While relevant to climate change mitigation, it doesn't address direct climate impacts on the United States. It also focuses on scenarios from EU countries and Japan, and not the US. "
10.1007/s10530-015-0944-x,gemini,"**Classification:** XU, XO  **Explanation:** This paper documents the extinction of an invasive species in the UK due to extreme weather events. While it relates to climate change and its impact on species, it contains **no United States specific information (XU)**, and so does not directly meet the criteria for inclusion in a U.S. National Climate Assessment review. Additionally, while impacts on ecosystems are within the scope of the review, this documents the loss of an *invasive* species and so the effect may not represent a negative impact. So it is being **excluded for another reason (XO)**. "
