A Bayesian approach (NUTS MCMC) is used for parameter estimation, with model selection based on AIC. Projections account for structural model uncertainty (assessment model configuration, Earth System Models/emission scenarios, climate coupling), parameter uncertainty, and process error in recruitment. The framework is applied to Pacific cod in the eastern Bering Sea, projecting stock status and fishery performance under different climate scenarios and harvest strategies, considering both time-varying and pre-specified parameters. Multiple assessment model configurations from the US North Pacific Fishery Management Council are used, some assuming future recruitment independent of environmental links. The study examines harvest control rules (e.g., 40-5, constant F) and catch limits from various climate scenarios (e.g., MIROC ssp126, GFDL ssp585), acknowledging the assumption of stationarity in environment-recruitment relationships and 'set and forget' management.",Chronic trends,,Regional,,Transitional (accounting for changes over time),,"Adaptation is considered through harvest control rules that adjust catch limits based on projected stock status and environmental scenarios.
