A proposed modification to the System of National Accounts (SNA) considers incorporating weather/climate disaster asset damage into capital consumption calculations. Analysis involves comparing the impact of treating disaster costs as shocks versus incorporating a trend. NOAA data, encompassing floods, storms, fires, droughts, and heat waves, is utilized to calculate trends in disaster costs alongside BEA data, demonstrating robustness across different calculation methods.","Highlights: Higher global temperatures correlate with negative economic impacts, varying significantly across socioeconomic scenarios. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and predictable, necessitating changes in asset value accounting. Inclusion of full disaster costs increases capital consumption volatility. Disaster costs, though a small percentage of NDP, are growing (0.12% in 1980 to 0.40% in 2023), highlighting an increasing trend.","Macroeconomic statistics should reflect the feedback loop between economic activity and the environment.

This is accomplished through a three-way fixed effects panel model using annual national shares of people exposed to TCs as predictors, with damages modeled as functions of global mean temperature (GMT) change. A probabilistic event-based TC damage model employing a TC emulator and scenario analysis is used, considering six uncertainty dimensions such as future greenhouse gas emissions and socioeconomic developments. Maximum entropy bootstrapping with 1200 bootstraps per country expresses model uncertainties in growth estimates, generating projections based on four global climate models over 2010-2100. An empirical growth model translates affected population shares into deviations in national GDP pathways. Mixed-effects modeling accounts for RCP random effects, and different growth-adjusted discount rates, including the Stern rate, quantify uncertainties over 120,000 realizations. The TC-impact assessment includes a discrete-time discount rate definition and calculates TC-induced SCC (TC-SCC) as the differential SCC with and without TCs. This analysis is implemented in Python using CLI-MADA and statsmodels and considers dimensions of damage persistence and historical growth responses to TCs. The methodology was collaboratively designed and executed, involving contributions to data and tools by multiple researchers.","Tropical cyclones (TCs) substantially increase the social cost of carbon (SCC), especially for major emitters such as the USA, China, and India. While one estimate suggests that including TC effects does not affect the results, others find that TC strikes reduce economic growth in the short-, mid-, and long-term, with cumulative growth losses increasing with the number of lag years. Growth losses increase with global mean temperature (GMT) in most TC-affected countries, and are dependent on country-specific characteristics rather than development level. The impact of TCs on SCC is determined by exposure and economic vulnerability, with the USA experiencing the largest increase in median SCC due to TCs. Lower- and middle-income countries face larger adaptation challenges relative to their income, although when damage is measured relative to average household income, damages for some upper-middle and lower-middle income countries become comparable to those of the USA. Uncertainty in climate models and discounting choices significantly affect damage and SCC estimates. The discount rate has the largest impact on SCC estimates. The Tropical Cyclone-induced SCC (TC-SCC) is defined as the difference between the SCC with and without the contribution of TCs.","This study investigates the persistent growth effects of tropical cyclones (TCs) on 174 countries (41 historically affected), focusing on the period 2010-2100.

Discounting is identified as a primary source of uncertainty. The study uses temperature-dependent, quasi-universal damage functions and considers the persistence of growth losses, national GHG emissions, and country-level TC-SCC tail risks. It acknowledges potential underestimation of impacts for lower-income populations and implicit inclusion of other impact channels (e.g., health) in the SCC estimate. The relationship between GMT and TC-induced growth changes depends on RCPs. The study applies a correction factor to simulated TC-affected people.

The model features recursive dynamics, regional disaggregation of the Legal Amazon, and land use modeling considering total available area, productivity, and profitability. Land use dynamics are modeled using a transition matrix based on Carvalho (2014) and calibrated with satellite and census data, allowing movement between agriculture, pasture, planted forest, and unused land categories. Sensitivity analysis uses a 50% interval with uniform distribution for parameter variations, applying Gaussian quadrature methodology.","Climate change poses significant macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks to Brazil, particularly impacting the Legal Amazon region due to its reliance on agriculture. Projected impacts include a decline in real GDP (e.g., a 1.18% loss in the Legal Amazon by 2049), reduced agricultural productivity (an average of 18% nationally), and changes in land use leading to deforestation. While some crops in specific regions may benefit, overall agricultural production in the Legal Amazon will be negatively affected, especially sugarcane. Mato Grosso and Tocantins are projected to be the most affected states. Reduced land productivity is anticipated to drive expansion of the agricultural frontier at the expense of pasture and forests.

Country-level climate data is derived from CMIP5, and crop yield impacts are estimated using an econometric model. Economic impacts are projected using GRACE. The analysis projects changes under different RCPs for the years 2050 and 2100, especially focusing on the RCP8.5 scenario, modelling land productivity and comparing grain production losses with and without adaptation. The methodology considers behavior adjustments of economic agents.","Global warming is projected to reduce global grain production, with temperature increases being the dominant factor. Under high emissions scenarios (RCP8.5), losses are widespread and largest by 2100, particularly impacting top grain producers like the USA, India, and China (in terms of output losses) and Russia (in terms of self-sufficiency). Lower emissions scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5) may initially offer short-term benefits for some countries, but eventually lead to losses. Adaptation can mitigate these losses, with varying effectiveness across countries (e.g., more effective in Brazil than China). While climate change impacts land productivity, production adjustments and behavioral responses can offset some of these direct effects, leading to relatively stable global grain consumption. Despite aggregate stability, regional disparities exist, with some countries like Canada, Germany, and Turkey potentially benefiting, while Russia faces reduced self-sufficiency requiring increased imports. Under RCP8.5 in 2100, higher grain prices benefit all regions, especially USA, China, India, and Pakistan.","This research examines the impact of climate change, particularly under RCP8.5 in 2100, on grain production and food security, focusing primarily on the agricultural sector in China (rice, wheat, maize, grain). Adaptation measures show potential to increase grain production. Analysis emphasizes temperature impacts on farm income and maize prices, but lacks broader macroeconomic/fiscal variables.

Regional temperature predictions from climate scenarios are also used.,"The analysis employs econometric techniques on a sub-national panel dataset for Russia (1995-2009) to estimate the impact of climate variables (temperature and precipitation) on regional government expenditures, representing public adaptation costs. Methodologically, the study utilizes both Fixed Effects (FE) and Linear/Long Difference (LD) models, with the LD model preferred for addressing omitted variable bias. Both linear and quadratic specifications for climate variables are explored. Models incorporate control variables and lagged temperature. Driscoll and Kraay standard errors (FE model) and heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors (LD model) address spatial/temporal dependence and heteroskedasticity, respectively. Robustness checks include removing outliers (5% tails) from climate variables. The LD model aims to capture longer-run impacts and potential adaptation, while the FE model focuses on short-term effects, providing a no-adaptation benchmark when analyzing short-term temperature variation. Regional impacts are projected onto national levels, using predicted regional temperature changes and regional temperature gradients.","Warming temperatures in Russia are generally associated with decreased regional government expenditures, particularly in colder regions and over the medium-to-long term. This effect is statistically significant and cumulative. While Russia may perceive net economic benefits from climate change, these gains are unevenly distributed. Projections suggest potential savings of USD 2-4 billion by the 2020s due to warming. Precipitation also negatively impacts housing expenditures. Heating degree days have a contrasting impact, increasing expenditures in colder regions but decreasing them in warmer ones, potentially due to limited air conditioning. The relationship between temperature and expenditure is non-linear, with short-term temperature increases reducing expenditures in cold regions, having a negligible impact in warmer regions, and reversing in the hottest regions.","Synopsis: The study, focused on Russia, uses temperature and precipitation as proxies for climate change to estimate impacts on regional expenditures, acknowledging this as a simplification. While warming trends in Russia are double the global average, potentially leading to longer growing seasons and energy demand shifts, perceived short-term economic benefits may conflict with long-term risks. Climate-related variables are often overlooked in public expenditure analysis. The econometric model considers annual weather variation and mid-term climate change, using regional data, deflated expenditure figures, and addressing geographic correlation and endogeneity issues (particularly with a Communist Party variable). Limited data and potential unaccounted variables, especially in the LD model, necessitate cautious interpretation. Growing degree days (GDD) do not significantly impact outcomes, possibly due to the limited role of regional governments in agriculture. The analysis primarily considers temperature changes and uses scenarios A2 and B1 and data until the 2020s due to increasing uncertainty in warming benefits beyond that timeframe.

The USA and India consistently appear among the hardest hit in terms of production losses, while they, along with China and Pakistan, may see benefits from rising grain prices under severe climate scenarios. Despite direct climate change impacts on land productivity, stable grain consumption and increased self-sufficiency rates are possible through offsetting production effects and economic adaptation. However, these impacts on self-sufficiency might be overestimated without accounting for the adaptive behavior of economic agents.","This research, likely originating from CICERO, models the impact of climate change, particularly under the RCP8.5 2100 scenario, on grain production in China and global food security, focusing on rice, wheat, and maize. Adaptation measures potentially increase grain production despite negative climate change impacts on land productivity. CO2 fertilization may increase global grain production under RCP2.6 and 4.5 scenarios. The analysis quantifies impacts on grain production, consumption, land use, self-sufficiency ratio (SSR), farm income, and maize prices, showing potential for adaptation to mitigate negative effects. The impact in 2100 is generally stronger than in 2050 for RCP4.5 and 8.5.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,Econometric,Chronic trends,Adaptive,,Sequential Interactions,Adaptive (reflecting shifts in economic behavior in response to impacts),,"Agricultural models, climate scenarios, and adaptation strategies are used to assess impacts on grain supply.

The model incorporates varying specifications of investment behavior including perfect foresight, myopic expectations, and imperfect foresight, to analyze economic resilience and the macroeconomic impact of water scarcity events. The analysis integrates foresight and resilience via investment closures using a 2020 Social Accounting Matrix as a foundation. The production structure is modeled using multi-level CES production functions. The study further uses sensitivity analysis on the Armington trade elasticity and incorporates scenarios by adjusting the water efficiency parameter, considering labor market dynamics like bargained real wages, involuntary unemployment, and sectoral labor mobility, while maintaining a fixed labor force.","Firms' foresight regarding water scarcity significantly influences macroeconomic and sectoral outcomes. Adequate anticipation and resilience-building measures bolster economic resilience, improving GDP and employment recovery following water scarcity events, especially if firms possess perfect foresight. Conversely, myopic expectations and imperfect foresight can lead to GDP decreases, employment declines, and over-investment, particularly impacting the agriculture, forestry & fishing sectors. Other affected sectors include chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing, electricity generation, and food and beverage industries, due to their reliance on agricultural inputs. Economic openness can enhance GDP and water use but may adversely affect employment. Investment behavior underpins the severity of macroeconomic impacts, with varied sector-specific consequences on GDP, employment, and water usage.","This analysis examines economic resilience to climate-related water scarcity in Germany, emphasizing behavioral factors like imperfect foresight and preparedness. It employs a modeling framework using a bargained real wage (BRW) function reflecting involuntary unemployment. While capable of analyzing migration, it focuses on sectoral impacts, particularly on agriculture, food, and electricity. Successive shocks under imperfect foresight are considered, and the analysis highlights the importance of foresight in mitigating negative economic consequences. Some manufacturing sectors may see gains, but these are offset by larger losses in agriculture and food. The results represent cumulative impacts over the simulation period.

*   General Circulation Models (GCMs)","The analysis primarily employs panel regression techniques using data from 50 US states and the District of Columbia, often weighted by GSP or industry output shares. The core methodology examines the relationship between state-level GSP growth (or industry output growth, productivity growth, employment growth) and average seasonal temperatures. The sample period often spans 1957-2012, with some analyses focusing on pre- and post-1997 subsamples to address industry classification changes (SIC to NAICS). Regression models commonly include state and year fixed effects, lagged dependent variables, and sometimes interaction terms (e.g., HDI and temperature). Standard errors are frequently clustered by year, state, and both dimensions. Robustness checks include alternative weighting schemes (population, area), alternative temperature measures/data sources (deseasonalization techniques, population-weighted temperature, gridded data, different seasonal definitions), controlling for precipitation and temperature volatility, excluding specific states, and addressing spatial correlation. The analysis also includes Arellano-Bond estimation for some specifications and Wald tests to assess the significance of coefficient sums. Select analyses combine estimated temperature impact coefficients with climate model projections to forecast future GDP impacts.","Rising summer temperatures in the U.S. are projected to negatively impact economic growth, potentially reducing it by up to one-third over the next century. This negative impact is pervasive across a wide range of industries, particularly in the South, with significant reductions in GDP growth for sectors like retail, wholesale, real estate, insurance, agriculture, forestry, and fishing. Several service sectors and finance industries also exhibit a statistically significant negative impact. While fall temperature increases can positively affect growth, this effect is weaker and less robust than the negative summer temperature effect. The negative impact of summer temperatures on GSP growth is robust across various methodologies and data sets, and is particularly driven by the months of July and August. Some sectors, like utilities, transportation, and mining, might experience positive impacts. The study also suggests potential effects on labor productivity and consumer behavior due to temperature changes. High emission scenarios exacerbate these negative economic growth impacts, and future research should focus on adaptation and mitigation strategies.","The study examines the impact of seasonal temperature fluctuations on U.S. state-level GSP (Gross State Product) growth. The analysis finds U.S. output is sensitive to temperature increases, particularly in Southern states, with summer temperature impacts dominating those of fall. The main mechanism appears to be productivity growth rather than employment growth. A decomposition approach reveals how summer temperature impacts are distributed across industries, with 'Agriculture' being the most exposed sector. The study uses panel regressions, weighting each state by its GSP proportion of national GDP, clustering standard errors by year and state. A data limitation exists due to industry classification changes in 1997, addressed by analyzing pre- and post-1997 samples separately. The impact of fall temperatures on GSP growth is less robust than that of summer. Robustness checks exclude lagged GSP growth, Alaska and Hawaii. Correlations between fall and summer temperatures are modest, not significantly affecting the results. A one standard deviation increase in summer temperature results in a change in the growth of GDP between -0.2 and +0.2 standard deviations, depending on the specific industry. Caution is advised in interpreting post-1997 results due to changes associated with the introduction of NAICS codes and a larger overall contribution of the South to the country's economic activity. The volatility of temperature contributes to GDP volatility, impacting welfare.

The dependent variable is typically GSP growth or industry output growth, and the key explanatory variables are average seasonal temperatures. Data sources include NOAA, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Methodological variations include: deseasonalization of weather data; aggregation of weather data at county and state levels using area or population weights; inclusion of state and year fixed effects; inclusion of lagged dependent variables; weighting states by GSP, population, or area; clustering standard errors by year, state, or both; performing Wald tests to assess the significance of temperature coefficient sums; using Arellano-Bond estimation; addressing spatial correlation; and conducting robustness checks with alternative GSP measures, temperature definitions, and sample periods. The analysis also uses climate model temperature projections to forecast the impact of temperature change on GDP growth and includes sector-specific regressions and analysis of temperature effects on human capital.","Rising summer temperatures are projected to negatively impact U.S. economic growth, potentially reducing it by up to one-third over the next century. This pervasive negative effect extends across many industries, particularly retail, wholesale, real estate, insurance, agriculture, forestry, and fishing. The South region is especially sensitive. While some sectors like utilities may benefit, overall, higher summer temperatures reduce labor productivity and gross state product (GSP) growth. Although identifying statistically significant effects of temperature on economic growth can be challenging, many analyses show a robust negative correlation between summer temperature and GSP growth, especially in developed states. Conversely, fall temperature increases show a weaker and less consistent positive effect. The negative summer temperature effect is primarily driven by July and August and is robust to various robustness checks. High emission scenarios could significantly reduce economic growth. Some service and finance industries also show a statistically significant negative impact from average summer temperature on output growth. Real estate, insurance, food services are among those negatively affected. Finally, temperature impacts human capital and time allocation, with implications for climate change.","The analysis examines the impact of seasonal temperature fluctuations, particularly summer and fall, on U.S. state-level Gross State Product (GSP) growth, focusing on the period from the 1960s to 2017. Panel regressions, weighting states by their GSP contribution to national GDP, suggest that U.S. output is sensitive to temperature increases, particularly in Southern states, with summer temperatures having the most significant impact. The primary mechanism through which temperature affects GSP growth is productivity growth, rather than employment. The impact is distributed unevenly across industries, with 'Agriculture' being the most exposed. The increased effect of temperature on GDP growth post-1997 may be driven by the South's larger contribution to the national economy. The results are robust to excluding lagged GSP growth, Alaska and Hawaii, but the effect of fall temperature is less robust. Data limitations, including changes in industry classifications in 1997, require caution in interpreting results, and the analysis is primarily US-focused, limiting external validity.

Gridded climate data (PRCP, PDSI) are regressed against gridded maize yields. Virtual water trade trends are analyzed in relation to food trade, given the dependence of VWT on VWC.","Highlights: Southern Africa's agricultural GDP and food security are highly vulnerable to climate variability, particularly drought. Severe droughts, such as in 1991-1992, significantly reduce crop yields, necessitating reliance on maize imports from the rest of the world to compensate for production shortfalls. Trade, particularly extra-regional, plays a crucial role in mitigating drought impacts by enabling the flow of food from more to less water-productive areas, leading to water savings and improved resource allocation. Rainfall increases positively correlate with agricultural GDP in some nations, while drought severity negatively impacts GDP in others. Irrigation use increases in drought years.","Trade liberalization can buffer declines in food production caused by climate change by facilitating international imports.

Generalized impulse response functions (GIRFs) are used to analyze output responses to positive and negative monetary policy shocks. Bank-level panel regressions and fixed effects models are used to investigate the credit channel, linking temperature shocks to bank loan portfolios and non-performing loan ratios. The robustness of the TVAR results is tested by varying the ordering of endogenous variables, data frequencies (monthly, daily, quarterly), and alternative dependent variables.

High temperatures weaken firm profitability, increase loan defaults and non-performing loan ratios, leading to climate-induced credit constraints that dampen the efficiency of monetary policy, especially expansionary measures. Monetary policy's impact on GDP is temperature-regime dependent, with tight monetary policy having a stronger effect under high-temperature regimes and expansionary policy being less effective. Temperature shocks also lead to larger fluctuations in economic outputs and lengthen the duration of divergence to steady states. These findings are robust to alternative output measures and data frequencies. Increases in temperature impede bank lending and affect the credit channel of monetary policy transmissions. Climate risks can impact market efficiency, damage banks, affect firm investment, impact total factor productivity, and have long-term macroeconomic effects.","Synopsis: This research investigates the impact of temperature shocks on monetary policy effectiveness in China, particularly through the bank credit channel. Higher temperatures increase banks' non-performing loan ratios, leading to credit constraints that weaken monetary policy transmission. The Time-Varying Vector Autoregression (TVAR) model, with temperature shocks, monetary policy, price level, and output as key variables, is used to analyze regime-dependent impulse responses of GDP to monetary policy shocks under high and low temperature conditions. Temperature is used as a threshold variable defining the regimes. The analysis uses data from 343 Chinese banks and considers controls like shadow banking, money stock, and GDP growth. Temperature shocks are defined as deviations from historical moving averages. The study finds that temperature increases weaken the efficiency of monetary easing and exacerbate the negative impacts of monetary tightening. Policymakers should consider climate change in monetary policy formulations, potentially adjusting the aggressiveness of expansionary and contractionary policies based on temperature.

They show consistent predictive performance, except for potential underestimation in high warming scenarios beyond training data. Temperature has a non-linear, inverted U-shaped relationship with GDP growth, influencing projections significantly, with notable variability across China's regions.

It distinguishes between level and growth effects, noting that repeated events can cause long-term income changes even without impacting growth rates. While total global effect uncertainty exists, individual regional impacts are often more certain. Historical average temperature changes have already caused significant, globally uniform economic losses, larger than those from extreme heat alone. The research isolates the causal impact of heat intensity on growth, adjusting for anthropogenic warming, and uses counterfactual GDPpc calculations to estimate damage, emphasizing the use of the empirical regression only for calculating accumulated economic damages, not for constructing data.

It also considers scenarios with commodity price fluctuations and uncertain grant revenues.","The analysis develops a methodology for fiscal policy rules in countries vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change, focusing on Pacific Island countries. It proposes and evaluates a recurrent expenditure rule, interdependently determined by government debt and budget balance targets, incorporating probabilistic disaster shocks. The approach uses both empirical and normative methods to evaluate debt targets and explores different fiscal rules (debt, budget balance, expenditure, and revenue rules) and cash buffers. Methodologically, the study employs a fiscal reaction function, incorporates natural disaster shocks into debt sustainability frameworks, and uses steady-state analysis to analyze the effects of permanent shocks on debt dynamics. It considers scenarios with positive technological shocks and dampened economic activity, deriving expenditure rules from budget balance targets and calibrating a natural disaster-resilient fiscal rule based on cash-flow constraints. The permanent income hypothesis is calibrated to determine the optimal non-resource primary balance for commodity exporters, and a forward-looking explanation mechanism is suggested for fiscal authorities.","Fiscal rules are crucial for managing macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks from climate change and natural disasters, particularly in developing countries and Pacific Islands. A recurrent expenditure rule based on non-resource and non-grant revenue, interdependently determined by debt and budget balance targets, is advocated for its practical applicability and countercyclical properties. This rule allows for disaster recovery spending without relying on potentially inaccurate GDP growth estimations and reduces procyclicality. Investment-friendly rules are also vital due to significant infrastructure needs amplified by disasters. Operational simplicity is favored given institutional capacity constraints in Pacific Islands. While natural disasters can affect sustainable debt-to-GDP ratios, the effects on growth and interest rates are ambiguous. Steady-state debt levels are sensitive to parameters and can be impacted by both positive technology shocks from reconstruction and negative economic impacts of climate change. Using the headline budget balance as an anchor and focusing on expenditure rules based on stable revenue is recommended to reduce fiscal volatility. Exclusion of volatile resource revenues from fiscal rules and the establishment of stabilization funds/cash buffers are also important. Escape clauses for unexpected disasters require clear definition and forward-looking explanations for credibility. Recurrent expenditure rules, coupled with debt targets, offer a viable framework for managing disaster risks and volatile revenues, offering a means to guide fiscal policy and determine the appropriate magnitude of fiscal stimulus.","The study focuses on small states and developing countries, particularly commodity exporters reliant on grants and prone to natural disasters, using PNG as a case study due to data availability and suggests the methods can be applied to other Pacific, Caribbean, and Indian Ocean nations. It examines fiscal rules and mechanisms, including escape clauses, in the context of natural disasters and climate change, with a forward-looking approach similar to inflation targeting. Remittances are noted as important for disaster mitigation, and many developing countries exhibit procyclical fiscal policy where fiscal balance positively correlates with output. The impact of disaster shocks is considered in terms of budget balance, but the paper simplifies reconstruction's effect on total factor productivity by treating it as permanent. Governments must consider private sector recovery efforts when determining their own disaster loss coverage. Fiscal rules can automatically determine public investment based on natural disaster shocks. Expenditure ceilings, particularly on personnel costs, can aid budget management in countries with limited capacity. Foreign aid for disaster relief is often delayed and may not be budgeted for, highlighting the need for improved public financial management and expenditure controls. Public investment funded by grants won't impact debt targets. The permanent income hypothesis is relevant for commodity exporters. The budget deficit target presented is illustrative, and the steady-state growth rate is unaffected by countercyclical fiscal policy.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,Stylised,Acute shocks,Permanent,Regional,Sequential Interactions,Adaptive (reflecting shifts in economic behavior in response to impacts),,"Adaptation is primarily addressed through proposed fiscal rules designed to build resilience to natural disasters and climate change impacts.

Optimization functions couple physical and economic components. Specific applications include agent-based models simulating coastal homeowner abandonment decisions under various sea-level-rise, storm surge, and policy scenarios (e.g., beach nourishment subsidies), incorporating individual perceptions and forecasts of environmental change. These models extend previous work and often involve coupling numerical models of barrier-island evolution with agent-based models of tourism development to simulate long-term dynamics.","Highlights: Developed barrier islands are coupled human-natural systems where climate change risks, such as sea-level rise and increased storm surge, interact with economic and policy decisions. Market divestment from precarious coastal properties is possible. Traditional unidirectional approaches to coastal management are insufficient; feedback loops, exemplified by beach nourishment, are critical. Holistic management is needed to prevent resource depletion and economic disparities. Disbelief in climate models exacerbates property damage and creates equity issues. Increased storm magnitude reduces the time to abandonment and raises cumulative damage. Nourishment subsidies extend abandonment time but also increase overall damage. Belief in predictive models decreases both abandonment time and damage under high sea-level rise. Physical, policy, and psychological factors contribute to systemic instability. Developed coastlines and resort economies are susceptible to boom-and-bust cycles tied to barrier island abandonment. Hazard mitigation focused on small-scale storms can inadvertently worsen the impact of large storm events, while even moderate development can reduce erosion.","The agent-based model simulates coastal homeowners' behavior on developed barrier islands under sea-level rise and subsidy scenarios, focusing on abandonment, damage, and the timing of systemic instability. It incorporates heterogeneous economic agents (developers, hotel owners, tourists) and a policy agent enacting beach nourishment based on cost-benefit analysis.

Climate variability is a critical determinant of TFP growth variability, highlighting the shifting dynamics in agricultural productivity. The sensitivity of TFP to climate variables notably increased post-1980, with a substantial shift in correlations between temperature and productivity. Projections under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios indicate a pronounced decline in TFP by 2050, with greater reductions under RCP 8.5. Adaptation and technological advancements are essential to offset climate-induced productivity losses, which could exceed model predictions due to diminishing water resources and changing regulatory impacts. Irrigation historically mitigated productivity impacts from precipitation, but future TFP reductions may accelerate. The increased importance of crop production has heightened TFP sensitivity to climate. Projected declines and sector-specific contributions indicate significant shifts in agricultural value composition in the US.

FrEDI is driven by 10,000 probabilistic scenarios of global greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O), US population, and US GDP from the Resources for the Future‚ÄìSocioeconomic Projections (RFF-SPs). Emission trajectories are input to the Finite Amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model (v1.6.2) to project global mean surface temperature, which then drives FrEDI to calculate climate-driven damages. CONUS temperature is estimated as 1.42 times global temperature, and a semi-empirical approach is used for sea level rise impacts. Sector-specific, temperature-binned damage functions are extrapolated to account for the full range of temperature scenarios. The analysis calculates marginal climate-driven damages as the difference between baseline and perturbed cases, discounting these to the year of emissions and aggregating across the time series into a net present damage estimate, often using Ramsey discounting calibrated to a near-term target discount rate of 2%. While some analyses focus on impacts through 2090, others extend projections to 2300, using techniques like extrapolating damage functions, adjusting damages based on GDP per capita, and holding adjustments constant at 2090 levels.

A primary driver of monetary damages is premature mortality due to temperature changes, with health and infrastructure (transportation) also significantly impacted. These impacts are projected to worsen existing societal inequalities, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and racial/ethnic groups, particularly regarding air quality and labor losses. There are significant regional and sectoral variations in climate change impacts. Proactive adaptation measures consistently reduce damage estimates. Temperature-related mortality damages exhibit wide ranges across studies and are heavily influenced by socioeconomic drivers. Uncertainty in damage estimates increases over time, while lower discount rates result in higher valuations of climate change damage.","The analysis, focusing on climate change impacts within the contiguous US (CONUS), employs the FrEDI model across 20 sectors with damage functions tailored to each sector, region, and GCM, using 2020 US dollars.

Methodology includes: Block bootstrap estimation (often with 500 repetitions) to account for parameter uncertainty, bias-corrected spatial disaggregation (BCSD) to downscale climate model data, and estimation of response functions centred vertically so that the exposure-weighted marginal effect is zero. Uncertainty is addressed through bootstrapping coefficients and using General Circulation Models (GCMs). Model robustness is assessed via placebo checks involving randomly reshuffling TFP and weather data by year and country, often with a large number of reshuffled datasets (e.g., 10,000). Model selection and validation techniques include comparing various specifications (quadratic/cubic functional forms, different weighting schemes, growing season definitions, heterogeneity assumptions) and k-fold cross-validation (typically tenfold) to assess model fit, focusing on out-of-sample mean squared error (MSE) reduction relative to a model that excludes weather variables.

This involves linking crop simulation models (CSM-CERES-wheat and LINGRA) with the Jordmod farm sector model, a price-endogenous, spatial, comparative-static, partial equilibrium model. The crop models simulate crop yields based on weather and soil data, which are then used as input into Jordmod. Jordmod simulates farm and food industry optimization, including minimizing industry costs and modeling final market supply and demand. The framework analyzes effects on crop yields, agricultural production, land use, and social welfare. Scenarios are run with variations in climate, policy, and farm management parameters, assuming a uniform probability distribution. The study uses emission scenario A1B for 2050, GCM HADCM3 climate data, and past budget support variations. Technical progress is modeled independently of yield changes. The approach is a cascade, with crop model output feeding into the economic model without feedback. Decomposition of meat production into red and white meat is used to assess impacts.","Highlights: Climate change and policy uncertainty, particularly their combined effects, significantly impact agricultural production, income, and resource allocation. Cereals show potential yield increases by 2050, yet climate uncertainty drives variance in production, especially for crops. Animal production is less sensitive than crop production, with milk quotas limiting responses to increased payments. While combined uncertainties can reduce agricultural area and labor, they also increase average farm income, though climate uncertainty contributes to higher income volatility. Market regulation moderates the impact of policy uncertainty. Producers exhibit greater sensitivity to climate and policy uncertainty than consumers. Uncertainties affect land and milk quota rents, with policy uncertainty having a larger impact on land rent volatility. While average agricultural income and social welfare remain relatively stable across uncertainty scenarios, climate change increases variance in farm income despite higher averages.","This study focuses on the Norwegian agricultural sector, modeling the impact of climate change and policy uncertainty on crop and animal production, particularly land and milk. The analysis considers direct climate impacts on crop yields (not animal production), using climate projections for 2046-65. It explores the effects of shifting from climate-sensitive cereal production to forage-based animal production. White meat production is less impacted by policy due to fewer subsidies. Decreased cereal production coupled with increased dairy farming results in a higher mean agricultural income.

The model incorporates region-specific emissions and damages, using pattern scaling to determine regional temperatures. The climate module is based on DICE (Nordhaus, 2017) but parameterized using Folini et al. (2024). Damage functions are based on Krusell and Smith (2022). Energy production and consumption are modeled with a Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) function between dirty and clean energy sources.

The model uses an iterative process, including backward induction, to solve for optimal carbon tax paths based on the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC).","Highlights:

Carbon taxation, coupled with strategic transfers, can mitigate climate damage and enhance overall welfare, although achieving uniform gains may require significant compensatory payments to future generations. Global carbon taxation can limit peak global damages by 44.3% and equates to a 4.3% increase in annual consumption per cohort under an optimal ""universal welfare improvement"" (UWI) policy. China's participation is crucial for effective carbon policy, and delaying implementation reduces its effectiveness. The speed of transitioning to clean energy has limited impact on optimal carbon tax paths.

Absent policy, average global temperatures could rise significantly, leading to substantial GDP losses, especially in regions like India (up to 40%). The magnitude of damages is highly sensitive to the damage function, with peak global GDP loss potentially reaching 17% under more severe scenarios. A UWI carbon policy can achieve welfare gains for all generations and limit the tax burden on future generations, reducing temperature rise and fossil fuel usage.

Optimal initial carbon taxes are highly sensitive to the damage function, potentially exceeding $700 in no-transfer scenarios, although regional differences in welfare gains exist, with low-income regions like India potentially incurring high net tax costs. The social cost of carbon (SCC) varies substantially across regions and scenarios, increasing over time. Coal usage is particularly impacted by carbon taxes. While China is projected to surpass the US economically regardless of carbon policy, India's share of global output is significantly affected. Imperfect substitutability of clean energy reduces the gains from carbon policy. Partial international participation in carbon tax policy has limited effects. Some regions may initially benefit from warming while hotter regions will be harmed.","The study analyzes a Uniform Welfare Improvement (UWI) carbon tax policy across regions, considering different UWI variants: uniformly shared gains (UWI), gains solely for future generations (UWIF), and a 10% net tax limit (UWIL). Carbon tax revenues are rebated lump-sum to dirty energy producers. The model incorporates regional output technologies, dirty energy production, capital mobility, increasing dirty energy extraction costs (approaching infinity as reserves deplete), and an IMF-like international institution coordinating global carbon policy and assessing net taxes. Regional temperatures are GDP-weighted averages. Canada and ANZ are modeled separately. The model accounts for both climate change damages (GDP losses) and gains (GDP increases, especially for Russia and Canada under BAU). Higher damages limit output and emissions. UWI policies cause capital crowding out and raise global interest rates. Even with differing compensation schemes, carbon taxation can keep temperature rise near the 2.0-degree Paris Agreement limit. UWI may require poorer, highly impacted regions to subsidize richer, higher-emitting regions, although Indians still benefit overall. Results are for the '6x damage scenario', where 'Optimal' policy is UWIL. Analysis highlights the potential unenforceability of redistributive aspects due to high future taxes, but even temporary GDP shocks can significantly impact welfare, particularly in impoverished regions. The optimal carbon tax path is relatively unaffected by short- to medium-term substitutability of clean for dirty energy. The model details region-specific paths for various economic variables (output, factor demands, interest rates, wages, energy prices, etc.). The 'UWI' definition is missing. The paper provides estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), which are important for cost-benefit analyses of mitigation and adaptation policies, although these are based on broad regional aggregates.

Demographic change flattens the growth path, with rising old-age dependency negatively impacting trend growth. Climate change risks can lower savings ratios and increase depreciation rates, decreasing the growth path level. Empirical findings indicate a significant negative relationship between disaster days and savings rates, and the effect of old-age dependency ratio on savings rate changes over time. Consequently, successful climate policy, by raising savings ratios, could affect the cost of capital and modernization efforts needed for sustainability and climate neutrality.","Synopsis: The analysis considers the impact of climate change, measured by the number of days of natural disasters, on economic growth, accounting for factors such as savings rates, per-capita income, and old-age dependency ratios.

The methodology involves: 1) Simulating daily inundation depth using the MATSIRO land surface model and CaMa-Flood inundation model; 2) Determining asset damage based on land use data (GLCNMO v2, GRUMPv1), damage-depth functions, and asset coefficients; 3) Deriving gridded GDP based on building height data (using a formula calibrated with subnational data from 11 countries) and World Bank data; 4) Calculating BI loss using inundation period, GDP data, and a proportional constant derived from flood surveys; 5) Validating results against EM-DAT and World Bank data, and comparing against previous studies. The analysis includes reanalysis simulations (1960-2013, using S14FD-Reanalysis) and GCM simulations (historical 1961-2005, future RCP8.5 2006-2098, using S14FD-GCM and SSP3).

The effect of flood protection levels (FPLs) is assessed by comparing outcomes with and without flood protection (using the FLOPROS database), and BI loss is often presented as a percentage of GDP.","Flood-related business interruption (BI) losses can be significant, even comparable to direct asset damage. The study models BI loss and asset damage at high resolution based on inundation period and depth, linking building height to GDP per capita. BI loss estimation is based on flood impacts on productivity in secondary and tertiary industries, with validation against real-world events. Model results show reasonable accuracy for global averages, with BI loss estimates in several countries aligning with World Bank values. River basins with long inundation periods and shallow slopes are particularly vulnerable to BI loss impacting GDP. Climate change is projected to significantly increase both BI loss and asset damage, with substantial regional variation. Previous studies focusing solely on asset damage likely underestimated the true economic impact of floods. Flood protection measures significantly reduce BI loss and asset damage, with a greater effect on BI loss. The ratio of BI loss to asset damage varies regionally and is influenced by flood protection levels, slope, and inundation period, with projections indicating potential increases in this ratio in some regions despite existing flood protection. BI loss is a critical factor often underestimated in global flood risk assessments.","The study models business interruption (BI) loss from floods in river basins (‚â•10,000 km2), using GDP data (World Bank, SSP3 projections), flood protection standards, and a damage-depth function based on Huizinga et al.

Results are compared to Ward et al. and Alfieri et al. for validation and consider asset damage alongside BI loss. High-order propagation effects are not estimated. BI loss is defined as flood-related business interruption only, potentially underestimating total impact. BI loss can exceed asset damage in some areas, highlighting its importance.

The analyzed paper investigates the macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks of climate change by focusing on the social cost of carbon dioxide (SCCO2) and adaptation strategies. Highlights include the necessity of understanding climate-economy feedbacks, impact persistence, and climate extremes in assessing SCCO2 and its uncertainty. The PAGE-ICE model updates involve detailed capture of permafrost feedback, sea ice decline, and CO2/CH4 sink dynamics, revealing that SCCO2 is significantly higher in these revisions, doubling the earlier PAGE09 values and mostly affecting the Global South. Persistent damage effects and inadequate adaptation exacerbate income redistribution and risk economic contraction in poorer regions. SCCO2 is notably sensitive to temperature variances, long-term feedbacks, and specific parameter changes, with persistent damages playing a crucial role. The paper defines the importance of precise temperature pulse size estimation and explores how temperature-related GDP growth effects vary with income levels and model parameters. The study also emphasizes that high-temperature variability lacks strong regional evidence to influence mean SCCO2 estimations. Filtering adjusts persistence measures, and divergence is noted across global climate zones and income levels. Regional temperature sensitivity affects GDP outcomes differently amidst rising global temperatures, highlighting the intricate interplay of climate dynamics on macroeconomic structures.","The study compares a climate-economy model (PAGE-ICE) with its predecessor (PAGE09), attributing Social Cost of Carbon Dioxide (SCCO2) changes to model updates, including climate sensitivity adjustments aligned with IPCC AR5 and explicit modeling of Arctic feedbacks and catastrophic sea level rise.

First, a Structural Vector Auto-Regressive (SVAR) model is used to document the transmission mechanisms of weather shocks, using a soil moisture-based weather index. Restrictions are imposed to reflect New Zealand's small open economy and exogenous weather. A lower triangular Choleski decomposition is used to derive orthogonal impulse responses. The SVAR model is further used for Monte-Carlo simulations to model the effects of weather shocks. Second, a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model, incorporating a weather-dependent agricultural sector and time-varying land productivity, is estimated using Bayesian techniques and quarterly data. The agricultural sector employs a Cobb-Douglas production function, and weather is treated as an exogenous AR(1) process. The model is solved using a first-order approximation to the policy function and estimated using the dynare package and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Bayesian model comparison and posterior odds ratios are used to compare the DSGE model with alternative specifications, including one without weather damage and the SVAR. The model is estimated using New Zealand data, with variables transformed for stationarity. Prior distributions are specified for various parameters, adapted from previous studies. The estimated model is then used for simulations, including counterfactual analyses based on IPCC climate change projections for 2100, modifying weather shock variances. Impulse response functions (IRFs) are generated to analyze short-run and long-run impacts, and variance decomposition is performed to assess the contribution of different shocks. Welfare costs are computed using a second-order approximation to the welfare index, estimating the fraction of consumption households would be willing to give up to live in an economy free of weather shocks. Business cycle moments are compared to their empirical counterparts, and historical decompositions are performed.","Weather shocks have a substantial impact on New Zealand's macroeconomic variables, particularly GDP and agricultural output, and their effects are intensified by climate change, which increases macroeconomic volatility and welfare costs. The study proposes a quantitative framework to evaluate weather shocks' influence on business cycles, emphasizing their significance for agriculture-driven economies. Severe droughts have historically disrupted New Zealand's economy, causing declines in agricultural production and GDP, and affecting sectors like labor and the current account.

Weather shocks are treated as standard negative supply shocks, leading to reductions in agricultural output, consumption, and investment, as well as an increase in hours worked. The resulting recessions from drought shocks demonstrate persistent effects, especially in labor markets. The study introduces weather variables to model soil moisture's effect on production, showing the complexity of adapting to such shocks through mechanisms like irrigation and changes in land maintenance spending.

Model analyses using DSGE and SVAR highlight the macroeconomic fluctuations and the volatility of key variables such as GDP and real exchange rates. Climate change scenarios worsen these fluctuations, with higher welfare costs and non-trivial effects on permanent consumption. The paper also identifies significant co-movements between sectors due to the imperfect substitutability of labor, with the tertiary sector expanding post-drought shocks. The models indicate increasing uncertainty of weather shocks in different climate scenarios and provide insights into the nature of business cycle fluctuations in New Zealand driven by weather events.","The study develops a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model with a weather-dependent agricultural sector to assess the macroeconomic impacts of climate change, particularly focusing on increased climate variance. The model is calibrated using New Zealand data, treating weather as exogenous and drought indices as autoregressive. Key assumptions include limited human impact on drought occurrence, a short forecast horizon for farmers, no CO2 feedback loop, and hysteresis effects in agricultural production. The model incorporates external consumption habits, aversion, and labor disutility. It replicates observed economic means and volatility, with the parameter Œ∏ being potentially critically high. The model's strength lies in its micro-founded mechanisms propagating weather shocks and capturing the role of foreign shocks. Increased weather shock contribution over time suggests persistence via hysteresis. Sensitivity analysis focuses on land expenditure cost (œÜ) and labor sectoral cost (Œπ). Scenarios with decreased (optimistic) and increased (pessimistic) weather shock variance are analyzed. The model may underestimate climate change impacts in developing economies. The framework could be used to evaluate monetary and fiscal policy responses to weather shocks.

The model simulates agricultural production, consumption, and trade, considering factors like crop yields, water availability, population and income growth. Drought effects are incorporated as exogenous shocks to crop yields and/or acreage, and drought frequency data from 2000-2016 is used to project future drought occurrences. The model is validated against FAOSTAT data. Authors' computations use the results from IMPACT 3.2 to project various impacts of drought. Food security estimation utilizes equations and coefficients from Fischer et al. (2005). Crop yield penalties and food price changes are calculated using FAOSTAT (2018) data, while food insecurity rates are derived from Southern African Development Community (2016) and World Bank (2018) data.","Recurrent droughts in Southern Africa are projected to severely impact food security by 2040, primarily through reduced maize production. Most countries will likely experience a substantial increase in the number of people at risk of hunger, becoming more import-dependent for staple foods. While drought impacts vary by crop and country (with some crops like tobacco potentially benefiting in certain regions), overall crop production indices decline under drought scenarios. Diversification away from maize and promotion of drought-tolerant crops like cowpea and cassava are suggested as potential adaptation strategies to enhance food security. Model projections indicate increasing risk of food insecurity between 2024 and 2040, with the peak impact expected between 2028 and 2032.","The study assesses the impact of droughts on food security in Southern Africa, using the IMPACT 3.2 model and focusing on specific drought years (e.g., June 2016 after two drought years). It highlights the varying vulnerability of countries based on crop specializations and drought severity, noting South Africa's crucial role as a maize producer and exporter. The model captures observed price effects, reflecting policy responses, and distinguishes between traded and non-traded commodities. While the model validates against past data, it primarily assesses agricultural production levels, not direct macroeconomic or fiscal impacts, and may underestimate indirect drought effects on food security by not incorporating industrial and service sector impacts.

A placebo test is also conducted by randomly assigning the ACI index across time.","The analysis employs a combination of macroeconomic and microeconomic methods. At the aggregate level, a five-variable Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model is used, incorporating a Chinese Aggregate Climate Index (ACI), GDP, CPI, interest rate, and total credit, spanning from 2001 Q1 to 2020 Q4. Cholesky decomposition is used to identify weather shocks, and impulse response functions and variance decompositions are performed. Counterfactual analysis is also employed to assess the impact of monetary policy responses. At the firm level, panel regression analysis with firm and time fixed effects is conducted, typically using Chinese listed companies between 2006 Q1 and 2020 Q4. These regressions explore the impact of the ACI (often lagged) on variables such as bank loans, value added, expected default frequency (EDF), and analyst ratings, considering moderating factors like economic policy uncertainty, financial stress, leverage, and local government debt. Robustness checks include placebo tests using resampled ACI data, alternative ACI constructions, and exclusion of data from crisis periods (2008-2009, 2020).","Extreme weather shocks have persistent negative effects on GDP, credit access, and firm-level output. These shocks cause a rise in expected default risk and decrease loans obtained by firms, particularly among non-state-owned, younger, and smaller firms. The Aggregate Climate Index (ACI) measures these weather risks and shows increasing trends in recent years. The impacts vary by region, industry, and the firm‚Äôs financial health. Essentially, the economic effects are more pronounced in provinces with high economic policy uncertainty and where local government borrowing restricts corporate borrowing. 

Monetary policies are significant in mitigating these adverse effects; otherwise, they exacerbate credit and GDP contractions post weather shocks. High collateral and corporate confidence can moderate these negative impacts. Adverse weather influences output markets with a two-quarter lag but affects credit markets faster. Extreme temperature, droughts, and floods typically reduce bank loan values relative to assets, while strong winds seem to provide a curious positive effect.

Adaptation measures help mitigate some of these effects, particularly regarding household consumption. ACI is linked to significant variance in GDP, CPI, interest rates, and credit, especially in the short term. Financial uncertainties correlate with macroeconomic outcomes, underscoring the importance of reinforcing monetary policies and adapting to rising climate risks.","This study analyzes the macroeconomic and firm-level impacts of weather shocks in China, focusing on listed companies and their credit access.

The analysis estimates damage elasticities and identifies factors influencing efficiency in adaptation, ultimately ranking countries based on their adaptation performance. Costs are not directly measured, but inferred through the impacts of adaptation on reducing disaster losses given a country's income and efficiency.","The analysis primarily relies on ex-post observations, as evidenced by the extensive use of empirical and regression analyses based on historical data and past events. The consistent use of panel data, cross-sectional data, and econometric methods to explore relationships between macroeconomic factors and climate-related outcomes suggests a reliance on observed historical data to derive conclusions.","The paper models adaptation as driven by supply and demand factors, influenced by income and efficiency considerations. It develops a theoretical model and uses empirical modeling to assess country efficiency in disaster management. The paper also explores the relationship between income and climate security, studying the adaptation deficit.","The paper highlights the benefits of ""soft options"" such as informational and institutional interventions in reducing macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks of climate change. These interventions improve disaster management efficiency, reduce fatalities, and minimize economic damages from natural disasters. The empirical analyses suggest that efficiency and adaptation spillovers are crucial for enhancing national resilience. By optimizing the supply and demand for adaptation and improving institutional frameworks, countries with stronger informational and institutional interventions experience better outcomes in terms of reduced disaster impact and enhanced economic stability. These interventions are particularly beneficial for countries with similar socio-economic and institutional characteristics as those studied.","This paper understands sufficient adaptation levels implicitly through a country's efficiency in disaster management, primarily focusing on reducing fatalities and economic damages from floods and tropical cyclones. Being ""well-adapted"" translates to a higher efficiency ranking, indicating the country minimizes losses (deaths and economic damages) relative to its income, hazard exposure, and other socioeconomic factors. The paper uses regression analysis and efficiency indices to quantify this, suggesting that well-adapted countries achieve lower disaster impacts given their circumstances.",

Methodologies include: panel regressions with county and year fixed effects, long difference estimations (including a 5-year differencing period) as robustness checks, and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) using Cobb-Douglas (CD-SFA) and Transcendental Logarithmic (TL-SFA) production functions with and without constant returns to scale (CRS). Non-linear relationships between weather variables and agricultural outcomes are modeled using temperature bins and piecewise linear approaches. Adaptation is quantified by comparing short-run impacts from panel estimates with long-run impacts from long differences estimates. Spatial correlation is addressed by clustering standard errors at the county level. Inverse distance weighting (IDW) is used to estimate weather conditions from weather station data. Future impacts on agricultural TFP are projected using climate projections from WorldClim-Global Climate Data under various RCPs (using climate models HadGEM2-ES and NorESM1-M) and bootstrap procedures are used to quantify uncertainty.","Extreme heat negatively impacts China's agricultural TFP and yield, primarily through adverse effects on input utilization (labor, fertilizer). The relationship between temperature and TFP is non-linear, with TFP decreasing sharply above 33¬∞C. Longer-run adaptation strategies partially offset these negative impacts, compensating for 37.9% to 64.36% of the short-run effects, but this offset may diminish over time without further policy interventions. The negative impact on yield is generally larger than on TFP. Future warming is projected to significantly lower agricultural TFP and yield, despite adaptation efforts.","This study analyzes climate change impacts and adaptation in China's agricultural sector, utilizing weather data from 820 stations matched to 2495 counties. Key findings include that adaptation strategies like changing crops and input portfolios can mitigate negative impacts on agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) and yields, offsetting 38.1% of TFP reductions in the midterm and 28.2% in the long term. Adaptation estimates are based on the difference between panel and long-difference estimates, showing increasing adaptation over time. The analysis identifies a nonlinear relationship between temperature and agricultural outcomes, with long-term reductions in TFP and yield exceeding those predicted by panel data.

The methodology is designed to handle countries with varying credit spreads and debt structures and aims to evaluate variable effects across the entire spread distribution and different maturities.

Key methodological elements include:
*   **Data Imputation:** Random Forest (RF) is used to impute missing data in sovereign yield spreads and predictor variables, maximizing dataset size.
*   **Dimension Reduction:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to estimate a time-varying common factor representing global macroeconomic forces and market shocks.
*   **Econometric Approach:** Panel quantile regression is the primary analytical tool, allowing for analysis of determinants across different quantiles of the sovereign spread distribution. Both distribution-free and likelihood-based methods are considered. Variables are often scaled to zero mean and unit variance before estimation. The analysis also incorporates macroeconomic, fiscal, and institutional covariates, and the ND-GAIN index to assess climate vulnerability and readiness for adaptation.

*   **Sample:** The analysis uses a sample of 68 countries (N=68). The years 2020 and 2021 are excluded.","Sovereign risk reacts asymmetrically to its determinants. Climate change vulnerability increases sovereign borrowing costs, particularly for short-term debt in high-risk countries and long-term debt in low-risk countries and European nations. Climate change preparedness can mitigate sovereign risk, especially at longer maturities and for low-risk countries, but may be insufficient to counteract vulnerability, especially in countries with elevated borrowing costs. Higher debt-to-GDP ratios, inflation, and climate change vulnerability contribute to higher spreads, while improved institutions and economic complexity contribute to lower spreads. External factors, particularly economic shocks, significantly impact sovereign risk, especially in short-term maturities. Natural disasters generally have a modest or insignificant effect on sovereign spreads compared to climate change vulnerability, with some mixed findings on the direction of impact. The impact of sovereign risk determinants differs across spread quantiles, highlighting varying risks for emerging/developing economies versus advanced economies. Economic complexity is a reliable predictor of future fiscal crises and lower borrowing costs. Emerging and low-income countries are disproportionately affected by climate change, impacting higher quantiles of the spread distribution. Data availability issues impacted the analysis of sovereign spreads across countries and maturities. Panel quantile models and random forests are effective methods for analyzing these relationships.","Synopsis: IDB Working Paper 1588 explores the implications of asymmetric sovereign risk for climate change preparation in Latin America and the Caribbean. The study emphasizes the importance of considering the conditional distribution of credit spreads when assessing climate-related sovereign risk, especially for countries with high spreads and short-term debt. Climate change effects disproportionately affect countries with higher spreads and reliance on short-term debt. Climate change readiness influences sovereign borrowing costs, mirroring the magnitude (but with opposite signs) of vulnerability effects, though it provides less attenuation for high-quantile spreads at shorter maturities. The paper investigates the impact of natural disasters (measured by number of people affected, deaths, and percentage of economic loss to GDP) on yield spreads, finding spreads are higher in six cases due to increments in disasters in the third category. The model accounts for key determinants of sovereign debt (macroeconomic, institutional, and fiscal variables), concluding the link between climate change and sovereign risk is influenced by these contexts rather than direct effects. A challenge for sustaining climate change funding schemes in the long term due to the amplification of climate change effects is highlighted, along with the importance of monitoring efforts to minimize systemic risk from natural disasters due to climate change. The paper also addresses the issue of missing data in sovereign yield datasets by employing a Random Forest model to impute missing values, using a time-varying factor as an alternative to explicitly including macro-forces. The effects of explanatory variables are most pronounced in short-term maturities, particularly within the highest quantiles of spreads, with individual variables exhibiting greater explanatory power for the center and left tail of the spread distribution for shorter maturities, and on the center and right tail for longer maturities.

Specific examples include computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, economic supply and demand models, flooding damages models, and integrated assessment models (e.g., GCAM-USA, ReEDS, IPM¬Æ). Econometric methods often estimate marginal effects of climate variables (e.g., temperature on crime, energy expenditures, labor productivity). Simulation approaches sometimes parameterize stressor/response relationships from engineering literature or use perfect foresight assumptions. Some studies, like CIRA, emphasize simulation modeling, while others, like the Risky Business Project, emphasize econometric estimates. Models can incorporate carbon fertilization, sea level rise scenarios, and city-specific mortality relationships. Valuation often uses value of statistical life (VSL) or willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates. Flexible macroeconomic models (e.g., RHG-MUSE) can integrate direct costs and benefits of climate change and consider intersectoral effects, including substitutions in response to price changes. The literature lacks universally accepted methodological tenets, and assessments often suffer from incomplete coverage of extreme events or sectors.","Climate change poses significant economic risks to the US, including large annual damages and substantial cumulative losses by 2100, with potential GDP impacts. Key vulnerabilities include infrastructure (roads, bridges), coastal resources, agriculture (carbon fertilization, water availability, ozone effects), electricity demand/power system costs, and labor productivity. Adaptation strategies are crucial and likely costly, requiring a balance between adaptation costs and avoided impact costs, with possible limits to adaptation. Constrained adaptation adds uncertainty to impact calculations. Mitigation policies are effective in reducing impacts, particularly on infrastructure, and in maximizing recreational benefits (e.g., coral reef preservation). Health impacts exhibit high uncertainty, with mortality rates potentially increasing significantly under high emissions scenarios. Climate-driven crime increases can be economically significant. Economic impact assessments are improving but require greater sectoral coverage, better understanding of cross-sectoral effects, and a focus on extreme events. Models like RHG-MUSE can reduce the overall cost of direct climate impacts and be updated with new data. The US may be poorly adapted to current coastal risks.","Synopsis: Motivated by studies like CIRA and the Risky Business Project, the work reviews US economic impacts and adaptation across sectors. It excludes independent studies, focusing on CIRA/Risky Business outputs. Adaptation is categorized as anticipatory, autonomous, or planned, with residual impacts determined by cost-effectiveness choices, technological limits, and implementation. Studies informing adaptation and mitigation planners need to be differentiated, requiring estimations of both inaction risks and adaptation effects. Literature is limited on impacts to manufacturing, mining, tourism, finance, insurance, non-market values, and secondary effects. Business-as-usual adaptation scenarios are considered, with impacts appearing modest in the US context, potentially due to carbon fertilization assumptions.

It links climate models (GCMs) to biogeochemical models (TEM, Century, BBGC, BIOME3) to project changes in ecosystem productivity (NPP, biomass) at a 0.5 x 0.5 degree grid scale. These productivity changes are then used to modify growth coefficients within forest sector models, specifically the RPA Timber Assessment model (using ATLAS growth and yield functions from multiple assessments), FASOM (Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model), and CGTM (Computable General Trade Model) - some with intertemporal optimization. Analyses examine impacts on forest productivity, diversity, timber supply/demand, prices, welfare, and land-use shifts between agriculture and forestry under different climate scenarios and economic assumptions (intensive/extensive margins). Net present value is measured using a 5% discount rate. The approach projects outcomes over various time horizons (e.g., 1991-2065, 1990-2100, 100-year projections).","Climate change impacts forest productivity and the forest sector, but the sector is remarkably adaptable. Early models assumed linear productivity changes, while later assessments use transient climate scenarios. Elevated carbon dioxide alongside climate change generally leads to greater forest growth and inventory increases, impacting timber markets. While net primary production may expand globally, affecting timber-producing regions and benefiting consumers, regional impacts vary considerably. Trade in forest products significantly influences regional gains or losses. Globally, economic welfare generally increases, although some regions (e.g., North America, former Soviet Union) may experience losses despite increased forest productivity. Higher growth leads to lower log prices, increased consumption, and improved overall economic welfare, with net market surplus expected to increase. The temporal dynamics of climate change, global trade, regional responses, and integrated ecological-economic evaluations are crucial considerations.","The material discusses the assessment of climate change impacts on the forestry sector, including methodologies and models like ATLAS and FASOM, focusing on changes in timber inventories, harvests, and prices without directly linking these to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal impacts. Climate scenarios referenced are GISS, GFDL-1, GFDL-Q, OSU, and UKMO, with analyses potentially requiring updates due to older data. Timber volume/value changes are represented by 'delta' values, though interpretations are vague. Trade dampens climate change effects in forest product markets, while uncertainty in economic models rivals that in climate models. Welfare changes are dissected into intensive and extensive margins, suggesting detailed analysis, but the focus remains narrowly on forestry, risking oversight of broader economic effects or cross-sector interactions.

Indirect climate change-related risks are implicated. Management strategies include trapping, sterile insect technique (SIT), orchard management, destruction of fallen fruit, and biocontrol; trapping effectiveness is enhanced when combined with SIT. Increased trap density lowers eradication costs but raises survey costs; sterile male release can allow for lower trap densities. A pest-free area can generate substantial export revenue (e.g., US $10.3 million in citrus exports to the US) and jobs (e.g., 2000 jobs valued at US $3.2 million per year). Accurate diagnostics are critical. Eradication campaigns can be successful (e.g., B. papayae in Australia), but presence of pests can lead to market access restrictions. Quarantine can be both biologically necessary and protectionist.","Several pages discuss invasive fruit flies (various species) and their control. Key themes include: the potential ecological and economic damage from these pests, the need for extensive and intensive control strategies (including data sharing, trapping, sterile male releases, pesticides, quarantine, and crop sanitation), the trade-offs between detection/eradication costs, and the potential for errors in species identification to have economic consequences. Some examples are geographically specific (e.g., Okinawa, Cook Islands, Florida, Gazelle Peninsular, Taiwan). The relevance of these themes to a global review of macroeconomic/macro-fiscal risks of climate change and adaptation costs/benefits depends on whether climate change is driving pest infestations with significant national-level economic impacts, and whether sub-national analyses or case studies are included in the review's scope.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"Agriculture, specifically fruit production, is impacted by fruit fly infestations.","The provided notes focus heavily on modeling and managing fruit fly infestations and eradication campaigns.

Scenarios of sea-level rise impact are analyzed using illustrative diagrams. Islands are classified by land use and function (initially eight types, later grouped into four classes), then analyzed considering engineering design conditions, space and material availability, cost-benefit, social acceptability, and economic productivity. Analysis includes mitigation and non-mitigation SLR scenarios, overtopping and inundation, and considers policy, human, physical, engineering, and economic/financial challenges. The approach is specific to island needs and consistent with present development policies.","Highlights: Structural adaptation like land claim and island raising can sustain atoll nations despite sea-level rise (SLR), averting forced migration, and allowing alignment with development for continued prosperity, especially in tourist islands where it's financially viable when timed with lease ends. While natural atolls can adapt to minimal SLR via sediment deposition, protected atolls are more vulnerable and require costly artificial intervention. Raising land guarantees flood prevention, enabling a managed relocation strategy to raised islands. Strategic island raising, integrated with development, can address adaptation challenges in urban areas like 'Greater Mal√©'. Successful adaptation requires integrated top-down and bottom-up approaches, ensures freshwater availability, and employs innovative funding mechanisms (e.g., levies, increased land prices), applied across various time scales.","The material explores differential adaptation strategies to sea-level rise (SLR) in atoll nations like the Maldives, focusing on urban islands (land claim, island raising) versus tourist islands (soft engineering). Migration between islands is considered a key adaptation mechanism in response to SLR and infrastructure abandonment. Human intervention is highlighted as crucial for maintaining land levels in protected atolls. The specific timing of adaptation measures, such as raising islands, depends on factors like future emissions, climate sensitivity, and population growth. The adaptation strategy aims for flexibility and development alongside livelihood improvements.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"The tourism sector and sectors reliant on land use and infrastructure, especially in coastal regions and island nations like the Maldives, are significantly impacted by sea-level rise and related climate change effects.","Benefits of adaptation are quantified using cost-benefit analysis of adaptation pathways, considering factors such as engineering design conditions, space and material availability, social acceptability, and economic productivity in relation to land use and island function.

It utilizes a panel dataset of up to 60 countries covering the period 1960-2006, with some analysis extended to 2014 based on data availability. TFP data is primarily sourced from the Penn World Table (PWT 8.1, RTFPNA series). The methodology involves first-differencing temperature and precipitation data, as well as using the natural logarithm of the RTFPNA index.

Robustness checks include sensitivity tests, alternative regression specifications, and interaction terms with dummy variables for poor and hot countries, average temperature, and GDP per capita. Non-linear temperature effects are explored by categorizing temperature changes into quartiles (cold, mild, warm, hot). Both annual TFP growth and annual labor productivity growth are used as dependent variables. Projections of future warming are used to predict the impact on TFP growth based on estimated short-run semi-elasticities.

Focusing on Total Factor Productivity (TFP) as a measure of economic activity rather than GDP growth, the research demonstrates the persistence of weather impacts, linking temperature effects to labour productivity in poorer nations. Analysis reveals a negative impact of temperature on TFP growth, which diminishes with increasing income. Heterogeneous effects are explored using interactions between temperature changes, GDP per capita, institutional quality, and a 'hot' country dummy. The study uses projected warming data (RCP 8.5) for 2071-2095.

Instead, it focuses on analyzing the effect of changes in observed weather and climate distributions on economic outcomes using econometric methods, including raw annual data, filtered data (Baxter-King band-pass filter), long differences, and cross-sectional approaches. The paper also estimates the effect of climate change by evaluating the impact of changes in historical climate.","Methodologies for assessing the macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks of climate change and the costs and benefits of adaptation include time-series, panel data, long-difference, and cross-sectional regression analyses with fixed effects and time trends. The marginal treatment comparability assumption is considered, and various temporal frequencies of data (unfiltered to long differences) are used to test its validity and address omitted variable bias. Frequency domain analysis using Fourier series and Baxter-King band-pass filters is employed to decompose climate and outcome data. The Envelope Theorem and Gradient Theorem are used to recover total climate effects using weather variation. Nonlinear models (e.g., Q-order polynomials) are used to evaluate aggregated outcomes and localized climate effects. Interaction terms in panel data models capture how climate effects vary with average climatic conditions. Distributed lag models analyze the impact of climate events over time. Climate econometric studies utilize physical quantities as regressors, facilitating cross-context comparisons and meta-analysis (random-effects framework) to synthesize generalizable findings. A partial equilibrium approach estimates the alteration of an outcome due to changes in historical climate:  /DeltaŒæYÀÜt= fÀÜ(Ct + /DeltaŒæCt) ‚àí fÀÜ(Ct). Both top-down (aggregate proxies) and bottom-up (sectoral summation) estimates are utilized, accounting for covariance across sectors. Replication and synthesis of econometric findings strengthen credibility in applying results to simulations.","Long-differences may provide more plausible assumptions for marginal treatment comparability in climate studies, though they still pose challenges due to tensions with unit homogeneity. The 'frequency-identification trade-off' highlights challenges in maintaining credible identification, particularly with low-frequency climate variation, where belief effects are significant. Similar temperature effects on maize yields are seen across time-scales, except for cross-sectional, where belief effects and omitted variables may play roles. Local adaptation allows for identical marginal effects of climate and weather, but caution is needed, as outcomes hinge on belief and adaptation. Climate modeling underscores the significance of non-linear effects and temporal displacement, where events preempt outcomes. Comparisons across contexts enhance reproducibility but require cautious methodology due to unverifiable counterfactuals and potential adaptation influences. Understanding climate policy requires grasping its full economic impact and adaptation costs, which are rarely measured. Major methodological advances are needed for adaptation costs, general equilibrium, unprecedented events, and integration with policy models. Larger and heterogeneous regions suggest smoother climate response, necessitating interaction modeling between climate conditions and variables.","The analysis addresses econometric challenges in estimating climate change impacts, focusing on identification strategies rather than adaptation measures. Key considerations include accounting for unobservable differences to reduce omitted variable bias, utilizing high-frequency time series for identifying climate effects if belief effects manifest as adaptations to direct impacts, and acknowledging the limitations of identifying lagged effects due to overlapping climatic histories. The methodology is demonstrated using maize yields, with an assumption of marginal treatment comparability for shorter timescales. Aggregation of heterogeneous temperatures based on the distribution of units of analysis leads to smoother aggregate response to climate measures. Identifying causal relationships in adaptation studies is challenging due to endogeneity and omitted variables, necessitating the use of plausibly exogenous circumstances. Bottom-up estimates may better account for the distributional costs of climate change, and general equilibrium changes will impact prices.

In 2022, the region suffered economic losses from extreme weather amounting to US$15.6 billion, or 0.28% of GDP. These losses exacerbate health challenges, as climate changes increase heat-related mortality and disease risk, notably for vulnerable populations. The region's energy mix still heavily relies on coal, with renewable sources remaining underutilized, despite growing investments in clean energy. Climate change impairs infrastructure and renewable energy production, enhancing reliance on fossil fuels and inflating healthcare and economic costs. The agriculture sector's CO2e emissions are driven by high animal product consumption and deforestation. Air quality deteriorates due to fossil fuel reliance, with economic losses also stemming from heat-reduced labor capacity. Policies are urged to enhance climate resilience, prioritize healthy energy transitions, and bolster climate finance. Meanwhile, media awareness about climate and health issues is rising. Despite these challenges, transitioning to zero-emission energy and food systems is potentially economically beneficial.","Latin America faces weak adaptation policies and scarce, politically-dependent climate finance, necessitating robust vulnerability and adaptation assessments.

It also examines the effects of temperature shocks using evidence from the last half century, and employs distributed lag models to analyze temporal effects.","The study employs global panel data analysis from 1979-2016, focusing on dry spells, heat waves, and drought impacts on agricultural outcomes (FAO CPI growth rate, crop production, and GDP). Methodology includes:

*   **Data:** Climate Prediction Center (CPC) daily precipitation data gridded to 0.5 degrees latitude and longitude to calculate dry spell days. Data covers 118 countries (excluding Sub-Saharan Africa).
*   **Econometric Approach:** Primarily uses linear regression models with country and year fixed effects. Models also include distributed lag models (up to 5 years), split-sample regressions, and interaction terms. A sequential g-estimation is also employed.
*   **Key Variables:** Dry spell exposure anomalies, heat wave days, 12-month SPEI to identify water deficits and drought, annual precipitation, aridity index, lagged agricultural value added per capita.
*   **Controls/Adjustments:** Climate regimes, trends, droughts, potential effects of irrigation, water deficits, aridity, temperature bins, polynomial precipitation and temperature terms, linear and cubic country trends, lagged environmental variables and value added.
*   **Heterogeneity Analysis:** Subsample analysis and interaction terms are used to assess heterogeneous effects based on country-level aridity, drought (SPEI), and irrigation.
*   **Robustness:** Panel bootstrap with 1000 replicates for correlations, clustering standard errors at the country level.

The analysis isolates the effects of dry spells beyond overall rainfall, accounting for other stressors and considering multi-timescale impacts. The paper examines the persistence of dry spell effects using distributed lag models.","The analysis highlights the significant negative impacts of dry spells on crop production growth and food price indices, with effects compounded by droughts, aridity, and prolonged heatwaves. Dry spells particularly harm regions with water deficits (SPEI ‚â§ 0) and high aridity (Aridity Index ‚â§ 0.65). Irrigation can mitigate these effects. Heat waves alone also negatively impact growth in crop yields and FAO CPI, with a non-linear relationship between temperature and economic output. Although joint exposure to dry spells and heatwaves shows variable negative impacts, longer heatwave durations exacerbate the damage. The adverse effects of dry spells persist and are statistically significant, particularly in agricultural sectors. Overall, water stress from climate events such as dry spells and heatwaves presents notable macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks, underscoring the need for adaptation measures at national levels.","The study investigates the impact of dry spells and heat waves on crop production, employing panel data analysis leveraging both between- and within-country variation. It uses dry spell days of varying lengths (7-35 days) and controls for temperature, precipitation (both linear and quadratic terms), and country-specific time trends. Production consequences are isolated using fixed international prices to weight crop production. The analysis explores irrigation as a moderator of dry spell effects and addresses potential endogeneity concerns regarding drought using sequential g-estimation. The interaction of dry spells and heat waves (both simultaneous and co-located) is examined, with robustness checks conducted using different model specifications. The impact heterogeneity based on heat wave exposure (varying duration) is also explored. Variables representing temperature, temperature squared, precipitation, and precipitation squared are used as controls. Results suggest that irrigation may facilitate adaptation to dry spells. While some results might be sensitive to model specification, the core findings on the impact of dry spells are generally consistent.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,Econometric,Acute shocks,Adaptive,Global,Sequential Interactions,Transitional (accounting for changes over time),,"The analysis accounts for irrigation by modifying specifications to mitigate its effects on crop choice and productivity. It also examines subsamples varying with background water stress, explores interactions with drought and aridity, and tests for the effect of irrigation.

It links temperature to urbanization rates and formulates hypotheses on their relationship. The dataset requires a fully balanced structure and averages weather data to correct for grid and elevation disparities. Cross-sectional dependence is assessed using Pesaran et al. (2008) and Pesaran (2015) tests. Unit root tests by Pesaran (2007), Herwartz and Siedenburg (2008), and Demetrescu and Hanck (2012) assess urbanization and temperature data, robust against cross-sectional dependence, serial correlation, and heteroskedasticity.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating rural vulnerabilities to global warming are crucial to manage the potentially dangerous consequences of climate-induced urbanization.","The study investigates the relationship between global warming and urbanization, particularly focusing on agriculture and public goods provision as mediating channels. Warming contributes to agricultural productivity losses and pro-urban shifts in public goods provision, driving rural-urban migration, especially in countries with economic and institutional underdevelopment and strong agricultural dependence. However, temperature increases can also disincentivize migration by raising costs and worsening liquidity constraints, with long-run effects potentially being more pronounced. The analysis uses econometric methods to account for cross-sectional dependence, non-stationarity, and cointegration, employing various measures of temperature and urbanization for robustness.

The GRACE model (a global CGE model) is used extensively for assessing economic consequences of climate change. Adaptation is addressed explicitly, implicitly, or autonomously in IAMs, but often lacks granularity.

Several approaches are used to model adaptation, including: top-down (CGE models) and bottom-up integration, impact models for translating climate conditions into variables of interest, response surface approaches, global sensitivity analysis (GSA) for model evaluation, stress-testing and counterfactual simulations ('with' vs 'without' adaptation'), robust decision-making frameworks, and expert elicitation. Specific tools include: dynamic flood risk modelling, socio-hydrological models (integrating qualitative and quantitative data), Land System Modular Model (LandSyMM) for land use and food systems, weather index insurance (WII) models, and hybrid top-down and bottom-up climate vulnerability assessments. Downscaled GCM projections, statistical downscaling, and perturbation of local time series are used to incorporate climate change signals. Methodologies also emphasize stakeholder engagement, participatory development of impact chains, and multi-criteria analysis (MCA) with uncertainty analysis (UA). The IPCC Risk Framework (R = f(H, E, V)) is operationalized. Addressing model transparency, model validation, and the integration of micro-level insights into macro-level models are also discussed. The importance of interdisciplinary research is also highlighted.","The EU adaptation strategy is shifting towards implementation and informed decision-making, emphasizing adaptation modelling. IAMs are used for economic assessments but often lack local and sectoral detail. Without mitigation, adaptation costs are high. Adaptation can mitigate negative impacts in sectors like forestry and worker productivity, though micro-assessments may reveal greater vulnerability than macroeconomic assessments suggest. Top-down and bottom-up adaptation approaches are complementary. Research is needed on proactive adaptation under uncertainty and the economic costs of climate impacts. Model validation requires more than historical data; global sensitivity analysis is useful. Global climate scenarios are relevant for long-term coastal defence planning, while local factors dominate in the short-to-mid term. Robust decision-making frameworks are crucial under uncertainty, emphasizing collaborative, participatory, and iterative processes focusing on resilience. Deep uncertainty is not an impediment to adaptation if decision-led frameworks are used. The Ensemble Outcome Agreement (EOA) index helps prioritize adaptation options. Challenges include representing climate uncertainty, quantifying nature-based solution effects, and considering dynamic interactions. Impact models can represent sensitivity, urgency, and response to climate change. The IRS method is a novel approach for estimating risks but has limited demonstrated applications. Adaptation strategies in agriculture include new varieties and diversified crops. Effective flood risk management requires consideration of human-flood system dynamics and vulnerability reduction. Urban climate services support evidence-based urban policies. Risk sharing, including weather-based insurance, is vital in agriculture, though forecast accuracy affects insurance uptake. Global flood models have accuracy limitations. Land use and food system adaptation, assessed by models like LandSyMM, involves trade-offs between environmental synergies and externalities. Adaptation measures should integrate economic efficiency, social acceptability, environmental sustainability, and robustness. Adaptation investments can yield high economic returns. Spatial network vulnerabilities need prioritization for systemic resilience. Decision-making should prioritize robustness under deep uncertainty. Addressing techno-institutional lock-in and fostering science-policy synergies is crucial for water policy. Harmonized methodologies are needed for GHG emissions accounting and risk disclosure. Transition risks necessitate improved assessment and reporting. The protection gap for business interruption risks needs addressing, with insurance playing a role in proactive risk management and creditworthiness. Climate change impacts mortgage delinquency rates. Data sharing between public and private stakeholders is crucial for insurable risks. Current models often lack the spatial-temporal resolution required for local adaptation decisions and fail to disentangle uncertainty sources, underscoring the need to integrate top-down modelling with local experience. Impact chains can reveal missed vulnerability and exposure factors. Scenario development and participatory qualitative scenarios are vital for understanding future problems and opportunities and integrating multiple points of view.","The document addresses the gap between adaptation science/modeling and policy. It emphasizes smarter adaptation through data, nature-based solutions, and fiscal policies. Key themes include advancing adaptation modeling and risk assessment, promoting rapid response solutions for decision-makers, and developing tools for adaptation practitioners. Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are examined, noting issues in distinguishing direct damages from adaptation costs, variations in adaptive capacity across scenarios, and blending adaptation modeling with geoengineering. Limitations of IAMs and CGE models are highlighted, including market-related barriers, weak empirical foundations at the national level, and inadequate representation of extreme events. The importance of model validation, sensitivity analysis, and incorporating uncertainty is stressed. Specific methodologies and applications are discussed in later chapters. The document explores adaptation in various sectors (agriculture, water resources, transport, private sector, insurance), scales (local, regional, global), and contexts (EU Adaptation Strategy, European Green Deal). Diversification of crop rotations and the development of process-based flood risk modeling are recommended. The role of the private sector, transparency in GHG emissions accounting, and the potential of insurance in transferring risk are explored. The integration of modeling outputs with qualitative knowledge for decision-making under uncertainty is emphasized, as is the importance of accounting for technical/physical feasibility, local capacities, governance, and preferences to define adaptation limits.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,,Acute shocks,Adaptive,Global,Sectoral Interactions,Adaptive (reflecting shifts in economic behavior in response to impacts),Other,"Adaptation is analyzed through Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), including CGE and PE models, although often lacking granularity.

Analysis is conducted for all states and regional groupings (ER, SWR, NCR, NWR). Remote sensing data assessment, exposure analysis, and statistical data analysis are used. The study further involves intra-country analysis of floods and droughts.","Floods and droughts in India have differing impacts: droughts have a more significant sub-national economic impact despite floods exposing larger areas. Sub-national analysis is crucial given investments in mitigation and adaptation. While floods can cause localized destruction, they also contribute to groundwater recharge, benefiting certain regions (e.g., NWR, leading to positive GSDP impacts). However, floods generally negatively impact HDI, except in the NWR. Droughts generally negatively impact GSDP and HDI, significantly affecting the non-agriculture sector, and agriculture specifically in the NCR, indicating adaptation shortfalls. Eastern states face high flood exposure and low GSDP, necessitating mitigation and adaptation investments. Southern, western, and central states face extensive drought exposure. Flood mitigation investments show significant impact, especially in the ER and SWR. Diversification of economic activities is needed in SWR states. Floods in the NWR have a positive influence on non-agriculture GDP, while lagged drought exposure negatively influences non-agriculture GDP in the ER.","This study assesses the sub-national (state-level) economic impacts of floods and droughts in India, considering regional differences in geography, hydrogeology, and GSDP (grouped into ER, SWR, NCR, NWR). Using Flood-Exposed Area (FLEA), Drought-Exposed Area (DREA), and GSDP data for specific flood (2003, 2010, 2013) and drought years, the analysis reveals that the relationship between exposure and GSDP varies regionally. While GSDPs in non-agriculture sectors are generally positively impacted by floods and negatively by droughts, no significant overall influence on HDI was found, although increased groundwater recharge from floods in the NWR may explain positive impacts on HDI and investments in flood mitigation may have had secondary impacts on water supply, sanitation, and education. Adaptation actions in the non-agriculture sector may explain the SWR results. The study highlights the importance of groundwater recharge from floods and calls for boosted investments in regionally tailored flood and drought mitigation and adaptation strategies, particularly focusing on finer spatial resolutions (district or sub-district level) due to intra-state variations that confound the results and the weakness of instrumental variables.

It uses temporal exposure to temperature intervals to capture non-linear responses. The models distinguish between short- and long-run effects, controlling for factors like country fixed effects, other economic variables (e.g., GDP), and proxies for capital stock adjustments. Future energy demand is projected by combining estimated elasticities with ESM temperature projections (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios) and SSP socioeconomic scenarios. Aggregation of meteorological data across spatial and temporal scales is considered. Sensitivity analysis is performed on parameter estimates and modeling approaches to assess uncertainty, including examining the impact of different capital proxies, and focusing on the year 2050. The analysis considers heterogeneity in demand response across sectors, fuels, and regions and examines the spatial distribution of future changes in energy demand.","Climate change is expected to increase global energy demand, particularly in tropical regions, though this effect is secondary to economic expansion. Impacts are geographically uneven and disproportionately affect low- and middle-income countries, leading to a regressive redistribution of energy consumption towards tropical regions and summer months. The effect on energy demand varies across sectors (industry, residential, agriculture), regions (South America, Asia, Africa see increases; Europe, North America, Oceania mixed responses), and energy sources. Uncertainty in income and temperature responses leads to wide ranges in projected energy demand increases. Dynamic modeling is crucial for accurate projections, as static models produce different elasticity estimates. Short-run responses underestimate long-run effects, which are tied to adjustments in capital stock (quantity and energy efficiency). Extreme temperatures and humidity have significant short- and long-run impacts on GDP per capita, varying by region and sector, with fuel choices also influencing GDP. While economic expansion significantly increases energy demand in the tropics, climate change adds to this.","The paper examines the complex relationships between climate change, particularly temperature variations, and energy demand across various global regions and sectors. It underscores significant projected increases in energy demand in South America, Asia, and Africa, and presents mixed responses in Europe, North America, and Oceania. The analysis focuses on three primary energy commodities‚Äîelectricity, fuel oil, and natural gas‚Äîacross four economic sectors: residential, commercial, industrial, and agriculture. The study highlights the nonlinear nature of energy demand sensitivity to meteorological variables, emphasizing that relative humidity better represents cooling demands, while specific humidity is used to reduce correlation with temperature. 

The research suggests that future energy systems will significantly differ from current consumption patterns, potentially affecting GDP through changes in energy costs and availability. Findings indicate a shift towards electricity in the 2050 energy mix, with tropical countries adjusting more swiftly to weather shocks than their temperate counterparts. Long-term energy demand responses to temperature change are more pronounced than short-term effects.

Regional disparities are evident, with tropical areas anticipating more significant energy demands, which may imply broader macroeconomic impacts. The analysis differentiates the energy demand impacts across different sectors, masking heterogeneity that aggregate analyses often overlook. Data limitations mean that detailed sectoral breakdowns do not directly translate changes in energy demand into economic output or fiscal consequences, yet these impacts can be inferred.

Regression analyses isolate temperature and natural gas impacts on economic output, revealing non-additive uncertainties in GDP and temperature response effects. Proxy measures like real per capita GDP and aggregate capital stock provide insights into capital adjustments affecting energy-intense durables.

The analysis primarily relies on historical data, simulation, and statistical modeling without specifying particular socioeconomic or climate scenarios.","The study employs a mixed-methods approach to analyze the natural catastrophe protection gap and property insurance demand. Methodologies include: analysis of historical loss data from sources like Swiss Re, Oxford Economics, and the World Bank; probabilistic modelling using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate expected losses and generate hazard maps; regression analysis on a panel dataset of 51-53 countries from 2000-2015 (using log-log, log-linear, and random effects models); cross-sectional data analysis to estimate GDP elasticity of premium volumes and a 'best-practice benchmark' for insurance penetration (using a logistic model); analysis of trends in uninsured losses as a percentage of GDP (using time series analysis, often averaged over ten-year periods); calculation of protection gaps by subtracting insured losses from economic losses; correlation analysis; and descriptive statistics and graphical representations (scatter plots, bar charts) to visualize relationships between variables like insurance penetration, economic development, and natural disaster losses. Guy Carpenter's cat price indices are used as a proxy for property insurance prices. The analysis also involves categorizing underinsurance types, and comparing countries and economies. The study uses GDP and consumption per capita for extrapolation and benchmarking of insurance penetration.","There is a significant global protection gap for climate-related and other natural catastrophes, with substantial uninsured losses, especially in emerging economies. Economic development affects insurance demand, yet a disparity between insured and uninsured losses remains, primarily in countries like the US, Japan, and China. Factors like internet access can increase insurance uptake, while issues like political risk and Islamic law can hinder it. Emerging markets show an increasing uninsured loss trend that outpaces GDP growth. Middle-income economies face the highest underinsurance relative to GDP, and despite economic growth, insurance penetration often lags, acting as a substitute for savings. Enhancements in building codes and mandatory insurance schemes can help address underinsurance by narrowing the gap and supporting economic recovery after disasters. The correlation between mortgage penetration and insurance uptake reinforces this. Digital distribution channels can also aid in expanding access. Overall, the gap between actual and best-practice insurance penetration signals a critical underinsurance issue, with potential solutions involving policy mandates and integrating insurance with essential services to reduce fiscal vulnerability and promote recovery.","The study analyzes the property insurance protection gap (uninsured losses) and underinsurance (difference between economically beneficial and actual insurance) using a cross-country panel dataset covering 90% of global GDP. Swiss Re sigma data on disaster losses (threshold of USD 48.8M insured or USD 97.7M total) is used, acknowledging the influence of large earthquakes in the 1970s/80s on emerging market data. The analysis focuses on property damage, estimating value at risk akin to property underwriter models. A USD 153 billion gap estimate may be biased, overestimating by including some self-insured assets, but underestimating by omitting perils like hail and drought. Risk perceptions, buying behavior, and market structure contribute to underinsurance; a 'best-practice benchmark' is derived from top quartile insurance penetration. Analysis controls for inflation/exchange rates by normalizing premiums by GDP. Factors influencing insurance penetration (a proxy for resilience) including financial, demographic, and digital distribution aspects are explored, while noting availability bias in risk perception. Underinsurance types (entirely uninsured, perils not covered, restrictive terms, undervalued) are identified with corresponding strategies. Insurance industry and governments are pivotal through standards and mitigation incentives. Product bundling, simple policies, and trust improve penetration. Index-based insurance and takaful can address underinsurance, requiring strong regulation and Sharia-compliant assets for takaful's success.

The paper assesses these impacts by modeling future insured losses under different climate scenarios, highlighting potential macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks for this sector.","Benefits of adaptation are quantified by comparing simulated insured losses under current climatic conditions versus future climate scenarios (e.g., 2050 with RCP 4.5), both with and without adaptation measures. The difference in projected losses represents the avoided damages (and thus the benefits) attributable to adaptation. This involves stochastic modeling, climate projections, hazard and vulnerability models, and extrapolation of historical data to estimate insured losses from floods and storm surges.","Costs of adaptation are quantified by simulating future insured losses from climate-related disasters (flood, storm surge) under different climate scenarios (RCP 4.5). This involves using climate model outputs (ARPEGE-Climate) to generate stochastic weather events, hazard and damage models, and projections of insured property values. The analysis assesses the variation of mean annual insured losses based on these simulations, providing a distribution of potential losses.","The analysis relies primarily on ex-ante modeling. It uses climate simulations and hazard/vulnerability models to project future insured losses under different climate scenarios, rather than analyzing historical events. Although historical data is used for calibration and extrapolation of insured values, the core of the analysis is forward-looking simulation.","The provided text focuses on the *modeling* of climate-related risks (floods, storm surge, drought) and the estimation of potential insured losses under different climate scenarios (specifically RCP 4.5 projecting to 2050). It details the use of climate models (ARPEGE-Climate), hazard and vulnerability models, and historical insurance data to simulate future losses. The process involves creating probabilistic hazard maps, considering sea level rise, and projecting insured property values. The analysis ultimately aims to assess the variation of mean annual insurance losses under different climate scenarios. However, the text does *not* explicitly discuss the adaptation planning or decision-making processes themselves. It describes the *inputs* to such processes (i.e., risk assessment and loss estimation), but not how those inputs are used to formulate adaptation plans or make adaptation decisions.",,"The understanding of ""sufficient adaptation levels"" in the reviewed paper involves assessing adaptation through the lens of economic resilience, particularly focusing on insurance losses due to climatic hazards. Sufficient adaptation is implicitly defined by the capacity to manage and mitigate future insured losses from climate-related events like floods and storm surges. By using climate simulations and historical insurance data, the paper outlines an approach where adaptation means reducing vulnerability and economic losses under projected future climate conditions. This involves the use of probabilistic hazard maps and demographic projections to anticipate changes in insured values, suggesting that being well-adapted is characterized by minimized insured losses and enhanced preparedness against extreme weather events caused by climate change.","Cannot answer based on the provided extracts.

Baseline and projected runoff values are used to create storage-yield curves for numerous basins, estimating changes in yields and required storage. Adaptation is modeled as increased storage or an alternative up to $1/m3 of lost yield. Economic impacts are estimated based on costs incurred to maintain historical yields in basins with decreasing yields, and economic benefits from increased yields in water-scarce basins.

Adaptation to climate change by the 2050s is estimated to cost $15 billion annually, with potential benefits in South Asia and costs in Latin America/Caribbean, linked to runoff changes. The study focuses on the robustness of projected river runoff, irrigation water needs, and basin storage yield, and their associated costs, assessing adaptation within basin-scale water supply systems, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America/Caribbean, the Middle East/North Africa, and Central/South Asia. Economic benefits may occur in basins with existing water deficits if yields decline and adaptation responses like storage are implemented.","This study examines the economic impact of climate change on water resources at the basin level, focusing on changes in basin yields and associated adaptation costs/benefits. It uses storage yield curves to assess the impact on water yield given fixed storage and the changes in storage needed to maintain fixed yield. Precipitation is identified as the main driver of river runoff, irrigation water requirements, and storage yield. While temperature effects can induce costs even with no precipitation changes, some basins (e.g., Zambezi, Volta, and Niger) are projected to benefit from precipitation changes. Agreement across GCM ensembles supports the robustness of irrigation water requirement projections and confidence in the direction of water availability changes.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"The water resources sector is directly and significantly impacted. The paper focuses on climate change effects on water availability, river runoff, and basin yields, and assesses the economic costs and benefits of adaptation measures related to water storage and scarcity.","The benefits of adaptation in this context are quantified as the avoided costs (or realized gains) associated with maintaining historical water yields in river basins facing decreased water availability due to climate change. This is done by comparing the cost of adaptation measures, such as increased storage or alternative water sources, to the economic benefits derived from maintaining water supply in basins where water is scarce.

It explores adaptation strategies like increased water storage or alternative water sources to compensate for yield losses due to climate change, using a cost threshold of $1/m^3 of lost yield as a decision point. The planning process emphasizes probabilistic climate projections and the economic evaluation of adaptation costs and benefits at basin and regional scales.",,"The paper defines sufficient adaptation in the context of water resources as maintaining historical basin yields despite climate change impacts. This is achieved through storage increases or alternative solutions, up to a cost threshold of $1/m^3 of lost yield. If adaptation measures can maintain historical yields at or below this cost, the basin is considered well-adapted.","The benefit of ""soft options"" in climate change adaptation includes enhancing adaptive capacity through improved information dissemination, increasing awareness and engagement among stakeholders, and developing institutions capable of implementing effective policy responses. These interventions can leverage existing infrastructure, reduce reliance on costly physical adaptations, and enable more flexible and sustainable management of resources. By improving decision-making processes and policy implementation, they can enhance resilience to climate-related risks at lower costs compared to purely structural solutions."

A baseline scenario is established using existing projections and correlations. Regression models, chosen for their fit and significance, assess the impact of climate and socioeconomic factors on cholera incidence. Reactive adaptation costs and productivity losses are calculated, with cost estimates adjusted for Tanzania's GDP. Analyses incorporate seasonality through dummy variables and use both annual and monthly datasets to project future boundaries of risk. Long-term datasets and unpublished data inform cost estimates, while the adaptation costs in the health sector consider future economic development and health system strengthening. Econometric analyses include negative binomial regression models to describe the relationship between cholera deaths and influencing factors, utilizing datasets on income and water coverage.","Climate change is projected to significantly increase the burden of cholera in Tanzania, potentially costing between 0.32% and 1.4% of GDP by 2030. A 2¬∞C temperature increase could lead to substantial increases in cholera cases and deaths, with the majority (90%) of costs attributed to loss of life. The study estimates additional costs from reactive adaptation measures and productivity losses due to climate change induced cholera, and highlights the positive correlation between temperature and cholera cases. Implementing adaptation measures that limit temperature increase could yield cost reductions of 44-47%. The cost estimates exceed current diarrheal disease budgets, underscoring the need for increased budgetary allocation. Socioeconomic development and water cover are negatively correlated with cholera deaths.","A 2011 study focusing on Tanzania examines the economic costs of climate change, specifically cholera incidence, within the health sector. It aims to inform adaptation financing and planning but acknowledges limited econometric reliability due to short datasets. The analysis models cholera costs, considering lost productivity (including caretaking) using agricultural wages as a proxy. Preventive adaptation costs (assumed aligned with national development goals of universal water and sanitation by 2025) are excluded, focusing on reactive adaptation costs and residual impacts. The study acknowledges focusing narrowly on cholera, potentially underestimating overall health costs of climate change by excluding other climate-sensitive diseases. The distributional impacts of adaptation are not considered. The study emphasizes the need for national and local quantification of climate-sensitive disease burdens and refinement of preventative and reactive adaptation cost estimates within the health sector.

It projects future inflation impacts by combining empirically derived response functions with climate model (CMIP-6 ensemble) projections of future temperature, using different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) like SSP585 and SSP126. The analysis focuses on average temperature increases and often considers the exogenous pressure on inflation, assuming no unprecedented adaptation or policy responses and abstracting from macroeconomic interactions. Robustness tests include dynamic panel specifications, Driscoll-Kraay standard errors, and controls for monetary policy. Some analyses incorporate lagged weather variables and downscaling methods (ISIMIP). Spatial aggregation is often performed using population-weighted averages. Future impacts are sometimes averaged over 30-year periods.","Persistent temperature increases affect both food and headline inflation across different income countries, with intensified pressures in low latitudes and seasonal peaks in high latitudes. Impacts of temperature rises are nonlinear and keenly felt in food prices, with climate variability exacerbating these effects. Global warming elevates inflation risks significantly, independent of emission trajectories, though mitigation efforts could alleviate these pressures. Future warming will disrupt traditional seasonal inflation cycles and intensify inflation impacts, with climate extremes potentially increasing inflationary pressures by up to 200% by 2060 under pessimistic scenarios. Climate change is anticipated to heighten inflation volatility and enforce ongoing upward pressure on inflation levels. Inconsistencies in data, such as the inclusion of imputed rents, affect inflation responses. Weather deviations alter month-on-month inflation, with linear trend adjustments clarifying effect sizes. Extreme weather conditions, such as the 2022 European summer heatwave, provide insights into potential future impacts of warming on inflation.","Climate change impacts on inflation are non-linear, varying across seasons, regions, and latitudes, with hotter regions and months experiencing larger effects. Temperature increases at lower latitudes cause upwards inflationary pressures year-round, while at higher latitudes, the effect is seasonal. The magnitude of inflationary pressure from future warming is projected to be greater in the global south. These impacts depend on baseline temperatures and climatic conditions, implying that future climate change will amplify inflation heterogeneity and alter seasonality. While the study also considers precipitation extremes, detecting impacts on food prices is limited by data constraints. Inflationary impacts could be mitigated through adaptation measures like reducing heat stress on labor productivity and crop switching.

The framework includes climate projection (GCMs/RCMs), hazard projection, and impact assessment to evaluate social and economic damages.","Projected climate change in Japan (RCP8.5) indicates increased frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events, driven by thermodynamic and dynamic effects, leading to significantly increased flood risk in major river basins and higher probabilities of exceeding high flood damage costs (e.g., 800 billion JPY). Storm surge severity is expected to increase within 15-35¬∞N, particularly in East Asia, with changes dependent on return periods. Risk and uncertainty premiums associated with flood damage are substantial and unevenly distributed, highlighting their importance in evaluating mitigation policies. Future conditions suggest increased expected loss reductions, risk premiums, and uncertainty premiums, indicating a greater financial burden from coastal hazards. Overall, increased rainfall and typhoons will cause increases in extreme storms, river discharge, coastal surges, and changes to water resources.","Researchers characterize and quantify changes in extreme rainfall events, identifying events from NHRCM05 precipitation output with a threshold of 50 mm/h.

In particular, the study focuses on sectors related to hydrological and meteorological impacts, with detailed analysis on flood and storm surge risks, especially in regions like the Yodo River basin and Osaka Bay in Japan. These climate-related hazards have implications for infrastructure, economic damages, and mitigation policy evaluations.","Benefits of adaptation are quantified by projecting future climate hazards using climate models and statistical analysis of rainfall, wind speeds, and storm surges. These projections are then used to model flood risks and other climate-related damages, allowing for the estimation of economic value of adaptation policies (e.g., dike construction). Risk preferences are also incorporated using surveys.","Costs of adaptation are quantified by using climate projections (GCMs, RCMs, d4PDF, PGW experiments) to assess future climate-related hazards, followed by impact assessments that evaluate social and economic damages and estimate the benefits of specific adaptation measures (e.g., dike rise) in reducing risk (e.g., storm surge flood risk).

Temporal exposure to varying temperature intervals captures non-linear demand responses. Future climate states are projected using Earth System Models (ESMs) under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Grid-cell level changes in energy demand are calculated and aggregated to the country level. The analysis estimates long-run semi-elasticities of per capita final energy consumption to daily temperature exposure. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to assess the impact of parameter uncertainty and different modeling approaches. The methodology focuses on heterogeneity in demand response across sectors, fuels, and regions, and uses both first-differenced and lagged terms in regressions. Capital stock adjustments are sometimes proxied using per capita GDP or other capital-related variables. Robust standard errors are used to account for heteroskedasticity. Projections are made for circa 2050 under various warming scenarios.","Climate change is projected to increase global energy demand, particularly in tropical regions, but the magnitude is generally smaller than the effect of economic expansion. Impacts are regressive, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries. Increases in energy demand are concentrated in developing and industrializing economies in tropical regions, especially in industry and residential sectors, driven by electricity demand. The impact varies significantly across sectors, regions, and energy sources. Uncertainty in income and temperature responses leads to a range of projected increases in energy demand, with significant short-run and long-run impacts of extreme humidity and temperature on real GDP per capita, depending on the sector and region. Long-run adjustments in capital stock (space conditioning, energy efficiency) are crucial. Empirical modeling is used to anticipate challenges projecting climate impacts. Temperature changes and natural gas use have significant impacts on GDP per capita, while long-run fuel oil use has a negative impact. Temperature and humidity's marginal effects depend on capital stock. Climate change leads to a geographic and seasonal redistribution of energy consumption towards tropical regions and summer months. The analysis develops a flexible methodology to characterize geographic variations in climate change impacts on energy demand across the globe, estimating the nonlinear effect of climate on energy use indicative of adaptation responses by final consumers. Dynamic models are necessary, as static models yield different elasticity estimates.","The study examines the relationship between temperature variations and energy demand across sectors (residential, commercial, industrial, agriculture) and fuel types (electricity, fuel oil, natural gas), and its indirect influence on GDP. Geographically, it highlights differences between South America, Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, and Oceania, and particularly focuses on Tropical vs. Temperate regions. The analysis projects increased energy demand in some regions by 2050, with a shift towards electricity. It uses global statistics on energy demand, acknowledging limitations in associating changes with specific end-use services. Methodological limitations include using current energy consumption as a base, assuming uniform per capita energy demand, a deliberately simple theoretical framework, and specific humidity as a proxy for humidity. The study acknowledges the importance of nonlinearity and data aggregation. While it doesn't fully address all macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks or adaptation costs/benefits, it provides a quantitative link between temperature, energy consumption, and GDP. Price-driven energy adjustments might mask some long-run impacts, particularly in temperate regions. Sensitivity analyses focus on the impact of climate and income uncertainty on energy consumption, noting that their effects are not additive. The study uses real per capita GDP as a proxy for capital stock and analyzes sectoral heterogeneity. Results should be interpreted as potential changes, without considering barriers to energy access.

While aggregate national impacts on agriculture may be relatively small due to farmer adaptability and regional diversity, specific crops and localities, particularly those dependent on water availability, will experience more pronounced changes, potentially creating both losses and opportunities for communities.","This study models the impact of climate change on Chilean agriculture and forestry to 2040 and 2070 under SRES A240/A270/B240/B270 scenarios, focusing on land use changes, yields, and revenues. It examines ten fruits, vines, eight field crops, two forestry plantation crops, two pasture categories, alfalfa and fallow land at the municipal level. Adaptation is modeled through land allocation changes, assuming long-run farmer decisions and ceteris paribus. Asset fixity is considered a factor creating inertia. The analysis highlights the impact on specific crops, like rainfed wheat, table grapes (important to national accounts), and avocados, noting potential southward shifts in grape cultivation and mitigation/substitution effects.

The model explores climate damage impacts on both the level and growth rate of economic activity, utilizing RCP/SSP scenarios (primarily RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 with SSP2) and a two-box warming model. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is calculated by comparing welfare outcomes with and without an additional pulse of emissions, converting consumption losses to utility losses, and discounting over the modeling horizon.

Various climate models are used including Hope and Schaefer PCF, Whiteman et al. beta OMH, and IPSL AMOC hosing.","Climate tipping points significantly amplify macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks. They increase the social cost of carbon (SCC) globally, particularly due to ocean methane hydrates and permafrost thaw, though interactions between tipping points can produce offsetting effects, with some (e.g., AMOC slowdown, SAF weakening) potentially decreasing the SCC. Tipping points increase inequality in climate impacts, reduce global mean consumption, and disproportionately affect poorer countries (regressive impacts).

Examples include detailed analysis of flood compartments in East Anglia, England, and studies from the 1990s on Senegal, Benin, and Nigeria based on a 1m sea-level rise. National studies can validate regional models, and coordinated regional efforts within an Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) context are deemed valuable.","Regional cooperation is instrumental in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing climate adaptation strategies. Coastal ecosystems, deltas, small islands, and deltaic regions are notably vulnerable to sea-level rise. Vulnerability assessment is classified into low to critical categories based on impacts such as population risk, capital loss, land loss, and adaptation costs. While comprehensive coastal protection might make sense broadly, localized adaptation strategies, including possible abandonment of certain areas, may be more effective. West Africa, particularly Senegal, Nigeria, and Benin, faces significant threats including land loss, population displacement, and high capital losses. The Pacific Small Islands also show high vulnerability without any beneficiaries, highlighting uniform loss. Enhancing data collection and management is crucial for better vulnerability assessments, and regional perspectives are essential in connecting research with policy development on national and global levels.","Barriers exist to comprehensive climate impact analyses due to knowledge gaps, data scarcity, and scenario development challenges. Research assesses regional vulnerability to sea-level rise and adaptation costs, particularly in Europe. The Netherlands prioritizes shoreline maintenance, though managed retreat is also being considered. Sea-level rise impact estimates are based on 1990s data, with population growth potentially amplifying effects. Protection strategies in Senegal and Nigeria could mitigate impacts, though relocation may be necessary in the Niger Delta. In the near-term, 'no-regret', low-cost anticipatory and 'insurance' adaptation responses are deemed most appropriate.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"Coastal regions and sectors dependent on them are particularly impacted. This includes areas vulnerable to sea-level rise, flooding, storm surges, and wetland loss. Specific sectors like coastal agriculture, fisheries, tourism, and infrastructure are likely to be affected.","Benefits of adaptation are quantified through various methods, including: (1) regional analyses of vulnerability using local and national assessments; (2) global vulnerability analysis (GVA) which assesses the economic impacts of climate change scenarios (e.g., flooding, wetland loss) at national scales then aggregated; (3) economic analysis of protection measures, such as managed retreat, in specific locations; and (4) national studies which are useful for validating regional impact models. These methods often consider factors such as socioeconomic scenarios, sea-level rise, and protection costs.","Adaptation costs are quantified through various methods, including regional vulnerability analyses, global vulnerability analyses aggregated from national scales, and detailed economic analyses of specific interventions like flood protection and managed retreat. These assessments often consider factors like flooding, protection costs, wetland loss, and socio-economic scenarios, leveraging methodologies like the IPCC Common Methodology and tailoring them for specific contexts, such as coastal regions.","The analysis relies primarily on ex-ante modeling, using scenarios and simulations to assess potential future impacts. However, it also incorporates some ex-post observations through case studies and validation efforts using existing data.","The paper discusses adaptation planning/decision-making in the context of assessing vulnerability to sea-level rise, particularly in coastal regions. It mentions the IPCC Common Methodology and technical guidelines, global vulnerability analysis aggregated from national scales, and specific studies evaluating protection measures (e.g., flood compartments, managed retreat) in regions like East Anglia and West Africa.

This is assessed through methods like the IPCC Common Methodology and Global Vulnerability Analysis (GVA), considering socio-economic scenarios and factors like flooding, protection costs, and wetland loss. A ""well-adapted"" state is thus one where these calculated impacts are minimized within feasible economic constraints.

It combines RCPs with economic growth and inequality series from SSPs, adjusting SSP scenarios based on literature. The IFs model incorporates sector-specific factors, household income, consumption, savings, poverty (using a log-normal income distribution), and utilizes the DICE model damage function.

The modelling is macro-level, neglecting micro-level dynamics.","Synopsis: Macro-level climate-driven poverty estimates may underestimate impacts by missing price and consumption dynamics. Climate change poses a significant challenge, potentially pushing tens of millions into poverty and reducing global economic growth across scenarios (-0.2% to -0.6% by 2030, -0.8% to -1.5% by 2050, and -0.8% to -3.2% by 2070). Global inequality is projected to increase due to climate change. By 2070, nearly 40% of those living on less than $1.90/day could be attributable to climate change. GDP losses are projected across all scenarios, reaching substantial amounts (e.g., -$2,340 trillion by 2070 in SSP5-RCP 8.5). Income distribution improvements and balanced socioeconomic development and mitigation efforts can minimize poverty impacts. Scenarios with high adaptation challenges (SSP3 and SSP4) show the highest income inequality and slowest GDP per capita growth, while SSP5 (high growth, high mitigation challenges) sees the fastest GDP per capita growth.","The model examines the trade-off between fossil fuel-dependent economic growth and climate change mitigation, acknowledging potential underestimation of climate change impacts on poverty by omitting micro-level dynamics and other environmental systems.

Leveraging detailed daily weather data, it applies fixed effects regression models incorporating factors such as sunshine duration, rainfall, air pressure, relative humidity, and wind speed. Firm and industry-year fixed effects address potential biases, while standard errors are clustered within firms and prefecture-level city-years to account for spatial and serial correlation. Dynamic panel data methods are used, with robustness checks including varying standard errors and region-year fixed effects. Outputs are further modeled using temperature bins and lagged weather variables to assess longer-term effects on output. The analysis extends to climate adaptation implications, particularly in high-temperature regions, and projects future impacts using Climate-Wizard scenarios, covering 2050s and 2080s under different climate models and warming scenarios.","China's industrial output is influenced by temperature variations, exhibiting nonlinear responses. Output tends to increase with spring temperatures up to 21-24¬∞C, beyond which it declines, especially with temperatures above 30¬∞C, forming an inverted-U shape above 15¬∞C. Higher spring temperatures are beneficial, while elevated summer temperatures have sizable negative impacts, particularly in low-temperature regions. These effects are more pronounced on lower-temperature areas but show the potential for regional adaptation capabilities in high-temperature regions. Future warming, particularly in summer, is projected to significantly decrease industrial output by 3-36% under slow warming (B1) and 12-46% under rapid warming (A2) scenarios. High temperatures affect firm investments negatively and have varied impacts across industries, with food processing and others being notably affected. Value added per worker shows a significant positive response to summer temperatures, highlighting differential adaptation strategies.

The production function approach suggests climate change's net impact on output is underestimated due to unaccounted compensatory farming responses. From the mid-1970s to mid-1980s, agricultural production rose in both SSA and non-SSA countries, with non-SSA growth outpacing SSA. Temperature trends were similar, but SSA experienced a decline in rainfall post-1960s, contrasting with steadier trends in non-SSA countries. Rainfall, while not statistically significant in output determination, significantly affects SSA output due to its variability, whereas temperature increases have a lesser impact. Maintaining pre-1960s climate conditions could have narrowed the production gap between SSA and other developing regions.","The study analyzes the impact of climate change on agricultural production, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), using data from 1901-1998 across 289 countries. It highlights the different nature of agricultural production between SSA and non-SSA developing countries and controls for unobserved country-specific effects. Data availability constrained input choices. SSA shows lower adaptation levels, potentially leading to less bias in estimates compared to a potential downward bias in non-SSA regions. The analysis is limited by controls for input quality and focuses on post-1960 data, particularly after the mid-1970s when SSA agricultural performance declined relative to non-SSA countries. It solely addresses agricultural production, excluding broader macroeconomic or fiscal impacts, and recommends policy interventions like improved irrigation to reduce rainfall sensitivity in African agriculture.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,Econometric,Chronic trends,Adaptive,Regional,None,Static,N/A,"Consideration is given to factors like fertilizer use, agricultural land management, capital investment in tractors, and livestock management as potential mediating factors within the agricultural production function.

The model operates at a spatial resolution of nourishment units and employs market clearing conditions to determine equilibrium prices and investor market share. Methodologies include dynamic programming, hedonic pricing models, coupled physical and economic models, and integrated economic-geological models, applicable to coastal real estate, beach nourishment, shoreline management, and managed retreat strategies.","Highlights: The Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM) simulates the evolution of coastal real estate markets under sea-level rise (SLR), considering factors like property values, resident incomes, and shoreline management. Subsidies and rising external markets can temporarily offset the negative impacts of SLR, but ultimately, property values decline. Cutting nourishment subsidies accelerates this decline, potentially leading to coastal gentrification (demographic shifts). Nourishment decisions are driven by property tax burdens and property value increases, with front-row properties bearing a higher cost share. The model incorporates individual preferences, climate change risk premiums, arbitrage, herding, storm impacts, and property elevation. Key areas of study include tradeoffs between beach nourishment and managed retreat, the impact of repetitive flooding on outmigration and climate gentrification, and the effect of adaptation infrastructure on property values.","The study explores macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks of climate change, focusing on property markets in coastal communities. It highlights a policy tradeoff between managing demographic transitions and ensuring smooth market adjustments to climate risks. The model integrates human and natural systems, analyzing how agent actions influence these interactions. Property values initially obscure risks from interactions of risk, investment, and income. It examines subsidy impacts on coastal nourishment, suggesting rising external markets mitigate subsidy removal effects, while declining markets reduce high-income influx. The fixed housing supply excludes short-term rentals, with destroyed storm structures typically rebuilt. Agents with varied income and climate beliefs affect risk premiums for oceanfront vs. non-oceanfront properties, which aggregate storm and SLR risks without correlational consideration. Oceanfront risk remains fixed, with capital gain expectations shaped by market history. Institutional investors are taxed on nourishment approval but lack voting rights, and the model omits explicit dune building. Climate change foresight factors into risk parameters, and the Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM) is available on GitHub.",Adaptation,,,,,,,,,"The coastal real estate sector is directly impacted by climate change, specifically through sea level rise and changing storm climates.","Benefits of adaptation (specifically beach nourishment in this case) are quantified by simulating property value changes using an agent-based model (C-HOM). This model incorporates factors like sea-level rise, storm risk, beach erosion dynamics, and public finance decisions to determine equilibrium property prices. The change in property values resulting from different adaptation strategies (like different nourishment subsidy rates) are compared against a baseline scenario to estimate the benefits. A user cost framework is used for property valuation, and agents adjust their parameters based on comparisons between coastal property values and external market values.","The Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM) quantifies adaptation costs (specifically related to beach nourishment) by simulating a coastal property market with agents who make decisions based on property values, taxes, and beach width. The model uses a user cost framework for property valuation and simulates housing market dynamics under climate change, accounting for factors like sea level rise, storm risk, and external market influences. Agents vote on adaptation measures (beach nourishment) based on the comparison of property tax burden and property value increase. The results are differences between a baseline scenario without adaptation and scenarios with adaptation measures in place.","The analysis relies on ex-ante modeling, specifically agent-based simulations, to project the effects of sea-level rise and other climate-related factors on coastal property markets.","The paper discusses adaptation planning/decision-making in the context of coastal real estate markets facing sea-level rise (SLR) and storm risk. It focuses on modeling the economic consequences of different policy choices, particularly beach nourishment, and how agents (homeowners, investors) respond to these policies and climate change impacts. The agent-based model simulates agents voting on nourishment plans based on property tax burdens and property value increases. It also includes how agents adjust parameters (income, willingness to pay) based on comparisons between coastal property values and external market values.",,"The paper uses the Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM) to evaluate adaptation levels by simulating coastal property market dynamics under different climate change scenarios, such as sea level rise and storm risks. A sufficient adaptation level in this context means maintaining coastal property value and market equilibrium despite external climate pressures. This includes implementing localized adaptation strategies like beach nourishment and considering external market influences. The model explores how agent preferences, market dynamics, and policy decisions on coastal management collectively determine the resilience and adaptation success of coastal real estate markets. Sufficient adaptation is achieved when policy and market dynamics effectively balance these competing forces to sustain property values over time.","The provided notes do not contain information related to the benefits of ""soft options"" (e.g., informational and institutional interventions) for climate change adaptation.

Panel Vector Autoregression (PVAR) and impulse response functions are utilized to assess the dynamic effects of these rainfall shocks. The scenarios analyzed include regional and local rainfall shocks, considering their impact on agricultural yields, wages, prices, and consumption patterns in India, with data covering various periods between 1967 and 2005.","The study employs econometric methods, notably Panel Vector Autoregression (PVAR), to analyze the macroeconomic and fiscal impacts of rainfall shocks in India, focusing on monsoon variability. Standardized rainfall data at the district level is used, with analysis encompassing spatial and temporal dimensions, including binned scatterplots, LOWESS regression, impulse response functions, and decomposition of shocks. The econometric models utilize fixed effects and error clustering to account for unobserved heterogeneity and outliers. Empirical analysis spans several timeframes (1967‚Äì1991 and 1981‚Äì2005), examining the consequences of rainfall variability on agricultural yields, wages, and prices, while considering irrigation levels. The methodology incorporates quasi-event studies and partial equilibrium analysis, leveraging NSS regional grouping for spatial assessments and consumption pattern investigation across rural populations. The study rigorously tests model robustness against regional/temporal shocks using confidence intervals derived from robust standard errors.","Monsoon rainfall shocks in India have asymmetric effects, with droughts significantly reducing agricultural yield, while excessive rainfall has minimal impact. These negative rainfall shocks lead to persistent declines in agricultural wages and increases in food (rice) prices, lasting for several years. Irrigation mitigates the fall in agricultural wages but not the rise in food prices after regional droughts. The impact of rainfall variations on agricultural yield is most sensitive in June, September, and October. State-level policies, internal migration, and intra-regional food trade can dampen the negative effects of rainfall shocks on wages and prices, but their effectiveness varies depending on the scale of the shock (local vs. regional) and irrigation levels. Negative rainfall shocks negatively affect the welfare of agricultural laborers and cultivators, leading to reduced consumption of staple foods, with laborers experiencing a more persistent decline due to credit constraints. Cultivators are better able to smooth food consumption.","Macroeconomic impacts of regional droughts in India are unevenly distributed. Agricultural laborers are negatively impacted through wage decline and food price increases, while cultivators may benefit in the medium-term. Subsistence farmers are particularly vulnerable. Internal migration patterns are strongly influenced by state borders (NSS region affiliation), while food arbitrage trading is more determined by distance. State-level policies and infrastructure play a key role in agricultural outcomes and can influence food prices and availability. State-year fixed effects, likely reflecting relief programs, significantly influence agricultural yields and food prices following rainfall shocks. Analysis focuses on Kharif rainfall (specific monsoon season) and short-term impacts, with limited data available for Rabi crops affecting the precision of some estimates. The impact on agricultural laborers is exacerbated by their lower income levels and high proportion of income spent on food.",Macroeconomic/Fiscal,Econometric,Acute shocks,Adaptive,Local,Spatial Interactions,Transitional (accounting for changes over time),N/A,"Irrigation levels are considered.
