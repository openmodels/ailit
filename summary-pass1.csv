Carbon taxation with redistribution can correct the carbon externality and raise welfare, but requires immediate and global adoption by major emitters like China to be effective. Absent policy, economic growth will be undermined differentially across regions. Optimal carbon tax policies can only limit peak global damages by about 44%. Optimal carbon taxes accelerate over time and a simple, time-invariant growth suffices to produce the vast majority of policy's welfare impacts. A uniform welfare improvement (UWI) policy makes everyone better off but may impose high tax costs on low-income regions; limiting net taxes (UWIL policy) leads to more uniform welfare gains. Carbon taxation aligns with Paris Agreement goals and significantly lowers climate damages for most regions. Optimal carbon taxes reduce fossil fuel consumption. Some regions may need to transfer significant portions of future consumption to others. India's share of world output in 2100 is affected by carbon policy. Substitutability between clean and dirty energy affects carbon damages and optimal tax levels. Only China and the US show significant regional social cost of carbon (SCC) in some scenarios. A compensatory carbon tax policy can achieve a win-win for all cohorts, with UWIL addressing time consistency issues. SCC is high for regions with high GDP. SCC varies significantly across regions, scenarios, and time periods. Global SCC is significantly higher than regional estimates. Russia and Canada may benefit from warming due to initially low temperatures. Lower damages result in higher GDP and emissions.","The model examines the distributional effects of climate change and carbon policies across regions and generations, focusing on a uniform welfare improving (UWI) carbon policy involving carbon taxes and generation/region-specific lump-sum redistributions. The handshake between climate and economics occurs via temperature-dependent damage to total factor productivity (TFP). The model includes region-specific parameters and equations for energy demands, incorporating finite energy reserves and extraction costs. Calibration uses UN population projections, McGlade and Ekins (2015) for fossil fuel reserves, Folini et al. (2024) for climate parameters, and Benzell et al.(2017) for initial asset distribution. Brazil is projected to end fossil fuel use first (2045), followed by China (2092) and the US (2105) under BAU, which falls between RCP6.0 and RCP4.5 emission scenarios. Optimal carbon taxation depends on the distribution of efficiency gains, as SCC-based taxes can harm early generations without wealth transfers, with carbon tax revenues initially rebated to dirty-energy company owners.

Frameworks for adaptation often incorporate stress-testing, scenario storylines, probabilistic projections, and risk decomposition. Techniques like IRS, ARS, multi-objective optimization, process-based models, and participatory workshops guide decision-making and model refinement. Systems like LandSyMM integrate economic, vegetation, and climate systems to assess adaptation-mitigation interplay.

The document emphasizes systematic assessments, promoting low-regret, evidence-based adaptation choices, enhancing stakeholder confidence in model projections, and developing robust policies adaptable to diverse climate futures.","Bottom-up adaptation studies often neglect remote impacts, unlike top-down CGE models. Adaptation modeling faces challenges like temporal complexity, uncertainty, scale, and quantifying benefits. Refinements are needed to account for heterogeneity. Climate services support climate action via frameworks like the European Research and Innovation Roadmap, which requires integrated human dimensions research. Strong user interaction is key when developing climate scenarios. The COVID-19 pandemic illustrates risk quantification difficulties. Model parameters should adequately control model outputs and rely on climatic boundary conditions; sensitivity analysis is always applicable. Field-based adaptation stress-testing has observation period limitations. Models must consider the interconnectedness of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, local conditions, and factors like vegetation in landslide risk mitigation. Decision-led frameworks are favored given climate uncertainty, with uncertainty managing techniques for agricultural projections needed. Methodologies can be adapted to any coastal region by considering feedback mechanisms, regional data, and other factors. DRR measures can be 'exposure-reducing' or 'pathway-obstructing'. Climate change risk assessments can be integrated into existing assessments, with the IRS method requiring investigation in sectors outside water and agriculture. There is a need for modeling tools to incorporate vegetation effects in landslide mitigation. Current crop models often neglect extreme weather events and aspects of crop rotation. Socio-hydrological modeling approaches are being explored. Weather-based insurance can avoid costly individualized loss assessments but needs improvements in model design that incorporate non-stationary processes to account for climate change impacts. Global flood models (GFMs) face benchmarking difficulties because of component variability. Focus is needed on the interaction between adaptation and mitigation in land use and food systems, including small-scale actor decisions. Integration of non-economic drivers and bilateral trade is crucial. Modeling can be applied to water resource management, simulating infrastructure, demand, and adaptation. Mixed approaches, combining narratives and quantitative scenarios, are used. Considering cascading failures in interdependent networks is critical. Integration across disciplines needs strengthening through modeling hierarchies and longitudinal analysis. Adaptively efficient institutions handle complexity despite uncertainty. Emissions accounting should be integrated into business value chains and aligned with financial transparency standards, including Scope 3 emissions assessment. Insurance can incentivize risk reduction. There is a need to increase the availability, reliability, and accessibility of high-resolution climate information, improve quantitative assessment of adaptation cost and effectiveness, and provide systematic guidance and case studies. Risk metrics must be placed in the local context, accounting for socio-economic development and exposure. Participatory approaches, stakeholder engagement, and impact chain methodologies are valuable. Risk assessment should not be driven by data availability alone and is value-based. Emphasis is on a medium-term perspective (10-40 years) and decision-making under deep uncertainty.

Economic and environmental adaptation benefits are crucial for resilient food systems, with strategic focus on water resources and interdisciplinary research enhancing adaptive capacity.","Adaptation assessments require practical approaches and address challenges in science and policy interconnections. Adaptation involves temporal complexity, uncertainty, varied aggregation scales, and difficulty in quantifying benefits. Adaptation measures include both quick and long-lasting options, and models need to reflect their heterogeneity. Sectors, resources, domestic/international demand are considered in models. Climate services are crucial for climate action, requiring further assessment and investment, with the European Research and Innovation Roadmap for Climate Services providing a framework. Stakeholder interaction and human dimensions are vital. COVID-19 illustrates the challenges of understanding complex shocks, while interventions (land use, human activities) should demonstrably influence model output. Model behavior is influenced by climatic boundary conditions. Sensitivity analysis is useful regardless of system observations. Field-based adaptation stress-testing is limited by observation period conditions. UN Sustainable Development Goals are interconnected, including their water aspects. Shading rivers has context-specific efficacy. Decision-led frameworks are preferred for adaptation planning under uncertainty. The EOA index aids in discarding low-confidence adaptation options. Uncertainty management is needed in agricultural projections, with optimal combinations of cultivars and management being key. Diagrams show interactions between climate, emissions/land-use, and socioeconomic processes in determining risk. The presented methodology is adaptable to any coastal region. Feedback mechanisms, data availability, and climate change predictions are essential in coastal modeling, with DRR measures being 'exposure-reducing' or 'pathway-obstructing'. Methodologies aim to integrate climate change risk assessments into existing assessments, like the National Security Strategy for Society. IRS methods have limited uptake outside water resource management and agriculture but can be extended nationally. Model development is needed for vegetation effects in landslide risk mitigation. European Commission invests in Nature-Based Solutions (NBS), but modelling vegetation's effects on slope stability is complex and uncertain, requiring local instrumentation and model development. Crop rotation modeling may be relevant to US agriculture. Crop models need improvement regarding extreme weather events, CO2 stimulation, and simulation of crop rotation/tillage effects. Socio-hydrological modeling approaches are being explored. Weather-based insurance can avoid costly loss assessments, with models focusing on producer strategies, demand for WII, and weather forecast quality, while considering non-stationary processes to account for climate change. Global flood models (GFMs) have varying components, making uncertainty understanding difficult. The interaction between adaptation and mitigation in land use and food systems needs more emphasis, considering direct and indirect adaptation mechanisms. Models often neglect small-scale actors' decisions. Mitigation actions can affect agricultural land availability and food prices. LandSyMM is a tool for understanding adaptation-mitigation interactions. Non-economic drivers and bilateral trade need integration in modeling. Water resource management includes simulating water supply infrastructure, water demand, and adaptation practices. Mixed approaches combining narratives and quantitative scenarios are used. Cascading failures in interdependent networks must be considered, and cases in New Zealand and Great Britain are available. Integration across disciplines remains weak, requiring modeling hierarchies and longitudinal analysis of transaction costs. Adaptive institutions handle evolving dilemmas despite uncertainty. Institutional lock-in can constrain corrective action in water resource management. Scope 3 emissions are crucial in private sector GHG assessments, despite complexities, aligned with sustainable finance action plan and European taxonomy on sustainable finance. ISO standards are relevant for GHG management. Insurance can incentivize risk reduction, but standard BI policies may be insufficient, requiring availability, reliability, and accessibility of climate information. Cost-effectiveness data and guidance tools/case studies are needed, and local context is key. Overlooking socio-economic development and using fixed vulnerability leads to underestimating risk. Frameworks have been applied in numerous national climate risk assessments worldwide, using participatory approaches for stakeholder engagement, and impact chain methodology reveals critical system elements. Risk assessment should not be driven by data availability only and is value-based. Hybrid and hypothesis-driven methods validation is challenging. Medium-term perspectives are emphasized. Decision-making focuses on robust solutions under deep uncertainty. Several projects and initiatives such as Outlook 2030 project, CORASVE projects, JPI Climate, ERA4CS, AXIS, and SOLSTICE, involve local stakeholders and aim to improve climate information and integrate social sciences/humanities.",Acute shocks,Adaptive,Global,Sectoral Interactions,Adaptive (reflecting shifts in economic behavior in response to impacts),N/A,"Adaptation is considered through various modeling approaches: IAMs (explicitly, implicitly, or autonomously), computable general equilibrium models (like GRACE), sectoral models for impact and adaptation, dynamic flood risk modeling, model-based response surface approaches, and top-down/bottom-up integrations.

Global carbon taxation, combined with interregional and intergenerational redistribution, can mitigate climate damage and improve overall welfare. However, carbon taxes set at carbon's marginal social cost may be insufficient without immediate and universal adoption, particularly by major emitters like China. Optimal carbon taxes can significantly lower climate damages, limit fossil fuel consumption, and align with Paris Agreement goals, but may require substantial transfers from future generations in certain regions.
