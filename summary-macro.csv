The analysis uses temperature data and historical evidence to link temperature changes to mortality, migration, trade, city size (population), and agricultural land use (pasture, cropland, yield ratios, and wheat prices). Regression models employ fixed effects (city, time, decade, parish, county/year, port, country, location), control variables (geographic, historical, access to ocean, Atlantic trade, market access, terrain ruggedness, soil suitability, distance to Roman road, altitude), and adjustments for spatial and serial correlation (Conley standard errors, two-way clustered standard errors, bootstrapped standard errors clustered at the city level, standard errors clustered at the grid level). A gravity model of trade is used to measure potential trade opportunities, and binned scatterplots are used for visualization. The study leverages historical data sources such as Slicher van Bath (1963), Luterbacher et al. (2004), and the History Database of the Global Environment.

The impact of temperature changes on migration is also considered. The modifying role of trade opportunities in the temperature-city size relationship is investigated. Changes in pasture and cropland in relation to temperature shifts are examined.","Climate change, exemplified by the Little Ice Age, significantly impacts economies, primarily through agricultural productivity, mortality, and city size. Decreased temperatures correlate with reduced agricultural yields, increased mortality (especially in agriculture-dependent economies with limited trade), and smaller city sizes. However, trade acts as a crucial buffer, mitigating these negative effects. Cities with greater trade access and less rugged terrain are less vulnerable to temperature decreases. Adaptation strategies include increased trade, land-use changes (potentially expanding pasture and cropland), and market access. Temperature positively correlates with pasture and cropland area, but the exact relationship between temperature change and land use is complex. Access to trade is key for adapting to the negative economic impacts of long-term temperature changes.","The study examines the historical impact of climate change, particularly during the Little Ice Age in Europe, utilizing historical data from 1500-1850 to assess adaptation strategies such as trade and land use changes. Inland trade opportunities and geographic factors like natural barriers played significant roles in moderating economic impacts of temperature changes. Adaptation challenges in agriculture and energy efficiency are noted, with higher income reducing climate impacts. Historical measures to improve resilience included expanding productive land and trade networks. The analysis extends to the effects of temperature on city size, economic activity, and agricultural productivity, using controls for historical determinants like trade and human capital. However, the data's historical and regional specificity, along with methodological limitations, restricts its direct applicability to contemporary macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risk assessments of climate change adaptation. Trade's importance in adaptation and the vulnerability of agriculture-dependent economies with limited access are underscored, especially for developing countries.",1.0

Some analysis identifies effects of climate change on desertification.","Climate change poses a significant risk to financial stability, with both physical and transition risks acting as key mechanisms. The impacts are nonlinear, asymmetric, and path-dependent, potentially triggering domino effects. Positive (e.g., temperature decreases) and negative (e.g., temperature increases) climate shocks both harm financial stability, but their short-term and long-term effects differ. Positive shocks tend to have a greater short-term impact, while negative shocks lead to larger and more destructive long-term adjustments. The long-term damage of climate change on financial stability outweighs the short-term damage. Climate policies, such as a rapid conversion to a low-carbon economy, can also introduce risks like economic recession and financial instability, potentially exceeding those from natural disasters. Changes in CO2 concentration significantly impact financial stability, exhibiting asymmetric long-run effects.","This material focuses on the relationship between climate change and financial stability, particularly in China. It explores the nonlinear and asymmetric impacts of climate change (specifically temperature changes and climate disasters) on financial stability, using methods like NARDL and impulse response functions. The analysis considers both short-term and long-term perspectives, drawing on the work of IPCC, NGFS, Nordhaus, Dietz & Stern, and others. The study distinguishes between physical and transition risks and references prior work on firm value, damage functions, and desertification, connecting these to broader macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks.

The focus is on calibrating and evaluating climate emulators within integrated assessment models (IAMs) like DICE-2016 to improve the accuracy of climate change projections and inform mitigation strategies. Damage functions that link temperature to economic output are used, but there is no mention of adaptation measures to reduce these damages. The analysis centres on the social cost of carbon (SCC) and optimal mitigation policies based on different climate model calibrations and economic parameters.","Key findings relate to the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and the performance of climate-economic models, particularly DICE-2016. The choice of parameters in climate emulators significantly impacts the predicted SCC, highlighting the importance of considering model uncertainty, especially concerning Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) and Transient Climate Response (TCR). DICE-2016 is seriously flawed as it fails to reproduce CO2 and temperature evolution accurately. Its climate module is miscalibrated, leading to an SCC that is oversensitive to the discount rate and underestimates optimal carbon taxes, resulting in temperature responses outside expected ranges. Compensating errors exist within DICE-2016. The functional form of damage functions (including higher-order terms) significantly affects the impact of climate model uncertainty on the SCC. Varying only the ECS parameter is insufficient for capturing full climate model uncertainty, leading to SCC underestimation. Different reasonable climate model calibrations lead to vastly different predictions for CO2 concentrations, temperatures, and damages. Optimal emissions are predicted to exceed RCP26, surpassing the Paris limit. DICE-2016 overestimates carbon and initially underestimates temperature increases compared to other calibrations and leads to larger damages and higher temperatures but similar SCC due to discounting. The SCC is highly sensitive to the growth-adjusted interest rate and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (IES).","This research emphasizes the recalibration of climate emulators within Integrated Assessment Models, focusing primarily on the DICE model, using CMIP5 data for improved accuracy. It highlights the significance of accurately aligning economic models with climate data to better understand climate change costs and scenarios. Structural flaws in DICE-2016's temperature equations and carbon cycle partially offset each other, affecting the model's outputs. Findings suggest that temperature calibration impacts outweigh those of carbon cycle calibration on predictions of damages. The speed of warming impacts the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) more than long-term temperature forecasts, and the SCC aligns with an optimal carbon tax under specific conditions. The analysis indicates that miscalibrations can yield different projections and policy recommendations, stressing limitations of climate emulators in capturing complex feedbacks. Discounting and interest rate assumptions are key in understanding long-term climate-economic interactions. Consideration of uncertainties and climate sensitivity is essential for robust policy guidance.",1.0

*   An adaptation deficit, disproportionately affecting poorer countries, arises from both income and efficiency factors. Addressing it requires inclusive growth policies and targeted adaptation support, especially where inefficiencies are high.
*   Higher GDP per capita is generally associated with lower disaster deaths and economic damages, while higher income inequality often increases fatalities.
*   Effective disaster management is linked to strong institutions, higher government expenditure as a percentage of GDP, and lower political and socioeconomic risks.
*   The impact of various socioeconomic factors, including trade openness, credit to GDP ratio, and institutional quality, on disaster losses can vary depending on the disaster type (floods vs. cyclones) and model specifications.
*   Disaster magnitude and population size are significant predictors of disaster losses (deaths and economic damages). Land mass tends to reduce deaths and economic damages in cyclone events.
*   Country-specific factors are important; some countries perform better or worse than expected given their income levels.
*   Economic growth and rational decisions can outpace adaptation efforts.
*   Disaster magnitude, population, and GDP per capita are major drivers of flood deaths, while Gini coefficient increases flood deaths and government expenditure reduces flood deaths.
*   Disaster magnitude and population size are major drivers of tropical cyclone deaths, while larger area, higher GDP per capita, higher cyclone propensity, and higher government expenditure all tend to decrease deaths, and the Gini coefficient tends to increase cyclone deaths.
*   Disaster magnitude and total GDP are major drivers of flood and cyclone economic damages, while larger area and higher Life Expectancy tend to decrease economic damages from flood events. Several socioeconomic factors affect disaster loss prevention.","The study examines the relationship between income, climate security, and adaptation decisions, focusing on flood and tropical cyclone events. It uses the Munich Re database, acknowledging potential measurement errors in economic damage estimates. Key findings include the potential undercounting of economic losses suffered by poorer populations and the correlation between adaptive capacity for different types of events.

Floods are the most frequent disaster, particularly impacting Latin America & the Caribbean and Asia. Inequality significantly predicts both physical damages and the number of people affected by disasters; wet disasters have a greater impact on income inequality than dry disasters. La Ni√±a increases the number of people affected by wet disasters, while a higher rural population increases exposure to human impact. Public expenditure reduces inequality. Wealthier countries are more resilient to disasters, but repeated extreme climatic events can trap unequal countries in a vulnerability cycle, highlighting the interplay of climate and socioeconomic factors.","Synopsis: Explores the complex relationships between climate-related disasters, inequality, and vulnerability, accounting for bidirectional causality and distinguishing between wet and dry disasters. Uses panel data analysis, employing GDP per capita and HDI as proxies for willingness to pay for a safer environment, and controls for socioeconomic conditions, disaster characteristics, inequality, government expenditure, and geographic factors. It addresses endogeneity concerns using instrumental variables (distance from equator and agriculture value added). Findings suggest a non-linear relationship between development level and disaster impacts, and that public spending's impact on disaster recovery may be influenced by its composition and rent-seeking. Emphasizes the need for adaptation mechanisms to keep pace with climate change and ensure equitable access to precautionary and recovery measures, and examines feedback loops between disaster exposure and inequality, where results are sensitive to disaster type and baseline inequality levels.",1.0
