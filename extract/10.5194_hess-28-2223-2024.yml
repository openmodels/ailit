Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (reduced water demand); High water prices; Economic depression;
    Water demand changes causing idle water supply facilities and revenue losses.
  2: Climate change impacts on water availability; Over-reliance on water demand-side
    solutions; Economic and environmental costs of new water storage construction;
    Population reduction, the exit of farmers, and deindustrialization.
  3: "Uncertain environmental changes; Climate and socioeconomic changes; Population\
    \ migration and economic upgrades; Insufficient data; Incomplete understanding\
    \ of China\u2019s overall water governance system; Political dynamics between\
    \ national and regional government; Financial constraints of project maintenance."
  6: Increasing human water use, potentially leading to environmental flow reduction.
  7: Water deficits, drought, siltation, competing water demands (environmental vs.
    consumptive users).
  8: No relevant information
  9: Climate change impacts on water supply uncertainties. Economic unfeasibility
    of large-scale water projects.
  11: Climate change leading to altered rainfall patterns (increased rainfall in the
    north, droughts in the south) affecting the demand for water transferred by the
    SNWDP.
  12: Climate change is affecting water availability, requiring adaptable water resource
    management strategies.
Highlights:
  1: Water demand management can challenge the sustainability of water supply systems
    due to revenue losses from reduced water use. The South-to-North Water Diversion
    Project in China is presented as an example of integrating supply and demand-side
    water management, with ecological and cultural water releases being important.
  2: Water demand management strategies can have unintended negative economic consequences
    such as industry loss or increased financial burden; Decline in water use may
    not continue under climate change; Water supply infrastructure is important to
    ensure stable and reliable water to both societies and ecosystems.
  3: A co-governance framework was established to enhance the sustainability of water
    resources system through understanding the emerging supply-side dilemma caused
    by water demand changes in the context of environmental change.
  6: The SNWDP is not a traditional engineering method but an integrated governance
    system that includes both supply-side and demand-side solutions with the aim of
    increasing the ecological water supply.
  7: The SNWDP has reversed the downward trend of groundwater levels, increased water
    storage in reservoirs, restored environmental flows in rivers, and made the Beijing-Hangzhou
    Grand Canal navigable again, serving both environmental and cultural purposes.
  8: No relevant information
  9: Proposes a flexible water-pricing system and equitable cost distribution to enhance
    the South-to-North Water Diversion Project's economic viability and social acceptability.
  11: Increased rainfall in northern China is leading to decreased reliance on the
    SNWDP.
  12: The SNWDP is an integrated system managing both supply- and demand-side water
    issues, balancing operational costs, environmental impacts, and stakeholder needs.
Methodology:
  1: A co-governance framework integrating political, financial, and consumptive needs
    of the government, market, and users, coupling supply-side and demand-side solutions.
  3: Co-governance framework for sustainable water demand management, focusing on
    the interplay among political dynamics between national and regional government
    and financial constraints of the project maintenance.
  6: Analysis of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) as an integrated
    governance system.
  7: Case study analysis of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) in
    China, focusing on a co-governance framework for water demand management.
  8: No relevant information
  9: Discussion of practical strategies, energy efficiency solutions, flexible water
    pricing, and equitable cost distribution within a supply-demand co-governance
    framework.
  11: Analysis of the impact of climate change on the water demand dynamics of the
    SNWDP.
  12: The study uses a literature review and a case study of the SNWDP in China to
    develop a co-governance framework for water management.
More Notes:
  1: The paper reframes water demand management to consider the broader impacts of
    water use changes on water supply system sustainability and revenue generation
    for the state. The proposed framework emphasizes collaborative strategies and
    considers the interplay between supply and demand in water resource management,
    potentially offering insights into broader resource management challenges under
    climate change.
  2: The text emphasizes a co-governance framework coupling supply-side and demand-side
    water management.
  3: Focus on the South-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) in China as a case study.
  6: The page focuses on water management strategies and ecological benefits, with
    limited direct macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. However, efficient water management
    can have indirect impacts on agricultural productivity, industrial output, and
    regional economic stability, which in turn can affect macroeconomic indicators.
  7: The paper highlights the importance of considering ecological water entitlement
    early in the planning stages of water diversion projects to avoid conflicts and
    ensure environmental sustainability. The three-tier governance structure of the
    SNWDP, involving national, corporate, and provincial levels, is presented as a
    model for integrated water management.
