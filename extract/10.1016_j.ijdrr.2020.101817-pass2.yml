Drivers of Risk:
  3: No relevant information
  5: Environmental and human risks, disasters, climate change.
  7: Various natural hazards
Highlights:
  3: No relevant information
  5: EEA places a higher emphasis on private funding and human behavior compared to
    ESPREssO. Both studies acknowledge institutional and operational gaps hampering
    DRR and CCA implementation.
  7: Stresses the importance of an integrated methodological and operational approach
    for DRR and CCA in a risk-oriented modeling and design-oriented perspective.
Methodology:
  3: No relevant information
  5: Compares ESPREssO project findings with EEA assessments, focusing on coherence
    and divergence in approaches to DRR and CCA.
  7: Mentions the TEM model developed to simulate CO2 emissions and the impact of
    financial means, emphasizing its scalability for high-performance computing and
    suitability for co-design and co-development of climate services.
More Notes:
  3: This page focuses on the conceptual and practical overlap, differences, synergies,
    and barriers between Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) and Disaster Risk Reduction
    (DRR). It does not delve into specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, costs,
    or benefits. The paper emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive approach integrating
    CCA and DRR efforts, highlighting the need for coherence and cooperation between
    different communities and stakeholders to achieve resilience goals.
  5: The page discusses the importance of public participation, cooperation between
    institutions, and the need for better monitoring and evaluation of DRR and CCA
    measures. It also touches upon the role of human behavior in risk management and
    the significance of financial instruments and institutions in disaster financing.
  7: Highlights the potential for external contributions from private stakeholders,
    including the insurance sector and public-private partnerships, but notes it's
    not adequately investigated.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: No relevant information
  5: Not explicitly stated in terms of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. Focuses on
    disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) integration
    and implementation.
  7: Discusses financial tools and institutions to cope with environmental and human-induced
    risks, mentioning insurance as individual protection against losses from natural
    hazards.
Quantitative material:
  3: No relevant information
  5: The table provides rankings (0-4) for different dimensions across ESPREssO and
    EEA studies, but these are not direct measures of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
