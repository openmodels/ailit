Drivers of Risk:
  9: Environmental degradation impacts agriculture, mining and living stock which
    are important sectors for the regional economy. Climate change and biodiversity
    loss risk. Fossil fuels and plastic consumption.
Highlights:
  9: Public policies are categorised into regulatory policies, incentives, and disincentives.
    Regulations around climate change are needed, migrating from voluntary recommendations
    to mandatory requirements. Incentives are needed to foster both proper economic
    recovery and adequate mitigation and adaptation strategies. Tax reform is needed
    to finance public policies without depending on international funding. All actors
    (public sector, private sector, civil society, and academia) need to be involved.
Methodology:
  4: This study uses a qualitative futures study to identify how Latin American and
    Caribbean countries can build long-term resilience, focusing on adaptiveness to
    climate change risks, existing sustainable development challenges, and the impacts
    of the COVID-19 pandemic. It develops future-oriented scenarios for policymaking
    from a sustainability perspective, using a focus group protocol based on futures
    methodologies and Shell's seven questions futures technique. Data collection is
    replicated in seven countries with representative sampling.
  9: Participatory futures methodologies workshops, with experts from different stakeholder
    groups, used to assess alternative futures for Latin America and the Caribbean
    in the post-COVID19 context.
More Notes:
  9: The analysis focuses on Latin America and the Caribbean. The perspective is pro-business
    but acknowledges the need for regulation to ensure sustainable exploitation of
    natural resources.
