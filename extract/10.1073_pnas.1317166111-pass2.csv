3,Household,Any,Indonesia,CMIP3,Migration Probability,AvoidedImpact,Economic,Need,Probability,0,NA,,,,,"Table 2, Discussion",Reports the change in annual outmigration probability under projected low- and high-temperature increase scenarios. Could be interpreted as avoided migration due to adaptation or increased migration as a cost of inaction. Setting Value=0 as a placeholder because NA is invalid.
