Drivers of Risk:
  1: Variations in temperature and precipitation; sudden natural disasters
  3: Temperature, Precipitation, and Natural Disasters (Earthquake, Eruption, Flood,
    Landslide).
  5: Temperature increases and, to a lesser extent, changes in precipitation.
  6: Temperature increases due to climate change; Natural disasters such as floods,
    volcanoes, landslides, and earthquakes.
Highlights:
  1: Permanent migration is influenced by climatic variations, whereas episodic disasters
    tend to have much smaller or no impact on such migration; an increase in temperature
    is related to an increase in outmigration, potentially through its impact on economic
    conditions.
  3: "Temperature has a significantly nonlinear effect on migration, with migration\
    \ increasing sharply above 25\xB0C. Precipitation also exhibits a nonlinear effect.\
    \ Landslides have a consistent positive effect on migration, while other disasters\
    \ generally do not have large or consistent effects."
  5: Temperature has a strongly non-linear effect on permanent migration, with provinces
    starting at higher temperatures experiencing considerably higher increases in
    outmigration probability.
  6: Temperature is likely to influence migration through its impact on local economic
    conditions. The finding has significant implications for future effects of global
    warming on migration.
Methodology:
  1: Microlevel study using household panel data from Indonesia over 15 years (7,185
    households) to analyze province-to-province migration.
  3: Regression analysis using multidimensional clusters to account for correlations
    within province year and within-household correlation over time. Spatial autocorrelation
    accounted for by collapsing household-level data to province-year level and using
    a spatial autocorrelation estimator. Province and time fixed effects are included.
    Logarithmic transformation of measures of disasters and household asset value
    used.
  5: The study uses a quadratic model for the temperature effect on migration, based
    on environmental factors measured for 2 and 4 years, and applies regression coefficients
    to projected temperature increases based on CMIP3 model outputs. Panel data analysis
    is used to show the migration response to period-to-period temperature variability.
  6: Uses data from the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), a household panel survey.
    Constructs records of whole-household migration flows over three time periods
    (1993-1997, 1997-2000, 2000-2007). Uses annual migration probability of household.
    Data for natural disasters is derived from the DesInventar database.
More Notes:
  1: The study aims to improve on existing studies by simultaneously exploring the
    effects of sudden natural disasters and climatic variations on permanent migration
    of the whole household.
  3: The effect of temperature on migration is more pronounced than that of precipitation.
    The analysis uses various measures of disaster impact (deaths, injured, houses
    destroyed, financial losses).
  5: The magnitude of the effects of temperature on migration may vary by location
    due to unobservable characteristics in different country settings that cannot
    be fully controlled for.
  6: The study focuses on Indonesia and mentions factors specific to Indonesia like
    its tropical climate, dependence on agriculture, and strong culture of interprovincial
    migration.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  3: Annual probability of household migration.
  5: Climate change induced migration, specifically the annual probability of whole-household
    migration to another province.
  6: Permanent migration of households is influenced by increases in temperature.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Temperature above 25\xB0C is related to an increase in outmigration."
  3: "The turning point for temperature is 25\xB0C, above which outmigration increases\
    \ nonlinearly. A 1\xB0C increase from 26\xB0C to 27\xB0C increases migration probability\
    \ by 0.008 (0.8% points), while a 1\xB0C increase from 27\xB0C to 28\xB0C raises\
    \ it by 0.014. Turning point for precipitation is ~2.2 m, below which increased\
    \ rainfall reduces outmigration. With a rise in precipitation from 2.3 m to 3.3\
    \ m, annual migration probability increases by 0.00146. A 1% increase in deaths\
    \ and houses destroyed from landslides raises annual migration probability by\
    \ 0.000006 and 0.000004, respectively."
  5: "A temperature increase to 26.9\xB0C (low projection) and 27.4\xB0C (high projection)\
    \ by 2100 is projected to increase the annual probability of whole-household migration\
    \ by 0.01-0.016 compared to a baseline temperature of 25.1\xB0C."
  6: Mentions use of logarithmic transformation of disaster variables to deal with
    skewed distribution and bias. Uses province-level measures of average annual precipitation
    and temperature from the University of Delaware, measured on a 0.5 x 0.5 degree
    grid. Temperature is measured in degrees Celsius, and precipitation in meters
    per year.
