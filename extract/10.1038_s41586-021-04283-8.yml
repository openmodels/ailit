Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increases in the number of wet days; increases in extreme daily rainfall; changes
    in total annual rainfall; changes in standardized monthly deviations of rainfall;
    anthropogenic intensification of daily rainfall extremes.
  2: Total annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days, and extreme
    daily rainfall.
  3: Rainfall measures (annual total, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days,
    extreme daily rainfall)
  4: Extreme daily rainfall, number of wet days, monthly positive rainfall deviations,
    monthly negative rainfall deviations, annual total rainfall
  5: Changes in rainfall patterns, including extreme daily rainfall, number of wet
    days, annual total rainfall, and monthly rainfall deviations.
  6: "Changes in annual climate measures, specifically annual total rainfall, monthly\
    \ rainfall deviations, number of wet days (RD(1\u2009mm)x,y), and extreme daily\
    \ rainfall (RD\u02C6(99.9%)x,y)."
  7: Extreme daily rainfall, annual mean temperature, day-to-day temperature variability.
  10: Total annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days, and
    extreme daily rainfall.
  11: Total annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days, and
    extreme daily rainfall (implicitly, temperature)
  12: "Daily temperature variability (T_var), annual mean temperature changes (D.T.mean,\
    \ L.D.T.mean), interactions between temperature levels and changes (L.D.T.mean:L.T.mean),\
    \ annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days (No. wet days,\
    \ No. wet days\xB2), and extreme daily rainfall (Extreme daily rainfall, Extreme\
    \ daily rainfall\xB2)"
Highlights:
  1: High-income nations and the services and manufacturing sectors are most strongly
    hindered by both measures of daily rainfall (number of wet days and extreme rainfall);
    Previous work emphasized the beneficial effects of additional total annual rainfall
    in low-income, agriculturally dependent economies
  2: 1. Greater annual rainfall benefits economic growth but benefits diminish with
    greater climatological totals. 2. Monthly rainfall deviations negatively impact
    growth, especially negative deviations. 3. Increased wet days and extreme daily
    rainfall reduce economic productivity, indicating regional adaptation effects.
  3: Greater rainfall may be beneficial, but this is only true if it does not also
    cause increases in the number of wet days or in the extent of extreme daily rainfall;
    The effects of the daily rainfall measures are decreased by the exclusion of the
    annual and monthly rainfall measures, and vice versa, suggesting they are complementary
    measures.
  4: The effects of wet days and extreme rainfall are strongest in winter and autumn,
    with little response in summer and spring; no evidence for rebound effects in
    the short term; impacts have been largest from the number of wet days and negative
    monthly rainfall deviations; effects from the total annual rainfall and extreme
    daily rainfall have been smaller and show greater regional heterogeneity.
  5: Increases in extreme daily rainfall and the number of wet days are adverse for
    economic growth, particularly in high-income countries and via the manufacturing
    and service sectors; Focusing on the beneficial effects of greater annual rainfall
    for agriculturally dependent low-income countries alone provides an incomplete
    picture of the economic effects of rainfall changes.
  6: "The study identifies statistically significant effects on subnational per-capita\
    \ growth rates from the number of wet days RD(1\u2009mm)x,y and extreme daily\
    \ rainfall RD\u02C6(99.9%)x,y. A quadratic effect of the number of wet days is\
    \ noted."
  7: The study assesses the impact of extreme rainfall on subnational growth rates,
    finding heterogeneous effects based on income levels. The effects of rainfall
    are considered independent and additive, and historical effect sizes for different
    rainfall measures are presented. A nonlinear effect of wet days on income level
    is considered.
  10: Economic growth responses to rainfall changes are distinct between rich and
    poor nations, with various meteorological factors, such as rainfall and temperature
    variations, affecting growth differentially based on economic status.
  11: Sectoral growth responses to various rainfall and temperature variables are
    estimated and presented, showing differing sensitivities across sectors.
  12: The table presents the impact of temperature and rainfall variables on economic
    growth rates, with statistical significance levels reported for regional and national
    error clustering.
Methodology:
  1: Global panel data analysis of subnational economic output; Assessment of higher-order
    moments of the annual distribution of daily rainfall; Threshold approach to count
    wet days and extreme rainfall events; Calculation of total annual rainfall and
    standardized monthly rainfall anomalies; Using rainfall data from ERA-5.
  2: "Fixed-effects panel regression models using historical observation data from\
    \ 1979\u20132019 with subnational level data to evaluate spatial variability in\
    \ climate and economic outcomes."
  3: "Regional estimates are obtained via the product of the region-specific marginal\
    \ effects and the region-specific standard deviation for each rainfall measure\
    \ (from annual variability over the historical period 1979\u20132019); Effects\
    \ from rainfall are separately identifiable when included as competing independent\
    \ variables on economic growth rates (equation (5) in Methods)."
  4: "Panel regression with national income per capita as a partitioning variable,\
    \ examining sector-specific economic output, controlling for linear or quadratic\
    \ region-specific time trends, using distributed lag models, assessing spatial\
    \ heterogeneity by multiplying regional estimates of marginal effects with the\
    \ historical standard deviation of each measure, historical period 1979\u2013\
    2019"
  5: Regression analysis assessing the effects of various rainfall measures on sectoral
    economic output and above/below-median national income countries.
  6: Fixed-effects panel regression models are used to estimate relationships between
    changes in annual climate measures and subnational per-capita growth rates, including
    regional and yearly fixed effects and potentially region-specific linear or quadratic
    time trends. Area-weighted and population-weighted means are used for aggregating
    data to the regional level.
  7: "The authors use regression analysis to assess the impact of rainfall measures\
    \ (RA, RD(1mm), R\u02C6D(99.9%)) and temperature on subnational growth rates,\
    \ controlling for day-to-day temperature variability. They partition data by income\
    \ (above and below-medium income per capita) to assess heterogeneity. The period\
    \ covered is implied to be 1979-2019 based on the data used to calculate the standard\
    \ deviations."

More Notes:
  3: The marginal effects of increases in extreme daily rainfall show a regional heterogeneity
    that is best described by the annual mean temperature.
  4: The paper investigates the persistence of climate impacts and spatial heterogeneity.
    It finds that the effect arises due to seasonal economic vulnerability rather
    than differing seasonal characteristics of rainfall.
  6: Economic data is obtained from the Database of Subnational Economic output (DoSE).
    Climate data is primarily from the ERA-5 reanalysis of historical observations,
    supplemented with MSWEP and PGF data.
  7: The data used includes economic production data and ERA-5 climate data, both
    publicly available. The code to reproduce the analysis is also publicly available.
    The study received funding from the Volkswagen Foundation and the Horizon 2020
    Framework Programme of the European Union.
  11: The histograms provide information about the distribution of rainfall and temperature
    data. The graphs show marginal effects, meaning the change in growth rate for
    a unit change in the climatic variable.

    respectively.
