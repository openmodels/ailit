Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increases in the number of wet days and in extreme daily rainfall, in addition
    to responding nonlinearly to the total annual and to the standardized monthly
    deviations of rainfall.
  2: Drivers of risk include total annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number
    of wet days (days with rainfall exceeding 1mm), and extreme daily rainfall (annual
    sum of rainfall on days exceeding the 99.9th percentile of historical distribution).
  3: Annual total rainfall, Monthly rainfall deviations (negative shock), Number of
    wet days, Extreme daily rainfall
  4: Extreme daily rainfall, number of wet days (total and seasonal), monthly positive/negative
    rainfall deviations, annual total rainfall.
  6: "Annual total rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days (RD(1\u2009\
    mm)x,y), and extreme daily rainfall (RD\u02C6(99.9%)x,y)."
  7: The drivers of risk are rainfall measures, including total rainfall (RA), wet
    days (RD(1mm)), and extreme wet days (RD(99.9%)).
  8: Annual total rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days, extreme
    daily rainfall.
  9: Changes in annual total rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet
    days, and extreme daily rainfall events are drivers impacting rainfall variability.
  10: Total annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days, and
    extreme daily rainfall are drivers of risk.
  11: Total annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days per year,
    and extreme daily rainfall (presented as a function of annual mean temperature).
  12: Daily temperature variability (T_var), annual mean temperature (T_mean), changes
    in annual mean temperature (D.T.mean), annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations,
    and number of wet days
Evaluation overview:
  1: Economic growth rates
  2: This paper evaluates the effect of daily rainfall distribution on economic production/growth
    rates.
  3: Economic growth rates
  4: Effect on economic growth rates is evaluated, both for all sectors and specifically
    for agriculture, manufacturing, and services.
  6: Subnational per-capita growth rates (economic output per capita)
  7: This paper evaluates the effect of extreme daily rainfall on annual mean temperature.
  8: No relevant information
  9: No relevant information
  10: Economic growth is evaluated in relation to climate variables.
  11: Economic growth rates in agricultural, manufacturing, and service sectors.
  12: Economic growth rates
Highlights:
  1: Economic growth rates are reduced by increases in the number of wet days and
    in extreme daily rainfall. High-income nations and the services and manufacturing
    sectors are most strongly hindered by both measures of daily rainfall. Anthropogenic
    intensification of daily rainfall extremes will have negative global economic
    consequences.
  2: Economic growth rates are concave with monthly rainfall deviations (negative
    rainfall shocks away from historical monthly means cause strong and significant
    losses), increases in the number of wet days result in strong reductions in growth
    rates, and increases in extreme daily rainfall cause further reductions in growth
    rates. The marginal effect from an increase in wet days is smaller in regions
    where the number of wet days is already higher.
  3: Greater rainfall may be beneficial, but this is only true if it does not also
    cause increases in the number of wet days or in the extent of extreme daily rainfall.
  4: Effects of rainfall measures are strongest in winter and autumn, showing little
    response in summer and spring. Economic impacts have been largest from the number
    of wet days and negative monthly rainfall deviations. Impacts from total annual
    rainfall and extreme daily rainfall are smaller and show greater regional heterogeneity.
  6: The analysis finds a quadratic effect of the number of wet days and a dependence
    of the effect of extreme daily rainfall on subnational per-capita growth rates.
  7: The paper finds that considering a nonlinear effect considerably increases the
    statistical power of the model when assessing heterogeneity of the effect of wet
    days with income level.
  8: 'The paper maps the historical means of four principal rainfall measures: annual
    total rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days, and extreme daily
    rainfall.  The maps illustrate the global distribution of these rainfall characteristics.'
  9: Southeast Asia and parts of South America show significant variability in annual
    total rainfall and extreme daily rainfall events. Parts of Africa and Southeast
    Asia show the most significant variability in the number of wet days per year.
    Tropical regions likely have more variability in monthly rainfall deviations.
  10: The analysis shows how different climatic variables impact growth rates differently
    for rich and poor countries.
  11: Sectoral growth responses to changes in rainfall metrics are quantified, with
    confidence intervals provided. Effects of total rainfall, rainfall variability,
    wet days, and temperature-linked extreme rainfall on agriculture, manufacturing,
    and service sectors are shown.
  12: The asterisks indicate statistical significance levels (p<0.1, p<0.05, p<0.01)
    for the coefficients, suggesting which climate variables have a statistically
    significant impact on economic growth rates.
Methodology:
  1: "Uses a global panel of subnational economic output for 1,554 regions worldwide\
    \ over the past 40 years. Assesses higher-order moments of the annual distribution\
    \ of daily rainfall in conjunction with subnational economic output. Counts both\
    \ the number of days and the amount of rainfall on days falling above a wide range\
    \ of critical thresholds to flexibly identify different possible impact channels.\
    \ Thresholds are set either as constants or as percentiles of the historical distribution\
    \ (1979\u20132019) of local daily rainfall. Calculates the total annual rainfall\
    \ and standardized monthly rainfall anomalies."
  2: Fixed-effects panel regression models are used to estimate the effect of daily
    rainfall distribution on economic production, using within-region changes from
    year to year. Historical data from 1979-2019 is used to calculate extreme daily
    rainfall. The analysis is done at a subnational level. Spatial autocorrelation
    of rainfall measures is evaluated at the subnational level.
  3: "The estimates are obtained via the product of the region-specific marginal effects\
    \ and the region-specific standard deviation for each rainfall measure (from annual\
    \ variability over the historical period 1979\u20132019)."
  4: The effect of rainfall measures on economic growth rates is estimated, partitioning
    data based on national income per capita and assessing sector-specific economic
    output. 95% confidence intervals are shown, clustered than by area. Robustness
    checks include accounting for linear or quadratic region-specific time trends
    and accounting for snowfall. Distributed lag models are used to assess persistence
    of climate impacts.
  6: Fixed-effects panel regression models are used to estimate relationships between
    changes in annual climate measures, and subnational per-capita growth rates. Regional
    and yearly fixed effects are included. Region-specific linear or quadratic time
    trends can also be included in alternative specifications. Climate data used includes
    ERA-5 reanalysis, MSWEP, and PGF.
  7: The paper uses regression analysis (equation 5) to assess the impact of rainfall
    on annual mean temperature, controlling for temperature variability and the annual
    mean temperature. The analysis considers heterogeneity by income level. Marginal
    effects are calculated as the first derivative of equation (5) with respect to
    the rainfall measures.
  8: "Analysis uses historical data (1979\u20132019) to map the means of four rainfall\
    \ measures. The extreme daily rainfall measure is the annual sum of rainfall on\
    \ days exceeding the 99.9th percentile of the historical distribution."
  9: "The analysis calculates the historical standard deviation of annual values for\
    \ four rainfall measures over the years 1979\u20132019."
  10: Economic responses to rainfall are estimated separately for rich and poor countries.
  11: Econometric analysis estimating economic responses to rainfall for agricultural,
    manufacturing, and service sectors separately. The distributions of climate variables
    are represented using a histogram in the background of the graphs.
  12: The analysis uses an econometric specification to regress temperature and rainfall
    changes on economic growth rates. The table indicates that standard errors are
    clustered either regionally or nationally, implying panel data techniques. The
    results are applicable to the period covered by the 3001 observations.
More Notes:
  1: The study uses surface precipitation rate from the European Centre for Medium-Range
    Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA-5) of historical observations.
  2: The analysis considers potential adaptation to both prolonged exposure to wet
    days and heavy rainfall conditions.
  3: The marginal effects of increases in extreme daily rainfall show a regional heterogeneity
    that is best described by the annual mean temperature.
  4: The study identifies a seasonal economic vulnerability to rainfall rather than
    differing seasonal characteristics of rainfall. Hotter seasons and years reduce
    vulnerability. Spatial heterogeneity is assessed by multiplying regional estimates
    of marginal effects with the historical standard deviation of each measure.
  7: The code and data used in the analysis are publicly available at the provided
    URLs. The analysis period for calculating within-region standard deviations is
    1979-2019. The paper assesses the average historical effect size of monthly rainfall
    deviations by evaluating a part of equation (5) at one within-region standard
    deviation.
  8: All measures are based on historical means (1979-2019) and the paper shows distributions,
    not specifically changes over time.
  9: The consistent color scale across all four maps facilitates visual comparison
    of rainfall variability across different measures.
  11: The paper presents these results as Extended Data for a main paper, so the full
    methodological details are likely found elsewhere.
  12: The table includes adjusted R-squared values to assess the goodness-of-fit of
    the regressions.
Quantitative material:
  1: Uses economic output for 1,554 regions worldwide over the past 40 years.
  2: Provides marginal effects of 1-s.d. increases in various rainfall measures on
    economic growth rates, including quadratic effects of total annual rainfall and
    monthly rainfall deviations. It finds reductions in growth rates due to increased
    wet days and extreme daily rainfall. Also, the paper mentions the use of 95% confidence
    intervals.
  3: Figure 3 shows regional estimates of the historical effect on economic growth
    rates of a 1-s.d. shock in each of the four rainfall measures (% points). Global
    and sample means of impacts across regions are given in each panel.
  4: Effect on economic growth rates of a 1-s.d. shock (% points), shares of agriculture/manufacturing/service
    sectors as a function of income per capita. The paper notes use of historical
    standard deviation of rainfall measures from 1979-2019.
  6: "The analysis identifies statistically significant effects from two measures:\
    \ the number of wet days RD(1\u2009mm)x,y and the measure of extreme daily rainfall\
    \ RD\u02C6(99.9%)x,y. The number of wet days has a quadratic effect."
  7: The paper calculates percentage-point effects on subnational growth rates from
    a one-unit increase in each rainfall measure. It also uses within-region standard
    deviations to assess the magnitude of historical effect sizes.
  8: "Maps show historical (1979\u20132019) means of four rainfall measures. Scales\
    \ provided for each map: Annual total rainfall (0-4000 mm), Number of wet days\
    \ (0-365), Extreme daily rainfall (percent of historical mean).  Monthly Rainfall\
    \ Deviations uses a unitless scale summarizing deviations from usual patterns."
  9: Maps show historical standard deviations of annual values (1979-2019) for four
    rainfall measures, with the scale ranging from 0 to over 500 mm for annual total
    rainfall.

    deviation change) for different rainfall metrics across the agricultural, manufacturing,
    and service sectors.
  12: The table presents regression coefficients indicating the %-point effect on
    economic growth rates per unit increase in the given measure. Standard errors
    for these coefficients are also provided.
