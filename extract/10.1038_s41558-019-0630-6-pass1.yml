Drivers of Risk:
  3: Increasingly stronger impact on GPP by extreme droughts than mild and moderate
    droughts over the 21st century.
  5: Droughts defined by low Plant Accessible Soil Water (PASW)
  6: Increased frequency and intensity of drought events under RCP8.5 scenario, with
    high risks for areas like the Amazon, South Africa, Mediterranean Basin, Australia,
    and southwest USA.
  7: Emission scenarios RCP8.5 and RCP4.5, changes in environmental drivers including
    PASW, temperature, humidity and radiation, and vegetation states.
  8: Increased frequency and intensity of droughts, specifically extreme droughts
  9: Drought-induced stress impacts vegetation and potentially the global carbon cycle;
    CO2 fertilization and climate variability impact Gross Primary Production (GPP).
  12: Droughts defined by PASW impact the productivity of plants, as plant drought
    tolerance depends on historical climate conditions.
  14: Droughts, influenced by climate variables such as temperature, humidity, radiation,
    precipitation, and PASW (Precipitation minus Actual Soil Water) are the drivers
    of risk.
  19: Droughts
Highlights:
  3: Extreme droughts are projected to significantly reduce global gross primary production
    (GPP) by the end of the century, with the magnitude of GPP reduction nearly tripling
    compared to historical levels.
  5: Extreme droughts are projected to become significantly more frequent under future
    climate scenarios.
  6: Increased impact of drought upon GPP is mainly due to increased frequency of
    drought events; extreme droughts lead to much larger GPP reductions than moderate
    or mild droughts.
  7: Extreme droughts will contribute a larger proportion of total GPP reduction in
    the future. CO2 fertilization and higher temperatures will increase globally-averaged
    GPP, but the increase is less significant for extreme droughts.
  8: Extreme droughts are projected to cause a doubled percentage reduction in GPP.
    The impact of drought on GPP is projected to be much larger in tropical and temperate
    regions and smaller at high latitudes. The study projects a larger increase in
    the magnitude of drought-associated reduction in GPP for tropical and temperate
    regions.
  9: The potential risk that extreme droughts might significantly impact GPP could
    be mitigated by positive anomalies in GPP due to favorable environmental conditions.
  14: The study identifies that drought-associated GPP reduction could plausibly extend
    past the end of the duration of drought defined based on soil moisture, potentially
    underestimating drought impacts. GPP impacts can be attributed to different climate
    variables and vegetation states.
  19: The study projects spatial distribution of GPP anomalies associated with droughts
    during 2075-2099, indicating areas where GPP reduction is projected to be larger
    or smaller than the historical average.
Methodology:
  3: Analyzed outputs of 13 Earth System Models (ESMs).
  5: Analysis based on deviations of GPP from the mean for each month of a specific
    location during 1850-2099. Droughts classified into extreme, moderate, and mild
    based on PASW percentiles. Projections based on grid-cell-, model-, and month-specific
    historical simulations. Results applicable to 2075-2099.
  6: Analysis of drought-related reductions in Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) using
    ensemble mean projections for future periods.
  7: Earth system model projections were used to project future GPP under different
    emission scenarios. Statistical significance was assessed using p-values.
  8: The study projects the impact of drought on Gross Primary Productivity (GPP)
    for the years 2075-2099 relative to the historical period of 1850-1999 under different
    emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5).
  12: Selected 13 ESM simulations from CMIP5 archive using criteria of reported soil
    water at depths and GPP; analyzed under RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 emission scenarios;
    defined droughts using PASW as an indicator, evaluated historical drought conditions
    from 1850-1999 to project drought impacts from 2000-2099.
  14: Statistical tests were used to test for significant differences in drought risks
    and associated GPP reductions. Multilinear regressions were fitted to understand
    the importance of different climate variables and vegetation states on GPP reductions
    associated with droughts.
  19: Uses an ensemble of 13 Earth system models to project GPP anomalies associated
    with droughts during 2075-2099 relative to 1850-1999. Bootstrap sampling is used
    to test the significance of the changes.
More Notes:
  3: The paper suggests that positive anomalies of GPP associated with favorable environmental
    conditions can potentially mitigate the risk of extreme droughts to the global
    carbon cycle.
  5: The paper defines droughts using PASW and considers the impact on GPP, particularly
    at sites that would usually be wet.
  7: The study examines GPP reduction in the context of rising GPP due to CO2 fertilization.
    The percentage reduction in GPP due to droughts is not projected to change significantly
    under RCP 8.5.
  8: The beneficial impact of higher CO2 concentrations on plant production during
    moderate and mild droughts could result in a lower percentage reduction in GPP
    under RCP 8.5 relative to RCP 4.5.

Quantitative material:
  3: "The magnitude of globally-averaged reductions in GPP associated with extreme\
    \ droughts was projected to be nearly tripled by the last quarter of this century\
    \ (2075\u20132099) relative to that of the historical period (1850\u20131999)\
    \ under both high and intermediate greenhouse gas emission scenarios."
  5: Frequency of extreme droughts projected to increase by a factor of ~3.8 (p <
    0.001) under RCP 8.5 and ~3.1 (p < 0.001) under RCP 4.5 during 2075-2099 compared
    to 1850-1999. Frequency of moderate droughts projected to increase by ~1.2 (not
    significant) under RCP 8.5 and ~1.5 (p < 0.01) under RCP 4.5 during 2075-2099
    compared to 1850-1999.
  6: "Forecasted mean reductions in global GPP due to droughts will rise from ~2.8\
    \ Pg C per year during 1850\u20131999 to ~4.5 and ~4.7 Pg C per year during 2075\u2013\
    2099 under emission scenarios RCP8.5 and RCP4.5, respectively."
  7: "Extreme droughts are projected to increase GPP reduction contribution from ~28%\
    \ (1850-1999) to ~56% and 49% (2075-2099) under RCP 8.5 and RCP4.5, respectively.\
    \ Globally-averaged mean GPP is projected to be ~50% and ~31% higher for 2075\u2013\
    2099 compared to 1850\u20131999 under RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5, respectively."
  8: "The frequency of droughts is projected to increase from ~1.8% per year during\
    \ 1850\u20131999 to ~2.3% per year in 2075\u20132099. The percentage reduction\
    \ in GPP was projected to be doubled under extreme droughts under both emission\
    \ scenarios RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5."
  14: "Multilinear regressions were fitted to estimated GPP deviations with explanatory\
    \ variables of PASW, daily temperature, incoming solar radiation, relative humidity,\
    \ and mean GPP for all the drought events for a specific month for the 25-year\
    \ periods during 1850\u20132099."
  19: GPP anomalies are expressed relative to the historical period (1850-1999). Values
    < -1 indicate a larger GPP reduction than the historical period, while values
    > -1 indicate a smaller reduction.
