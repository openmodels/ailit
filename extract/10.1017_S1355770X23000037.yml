Highlights:
  3: Long-term exposure to extreme temperatures can negatively impact mental health
    (depression) of adults over 45.
  6: "This study aims to estimate the magnitude of slow-moving, climate-caused adversities\
    \ on individuals\u2019 depression symptoms."
  13: Key finding is the average change in depression symptoms when exposed to an
    additional extreme temperature day.
  14: Long-term exposure to local extreme temperatures has significant adverse impacts
    on the depression symptoms of middle-aged and elderly people in China. The magnitude
    of the impact of cold exposure is almost two times higher than that of heat exposure.
  15: Access to AC mitigates the effect of hot exposure on depression; Access to heating
    mitigates the effect of cold exposure on depression.
  18: Local cold exposure poses more threats to women's mental health than men's,
    highlighting the mental vulnerability of women to the threat of extreme temperatures.
  20: The adverse impact of local extreme temperature on rural populations is more
    pronounced.
  25: Extreme temperature has a long-term and accumulative cost on middle-aged and
    elderly human capital. Adaptive tools are necessary for mitigating the adverse
    effects of extreme temperatures.

  32: Temperature effects on mortality and household adaptation in China
  36: ln(PCE) is statistically significant in three models.
  43: The chart indicates that heat and cold exposure affect males and females differently,
    as measured by the CES-D score.
  46: Heat and cold exposure days are associated with increased depression scores,
    with heterogeneous effects across age, gender, and urban/rural residence.
Methodology:
  3: Analysis using the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study and environmental
    data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from 2011 to
    2015, controlling for city, year, and individual fixed effects.
  6: This study investigates the cumulatively causal relationship between extreme
    temperature and depression symptoms, particularly those of the vulnerable elderly,
    by constructing a linear probability model.
  11: Regression analysis controlling for wind speed, sunshine duration, relative
    humidity, air pressure, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Focuses on the overall
    effects of long-term cumulative exposures to extreme temperatures.
  13: Three years of unbalanced panel data from CHARLS using a fixed-effect model
    considering individual, city, and year-specific effects.
  14: Regression analysis controlling for fixed effects at the city, individual, and
    year levels.
  15: Subsample analysis of populations with and without AC/heating to estimate the
    size of the mitigation effect of these technologies
  20: Regression analysis using a sample restricted to non-migrants and using alternative
    measurements of extreme temperature to verify robustness.
  26: No relevant information
  32: Empirical analysis using data from China
  36: 'Fixed-effects models are used, including individual-, year-, and city- fixed
    effects, with standard errors clustered at the county/community level. Significance
    levels are indicated: *** (1%), ** (5%), * (10%). The data source is CHARLS 2011,
    2013, 2015 Survey Data.'
  39: The analysis uses regression models to estimate the impact of nonlinear temperature
    indicators on an unspecified outcome variable. The models also include interaction
    terms with air conditioning (AC) and heating.
  43: The analysis uses data from the CHARLS 2011, 2013, and 2015 surveys. Models
    include control variables, individual-, year-, and city-fixed effects, and standard
    errors are clustered at the county/community level. The coefficient represents
    the effect of heat/cold exposure days on CES-D score for each gender.
  46: Fixed effects models with individual-, year-, and city-fixed effects, with standard
    errors clustered at the county/community level. Models include unspecified control
    variables. Results are applicable to the population surveyed in CHARLS 2011, 2013,
    2015 Survey Data.

  3: Air conditioning and heating equipment can alleviate the adverse impact of heat
    and cold exposure.
  6: The study focuses on the relationship between extreme temperature and depression
    symptoms, which may indirectly relate to macroeconomic outcomes through productivity
    loss.

    (CHARLS).
  14: This paper focuses on the mental health impacts of climate change, specifically
    depression symptoms, in middle-aged and elderly people in China. The paper provides
    an empirical comparison of the effects of heat exposure and cold exposure.
  15: This page focuses on individual health (somatic activity and depression) rather
    than macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level.
  18: The paper suggests women are more vulnerable to mental health impacts from climate
    change due to limited information access, resources, and decision-making power,
    particularly in developing countries.
  20: The paper focuses on rural populations in China and their vulnerability to temperature
    changes. It does not focus on national-level adaptation costs or benefits.
