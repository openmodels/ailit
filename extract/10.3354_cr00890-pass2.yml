Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate variability
  32: Implied climate change impacts affecting fisheries, leading to changes in catch
    and landings.
  33: The 'Leakages' (rest of the world, savings...) indicate potential outflows that
    could dampen the economic impact within Victoria.
  34: Unspecified shocks impacting direct, induced, and indirect effects, impacting
    expenditure and coefficient of induction.
  36: ENSO, Season (High/Low), Time Trend
Highlights:
  34: The graph shows the evolution of expenditure and the coefficient of induction
    from 1992 to 2006, broken down into direct, induced, and indirect effects.
  36: No relevant information
Methodology:
  2: Working paper; no specific methodology is mentioned on this page.
  33: The diagram appears to illustrate a simplified input-output model tracing the
    flow of money through different sectors (public, private, households) in Victoria,
    stimulated by expenditure from the tuna fishing fleet.
  34: Analysis of direct, induced, and indirect effects on expenditure, with calculation
    of a 'Coef. of induction', across the years 1992-2006; the expenditure is measured
    using 'MSR 2001'.
  35: Factor analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify
    underlying factors that explain the variance in a set of variables. A biplot is
    used to visualize the relationships between variables and factors.
  36: Diagram of flowchart or timeline possibly showing relationship among several
    variables, mathematical differentiation.
More Notes:
  2: This paper seems to focus on a specific sector (tuna economy) within Seychelles.
    It might contribute to understanding climate-related sectoral impacts, but it's
    unclear from this page if it directly addresses nation-wide macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes.
  33: The model highlights the interconnectedness of different sectors and potential
    leakage points that could affect the overall economic impact of the tuna fishing
    fleet's expenditure.
  34: The term 'MSR 2001' is likely an acronym, requiring further investigation to
    determine its exact meaning and the units of measurement for expenditure.
  35: The specific context and meaning of the variables listed (Electserv, Water,
    Telephone, etc.) are unknown without additional information. Therefore, their
    relevance to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks of climate change adaptation
    cannot be determined.
  36: The page contains a timeline diagram that likely shows the interaction of ENSO,
    seasonal factors, and time trend. The mathematical derivation may represent the
    rate of change of some relevant variable. However, the lack of context prevents
    identifying any specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
