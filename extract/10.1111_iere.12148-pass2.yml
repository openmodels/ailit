  17: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  2: Uncertainty regarding future climate conditions affects the design of infrastructure
    contracts.
  3: Changing weather conditions; deep current scientific uncertainty regarding future
    climate conditions; increasing likelihood of very large catastrophic events.
  4: Anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) concentration leading to local extreme events,
    such as heat waves, floodings and precipitations; climate change impacts on precipitations,
    rivers and glacial runoffs, drought and floods.
  6: Uncertainty on climate shocks; irreversible investments; productivity shocks
  8: Uncertainty in the success of the initial investment which impacts the social
    value of the project.
  9: Uncertain climate shocks affect the second-period probability of the project
    generating social value, linked to a productivity shock due to climate change.
  13: "Productivity shock \u03B8; Discount factor \u03B4 (representing myopia)"
  17: Uncertainty surrounding climate change, specifically the timing of productivity
    shocks.
  25: "Climate shocks (represented by the productivity shock \u03B8) affect productivity.\
    \ The level of exposure to these shocks is determined by the technological choice\
    \ (\u03B1)."
  26: "Distribution of the productivity shock \u03B8 (related to climate shocks),\
    \ discount factor \u03B4 (related to project duration, financial constraints,\
    \ political uncertainty), and the firm\u2019s elasticity of effort supply \u03B5\
    (t)."
  28: Climate change related hazards impacting infrastructure sectors; climate uncertainty.
  29: Climate hazards might impact growth rates by putting long-lived assets at risk
    and affecting contracts and investments in infrastructure sectors.
Highlights:
  2: This sheds a pessimistic light on the relevance of Public-Private Partnerships
    in sectors sensitive to changing weather conditions.
  3: Long-term contracting is plagued with new agency costs of delegated flexibility
    that may be better controlled when parties wait until uncertainty on climate conditions
    is resolved to draft new arrangements; offers a rather pessimistic view on the
    benefit of PPPs in that context.
  4: Climate change introduces uncertainty in long-term economic decisions due to
    uncertainty in future environmental parameters. Developing countries with large
    infrastructure needs are expected to experience stronger climate change impacts.
    Climate-related hazards are especially relevant for infrastructure. Long-lived
    infrastructure investments will have to cope with a broader range of climatic
    conditions.
  6: Climate change uncertainty exacerbates the agency problem between the public
    and private sectors, leading to underinvestment in the earlier period to maintain
    flexibility for the future; firm's incentives to keep flexibility for the second
    period dampens its first-period effort.
  13: "Less myopic principals reduce first-period investment to gain flexibility,\
    \ delaying effort provision until the productivity shock \u03B8 is known; The\
    \ threshold value of the productivity shock below which an earlier commitment\
    \ is binding is below the mean."
  17: With stationary contracts, the environment behaves as if it were stationary,
    with an 'average' effort supply determining the probability of success in each
    period.
  20: "Non-stationary policies (increasing or decreasing incentives over time) may\
    \ be optimal depending on the elasticity of effort supply; the optimal contract\
    \ (t\u22171(\u03B4),t\u22172(\u03B4) = \u03B3\u2217(\u03B4)t\u22171(\u03B4)) depends\
    \ on whether the elasticity of effort is non-decreasing, non-increasing, or stationary."
  22: The paper finds that unbundling tasks may decrease first-period agency costs
    because bundling tasks increases the firm's incentives for flexibility, causing
    part of the first-period reward to be dissipated.
  25: "The firm chooses less flexibility (higher \u03B1, meaning lower exposure to\
    \ climate risks) as \u03B1 increases. In other words, firms will invest more in\
    \ climate-resilient technologies if those technologies are more readily available\
    \ and/or affordable. A lower-\u03B1 technology (less costly) implies more uncertainty\
    \ regarding the productivity shock \u03B8."
  26: Investing in a technology that reduces uncertainty is optimal and may substitute
    for long-term contracts. Longer project duration or more exposure to adverse climate
    shocks exacerbate the value of keeping flexibility.
  28: Climate uncertainty modifies underinvestment effects in PPPs due to new agency
    costs. The optimal reward profiles in PPPs depend on the elasticity of effort
    supply. Decreasing incentives (like BOT or BOO models) may be suitable for water
    and energy production PPPs. Short-term contracts, unbundling tasks, and flexible
    technologies can help reduce agency costs. Careful analysis is needed for the
    joint design of institutional, contractual, and technological constraints.
  29: The paper highlights the need to understand how financial and regulatory constraints
    may impact investments and adoption of new technologies in infrastructure sectors.

    \ under certain conditions."
Methodology:
  2: Analysis performed in a principal-agent context with dynamic moral hazard, limited
    liability, and irreversibility constraints.
  3: Model of long-term contracting tailored to the specificities that climate change
    brings to the agency relationship between public bodies and firms.
  6: Agency model with principal (public sector) and agent (private sector) considering
    different scenarios corresponding to various degrees of contractual incompleteness;
    two period relationship.
  8: The paper develops a two-stage principal-agent model of a public-private partnership
    (PPP) contract for the provision of a public service, such as energy, water, sanitation,
    or transportation. The model analyzes the agency relationship between the government
    and the private firm and characterizes optimal contracts based on a trade-off
    between a Commitment Effect and a Flexibility Effect.
  9: The analysis uses an intertemporal irreversibility constraint to model efforts
    in two periods, influenced by agency theory and standard irreversibility literature.
  13: Mathematical model of investment and effort provision under uncertainty, comparing
    myopic and less myopic principals.
  17: The analysis uses a principal-agent model with stationary contracts to investigate
    potential distortions arising from uncertainty in the timing of climate change
    impacts. It examines how the principal (e.g., a government) and the agent (e.g.,
    individuals or businesses) agree on the optimal level of flexibility in adaptation
    efforts.
  20: The paper analyzes optimal long-term contracts with non-stationary policies
    using a principal-agent framework, considering Commitment and Flexibility Effects.
  22: The paper uses a principal-agent model with two periods to analyze the optimal
    contract design for climate change adaptation efforts, focusing on the trade-offs
    between flexibility and incentives. It considers long-term contracts (bundling)
    versus short-term contracts (unbundling) and the impact of uncertainty.
  25: "The paper uses a theoretical model to analyze technological choices in the\
    \ context of climate change. It considers a continuum of potential technologies\
    \ indexed by a parameter \u03B1, which characterizes the level of exposure to\
    \ a productivity shock \u03B8. The model analyzes the trade-off between the cost\
    \ of adopting a less risky technology and the potential impact of climate shocks\
    \ on productivity. The analysis is restricted to the case of stationary contracts."
  26: Theoretical model analyzing optimal technology and contracting choices under
    climate uncertainty.
  28: Theoretical modeling of agency costs arising from climate uncertainty in long-term
    contracts like PPPs; analysis of the firm's effort supply elasticity.
  29: The approach to the problem of delegated flexibility is largely normative, with
    aspirations to account for evolving preferences of the government and renegotiation
    of objectives.

    \ inequality (31) and an assumption (v\u2032\u2032\u22640) under a condition Proposition\

More Notes:
  3: Focuses on Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in sectors involving Long-Lived
    Capital Stock (LLKS) such as transport, water and sewage, and energy networks.
  4: The coarse spatial resolution of climate models limits climate risk assessments
    for specific businesses.
  6: The analysis identifies a Commitment Effect (how a lower first-period effort
    affects agency costs in both periods) and a Flexibility Effect (the sensitivity
    of a second-period effort to incentives when the earlier commitment is not binding).
  8: The paper uses a discount factor to represent the time value of money for both
    the government and the private firm. It also considers the cost to the agent of
    exerting effort in the first period, which affects the probability of project
    success.
  13: "The principal's bias towards keeping flexibility exists even without agency\
    \ problems; As the discount factor \u03B4 increases, the principal underinvests\
    \ more."
  20: The paper relates the concepts of increasing and decreasing incentives to real-world
    Public-Private Partnership (PPP) contracts like BOT and BOO, respectively.
  22: The analysis suggests that limiting contract length in uncertain environments
    (short-term contracts) can be beneficial, highlighting a novel cost of Public-Private
    Partnerships (PPPs).
  29: The full consequences of the channel between climate and growth remain to be
    studied, and future research is intended to explore this.
