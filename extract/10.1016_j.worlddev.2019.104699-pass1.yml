Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on African countries' economic development, climate-induced
    losses, exposure, vulnerability, and hazards related to climate change.
  2: Climate variability and change, including precipitation (droughts and flooding)
    and temperature fluctuations.
  4: Temperature deviation from historical mean, Standardized Precipitation Index
    (SPI).
  5: Precipitation (categorized into extreme & severe dry, moderately dry, near normal
    dry, normal dry, normal wet, near normal wet, moderately wet, and extreme & severe
    wet), temperature (linear and squared)
  6: Temperature deviation from historical mean, Precipitation intensity (measured
    using SPI)
  7: Climate variability, specifically precipitation and temperature fluctuations,
    and the limited adaptation of African countries to these fluctuations.
  8: Changes in precipitation and temperature induced by future climate change.
  9: Low warming (RCP2.6) and high warming (RCP8.5) scenarios.
  10: Climate variability and change, specifically a high warming (RCP8.5) scenario
    compared to a low warming (RCP2.6) scenario.
  12: Current emission trends

Highlights:
  1: Climate change detrimentally affects African economies; Western and Eastern African
    countries are projected to be the most affected; inequalities between countries
    are projected to widen in high warming scenarios compared to low and without warming
    scenarios; most African economies are poorly adapted to their current climate;
    need for mitigation ambition, addressing adaptation deficit, integrating climate
    risks in economic and development planning, and special treatment for vulnerable
    countries in climate-related finance.
  2: The study aims to understand the historical vulnerability of African economies
    to precipitation and temperature fluctuations and to estimate the extent to which
    countries are adapted to their current climatic conditions.
  4: The model generates 10 macroeconomic risk effect estimates for every year, country
    and scenario, allowing for sensitivity and distribution analysis of the results.
    External debt and remittances have a negative influence on income per capita.
  5: Squared temperature has a statistically significant positive impact on GDP per
    capita for the 1-year lag, 5-year lag, and 10-year lag.
  6: Increased temperature deviations are correlated with a negative impact on GDP
    per capita growth across most African regions. The sensitivity of GDP growth to
    precipitation changes varies considerably across different regions.
  7: The lack of adaptation to current climatic conditions is already negatively affecting
    economic development in African countries. Precipitation has a greater influence
    than temperature on GDP per capita in the period 1980-2014. Resource-rich countries,
    those with strong service sectors, or those with diversified economies experienced
    the least loss.
  8: The effects of future changes on precipitation and temperature may adversely
    affect GDP per capita growth in every African region. Western Africa and Eastern
    Africa are projected to be the most affected regions in both warming scenarios.
    High warming would have particularly severe consequences on African economies
    as the regional macroeconomic risks are almost twice as high as in the low warming
    scenario by 2050.
  9: Inequalities between African countries are projected to decrease at a lower rate
    in high warming scenario, delaying convergence.
  10: Mitigation action has early benefits, with economic impacts between warming
    scenarios diverging in the 2030s. High warming scenario leads to significantly
    worse economic outcomes by 2050. African countries are poorly adapted to current
    climatic conditions. There is delayed convergence in the Gini and Atkinson inequality
    indices, particularly in the high warming scenario.
  12: Current emission trends would lead to detrimental social and economic impacts,
    severely hampering African countries' capacity to adapt and cope with climate
    change, leading to a further increase in losses and preventing the achievement
    of a sustainably developed world without poverty.

Methodology:
  1: Economic model embedding three dimensions of risks (exposure, vulnerability,
    and hazards) at the country level to analyze convergence considering climate change
    damages.
  2: The paper develops a model that dynamically satisfies the three dimensions of
    disaster and climate risks by considering exposure, vulnerability, and hazards;
    country-level analysis of climate-related disaster impacts and climate change
    is performed between 2015 and 2050 under low and high warming scenarios.
  4: Panel regression is employed for African countries from 1980 to 2014, calibrated
    for each country to address potential bias due to differences in GDP per capita.
    Projections up to 2050 are realized using sensitivity coefficients inferred by
    the regression model and subsequent calibration. The analysis considers five Global
    Circulation Models (GCM) from the CMIP5 database.
  5: Panel regression analysis with Newey-West heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation
    corrected (HAC) standard errors. NCEP population-weighted precipitation and temperature
    data are used. Time lags of 0, 1, 5, and 10 years are considered.
  6: The paper uses boxplots, interquartile ranges, whiskers (95% interval), and locally
    weighted scatterplot smoothing (loess) to illustrate the relationship between
    temperature/precipitation and GDP.
  7: Regression analysis to determine the sensitivity of GDP to extremely dry or wet
    events. Uses the ratio of effect standard deviation to measure the relative importance
    of climatic and socioeconomic parameters in explaining changes in GDP per capita.
    Estimates future climate-induced macroeconomic risk using optimal temperature
    and precipitation sensitivity coefficients filtered from a country-level model
    calibration and using two warming scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5).

    \ to estimate the impacts of changes in precipitation and temperature on African\
    \ countries\u2019 GDP per capita trajectories. Analyzes the effects of future\
    \ climate change on Africa\u2019s income convergence against the same SSP2 socioeconomic\
    \ baseline for GDP per capita growth using Gini and Atkinson indices."
  9: GDP per capita estimated for 2015-2050 using SSP2 as baseline.
  10: Analysis of historical and projected consequences of climate variability and
    change on economic development in African countries; includes projections of inequality
    indices (Gini and Atkinson) under different warming scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5)
    compared to a baseline. Econometric analysis relating to current climatic conditions
    for these countries is also referenced.

More Notes:
  1: Analysis raises issues on the ability of African countries to reach their SDGs
    targets, and the potential increasing risk of instability and migration.
  2: "The paper aims to improve the scientific understanding of the consequences of\
    \ climate-related disasters on African countries\u2019 economic development and\
    \ its relevance to policy planning in development and adaptation to climate change."
  5: The sensitivity of GDP per capita to the occurrence of severely-extremely dry
    events is lower in comparison to the sensitivity to severely-extremely wet events.
  6: The analysis is specific to Africa and highlights regional differences in climate
    impact. The SPI is used to show precipitation intensity levels from 'severely
    & extremely dry' to 'severely & extremely wet'.
  7: The impact of extreme wet events may have a positive impact after 10 years due
    to capital destruction and reconstruction.
  8: The study notes that the projected economic risks may potentially underestimate
    the economic risks as the lagged consequences on GDP per capita are not accounted
    for in the projections. The study also examines the effect of future climate change
    on African income convergence.
  9: Countries with large agricultural populations may be particularly affected by
    climate change, while resource-rich countries with resilient economic structures
    are projected to be less affected.
  10: The paper focuses on African countries and emphasizes the need for stringent
    mitigation policies, revision of NDCs, and revision of economic models used to
    estimate the Social Cost of Carbon. The analysis highlights an adaptation deficit
    in African countries.

    growth in Africa.
  3: In Western Africa, the number of lost working days due to high temperature could
    increase by 3.4 percentage points in the 2050s in a high warming scenario (SRES
    A2), from an already high 40.3 percent of lost days per year.
  4: GDP per capita deviation is computed in RCP8.5 (high warming) and RCP2.6 (low
    warming) scenarios from 2015 to 2050.
