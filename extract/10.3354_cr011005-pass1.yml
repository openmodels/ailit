Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea-level rise due to anthropogenic global warming, leading to land loss, increased
    flooding, and salinisation.
  3: Sea-level rise and its interaction with coastal morphology, topography, and human
    modifications; the potential increase or decrease in tropical cyclone strength
    and track is also considered a risk.
  5: Sea-level rise; Storm surge; Wetland loss.
  6: Sea-level rise and its impacts on coastal flooding and wetland loss are major
    drivers of risk.
  7: Relative sea-level rise (10 cm rise in sea level by 2050).
  8: Sea-level rise, rapid population growth, local subsidence and sediment starvation
    (in the Niger delta).
  10: Sea-level rise, increased population density, human modifications to the coast
    such as clearing mangroves and damaging coral reefs.
  12: Sea-level rise, climate change, non-climate-change factors
Highlights:
  1: Regional cooperation is beneficial for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and
    adopting adaptive solutions to climate change impacts.
  3: Deltas, small islands, deltaic settings, and coastal ecosystems are identified
    as particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise.
  5: Vulnerability is classified into low, medium, high, and critical classes based
    on different impact categories (people affected, people at risk, capital value
    loss, land loss, protection/adaptation costs, and wetland loss).
  7: Protection of the entire coast may be justified at an aggregated scale, but abandoning
    some areas may be optimal at a disaggregated scale, even with moderate sea-level
    rise.
  8: West Africa appears vulnerable to accelerated sea-level rise. Significant land
    loss in Senegal, Nigeria, and Benin. Large population displacement, particularly
    in Nigeria. High capital value loss in Nigeria. Adaptation costs also are significant.
  10: The Pacific Small Islands appear to be highly vulnerable to sea-level rise due
    to a range of physical, social and cultural factors. There are no winners given
    sea-level rise, rather there are small losers and big losers.
  12: Regional perspective provides a useful link between research and policy at the
    national and global scales; Improvement of data collection and management is another
    necessity to improve future vulnerability and adaptation assessments.
Methodology:
  1: Regional analyses using local and national assessments of relative vulnerability
    for selected regions.
  3: The paper discusses the use of the IPCC Common Methodology for assessing societal
    vulnerability to sea-level rise and mentions the development of IPCC technical
    guidelines tailored for coastal regions.
  5: Global vulnerability analysis (GVA) applied at a global scale, with national
    scale calculations aggregated to regional and global scales, using 1990 and 2020
    socio-economic scenarios. Factors evaluated included flooding due to storm surge,
    potential protection costs, and wetland loss.
  7: Analysis of protection in East Anglia, England, evaluating individual flood compartments.
    Economic analysis of Turner et al. (1995) suggests suitable sites for managed
    retreat.
  8: The information summarizes three studies from 1995 on Senegal, Benin, and Nigeria,
    considering a 1m sea-level rise and the 1990s socioeconomic situation. Assessments
    from Bijlsma et al. (1996) also. Impacts might be more significant given the rapid
    population growth of the region.
  12: National studies are useful for validating regional impact models; Regional
    coordinated efforts to assess vulnerability and responses within an ICZM context
    are worthwhile.
More Notes:
  3: The paper notes barriers to comprehensive impact and response analyses due to
    factors such as incomplete knowledge of relevant processes, insufficient data,
    and difficulties in developing local and regional scenarios.
  6: The focus is on assessing regional vulnerability to sea-level rise across four
    regions, with specific attention to adaptation costs in different European countries.
  7: The Netherlands has a national law outlawing erosion and mandating maintenance
    of the present shoreline position, but managed retreat is also being considered.
  8: Estimates are based on the 1990s socioeconomic situation and a 1m sea level rise,
    and population growth could amplify impacts. Protection may remove most of the
    direct human impact in Senegal and most people in Nigeria might be protected,
    except for the Niger delta region where 600,000 might require relocation.

    \ responses are appropriate in the next few decades."

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  5: Protection/adaptation costs relative to GNP; Capital value loss relative to GNP.
  7: Protection can be justified for the entire coast of East Anglia, England, but
    20% of individual flood compartments would optimally be abandoned even with a
    10 cm sea level rise by 2050.
  8: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes quantified, but land loss, population
    displacement, capital value loss, and adaptation/protection costs are mentioned.
  10: Local people would evacuate from villages where they have historically lived,
    which in turn causes a loss of traditional culture and social instability. Accelerated
    sea-level rise and climate change could also affect modern infrastructure, including
    ports, harbours and coastal resorts. Protection of people and the economy needs
    to be balanced against the costs of degradation of the coastal environment.
  12: Assessment of impacts of sea-level rise
Quantitative material:
  5: Vulnerability classes defined by thresholds for people affected (% of total population),
    people at risk (flood probability), capital value loss (% of 1990 GNP), land loss
    (% of total area), protection/adaptation costs (% of 1990 GNP), and wetland loss
    (% of total area).
  7: 'East Anglia: 20% of flood compartments would optimally be abandoned with a 10
    cm sea level rise by 2050.'
  8: Land loss (km2 and % of country), population affected (thousands and % of population),
    capital value loss (million US$ and % GNP), adaptation/protection costs (million
    US$ and % GNP) are quantified for Senegal, Nigeria and Benin under a 1m sea level
    rise in the 1990s socioeconomic situation.
  10: About two-thirds of sites in Tuvalu would be inundated by a 1 m rise in sea
    level.
