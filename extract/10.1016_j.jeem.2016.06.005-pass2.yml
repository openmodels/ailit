    impacting cereal yields.
  28: Temperature and agricultural dependence.
  29: Temperature and precipitation changes.

    The percentage of agriculture, value added in GDP
Highlights:
  2: Temperature increases are associated with increased out-migration from agriculture-dependent
    countries. Climate-driven cereal yield shocks significantly affect outmigration
    in agricultural countries.
  3: Temperature has positive effects on outmigration only in agricultural countries;
    migration flows to major destinations are most temperature sensitive; policies
    should focus on agriculture-dependent countries
  7: Adverse climate change (specifically temperature increases) triggers more out-migration
    for agriculture-dependent countries.
  8: Temperature increases in agricultural-dependent countries lead to outmigration;
    temperature may have some lagged effects on outmigration; existing co-ethnic networks
    play a role in migration flows.
  11: Cereal yields are found to be negatively associated with outmigration only in
    the top 25% agricultural countries.
  13: Temperature has positive and statistically significant effects on outmigration,
    but only from agriculture-dependent countries; Climate-induced migration enlarges
    flow in already established migration routes.
  14: Agriculture is an important factor influencing climate-induced international
    migration.
  17: Climate change affects outmigration from the farm country (FC). Climate change
    impacts agricultural productivity (A) negatively. Climate change potentially reduces
    people's amenities in the FC. Change in outmigration caused by climate change
    depends on the magnitudes of the effect on agricultural productivity, effect on
    amenities, parameters describing relative factor productivity and output elasticities,
    and the responsiveness of migration decisions to amenities.
  28: Temperature and agricultural dependence have a statistically significant positive
    impact on migration flows, particularly in agriculture-dependent countries. The
    effect is robust to various controls and specifications.
  29: The interaction term between temperature and agriculture is statistically significant
    (p<0.01) in column (4), which includes destination countries with large migration
    stock from each origin country. Precipitation has a statistically significant
    (p<0.05) negative effect on migration in columns (1) and a statistically significant
    (p<0.05) positive effect on migration in column (3).
  30: In countries most dependent on agriculture, lower cereal yields are associated
    with higher outmigration rates. The 2SLS estimates (Panel B, column 4) are statistically
    significant at the 5% level. The negative coefficient in column 4 of Panel B suggests
    that a decrease in cereal yields leads to increased outmigration.
  31: Cereal yield decreases (likely due to climate change impacts) are associated
    with increased migration flows in agriculture-dependent countries. This result
    is robust to a range of specifications.
  34: Countries with a higher percentage of agriculture value added in GDP tend to
    have lower GDP per capita, lower cereal yields, higher monthly mean temperatures,
    and higher monthly total precipitation. Outmigration rates appear to be the highest
    for the second country group.
Methodology:
  2: Panel data analysis, instrumental variables approach, focusing on 163 origin
    countries and 42 OECD destination countries over three decades.
  3: Panel dataset analysis of international migration
  7: Reduced-form regression analysis, using country-pair fixed effects and origin
    and destination country specific linear time trends.
  8: Regression analysis with various control variables, regression techniques, dependent/independent
    variables, and samples; different thresholds for defining agricultural countries
    (33%, 25%, 20% agriculture value added in GDP).
  11: Fixed-effects two-stage least-squares (FE-2SLS) is used to estimate the relationship
    between cereal yields and international outmigration. Temperature and precipitation
    are used as instruments for cereal yields.
  13: Empirical approach quantifying the effects of weather variations on global bilateral
    international migration flows. Uses lagged weather variables and cereal yields
    in regressions. Uses top 25%, 33% and 20% agricultural countries for robustness
    checks.
  14: Reduced-form model and instrumental variables approach using comprehensive international
    migration dataset for the past three decades
  16: A theoretical model of migration between a small open economy (FC) and the rest-of-the-world
    (ROTW) is constructed. Utility maximization is used to derive an equilibrium condition
    for migration, which is then used to determine the total population in FC.
  17: The analysis uses a model with agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, labor
    market equilibrium, and climate impacts on agricultural productivity and amenities.
    The model's applicability is for understanding climate-driven outmigration from
    a region.
  20: "Fixed Effects (FE) 2SLS (Two-Stage Least Squares) regression model. First stage:\
    \ lnYit regressed on temperature and precipitation. Second stage: ln 1M \xB5it\
    \ regressed on predicted lnYit. Origin country-specific linear time trends are\
    \ included. Analysis aggregates outmigration to all destination countries for\
    \ each origin country."
  28: The analysis uses a reduced-form model and robustness checks. It controls for
    various factors, including lagged temperature and precipitation, lagged migration
    stock and rate, origin country-specific quadratic time trend, origin and destination
    country fixed effects, and origin country population. Robust standard errors are
    clustered by country pairs.
  29: The analysis uses a regression model with country-pair fixed effects and country-specific
    linear time trends to analyze migration patterns. The sample is split into quartiles
    based on the popularity of destination countries for each origin country based
    on migration stock. Robust standard errors clustered by country pairs are reported.
  30: The analysis uses fixed effects ordinary least squares (FE-OLS) and fixed effects
    two-stage least squares (FE-2SLS) regression. The sample is divided into four
    country groups based on the share of agriculture value added in GDP. Robust standard
    errors clustered by country are used.
  31: The analysis uses two-stage least squares (2SLS) and limited-information maximum
    likelihood (LIML) regressions with fixed effects (FE). Temperature and/or precipitation
    are used as instrumental variables for cereal yields. Robustness checks include
    using only temperature or precipitation as instruments, using lagged yield and
    climate variables, controlling for origin country GDP per capita, using the natural
    logarithm of migration flows, and restricting the sample to the top 33% or 20%
    agricultural countries.
  34: Countries are divided into four groups based on the share of agriculture value
    added in GDP (lower quartile, median, and upper quartile). Summary statistics
    are calculated for each group and for all countries combined.
More Notes:
  2: The sensitivity of outmigration to climate might be correlated to countries being
    poor.
  3: The paper focuses on international migration as a consequence of climate change,
    specifically temperature increases, and its relationship to agriculture. It doesn't
    directly address macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, but implies potential economic
    impacts due to labor migration from agricultural economies.
  7: The analysis focuses on current motivations for migration, which may inform projections
    of long-term climate change impacts. The outcome of interest here is migration,
    which may have macroeconomic consequences, but these are not directly investigated
    in this text.
  11: The F-statistics of the instruments are less than 10, which raises a concern
    for weak instruments.
  13: Average precipitation data at the country level may not be reliable. Income
    (GDP per capita) is used as an additional control variable. The use of the natural
    logarithm of migration flows as the dependent variable instead of migration rate
    yields consistent results. The threshold for agricultural dependence is not the
    key determining factor.
  14: Agricultural adaptation may reduce incentives to migrate; Diversifying livelihoods
    also has the potential to reduce migration; Policies should address the consequences
    of potential increases in immigration due to climate change.
  16: The model includes a production function relating capital, labor, agricultural
    productivity, and non-agricultural productivity to output.
  17: The model simplifies by assuming climate change only affects the agricultural
    sector directly. The authors acknowledge climate change could affect the non-agricultural
    sector as well.
  28: The dependent variable is the migration flow in most specifications but also
    is tested with the natural logarithm of migration flows. The interaction term
    between temperature and agricultural dependence captures the effect of temperature
    on migration specifically in agriculture-dependent countries.
  30: The study uses country fixed effects and country-specific time trends. The dependent
    variable is the natural logarithm of total outmigration rate from one country
    to all other countries.
  31: The reported coefficients are for the most agriculture-dependent countries.
    The table focuses on the top 25% agricultural countries, except for panels F and
    G, which use the top 33% and 20% respectively. Standard errors are clustered by
    country.

Quantitative material:
  2: "Each 1\xB0C increase in temperature implies a 5% increase in outmigration from\
    \ agricultural countries."
  3: No relevant information
  7: "Each 1 \xB0C increase in temperature implies a 5% increase in out-migration\
    \ from the top 25% agricultural countries (significant at the 1% level), as compared\
    \ to only 0.4% increase (statistically insignificant) in out-migration from non-agricultural\
    \ countries."
  8: Differential temperature effects for agricultural countries become larger in
    magnitude and more statistically significant when a higher threshold is set to
    identify agricultural countries (using agriculture value added in GDP share).
  11: Estimated elasticity of outmigration rate with respect to cereal yield in the
    top 25% agricultural countries is about -2.4. For a country with 0.1% annual outmigration
    rate, a 10% reduction in cereal yields would raise the annual out migration rate
    by around 24%, or to 0.124%.
  13: Temperature has positive and statistically significant effects on outmigration
    from agriculture-dependent countries.
  17: Equation 6 provides an expression for dN/dC, the change in outmigration with
    respect to climate change.
  20: "ln Yit (natural logarithm of cereal yields), ln 1M \xB5it (natural logarithm\
    \ of outmigration rate), \u03B21 (coefficient for temperature), \u03B2 (coefficient\
    \ for precipitation), \u03B3 (coefficient for cereal yields)."
  28: The table presents coefficients of the interaction term between temperature
    and agricultural dependence on migration flows for different definitions of agriculture-dependent
    countries (top 33%, 25%, and 20%). The coefficients range from 0.005 to 0.079,
    with standard errors in parentheses and significance levels indicated by asterisks
    (* p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01).
  29: "The table presents coefficients for temperature, temperature \xD7 agriculture,\
    \ precipitation, and precipitation \xD7 agriculture on migration, along with standard\
    \ errors, number of observations, number of ID's, and adjusted R-squared values."
  30: The table presents coefficients from regressions estimating the impact of the
    log of origin cereal yields on the log of total outmigration rate. For the most
    agriculture-dependent countries (column 4), a statistically significant negative
    relationship is found in both FE-OLS and FE-2SLS models.
  31: The table provides coefficients of cereal yields on migration flows in various
    regression specifications. Coefficients are consistently negative and statistically
    significant at the 5% level, with some specifications also significant at the
    10% level. The baseline coefficient is -2.405** with a standard error of 0.974.
  34: Provides summary statistics for total outmigration, average annual outmigration
    rate, GDP per capita, cereal yields, percentage of agriculture in GDP, monthly
    mean temperature, and monthly total precipitation across four country groups and
    all countries.
