Drivers of Risk:
  5: Drought conditions measured by the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration
    Index (SPEI) during the growing season are the primary drivers of risk being analyzed.
  10: Exposure to drought reduces willingness of households to acquire land and the
    price they are willing to pay; above-average water supply increases interest to
    purchase land.
  12: Shifts in seasonal precipitation patterns affected by climate change complicate
    prediction of rainy and growing seasons.
  14: SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index), poverty status,
    gender of household head, farm size.
  15: SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) which is an indicator
    of drought conditions, both current and lagged (up to 2 months).
  17: SPEI lagged and current effects are studied for dry, wet, and normal conditions.
Highlights:
  5: The study investigates how drought conditions, measured by SPEI, affect households'
    willingness to acquire full ownership rights to land and the amount they are willing
    to pay for it.
  10: Persistent effects of drought on land purchase willingness for up to two years;
    frequent droughts make regions less attractive for land purchases, warranting
    targeted efforts to improve land suitability.
  14: Current SPEI has a statistically significant positive effect on willingness
    to acquire land ownership rights. The effect of SPEI is heterogeneous based on
    poverty status, gender of head of household, and farm size, but many interaction
    effects are not statistically significant.
  15: Current and lagged SPEI values are statistically significant predictors of both
    willingness to purchase land and the amount households are willing to pay. The
    effect of SPEI varies depending on the lag structure and the specific dependent
    variable being considered.
  17: The analysis found significant within and between effects of SPEI across different
    conditions (dry, wet, normal) on willingness to purchase land and the amount households
    are willing to pay.
Methodology:
  5: "The study uses a panel data analysis (UNPS waves 2005/06, 2009/10, and 2010/11)\
    \ and links SPEI data to household locations based on GPS coordinates. The analysis\
    \ uses fixed effects for interview month. The paper estimates the effects of drought\
    \ during the growing season on households\u2019 willingness to purchase land using\
    \ regression equation (1): \U0001D44A\U0001D456\U0001D461= \U0001D6FD1\U0001D446\
    \U0001D443\U0001D438\U0001D43C\U0001D456\U0001D461+\U0001D6FD2\U0001D446\U0001D443\
    \U0001D438\U0001D43C\U0001D456\U0001D461\u22121 +\U0001D6FD3\U0001D446\U0001D443\
    \U0001D438\U0001D43C\U0001D456\U0001D461\u22122 +\U0001D6FF\U0001D44B\U0001D456\
    \U0001D461+\U0001D6FC\U0001D456+\U0001D6FE\U0001D461+\U0001D703\U0001D456\U0001D461\
    +\U0001D716\U0001D456\U0001D461. This equation appears to be at the household\
    \ level, implying the study is microeconomic."
  10: Household panel survey data combined with high-resolution weather data to calculate
    SPEI drought index; household fixed effects model exploiting variation in drought
    intensity across time and space.
  12: The paper uses simple approaches to define growing seasons for household locations
    and tests several alternative approaches.
  14: OLS regression with household fixed effects, wave fixed effects, and month fixed
    effects, clustered standard errors at the district level, and attrition weights
    applied. Data from UNPS waves 2005/06, 2009/10, and 2010/11. CHIRPS and CHIRTS
    data for precipitation and temperature.
  15: OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression is used to estimate the relationship
    between SPEI and willingness to purchase land/amount households are willing to
    pay, controlling for household fixed effects, wave fixed effects, and month fixed
    effects. Standard errors are clustered at the district level. Attrition weights
    are applied.
  17: Analysis is performed using Probit and Tobit correlated random effects models
    on UNPS and climate data sources.
More Notes:
  5: The study spatially links the SPEI to household locations based on GPS coordinates.
    They calculate SPEI values for each household location for the last month of the
    growing season based on the FAO crop calendar for Uganda. The dependent variables
    are self-reported survey answers. The study appears to focus on the impacts of
    climate (drought) on land tenure security at the household level.
  10: No relevant information
  12: Accurate identification of growing seasons is hindered by false starts and changes
    in rainfall patterns.
  14: The histogram shows the distribution of households' willingness to pay for land,
    which is heavily skewed towards lower amounts.
  17: The world does not find concrete macroeconomic or macro-fiscal data directly
    applicable to national adaptation costs or benefits.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  5: This paper focuses on the willingness of households to acquire full ownership
    rights to land and the amount they are willing to pay for it (in USh, adjusted
    for inflation).
  10: No relevant information
  14: Willingness to acquire land ownership rights.
  15: Willingness to purchase land; Amount households are willing to pay
  17: There is no specific mention of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes directly related
    to GDP effects, productivity loss, or public finances.
Quantitative material:
  5: Table 1 provides summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max, and
    N) for willingness to acquire land ownership, amount households are willing to
    pay for land, SPEI values (current and lagged), and several control variables
    such as household size, farm size, education, remittances, distance to parcels,
    number of parcels with use rights, household consumption expenditures, livestock
    units, and an asset index.
  10: No relevant information
  14: Regression results showing the impact of SPEI and interaction terms on willingness
    to acquire land ownership rights.
  15: The table provides regression coefficients for the relationship between SPEI
    and the dependent variables. For example, a current SPEI of 1 is associated with
    a 0.06 increase in willingness to purchase land (significant at the 5% level in
    column 1) and a 0.75 increase in the amount households are willing to pay (significant
    at the 5% level in column 5) using current SPEI.
  17: No concrete quantitative outcomes related to macro-fiscal measures or economic
    costs/benefits of adaptation are provided.
