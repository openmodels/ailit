Drivers of Risk:
  1: Warming temperatures, drought, and a slowing growth rate of CO2 will reduce land
    and ocean sinks and create new sources.
  3: Global temperature increases, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, ocean pH decline,
    sea level rise, global forest area decrease/increase. These are driven by fossil
    fuel emissions, cement production, and land-use emissions.
  5: Model disagreements regarding future ocean and land carbon uptake introduce significant
    uncertainty in carbon budget projections.
  7: Drought in the tropics during ENSO years, reducing plant growth and increasing
    plant mortality and wildfire, leads to significant impacts on CO2, which could
    indirectly impact macroeconomic outcomes.
  16: Rising temperatures and increased drought frequency in already-warm regions
    of the tropics are driving ecosystems toward unfavorable carbon balances.
  22: Uncertain land and ocean feedbacks; Concentration-dependent uptake slows; Climate
    impacts reduce uptake or cause land and ocean emissions; Warming temperatures;
    Limiting the growth rate of CO2.
Highlights:
  1: "International agreements aim to stabilize climate at 1.5\xB0 above preindustrial\
    \ levels, but feedbacks from the warmer climate will continue to cause carbon\
    \ sources."
  3: The paper highlights the challenges of mitigating emissions to avoid dangerous
    interference in the carbon cycle and to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.
    It also emphasizes that profound carbon cycle changes will occur along the path
    to mitigation of emissions, at net zero, and afterward as systems equilibrate
    to the new normal. The paper examines how carbon cycle processes will change as
    CO2 emissions level off and decline, and how feedbacks from the biogeophysical
    carbon cycle will affect the amount of anthropogenic carbon remaining in the atmosphere.
  5: The TCRE shows a linear relationship between cumulative emissions and warming,
    but there are uncertainties due to model physics and biogeochemistry.
  7: The tropics were clearly a net sink until the 2010s, but the increasing frequency
    of drought has weakened this sink.
  16: More of the world's ecosystems could be driven to unfavorable carbon balances
    by rising temperatures, with potential for tipping points in carbon cycles due
    to climate change.
  22: The Earth System currently absorbs about half of anthropogenic emissions, but
    this fraction will decline in the future; The size of the remaining carbon budget
    depends on highly uncertain land and ocean feedbacks; Model projections of the
    carbon budget during the transition to limiting climate change are highly uncertain;
    Current policy is based on ensemble average values, but data suggest the mean
    may not be the best estimate.
Methodology:
  3: Earth System Models (ESMs) are used, which include biogeophysical, biogeochemical,
    and human natural resource use processes. Observational knowledge of the carbon
    cycle from paleorecords to present-day experiments is used.
  5: The Transient Climate Response to Emissions (TCRE) framework is used to approximate
    the carbon budget, but results are uncertain due to model disagreements.
  7: "Satellite observation\u2013constrained estimates of exchange fluxes are used\
    \ to visualize NBE (the balance of ecosystems sinks and land-uses sources)."
  16: Analysis uses global data from local eddy covariance flux measurements to support
    theories about ecosystem carbon accumulation and potential temperature tipping
    points.
  22: Earth System models, data assimilation, and data science techniques are used
    to improve estimates of initial conditions, tune parameterizations, and identify
    model failures/inconsistencies.
More Notes:
  3: The paper acknowledges the importance of the global carbon budget and its role
    in understanding how Earth's biogeochemistry operates, even without spatial resolution.
    It mentions that emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere are consistently larger than
    accounted for by the atmospheric growth rate because of the removal of excess
    CO2 by oceans and terrestrial ecosystems.
  5: No relevant information
  7: The page focuses on the carbon cycle and its variability, particularly the role
    of the tropics and ENSO events. The increasing frequency of drought is presented
    as an important factor reducing the carbon sink capacity of tropical ecosystems.
  16: Changes to soil carbon, particularly in the far north, are challenging to predict
    and may be occurring faster than simulation models projected.
  22: Predictive capability will be crucial for managing ongoing long-term changes
    to land and ocean systems after achieving net-zero emissions.
