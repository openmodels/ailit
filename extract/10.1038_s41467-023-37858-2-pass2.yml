Drivers of Risk:
  2: Sea-level rise, reef erosion, reef degradation, and changes in reef-accretion
    capacity are drivers of coastal flooding risk.
  4: Sea-level rise; increased wave energy; erosion of reef elevation
  5: Sea-level rise, storm intensity (10-year and 50-year storm scenarios), reef erosion
    (loss of coral cover).
  6: Sea-level rise, storms, coral reef degradation (from climate change, SCTLD, physical
    erosion).
  8: "Sea-level rise; frequency of severe thermal-stress events and storms; impacts\
    \ of ocean acidi\uFB01cation; coral mortality; erosion"
Highlights:
  2: Reef erosion will result in a small, but measurable, increase in coastal flooding
    potential by the end of the century, although sea-level rise is the primary driver.
    Coral reef restoration could reduce the impacts of sea-level rise.
  4: Increasing Acropora palmata cover through restoration can improve reef-crest
    habitats' ability to keep pace with future sea-level rise and substantially reduce
    total water levels during future storms.
  5: Sea-level rise is the most significant driver of increased total water levels
    and thus flooding potential. Higher total water levels under all sea-level-rise
    scenarios are projected for the northern sector of the island, corresponding to
    the areas of greatest projected reef erosion.
  6: Reef erosion amplifies the impacts of sea-level rise on coastal flooding. Coral
    restoration can help mitigate these impacts by increasing reef complexity and
    wave breaking.
  8: "Reef restoration can increase reef elevation, helping to keep water depths at\
    \ the reef crest near the lowest predictions of sea-level rise for the end of\
    \ the century preventing wave-driven increases in coastal \uFB02ooding during\
    \ storms, even under pessimistic emissions-reduction scenarios; Restoration has\
    \ the potential to minimize climate-change impacts, while doing nothing to combat\
    \ erosion would amplify them; Substantial restoration efforts in the near term\
    \ could help combat the worst projected impacts of sea-level rise and resulting\
    \ coastal-\uFB02ooding risk by the end of the century, whereas allowing reef erosion\
    \ to continue unchecked could counteract progress from emissions reductions; Restoration\
    \ has the potential to be more than a stop-gap measure, providing an important\
    \ component of the portfolio of solutions to support coral reefs and their function\
    \ as coastal barriers into the future."
Methodology:
  2: Carbonate-budget models are used to assess reef accretion potential. Hydrodynamic
    modeling is used to determine the impact of changes in bathymetry from reef erosion
    and restoration combined with sea-level rise, on coastal flooding potential by
    2100. The study combines carbonate-budget studies and hydrodynamic modeling. Census-based
    carbonate-budget models are used to quantify spatial variability in reef-accretion
    potential.
  4: Carbonate-budget models are used to project reef-elevation changes and reef-accretion
    potential. Modeling of total water levels includes tides, waves, and storm surge.
    Analysis is applicable to Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM).
  5: Models are run with projected reef erosion and with present-day bathymetrics
    to show the difference in projections of maximum total water levels.
  6: Modeling the impacts of sea-level rise, storms, and coral restoration on total
    water levels and reef accretion potential at Buck Island National Reef Monument
    (BIRNM). Surveys were conducted in 2016. Results projected up to 2100.

    coast of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.
  4: Restoration has the potential to negate the wave-driven component associated
    with low-end sea-level-rise scenarios and substantially reduce total water levels,
    by up to 0.81 m on average, under intermediate-to-high sea-level rise scenarios.
    The reduction in total water levels due to reef restoration is quantified.
