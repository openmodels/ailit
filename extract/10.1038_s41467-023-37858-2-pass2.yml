Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea-level rise and storms are identified as drivers of risk. Coral-reef degradation
    also impacts coastal protection.
  2: Reef degradation, sea-level rise, and wave-driven water levels.
  3: Thermal-stress events, stony coral tissue-loss disease (SCTLD), climate-related
    mortality (potentially increasing over time), and sea-level rise are identified
    as drivers of risk.
  4: Sea-level rise, tides, waves, storm surge, nearshore bathymetry, erosion processes
    are identified as drivers of risk for coastal flooding.
  5: Sea-level rise, storm surge (10-year and 50-year storms), reef erosion.
  6: The drivers of risk include sea-level rise, storms (specifically Hurricane Maria),
    coral disease (SCTLD), and coral mortality from bleaching and other stressors.
    The geomorphic change of reef erosion also drives risk.
  7: Sea-level rise, storms (including increased frequency of severe storms due to
    climate change), and bioerosion are identified as key drivers. CO2 emissions scenarios
    (SSP5-8.5, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5) drive sea-level rise projections.
  8: Rising sea levels, storms (wave-driven water levels), and ongoing coral mortality
    are impacting reef accretion and coastal protection.
  9: Drivers of risk include sediment reincorporation, physical erosion, chemical
    dissolution, and bioerosion by parrotfish. The study also considers the impact
    of sea-level rise.
  10: Sea-level rise, storms (wave and surge), and climate-change impacts over time
    leading to increased mortality are considered as drivers of risk. Also, low population
    sizes limit sexual reproduction.

Highlights:
  1: Restoration of Acropora palmata, if successful, could mitigate the most extreme
    impacts of coastal flooding by reversing projected trajectories of reef erosion
    and allowing reefs to keep pace with ~0.5 m of sea-level rise expected by 2100
    with moderate carbon-emissions reductions.
  2: Sea-level rise will be the primary driver of coastal flooding, but reef erosion
    will result in a small, measurable increase in flooding potential by the end of
    the century. Successful coral-reef restoration could, in combination with climate-change
    mitigation, reduce the impacts of sea-level rise and wave-driven water levels.
  3: A single, large-scale A. palmata outplanting effort before 2030 could result
    in increases in coral cover for the next 20 years.
  4: Increasing Acropora palmata cover through restoration can significantly improve
    reef accretion and reduce coastal flooding during storms, potentially negating
    the wave-driven component associated with low-end sea-level-rise scenarios and
    substantially reducing water levels under higher sea-level-rise scenarios. The
    northern sector of the reef is projected to erode, leading to higher maximum total
    water levels compared to the southern sector.
  5: Sea-level rise is the most significant driver of increased total water levels
    and flooding potential, but reef erosion exacerbates the impact.
  6: Rising sea levels will be the dominant driver of future coastal flooding risk
    at BIRNM, but this risk is amplified by reef erosion. Restoration of A. palmata
    populations could result in substantial and sustained increases in coral cover
    and reef-accretion potential. The southern reef crest exhibited marginally positive
    reef-accretion potential due to the relatively high abundances of A. palmata and
    Ps. strigosa.
  7: Restoration of *A. palmata* cover could allow the reef to keep pace with low-end
    sea-level-rise projections, reducing storm surge. Hybrid restoration approaches,
    combining coral restoration with engineered structures, may be necessary under
    more pessimistic scenarios. The high costs of coral reef restoration can be balanced
    by the direct value to local communities/economies and the value of avoided infrastructure
    damages and flood protection.
  8: Coral restoration can minimize climate change impacts by increasing reef elevation
    and protecting reef structure. Doing nothing to combat erosion would amplify these
    impacts. Restoration has the potential to combat coastal flooding risk by the
    end of the century.
  9: Reef-accretion potential quantified is likely a maximum estimate as carbonate
    budget models do not incorporate impacts of physical erosion or chemical dissolution.
    The study suggests that regional calcification data from ReefBudget v1 is appropriate
    for BIRNM.
  10: Restoration has the potential to increase coral cover and reef-accretion potential.
    The modeled mean water levels, sea-swell wave heights and infragravity wave heights
    from the XBeach model agree well with observations across four locations.

Methodology:
  1: The study combines coral-growth measurements and carbonate-budget assessments
    of reef-accretion potential at Buck Island Reef, U.S. Virgin Islands, with hydrodynamic
    modeling to quantify future coastal flooding under various coral-restoration,
    sea-level rise, and storm scenarios.
  2: The study uses census-based carbonate-budget models, in situ measurements of
    A. palmata growth, and hydrodynamic modeling to determine how changes in bathymetry
    from reef erosion and restoration, combined with sea-level rise, impact coastal
    flooding potential by 2100. The carbonate budget was created using 2016 data.
  3: A simple population model (assuming no reproduction) was developed based on average
    planar growth rates of A. palmata from the study and literature-derived mortality
    and fragmentation rates to project potential changes in A. palmata cover.
  4: Carbonate-budget models are used to project reef elevation change and accretion
    potential. Modeling of total water levels incorporates tides, waves, and storm
    surge. Analysis is performed for Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM). The
    time horizon for some projections extends to 2100.
  5: Models were run with projected reef erosion from carbonate-budget models at 2100
    and present-day bathymetries to project maximum total water levels under sea-level
    rise and storm scenarios.
  6: The analysis models total water levels under various scenarios, considering reef
    degradation and restoration. The modeling extends to 2100.
  7: The study uses carbonate-budget and coral-growth models to project reef accretion
    potential under different sea-level-rise scenarios. The models consider *A. palmata*
    cover and reef elevation. The specific projections are applicable to the baseline
    ecological and geomorphic setting of BIRNM (Buck Island Reef National Monument).
    The study also estimates the omission of non-biological erosion to the results
    by following the approach of Toth et al. (2022).
  8: Calculates carbonate budgets by analyzing reef-census data from July 2016 at
    54 stratified-random sites in shallow fore-reef, reef-crest, and back-reef habitats.
    Uses point-count analysis of benthic transect photographs to quantify percent
    cover of benthic calcifiers and total consolidated substratum. Estimates gross
    carbonate production based on percent cover and taxon-specific calcification rates.
    Calculates bioerosion rates for parrotfish, sea urchins, and endolithic/microbioeroders
    based on density, size, and species. Estimates net carbonate production by subtracting
    bioerosion from gross carbonate production.
  9: The study modifies USGS lidar bathymetry using benthic habitat maps. Reef-accretion
    potential is quantified based on carbonate budget models (ReefBudget v1). Statistical
    analyses were conducted in R Studio using linear mixed-effects models. Hydrodynamic
    models were run using bathymetries created with ReefBudget v1.
  10: The study uses a model to project A. palmata population changes based on survival
    and fragmentation rates, and analyzes carbonate budgets to estimate reef-accretion
    potential. A two-dimensional (2D) XBeach surfbeat model is used to simulate wave
    and water-level transformation across the reef, validated against a large-wave
    event in 2016. Restoration scenarios are used to estimate the impact on reef accretion.

More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the shallow reef-crest zone as the most important habitat
    for shoreline protection. The unprecedented loss of A. palmata has fundamentally
    changed the structure and function of many western Atlantic reefs.
  2: The study focuses on Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM) off the coast
    of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.
  3: The study acknowledges variability in coral growth across space and time.
  4: The impact of wave components (sea-swell vs. infragravity waves) on water levels
    under sea-level rise is discussed.
  5: Study focuses on Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM). A. palmata loss
    contributed to decline in reef-accretion potential. Positive carbonate budgets
    are related to sites with coral cover >16%.
  6: The study acknowledges that their estimates of present-day reef-accretion potential
    are overly optimistic due to the omission of physical erosion and recent declines
    in coral populations. The long-term success of restoration for coastal protection
    depends not just on coral growth, but on the process of reef accretion.
  9: The ReefBudget v1 methodology has been revised (ReefBudget v2), which would produce
    some small changes in the estimated budgets. The study acknowledges limitations
    related to the use of regional calcification data and the timing of data collection
    relative to modeling efforts.
  10: The reef-accretion potential quantified is an optimistic, maximum estimate of
    long-term reef accretion. The authors acknowledge uncertainties in carbon emission
    scenarios and coral acclimation/adaptation to climate change.
  13: The article is related to coral reefs and coastal hazards, and appears to involve
    modeling and field data collection. The study seems to value the role of US coral
    reefs in coastal hazard risk reduction. The full article is needed to assess whether
    this analysis is relevant to impacts from direct climate hazards (e.g., sea level
    rise, coastal flooding).
Quantitative material:
  1: The study considers ~0.5 m of sea-level rise expected by 2100 with moderate carbon-emissions
    reductions.
  2: "Reef-accretion potential averaged -1.56 mm y\u22121 (\xB10.27 SE) across 54\
    \ sites. Average projected elevation change of the southern reef crest by 2100\
    \ was negligible at +1 cm (\xB110 cm). Bioerosion averaged -13.09 (\xB10.02) cm\
    \ by 2100."
  3: In the most optimistic scenario, a sustained increase of 30% A. palmata cover
    above the 2016 baseline is projected.
  4: "A 30% increase in A. palmata cover could allow reefs to keep pace with Low to\
    \ Intermediate-Low RSL rise scenarios. Maximum total water levels averaged 4.17\
    \ m (\xB10.03) under the 10-year storm scenario and 4.94 m (\xB10.02) under the\
    \ 50-year storm scenario with present-day bathymetry. Restoration could reduce\
    \ total water levels by up to 0.81 m (\xB10.03) under intermediate-to-high sea-level\
    \ rise scenarios."
  5: "Reef-accretion potential averaging -1.56 mm y\u22121 in 2016 at BIRNM."
  6: "The southern reef crest is predicted to more or less maintain its present-day\
    \ elevation by 2100, whereas most reef zones at BIRNM are projected to lose 0.12\u2013\
    0.23 m of elevation. Restoration could reduce total water levels by up to 0.81\
    \ m. A. palmata colonies have average vertical growth rates of ~70 mm y\u2212\
    1 at BIRNM. Beach area on the western side of the island has lost nearly 30% (0.88\
    \ ha) due to storm-driven erosion since 1954."
  7: "Reef-accretion potential of the reef crest could exceed 5 mm y\u22121 with restoration.\
    \ A 30% increase in *A. palmata* cover could allow the reef crest to keep pace\
    \ with a ~0.5 m sea-level rise by 2100. This could reduce total water levels during\
    \ storms by >10% (0.81 m). The cost of restoration is estimated at ~$25 USD per\
    \ *A. palmata* fragment."
  8: "Projects a ~0.2 m increase in wave-driven water levels during storms. Reports\
    \ erosion rates (0.45 m by 2100). Reports parrotfish bioerosion in kg CaCO3 m\u2212\
    2 y\u22121, sea urchin bioerosion in kg CaCO3 m\u22122 y\u22121, endolithic macrobioerosion\
    \ rate of 0.4 kg m\u22122 y\u22121, and microbioerosion rate of 0.27 kg m\u2212\
    2 y\u22121."
  9: The study used data from 2016 to estimate the rate of change in reef elevation
    by 2100. They also measured vertical growth and calcification rates of A. palmata
    and Ps. strigosa from June 2019 to July 2021. They developed a matrix model projecting
    the potential change in percent cover of A. palmata with outplanting of 100,000,
    250,000, and 500,000 colonies.
  10: Survival rate of A. palmata fragments in St. John was 3% after 12 years (1999-2011).
    Fixed, increased (44% net survival by 2100), and decreased (80% net survival by
    2100) climate change mortality scenarios. They also consider A. palmata cover
    increases from 5% to 30% in restoration scenarios. Historic carbonate production
    by *A. palmata* was 16.48 kg CaCO3 m-2 y-1. A generalized annual fragmentation
    rate of 10% and fragment-mortality rate of 40% is used, resulting in a decadal
    net fragmentation rate of 55%. Various sea-level rise scenarios (+0.0, +0.2, +0.5,
    +1.2, +2.0 m) and storm conditions (10- and 50-year storms) are used to force
    a hydrodynamic model.
