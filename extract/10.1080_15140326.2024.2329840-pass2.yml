Data descriptions:
  9: Temperature data for China is obtained from the National Centers for Environmental
    Information (NCEI) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  The
    sample period spans from 2004Q2 to 2021Q4.
Drivers of Risk:
  3: Temperature shocks (deviations from historical averages) as a proxy for climate
    change.
  6: Climate change uncertainty, concealed emissions, potential penalties, climate
    policy, supply shocks from climate change.
  7: Temperature shocks/high temperatures.
  8: Temperature shocks are used as a proxy for climate change and as the threshold
    variable in the TVAR model.
  9: Temperature shocks, calculated as temperature deviations from historical average
    temperatures, which indicate the trend of global warming and unanticipated temperature
    changes.
  10: Quarterly temperature shocks, computed as deviations from historical moving
    averages
  11: Temperature shocks, represented as deviations from historical 30/25/20-year
    moving averages, are analyzed.
  12: Temperature shocks act as a driver of risk, influencing the effectiveness of
    monetary policy and affecting macroeconomic outcomes.
  13: Temperature shocks (tempv_30, tempv_25, and tempv_20, reflecting deviations
    from historical moving averages) and monetary policy shocks
  14: Temperature shocks (tempv_30, tempv_25, tempv_20) and monetary policy shocks
    are drivers of risk. The endogeneity of temperature, potentially driven by economic
    growth and carbon emissions, is also noted.
  15: Monetary policy shocks and temperature deviations from historical averages.
  16: Temperature shocks (deviations from historical 30/25/20-year moving averages),
    monetary policy shocks, fiscal policy.
  17: Temperature shocks (deviations from 30/25/20-year moving averages), monetary
    policy shocks
  18: Temperature shocks (tempv_30, tempv_25, tempv_20 representing deviations from
    30/25/20-year moving averages) and monetary policy shocks (positive and negative).
  19: Temperature shocks (deviations from historical moving averages) and monetary
    policy shocks
  20: Temperature shocks (tempv_30, tempv_25, tempv_20), monetary policy shocks, shadow
    banking (sb), growth rate of the social entrusted loan scale, money stock (M2)
  21: Temperature shocks (deviations from historical average temperatures)
  22: Climate-induced credit constraint and increased non-performing loan ratio due
    to decreased firm profitability.
  24: No relevant information
Highlights:
  3: Expansionary monetary policy is less efficient and the negative impact of tight
    monetary policy is enhanced when climate change is severe.
  6: Climate change can impair agricultural yields, industrial output, and economic
    growth, which are primary monetary policy concerns.
  7: High temperatures weaken firm profitability, increase the default probabilities
    of bank loans, resulting in higher bank non-performing loan ratios. This makes
    banks more risk averse and prudent in expanding credit, dampening the efficiency
    of monetary policies (climate-induced credit constraint).
  8: The paper investigates whether climate change affects the influence of monetary
    policy, using temperature shocks as a proxy for climate change.
  10: All variables used in the TVAR model (including CPI and GDP) are stationary
    based on the ADF test at the 1% significance level. TVAR results are robust to
    using monthly industrial production data as a proxy for GDP.
  12: Temperature shocks weaken the efficiency of monetary expansions and heighten
    the effects of monetary tightening, indicating a temperature-regime dependency
    in monetary policy transmission.
  13: Climate change (represented by temperature shocks) leads to larger fluctuations
    in economic outputs (GDP) and lengthens the duration of divergence to steady states.
  14: The impact of monetary policy shocks on GDP varies depending on whether the
    temperature regime is 'low' or 'high'. The alternative order of endogenous variables
    in TVAR models is considered to improve the robustness of the analysis.
  15: Robustness confirmed; GDP impulse responses to monetary policy shocks similar
    across different temperature regimes.
  16: The efficiency of monetary policy is lower when the weather is hotter. The responses
    of output to monetary shocks become weaker when controlling for the effects of
    fiscal policy.
  17: Monetary policy shocks impact output differently under high and low temperature
    regimes. The use of alternative output indicators (industrial production) does
    not affect the empirical results. Results are consistent with larger sample size
    (monthly data).
  18: High temperatures weaken firm profitability, increase default probabilities
    of bank loans, and lead to higher non-performing loan ratios. This causes banks
    to be more risk averse, weakening the efficiency of monetary policies (climate-induced
    credit constraint).
  19: Monetary policy shocks have different effects on output (GDP_ind) under high
    and low temperature regimes; Temperature shocks impact bank loan growth and non-performing
    loan ratios
  20: Increases in temperature shocks impede bank lending.
  21: Temperature shocks increase the non-performing loan ratio of commercial banks.
    The non-performing loan ratio of banks has a complete mediating effect in explaining
    the influence of temperature shocks on monetary policies.
  22: Tight monetary policy is more affected under high-temperature regimes; central
    banks should incorporate climate change into monetary frameworks.

Methodology:

    and tight monetary shocks on economic output under high and low regimes of temperature
    shocks.

    impact of climate change on the transmission of monetary policy.
  8: A Threshold Vector Autoregression (TVAR) model is employed to examine the regime-dependent
    nonlinear effects of monetary policy in the context of climate change. Generalized
    impulse response functions (GIRF) are used to compute impulse responses.

    shocks on monetary policy effectiveness, with results applicable to monetary policy
    and temperature interactions.

    the impulse responses of macroeconomic variables to shocks, including monetary
    policy and temperature shocks. Fiscal policy, proxied by the year-on-year growth

    The applicability is for analyzing the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic
    variables under different temperature regimes.

More Notes:
  3: "The results are explained by climate-induced credit constraints of commercial\
    \ banks. Higher temperature shocks increase banks\u2019 non-performing loan ratios,\
    \ leading to larger credit constraints and weakening the bank credit channel of\
    \ monetary policy."
  6: The paper aims to address issues related to the effectiveness of monetary policy
    in the context of climate change, specifically considering climate change, monetary
    policy, and output simultaneously.
  7: The paper proposes that temperature shocks exacerbate the credit channel of monetary
    policy transmission.
  8: The model considers two regimes based on whether temperature shocks exceed a
    certain threshold. Ordering of variables matters; temperature shocks are ordered
    first, and output is ordered last in the baseline model.
  9: The paper uses the money stock growth rate as a proxy for monetary policy in
    China.
  10: Quarterly GDP data is used due to data availability; robustness check uses monthly
    industrial production.

    here.
  14: The temperature variables (tempv_30, tempv_25, tempv_20) represent quarterly
    temperatures deviating from historical 30/25/20-year moving averages.
  16: The paper uses a TVAR model to analyze the impact of temperature shocks and
    monetary policy on GDP and other macroeconomic variables in China. The temperature
    shocks are defined as deviations from historical moving averages. Fiscal policy
    is proxied by the year-on-year growth rate of public expenditure. Figure 5 illustrates
    the impulse responses to monetary policy shocks to output under high- and low-temperature
    shocks. Figure 7 shows that the responses of output to monetary shocks become
    weaker when controlling for the effects of fiscal policy.

    The model examines the interaction between temperature shocks, monetary policy,
    and macroeconomic variables.

    efficiency through a climate-induced credit constraint. The analysis looks at
    both positive and negative monetary policy shocks.
