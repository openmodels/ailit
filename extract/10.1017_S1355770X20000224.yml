Drivers of Risk:
  1: Early-life weather and pollution exposures, specifically extreme precipitation,
    temperature, carbon monoxide, and ozone.
  2: The study identifies temperature, precipitation, carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone
    (O3) as shocks impacting human capital and labor market outcomes.
  3: Early-life exposures to common environmental toxins exert long-term effects on
    human capital and labor market outcomes.
  5: Extremes of precipitation, temperature, wind speed, and humidity; deviations
    from seasonal averages; early-life CO and O3 exposure
  8: Extreme Temperature, Precipitation, Weather, Age, Male, Female
  13: Early-life pollution exposure is considered a driver of risk. Weather conditions
    (extreme weather, deviations from seasonal averages) are used as instrumental
    variables to estimate the effects of early-life pollution exposure.
  14: Extreme temperatures (high and low) and extreme precipitation (high and low)
    during gestation.
  16: Temperature (>90% of distribution), Temperature (<10% of distribution), Precipitation
    (>90% of distribution), Precipitation (<10% of distribution), CO (std.), O3 (std.)
  17: Early-life exposure to CO and O3 emissions, extreme precipitation and temperature.
  21: Temperature (high and low), precipitation (low), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone
    (O3).
  22: Early-life exposure to O3 precursor emissions.
  23: O3 (ozone) exposure; Weather; Pollution; Early-life environment
Highlights:
  1: Early-life pollution exposures negatively affect test scores, schooling, hours
    worked, and earnings, with significant implications for national-level GDP.
  2: Findings indicate significant short-term effects of extreme precipitation and
    temperature on anthropometric measures of human capital in early life, with long-term
    pollution effects.
  3: Significant contemporary effects of temperature on human capital but no long-term
    effects.
  13: Weather directly affects short-term anthropometric outcomes, but not long-term
    cognitive and labor market outcomes. The LIML estimates are the main results for
    outcomes where weather does not exhibit any direct effects.
  14: Extreme weather during gestation significantly affects short-term anthropometric
    measures, particularly low birth weight and birth length.
  16: O3 (std.) has statistically significant negative impacts on both Weekly Hours
    Worked and Log of Hourly Earnings, especially for females and informal workers.
  17: Early-life O3 exposure negatively affects achieved years of schooling and long-term
    labor market outcomes (hours worked, hourly earnings). The effects of early-life
    O3 exposure on hours is concentrated among males, and the earnings effect is driven
    by females. The informal sector drives both the hours and earnings effect.
  21: High temperatures and low precipitation increase the incidence of low birth
    weight. Both high and low temperatures and low precipitation negatively affect
    birth length. The effects of low precipitation extend to age 2 height. Ozone (O3)
    has statistically significant effects on long-term cognitive outcomes and labor
    market outcomes.
  22: First evidence of the effects on long-term earnings of early-life pollution
    exposure in a developing economy; A 25% reduction in early-life exposure to O3
    precursor emissions is an increase in earnings by 2.8 per cent and an increase
    in hours worked by 0.45 per week.
  23: Long-term benefits of environmental regulations may outweigh the costs and may
    fuel economic growth in developing nations; Long-term human capital gains from
    improvements to the early-life environment could provide fuel for economic growth
    and development.
Methodology:
  1: Combines a three-decade longitudinal survey measuring human capital development,
    a database of historical weather, and multiple databases characterizing carbon
    monoxide and ozone in the Philippines during the 1980s to examine the relationship
    between early-life weather and pollution exposures and short- and long-term human
    capital outcomes.
  2: Analysis combines a longitudinal birth cohort survey in the Philippines with
    unique weather and pollution data to estimate direct effects of environmental
    factors on human capital and labor market outcomes.
  5: Limited-information-maximum-likelihood (LIML) estimator with instrumental variables
    is used to estimate the effects of early-life CO and O3 exposure on human capital
    and labor market outcomes. The instrumental variables are precipitation and temperature
    extremes, extreme wind speed and humidity, deviations from seasonal averages,
    each interacted with location-specific concentrations of pollution sources. Ordinary
    Least Squares (OLS) is used to check if the instruments exert direct effects.
  8: Statistical analysis of data related to weather, migration, and health/economic
    outcomes. Results seem to be applicable to a specific region and timeframe related
    to the data collected.
  13: The study uses instrumental variables (weather instruments) to address omitted
    variable and measurement error biases. Equations (3) and (4) are estimated with
    LIML and MBTSLS. Sargan tests are used to test the differences between LIML and
    MBTSLS estimates.
  14: OLS regressions with robust standard errors, controlling for CO and O3 exposure,
    gender, birth season, mother's education, smoking and drinking during pregnancy,
    prenatal vitamin consumption, number of previous pregnancies, mother's height,
    mother's age, father presence, father's education, father's age, per capita household
    income, household use of solid fuels, non-piped water, and urban residence. Significance
    levels are indicated by *** 1%, ** 5%, *10%.
  16: Uses regressions with controls for various demographic and socioeconomic factors;
    employs LIML and MBTSLS estimation methods for pollution, instrumenting with extreme
    weather and deviations from seasonal means, interacted with local prevalence of
    polluters; adjusts p-values for multiple hypothesis tests using the Benjamini-Hochberg
    method.
  17: LIML and MBTSLS estimators are used. Sargan tests are performed. The analysis
    examines the impact of early-life exposure to CO and O3 on cognitive and labor
    market outcomes.
  21: OLS estimates were used to get the P-values for the short-term anthropometric
    outcomes. LIML estimates were used to get the P-values for long-term cognitive
    and long-term labor market outcomes. Multiple hypothesis test adjustments are
    used to generate Adjusted P-Values.
  22: "Generalizes outside the sample and assume external validity to scale O3\u2019\
    s effects on hours and earnings; Estimation of average treatment effects (ATEs)\
    \ requires that agents not select into exposure on the basis of an idiosyncratic\
    \ (and unobserved) component of their exposure response, an assumption which implies\
    \ the ignorance of agents (Heckman, 1997). Stylized, contextual facts provide\
    \ evidence of agent ignorance in this context."
  23: Utilizes unique data and novel methods to examine the short- and long-term effects
    of weather and pollution on human capital; Calculates the discounted present value
    of long-term effects using the mean present value of lifetime earnings at age
    zero; Assumes earnings are discounted at 3 per cent real rate (5 per cent discount
    rate with 2 per cent wage growth) back to age zero; Limited scope for pollution
    avoidance behaviors is assumed.
More Notes:
  5: The study area is the Philippines, specifically focusing on Cebu Province and
    Metro Cebu.
  14: This paper focuses on the impact of climate on anthropometric measures, which
    are relevant as determinants of labour productivity and long-term economic potential.
  21: The study acknowledges limitations, such as the lack of variation in typhoon
    exposure to identify its effects on short-term outcomes due to the entire Metro
    Cebu area being affected.
  22: Analysis focuses on Metropolitan Cebu; Mean present value of lifetime earnings
    at age zero in Metropolitan Cebu is approximately $39,927.
  23: Future research should address general equilibrium costs and benefits of efforts
    to improve environmental quality related to pollution as well as climate change.

    discounted lifetime earnings by $1,367, which would scale to $2.05 billion at
    the national level (or 2 per cent of 2005 GDP).
  3: Cumulative discounted lifetime earnings would increase by $1,367 per person,
    $44.5 million in the province, and $2.05 billion at the national level, representing
    2% of 2005 GDP.

    cognitive, and labor market outcomes. However, the specific quantitative information
    is not presented in this page.
  14: High temperature increases low birth weight likelihood by 2.4%. Low precipitation
    increases low birth weight likelihood by 1.2%. High and low temperatures reduce
    birth length by 0.017 and 0.022 z-score standard deviations, respectively. Low
    precipitation reduces birth length by 0.029 z-score standard deviations and reduces
    age 2 height by 0.014 z-score standard deviations.

    and pollution variables on weekly hours worked and the log of hourly earnings,
    broken down by full sample, females, and informal workers.
  17: A 1 standard deviation increase in early-life CO emissions exposure corresponds
    to a 0.027 standard deviation decrease in non-verbal test scores, and a 0.042
    standard deviation decrease in language test scores. Early-life O3 exposure reduces
    non-verbal test scores by 0.05 standard deviations, math test scores by 0.041
    standard deviations, and language test scores by 0.07 standard deviations. A 1
    standard deviation increase in early-life O3 exposure corresponds to 0.5 fewer
    years of schooling. Early-life O3 exposures decrease the number of hours worked
    per week by approximately 1.34 and hourly earnings by 8.2 per cent. A 1 standard
    deviation increase in early-life O3 exposure reduces female earnings by 12.3 per
    cent. In the informal sector, a 1 standard deviation increase in early-life O3
    exposure significantly reduces hours by 1.39 and earnings by 8.9 per cent.
  21: P-values and adjusted p-values are provided for various environmental factors
    on specific outcomes (e.g., low precipitation on birth length has p-value of 0.000
    and Adjusted P-Values of 0.045 and 0.008).
  22: A mandated 25 per cent reduction to emissions leads to increase in earnings
    by 2.8 per cent and an increase in hours worked by 0.45 per week.
  23: A 25 per cent reduction in O3 exposure has a discounted present value of $1,367
    per person; The benefits of reducing O3 precursor emissions are $44.5 million
    annually at the provincial level and $2.05 billion annually at the national level
    (2005 USD); The annual cost of the Philippine Clean Air Act of 1999 is $50 million.
