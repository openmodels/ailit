Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, population growth
  2: "Populations living on less-favored agricultural lands cope with major poverty\u2013\
    environment traps due to low productivity, lack of access to markets, and infrastructure\
    \ constraints, leading to overuse of environmental resources."
  6: Marginal agricultural lands, forest and woodland areas, arid zones; economic
    sphere (low GNI), health (child stunting), infrastructure (accessibility), ecological
    sphere (soil constraints), governance (political stability)
  7: Climate shocks impacting agriculture under marginal conditions.
  8: Climate change shocks (droughts, soil degradation and salinity, and heatwaves)
    and increased biophysical stresses on natural resources threaten global food security.
  9: Climate change, biodiversity loss, biophysical and socio-economic constraints
    undermining agricultural productivity, marginality of land
  11: Climate change; Climatic shocks; Imperfect or failing market conditions; Marginality
    (multidimensional phenomenon driven by several interconnected environmental and
    socioeconomic factors).
Highlights:
  1: Conventional policy approaches towards marginal agriculture have been conducive
    to favorable areas (specific to input-responsive crops only), neglecting marginal
    areas.
  2: Conventional research methods and agricultural technologies targeting favored
    agricultural areas have not adequately addressed the needs of poor farmers in
    marginal areas.
  6: Major marginality hotspots are in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Extremely
    marginal areas (five overlapping dimensions) should be prioritized for research
    and development programs for poverty and hunger alleviation
  7: Conventional agricultural policies have historically favored high-potential areas,
    neglecting marginal areas and limiting the ability of farmers in these areas to
    improve yields and sustainability. The Green Revolution's focus on input-responsive
    crops was not suitable for marginal lands, leading to regional inequality.
  8: Marginal areas have been overlooked in favor of high-potential areas, resulting
    in failures of development interventions due to insufficient knowledge of the
    heterogeneity in biophysical and socio-economic conditions.
  9: Investing in R&D in marginal areas may yield higher aggregate social returns
    compared to investing in high-potential areas.
  11: A shift in policy is needed from short-term solutions to comprehensive policies
    favoring long-term viable investments; Future policies must be context-specific
    and inclusive, engaging research institutions, policymakers, farmers, and consumers;
    Prioritization of extremely marginal areas for future research and development
    is suggested.
Methodology:
  1: "Review of historical policies towards marginal areas and development of a policy\
    \ framework targeting the food\u2013poverty\u2013environment nexus"
  2: No relevant information
  6: Overlaying indicator layers for different dimensions of marginality to find areas
    where multiple layers overlap; defining a 'marginality hotspot' as an area in
    which at least three dimensions of marginality overlapped
  9: Economic analysis of policy options, economic valuation of environmental impacts,
    poverty mapping, GIS techniques, spatially referenced datasets
  11: The paper identifies marginality hotspots based on overlapping dimensions of
    marginality (e.g., 1% of Sub-Saharan Africa where five dimensions overlap, or
    areas where two dimensions overlap).
More Notes:
  1: The paper advocates for regenerative agricultural systems driven by agro-ecological
    principles.
  2: Marginality is not a static condition and investments in technologies and proper
    management practices could reverse land degradation and transform marginal lands
    into productive agricultural lands.
  7: The debate centers on whether investments should be prioritized in high-potential
    agricultural areas or fragile and marginal production systems. Alternative livelihood
    options should be explored in marginal areas to ensure environmental and economic
    sustainability.
  9: Marginality is a dynamic concept, and interventions like new water-saving technologies
    or marketing routes can transform marginal areas into productive lands. Research
    should focus on neglected and under-utilized crop and livestock species.
  11: Public investments are warranted in marginal areas on both poverty and environmental
    grounds; Strategic options may vary from encouraging out-migration to promoting
    income diversification, increasing recurrent expenditure on safety nets, supporting
    more intensive agricultural development, and introducing payment schemes for environmental
    services.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Food security, poverty reduction
  2: No relevant information
  6: Poverty elimination and achieving SDG goals for poverty and hunger
  7: Impacts on poverty reduction, food security, income, and employment in rural
    areas.
  8: The authors note that agriculture must play a dual role and contribute to economic
    growth, rural employment, and poverty alleviation, especially in developing countries
    with larger shares of rural poor.
  9: Productivity, food security, poverty reduction, aggregate social returns
  11: Long-term food demand; Sustaining agriculture and livelihoods in agriculturally
    marginal areas.

  6: "Nearly two-thirds of rural populations (almost 1.8 million people) lived on\
    \ less-favored marginal lands; 36% of those are already extremely poor; By 2010,\
    \ as many as 1.75 billion people worldwide (about 38% of the rural population)\
    \ lived on remote, less-favored agricultural areas; Nearly all (1.6 out of 1.75\
    \ billion) people in marginal areas live in developing countries; Major hotspot\
    \ areas were identi\uFB01ed in South Asia (11% of land area) and Sub-Saharan Africa\
    \ (nearly 27% of land area); About 1% of the total Sub-Saharan Africa area suffered\
    \ \uFB01ve overlapping dimensions of marginality"
  9: Investments in R&D in marginal areas may give higher aggregate social returns
    to a nation than additional investments in high-potential and prime areas.
