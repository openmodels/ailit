Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increase in surface temperatures leading to enhanced instability and stronger
    moisture transport; changes in total column water vapor (TCWV), convective available
    potential energy (CAPE), and aerosol optical depth (AOD).
  6: Increase in moisture content, atmospheric instability (CAPE), greenhouse-gas-emission-induced
    global warming, land-sea thermal contrast, aerosols.
  7: No relevant information
  12: Changes in lightning occurrences and intensity, driven by temperature, total
    column water vapor (TCWV), aerosol optical depth (AOD), convective available potential
    energy (CAPE), and other atmospheric parameters influenced by GHG emissions.
  13: "Increased surface temperatures leading to higher instability and moisture transport;\
    \ stronger TCWV (Total Column Water Vapor) and CAPE (Convective Available Potential\
    \ Energy) trends; complex aerosol\u2013cloud interactions."
Highlights:
  1: Lightning frequency and intensity are projected to increase significantly across
    India by the end of the century, with the highest risk along the coasts.
  6: Lightning frequency and intensity are increasing across India, particularly in
    coastal regions, driven by changes in moisture, instability, and aerosol concentrations.
    The 90th percentile of lightning radiances shows a more pronounced increase than
    mean radiances.
  7: TCWV is the dominant parameter controlling climatic trends in lightning radiance
    over the India-wide region, while CAPE is the principal factor for lightning occurrence,
    with AOD and TCWV also contributing.
  12: Lightning frequency and intensity are projected to increase significantly, especially
    under the RCP8.5 scenario, driven by increases in CAPE and TCWV. Radiance trends
    are higher than occurrence trends, indicating more extreme lightning events. An
    exponential rise in TCWV and CAPE are observed after 2060 due to excessive GHG-emission-induced
    global warming.
  13: Coastal regions could face up to a 50% rise in extreme lightning intensities
    by 2100 under RCP8.5, posing an extreme socioeconomic threat.
Methodology:
  1: Statistical dominance analysis, multiple global circulation models (GCMs) used
    to understand the long-term impact of urbanization on lightning over the period
    from 1950 to 2100. Regression equations are used to relate lightning to causative
    factors.
  6: Analysis of lightning frequency and radiance trends over India using satellite
    data (TRMM) and correlation with meteorological factors (TCWV, CAPE, AOD) over
    a 17-year period. Clustering analysis to identify dominant factors affecting lightning
    trends.
  7: Multiple linear regression is used to quantify the relationship between lightning
    frequency/intensity and total column water vapor (TCWV), convective available
    potential energy (CAPE), and aerosol optical depth (AOD).
  12: Multi-model projections of various climate parameters (temperature, TCWV, AOD,
    CAPE, etc.) are used under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios to project lightning occurrences
    and intensity over 150 years. Bias correction is applied to the projections. Zonal
    trends are also examined. The analysis appears to be applicable to the Indian
    region.
  13: Multi-model GCM datasets are used to derive future projections of lightning
    properties; clustering and multilinear regression dominance tests are used to
    identify factors controlling lightning trends.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the Indian region and highlights the importance of understanding
    the drivers of lightning activity for policymaking.
  6: The IGP (Indo-Gangetic Plain) shows weaker lightning trends, potentially due
    to complex aerosol interactions. Aerosols may play a more dominant role in modulating
    lightning trends in continental northern Indian regions.
  7: The study explores the impact of atmospheric factors on lightning frequency and
    intensity across different regions of India, finding that aerosol-cloud interactions
    (AOD) play a complex role in modulating lightning properties, particularly in
    aerosol-sensitive zones.
  12: The analysis focuses on the impact of climate change on lightning, which is
    then indirectly assumed to impact macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes (this is not
    explicitly discussed in the document).
  13: The study identifies moisture (TCWV) as the principal factor controlling lightning
    extreme radiance trends, while instability (CAPE) and aerosols (AOD) jointly play
    a strong role in lightning frequency variation.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Loss of life due to lightning strikes (over 2500 every year over the last 2 decades).
  6: Increased lightning frequency could cause immense damage to life and property.
  7: No relevant information
  12: No relevant information
  13: An extreme socioeconomic threat, potentially requiring immediate mitigation
    strategies from policymakers, is posed by increased lightning intensities.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Lightning frequency and intensity values across the Indian region are expected\
    \ to increase \u223C10%\u201325% and 15%\u201350%, respectively, by the end of\
    \ the century."
  6: India has faced a ~25% increase in lightning frequency in 17 years. Mean annual
    lightning radiances show gradually increasing trends (with a total increase of
    ~20%). The 90th percentile of lightning radiances depict an India-wide trend of
    ~30% with higher correlation values.
  7: No relevant information
  12: Lightning occurrences are projected to increase by 26% under RCP2.6 and 35%
    under RCP8.5 scenarios (after bias correction) over 150 years. Lightning radiance
    is projected to increase by approximately 45% under RCP2.6 and 73% under RCP8.5
    scenarios (after bias correction) over 150 years. Zone-specific lightning radiance
    trends from the RCP2.6 scenarios depict an overall increasing trend of 35%-54%
    after zone-specific bias corrections. RCP8.5 scenario depicts an alarming increase
    of 56%-97% (after bias correction) in lightning radiance.
  13: "Lightning frequencies depict a weak rise of \u223C13% assuming the RCP2.6 scenario,\
    \ but this trend would increase to \u223C19% if the RCP8.5 scenario was adopted;\
    \ in the Coasts region, the trends may be slightly higher, reaching a maximum\
    \ of \u223C22% for the latter scenario. For extreme radiance, the minimum possible\
    \ increase considering stringent policy-making decisions from the RCP2.6 scenario\
    \ is \u223C22% throughout India. But in the absence of such restrictions (RCP8.5)\
    \ the overall increase in extreme radiance will be \u223C37% with respect to present.\
    \ Due to the impact of stronger TCWV and CAPE trends, the Coastal regions could\
    \ even face up to a \u223C50% rise in extreme lightning intensities by 2100."
