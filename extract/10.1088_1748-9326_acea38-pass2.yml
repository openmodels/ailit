Drivers of Risk:
  2: Flooding, flood insurance (NFIP) participation, community risk perception of
    flooding
  3: Rising sea levels, expanding flood plains, perceptions of future flood risk,
    past exposures to flooding, Hurricane Sandy.
  4: Peak annual flood hazards (W) above some threshold (T) cause simulated economic
    loss (L).
  6: Flooding events, including Hurricane Sandy and tropical storm Lee, impact housing
    prices.
  7: Flooding events, community exposure, community resilience, perceptions of flooding,
    governance, climate change (more intense rainfall, extended droughts, coastal
    storm surge)
  9: Precipitation, storm surge flood hazard, and community perceptions drive changes
    in house prices.
Highlights:
  2: The initial economic impact of Hurricane Sandy was largely absorbed by the National
    Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), but the region exhibited a long-term decline in
    home values. Tracts with greater post-flood change in active insurance policies
    exhibited larger decreases in mean home values.
  3: Home values can be decoupled from objective estimates of flood risk due to risk
    perceptions; Coastal housing prices have been driven more by perceptions of risk
    rather than actual hazard regimes.
  4: The model simulates the relationships between house price dynamics and community
    awareness of flooding.
  6: The research found that after Hurricane Sandy, housing prices experienced a clear
    drop, with a gradual recovery that was slower compared to previous years, suggesting
    a unique regional impact compared to other case studies.
  7: The SE model suggests that the immediate negative consequences of an isolated
    intense flooding event may continue to be absorbed by NFIP; Predicted changes
    to the flooding regime may result in sustained decreases in property values.
  9: The memory of past flooding and participation in NFIP may be important regional
    drivers of future house prices. Simulating flood impacts on HPs significantly
    improved the simulations of both HPs and community awareness.
Methodology:
  2: Socio-environmental (SE) model and interrupted time series model. Correlations
    between SE model parameters describing HP change and those describing tract-scale
    behaviors and perceptions.
  3: Socio-environmental (SE) models are used to map relationships between flooding
    hazards, community perceptions, community actions, and economic losses. A SE model
    is applied to 496 census tracts to estimate community flood perceptions. The modeling
    was validated with socio-economic datasets of population density, flood insurance
    claims and policies, and HP estimates.
  4: A System Dynamics model (SE model) simulates annual economic losses (L), population
    density (D), community flood awareness (A), and flood preparedness (P) based on
    a time series of peak annual flood hazards.
  6: The analysis used various housing market and socio-economic (SE) models calibrated
    with data from census tracts to explore relationships between housing prices (HPs)
    and perceptions of flood risks.
  7: Development of SE (socio-ecological) model to study interactions between processes;
    Three models (sigmoid recovery model, ITS model, K-shaped recovery model) used
    to simulate housing prices after flooding events.
  9: 'A socio-economic (SE) model was developed to assess the impact of floods on
    future house prices (HPs), incorporating precipitation and storm surge flood hazard.
    The model includes four HP response scenarios: no impact, sigmoid recovery, ITS
    recovery, and K-shaped recovery. The ITS recovery model best captured flooding
    dynamics in the study region.'
More Notes:
  2: Improved understanding of relationships between HPs, flood insurance, and community
    perceptions could support more equitable distribution of resources and improved
    policy interventions to reduce flooding risk.
  3: The study aims to understand if HP changes observed across the region after Hurricane
    Sandy could be attributed to community-scale perceptions of risk.
  4: The SE model considers the interplay between flood hazard, housing density, community
    awareness, and preparedness to simulate economic losses.
  7: The study region includes coastal communities and is highly vulnerable to flooding.
  9: The model has limitations; it might not simultaneously reproduce all aspects
    of the housing and NFIP system due to imperfect forcing data or model formulation.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Home values
  3: Home values impacted by flooding and risk perception; potential effects on national
    and global financial system.
  4: Annual economic losses (L) due to flooding are simulated.
  7: Property values
  9: House prices are affected by flood events and influence flood loss estimates.
Quantitative material:
  2: Analysis of mean housing values across 496 coastal census tracts of New York,
    Connecticut, and New Jersey from 1970 to 2021. Long-term decline in home values
    after Hurricane Sandy.
  3: Study focuses on 496 coastal census tracts across New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut;
    Analyzes relationships between flooding loss, community perception, and mean house
    value.
  4: "From 1979 to 2021, the average annual number of flood insurance claims submitted\
    \ through NFIP in this region was 3,476 claims 1year\u22121 with an average annual\
    \ claim total of $112 million."
  7: Annual time series of NFI reported flooding insurance claims
  9: The immediate impact of Hurricane Sandy was largely absorbed by the NFIP, but
    the region experienced a sustained decline in housing values afterward. Correlations
    were observed between model parameters representing changes in housing values
    post-floods and those describing community behavior and perceptions. Census tracts
    with greater change in insurance uptake following floods witnessed larger decreases
    in mean home values.
