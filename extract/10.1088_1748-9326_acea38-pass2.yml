Drivers of Risk:
  2: Flooding (specifically Hurricane Sandy), flood insurance (NFIP participation),
    and community risk perception.
  3: Flooding (past exposures and perceptions of future risk), Hurricane Sandy.
  4: Peak annual flood hazards (i.e., high surge elevations, extreme rainfall, (W))
    above some threshold (T)
  5: The analysis evaluates the impact of flooding hazards on housing density and
    awareness, specifically distinguishing between surge- and rainfall-driven flooding
    events.
  6: Flooding events, particularly Hurricane Sandy, and community perceptions/responses
    to floods (anxiousness, forgetfulness, preparedness).
  7: Flooding events are a driver of risk.
  8: Flooding losses and perceived flood risk. Actual changes to flood hazards, social
    vulnerability, number of tracts considered from each state.
  9: Floods (precipitation and storm surge).
Evaluation overview:
  2: Home values in coastal census tracts of New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey.
  3: Home values and community perceptions of flood risk in coastal areas.
  4: Annual economic losses (L), population density (D), community flood awareness
    (A), and flood preparedness (P)
  6: Housing prices (HPs) and community perceptions of flooding risk.
  7: Housing price indices and flooding insurance claims are evaluated as outcomes.
  8: Housing prices (HP) as affected by perceptions of risk and National Flood Insurance
    Program (NFIP) participation.
  9: House prices and flood losses.
Highlights:
  2: The initial economic impact of Hurricane Sandy was largely absorbed by the National
    Flood Insurance Program (NFIP); however, the region then exhibited a long-term
    decline in home values.
  3: The study aims to understand if home price changes observed after Hurricane Sandy
    can be attributed to community-scale perceptions of risk.
  4: SE model accurately simulates human-flood dynamics across a variety of case studies
  5: Three recovery models (sigmoid, interrupted time series, K-shaped) were developed
    to simulate temporal changes in housing perceptions due to flooding impacts.
  6: Hurricane Sandy had a limited immediate impact on housing values; however, there
    was a clear drop in relative HPs. State-level variations in the relationships
    between model parameters describing flood risk perceptions and HP dynamics are
    evident.
  7: The SE model suggests that the immediate negative consequences of an isolated
    intense flooding event may continue to be absorbed by NFIP.
  8: NFIP may have unintended consequence of conditioning housing values on perceived
    risks, decoupled from actual risk. Increases in NFIP participation drive short-term
    perceptions of increased risk, which then steadily drive down housing values.
    Housing values in the region driven more by perceptions and NFIP participation
    than actual flood risk.
  9: The immediate impact of 2012 Hurricane Sandy on the housing market was largely
    absorbed by the NFIP; however, the region experienced a sustained decline in housing
    values afterwards. Census tracts with greater change in insurance uptake following
    floods witnessed larger decreases in mean home values compared to those with more
    stable NFIP participation. The model simulations indicated trade-offs between
    accurately simulating housing prices (KGEHP) and loss (KGEL), suggesting the models
    evaluated did not simultaneously reproduce all aspects of the housing and NFIP
    system.
Methodology:
  2: A socio-environmental (SE) model was used to study the temporal impacts of flooding
    on mean housing values across 496 coastal census tracts from 1970 to 2021. Correlations
    were found between SE model parameters describing HP change and those describing
    tract-scale behaviors and perceptions.
  3: Uses a socio-environmental (SE) model to estimate community perceptions of flooding,
    validated with socioeconomic datasets (population density, flood insurance claims/policies,
    home price estimates). Evaluates competing models of the relationship between
    flooding loss, community perception, and mean house value.
  4: SE model simulates annual economic losses (L), population density (D), community
    flood awareness (A), and flood preparedness (P) based on a time series of peak
    annual flood hazards. Model simulates effects of flood hazards on losses, which
    then affects awareness and preparedness. In the absence of floods, awareness and
    preparedness decrease and population density increases.
  5: "The study modifies an original SE model to include time-varying HP models for\
    \ temporal changes linked to flooding impacts, using data from 1970\u20132021\
    \ for calibration across census tracts."
  6: Integration of housing models into a Socio-Economic (SE) model. The model is
    calibrated to observed NFIP claims, policies, population density, and mean HPs
    across census tracts.
  7: The study developed SE (socio-ecological) models, including a sigmoid recovery
    model, ITS (Interrupted Time Series) model, and a K-shaped recovery model, to
    simulate housing price trends compared to actual data. The SE model's parameter
    describes changes in community risk.
  8: Statistical correlation analysis of SE model parameters related to flood awareness,
    preparedness, and housing prices across different regions (census tracts and states).
    Results are applicable to the study region during the period analyzed in the original
    paper, though that period is not stated in this text.
  9: 'Developed a SE (socio-economic) model to assess the impact of floods on future
    HPs, which then feedbacks to the estimate of future flood loss. The model incorporates
    both precipitation and storm surge flood hazard and includes four HP response
    scenarios: (1) a model assuming no impact, and models assuming initial losses
    followed by (2) a sigmoid recovery, (3) an ITS recovery, and (4) a K-shaped recovery.
    The ITS recovery model best captured flooding dynamics in the study region.'
More Notes:
  2: The study suggests that the salience of past flooding events and NFIP participation
    are important regional drivers of home prices.
  3: The study focuses on the years following Hurricane Sandy to capture the effects
    of flooding events on future house prices.
  6: The Integrated Transportation System (ITS) model provided the most accurate representation
    of flooding dynamics across the study region. Parameters b2 and b3 control initial
    drop in HPs due to flooding and the rate of HP recovery, respectively.
  7: The study uses tools that consider how processes interact within the SE system
    to understand the relationships between housing values and community perceptions
    of flooding.

Quantitative material:
  2: The region exhibited a long-term decline in home values after Hurricane Sandy
    that was well-described by an interrupted time series model. Tracts with greater
    post-flood change in active insurance policies exhibited larger decreases in mean
    home values.
  3: Focuses on coastal communities in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut using
    496 census tracts.
  4: "The average annual maximum daily precipitation was 7.4cm 1 day\u2212 1 with\
    \ nine precipitation events exceeding 10 cm 1 day\u2212 1 from 1970\u20132021."
  5: The Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) is used as a metric for evaluating predictive
    skill, comparing simulated values with observed values across factors such as
    active NFIP policies, population density, and housing perceptions.
  6: Spearman's ranked correlation used to assess relationships between calibrated
    model parameters.
  7: Figure 3 shows annual timeseries of NFIPreported flooding insurance claims.
  8: Correlations between calibrated SE model parameters across all census tracts
    and by state (New Jersey, New York, Connecticut). P-values associated with correlation
    coefficients (P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.001).
  9: Simulating flood impacts on HPs significantly improved the simulations of both
    HPs (KGEHP) and community awareness (KGEA) (figure S5).
