Drivers of Risk:
  3: Natural disasters, particularly their direct impact on households at various
    income levels, which depend on country characteristics.
  5: Natural disasters, measured as the percentage of the population affected, are
    considered a driver of risk.
  6: Natural disasters (all, biological, meteorological)
  7: The graphs indicate the variation of inequality over time and across different
    districts in Sri Lanka, potentially suggesting vulnerability based on location
    and time period.
  8: Natural disasters (current and lagged).
  9: Disaster impact on inequality of components of income
  10: Natural disasters (% Population Affected) and its lags
  11: Natural disasters (climatic, hydrological, geophysical, meteorological, oceanic,
    or biological)

    meteorological)'

Highlights:
  3: Natural disasters can increase income inequality by disproportionately affecting
    poorer households and territories.
  5: There appears to be a significant negative correlation between disasters and
    income inequality, suggesting a possible reduction of income inequality by natural
    disasters after controlling for disaster lags, time invariant district fixed effects
    and time fixed effects.
  6: Natural disasters affect income inequality.
  7: The Theil index varies considerably across districts and over time, indicating
    spatial and temporal inequality dynamics in Sri Lanka.
  8: Natural disasters have a statistically significant negative impact on income
    inequality in Sri Lanka, though the effect varies across different components
    of income and with time lags.
  10: Natural disasters and their immediate lags tend to reduce income inequality
    measured by the Theil index, Gini coefficient, and inter quintile range of average
    income.
  11: Current natural disasters negatively affect mean household income. Disasters
    in the previous year negatively affect median household income. Income of all
    quintiles is affected by natural disasters. The paper finds evidence that income
    of all the quintiles is affected by natural disasters
  12: Table 12 indicates that disasters are significantly associated with mean household
    income (positive association). Disasters are also significantly associated with
    income in quantile 1 (Q1) and quantile 5 (Q5) income.
  13: Contemporaneous natural disasters and their immediate lags decrease district-level
    income inequality as measured by the Theil index. Different natural disaster subgroups
    affect mean, median household incomes, and income across quintiles differently.
    Richer quintiles disproportionately bear direct disaster damages at a higher cost,
    though disasters may open opportunities for the poor.
  14: Natural disasters lead to lesser income inequality, primarily because richer
    households suffer greater losses in profits and income. Different types of disasters
    have different impacts on household income depending on the income quintile.
Methodology:
  3: Empirical analysis using disaster data from the Disaster Management Centre of
    Sri Lanka and socio-economic data from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey
    series.
  5: The study employs a panel regression estimator with district and time fixed effects.
    The analysis is applicable to Sri Lanka.
  6: Panel fixed effects estimator, ordinary least squares (OLS), System GMM; Regression
    with disaster lags, district and time fixed effects, control variables such as
    median household income and headcount index; Decomposition of Theil index into
    income components; Analysis of household expenditure survey data.
  7: The analysis uses survey data from 1990, 1995, 2006, 2009, and 2012 to measure
    inequality using the Theil index for different districts in Sri Lanka.
  8: Panel regression of district-level inequality measures on contemporaneous and
    lagged disaster data, with district and time fixed effects and errors clustered
    at the district level. Results applicable to Sri Lanka based on six waves of surveys.
  9: Analysis of income shares by quintiles over time to assess the impact of disasters
    on inequality.
  10: Panel data regression with district and time fixed effects, clustered standard
    errors at the district level. Balanced panel of 17 districts and a panel of district
    level inequality measures for six waves of surveys are used. Alternative estimators
    (OLS, difference and system GMM) are also used as a robustness check.
  11: Panel data regressions with district and time fixed effects, GMM estimators
    (difference and system GMM), OLS. Applicable for analyzing the impact of natural
    disasters on income and expenditure inequality at a district level over multiple
    time periods.
  12: Panel data regressions at the district level, using various estimators (FE,
    OLS, Diff. GMM, Sys. GMM). Models include district and time fixed effects. Errors
    clustered at the district level. Disaster data is both contemporaneous and lagged.
  13: Panel fixed effects estimator used to analyze the impact of natural disasters
    on income inequality in Sri Lanka at the district level, using a panel dataset
    for six survey periods between 1990 and 2013. Errors are clustered at the district
    level.
  14: Panel data analysis at the district level in Sri Lanka, with district and time
    fixed effects, errors clustered at the district level, using six waves of surveys
    with contemporaneous disaster data. Models include a constant term.
More Notes:
  5: Data covers multiple districts in Sri Lanka, but some districts (Jaffna, Kilinochchi
    and Mannar) are only covered in the last survey wave (2012/13). The analysis exploits
    variation of inequality over time across districts.
  6: The analysis checks against omitted variable bias. Extreme survey waves (2006/07
    and 2009/10) are excluded to ensure results are not driven by these events.
  7: The paper appears to be analyzing inequality trends across districts in Sri Lanka,
    and figures do not mention climate change or adaptation.
  8: The effect of natural disasters on income inequality changes over time, with
    an initial decrease followed by a potential increase in inequality after four
    years, potentially due to the phasing out of disaster relief and recovery efforts.
  10: Excluding post-tsunami and post-war survey waves alters the results somewhat,
    but the effect of natural disasters on income inequality remains significant.
  11: The paper explores the impact of current and lagged disasters on income inequality,
    using various inequality measures. It considers different disaster sub-groups
    and examines the impact on different income quintiles. Results suggest that current
    disasters negatively affect income of both the poorest and richest quintiles.
  12: Different types of natural disasters are defined, along with factors that influence
    their impact (magnitude, intensity, frequency, etc.).
  13: Biological disasters are excluded from some analyses due to their unique characteristics.
    The analysis considers lagged effects of disasters up to five periods (Table 15).
    Excluding meteorological disasters yields similar results to the base model. The
    study investigates the impact of disasters on household expenditure inequality
    and finds no evidence of such an effect.
  14: Analysis does not capture potential internal migration as a result of natural
    disasters. Analysis could be repeated for other countries with better data. Results
    may not represent lower income countries which mainly depend on agriculture and
    are more vulnerable to disasters.

  6: Table 2 provides mean income, median income, Theil index, Gini coefficient, and
    interquartile/interquintile range of income (IQ4R/IQ5R) by district in Sri Lanka.  The
    map of Sri Lanka provides population affected due to all natural disasters occurred
    during the survey year in each district. The values of the indicators are presented
    for each of the 25 districts of Sri Lanka.
  7: The figures show the Theil index values over time for different districts, ranging
    from approximately 0 to 3. The first figure depicts the distribution of the mean
    inequality across districts.
  8: An increase of current disaster affected population by one percentage point would
    reduce income inequality measured by Theil index by 0.0062 points. Statistically
    significant negative impact of natural disasters that occurred in the same year,
    two years and three years prior to the survey on income inequality measured by
    Theil index. Natural disasters and their immediate lags significantly decrease
    non-agricultural income inequality and non-seasonal agricultural income inequality,
    but increase seasonal agricultural income inequality.
