Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate variations, specifically temperature and precipitation in distinct agricultural
    regions and seasons, are identified as drivers impacting TFP.
  2: Exogenous shocks such as weather variability, extreme weather events, and climate
    anomalies impact TFP.
  3: The drivers of risk include temperature anomalies (TA) and precipitation (PR)
    anomalies in different seasons, including warmer autumns, cooler springs, cooler
    winter temperatures, and heat stress.
  4: Temperature and precipitation in certain seasons, warmer winter temperatures
    leading to snow melt and reduced soil moisture, increased summer rainfall in transition
    zones.
  5: The paper identifies regional climate variations, trends in climate indices (warming,
    decreased water availability, enhanced extremes), and policy interventions (PIK
    program, Food Security Act) as drivers impacting agricultural productivity.
  6: The top four contributors to the projected TFP decline are warmer summers in
    the Midwest, warmer autumns in scattered regions across the Southwest, warmer
    springs in the Southwest, and warmer summers in California and Nevada. A fifth
    contributor is decreasing amount and increasing variability of summer precipitation
    in the transition zone between the Corn and Cotton Belts.
  8: Mentions extreme heat stress (Deryng et al., 2014), temperature and precipitation
    (Lobell et al., 2007), climate variation (Ray et al., 2015), and rising CO2 concentrations
    (Long et al., 2006).
  9: Temperature (TA, TN, TM) and Precipitation (PR) variability are considered as
    climate drivers. Specifically, changes in autumn, spring, summer, and winter temperatures
    and precipitation.
  10: Projected increases in autumn temperature (California, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona,
    New Mexico), spring temperature (Southwest), and summer temperature (California,
    Nevada). Also, a projected decrease in amount and increase in variability of summer
    precipitation along the transition zone.
  11: The study considers climate indices such as temperature and precipitation as
    drivers of risk for agricultural TFPC.
  12: Shift in temperature anomalies from cooler to warmer between 1951-1980 and 1981-2010
  13: Examines correlations with temperature and precipitation as potential drivers
    of risk, impacting agricultural output and sector importance.
  14: Climate projections (based on RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios)

    change impacts on agriculture (Nelson et al., 2014; Rosenzweig et al., 2014),
    climate change impacts on dairy production (Key et al., 2014), economic losses
    from heat stress in livestock (St-Pierre et al., 2003), and climate change effects
    on warm-season livestock (Mader et al., 2009). Also discusses groundwater depletion
    (Konikow, 2013).

    US agriculture.
  10: Evaluates Total Factor Productivity (TFP) loss in US agriculture as a measure
    of the climate penalty.
  11: The study evaluates the impact of climate on Total Factor Productivity Change
    (TFPC) in agriculture.
  12: No relevant information
  13: Analyzes the percentage of grids where TFPC (temperature and precipitation correlations)
    are significant, indicating changes in climate.
  14: Compound annual TFP (Total Factor Productivity) growth rate
Highlights:
  1: The paper indicates that despite improvements in technology outweighing the effects
    of climate, projected climate changes could result in TFP falling to pre-1980
    levels by 2050, even with current innovation rates.
  2: Since 1970, TFP growth rates have become highly variable, and the analysis suggests
    climate as a significant factor in this variability.
  3: TFPC became much more sensitive to climate from 1981-2010 compared to 1951-1980.
    Summer productivity growth was associated with cooler temperatures over the US
    agricultural heartland but warmer temperatures in California and its border areas
    in the later period. Warmer autumns in Texas and the Northeast through the Midwest
    and mid-Atlantic regions were associated with higher agricultural productivity
    in the earlier period.
  4: Climate dependence of US agricultural productivity significantly increased after
    1980; positive temperature correlations weakened and negative correlations strengthened
    over time.
  5: While the aggregate TFPC effects of regional climate trends have been relatively
    small so far, future climate changes (increased warming, decreased water availability,
    and enhanced extremes) could have important consequences for the long-term TFP
    growth of US agriculture. TFP sensitivity to climate variables has greatly increased
    in more recent times (1981-2010 compared to 1951-1980). Future projections indicate
    a decline in TFP under both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, with a steeper decline
    under RCP 8.5.
  6: "All gains in US agricultural productivity during 1981\u20132010 will likely\
    \ be canceled by a climate penalty before \u223C 2050 if significant adaptation\
    \ does not occur."
  9: Changes in sectoral contributions to TFP, particularly the growing reliance on
    crop production and the increasing importance of farm-related goods and services,
    likely caused TFPC sensitivity to increase.
  10: TFP loss may be higher than yield loss because it reflects the added costs of
    maintaining yield under less beneficial climate conditions. Future climate penalty
    reduces TFP at greater rates than it has grown in recent decades, and the rate
    of loss increases significantly over time. Productivity appears to be significantly
    more sensitive than yield to climate.
  11: The study finds that irrigation has, so far, made regional productivity relatively
    immune to precipitation changes, but future TFP reductions could exceed model
    predictions if water sources become less plentiful. Adaptation may potentially
    lower TFP losses through improved technology or changed practices, but these remain
    unpredictable and are not accounted for by the model.
  12: Increased frequency of warmer temperature anomalies in 1981-2010 compared to
    1951-1980
  13: Crops maintain majority contribution to US agriculture value, while Livestock
    decreases and Farm-related sector increases over the period.
  14: RCP8.5 scenario generally shows larger declines in TFP growth compared to RCP4.5.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis is performed using correlations between regional climate variations
    and national TFP changes, employing a multivariate regression model to predict
    TFP growth based on these climate factors.
  2: The study analyzes the correlation of national TFPC with seasonal and geographic
    distributions of climate variables, using a multivariate regression model.
  3: The analysis uses 30-year correlations (1951-1980 and 1981-2010) to identify
    key regions where regional climate indices significantly affect national TFPC.
  4: Uses seasonal temperature and precipitation averages over 10 regions to construct
    climate indices that affect TFPC; develops regression models for two periods (1951-1980
    and 1981-2010) to capture TFPC-climate relationships; performs a running correlation
    analysis over 20-year periods.
  5: "The analysis uses a model to evaluate potential TFP responses to projected future\
    \ climate changes based on statistical relationships observed in 1981-2010, assuming\
    \ that technological advances and adaptation practices remain the same as in 1981\u2013\
    2010. Model 2 is referenced, suggesting multiple models were used."
  6: The analysis uses CMIP5 simulations for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 to project changes
    to climate indices. Factor analysis is performed on projected changes in regional
    climate indices to determine key contributors to future US TFP declines. Correlation
    analyses are performed between TFPC and climate variables. The TFP projections
    are based on an assumption that technological advances, agricultural practices,
    and long-term factors such as CO2 fertilization will continue as in the past.
  8: Includes model intercomparison for assessing agricultural risks (Rosenzweig et
    al., 2014) and analysis of regional surface climate conditions using CMIP3 and
    CMIP5 (Sun et al., 2015).
  9: "The reference period for present-day climate base is 1976\u20132005, and future\
    \ climate change is calculated as differences from this reference."
  10: Uses an analytical approach that differs from partial productivity studies,
    focusing on the observed relationships between the US agricultural economy and
    climate variations to project future productivity change. Rates were calculated
    as compound annual growth rates from 2010 to 2040, the year by which 75% of models
    project a TFP drop off to pre-1980s levels.
  11: The analysis uses lasso regression to model the relationship between climate
    indices and TFPC, comparing it to stepwise regression. The reported models are
    applicable for the periods 1951-1980 and 1981-2010.
  12: Analysis of temperature anomaly correlations with TFPC over US land across two
    periods, separated by positive and negative correlations
  14: Regression analysis with 28-year submodels used to estimate uncertainty.
More Notes:
  1: The paper signifies a shift from localized studies to linking regional climate
    effects to national economic outcomes, enhancing policy-making resources.
  3: The analysis highlights regional differences in the impact of climate on agricultural
    productivity, with some regions benefiting from warmer temperatures while others
    are negatively affected by heat stress.
  4: The analysis suggests agricultural productivity has become more sensitive to
    climate in recent years.
  5: The study acknowledges the influence of non-climate factors, such as policy interventions
    and shifts in crop production, on agricultural productivity. The mandate-driven
    demand for biofuels and the conversion of corn crops to energy production are
    also identified as potential influences.
  6: "The modeled TFP decline represents the penalty arising solely from projected\
    \ climate changes over the key agricultural regions. The model describes \u223C\
    \ 70% of measured TFPC variance."
  10: Model is built on observed regional climate anomalies, which are linked to measured
    economic responses. Once future climate changes exceed the magnitude of historical
    anomalies, the observed past relationships may no longer hold true, and the model
    may no longer be applicable.
  11: The study acknowledges the potential impact of policies such as the PIK program
    and biofuel mandates on TFPC, but the general effect of policy has yet to be established.
    The analysis found no persistent correlation between agricultural international
    trade and TFPC.
  12: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: "The analysis shows that temperature and precipitation explain approximately\
    \ 70% of variations in TFP growth during 1981\u20132010, with future climate changes\
    \ potentially causing TFP to drop by an average of 2.84 to 4.34% per year under\
    \ medium to high emissions scenarios."
  2: TFP has grown at an annual rate of 1.43% since 1948, and aggregate agricultural
    output grew at an average rate of 1.50% per year from 1948 to 2011.
  3: "The paper refers to statistically significant correlations between TFPC and\
    \ climate variables, and notes correlations greater than \xB10.361 are depicted."
  4: Model 1 (1951-1980) explains almost 50% of TFPC variance; Model 2 (1981-2010)
    explains around 70% of variance. From 1979-2008, more than 60% of yield variability
    can be explained by climate variability.
  5: The climate trends caused a net TFP loss of 0.0003846 per year, which has been
    outweighed by a technological gain of 0.014865 per year. The immediate effect
    of the 1983 PIK program was a drastic reduction in productivity (by close to 15
    to 16%).
  6: "The climate penalty is projected to reduce TFP by approximately 2.84% per year\
    \ under RCP4.5 and 4.34% per year under RCP8.5 from 2010 to 2040. The authors\
    \ project that US agricultural TFP will drop to pre-1980s levels by \u223C 2040\
    \ or earlier, and 90% of models project this drop-off to occur by 2043 and 2051\
    \ for RCP8.5 and RCP4.5, respectively."
  9: In 1981-2010 precipitation showed a more significant impact with 9.1% of grids
    having positive correlations in summer and 10.4% (7.4%) of grids showing negative
    correlations in winter (spring).
  10: "Under RCP4.5, the climate penalty will reduce TFP by \u223C2.84% per year through\
    \ 2040 (range: 1.75% to 5.19%). Under RCP8.5, the mean loss rate is 4.34% per\
    \ year (range: 2.52% to 13.32%)."
  11: The paper includes lasso regression equations for TFPC based on climate indices
    for the periods 1951-1980 and 1981-2010, providing specific coefficients for each
    climate variable's influence.

    two periods
  13: 'Provides percentages of agricultural sector contributions to total output,
    showing changes from 1951 to 2001: Crops increase to near 60%, Livestock decreases
    to around 30%, and Farm-related rises to above 10%.'
  14: Projected percentage change in TFP growth rate ranging from -35% to 5% for time
    periods 2010-2020, 2020-2030, 2030-2040, and 2010-2040.
