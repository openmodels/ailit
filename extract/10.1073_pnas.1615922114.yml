Drivers of Risk:
  1: Regional climate variations such as temperature and precipitation changes impact
    agricultural productivity.
  2: Climate patterns, weather fluctuations (droughts, floods, extreme weather events),
    climate anomalies, exogenous shocks (weather, market, policy fluctuations), climate
    influence on TFP.
  3: Temperature Anomalies (TA) and Precipitation (PR) impact TFPC, with differing
    effects based on region, season, and time period (1951-1980 vs. 1981-2010).
  4: Temperature and precipitation variations in different seasons; winter temperatures
    leading to snow melt and reduced soil moisture; increased summer rainfall in grazing
    lands; climate variability.
  5: Regional climate variations, policy interventions (e.g., PIK program, Food Security
    Act of 1985), production of oil crops, mandate-driven demand for biofuels, increased
    warming trends, decreased water availability, and enhanced extremes.
  7: Regional climate variations, specifically temperature (TA) and precipitation
    (PR) anomalies during different seasons, are identified as drivers of TFPC.
  8: Extreme heat stress (Deryng et al., 2014). Climate change impacts (Karl et al.,
    2009; Melillo et al., 2014). Climate variation (Ray et al., 2015). Temperature
    and precipitation on California crop yields (Lobell et al., 2007). Rising CO2
    concentrations (Long et al., 2006). Climate change effects on warm-season livestock
    production (Mader et al., 2009). Transition to a more arid climate in southwestern
    North America (Seager et al., 2007). Groundwater Depletion (Konikow et al., 2013).
  9: Changes in temperature (TA, TN, TM) and precipitation (PR) patterns; Climate
    change, specifically increases in summer temperatures, and the relative importance
    of crops, livestock, and farm-related goods and services on TFPC sensitivity.
  10: Climate change-induced temperature increases in specific regions (Southwest,
    California, Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona) affecting crop and livestock productivity.
  11: Climate change impacts on agricultural productivity (TFP), specifically changes
    in temperature and precipitation.
  14: Climate change scenarios (specifically RCP8.5 and RCP4.5).
Highlights:
  1: Projected climate changes could reduce TFP to pre-1980 levels by 2050 if current
    climate-productivity relationships continue.
  2: Climate has been a significant factor in explaining TFP variability; Climate
    variability adversely impacts aggregate agricultural TFP growth.
  3: TFPC became much more sensitive to climate variability after 1980.  Warmer temperatures
    in the agricultural heartland during summer are now negatively correlated with
    TFPC, while warmer temperatures in California and its border areas (excluding
    much of the Central Valley) are now positively correlated with TFPC, in the summer.
  4: "Climate dependence of US agricultural productivity significantly increased after\
    \ 1980.  Negative temperature correlations have strengthened over time. TFPC is\
    \ more sensitive to climate in recent years. Historical TFPC\u2212Climate Dependence\
    \ Simulations indicate agricultural productivity has become more sensitive to\
    \ climate over time."
  5: TFPC sensitivity to climate variables has greatly increased in more recent times
    (1981-2010) compared to the 1951-1980 period.
  7: "Climate impacts on TFPC substantially increased in 1981\u20132010 compared to\
    \ 1951\u20131980. Technological advances also played a significant role in agricultural\
    \ productivity growth."
  8: Climate change impacts on agriculture and livestock, leading to economic risks
    and losses.
  9: TFPC sensitivity to climate has radically enhanced in 1981-2010 compared with
    the earlier period (1951-1980).
  10: TFP loss is increasing over time, with potential economic impacts amplified
    by climate uncertainty; climate penalties are expected to reduce TFP at greater
    rates than in recent decades.
  11: Increased irrigation has historically mitigated the impact of precipitation
    changes on productivity, but future water scarcity could exacerbate TFP reductions;
    adaptation may lower TFP losses but is unpredictable; regulatory effects and trade
    regulations may indirectly influence TFP.
  14: The RCP8.5 scenario leads to a greater negative change compared to RCP4.5 in
    the variable being measured, with the most significant differences appearing in
    the 2030-2040 period.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis uses a multivariate regression model to predict the growth of agricultural
    TFP based on historical climate relationships.
  2: Analysis of correlation between national TFPC with seasonal and geographic distributions
    of climate variables (temperature and precipitation anomalies); Development of
    a multivariate regression model to predict national aggregate agricultural TFP
    growth.
  3: Correlation analysis of regional climate indices (temperature and precipitation)
    with national TFPC over two 30-year periods (1951-1980 and 1981-2010).  Analysis
    focuses on geographic distributions of these correlations to identify key regions
    where climate significantly impacts national TFPC.
  4: Regression models are developed using seasonal temperature and precipitation
    averages over 10 regions to create climate indices affecting TFPC. A running correlation
    analysis is performed over 20-year periods. Models simulate TFPC from 1951-1980
    and 1981-2010, and simulations are compared to historical records.
  5: "Model simulations are used to estimate the impact of climate variables on TFPC,\
    \ assuming technological advances and adaptation practices remain the same as\
    \ in 1981\u20132010."
  7: "Regression analysis is used to model the relationship between climate indices\
    \ and TFPC for two periods: 1951\u20131980 and 1981\u20132010. Stepwise and Lasso\
    \ regressions are employed. The models are applicable to the US agricultural sector."
  8: Global gridded crop model intercomparison (Rosenzweig et al., 2014).
  9: Uses correlation analysis between Total Factor Productivity Change (TFPC) in
    agriculture and climate indicators (temperature and precipitation) over time.
    CMIP5 climate simulations under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios are used to project
    future climate change and potential TFPC responses. Regression models are used
    to project potential TFPC responses.
  10: Uses ensemble means from regression-based projections; relies on observed relationships
    between climate variability and economic response, applicable until climate anomalies
    exceed historical magnitudes.
  11: "Uses stepwise and lasso regression analyses to model the relationship between\
    \ climate indices and Total Factor Productivity (TFPC) in US agriculture. Analyzes\
    \ data from 1951-1980 and 1981-2010. Averages the TFPC-climate relationship observed\
    \ in 1981\u20132010."

More Notes:
  2: Technological improvement, adaptation, and CO2 fertilization are considered long-term
    factors influencing TFP growth.
  3: Regional climate impacts on TFPC are complex and depend on crop type. Heat stress
    can negatively impact major grain crops and confined animal operations.  The relationship
    between climate and productivity varies significantly by region due to different
    dominant crops and farming practices. Findings applicable to US.
  4: The analysis focuses on US agriculture and may not be directly transferable to
    other sectors or countries without modification. The increased role of climate
    from 1971 onward is linked to the accelerated growth of crop production compared
    to livestock.
  5: The study projects future TFP variations through 2050 under different RCP scenarios
    (4.5 and 8.5), showing a declining trend in TFP. The United States has a long
    history of heavy public investment in agricultural research and development, which
    has contributed to sustained US agricultural productivity growth and an increasing
    supply of US agricultural products.
  7: The study uses bootstrap samples to assess the robustness of the regression models.
    The authors acknowledge funding from USDA and NSF.
  9: The study focuses on the US agricultural sector. The increasing reliance on crop
    production likely caused TFPC sensitivity to increase because crops are generally
    more sensitive to weather than livestock. The largest contributor to the climate
    penalty is the projected increase in summer temperature over the agricultural
    heartland.
  10: Difference between yield and productivity is highlighted, with TFP loss responding
    more substantially to climate changes due to additional costs of maintaining yields.
  11: The models do not account for evolving climate sensitivity or adaptation measures.
    Policy effects (e.g., biofuel mandates) on TFPC are not fully established. Trade
    is unlikely to be a viable means of reversing TFP loss. There was no persistent
    correlation between agricultural international trade and TFPC.
  14: Uncertainty is represented by dashed lines on the bar graph, suggesting a range
    of possible outcomes. The uncertainty of climate projections is based on the 25th
    and 75th percentile GCM results.
Outcome(s) of Interest:

    represents around 70% of variance.  Correlation coefficients (R) and p-values
    are provided for both models. Regression variance explained, residual, and total
    variance are given for each period.
  5: Climate trends have caused a net TFP loss of 0.0003846 per year, which has been
    outweighed by a technological gain of 0.014865 per year.
