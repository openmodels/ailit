Drivers of Risk:
  1: Weather changes, specifically average temperature (T) and total precipitation
    (P) during the green season (5-month period centered around the greenest month).
  2: The evolution of global average annual temperature and annual precipitation are
    considered as potential drivers.  CMIP6 models (seven GCMs) are used to model
    these drivers.
  4: Warmer temperatures during the green season are detrimental to TFP growth. Precipitation
    has a non-linear effect, peaking around 500 mm over the green season.
  5: Temperature variables (Tmax, Tmean, Tmin) and anthropogenic climate change (ACC)
    are the primary drivers of risk considered.
  6: The paper highlights the impact of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) on agricultural
    output.
  8: Changes in temperature and precipitation during the green season (5-month period
    centred around the greenest month of the year) and, in some models, a brown (dry)
    season are used as drivers.

  28: Global impact of anthropogenic climate change
Highlights:
  1: Anthropogenic climate change has significantly slowed global agricultural productivity
    growth since 1961, with more severe impacts in warmer regions.
  2: Average agricultural TFP has more than doubled since 1961, but there is wide
    cross-country variation in TFP growth rates.
  4: Higher temperatures have become more damaging to agricultural TFP growth over
    time (comparing 1962-1988 to 1989-2015). ACC has resulted in a loss of the past
    7 years of productivity growth.
  5: Global agriculture is growing increasingly sensitive to ongoing climate change.  Impacts
    of ACC are greater for warm regions like Africa, Near East and North Africa, and
    Latin America and the Caribbean.  Ignoring input responses makes global impacts
    of ACC appear more severe; ACC would have reduced output by about 27.6% with a
    90% confidence interval between -48.3% and -14.3%.
  6: Localized productivity slowdowns and rapid pace of ACC may threaten 20th-century
    productivity rates.
  8: The core finding is the development of a response function relating changes in
    TFP to changes in temperature and precipitation. This function is then used to
    simulate the effect of climate change on global agricultural TFP.
  9: "The study finds that most model variations have little impact on the baseline\
    \ result, with revenue regression weights and the use of the \u2018green season\u2019\
    \ for weather aggregation being the most consequential modeling choices, generally\
    \ indicating slightly larger damage. Using only the greenest months may reduce\
    \ measurement error. Downweighting or excluding smaller countries in the regression\
    \ improves model fit, as they may have noisier data."

Methodology:
  1: Econometric model linking country-level TFP growth with weather change; Quadratic
    function of temperature and precipitation; Country-fixed and year-fixed effects
    used to control for technological change and global shocks; Estimates the effects
    of weather on TFP within countries and years.
  2: "The study uses country-level growth in agricultural TFP over 1961\u20132015.\
    \ Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset (GMFD) observations and CMIP6 models are\
    \ used to analyze temperature and precipitation."
  4: Econometric estimates are linked with counterfactual weather trajectories from
    CMIP6 climate experiments (with and without ACC) to derive the cumulative impact
    of ACC for each country since 1961. The analysis considers contemporaneous weather
    effects but finds no persistent effect of weather on TFP growth up to 10 years
    in the past.
  5: Econometric models with 96 variations were used, including variations in temperature
    variables, functional forms, regression weights, aggregation weights, growing
    season definitions, and heterogeneity assumptions. The analysis considers data
    from 1961 onwards. Tenfold cross-validation is performed to evaluate model fit.
  6: The study uses econometric estimates considering climate, econometric, and specification
    uncertainties.
  8: Uses an econometric model with country and year fixed effects to regress changes
    in TFP on first differences of green-season average temperature and precipitation,
    including quadratic terms. A block bootstrap estimation is used to capture statistical
    uncertainty.
  9: "The paper uses econometric analysis, including regressions based on mismatched\
    \ datasets to test the effect of weather, and a systematic exploration of 296\
    \ model variations to assess robustness. It considers different functional forms\
    \ for weather variables (quadratic or cubic), regression weights (equal or revenue),\
    \ weather data aggregation (cropland, or cropland and pasture; calendar year,\
    \ \u2018green season\u2019 or 2 3-month green/brown seasons), and response functions\
    \ (single global or separate latitudinal regions). The impact of ACC is calculated\
    \ by subtracting the cumulative impact of weather with ACC from the impact of\
    \ weather without ACC. They account for uncertainty from both the econometric\
    \ model and GCMs using 2,000 bootstrapped coefficients and GCM pairs. The impact\
    \ of different models on cumulative ACC impact is evaluated. They also implement\
    \ data restrictions including country exclusions and temporal subsets."

More Notes:
  5: The study notes that the analysis only removes the effect that fossil fuels and
    other anthropogenic influences have on temperature and does not reflect a world
    without fossil fuels.
  8: The study uses bias-corrected and spatially disaggregated (BCSD) climate data
    from CMIP6 GCMs. The study focuses on accounting for contemporaneous regional
    dependence in their block bootstrap estimation. Measurement error in TFP is considered
    but deemed unlikely to bias results significantly.
  9: The paper addresses potential measurement error in weather variables and TFP.
    Classical measurement error in weather variables would bias findings towards zero.
    Measurement error in TFP uncorrelated with weather does not introduce bias. Irrigation
    is considered as a potential factor. The paper emphasizes that regressions are
    based on TFP growth rates, not levels.
