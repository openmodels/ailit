Drivers of Risk:
  1: Anthropogenic climate change (ACC) impacts historical climate trends affecting
    productivity growth due to changes in global weather patterns.
  2: Temperature, Precipitation, Climate Change (inferred from mentioning CMIP6 models)
  3: Changes in green-season average temperature (T) and precipitation (P)
  4: Warmer temperatures during the green season and precipitation changes. Anthropogenic
    Climate Change (ACC).
  5: Anthropogenic Climate Change (ACC) driven by fossil fuels.
  6: Anthropogenic climate change (ACC) causing a drift away from a climate system
    without human influences.
  8: Changes in temperature and precipitation (weather shocks).
  9: Adverse impacts of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) through weather fluctuations
    (temperature and precipitation).
  10: No relevant information
  13: Changes in weather, specifically green-season average temperature (T) and total
    precipitation (P).
  15: Changes in green-season average temperature (T) and green-season total precipitation
    (P).
  17: Changes in green-season average temperature (T) and total precipitation (P)
  19: Changes in green-season average temperature (T) and changes in green-season
    total precipitation (P)
  21: Changes in green-season average temperature (T) and green-season total precipitation
    (P)
  23: Changes in green-season average temperature (T) and green-season total precipitation
    (P)
  27: Changes in green-season average temperature (T) and total precipitation (P)
    are considered drivers of risk.
Highlights:
  1: ACC has slowed global agricultural productivity growth, disproportionately affecting
    warmer regions, making global agriculture more vulnerable to climate change.
  2: Agricultural TFP has more than doubled since 1961, but there is wide cross-country
    variation.
  3: A robust relationship between agricultural TFP growth and weather changes is
    found.
  4: Warmer temperatures over the green season are detrimental to TFP growth. Agriculture
    is becoming more sensitive to climatic extremes, with higher temperatures becoming
    more damaging. Global agricultural productivity has been reduced by about 7 years
    due to anthropogenic climate change.
  5: ACC has a significant negative impact on global TFP, with warm regions being
    more affected; Ignoring input responses makes the impacts of ACC appear more severe.
  6: ACC is detectably and significantly reducing agricultural output by 2020. Current
    investments in agricultural research may be insufficient to sustain twentieth-century
    productivity growth rates.
  8: The paper estimates the effect of weather on agricultural TFP growth. Focus is
    on green and brown seasons. Measurement error in the TFP would need to be correlated
    with temperature and precipitation to induce bias. Measurement error in weather
    data would induce attenuation bias.
  9: ACC has a negative impact on agricultural TFP. The adoption of revenue regression
    weights and using the green season for weather aggregation represent the two most
    consequential modeling choices, pointing to slightly larger damage. Most model
    variations have relatively little bearing on the baseline result.
  10: No relevant information
  13: There is a documented impact on agricultural productivity due to changes in
    weather, with specific focus on the effect of temperature and precipitation.
  15: Shows the response of agricultural productivity (TFP) to green-season temperature
    and precipitation. Provides a baseline response function with all countries and
    also explores the sensitivity of the response function by excluding 10% of the
    hottest countries. Placebo tests provide evidence for the robustness of the results.
  17: The paper analyzes the response of agricultural productivity, represented by
    TFP, to weather variables (temperature and precipitation) during the green season.
  19: The paper analyzes how agricultural productivity (measured by TFP) responds
    to weather conditions during the green season. It provides response functions
    for temperature and precipitation, illustrating the marginal effects on TFP. Placebo
    tests are conducted to assess the robustness of the findings.
  21: The paper analyzes how agricultural productivity, measured by Total Factor Productivity
    (TFP), responds to changes in temperature and precipitation during the green season.
    Placebo tests indicate the relationships are unlikely to be spurious.

    (T) and green-season total precipitation (P) and country-level Total Factor Productivity
    (TFP) between 1989 and 2015.
  27: The paper investigates the response of agricultural productivity (measured by
    TFP) to changes in temperature and precipitation during the green season. The
    response functions are centered vertically so that the exposure-weighted marginal
    effect is zero.
  28: The average mean impact of the 288 models is highlighted with confidence intervals,
    and the reduction in out-of-sample MSE indicates better model fit.
Methodology:
  1: Develops an econometric model linking country-level TFP growth with weather changes,
    using counterfactual climate scenarios to assess past climate impacts.
  2: Analysis of agricultural TFP growth from 1961-2015 using country-level data.
    Exploring variations of the model by estimating separate response functions for
    various sub-regions of the world.
  3: The response functions are based on 500 year-by-region block bootstraps, and
    placebo checks involving reshuffling TFP and weather data by years or country
    are performed.
  4: Econometric estimates are linked with counterfactual weather trajectories from
    CMIP6 climate experiments (with and without ACC) to derive the cumulative impact
    of ACC. Placebo checks were also performed.
  5: Econometric models are used to estimate the impact of ACC on TFP and output;
    Models vary in temperature variable used (Tmax, Tmean, Tmin), functional form
    (Quadratic, Cubic), Regression weights (Equal, Revenue), Aggregation weights (Cropland,
    Cropland and pasture), Growing season (Calendar year, Green season), and Heterogeneity
    (Pooled, By latitude (3)); Models are validated using tenfold cross-validation;
    Impacts are estimated at a global and regional level; The analysis is based on
    data from 1961-2015, though results using data from 1989-2015 suggest larger damages.
  6: Econometric analysis using Total Factor Productivity (TFP) metric. The paper
    acknowledges potential measurement error in the TFP metric. The study ignores
    the direct effect of rising CO2 concentrations on agricultural production, agricultural
    research, or carbon-intensive inputs. The paper also does not remove the impact
    of irrigation water use. Ignoring all measured inputs overstates ACC impacts.
  8: Econometric regression analysis using historical weather data and agricultural
    TFP data from 172 countries over 1962-2015. It uses bias-corrected spatial disaggregation
    (BCSD) to downscale climate model data and a block bootstrap estimation to account
    for regional dependence. The regression model includes country and year fixed
    effects. They perform placebo checks.
  9: The study uses econometric analysis to model the impact of weather variables
    on agricultural TFP growth. It conducts robustness checks by exploring 296 variations
    of the econometric model. It also accounts for statistical uncertainty from the
    econometric model and climate uncertainty arising from various GCMs in CMIP6.
  10: No relevant information
  13: The analysis uses response functions to evaluate changes in country-level TFP
    with green-season average T and P, and applies block bootstraps for confidence
    intervals and reshuffles data for robustness checks.
  15: Regression analysis of TFP on temperature and precipitation with year-by-region
    and country level block bootstraps. Placebo checks performed by randomly reshuffling
    TFP and weather data by years and by country.
  17: Analysis uses data from 1962-1988. Response functions are centered vertically
    so that the exposure-weighted marginal effect is zero. Confidence bands are based
    on 500 year-by-region block bootstraps. Placebo checks involve randomly mismatching
    TFP and weather data by years and by country, with 10,000 reshuffled datasets.
  19: Regression analysis of country-level TFP on green-season average temperature
    and total precipitation for 1989-2015, with a comparison to a baseline period
    of 1962-2015. Year-by-region and country reshuffling placebo checks performed
    with 10,000 iterations.
  21: Regression analysis of country-level TFP changes in response to green-season
    average T and total P from 1962-1988, with robustness checks using year-by-region
    block bootstraps and placebo checks by reshuffling data by years and by country.
  23: The analysis examines the response of country-level TFP to weather changes between
    1989-2015. The response functions are generated using country-level data, with
    bootstrapping used to generate confidence intervals. Placebo checks involving
    random reshuffling of TFP and weather data by year and by country are also performed
    to test the robustness of the results.
  27: The analysis uses data from 1989-2015. Bootstrapping methods are used to generate
    confidence bands. Placebo checks are performed by reshuffling TFP and weather
    data.
  28: The analysis uses a range of 298 econometric models, with a focus on cross-validation
    to assess model fit by comparing to a baseline model that excludes weather variables.
More Notes:
  1: The econometric model combines weather effects on TFP with counterfactual climate
    scenarios, highlighting the macroeconomic implications of ACC on agriculture.
  2: The analysis uses the Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset (GMFD) for temperature
    and precipitation data. The study acknowledges that simple averages of country-level
    variables over-represent small countries.
  3: TFP has grown much more slowly in certain countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan
    Africa.
  5: The study focuses on the effect of anthropogenic influences on temperature and
    its impact on agricultural production. It does not simulate the effect of a world
    without fossil fuels. The response function is changing over time, suggesting
    that global agriculture is growing increasingly sensitive to ongoing climate change.
  6: The study acknowledges limitations related to the TFP metric and other factors,
    suggesting further research with more detailed international TFP statistics is
    needed.
  8: The paper acknowledges potential measurement errors in TFP, particularly concerning
    irrigation water use. The study uses a Cobb-Douglas production function as a basis
    for TFP calculation.
  9: The study addresses measurement error in weather variables and TFP. The study
    also explores the impact of input responses (e.g., irrigation) on the estimated
    sensitivity to weather conditions.

Outcomes of Interest:
  1: "ACC has reduced global agricultural TFP by about 21% since 1961, with more severe\
    \ effects in warmer regions like Africa and Latin America (~26\u201334% reduction)."
Quantitative material:
  1: ACC reduced global agricultural TFP by about 21% since 1961, equivalent to losing
    the last 7 years of productivity growth.
  2: Figure 1a shows average agricultural TFP has more than doubled since 1961.
  3: Figure 2 shows the response function of TFP growth to changes in green-season
    average T and P.
  4: Cumulative impact of ACC on global agricultural TFP growth over 1961-2020 is
    about -20.8% (90% confidence interval between -39.1% and -10.1%). Global TFP level
    projected for 2020 with ACC would have been reached in 2013 without ACC.
  5: Average mean impact of ACC on global TFP is -16.9% with a standard deviation
    of 5.9%; Cumulative impact of ACC since 1961 on TFP in Africa is -34.0%, Near
    East and North Africa is -30.0%, Latin America and the Caribbean is -25.9%, North
    America is -12.5%, and Europe and Central Asia is -7.1%; Ignoring input responses,
    ACC would have reduced output by about 27.6% with a 90% confidence interval between
    -48.3% and -14.3%; Baseline model indicates a 20.8% reduction based on TFP.
  6: ACC is increasingly reducing agricultural output, with a detectable and sizeable
    impact as of 2020. Impact estimates for each region reflecting various sources
    of uncertainty. The coloured bands represent 95%, 90% and 80% confidence intervals
    (CIs) that reflect climate uncertainty (from GCMs), econometric uncertainty (from
    the estimation) and specification uncertainty (from the choice of the econometric
    model). The colour in the map corresponds to the ensemble mean impact for each
    country based on these three sources of uncertainty.
