Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (water runoffs), electricity prices, market liberalization
  2: Climate change influence on hydropower potential and electricity price fluctuations.
  3: Runoff, wholesale electricity prices, and supply schedules
  4: 'Three GHG emission scenarios are considered: A1B, A2, and RCP3PD (also named
    RCP2.6).'
  5: Climate change impacts on runoff due to temperature and precipitation changes,
    glacier melt, and snow cover.
  7: Uncertainty of future prices, interannual and intra-annual variability. The models
    also consider that price is attracted by production cost, and shocks may perturb
    the price.
  8: "Water intake [m3 s\u22121]"
  9: Changes in runoff due to glacier melt and precipitation patterns, air temperature
  10: GHG emission scenarios, downscaling methods (EDDM and DCM).
  11: Changes in runoff due to melting glaciers (affected by GHG emission scenarios),
    interannual variability of electricity prices.
  12: The drivers of risk are different GHG emission scenarios (A1B, A2, RCP3PD),
    downscaling methods (MRy, MRs, MRJD, EDDM, DCM), and initial ice volume. Electricity
    price is also a factor.
  13: Uncertainty in runoff and electricity prices are key drivers of risk. Price
    is the most important factor for determining future revenue, but also the least
    predictable. GHG emissions and electricity prices are key considerations. Initial
    ice volume and downscaling methods are also risk factors.
  14: GHG emission scenarios, downscaling methods, and socio-economic variables are
    drivers of uncertainty.
  15: Runoff and electricity prices are drivers of risk affecting hydropower revenue.
    Uncertainty in energy price is identified as more critical than runoff uncertainty.
  18: Mentions climate change, warming climate, and hydro-climatic contexts.

Highlights:
  1: 'Greenhouse gas scenarios may represent a low source of uncertainty, unlike electricity
    prices. Main uncertainties are case study related and depend on the investigated
    variables. The nature of uncertainty evolves: Runoff uncertainty goes from variability
    to epistemic; electricity price uncertainty exhibits the reverse.'
  2: GHG emission scenarios show limited impact on long-term uncertainty; greatest
    uncertainty is related to electricity prices.
  4: No relevant information
  7: The analysis quantifies the impact of price uncertainty, interannual/intra-annual
    variability, and shock events on hydropower revenue using three different models.
  8: No relevant information
  9: Operators have taken advantage of glacier melting, which increases the annual
    volume of water. This trend will persist for the next 20 years, after which annual
    runoff will decrease. By 2100, glaciers are expected to disappear in the catchment
    area. The reservoir may mitigate the effects resulting from the runoff seasonality.
  10: Runoff increases slightly until 2040 compared to present-day conditions and
    decreases afterwards. GHG emission scenario largely affects the warming, but represents
    a low source of uncertainty in terms of runoff. The downscaling method affects
    the mean runoff more than the GCM-RCM choice.
  11: "Climate change affects mean annual revenue, but variation between GHG emission\
    \ scenarios is low (2071\u20132100); Runoff resulting from melting glacier will\
    \ be low because of glacier exhaustion (A1B and A2) or air temperature."
  12: Uncertainty from different GCM-RCMs is higher than the difference between GHG
    emission scenarios, implying that studies based on few climate models have high
    epistemic uncertainty. Initial ice volume uncertainty is lower than that from
    downscaling methods. EDDM downscaling tends to smooth revenue evolution. Electricity
    price models are conservative and do not show strong trends.
  13: The uncertainty in electricity prices is a major factor impacting long-term
    hydropower revenue predictions, more so than GHG emission scenarios. The level
    of uncertainty should be factored into climate and energy policy, and scenario
    planning should be used.
  14: Runoff uncertainty evolves with time, shifting from variability to epistemic
    in the long run. Electricity price uncertainty follows the reverse trend, shifting
    from epistemic to variability in the long run. Revenue uncertainty is a combination
    of both epistemic and variability. Information about the nature and level of uncertainty
    is valuable to decision-makers.
  15: Uncertainty analysis is a critical issue for the future of hydropower. Decision-makers
    cannot avoid uncertainty. Specific tools must be developed to tackle uncertainty
    in hydropower revenue forecasting. Managing variability is essential for accounting
    for epistemic uncertainty.
  18: Focus on climate change impacts on hydropower management and potential, water
    resource management, and glacier dynamics.
Methodology:
  1: Mixed method (quantitative and qualitative). Quantitative uses established models
    in natural sciences and economics with various scenarios and datasets. Qualitative
    analysis discerns three dimensions of uncertainty.
  2: Mixed methods approach considering both quantitative and qualitative uncertainty
    analysis; uses a variety of scenarios and models.
  3: 'Simulates future hydropower revenue. Uses a three-dimensional approach to uncertainty:
    Location, Level, and Nature. Analyzes long-term trends with socio-economic components,
    uncoupled from purely quantitative results.'
  4: "Climate data is provided by the ENSEMBLES project (2013) for 10 combinations\
    \ of global and regional climate models (GCM-RCM), which have a grid of 25 km\
    \ \xD7 25 km."
  5: The study uses downscaled climate scenarios (DCM and EDDM) to force a glacio-hydrological
    model (GERM) that simulates runoff. Future time series are downscaled from climate
    scenarios and past meteorological data is from MeteoSwiss stations (1980-2100).
    The glacier and runoff model requires calibration of parameters based on past
    ice volume changes, mass balance, and runoff records. Wholesale electricity prices
    are modeled using EEX German electricity spot prices.
  6: The models consider the logarithm of prices to maintain stable variance and use
    ARMA(1,1)-GARCH(1,1) for short-term volatility due to its suitability for high
    volatility markets.
  7: Three mean-reversing models (MRy, MRs, MRJD) are used to analyze price fluctuations.
    MRy assumes a stable yearly price with consistent intra-annual profiles. MRs allows
    for seasonal price changes. MRJD considers production cost attraction and price
    shocks using a jump diffusion model.
  8: The study optimizes hydropower plant management using a local search method (Threshold
    Accepting) over a two-year time horizon, validating the first year and moving
    the window for subsequent optimization. It assumes a clear-sighted manager with
    perfect knowledge of future prices and runoff. The objective function maximizes
    profit, considering water flow, hydraulic head, and electricity spot price. The
    optimization is subject to constraints on reservoir content limits.
  9: A management model was validated using historical data by comparing simulated
    and actual hourly, weekly, and seasonal production, and lake level patterns. The
    study considers 10 GCM-RCM with 10 paths for each.
  10: 'Analysis uses a large set of GCM-RCMs and compares two downscaling methods:
    EDDM and DCM.  Results are applicable to runoff into the Mauvoisin reservoir under
    different GHG emission scenarios (A1B, A2, RCP3PD) from 2021-2100.'
  11: Uses price models validated against historical prices, checking daily, weekly,
    and seasonal variations; Compares trends from different scenarios rather than
    reviewing numbers in isolation to investigate uncertainty.
  12: The analysis uses different GCM-RCMs, downscaling methods, and initial ice volume
    assumptions to project annual revenue from electricity generation. The models
    are conservative and do not consider drift in electricity prices.
  13: The paper compares various models and scenarios to assess uncertainty, classifying
    it as statistical, scenarios, and ignorance, and distinguishing between epistemic
    and variability uncertainty. The analysis considers different GHG emission scenarios
    and price models for the period 2071-2100, and compares it to a baseline period
    of 1981-2010.
  14: The analysis uses a large panel of GCM-RCM to limit uncertainty in runoff estimates.
    Statistical methods are used for parameter determination. The paper discusses
    uncertainty over different time horizons (medium-term and long-run).
  15: The paper uses a model that integrates runoff and electricity prices to evaluate
    revenue. It then carries out an uncertainty analysis.
  18: Includes modeling of management strategy, physically based glacier surface melt
    models, optimization heuristics, and scenario analysis.
More Notes:
  4: Downscaling is necessary because the horizontal resolution of 25km x 25km is
    insufficient to consider local characteristics, especially in mountain areas.
  7: The equations provide the mathematical formulation of the models.
  8: The paper focuses on trends in hydropower plant management rather than forecasting
    exact future revenue. The assumption of perfect foresight is used for computational
    efficiency.
  9: The case study is based on the Mauvoisin hydropower plant in the Swiss Alps.
    A new pumped-storage may even be built from 2040 on the surface released by the
    glacier, therefore increasing energy production on the site.
  10: Studies based on few GCM-RCMs suffer of high epistemic uncertainty.
  12: Annual revenue is not linearly related to annual runoff.
  13: The paper emphasizes the importance of considering various uncertainties, including
    those related to climate, energy policy, models, and inputs (runoff, electricity
    prices). The nature of uncertainty changes over time, from epistemic in the medium
    term to variability in the long term.
  14: The paper distinguishes between epistemic uncertainty (reducible through improved
    models) and variability (addressable through business and regulatory strategies).
    It suggests that different tools are needed to manage different levels of uncertainty
    (statistical, scenario-based, and ignorance).
  18: The focus is primarily on water resources and hydropower, particularly in alpine
    and glacierized regions. Several papers by Gaudard et al. appear relevant.
Quantitative material:
  1: The paper assesses how climate change and market fluctuation affect annual revenue,
    focusing on uncertainty rather than forecasting.
  2: Simulations based on a comprehensive range of parameters including 3 GHG emission
    scenarios, 10 combinations of climate models, 2 downscaling methods, 2 initial
    ice volumes, and 3 electricity price models.
  3: The quantitative model computes the expected annual revenue and its standard
    deviation.
