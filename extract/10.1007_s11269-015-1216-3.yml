Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (specifically changes in water runoffs) and market liberalization
    (leading to fluctuating electricity prices) are drivers of risk.
  2: Climate change (affecting water runoff) and power market fluctuations (electricity
    prices).
  4: The page discusses different climate scenarios (A1B, A2, and RCP3PD) which represent
    varying levels of global warming impacts.
  9: Climate change impacts including glacier melting and changes in runoff affect
    hydropower production.
  10: GHG emission scenarios, downscaling method (EDDM vs. DCM), GCM-RCM model choice,
    initial ice volume.
  11: Climate change, variability in GHG emission scenarios, interannual variability
    of electricity prices, glacier melting affecting runoff.
  12: Climate change, specifically driven by different RCM-GCM models, downscaling
    methods (DCM, EDDM, MRy, MRs, MRJD), initial ice volume, GHG emission scenarios
    (A1B, A2, RCP3PD), and electricity prices.
  13: Uncertainty in electricity prices and revenue due to price volatility and market
    changes.
  14: GHG emission scenarios, downscaling method impacts on runoff, socio-economic
    variables
  15: Uncertainty in runoff and electricity prices.
Highlights:
  1: Greenhouse gas scenarios may represent a low source of uncertainty compared to
    electricity prices. The main uncertainties are case-study related and depend on
    the investigated variables. Runoff uncertainty shifts from variability (inherent
    randomness) to epistemic (limitation of science), while electricity price uncertainty
    shifts the other way.
  2: Climate change influences runoff but has a limited impact on long-term revenue
    uncertainty. The greatest area of uncertainty is electricity prices, which can
    jeopardize future investments.
  9: Operators have been taking advantage of glacier melting, which increases the
    annual volume of water, but this trend is expected to reverse in the second half
    of the century. The reservoir can mitigate the effects resulting from the runoff
    seasonality.
  10: Runoff is projected to increase slightly until 2040, then decrease by a similar
    value by the end of the century. GHG emission scenarios have a relatively low
    impact on runoff compared to other factors, such as the choice of GCM-RCM model
    and downscaling method. The downscaling method has a higher impact on mean runoff
    than the choice of GCM-RCM.
  11: "Climate change impacts mean annual revenue, especially during 2071\u20132100\
    \ due to glacier exhaustion; electricity price variability overtakes other uncertainties."
  12: Uncertainty from climate models is higher than uncertainty from GHG emissions
    scenarios. The uncertainty brought by the initial ice volume is not as high as
    the uncertainty resulting from the downscaling method.
  13: Future revenue from hydropower is mainly determined by electricity prices, which
    are highly unpredictable.
  14: Uncertainty in runoff evolves with time, shifting from variability to epistemic;
    Electricity price uncertainty shifts from epistemic to variability; Revenue uncertainty
    is induced by future runoff and electricity price uncertainty
  15: Price uncertainty is far more critical than runoff uncertainty.
Methodology:
  1: 'The paper uses a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative modeling with
    qualitative analysis. Uncertainty is accounted for by applying various scenarios
    and datasets from different models. Uncertainty is analyzed through three dimensions. '
  2: Quantifies revenue impact, compares results, and performs a qualitative analysis
    of uncertainty. Uses mixed methods to integrate results from natural sciences
    and economics.
  4: The analysis uses climate data from the ENSEMBLES project with 10 combinations
    of global and regional climate models, and notes the use of downscaling due to
    insufficient horizontal resolution for capturing local variability.
  9: A model is validated using historical data to compare simulated and actual hydropower
    production. The study considers climate change scenarios (A2, A1B, RCP3PD) and
    10 GCM-RCMs with 10 paths for each.
  10: "Uses General Circulation Model-Regional Climate Model (GCM-RCM) data with two\
    \ downscaling methods (EDDM and DCM) to forecast runoff under different GHG emission\
    \ scenarios (A1B, A2, RCP3PD). The analysis covers the periods 2021\u20132050\
    \ and 2071\u20132100, compared to a baseline of 1981-2010."
  11: Analysis comparing different electricity price scenarios, GHG emission scenarios,
    and downscaling methods; sensitivity analyses on initial ice volume.
  12: The analysis computes annual revenue from electricity generation under different
    climate scenarios, downscaling methods, and initial conditions. The results are
    applicable to the specific context and models used in the study.
  13: Analysis of uncertainty in hydropower revenue with a focus on statistical, scenario,
    and epistemic nature, compared by using various models.
  14: Statistical methods including calibration techniques, considers a large panel
    of GCM-RCM
  15: The paper uses a model that integrates runoff and electricity prices to evaluate
    revenue, and carries out an uncertainty analysis. Specific tools must be developed
    in order to tackle uncertainty.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on uncertainty rather than forecasting.
  2: The paper aims to address the lack of comprehensive uncertainty analyses in the
    field.
  9: A new pumped-storage may even be built from 2040 on the surface released by the
    glacier, increasing energy production.
  10: The study emphasizes the epistemic uncertainty arising from GCM-RCM choice and
    downscaling methods. Using a large set of GCM-RCM models can reduce this uncertainty.
  11: Interannual revenue variability may surpass expected revenue due to price volatility;
    the shape of glaciers impacts hydropower results.
  12: Annual revenue is not linearly related to annual runoff.
  13: Market architecture and structure are evolving, making long-term electricity
    price predictions difficult.
  14: Information about uncertainty is valuable to decision-makers; Improving models
    reduces epistemic uncertainty; Business and regulatory strategies can address
    variability.
  15: Decision-makers cannot avoid uncertainty, but specific tools can be developed
    to tackle it. Addressing epistemic uncertainty requires managing variability through
    market design, risk-hedging tools, energy policy, and regulatory frameworks that
    increase flexibility (e.g., water rights, legal frameworks).
