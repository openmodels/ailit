Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa.
  2: Changes in weather variables, specifically vapor pressure deficit, wet day frequency,
    and temperature
  3: Temperature increase, increase in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and changes in
    wet day frequency.
  7: "Average Temperature (\xB0C), Average Wet Days Frequency (WDF), Average Vapor\
    \ Pressure Deficit (VPD) (kPa)"
  8: Temperature (TEMP), Water Deficit Factor (WDF), Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD),
    and their squared terms (TEMPsq, WDFsq).
  9: Weather changes such as high temperatures, very wet conditions leading to flooding,
    and high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) impact agricultural outcomes.
  10: Temperature (TEMP), water deficit (WDF), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) are
    the primary drivers of risk considered, alongside income level.
  11: Temperature (TEMP), Water Deficit Factor (WDF), and Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD).
  12: Future changes in SSA climatic events, specifically changes in weather variables
    like precipitation and Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD).
  13: Climate change, specifically increased average temperature, changes in warm
    dry days (WDF), and changes in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) under the RCP8.5 scenario.
  14: "Warming temperatures reduce millet yield; Reduced rainfall diminishes benefits;\
    \ Flooding has an adverse spillover effect on next year\u2019s millet yield."
Highlights:
  1: The impacts of climate change on agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa are investigated.
  2: "Own-location weather variables have significant contemporaneous impacts on millet\
    \ yield; spatial and temporal spillovers exacerbate and attenuate wet day cumulative\
    \ effect, respectively; local crop production is affected by neighboring countries\u2019\
    \ production; results are robust across country-income groups."
  3: Temperature increase and increased VPD are associated with millet yield loss
    in SSA; increased wet day frequency improves output. The effect of temperature
    on millet yield differs between poor and rich SSA countries, with poor countries
    more adversely affected. Local yield levels are affected by millet yield production
    in neighboring regions.
  7: The study isolates the effect of random variation across selected weather variables
    on millet yield.
  8: The study finds evidence of spatial dependence in millet yield, ascertained via
    the classical Lagrange multiplier (LM) test. Temperature and WDF are negatively
    and positively related to millet yield, respectively. VPD is significantly and
    negatively related to millet yield. Technological and agronomic progress over
    time improves yield. The direct effects of the spatial specification differ from
    those of the NS specification.
  9: Direct effects of weather shocks are more substantial than indirect effects;
    spatial effects have significant implications on agricultural yield.
  10: Temperature increases adversely affect poor countries more than rich countries,
    although the significance is weak. The temporal and indirect lag effects of WDF
    decreased significantly when accounting for income differentiation. Baseline estimates
    are broadly similar across a range of empirical specifications (different model
    settings).
  11: The study does not find evidence that millet yield in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
    is affected by changes in 5-year and 10-year average weather conditions using
    LD and FLD approaches. Table 8 shows a qualitative similarity to baseline estimates
    with some weather coefficients changing noticeably.
  12: There is evidence of future regional warming, with the CCC model predicting
    the highest increase by 2069. The trend in predicted WDF varies across the GCMs,
    with PCM predicting an increase while others predict a decrease. Assuming present
    socio-economic conditions persist, the median impact on millet yields can be estimated,
    with uncertainty captured through bootstrapped prediction intervals. The authors
    find no evidence that SSA countries adapt during the period under review, either
    by way of technological advancement or knowledge accumulation.
  13: The CCC model projects the most severe impact on regional millet yields, with
    a worst-case scenario showing dire losses. Temperature increases are projected
    to be highest in northern and southern regions of Africa.
  14: Warming reduces millet yield; wet days improve millet output; spatial effects
    amplify the effect of wet day frequency. There is no evidence of adaptation to
    gradual climate changes.
Methodology:
  1: Spatial panel data approach.
  2: Spatial panel data approach controlling for spatial effects and spatio-temporal
    econometrics techniques, accounting for adaptation using long-term averages
  3: Spatio-temporal panel data model controlling for space and time, spatial lags
    of dependent variable and regressors, errors clustered at location level, temporal
    lags of regressors. Analysis of millet yield in Sub-Saharan Africa using data
    up to 2016.
  7: Panel data analysis with time trend, country fixed effects, and weather measures.
    Spatial interactions are corrected for using spatial weight matrices (inverse
    distance, 4-nearest neighbor, economic network). The analysis uses data from 31
    countries over 47 years (observations = 1457).
  8: "Spatial Durbin Model (SDM) with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) using the\
    \ splm package in R. Spatially-dependent errors are accounted for through clustering\
    \ at MPA level. The analysis also includes a non-spatial (NS) model for comparison.\
    \ Robustness is checked using alternative time trends, time lags, exclusion of\
    \ outlier country, different spatial weight, long differences approach, and \uFB02\
    exible long differences approach."
  9: Analysis uses spatial models (NS, SDM) to account for direct and spillover (indirect)
    effects of temperature and water deficit across regions with clustered errors.
  10: Panel data models are used to estimate the impact of weather shocks on millet
    yield, controlling for income levels. Different model specifications are used
    as robustness checks, including variations in time trends, spatial weights, and
    lag structures. The study also explores income differentiation by interacting
    weather variables with an indicator for 'poor' countries.
  11: The analysis uses non-spatial and spatial econometric models (long differences
    (LD), flexible long differences (FLD), and models with economic networks as spatial
    weights) to estimate the impact of weather conditions on millet yield. Different
    time periods (5-year and 10-year averages) are considered. The models in Table
    8 include time trend and its quadratic term.
  12: The study combines regression estimates from a baseline model with forecasted
    climatic changes derived from global climate models (GCMs). It incorporates climate
    and statistical uncertainties by deriving projected changes in weather variables
    under three climate change models and re-calibrating the baseline model with inputs
    from bootstrapped runs. It uses MPA-level daily mean precipitation forecasts to
    construct WDF values and derives VPD from daily MPA-level maximum and minimum
    temperatures. Bootstrapped estimates of average predicted impact are obtained
    by varying climate and a bootstrapped prediction interval is constructed.
  13: The paper uses general circulation models (GCMs) under the RCP8.5 scenario to
    project climate changes and their impacts on millet yields for the period 2040-2069,
    relative to a 1981-2010 baseline.

    on millet yield in SSA for 1970-2016.
More Notes:
  1: This is an open access article published in World Development. The article focuses
    on agriculture, suggesting a potential link to broader macroeconomic outcomes
    but doesn't provide specifics on this page.
  2: The study focuses on the impacts of climate change on agriculture, specifically
    pearl millet yield, in sub-Saharan Africa.
  3: The study focuses on millet due to its economic importance in SSA, but the analysis
    was extended to other cereal crops, with results available on request from the
    authors.
  7: "The study argues that including more controls (such as GDP and institutional\
    \ measures) will induce an \u2018\u2018over-controlling problem\u201D and that\
    \ soil quality is fixed over time and cannot be distinguished from country-specific\
    \ effects. The spatial weights cutoff is 910 km."
  10: The study acknowledges the challenge of accounting for adaptation in panel data
    models. It mentions the potential for fixed effects and time trends to absorb
    long-run atmospheric conditions, potentially underestimating climate change impacts.
    Alternative methods, like long differences (LD) and flexible long differences
    (FLD), are discussed as ways to account for adaptation.
  11: The study explores the potential impact of free trade among MPAs on crop yields.
    The spatial weights matrix for Table 8 is based on economic blocs in SSA.
  12: The study uses the business-as-usual scenario (RCP 8.5) and focuses on climate
    uncertainty by using forecasts from three GCMs (CCC, CCSR, and PCM). The assumption
    is made that climate will continue to affect agriculture in the future and that
    socio-economic conditions mimic past conditions.
  14: Accounting for the temporal effects of weather measures is necessary for generating
    a better estimate of the impact of climate change on agriculture in SSA. The CO2
    fertilization effect might not be that important for millet.
