Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increases in relative humidity and decreases in vertical wind shear are responsible
    for nearshore tropical cyclone intensification.
  4: Nearshore tropical cyclone (TC) intensification rates.
  8: Increased tropical cyclone (TC) intensification rates in nearshore regions due
    to climate change (SSP585 emissions scenario).
  10: Changes in diabatic heating, basic state atmospheric conditions, and transient
    forcing are identified as drivers of changes in vertical wind shear (VWS).
Highlights:
  1: Nearshore tropical cyclone intensification rates have increased globally over
    the 42-year period from 1979 to 2020, and climate models project continued increases
    due to decreasing wind shear.
  4: Nearshore TC intensification rates have changed between 1979-1999 and 2000-2020,
    with a statistically significant (p=0.04) difference in the mean intensification
    rate.
  7: "There has been a significant rise in the average intensification rate of nearshore\
    \ tropical cyclones on a global scale during 1979\u20132020."
  8: Tropical cyclones are projected to intensify faster in nearshore regions in the
    future (2015-2050) compared to the historical period (1979-2014). The increase
    in intensification rate is not uniform, with insignificant changes near the west
    coast of Mexico and the Australian coast.
  10: Changes in diabatic heating and basic state are the dominant factors shaping
    the spatial pattern of shear response over the Northern Hemisphere. The SWM can
    reproduce the overall spatial pattern of VWS changes, particularly over coastal
    areas characterized by decreasing VWS.
Methodology:
  1: "The analysis uses a suite of observations and numerical model simulations over\
    \ the period 1979\u20132020, with high-resolution climate models and idealized\
    \ numerical experiments."
  4: "Analyzes observed changes in global 24-hr TC intensification rates in nearshore\
    \ regions from 1979\u20132020 using IBTrACS data. A Student's t-test is used for\
    \ difference of means, and Monte Carlo methods are used for error estimation.\
    \ Data are sub-sampled to ensure similar storm state distributions."
  7: Analysis is based on Hadley SST data (Rayner et al., 2003) and NCEP-DOE II atmospheric
    reanalysis (Kanamitsu et al., 2002) for the period 1979-2020. Also uses simulations
    from HighResMIP (Haarsma et al., 2016), a subset of CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016).
    HighResMIP is used for a qualitative assessment only.
  8: "Analyzed TC track data from five fully coupled climate models (HighResMIP) under\
    \ the SSP585 scenario for the periods 1979-2014 and 2015-2050. Data was sub-sampled\
    \ to ensure statistical similarity of storm states and independence of track locations.\
    \ Nearshore regions are defined as within 3\xB0 of the coastline."
  10: The study uses CMIP6 models and a Stationary Wave Model (SWM) to simulate future
    climate under the SSP585 emissions scenario. It decomposes the effects of individual
    forcings (diabatic heating, basic state, and transient forcing) on VWS changes.
    Statistical significance is assessed using the Student's t-test.
More Notes:
  4: "The analysis focuses on the months of Jun\u2013October in the Northern Hemisphere\
    \ and December\u2013April in the Southern Hemisphere, when 90% of TCs tend to\
    \ occur. The nearshore region is defined as within 3\xB0 of the coastline."
  7: HighResMIP models simulate weaker changes in TC intensity compared to best track
    data, and are therefore only used for qualitative assessment. The findings raise
    questions about the probability that the trends will persist into the future and
    the possible contribution of anthropogenic forcing.
  8: The mean intensification rate in HighResMIP is weaker than observations, possibly
    due to limitations in simulating intense storms.
  10: The study identifies discrepancies between CMIP6 models and the SWM in certain
    regions, attributing these to the lack of coupling between zonal-mean flows, transient
    eddies, and diabatic heating in the SWM, as well as potential inaccuracies in
    the dissipation parameterization or missing physical processes.
