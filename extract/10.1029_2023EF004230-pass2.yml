Drivers of Risk:
  1: Decreases in vertical wind shear, increases in relative humidity, amplified warming
    in the upper troposphere, and changes in heating patterns.
  2: Rapid intensification of tropical cyclones (TCs) near coastlines.
  3: Changes in surface pressure, three-dimensional temperature, winds, zonally symmetric
    climate, topography, diabatic heating, transient eddies, zonal-mean basic state,
    anomalous basic state, diabatic heating, and transient forcing. Specifically looking
    at future (2081-2100) vs. near-future (2015-2034).
  4: Nearshore Tropical Cyclone (TC) intensification rates
  6: Trends in Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Vertical Wind Shear (VWS), and Relative
    Humidity (RH) are analyzed as drivers impacting storm development.
  7: Changes in SST, vertical wind shear, and relative humidity occurring between
    1979-2020
  8: Nearshore Tropical Cyclones (TCs) intensification is examined under the SSP585
    emissions scenario.
  9: Changes in SST, vertical wind shear (VWS), and relative humidity (RH) are identified
    as key drivers. Specifically, a stronger decrease in VWS and a larger increase
    in RH near the coast relative to offshore regions are responsible for the greater
    increase in nearshore TC intensification.
  10: Changes in diabatic heating and basic state are dominant in shaping the spatial
    pattern of vertical wind shear (VWS) response over the Northern Hemisphere.
  11: "Anthropogenic warming causes anomalous heating, which leads to changes in vertical\
    \ wind shear (VWS). Specifically, enhanced heating over the tropical eastern Pacific\
    \ and anomalous diabatic cooling over the tropical North Atlantic drive meridional\
    \ dipole-like responses of VWS over the Central and North American region. Climate\
    \ change-induced anomalous heating also affects VWS in Asia, decreasing it near\
    \ Taiwan and the southeastern coast of China but strengthening it over northeast\
    \ Asia and the northern Indian Ocean. Changes in zonal mean basic state decrease\
    \ VWS over Northeast Asia and the North Indian Ocean while slightly increasing\
    \ shear near 40\xB0N over North America. Enhanced static stability in the tropical-subtropical\
    \ troposphere is also a crucial factor in reducing VWS across Northeast Asia and\
    \ the North Indian Ocean."
  12: Heightened nearshore intensification rate of TCs, decrease in vertical wind
    shear (VWS) near coastal areas, faster warming in the tropical upper troposphere.

Highlights:
  1: Nearshore TC intensification rates have increased over the 42-year period 1979-2020.
    Climate models project a continued increase in nearshore TC intensification rates
    with decreasing wind shear playing a crucial role.
  2: "Examines observed changes in nearshore TC intensification and the large\u2010\
    scale environment over the historical period, projects changes into the future\
    \ using climate model simulations and delves into the responsible mechanisms using\
    \ idealized numerical modelexperiments."
  3: Investigates individual contributions of anomalous basic state, diabatic heating,
    and transient forcing to the projected response in VWS.
  4: Nearshore TC intensification rates reveal a noticeable change between 1979-1999
    and 2000-2020.
  6: The large-scale environment has become more favorable for storm development in
    the nearshore region compared to the offshore region, due to weakening of global
    nearshore VWS and increases in nearshore RH.
  7: "Significant rise in average intensification rate of nearshore TCs on a global\
    \ scale during 1979\u20132020. This increase is likely driven by interplay of\
    \ various environmental changes. HighResMIP models simulate weaker changes in\
    \ TC intensity compared to best track data."
  8: Probability distributions of TC intensification rates suggest that in the nearshore
    region, TCs will continue to strengthen faster in the future climate. Increases
    in mean intensification rate are observed in all coastal areas except near the
    west coast of Mexico and the Australian coast. The change in the nearshore region
    is greater than in the offshore region.
  9: The most significant increase in TC intensification occurs in proximity to the
    coastline. Near the US, East Asian, and South Asian coasts, there are substantial
    decreasing trends in VWS.
  10: The Stationary Wave Model (SWM) generally reproduces the overall spatial pattern
    of VWS changes, particularly over coastal areas characterized by decreasing VWS.
  11: "Anthropogenic warming leads to complex changes in vertical wind shear (VWS)\
    \ patterns across the globe. Over the US coast and Mexican west coast, the shear\
    \ response is linked to anomalous heating. The meridional dipole-like response\
    \ of VWS over the Central and North American region is mainly excited by enhanced\
    \ heating over the tropical eastern Pacific. Climate change-induced anomalous\
    \ heating has contrasting effects on VWS in various regions of Asia. An altered\
    \ zonal mean basic state is acting to decrease the VWS over Northeast Asia and\
    \ the North Indian Ocean, while simultaneously causing a slight increase in shear\
    \ near 40\xB0N over North America. Enhanced static stability plays a crucial role\
    \ in reducing the VWS across Northeast Asia and the North Indian Ocean."
  12: Nearshore intensification rate implies a potential strengthening of landfalling
    TCs' destructive capacity. A significant role is played by the decrease in VWS
    near coastal areas.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of observations, atmospheric reanalyses, and high-resolution climate
    model simulations. Idealized numerical experiments with an intermediate complexity
    model.
  2: Uses TC track data from IBTrACS and ADT-HURSAT to estimate intensification rates.
    Also uses climate model simulations from HighResMIP and CMIP6 to project future
    changes.
  3: "Uses the Stationary Wave Model (SWM) with R30 horizontal resolution and 24 vertical\
    \ sigma layers. Five independent integrations using the SWM: CTRL (2015-2034),\
    \ Future (2081-2100), CTRL+\u0394BS, CTRL+\u0394DH, and CTRL+\u0394TranF. TC intensification\
    \ rate is estimated as the linear regression coefficient of storm maximum wind\
    \ speed over five successive 6-hr track locations. Monte Carlo method used for\
    \ uncertainty estimation."
  4: "Analyzes observed changes in global 24-hr TC intensification rates in the nearshore\
    \ region over 1979\u20132020. Student\u2019s t-test for difference of means is\
    \ used to ascertain statistical significance. Monte Carlo method used for error\
    \ estimation. Data are sub-sampled to ensure statistically similar storm states\
    \ for the two periods. Jun\u2013October (Northern Hemisphere) and December-April\
    \ (Southern Hemisphere) are the months analyzed."
  6: Trends in SST, VWS, and RH were analyzed for the period 1979-2020. Data were
    averaged over June-October (Northern Hemisphere) and December-April (Southern
    Hemisphere). SST data are from the UK Met Office's Hadley Center, while atmospheric
    winds and humidity are from NCEP-DOE II reanalysis. Statistical significance is
    assessed at the 5% level.
  7: "Analysis based on Hadley SST and NCEP-DOEII atmospheric reanalysis. Trends are\
    \ averaged over June\u2013October (Northern Hemisphere) and December\u2013April\
    \ (Southern Hemisphere). HighResMIP simulations are used for qualitative assessment\
    \ of climate change impact on TC intensification."
  8: "TC track data from five fully coupled climate models belonging to HighResMIP\
    \ are used. The data are sub-sampled to ensure statistically similar distributions\
    \ of storm state for the two periods.  A distance threshold of ~3\xB0 is used\
    \ to identify \u201Cnearshore\u201D regions."
  10: "Analysis uses 15 CMIP6 models comparing near-future (2015\u20132034) and late\
    \ 21st century (2081\u20132100) periods under the SSP585 emissions scenario. A\
    \ Stationary Wave Model (SWM) is also used to decompose the effect of each forcing\
    \ mechanism."
  11: The analysis uses climate models and observational data to investigate the impact
    of anthropogenic warming on vertical wind shear (VWS). The study analyzes circulation
    responses at different levels using Gill's model solution as a framework. It also
    examines the role of heat-induced stationary baroclinic Rossby waves in driving
    VWS changes over Asia. The study explores the influence of altered zonal mean
    basic states on VWS changes in various regions. The analysis considers the effects
    of upper-level circulation changes and the coupling between vertical motion and
    rotational winds through Sverdrup balance. It also investigates the impact of
    increased warming in the upper troposphere on shear changes through sensitivity
    experiments. The timescale for the results would be the time frame of climate
    change projections.
  12: Analysis based on IBTrACS TC track data, ADT-HURSAT TC track data, Hadley SST
    data, NCEP-DOE II reanalysis, ERA5 reanalysis, HighResMIP TC track data, CMIP6
    data, and SWM simulations.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on nearshore tropical cyclone intensification, a relatively
    underexplored aspect of TC behavior in the context of climate change.
  2: The study focuses on tropical cyclones and their intensification, particularly
    near coastlines, examining both historical trends and future projections.
  3: "Defines nearshore as within 3\xB0 or about 200 nautical miles of the coastline."
  4: "Nearshore is defined as within 3\xB0 of the coastline. Analysis focuses on nearshore\
    \ regions around Central/South America, West/Southern Africa, Northern Australia/Southeast\
    \ Asia, and islands in the Indian/Western Pacific Oceans. Terms such as 'North\
    \ Atlantic' or 'Northwest Pacific' refer more generally to the various ocean regions,\
    \ which include the nearshore and offshore regions."
  6: Substituting ERA5 reanalysis data leads to consistent conclusions, indicating
    robustness to specific data sources.
  8: "The mean intensification rate in HighResMIP is weaker relative to observations,\
    \ likely due to limitations simulating intense storms. The future climate is based\
    \ on the SSP585 scenario. Locations where the intensity of the TC is below \u201C\
    Tropical Storm\u201D strength (34kt) are excluded."
  9: The global thresholds for sub-sampling are modified in each basin to account
    for regional variations in storm state.
  10: Discrepancies exist between CMIP6 models and SWM simulations, potentially due
    to the lack of coupling between zonal-mean flows, transient eddies, and diabatic
    heating in the SWM, as well as potential inaccuracies in dissipation parameterization
    or other missing physical processes.
  11: The page discusses the impact of climate change on vertical wind shear (VWS),
    which is an important factor in weather patterns. The changes are complex and
    vary regionally, with different mechanisms at play in different parts of the world.
    The circulation responses at different levels are largely consistent with Gill's
    model solution. The projected changes in heating patterns are predominantly governed
    by the spatial distribution of future SST warming.
