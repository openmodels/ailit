Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased wildfire risk and severity due to climate change, expansion of the
    wildland-urban interface, and questionable wildfire management practices.
  2: Increased PM2.5 exposure from wildland fire smoke; aridification intensifying
    with climate change
  3: Wildland fires leading to increased PM2.5 concentrations causing elevated air
    pollution levels.
  4: Wildland fires and associated smoke exposure.
  6: Wildland fires and associated PM2.5 exposure.
  9: Wildland fire PM2.5 exposure
Highlights:
  1: Wildfires account for a greater mortality and economic burden than indicated
    by earlier studies.
  2: Fire-only PM2.5 contributes between 6.9 and 49% of PM2.5 from all sources in
    California, depending on the severity of the fires each year. In 2008, 2017, and
    2018, fire-only PM2.5 was responsible for almost half of all sources PM2.5.
  3: Fire-only PM2.5 concentrations contribute to air pollution, with annual concentrations
    exceeding thresholds in rural regions.
  4: Mortality impacts from wildland fire smoke are substantial, and disproportionately
    high in high-fire years. Fires in high population areas lead to more attributable
    deaths.
  6: Wildland fires lead to significant economic costs due to premature mortality.
    The choice of dose-response value (wildfire-specific vs. undifferentiated) significantly
    affects the magnitude of the estimated impacts.
  9: Wildland fire PM2.5 exposures in California from 2008-2018 led to an estimated
    52,480 to 55,710 premature deaths, with an associated economic valuation of $432
    billion to $456 billion.
Methodology:
  1: "Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system wildland fire PM2.5 estimates,\
    \ ZIP code\u2013level mortality data, and a wildfire-specific dose-response coefficient\
    \ accounting for the likely toxicity of wildfire smoke are used to quantify the\
    \ mortality burden for PM2.5 exposure from California fires from 2008 to 2018."
  2: Uses modeled wildland fire-associated PM2.5 concentrations, high-resolution California
    Department of Public Health (CDPH) mortality data, and a calculated chronic dose-response
    coefficient for wildfire PM2.5 exposures and mortality to estimate premature deaths
    due to wildland fires over an 11-year period from 2008 to 2018.
  3: Analysis based on CMAQ model simulations of fire-only PM2.5 at a 12-km resolution
    across 11 years, using dose-response values to estimate mortality impacts.
  4: The study estimated total deaths attributable to fire-only PM2.5 for adults ages
    25+ using wildfire-specific and undifferentiated chronic dose-response values
    for 2008 to 2018. Modeled PM2.5 concentrations were capped at the 99.9th percentile.
    Short-term dose-response values were also used to estimate mortality.
  6: The study uses a wildfire-specific dose-response value to calculate the economic
    valuation of mortality impacts. CMAQ simulation is used. The analysis spans 2008-2018.
    Both a base case and a 'mod cap' scenario (with modeled values capped) are considered.
  9: "Health impact analysis applying CTM estimates of wildland fire PM2.5 to estimate\
    \ mortality outcomes using high-resolution health data.  Applies a chronic dose-response\
    \ value for wildfire-specific PM2.5 exposure. Data from 2008-2018, 12 km grid\
    \ spatial resolution. Uses U.S. EPA\u2019s CMAQ modeling system, SMARTFIRE2, CONSUME\
    \ version 3.0, and the Fuel Characteristic Classification System fuel-loading\
    \ database."
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on California and the period from 2008 to 2018.
  2: The study focuses on California.
  4: The paper focuses on health outcomes (mortality) rather than direct macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal outcomes. However, the mortality data could potentially be linked
    to economic impacts through lost productivity, healthcare costs, or other channels
    in further analysis. Spatial distribution of fires and mortality impacts are included
    in the supplementary information.
  9: The study focuses on California and acknowledges the importance of community
    resilience and protecting vulnerable populations. It also discusses the need for
    further research to directly investigate the chronic mortality effects of wildfire
    PM2.5.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic impact of premature deaths attributable to wildland fire PM2.5.
  2: No relevant information
  4: Premature deaths attributable to fire-only PM2.5.
  6: Economic valuation of mortality impacts from wildland fires (billion $).
  9: Economic valuation of mortality impacts associated with fire-only PM2.5 exposures.
Quantitative material:
  1: Economic impact of $432 to $456 billion (related to the premature deaths).
  3: Estimated annual mortality impacts due to fire-only PM2.5 exposure range from
    ~1240 deaths in 2010 to 12,850 in 2018.
  4: Premature deaths attributable to fire-only PM2.5 were estimated for 2008-2018
    in California. Total deaths attributable to undifferentiated PM2.5 from all sources
    were 290,540 over the 11-year period. Mortality impacts from wildland fire smoke
    are substantial, contributing to ~19% of PM2.5-associated deaths overall and up
    to 42% in high-fire years.
  6: "Economic valuation figures are presented for 2008-2018 (billion $). A base case\
    \ and 'mod cap' scenario are presented along with 95% confidence intervals. As\
    \ examples, the page mentions estimations of ~10,000 premature deaths in California\
    \ alone for 2008 in both scenarios. The paper indicates the 'mod cap' exceeds\
    \ 143 \u03BCg/m3. The paper mentions capping fire-only concentrations at the 99.9th\
    \ percentile."

    premature deaths attributable to fire-only PM2.5 exposures (2008-2018 in California).
