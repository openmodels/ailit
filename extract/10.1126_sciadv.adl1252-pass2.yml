Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, expansion of the wildland-urban interface, and questionable wildfire
    management practices.
  2: Wildland fire-associated PM2.5 concentrations drive mortality risk.
  4: Wildland fire smoke and fire-only PM2.5 concentrations.
  5: Modeled wildland fire PM2.5 estimates
  6: Wildland fires leading to PM2.5 exposure.
  7: The primary driver of risk is exposure to fire-specific PM2.5, particularly from
    wildfires (though prescribed burns are also included).
  8: Wildfire smoke exposure is the primary driver of risk, specifically wildfire
    PM2.5 concentrations.
  9: Wildland fire PM2.5 emissions are the primary driver of risk considered in this
    study.
  11: The driver of risk is PM2.5 concentration from wildland fire smoke.
  13: Wildfires and PM2.5 air pollution.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Mortality attributable to PM2.5 from wildland fires.
  2: This paper evaluates premature deaths due to wildland fire PM2.5 exposure in
    California.
  4: Mortality impacts across California due to fire-only PM2.5 (adults ages 25+).
  5: Total deaths attributable to fire - only PM2.5
  6: Economic valuation of mortality impacts from wildland fires.
  7: The paper evaluates mortality impacts, specifically focusing on long-term wildfire
    impacts in California.
  8: The paper evaluates the long-term mortality risk associated with exposure to
    wildfire PM2.5, compared to undifferentiated PM2.5.
  9: This study characterizes the harmful impacts of PM2.5 from wildland fire smoke
    on the health of the California population during the 11-year period of 2008 to
    2018, focusing on mortality outcomes.
  11: This paper evaluates the mortality burden and economic valuation of health burden
    from exposure to PM2.5 due to wildland fire smoke in California.
  13: The study evaluates health impacts of wildfire smoke exposure, including mortality.
Highlights:
  1: Wildfires account for a greater mortality and economic burden than indicated
    by earlier studies.
  2: The importance of wildfire management will only grow in the coming decades as
    aridification intensifies with climate change.
  4: Mortality impacts from wildland fire smoke are substantial; Elevated number of
    fires in 2008, 2017, and 2018 along with a large increase in mortality impacts;
    Mortality impacts are more widespread throughout population centers such as Los
    Angeles County, the San Joaquin Valley, and the Bay Area as smoke can be transported
    to these areas.
  5: Modeled wildland fire-only PM2.5 estimates follow anticipated spatial and temporal
    trends with respect to the patterns of fire activity in the state.
  6: The use of a wildfire-specific dose-response coefficient increases the magnitude
    of the results. Capping fire-only PM2.5 concentrations at the 99.9th percentile
    reduces attributed deaths, but impacts remain substantial.
  7: The use of fire-only PM2.5 estimates from the CMAQ model and highly resolved
    health data at the ZIP code level are identified as strengths. The application
    of a fire-specific dose-response coefficient accounting for increased toxicity
    of wildfire smoke is also a key contribution.
  8: Wildfire PM2.5 may have heightened toxicity compared to undifferentiated PM2.5.
    Studies relying solely on acute estimates from undifferentiated PM2.5 may underestimate
    the effects of wildfire PM2.5. Epidemiological findings suggest wildfire smoke
    is up to 10 times more harmful than PM from other sources, and that wildfire PM2.5
    appears to have larger effects on mortality than undifferentiated PM2.5.
  9: The study estimates a substantial mortality burden associated with wildfire PM2.5
    exposure in California, with significant economic valuation.
  13: Deep learning is used to estimate PM2.5 from wildfires.
Methodology:
  1: Used Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system wildland fire PM2.5 estimates,
    ZIP code-level mortality data, and an estimated wildfire-specific dose-response
    coefficient. The study period is from 2008 to 2018 in California.
  2: The study uses modeled wildland fire-associated PM2.5 concentrations, California
    Department of Public Health (CDPH) mortality data, and a calculated chronic dose-response
    coefficient for wildfire PM2.5 exposures and mortality to estimate premature deaths
    due to wildland fires. The analysis covers an 11-year period from 2008 to 2018
    in California.
  4: "Mortality estimated using wildfire-specific and undifferentiated chronic dose-response\
    \ values for 2008 to 2018; Modeled PM2.5 concentrations capped at the 99.9th percentile\
    \ value of all fire-only concentrations; short-term dose-response values to estimate\
    \ \u03B2 WL"
  5: Modeled wildland fire PM2.5 estimates at the 12-km grid scale for 2008 to 2018,
    estimate associated premature mortality using a chronic dose-response value for
    wildfire exposure, and calculate the associated economic valuation.
  6: The study uses a wildfire-specific dose-response value to estimate mortality
    impacts and compares it to undifferentiated PM2.5 dose-response values. It also
    uses modeled air quality estimates and analyzes the effect of capping high PM2.5
    concentrations.
  7: The study uses 11 years of CMAQ model data to estimate fire-only PM2.5 concentrations.
    A dose-response function is created that combines long-term effects from undifferentiated
    PM2.5 and acute studies of wildfire PM2.5. The analysis uses total mortality from
    all causes of death.
  8: The paper uses a CTM to separate annual wildfire PM2.5 concentrations from other
    sources. It also adjusts existing estimates of long-term exposure to undifferentiated
    PM2.5 to account for potentially different dose-response functions of wildfires.
    The paper compares estimates of mortality based on the adjusted and unadjusted
    PM2.5 concentrations.
  9: "The analysis applies CMAQ estimates of wildland fire PM2.5 to estimate mortality\
    \ outcomes using high-resolution health data over an 11-year period and applies\
    \ a chronic dose-response value for wildfire-specific PM2.5 exposure. Fire-only\
    \ PM2.5 is calculated as the difference between simulations with all emissions\
    \ and simulations with nonfire emissions only. The model simulations for 2008\
    \ to 2012 are the same as those used by Rappold et\_al. (91) and Fann et\_al.\
    \ (32)."
  11: "The analysis uses a dose-response value (\u03B2WL) and the change in PM2.5\
    \ concentration from wildland fire smoke (\u0394PM2.5ij) to calculate the mortality\
    \ burden. A Monte Carlo distribution is used to estimate the final dose-response\
    \ value. It also applies the EPA's VSL to estimate the total valuation of the\
    \ health burden."
  13: The study uses ensemble-based deep learning for estimating PM2.5 over California
    and links it with mortality data. Results are applicable to California.
More Notes:
  4: The fire-only mortality analysis was conducted from 2008-2018 in California.
    The specific locations and density of fires impacts mortality.
  6: The study analyzes 11 years of data (2008-2018).
  7: The study acknowledges limitations associated with using modeled data, including
    potential overprediction of PM2.5 during fire events. The authors address overprediction
    concerns by removing modeled data outside of the 99.9th percentile. They also
    note that the CMAQ model runs do not isolate wildfire emissions from prescribed
    burns, but anticipate prescribed burns have a minor role for the study period.
    The dose-response value was calculated using existing dose-response values because
    a long-term wildfire-specific estimate does not exist.
Quantitative material:
  1: Estimate of 52,480 to 55,710 premature deaths attributable to wildland fire PM2.5

    of $432 to $456 billion.
  4: Wildland fires responsible for ~19% of PM2.5-associated deaths overall and up
    to 42% in high-fire years; Premature deaths attributable to all sources PM2.5
    are five times larger than mortality impacts from solely wildland fire impacts.
  5: Deaths account for nearly 19% of total deaths attributable to all sources PM2.5
    in the state during this 11-year period.
