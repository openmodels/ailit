Drivers of Risk:
  2: Extreme rainfall, sea-level rise, climate change.
  5: Storm surge, rainfall events (72-hour and 10-day), atmospheric pressure, and
    wind speed.
  6: Runoff, storm surge, sea level rise, soil sealing, diminution of natural water
    storage areas.
  7: Runoff, coastal flooding, and sea-level rise contribute to increased economic
    losses.
  8: Increases in precipitation linked to climate change and changes in demographic
    factors like population growth, especially in southern and coastal regions of
    France.
Highlights:
  5: A fictive flood event in 2003 at climate 2050 would cause more than one billion
    in losses from continental flooding and 100 million from coastal flooding. The
    number of insured properties is projected to increase by 11.7% from 2015 to 2050.
  6: Major regional disparities in insured value growth are expected between 2015
    and 2050; Areas exposed to runoff are expected to extend; Sea level rise will
    significantly extend flooded areas.
  7: Significant increase in economic losses by 2050 due to climate change scenarios,
    with flooding and storm surges showing notable vulnerabilities.
  8: The greatest trend in estimated costs by 2050 is due to changes in vulnerability
    rather than climatic variation alone; coastal flood damages could rise from 7%
    to 14% of total damages.
Methodology:
  2: Combines climate projections from the ARPEGE-Climate model with CCR's hazard
    and damage models to simulate insured losses from flood and storm surge. Applicable
    to France, focusing on simulating conditions for 2000 (current climate) and 2050
    (future climate).
  5: Flood was modelled at two different catchment scales (small watershed and large
    watershed). Coastal floods were detected using thresholds for tide, atmospheric
    pressure, and wind speed, calibrated with historical events. Future insured property
    values are estimated using INSEE projections.
  6: Probabilistic hazard maps are built by compiling hazard maps for each event.
    The analysis extrapolates from CCR historical insurance database over the past
    10 years.
  8: Simulated insured losses under current and future conditions using the RCP 4.5
    scenario, with further assessments planned under RCP 6.0 and 400 years of climatic
    simulations.
More Notes:
  5: The analysis includes vulnerability assessment based on INSEE projections for
    population growth and territorial dynamics, indicating an increase in the number
    of properties at risk by 2050.
  6: The model ignores prevention and protection measures that may take place between
    now and 2050; Erosion and accretion are not considered.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Insured losses due to climatic disasters (flood, droughts, cyclonic winds, windstorm,
    hail, snowfall).
  5: Economic losses due to flooding, specifically for continental and coastal flooding.
  6: Insured values, areas exposed to flooding.
  7: Potential economic costs are indicated through insurance losses projected from
    flooding, storm surges, and multiple hazards by 2050.
Quantitative material:
  2: The study simulates 200 fictive years corresponding to actual and 2050 climatic
    conditions to estimate insured losses.
  5: More than one billion for continental flooding losses; 100 million for coastal
    flooding losses for a fictive event in 2003 at climate 2050.
  6: Insured values would grow by 72% between 2015 and 2050; 20 cm increase in sea
    level leads to significant extension of flooded areas.
  7: Box plots provide quantitative data on projected insurance losses due to flooding,
    storm surges, and multiple hazards from actual to future scenarios, with specific
    figures given for expected medians in million euros.
  8: A 20% increase in damages due to higher precipitation levels; the annual amount
    of damages from flood and storm surge is projected to rise from 855 to 1325 million
    euros (~+55%).
