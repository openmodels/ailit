Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme heat intensity, measured by the temperature of the hottest several days
    in each year (Tx5d).
  2: Extreme heat intensity, annual average temperature, and temperature variability.
  3: Annual mean temperature, extreme heat (Tx5d - intensity of the hottest 5-day
    period), daily-scale temperature variability, drought
  4: Anthropogenic extreme heat and its effects on economic growth, particularly the
    frequency and intensity of heat events, serve as key drivers of risk.
  5: Anthropogenic changes in extreme heat (specifically Tx5d, which is not fully
    defined on this page but seems to be a measure of heat intensity and duration).
  6: Anthropogenic changes in the intensity of extreme heat, specifically related
    to the hottest five days of the year, are the primary drivers of risk impacting
    economic outcomes.
  7: Increased extreme heat intensity (specifically Tx5d, the temperature of the hottest
    5-day heat wave in each year); Anthropogenic climate change; Average temperatures;
    Temperature variability
  8: Extreme heat, annual mean temperature, temperature variability, annual cycle,
    accumulated precipitation.
  10: Anthropogenic changes in the number of days exceeding the 95th percentile of
    daily maximum temperature (Tx5d) are used as a driver of economic changes.
  12: Historical climate damages.
  13: The driver of risk is extreme heat.

Highlights:
  1: Human-caused increases in heat waves have depressed economic output most in the
    poor tropical regions. Global inequality is both a cause and consequence of the
    unequal burden of climate change.
  2: Extreme heat significantly decreases economic growth in warm regions, weakly
    affects growth in temperate regions, and increases growth in cold regions. Tropical,
    low-income regions are most vulnerable and suffer the most from increased extreme
    temperatures.
  3: Significant independent effects of both average and extreme temperatures on economic
    growth; Extreme heat causes large damages in low-latitude regions and transitions
    to modest damages and lastly benefits as latitude increases; Temperature variability
    has a strong negative effect on growth; The interaction between mean temperature
    and Tx5d is significant, implying that increases in mean temperatures are harmful
    in warmer locations due to interactions with increased extreme heat intensity.
  4: Extreme heat has a stronger economic effect in the tropics, and while regions
    can return to previous income trajectories after heat waves, repeated events may
    cause long-term income changes.
  5: Anthropogenic changes to extreme heat have primarily harmed tropical regions,
    with GDPpc losses exceeding 5% per year in some countries. Regions with lower
    income per capita experience greater relative damages, while wealthier regions
    may experience limited damages or even benefits. Cumulative global losses due
    to extreme heat are substantial (>$16 trillion in 2013).
  6: Poorer regions with higher baseline temperatures suffer the most from increases
    in extreme heat, and rich countries that experience limited damages are primarily
    responsible for fossil fuel CO2 emissions leading to these extreme conditions.
  7: Increased extreme heat intensity significantly decreases economic growth in relatively
    warm tropical regions and weakly affects it in relatively cool midlatitude regions.
    Anthropogenic climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of these
    economically consequential heat extremes, and the effects of climate change on
    extreme heat have amplified underlying inequality, disproportionately harming
    low-income, low-emitting regions.
  8: Warming has already increased the frequency and intensity of heat extremes, demonstrating
    the economic costs of these events and their unequal global distribution.
  9: Regions with larger annual cycles of temperature may be less harmed by temperature
    variability. The effect of temperature extremes is independent of other parts
    of the temperature distribution (e.g., variability). The results show even stronger
    effects for Tx5d when region-specific linear trends in growth are added, indicating
    the main results are conservative.
  10: The paper creates a global sample of continuous GDPpc data at the regional level
    with parametric and residual uncertainty.
  12: National attribution of historical climate damages.
  13: The study finds a globally unequal effect of extreme heat on economic growth.
Methodology:
  1: Uses subnational economic data, extreme heat metrics, and an ensemble of climate
    models to quantify the effect of extreme heat intensity on economic growth globally.
    Applicable to the period 1992-2013.
  2: The empirical model includes extreme heat intensity (Tx5d), annual average temperature,
    their interaction, and temperature variability. Historical climate model simulations
    are used to assess the economic effects of anthropogenic changes in extreme heat
    intensity.
  3: Fixed effects model used to purge time-invariant regional characteristics; likelihood
    ratio test used to compare models with and without Tx5d.
  4: Analysis utilizes historical and climate model experiments from CMIP6, applying
    a distributed lag model to estimate economic impacts and recovery from extreme
    heat.
  5: "The study calculates the change in economic growth in subnational regions due\
    \ to anthropogenic changes in Tx5d over 1992\u20132013.  It uses a statistical\
    \ model to downscale country-level GDPpc to regional GDPpc using country-level\
    \ GDPpc and regional nighttime luminosity.  A Monte Carlo analysis is performed\
    \ to quantify uncertainty, resampling from the econometric model, climate models,\
    \ and statistical model used to predict regional GDPpc. Counterfactual regional\
    \ GDPpc is generated to represent GDP in the absence of anthropogenic extreme\
    \ heat."
  7: Econometric analysis using subnational data to measure the effect of extreme
    heat. The key assumption underlying their extrapolation procedure is that the
    underlying average temperature controls the marginal effect of extreme heat globally.
  8: Empirical regression methods at the subnational level, climate model simulations
    to calculate counterfactual extreme heat time series, Monte Carlo approach to
    propagate uncertainty, bootstrapping to estimate sampling uncertainty.
  9: The paper uses panel regression with fixed effects to model economic growth.
    They interact Tx5d with annual average temperature to incorporate heterogeneity
    in regional responses to extreme heat. They also use a bootstrap resampling procedure
    to estimate sampling uncertainty. The analysis is based on data from 1979-2016.
  10: A statistical model (Eq. 2) is developed to predict regional GDPpc using country-level
    GDPpc and regional nightlights. The model is trained on data from 1992-2013. A
    10-fold cross-validation is performed to test the out-of-sample predictive power
    of the model. Monte Carlo analysis is used to propagate uncertainty.
  12: Analysis of ERA5 reanalysis data, CMIP6 climate model data, GADM shapefile data,
    and Palmer Drought Severity Index data.
More Notes:
  2: The analysis extrapolates results to regions without economic data based on their
    average temperatures, which is a key limitation. Results are robust to more restrictive
    standard error clustering and region-specific growth trends.
  3: The paper argues that average temperatures are insufficient to capture the effect
    of extremes due to non-Gaussian temperature distributions and long tails; The
    value of incorporating Tx5d relative to a model that only includes annual average
    temperature is supported by a likelihood ratio test (P < 0.0001); The study finds
    that people are poorly adapted to extreme heat in the present day, even in regions
    inured to being warm.
  5: The paper acknowledges a data gap in subnational GDPpc, particularly in Africa
    and Southeast Asia, and addresses this with a statistical model.  The metric Tx5d
    is key to the analysis but is not defined on this page.  The study emphasizes
    the inequality of climate impacts, with poorer regions suffering greater relative
    losses.
  7: "The study focuses on extreme heat intensity as opposed to extreme heat frequency\
    \ or duration. There are data limitations in the world\u2019s hottest and lowest\
    \ income regions. The authors acknowledge the conservative nature of their results.\
    \ The authors found the effects of average temperatures appear to persist, rather\
    \ than being recovered similar to the effects of extreme heat. Damages from anthropogenic\
    \ changes in variability are spatially complex and smaller than the damages from\
    \ extreme or average temperatures."
  8: Uses nighttime luminosity data to infer local economic production. Focuses on
    extreme heat rather than annual mean temperatures.
  9: The paper acknowledges that averaging Tx5d values across regions may average
    values from different parts of the year. They conduct a supplementary analysis
    where they recalculate extreme heat as deviations from location- and month-specific
    indices. They also examine whether the effects of extreme temperatures persist
    over time using a distributed lag version of the regression equation.
  10: The paper acknowledges that Uzbekistan and Kenya appear to be outliers in the
    GDPpc data. The data is available at a specified github repository.

Quantitative material:
  1: "Cumulative 1992\u20132013 losses from anthropogenic extreme heat likely fall\
    \ between $5 trillion and $29.3 trillion globally. Losses amount to 6.7% of Gross\
    \ Domestic Product per capita per year for regions in the bottom income decile,\
    \ but only 1.5% for regions in the top income decile."
  2: "In Brazil (23.8\xB0C average), a 1 SD increase in extreme heat intensity depresses\
    \ growth by 0.63 percentage points. In Norway (4\xB0C average), a 1 SD increase\
    \ in extreme heat intensity enhances growth by 0.62 percentage points."
  3: "Annual average temperatures explain ~40% of the variation in raw Tx5d values;\
    \ annual average temperature anomalies explain less than 13% of the variation\
    \ in Tx5d anomalies; Temperature variability effect on growth: \u22122.01 p.p.\
    \ per SD (with Tx5d), \u22122.21 p.p. per SD (without Tx5d)."
  4: "Regional Tx5d values average 0.77\xB0C more globally due to anthropogenic warming\
    \ over 1992\u20132013, with increases of more than 1\xB0C in the tropics."
  5: Cumulative global losses due to extreme heat average more than $16 trillion in
    2013.  Uncertainty analysis indicates cumulative global effects likely fall between
    losses of $29.3 trillion and $5 trillion. Regions in the lowest income decile
    have experienced losses of 6.7% of GDPpc per year, compared to 1.5% in the top
    income decile. GDPpc is >5% per year lower in tropical countries like Brazil,
    Venezuela, and Mali, and ~1% per year lower in high-latitude nations like Canada
    and Finland, due to anthropogenic effects on extreme heat.
  6: The paper quantifies average annual changes in regional GDP per capita and cumulative
    global GDP changes due to anthropogenic extreme heat from 1992 to 2013.
  7: Extreme heat intensity accounts for almost 10% of the overall damages despite
    being based on <2% of days in the year.
  8: Data from 1368 regions, each with between 4 and 38 years of data, for a total
    of 26,918 observations. 80 climate model simulations.
  9: "The paper presents a model for growth g in region i and year t that involves\
    \ coefficients alpha, beta, and gamma, and a regression equation (Eq. 1) with\
    \ Tx5d and its interaction with annual average temperature. It also mentions calculating\
    \ regional growth changes due to anthropogenic changes to extreme heat, denoted\
    \ as \uF044g."
  10: The paper reports that country-level GDPpc explains 87% of the variation in
    regional GDPpc. Out-of-sample prediction errors for models including country-level
    GDPpc are less than 7% of average regional log GDPpc. Models with only country-level
    GDPpc and regional nightlights have the smallest out-of-sample prediction error.
    Predicted data explains ~87% of variation in the observed data with outliers included,
    and ~90% when outliers are dropped. A Monte Carlo analysis with N = 10,000 iterations
    is used to quantify uncertainty in damages.
