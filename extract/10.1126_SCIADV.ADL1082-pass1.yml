Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased extreme heat (heat waves) from anthropogenic global warming
  2: The intensity of the most extreme heat wave in each year impacts economic growth.
  3: Extreme heat and temperature variability are primary drivers impacting economic
    growth.
  4: Anthropogenic increases in extreme heat events (intensity and frequency); changes
    in average temperatures.
  5: Anthropogenic changes to extreme heat, particularly impacting GDPpc in regions.
  6: Anthropogenic changes in Tx5d intensity (extreme heat); Increases in average
    temperatures; Increased global economic inequality; Fossil fuel CO2 emissions.
  7: Increased frequency and intensity of extreme heat due to anthropogenic climate
    change.
  8: Increased frequency and intensity of heat extremes driven by anthropogenic climate
    change.
  9: Extreme high temperatures (Tx5d), Temperature variability (V), Annual mean temperature
    (T)
  10: Anthropogenic changes in extreme temperatures (Tx5d).
  13: Extreme heat
Highlights:
  1: Human-caused increases in heat waves have depressed economic output most in the
    poor tropical regions least culpable for warming. Global inequality is both a
    cause and consequence of the unequal burden of climate change.
  2: Tropical regions lose income with increased extreme heat; high-latitude regions
    gain economically as their baseline temperatures are too cold for optimal growth.
  3: Extreme heat and temperature variability negatively impact growth, especially
    in warm regions; adaptations have not eliminated heat's negative effects.
  4: Anthropogenic warming has increased the frequency and intensity of extreme heat
    events globally, especially in the tropics; tropical regions are particularly
    vulnerable to losses from human-caused heat extremes; the effect of extreme heat
    can persist for an additional year and then fade.
  5: High-income countries like the United States experience significant absolute
    economic losses due to extreme heat but relatively less in terms of GDPpc.
  6: Poorer regions suffer most from extreme heat increases; Rich countries are primarily
    responsible for increases in global temperatures and associated heat extremes;
    High-emitting nations can be considered directly responsible for a large fraction
    of warming-induced heat extremes and the income losses suffered by individual
    regions; Anthropogenic increases in average temperatures make extreme heat become
    damaging even where it originally appeared beneficial.
  7: Climate change amplifies inequality, disproportionately harming low-income, low-emitting
    regions due to extreme heat.
  8: Demonstrates the significant economic costs and unequal global distribution of
    heat extremes, increasing the urgency for climate mitigation and adaptation investments.
  9: Extreme temperatures have impacts on economic growth; effects of Tx5d are stronger
    when region-specific linear trends in growth are added.
  10: The analysis produces a global sample of continuous GDPpc data at the regional
    level with an explicit treatment of parametric and residual uncertainty.
  13: Globally unequal effect of extreme heat on economic growth
Methodology:
  1: Uses subnational economic data, extreme heat metrics measuring the temperature
    of the hottest several days in each year, and an ensemble of climate models to
    quantify the effect of extreme heat intensity on economic growth globally.
  2: Empirical model includes effects of Tx5d and annual average temperature, allowing
    different responses based on regional temperatures; results are combined with
    historical climate simulations.
  3: Uses a fixed effects model to assess the independent effects of average and extreme
    temperatures on growth by interacting Tx5d with temperature metrics and including
    additional variables like income and drought index.
  4: Empirical model using a distributed lag version to track the persistence of heat
    wave impacts; historical and natural climate model experiments from CMIP6; statistical
    model to infer regional GDPpc time series; autoregressive distributed lag model
    used to test robustness.
  5: The analysis uses climate model simulations to generate counterfactual regional
    GDPpc, combined with a Monte Carlo analysis to quantify uncertainty.
  6: Uses Monte Carlo simulations to quantify uncertainty; Assesses damages from changes
    in average temperatures and variability compared to changes in extremes.
  7: The analysis uses the temperature of the hottest 5-day heat wave (Tx5d) as a
    metric for extreme heat intensity.
  8: Analysis involves using empirical regression methods at the subnational level,
    simulations with climate models, projection of regional economic growth changes,
    and Monte Carlo sampling to estimate uncertainty.
  9: Panel regression with fixed effects, Bootstrap resampling procedure, Distributed
    lag version of the regression equation; coefficients from distributed lag regression
    applied to observed and counterfactual Tx5d time series.
  10: A statistical model predicts log regional GDPpc using country-level GDPpc and
    regional average nighttime luminosity (nightlights) from 1992-2013. The model
    incorporates an interaction term between country-level GDPpc and nightlights.
    Out-of-sample predictive power is tested with a 10-fold cross-validation analysis.
    Uncertainty is calculated using a Monte Carlo analysis (N = 10,000) to incorporate
    and propagate uncertainty at each step.
More Notes:
  1: The paper aims to quantify the global macroeconomic effects of extreme heat and
    identify risks associated with intensifying heat waves.
  2: Extrapolation to regions without economic data indicates latitudinal structure
    of the effect of extreme heat, emphasizing income losses in warm tropical regions.
  3: Increases in mean temperatures become harmful in warmer regions, particularly
    due to interactions between higher mean temperatures and increased extreme heat
    intensity.
  4: The study considers whether regions recover from extreme heat and how long recovery
    takes, distinguishing between level effects and growth effects; repeated extreme
    heat events might generate tangible long-term income changes even if individual
    events do not permanently affect economic growth.
  5: Uncertainty in the total global effect of extreme heat exists, but individual
    regions often show low uncertainty regarding economic impacts.
  6: The spatial pattern of damages from extreme heat is different from the original
    pattern of the marginal effect of extremes; Historical changes in average temperatures
    have caused uniform losses globally, with greater magnitudes than the losses from
    extreme heat.
  7: The paper focuses on extreme heat intensity rather than frequency or duration,
    which could lead to conservative estimates of economic damage.
  9: The study aims to isolate the causal effect of heat intensity on the hottest
    days of the year on economic growth. Includes adjustments to isolate anthropogenic
    warming contributions to extreme temperatures.
  10: The model is used to calculate counterfactual GDPpc to estimate the effect of
    anthropogenic changes in extreme temperatures on GDPpc growth. The authors emphasize
    they do not apply their empirical regression approach to constructed data, but
    only use it in the calculation of accumulated economic damages from warming.

Quantitative Material:
  5: Regions in the lowest income decile have experienced losses of 6.7% of GDPpc
    per year.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Cumulative 1992\u20132013 losses from anthropogenic extreme heat likely fall\
    \ between $5 trillion and $29.3 trillion globally. Losses amount to 6.7% of Gross\
    \ Domestic Product per capita per year for regions in the bottom income decile,\
    \ but only 1.5% for regions in the top income decile."
  2: In Brazil, a standard deviation increase in Tx5d intensity depresses growth by
    0.63 percentage points.
  3: Temperature variability negatively affects growth by -2.01 percentage points
    per standard deviation, increasing to -2.21 when excluding extreme heat (Tx5d)
    terms.
  4: "Regional Tx5d values average 0.77\xB0C more than they would have without warming\
    \ over 1992\u20132013; probability of extreme Tx5d values increased by 13 percentage\
    \ points across regions on average."
  6: Fig. 4 presents quantitative visualizations (maps, graphs, and scatter plots)
    of the relationships described above, including percentage change in GDP, GDP
    change in 2010 USD, cumulative global GDP change, and a scatter plot relating
    GDP loss to CO2 emissions.
  7: Changes in extreme heat intensity account for almost 10% of the overall damages
    despite being based on <2% of days in the year.
  9: "Panel regression model: git = \uF0611 Tit + \uF0612 T2it + \uF0621 Txit + \uF062\
    2 Txit * Tit + \uF0671 Vit + \uF0672 Vit * Ai + \uF070 Pit + \uF06Di + \uF064\
    t + \u03F5it"
  10: Country GDPpc alone explains some 87% of variation in regional GDPpc in the
    sample. Models that include country-level GDPpc have high out-of-sample predictive
    power, with prediction errors of less than 7% of the average regional log GDPpc.
