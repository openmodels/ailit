  12: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change increased extreme monsoon rainfall, flooding highly vulnerable
    communities in Pakistan
  3: Extreme monsoon rainfall increased by climate change; proximity of settlements/infrastructure/agriculture
    to floodplains; inadequate infrastructure; limited ex-ante risk reduction capacity;
    outdated river management system; high poverty rates and socioeconomic factors.
  4: Record-breaking monsoon rainfall, high population density, high rates of poverty,
    climate-related hazards, changes in likelihood and intensity of extreme weather
    events, increasing trend in extreme rainfall in South Asia, increasing strength
    and westward movement of the monsoon over Pakistan.
  6: "La Ni\xF1a, negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and heat lows over Pakistan\
    \ are identified as drivers of excessive precipitation and flooding in the Indus\
    \ basin."
  9: "Annual maximum of the mean 60-day precipitation during June\u2013September,\
    \ over the Indus river basin; Annual maximum of the mean 5-day precipitation in\
    \ June\u2013September over the Sindh and Balochistan provinces together"
  11: Increased global mean surface temperature (GMST) leading to changes in extreme
    precipitation events (60-day max average rainfall).
  12: Anthropogenic climate change impacting precipitation patterns (PPP - presumed
    precipitation metric) in the southern provinces of Balochistan and Sindh.
  13: Increased intensity and likelihood of extreme rainfall events (60-day and 5-day)
    due to a warmer climate.
  14: Increased heavy rainfall events; flooding.
  15: Floods along the River Indus, high-intensity rainfall, drainage 'failures',
    sedimentation of watercourse channels, reliance on river engineering paradigm
    and hydrological megaprojects for flood management, breaching of levees and intentionally
    spilling flood water.
  18: Extreme peaks in rainfall over Pakistan in light of human-caused climate change;
    proximity of human settlements, infrastructure, and agricultural land to floodplains;
    limited ex-ante risk reduction capacity; an outdated river management system;
    underlying vulnerabilities driven by poverty, socioeconomic factors that disadvantage
    women, and ongoing political and economic instability.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change increased extreme monsoon rainfall, flooding highly vulnerable
    communities in Pakistan
  3: Climate change has increased extreme monsoon rainfall, leading to devastating
    flooding in Pakistan. There is a discrepancy between model simulations and observations,
    making it infeasible to fully quantify the overall role of human-induced climate
    change. However, the majority of models and observations show that intense rainfall
    has become heavier as Pakistan has warmed.
  6: "The concurrence of La Ni\xF1a and a negative IOD in 2022 provided additional\
    \ moisture to feed monsoon depressions, potentially contributing to flooding in\
    \ the Indus basin."
  9: The study analyses the Indus basin and the combined provinces of Sindh and Balochistan
    for extreme rainfall events.
  11: The analysis focuses on quantifying the probability and intensity of extreme
    rainfall events in the Indus River basin and how these change with increasing
    GMST. The 2022 event is specifically analyzed.
  12: Few models pass the evaluation tests. Remaining models and observational products
    show differing results with large uncertainties, precluding a robust quantification
    of the role of anthropogenic climate change through synthesis. The observations
    and models are used separately to inform the overarching conclusion.
  13: Models generally show an increase in both the likelihood and intensity of extreme
    rainfall events with a warmer climate. However, discrepancies exist between the
    models.
  14: "Heavy rainfall events are projected to increase in intensity and probability\
    \ in the Indus River basin, Balochistan, and Sindh regions with a 0.8\xB0C warmer\
    \ climate."
  18: Climate change indeed increased the rainfall intensity up to 50% as the best
    estimate in some models (for 5-day rainfall extreme). There is an urgent need
    to reduce vulnerability to extreme weather in Pakistan.
Methodology:
  1: Attribution study focusing on the role of climate change in the 2022 Pakistan
    floods.
  3: Probabilistic event attribution methodology and detailed assessment of the dynamics
    to understand the role of climate change in the extreme rainfall and flooding
    event. Evaluation of climate models, comparing simulated rainfall characteristics
    with observations. Focus on the summer 2022 monsoon season in Pakistan.
  6: The study correlates July and August precipitation in the CPC dataset with NCDC
    v5 ERSST SST values over the Indus basin. Anomalies in mean sea level pressure
    and 2m-temperature in May are analyzed for 2010 and 2022.
  9: Analysis of time series of daily precipitation values from the Indus basin and
    Sindh/Balochistan provinces; Trend calculation from observations; Model validation;
    Multi-method multi-model attribution; Synthesis of the attribution statement;
    Use of a generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution that scales with global
    mean surface temperature (GMST)
  11: "The study uses Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) analysis to model extreme precipitation\
    \ events in the Indus River basin based on gridded datasets (CPC, ERA5, IMERG).\
    \ It fits the GEV distribution with location parameters scaling proportionally\
    \ to GMST. The analysis includes a comparison of current climate (2022) with cooler\
    \ climates (1.2\xB0C cooler, and scenarios with 2\xB0C warming compared to 1.2\xB0\
    C). Bootstrap methods are used to assess uncertainty. The results are applicable\
    \ to understanding changes in extreme rainfall risk in the Indus River basin under\
    \ different warming scenarios."
  12: The study analyzes climate data from CPC, ERA5, and IMERG datasets. Models are
    validated, and those that pass are used in a synthesis analysis with observational
    data. A weighted average and an unweighted average of models and observations
    are calculated if the data sources are compatible. Return period analysis is performed
    using GEVA values.
  13: "Comparison of climate models simulating rainfall events under different climate\
    \ scenarios (1.2\xB0C cooler and 0.8\xB0C warmer). Analysis of intensity change\
    \ and probability ratios. Uses boxplots to display model results."
  14: "Compares 100-year heavy rainfall events under current conditions with those\
    \ in a 0.8\xB0C warmer climate using multiple climate models."
  18: Analysis of observed trends in rainfall, climate models with and without human-induced
    greenhouse gas increases, and statistical methods to determine the role of human-induced
    climate change.
More Notes:
  1: This paper is an attribution study focused on the climate science of the Pakistan
    floods. It does not appear to include macroeconomic or fiscal analysis, cost-benefit
    analysis, or quantitative data on economic impacts. The focus is on attributing
    the role of climate change to the event.
  4: Pakistan is one of the countries that are most at risk of climate extremes. The
    country has a largely arid desert climate and frequently experiences severe heatwaves.
  6: The study focuses on meteorological factors contributing to flooding, but doesn't
    explicitly quantify the economic impacts. The figures and analysis are specific
    to the 2010 and 2022 flooding events in the Indus basin.
  9: The study uses gridded data from CPC, ERA5, and IMERG datasets for analysis.
  12: The analysis focuses on the southern provinces of Balochistan and Sindh. The
    definition of PPP is not explicitly stated but is presumed to be a precipitation
    metric. The study acknowledges common model uncertainties may be larger than the
    model spread. There is a lack of structural diversity among the remaining models
    after validation.
  13: The regions of interest are the Indus river basin and Balochistan/Sindh. The
    models project statistically significant changes for short duration rainfall events.
  14: Notes that projected changes are on average smaller than those in published
    literature for the region, which encompasses a larger area with less natural variability,
    which makes reliable quantitative projections difficult.
  18: The paper acknowledges the role of non-climatic factors in driving the devastating
    impacts of the floods in Pakistan, and suggests that disaster management policies
    and plans may have played a role in reducing the impacts.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  3: Devastating impacts on human settlements, infrastructure (homes, buildings, bridges),
    and agricultural land due to flooding; underlying vulnerabilities driven by high
    poverty rates and socioeconomic factors (e.g., gender, age, income).
  4: Damages likely exceed preliminary estimates of around US$30 billion with further
    economic disruption certain in the months to come. Loss of food crops totals around
    US$2.3 billion.
  6: The study implicitly connects the meteorological drivers to flooding events,
    which are likely to have macroeconomic and fiscal impacts, but these are not directly
    quantified on this page.

  3: Some models suggest climate change could have increased rainfall intensity up
    to 50%.
  4: Record rainfall that fell between 1st and 31st August over Sindh and Balochistan
    was 726% and 590% of the usual totals for August (since 1961) in the respective
    regions. Pakistan as a whole received 243% more rainfall than usual during this
    period. The flooding affected over 33 million people, destroyed 1.7 million homes,
    and nearly 1500 people died. Around 6700 kilometres of road, 269 bridges and 1460
    health facilities were destroyed, 18590 schools were damaged, 750000 livestock
    were killed and around 18000 square kilometres of cropland were ruined, including
    roughly 45% of the cotton crop.
  6: "The study quantifies La Ni\xF1a intensity using the Nino 3.4 index and IOD using\
    \ the IOD index, and correlates precipitation with sea surface temperatures. The\
    \ indices range from -1.5 to 1.5 for Nino 3.4 SST, and -0.8 to 0.8 for the IOD.\
    \ These values are compared between 2010 and 2022."
  9: "Return periods, probability ratio (PR; the factor-change in the event\u2019\
    s probability) and change in intensity of the event"
  11: "The page presents figures showing the relationship between GMST and rainfall,\
    \ as well as return periods for extreme rainfall events under different climate\
    \ scenarios (2022 climate and a climate 1.2\xB0C cooler). While specific GDP or\
    \ fiscal impacts aren't mentioned, the analysis quantifies changes in precipitation\
    \ intensity and probability."
  12: "The figures show PPP (mm/day) correlated with Global Mean Surface Temperature\
    \ (GMST) (\xB0C), and PPP anomaly (mm/day) correlated with return period (years).\
    \ GEVA values and confidence intervals are provided for return period analysis."
  13: Intensity of rainfall events may increase by up to 30% for the large region
    and up to 50% for the small region. Intensities increasing by 13% for the short-duration
    event.
  14: "The 100-year 60-day heavy rainfall event over the Indus river basin has an\
    \ intensity change by 10% and the probability ratio rises by 30% with a 0.8\xB0\
    C warmer climate (2\xB0C since pre-industrial); the 100-year 5-day heavy rainfall\
    \ event over the region encompassing Balochistan and Sindh has an intensity change\
    \ by 10% and the probability ratio rises by 40% with a 0.8\xB0C warmer climate\
    \ (2\xB0C since pre-industrial)."
  15: Agriculture accounts for 26% of Pakistan's GDP. 39% of the country's labor force
    is engaged in agriculture.
  18: Intense rainfall has become heavier as the world has warmed, that climate change
    indeed increased the rainfall intensity up to 50% as the best estimate in some
    models (for 5-day rainfall extreme).
