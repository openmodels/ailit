Drivers of Risk:
  4: Monsoon-driven flooding, river bank erosion, storm surges, and salinization in
    coastal regions are significant challenges affecting Bangladesh.
Highlights:
  4: The effectiveness of small-scale flood-proofing measures emphasized by the National
    Water Management Plan, which was more successful compared to large-scale plans
    like the FAP.
More Notes:
  4: Measures related to cyclonic storm surge flooding, such as early warning and
    shelter programs, significantly reduced fatalities during disasters, demonstrating
    adaptation benefits.
No relevant information:
  3: This page primarily discusses adaptation strategies in flood risk management,
    focusing on the shift from 'predict and control' to 'flexible and adaptive' regimes,
    and the adoption of Adaptive Management (AM) principles. It mentions the Bangladesh
    Delta Plan 2100 (BDP2100) and its alignment with Sustainable Development Goals,
    but does not provide specific quantitative information on macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes, costs, or benefits of adaptation at a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  4: The Flood Action Plan (FAP) aimed to embank major rivers in Bangladesh; however,
    it was doubtful if economic returns from protecting agricultural lands would outweigh
    the estimated costs.
Quantitative material:
  4: The initially estimated cost for the FAP was USD 155 billion.
