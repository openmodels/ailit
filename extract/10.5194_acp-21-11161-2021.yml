Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increase in surface temperatures, leading to enhanced instability and stronger
    moisture transport; Total column water vapor (TCWV), convective available potential
    energy (CAPE), and aerosol optical depth (AOD)
  12: Increasing trends of CAPE (Convective Available Potential Energy) and TCWV (Total
    Column Water Vapor), and declining trends of AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) influence
    lightning occurrences and intensity, which can lead to economic disruptions.
Highlights:
  1: Lightning frequency and intensity are projected to increase significantly across
    India by the end of the century, with the highest risk along the coasts, requiring
    immediate attention from policymakers.
  12: Lightning frequency is projected to increase significantly, especially under
    the RCP8.5 scenario, with extreme radiances showing a much higher increase. The
    strongest increases in lightning frequency are mainly observed in the Coasts,
    BoB, PI, IGP and WCI regions
Methodology:
  1: "Analysis of long-term (1998\u20132014) Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)\
    \ satellite-based lightning observations; statistical dominance analysis; multiple\
    \ global circulation models (GCMs) used to understand the long-term impact of\
    \ urbanization on lightning (1950-2100); multilinear regression equations"
  12: The study uses multi-model India-wide average projections of climate parameters
    under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios to project lightning occurrences and intensity
    from 1950 to 2100. The trends are analyzed both zonally and for India as a whole,
    and bias corrections are applied.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on lightning strikes in India, providing information on their
    causes, trends, and future projections.  The authors suggest their findings require
    immediate attention from policymakers.
  12: The impact of AOD on lightning occurrences appears to be complex, sometimes
    compensating for the effect of increasing CAPE and TCWV. The time horizon for
    the results is up to 2100.
