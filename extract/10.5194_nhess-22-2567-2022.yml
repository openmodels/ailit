Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (including sea-level rise), human factors (large population, rapid
    socio-economic growth, subsidence from excessive groundwater extraction), and
    natural factors contributing to flood risk.
  2: Assets exposed to flood hazards are growing through rapid land-use change, urbanisation,
    and economic expansion.
  4: Flooding from sewers, groundwater, and non-main rivers.
  5: Flooding (fluvial, pluvial, coastal, compound), tropical cyclones, extreme precipitation,
    storm surges.
  6: Demand for development land and climate change are likely to increase flood risk,
    especially in coastal areas.
  7: "The 1993 Mississippi River flood, which led to the river flooding over 1200km\
    \ of the river\u2019s length and about 840000km2 in area, resulting in over USD15\
    \ billion in economic damage."
  8: Flooding is identified as a key driver of risk, with mentions of hurricanes,
    torrential rains, snowmelt, tsunamis, sprawling development, loss of wetland storage,
    expansion of impermeable surfaces, and lack of investment in flood defence infrastructure.
    Climate change is also noted as a factor increasing the frequency of intensive
    rainfall events in Japan.
  9: Floods, particularly in water-prone areas like wetlands and urbanized floodplains,
    and intensive rainstorms enhancing urban floods.
  10: Floods are a risk driver, with future climate projections considered in flood
    risk management strategies.
  12: Rising flood hazards from climate change (i.e. more frequent storms, intensive
    rainfall, etc.)
  13: Rapid urbanization and land-use changes transforming green spaces into urban
    areas in cities near coasts such as Bangkok, Jakarta, and Ho Chi Minh City, leading
    to increased urban runoff that drainage and flood measures were unable to cope
    with.
  14: Urban floods enhanced by urbanization and rapid development, typhoons, increased
    population density, climate change raising sea levels and making storm surges
    more hazardous.
  15: Frequency, intensity, and magnitude of storms (typhoons), intense rainfall events,
    and sea surges are increasing flood hazard.

    losses and impacts on properties and people.

Highlights:
  1: Highlights the importance of integrating social, ecological, and economic themes
    into flood risk management (FRM) practices and the need for "mixed options" to
    move towards long-term sustainability in FRM.
  4: UK flood policy seeks to integrate Flood Risk Management (FRM) with land-use
    planning, considering future development and flood risk, which addresses social,
    economic, and environmental criteria.
  5: The US regularly experiences severe flooding with significant mortality and economic
    losses. Tropical cyclones are a major driver of flood risk.
  6: Executive Order 11988 Floodplain Management directed federal agencies to consider
    flood risks in their actions.
  7: The 1993 Mississippi River flood highlighted the need to review flood management
    approaches, moving beyond hard-engineering solutions to a more integrated ecosystem-based
    approach with risk-based forecasting.
  8: The U.S. has a mixed-options approach to flood risk management but faces challenges
    with inadequate preparation in some cities (e.g., Houston). Japan faces frequent
    flood hazards due to its topography and increasing rainfall intensity attributed
    to climate change.
  9: Japanese flood risk management integrates hard and soft measures, acknowledges
    unavoidable flooding, and emphasizes public engagement and awareness. Enhanced
    flood resilience measures post-tsunami and urban flooding laws were also implemented.
  10: Japan employs relocation and setback strategies, and fluvial flood prediction
    incorporating future climate projections to manage flood risk.
  12: All four countries show a positive trend towards integrating sustainability
    into flood management practices in the post-2000s.
  13: Flood management practices in Asian cities have evolved from flood control and
    defense measures to flood risk management and sustainable flood risk management,
    adapting to rapid urbanization and climate change challenges.
  14: Coastal cities in Asia have transitioned from primarily relying on engineering
    solutions for flood management to incorporating socio-economic considerations,
    early warning systems, and climate change adaptation strategies. Governments have
    implemented flood risk zoning policies, restricted developments in high-risk areas,
    and established integrated flood management strategies.
  15: Traditional hard-engineering flood defenses in Asian coastal megacities are
    becoming financially unsustainable given increasing flood risk.
Methodology:
  1: Review of past and current flood management experiences from flood defence to
    sustainable flood risk management (SFRM) in four developed countries.
  4: Surface Water Management Plans (SWMPs) outline a preferred surface water management
    strategy. The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) aims to restrict inappropriate
    development in areas at risk of flooding, directing development away from areas
    at highest risk and toward where development is necessary, making it safe without
    increasing flood risk elsewhere. This requires a strategic flood risk assessment
    by local planning authorities.
  7: Comparison of satellite images from 1991 (normal conditions) and 1993 (flood
    conditions) to illustrate the extent of the flooding.
  9: The page discusses the legislative and policy framework, such as the River Law
    and its amendments, as well as the integration of social and environmental issues
    into flood risk management.
  10: The paper compares sustainable flood risk management (SFRM) across four countries.
    Japan's approach includes relocation, setback strategies, and fluvial flood prediction
    with future climate projection.
  12: Review of flood management policy evolution across four countries (UK, Netherlands,
    USA, and Japan) spanning from pre-1950s to post-2000s.
  13: The authors discuss the progression of flood management strategies in Asian
    coastal cities from before the 1990s to the 2000s and post-2000s, focusing on
    flood protection, flood risk management (FRM), and sustainable flood risk management
    (SFRM).
  14: Analysis of flood risk management strategies in several Asian cities, focusing
    on shifts in approaches over time. Applicable to understanding flood risk management
    in urban coastal environments, particularly in the context of rapid urbanization
    and climate change.
  15: This study reviews existing literature on sustainable flood risk management
    (SFRM) approaches in Asian coastal megacities, comparing traditional hard-engineering
    flood defenses with broader strategies.

    economies, and developmental pressure in addition to climate change-related flood
    hazards.
