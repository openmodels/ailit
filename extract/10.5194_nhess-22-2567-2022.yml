Drivers of Risk:
  1: Human factors (large population, rapid socio-economic growth, subsidence from
    excessive groundwater extraction) and natural factors (climate change including
    sea-level rise and land subsidence) are identified as drivers of flood risk.
  4: Climate change
  6: Climate change, demand for development land
  7: The 1993 Mississippi River flood.
  8: "Intensive rainfall events (> 50mm h\u22121) have increased in frequency by about\
    \ 50% over the last 30 years in Japan. Intensive rainfall events (> 100mm h\u2212\
    1) have more than doubled over the last 30 years in Japan. Japan has flood hazards\
    \ arising from typhoons, torrential rains, snowmelt, and tsunami."
Highlights:
  1: The paper highlights the importance of long-term Sustainable Flood Risk Management
    (SFRM) that considers social, economic, and environmental factors, particularly
    for developing coastal megacities.
  4: Flood damage in England and Wales is expected to rise significantly due to climate
    change.
  7: The 1993 Mississippi River flood caused over USD15 billion in economic damage
    and spurred a review of flood management approaches, leading to a focus on avoiding
    development in floodplains and managing floodplains as part of the natural ecosystem.
Methodology:
  1: The paper reviews past and current flood management experiences in the UK, Netherlands,
    USA, and Japan, focusing on the shift from flood defense to Sustainable Flood
    Risk Management (SFRM).
  6: Discussion of policy and engineering approaches to flood management
More Notes:
  6: The page primarily discusses flood risk management strategies, particularly in
    the Netherlands and the USA. It doesn't provide specific quantitative estimates
    of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes related to climate change adaptation at a
    national level. The focus is on the features and functions of flood risk management
    policies and engineering practices.

  20: No relevant information
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: The paper discusses the importance of integrating social, ecological, and economic
    themes into flood risk management practices, suggesting these themes impact economic
    outcomes.
  4: Forecast flood damage in England and Wales is currently GBP 1.4 billion annually
    but is expected to rise to as much as GBP 27 billion by 2100.
  6: Flood losses (implied)
  7: Economic damage from the 1993 Mississippi River flood was over USD15 billion.
  8: Economic losses due to pluvial flooding in Nagoya in 2000 were approximately
    JYP978 billion (ca. USD9.57 billion).
Quantitative material:
  4: GBP 1.4 billion annually (current flood damage), GBP 27 billion by 2100 (forecast
    flood damage).
  7: "Over USD15 billion in economic damage from the 1993 Mississippi River flood;\
    \ river flooding over 1200km of the river\u2019s length and about 840000km2 in\
    \ area."
  8: "Economic losses due to pluvial flooding in Nagoya in 2000: JYP978 billion (ca.\
    \ USD9.57 billion). > 50mm h\u22121 rainfall events frequency increase in Japan\
    \ over last 30 years: 50%. > 100mm h\u22121 rainfall events frequency increase\
    \ in Japan over last 30 years: more than doubled."
