Drivers of Risk:
  2: High temperatures
  6: High temperatures, water stress, reduced CO2 diffusion, potential increases in
    respiration, shorter growing seasons.
  7: "Exposure to high temperatures (30-36\xB0C and above 36\xB0C), temperature-induced\
    \ water stress, and limitations in the ability of elevated CO2 to buffer against\
    \ these stresses, especially for soybean due to increased transpiration needs."
  8: Shift towards higher temperatures from beneficial to detrimental poses a strong
    challenge for rainfed crop production.
Highlights:
  2: High temperatures are detrimental to crop yields; Crop models reproduce observed
    temperature responses of US crops; Water stress induced by high temperatures causes
    yield decline; Elevated CO2 can only weakly reduce yield losses compared to irrigation.
  6: "Temperature-induced water stress is the main driver of observed yield decline\
    \ at temperatures 43\xB0C/176\xB0C. Irrigation can alleviate this yield decline.\
    \ Direct damage from extremely high temperatures is of minor relevance in the\
    \ historical sample at a large spatial scale."
  7: Crop models reliably simulate temperature effects in the considered range. Elevated
    CO2 has limited potential to buffer against detrimental effects of temperature-induced
    water stress on crop yields, especially for soybean. Direct temperature-induced
    damages may become more relevant under future climate change.
  8: Current crop models can reliably assess crop losses induced by temperatures in
    the range from 30 to 36 /C176C.
Methodology:
  2: Ensemble of nine crop models reproducing observed temperature responses of US
    maize, soybean, and wheat yields.
  6: Crop models (GGCMs) are used and compared with observed yield data to investigate
    the mechanisms of yield decline. Statistical approach sensitive to yield losses
    induced by extremely high temperatures.
  7: The analysis uses crop models to simulate temperature effects on yields, historical
    observations and temperature shifts projected by HadGEM2-ES under RCP8.5. The
    models take into account the effect of CO2 on plant growth and water usage. Only
    rainfed counties are considered for future interaction analysis. A regression
    model is fitted for each county
  8: A panel regression model is fitted separately to observed and simulated crop
    yields for all US counties, individually for rainfed and irrigated counties.
More Notes:
  2: "Analysis focuses on US crops (maize, soybean, wheat); Wheat shows less negative\
    \ response to high temperatures historically; Future yields are modelled to decline\
    \ for all three crops at temperatures >30\xB0C."
  6: The models do not explicitly account for leaf temperature differences to ambient
    air or potential increases in photorespiration in C4 plants. Models simulate shorter
    growing seasons with increasing temperature. Seven of nine models include a direct
    effect of temperature on maintenance respiration.
  7: GGCM simulations do not commonly account for potential adaptation options. The
    models capture the relevant mechanisms that lower yields at high temperatures.
    Caution needs to be exercised also when extrapolating historical temperature.
  8: The crop models used here do not represent all potentially detrimental effects
    of high temperature. Short-term changes in management, such as fertilizer input,
    or diseases and pests also influence observed yield fluctuations but are often
    not well documented and also not always represented in the models.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Agricultural productivity; Crop yields (maize, soybean, and wheat)
  6: Crop yield decline due to high temperatures, impacting productivity.
  7: "Yield losses for maize, soybean, and wheat due to increased exposure to temperatures\
    \ in the range from 30\xB0C to 36\xB0C."
  8: Crop yield losses are induced by temperatures in the range from 30 to 36 /C176C.
Quantitative material:
  2: "Each day >30\xB0C diminishes maize and soybean yields by up to 6% under rainfed\
    \ conditions."
  6: "Wheat yield negatively impacted at temperatures 43\xB0C/176\xB0C; Maize experiences\
    \ 10.8 days, and soybean 13.1 days on average of growing season temperatures at\
    \ that level.  Kansas field trials show wheat sensitivity to temperatures above\
    \ 34\xB0C in spring."
  7: "Estimated yield losses under high levels of global warming (exposure to temperatures\
    \ between 30\xB0C and 36\xB0C) alone implies yield losses of 49% for maize, 40%\
    \ for soybean and 22% for wheat."
  8: Analysis uses daily temperature (maximum and minimum) and precipitation data
    from 1980-2010.
