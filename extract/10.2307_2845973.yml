  21: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change altering forest productivity; large-scale dieback (extensive forest
    mortality)
  7: Changes in climate and other environmental factors influencing forest productivity
    (e.g., carbon and nitrogen cycling).
  8: Climate change is a major driver of risk, impacting forest growth, timberland
    area, and removals, ultimately affecting the timber market and carbon sequestration.
  10: Changes in climate, specifically increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (doubling
    to 625 ppm) and associated temperature and precipitation changes.
  20: Projected climate and carbon dioxide change; climate-only change.
  21: Climate change impacts on forest productivity.
  22: Climate-induced changes in production in agriculture and forestry, climate change
    impacts on forest growth, fire, beetle outbreaks.
  25: Climate change causing dieback and regeneration impacts on forests.
  27: Climate change impacts on forest sector activity, specifically changes in Net
    Primary Productivity (NPP).
  28: Climate change scenarios (low, midrange, high emission), ecological impacts,
    timber supply assumptions, uncertainty in economic models
  29: Different climate change scenarios (high, moderate, and low emission scenarios)
    impacting forest product prices and harvests.
  30: Changes in climate scenarios and assumptions about trade in forest products
    are important factors influencing effects on the global forest sector.
  32: Uncertainty in future climate projections; future trends in greenhouse gas emissions
    influenced by economic activity, population growth, and energy demand.
  34: Changes in carbon dioxide levels, climate change-induced disturbances (catastrophic
    fires, droughts), altered forest succession, species migration, land-use change
    (agriculture to forestry or vice versa, urbanization).
Highlights:
  2: The forest sector is remarkably adaptable in the face of potential climate changes.
    Climate change is likely to alter forest productivity with potential increases
    in the near future. Regional impacts differ greatly. Increases in the timber inventory
    lead eventually to lower prices.
  10: Climate change could increase temperate forest NPP in the USA by 8-27%. Timber
    management could potentially enhance forest productivity to a larger degree (25-39%).
  20: Forest growth and inventory response is greater under the climate and carbon
    dioxide change scenario than the climate-only scenario.
  21: FASOM is a multiperiod, nonlinear, price-endogenous, mathematical intertemporal
    optimization programming, economic model that provides 100-year projections of
    forest sector production, prices, and welfare.
  22: Total forest production increases, hardwood output is higher in all scenarios
    whereas softwood output increases only under moderate warming. Increased forest
    growth translates into higher forest production. Timber and wood product markets
    will likely be able to adjust and adapt to climate change.
  25: Climate change can have both positive and negative impacts on timber market
    surplus, with the specific impact depending on the climate model, biogeochemical
    model, and whether the impact is due to dieback or regeneration. Under the dieback
    scenarios the impact is mainly positive. Under the regeneration scenarios the
    impact is also positive.
  27: Climate change generally hurts timber-producing regions and benefits consumers
    of forest products.
  28: Uncertainty in economic models appears to be at least as great as the uncertainty
    in Global Climate Models (GCMs). Higher growth in timber stock leads to larger
    timber growing stock, lowers log prices, increases consumption, and improves total
    economic welfare under all climate scenarios. Regional results vary considerably
    among themselves and with the global results.
  29: Globally, economic welfare increases due to climate change impacts on forest
    product markets, but the distribution of gains and losses varies across regions.
    Low-cost wood fiber production regions expand harvests, while higher-cost regions
    decrease harvests. The magnitude of welfare change depends on the climate change
    scenario.
  30: Forest area expands 22-29%, though mostly in less productive and inaccessible
    regions.
  32: Emphasizes the need for consistency in economic assumptions underlying climate
    and emission scenarios in forest sector analyses.
Methodology:
  2: Analytical tools are used to quantify impacts of climate change on forest productivity,
    forest diversity, and supply/demand for wood products. RPA-FOREST SERVICE POLICY
    ANALYSIS is mentioned.
  7: A modeling framework was developed to assess climate change in the forest sector.
    This involved linking climate models, ecological models (specifically the Terrestrial
    Ecosystem Model - TEM), and a forest sector model (the Assessment System). The
    framework modified the Assessment System by incorporating information from climate
    and biogeochemical models to modify growth coefficients in ATLAS.
  8: The page describes a modeling framework that integrates economic data, climate
    data, and forest inventory data. Models used include NAWEM (potentially related
    to pulp and paper), a Timber Market Assessment Model, ATLAS and ATLASC, FORCARB
    and HARVCARB.
  10: "Climate models were run for current and future (doubled CO2) climates, then\
    \ used as input for the TEM (Terrestrial Ecosystem Model) to project ecosystem\
    \ productivity. Climate scenarios encompassed temperature changes of 2.8-4.2\xB0\
    C and precipitation changes from 7.8% to 11%. Applicable around 2065 under the\
    \ IPCC business-as-usual scenario."
  16: Changes from the 1993 RPA Timber Assessment were developed using changes in
    Net Primary Productivity (NPP) over the projection period of 1991-2065. Changes
    from the 2005 Timber Assessment were developed using changes in vegetation biomass,
    and the same time periods (1991-2065) are summarized.
  20: TEM-Timber Assessment Projection System analyses
  21: Forest sector market models with intertemporal optimization, specifically FASOM,
    are used to explore the impact of climate change on forestry, projecting production,
    prices, and welfare over 100 years. Climate change impacts on forest productivity
    are used as input to set the context.
  22: FASOM examines land-use shifts between agriculture and forestry as sectors adjust
    to climate-induced production changes. The 2005 RPA analyses impacts of climate
    change on the growth of trees.
  25: The net present value is measured with a discount rate of 5%.
  27: Analysis uses four climate scenarios and two economic scenarios.  The analysis
    computes net present value with a 4% real discount rate. Incorporates economic
    adjustments related to trade.
  28: Uses a Computable General Trade Model (CGTM) coupled with the TEM model to simulate
    vegetation carbon dynamics and analyze impacts on the global forest sector; transient
    climate change scenarios for 1990-2100 from the integrated global system model
    (IGSM)
  29: A global trade model is used to simulate the impacts of climate change on forest
    product markets. Welfare changes are calculated as the sum of economic welfare
    to the timber producer, log processor, and product consumer. Results are applicable
    to major forest sector markets, including the USA, Canada, Chile, New Zealand,
    western continental Europe, Finland, Sweden, and Japan. Uses intensive and extensive
    margin analysis.
  30: The analysis uses a forest sector model with intertemporal optimization, incorporating
    ecosystem and management types, and climate scenarios.
  32: Uses multiple climate models and emissions scenarios to address uncertainty
    in predictions and develop climate scenarios for ecological and economic modeling.
  34: Forest sector models are used, sometimes incorporating ecological models. FASOM
    analyses incorporate land-use change between agriculture and forestry.
More Notes:
  8: The framework appears to focus on the impact of climate change on forest resources
    and timber markets. The specific links to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes are
    not detailed on this page, but could be inferred through the economic impacts
    of changes in the forest sector. The framework uses climate data to affect forest
    inventories to affect removals.
  20: Inventory changes are gradual, and their impacts on timber harvest, prices,
    and product markets are relatively small and extend over the projection period;
    impacts are muted by interregional and international substitution.
  25: The table presents results for different combinations of biogeographical models
    (DOLY, BIOME2, MAPSS) and climate models (UKMO, OSU).
  27: The analysis suggests that including more economic adjustments reduces the measured
    impact of climate change, and without these details, the impact was overstated.
    Trade tends to dampen the effects of NPP changes.
  29: The analysis focuses on the forest product sector. Price declines range from
    near zero (Canada) to more than 7% (Scandinavian region). Welfare responses can
    be positive or negative depending on the region and scenario.
  32: Focus is on forestry sector and climate models' evolution for ecological impact
    analysis, not directly on national macroeconomic or fiscal analyses.
  34: The paper focuses on the impacts of climate change on forest sector models.
    There are limitations in modeling forest successional processes, vegetation management
    influence, and species migration.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Producer welfare declines, but consumers generally gain due to lower prices.
  8: This page describes a modeling framework related to climate change assessments,
    focusing on forest resources, with a potential link to economic activity through
    timber markets and carbon sequestration. Direct macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes
    are not explicitly stated on this page, but there is a mention of forest growth
    and timber removals, which could implicitly affect the economy.
