Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change and regional population growth.
  4: Climate change scenarios (RCP2.6-SSP2 and RCP6.0-SSP3) and population growth
    differences (SSP2 and SSP3) impacting water availability.
  6: Increased water scarcity due to climate change. Declining human population in
    the future relieves water scarcity.
  7: Climate change scenarios (RCP6.0 vs RCP2.6) and population scenarios (SSP3 vs
    SSP2) are primary drivers of water scarcity risks.
Highlights:
  2: "Historically (1901\u20132020), FirstWS occurred predominantly in Asia and Africa,\
    \ peaking around the 1980s. Under future scenarios (2021\u20132090), FirstWS will\
    \ likely occur mainly in some regions of Africa. EndWS will mostly occur in China\
    \ after 2050 due to projected declining population."
  4: Water scarcity (FirstWS) varies across regions and is predicted to increase significantly
    in Africa and Asia by 2090.
  6: Water scarcity disappearance is most pronounced in East Asia (China) and Central
    Europe. Declining populations relieve water scarcity. China will see the greatest
    area of water scarcity relief.
  7: High population growth (SSP3) can significantly aggravate water scarcity, leading
    to advanced 'FirstWS' and delayed 'EndWS'. Future water scarcity is more impacted
    by future population differences, but is also impacted by future climate differences.
Methodology:
  2: "Ensembles of simulations with six Global Hydrological Models under two representative\
    \ concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP6.0) combined with two shared socioeconomic\
    \ pathways (SSP2, SSP3) for 1901\u20132090."
  4: Analysis based on 24 GHM-GCM combinations for determining the spatial distribution
    of FirstWS from 1901 to 2090.
  6: Uses 24 GHM-GCM models regarding future water availability and population sizes
    to project disappearance time of water scarcity (EndWS), defined as the first
    year when water scarcity is relieved for a continuous period of five years or
    more, and the scarcity-free state remains until the end of the 21st century. Analyzes
    spatial distributions of EndWS under RCP6.0-SSP2 and RCP2.6-SSP3 scenarios.
  7: The analysis compares 'FirstWS' and 'EndWS' between different climate change
    scenarios (RCP6.0 vs RCP2.6) while keeping population constant (SSP2), and between
    different population scenarios (SSP3 vs SSP2) while keeping climate constant (RCP2.6).
    'FirstWS' is the initial year per-capita water availability falls below 1000 m3/person/year
    for 5 consecutive years. 'EndWS' is the first year water scarcity is relieved
    for 5 consecutive years until the end of the 21st century. Six Global Hydrological
    Models (GHMs) and four General Circulation Models (GCMs) are used.
More Notes:
  4: Africa, particularly East, West, and North Africa, is identified as a high-risk
    area for future water scarcity.
  6: The temporal evolution of AEndWS (annual total area with newly disappeared water
    scarcity) is presented. The study identifies the top ten countries with the largest
    AEndWS between 1901 and 2090.
  7: The evolution of water availability is not even among different regions, leading
    to spatial variations in 'FirstWS' and 'EndWS'. Delayed 'FirstWS' is shown to
    occur in Southern Africa and South Asia (India) under RCP6.0 vs RCP2.6.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Freshwater resource availability per capita below a certain threshold (water
    scarcity).
  6: No relevant information
  7: Per-capita water availability falling below 1000 m3/person/year is a key metric.
    Alleviation or aggravation of water scarcity is assessed based on changes in 'FirstWS'
    and 'EndWS'.
Quantitative material:
  2: "Assessment of the timing of the first emergence of water scarcity (FirstWS)\
    \ and disappearance of water scarcity (EndWS) using ensembles of simulations with\
    \ six Global Hydrological Models under two representative concentration pathways\
    \ (RCP2.6, RCP6.0) combined with two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP2, SSP3)\
    \ for 1901\u20132090."
  7: "The study quantifies the total areas (million km2) affected by advances or delays\
    \ in 'FirstWS' and 'EndWS' under different scenarios, as well as the number of\
    \ people relieved from water scarcity (\u2211PEndWS)."
