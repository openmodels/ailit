Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate-related natural disasters (flash floods, surges, cyclones, severe storms)
  2: Climate-related natural disasters including flash floods, surges, cyclones, blizzards,
    and severe storms.
  3: Climatic natural disasters; Weather-related disasters likely to become more frequent
    due to climate change.
  4: Climate-related disasters such as floods, strong winds, and cyclones cause damage
    to infrastructure and agricultural productivity.
  6: Climate-related disasters, specifically floods and storms
  7: Natural disasters, such as floods and storms, and their timing within the year.
  8: Climate-related disasters (floods and storms), measured by the time-weighted
    population affected.
  9: Population affected by climate-related disasters (floods, storms, climatic disaster
    dummy)
  10: Climate-related disasters (Earthquakes, Volcanoes, Droughts), Openness, Trade,
    Real FDI inflow, Real FDI outflow, Inflation
  11: Climatic disasters impacting economic growth and potential risk of armed civil
    conflict onset.
  12: Climatic disasters (specifically as measured by population affected).
  13: Conflict onset and conflict incidence impacting economic outcomes.
  14: Sudden climatic disasters (storms and floods)
Highlights:
  1: Climate-related natural disasters have a negative effect on economic growth.
  3: The short-run effects of disasters on economic growth are a matter of dynamics
    and the selected time frame, and hence an empirical question. Surprisingly little
    research has been conducted to identify the relationship between climatic natural
    disasters and economic growth.
  4: Climate-related natural disasters have a negative impact on economic growth,
    which may increase the risk of armed conflict onset.
  5: Climate-related events serve as exogenous events in their second-stage analysis.
  6: The study investigates the impact of climate-related disasters (floods and storms)
    on average annual real GDP per capita growth.
  8: Climatic natural disasters have a negative and statistically significant impact
    on per capita economic growth.
  9: Climate-related disasters, particularly floods and storms, have a statistically
    significant negative impact on GDP/capita growth.
  10: Climate-related disasters negatively affect GDP/capita growth (negative coefficients
    on related variables), but the magnitude of the coefficients is typically small.
  11: Climatic disasters have robust and significant negative effects on short-term
    economic growth, and potentially increase the risk of armed civil conflicts through
    income effects.
  12: Climatic disasters do not directly affect conflict onset, but economic growth
    does, and disaster-triggered growth changes do not seem to affect conflict likelihood.
  13: Significant negative impact of conflict on GDP growth identified, with specific
    coefficient values demonstrating the effect.
  14: Storms and floods adversely affect people and production inputs such as land,
    infrastructure, and factories, which in turn have a negative impact on the aggregate
    economy.
Methodology:
  1: Econometric methods using historical data
  3: The article studies a set of weather-related disasters and their impact on economic
    growth and the risk of conflict.
  4: The study uses fixed-effects transformations to analyze the relationship between
    climate events, economic growth, and conflict onset.
  5: "Panel dataset covering 1980\u20132007, includes 171 independent countries and\
    \ 4,455 country-year observations. Control variables (lagged by one year) include\
    \ openness of economy (%), real investment share of GDP (%), real government share\
    \ of GDP (%), FDI inflow relative to GDP (%), FDI outflow relative to GDP (%),\
    \ inflation, population size (,000), democracy index."
  6: Uses disaster data from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) from 1900 onwards.
    Normalizes disaster size by dividing by the size of the affected population to
    account for magnitude.
  7: Economic growth effects are measured on an annual basis, correcting for event
    timing by weighting based on the disaster month. This involves normalizing affected
    population by the elapsed months since the event using a (12-event month)/12 formula.
  8: Regression models with country fixed effects and year dummies to control for
    global shocks; using lagged explanatory variables to address endogeneity; two-way
    error component model.
  9: Panel data regression with fixed country and year effects, robust t-statistics
    clustered on countries; sample period 1981-2007; Arellano & Bond (1991) estimator
    also applied as a robustness check.
  10: Panel data regression models with fixed effects, including time and country
    fixed effects, estimated using STATA. The models cover different time periods
    (1970-2007, 1980-2007). Robustness tests are performed.
  11: Instrumental variable analysis; first-stage equation identifies growth impacts,
    second-stage explores armed conflict risk.
  12: Panel data analysis (1980-2007), two-stage least squares (2SLS) analysis, fixed
    country and year effects, instrument for population affected by climatic disasters.
  13: Utilizes statistical models with coefficients and t-statistics derived from
    economic data, results applicable to contexts measuring conflict impacts.
  14: Analysis of data from 1980-2007.
More Notes:
  1: The analysis also examined the onset of armed conflict but found no increased
    risk due to climate-related natural disasters, even when accounting for GDP growth
    changes caused by these disasters.
  3: The article explores the link between climatic disasters, economic growth, and
    the occurrence of armed conflict.
  6: 'EM-DAT inclusion criteria: 10 or more casualties, 100 or more people affected,
    declaration of a state of emergency, or call for international assistance. The
    study focuses on climate-related disasters with rapid onsets (less than one month).'
  7: Several disaster events' impacts are aggregated, and control variables include
    trade openness, FDI, GDP, government expenditure, and inflation, all lagged by
    a year.
  8: The study attempts to address potential biases related to disaster impact exaggeration
    by developing countries seeking aid by using country fixed-effects models. Floods
    and storms have similar impacts on growth, so they are used in a combined measure.
  9: The study controls for lagged GDP/capita growth, trade openness, real investment
    share of GDP, real government share of GDP, FDI inflow and outflow, and inflation.
  10: Different model specifications are used with different sets of control variables
    (e.g., population, investment, government expenditure). The analysis uses different
    weighting schemes (e.g., population weights). Significance levels are indicated
    (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
  12: The paper tests the sensitivity of its results with several alternative specifications.
  14: Negative income shocks caused by climatic disasters do not increase the risk
    of armed civil conflict.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic growth
  2: Economic growth
  3: The short-run effects on economic growth (GDP).
  4: Climate-related disasters are expected to have a negative effect on economic
    growth, impacting income and production inputs.
  5: Real GDP per capita growth (%)
  6: Average annual real GDP per capita growth
  8: Per capita GDP growth rate
  9: GDP/capita growth
  10: GDP/capita growth, GDP/capita

    of 0.18 percentage points per percentage point increase in disaster variable.
  12: No significant direct effect of climate-related disasters on the risk of conflict
    onset. Economic growth is negatively linked to the risk of conflict onset (increases
    in economic growth reduce conflict onset risk).
  13: GDP/capita growth effects observed with coefficients indicating reductions associated
    with conflict onset.
  14: Aggregate income growth

    is considerable.
