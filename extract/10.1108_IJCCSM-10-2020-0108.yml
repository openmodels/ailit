Drivers of Risk:
  1: Positive and negative climate shocks.
  2: Climate change (increasing temperatures, natural disasters), climate policies
    (transition to a low-carbon economy), technology, conversion to a low-carbon economy
    (success or failure), physical risks (frequency and severity of climate disasters),
    transition risks (impact of climate policies).
  3: Natural disasters significantly increase the operational risk of banks in affected
    areas.
  4: Climate policies, increased temperatures (physical risks, transition risks),
    positive and negative climate shocks
  5: Positive and negative shocks to average temperature (TEMP) representing climate
    change.
  8: Average temperature (TEMP), temperature increase sequence (TEMP_i), temperature
    decrease sequence (TEMP_d)
  9: Temperature increases (TEMP_i and TEMP_d) are the drivers of risk to financial
    stability.
  10: Temperature changes (TEMP_d) and the conversion to a low-carbon economy affect
    financial stability.
  11: Positive and negative climate shocks (temperature changes)
  13: Positive and negative changes in CO2 concentration (CO2+, CO2-), Climate Disasters.
  14: Positive climate shocks (leading to physical risks like climate disasters) and
    negative climate shocks (leading to transition risks from climate policies).
  15: Physical risks and transition risks associated with climate change. Climate
    shocks, both positive and negative.
  19: Climate change
Highlights:
  1: Both positive and negative climate shocks harm financial stability. Positive
    climate shocks have a greater short-term effect on financial stability than negative
    shocks in the current period, but less in the lag period. Negative climate shocks
    bring larger long-term adjustments to financial stability than positive shocks.
    Climate change is more destructive to financial stability in the long run.
  2: Climate change is a source of risk for financial system stability; physical and
    transition risks are key mechanisms through which climate change affects financial
    stability; existing research lacks empirical evidence on the impact of climate
    change on financial stability; the study empirically tests the relationship between
    climate change and financial stability in China.
  3: Climate policies may cause economic recession, financial instability, and negative
    impacts on investor sentiment.
  4: Climate change has significant, nonlinear effects on the global economy and financial
    stability. The impact of climate change on financial stability can be nonlinear
    and path-dependent, potentially leading to domino effects when temperature thresholds
    are exceeded. The effect of positive and negative climate shocks on financial
    stability can be different, with time mismatches between investor/government decisions
    leading to long-term and short-term differences.
  5: The analysis focuses on quantifying the asymmetric effects of increasing vs.
    decreasing average temperatures on financial stability, suggesting that the impacts
    may not be symmetrical.
  8: The paper analyzes the impact of temperature increases and decreases on financial
    stability in China using a VAR model.
  9: A shock to TEMP_i has a significant negative impact on financial stability, which
    peaks in the fifth period and then stabilizes. The higher the temperature, the
    higher the frequency of climate disasters, resulting in greater economic and financial
    losses.
  10: The impact of a rapid conversion to a low-carbon economy on financial stability
    is greater than natural disasters caused by climate change.
  11: Climate change has a long-term asymmetric transmission effect on financial stability;
    the long-term damage of climate change on financial stability is greater than
    the short term; the impact of positive and negative climate shocks on financial
    stability begins to stabilize after the 30th period, reaching a long-term equilibrium.
  12: Climate change has a long-term negative asymmetry path to financial stability,
    though the degree is not large.
  13: Positive and negative changes in CO2 concentration have statistically significant
    impacts on financial stability. There are asymmetric long-run effects of positive
    and negative changes in CO2 on financial stability.
  14: Negative climate shocks are more destructive to financial stability in the long
    term compared to positive shocks; positive shocks have a greater impact in the
    short term. Climate change has a greater long-term impact on financial stability.
  15: Both positive and negative climate shocks harm financial stability. The relationship
    between climate change and financial stability is nonlinear and asymmetric. Negative
    climate shocks have a greater long-term effect on financial stability than positive
    shocks. Climate change is more destructive to financial stability in the long
    term than in the short term.

    \ effect of climate change on China\u2019s financial stability."
  2: Empirical analysis using China as a research object to test the relationship
    between climate change and financial stability; NARDL model adopted to empirically
    test the impact of climate change on financial stability. Considers asymmetric
    transmission effects of climate change on financial stability from short-term
    and long-term perspectives.
  3: Empirical research includes climate stress tests to assess the impact of climate
    policies on the portfolios of energy projects.
  4: Financial network approach, VAR model, NARDL model. VAR model is applicable for
    understanding the dynamic relationships between variables. NARDL model is designed
    for investigating nonlinear long-term and short-term effects.
  5: A Non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model is used to analyze
    the asymmetric effects of positive and negative temperature shocks on financial
    stability. The model decomposes temperature changes into positive and negative
    components and estimates their individual impacts on financial stability, accounting
    for long-term and short-term effects. The applicability of this model is for capturing
    non-linear relationships between climate change and financial stability.
  8: Vector Autoregression (VAR) model is used to analyze the asymmetric impact of
    climate change on China's financial stability. Unit root tests (ADF and PP) are
    conducted. Lag length criterion is used to determine the optimal lag order of
    the VAR model.
  9: Two VAR models with second order lags are built for temperature sequences TEMP_i
    and TEMP_d. ADF and PP tests are also performed.

    nonlinear and asymmetric effects.
