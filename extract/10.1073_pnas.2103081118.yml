Drivers of Risk:
  1: Thawing permafrost, ice sheet disintegration, changes in atmospheric circulation,
    dissociation of ocean methane hydrates.
  2: Tipping points impacting SCC include permafrost carbon feedback, dissociation
    of ocean methane hydrates, WAIS disintegration, GIS disintegration, variability
    of the Indian summer monsoon, and Amazon rainforest dieback.
  3: The drivers of risk are climate tipping points, including permafrost carbon release,
    ocean methane hydrate dissociation, slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
    Circulation (AMOC), weakening of the South Asian monsoon (SAF), Amazon dieback,
    collapse of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) and West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS),
    and changes in the Indian summer monsoon. These tipping points influence the SCC
    through their effects on climate damages.
  4: Climate tipping points, temperature changes.
  5: Disintegration of the GIS and WAIS primarily affects countries with low-lying
    coastal populations; Permafrost carbon feedback, dissociation of ocean methane
    hydrates, and the SAF primarily affect temperature; AMOC slowdown benefits Europe,
    while parts of central Asia see increased climate damages; Eight tipping points
    on warming and SLR.
  7: "The drivers of risk considered are climate tipping points, global mean surface\
    \ temperature, and sea level rise (SLR). The Indian summer monsoon is considered\
    \ as a driver of flood and drought risk in India. Specific tipping points mentioned\
    \ include AMOC slowdown, SAF weakening, permafrost carbon feedback, dissociation\
    \ of ocean methane hydrates, Amazon rainforest dieback, Boreal forest dieback,\
    \ variability of the West African monsoon, and the El Ni\u02DCno Southern Oscillation."
  8: The paper identifies the permafrost carbon feedback, dissociation of ocean methane
    hydrates, Arctic sea ice loss, dieback of the Amazon rainforest, and disintegration
    of the GIS and WAIS as drivers of risk.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Economic impacts of climate tipping points, focusing on the social cost of carbon
    (SCC).
  2: The primary metric evaluated is the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), which estimates
    the economic cost of emitting one additional ton of CO2.
  3: This paper evaluates the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and the impact of climate
    tipping points on it.
  4: Impact of climate tipping points on the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and global
    mean consumption per capita.
  5: Welfare changes are normalized to global mean consumption per capita; Consumption
    losses from the eight tipping points as a function of temperature; SCC is calculated
    by converting consumption losses into utility losses and then taking the discounted
    sum from 2020 until the end of the modeling horizon.
  7: This paper evaluates economic costs and the social cost of carbon (SCC).
Highlights:
  1: Climate tipping points increase global economic risk and increase economic losses
    almost everywhere; the tipping points with the largest effects are dissociation
    of ocean methane hydrates and thawing permafrost.
  2: Key findings include a probable underestimation of SCC increases due to missing
    impact channels and interactions, with a median SCC increase of 18.8% from all
    tipping points.
  3: Climate tipping points, in general, increase the expected SCC. However, some
    tipping points (AMOC, SAF) can decrease the SCC. Interactions between tipping
    points are complex, with positive and negative interactions offsetting each other.
    The effect of ocean methane hydrates on the SCC is sensitive to the emissions
    impulse scenario.
  4: Climate tipping points increase the expected SCC, leading to a more unequal distribution
    of climate impacts across countries and increased consumption risk.
  5: Tipping points increase the temperature response to GHG emissions over most of
    the range of temperatures attained; The reduced-form climate tipping points damage
    function could be integrated in other IAMs.
  7: Climate tipping points increase the overall level of risk in the global economy
    and increase economic costs almost everywhere. Climate tipping points do not have
    a significant effect on inequality.
  8: The paper discusses the slowdown of the AMOC and its impact on the relationship
    between global and national mean surface temperatures, and how the variability
    of the Indian summer monsoon affects GDP per capita in India.
Methodology:
  1: Uses a meta-analytic integrated assessment model (IAM) with a modular structure,
    calibrated on detailed econometric evidence and simulation modeling; includes
    national-level climate damages from rising temperatures and sea levels for 180
    countries.
  2: The analysis is performed using a meta-analytic IAM, synthesizing literature
    data and employing Monte Carlo simulations with a sample size of 10,000.
  3: The analysis uses Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 draws with 0.1% trimmed) with
    RCP4.5-SSP2 emissions and GDP/population growth scenarios. It also considers uncertainty
    in the pure rate of time preference and the elasticity of marginal utility of
    consumption. A flexible specification of climate damages is adopted that allows
    the damage to impact both the level and growth rate of income.
  4: Meta-analytic IAM (Integrated Assessment Model) with country-level resolution
    used to estimate national SCCs. Monte Carlo simulations used to assess uncertainty.
  5: Monte Carlo sample size is 10,000 with 0.1% trimmed; Results apply to RCP4.5-SSP2
    emissions and GDP/population growth, Hope and Schaefer PCF, Whiteman et al. beta
    OMH, and IPSL AMOC hosing.
  7: The analysis uses a meta-analytic Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) with components
    for greenhouse gas emissions, atmospheric chemistry and warming (using the FAIR
    model), country-level temperature damages, country-level damages from SLR, and
    flood and drought due to the Indian Summer Monsoon. The time horizon extends beyond
    2100. The applicability is for global economic analysis under different climate
    scenarios.
  8: The analysis uses a Monte Carlo simulation with a sample size of 10,000 to estimate
    the social cost of carbon by running the model twice, once with a baseline and
    once with an additional pulse of emissions in 2020.
More Notes:
  1: The authors claim their numbers are probable underestimates because some tipping
    points, tipping point interactions, and impact channels have not been covered
    in the literature.
  3: The effect of risk aversion on the SCC is significant. With high risk aversion,
    the increase in the SCC due to tipping points can be much larger, driven by the
    tail of the distribution. The specification of climate damages, particularly whether
    damages affect the level or growth rate of economic activity, is also an important
    driver.
  4: The study explores the sensitivity of results to different interpretations of
    how temperature impacts income (levels vs. growth damages).
  5: SI Appendix disaggregates the temperature response by tipping point and shows
    melting of the GIS and WAIS each contributes roughly half of the total SLR.
  7: The study acknowledges limitations including incomplete coverage of climate tipping
    points, interactions between them, missing climate impacts, and uncertainties
    in the tipping point modules and the IAM. It also discusses the choice between
    modeling damages as affecting the level or growth rate of output.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Climate tipping points increase the social cost of carbon (SCC) by \u223C25%\
    \ in our main speci\uFB01cation; an \u223C10% chance of climate tipping points\
    \ more than doubling the SCC."
  2: Combining all eight tipping points increases the expected SCC by 24.5%; individual
    contributions are dissociation of ocean methane hydrates (+13.1%), permafrost
    carbon feedback (+8.4%), WAIS disintegration (+2.9%), GIS disintegration (+1.8%),
    India's monsoon variability (+1.3%), and Amazon dieback (+0.1%).
  3: The expected SCC without tipping points is $52.03/tCO2 (2020 US dollars). Including
    all tipping points increases the expected SCC to $64.80/tCO2, a 24.5% increase.
    Individual tipping points have varying effects, ranging from a decrease of -1.7%
    (SAF) to an increase of 13.1% (Ocean methane hydrates).  Including only costly
    tipping points increases the expected SCC by 28.9%.
  4: Expected increase in SCC of 42.8% due to climate tipping points (95% CI of -0.3
    to +186.0%). Gini coefficient of national SCCs is 0.64 with tipping points, compared
    with 0.66 without. Population weighted correlation between national GDP per capita
    and national SCCs is -0.326 without tipping points and -0.335 with tipping points.
    Tipping points increase the coefficient of variation of global mean consumption
    per capita by 79% in 2050 and 34% in 2100.
  5: "Tipping points reduce global consumption per capita by around 1% upon 3\u25E6\
    C warming and by around 1.4% upon 6\u25E6C warming, based on a second-order polynomial\
    \ \uFB01t of the data; Some runs show damages exceeding 4%; Linear fit of the\
    \ data implies 61% more SLR at any given level; 2\u25E6C warming in the absence\
    \ of tipping points corresponds to 2.3 \u25E6C warming in the presence of tipping\
    \ points."
  7: The paper quantifies the effect of tipping points on the SCC and provides projections
    of temperature and SLR.
