Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate tipping points like thawing permafrost, ice sheet disintegration, dissociation
    of ocean methane hydrates, changes in atmospheric circulation and thawing permafrost.
  2: 'Tipping points in the climate system, specifically: positive carbon-cycle and
    temperature feedbacks, ice sheet disintegration, and changes in large-scale circulation.'
  3: Tipping points like permafrost carbon feedback, ocean methane hydrates, SAF weakening,
    Amazon deforestation, GIS, WAIS, AMOC slowdown, and the Indian summer monsoon.
  4: Climate tipping points.
  5: Climate tipping points including disintegration of the Greenland and West Antarctic
    Ice Sheets (GIS and WAIS), permafrost carbon feedback, dissociation of ocean methane
    hydrates, slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC),
    and weakening of the Southern Annular Mode (SAF).
  7: Climate tipping points, such as AMOC slowdown and changes in the SAF, increase
    the overall level of risk in the global economy.
  8: The page discusses various climate-related tipping points, including permafrost
    carbon feedback, dissociation of ocean methane hydrates, Arctic sea ice loss,
    dieback of the Amazon rainforest, and disintegration of the Greenland and West
    Antarctic ice sheets (GIS and WAIS), along with slowdown of the AMOC and variability
    of the Indian summer monsoon.
Highlights:
  1: "Climate tipping points increase global economic risk. The tipping points with\
    \ the largest effects are dissociation of ocean methane hydrates and thawing permafrost.\
    \ Climate tipping points increase the social cost of carbon (SCC) by \u223C25%."
  2: The increase in SCC due to ice sheet disintegration (WAIS & GIS) might be underestimated
    due to differences with process-based models.
  3: Collective impact of all tipping points increases expected SCC by 24.5%; impact
    of costly tipping points is 28.9%.
  4: Tipping points increase the SCC and lead to more unequal distribution of climate
    impacts (higher SCC in poorer countries).
  5: Climate tipping points increase the temperature response to GHG emissions and
    SLR. Disintegration of GIS and WAIS primarily affects countries with low-lying
    coastal populations. AMOC slowdown benefits Europe, while parts of central Asia
    see increased climate damages.
  7: Climate tipping points increase the expected social cost of carbon (SCC) and
    raise investment premiums due to higher associated risks.
Methodology:
  1: Meta-analytic integrated assessment model (IAM) with a modular structure including
    national-level climate damages for 180 countries calibrated on econometric evidence
    and simulation modeling.
  2: Monte Carlo simulation with a sample size of 10,000 is used to estimate the change
    in the SCC due to tipping points.
  3: Analysis is performed using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations over RCP4.5-SSP2 emissions
    and GDP/population growth scenarios, incorporating tipping points individually
    and collectively.
  4: Meta-analytic Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) with country-level resolution.
    Monte Carlo simulations are performed to estimate the impact of tipping points
    on SCC and global mean consumption.
  5: Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) framework incorporating climate tipping points.
    Monte Carlo simulations with 10,000 samples and 0.1% trimmed. Reduced-form climate
    tipping points damage function is derived to be integrated into other IAMs. The
    Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is calculated by converting consumption losses into
    utility losses and then taking the discounted sum from 2020 until the end of the
    modeling horizon.
  7: Meta-analytic Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) incorporating various climate
    tipping points with nonlinear, country-specific damage functions.
  8: The study uses a simulation model and Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the
    Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). The model is run twice, once with baseline conditions
    and again with an additional pulse of CO2 emissions in 2020. The SCC is calculated
    as the scaled difference in welfare between the two runs per ton of CO2 emissions,
    with a typical sample size of 10,000.
More Notes:
  1: The study presents a reduced-form tipping points damage function that could be
    incorporated in other IAMs. The numbers are probable underestimates, given that
    some tipping points, tipping point interactions, and impact channels have not
    been covered in the literature so far.
  2: The study acknowledges that the synthesized literature may not cover all tipping
    points or capture all possible impact channels and interactions.
  3: Interactions between tipping points do not significantly affect overall SCC due
    to offsetting positive and negative interactions.
  4: The analysis considers the impact of different specifications of the damage function,
    including pure growth damages, on the SCC. The results are sensitive to the chosen
    specification, with pure growth damages leading to substantially higher SCCs.
  5: The study disaggregates the temperature response by tipping point. The greater
    initial temperature response is primarily due to dissociation of ocean methane
    hydrates and to a lesser extent, the permafrost carbon feedback, while the eventually
    lower temperature response is due entirely to the weakening SAF.
  7: The modular approach allows for the inclusion of additional tipping points and
    interactions in the future.
  8: The model incorporates modules that replicate underlying studies of the specified
    tipping points and their impacts.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Social cost of carbon (SCC), global GDP, national-level climate damages from
    rising temperatures and sea levels.
  2: Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is the main economic impact metric.
  3: Increase in the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) due to various tipping points.
  4: Impacts on national Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) and global mean consumption per
    capita.
  5: Consumption losses due to climate tipping points, measured as a percentage change
    in global consumption per capita.
  7: Climate tipping points increase economic costs almost everywhere.
  8: GDP per capita is directly affected by the variability of the Indian summer monsoon.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Climate tipping points increase the social cost of carbon (SCC) by \u223C25%\
    \ in our main speci\uFB01cation. \u223C10% chance of climate tipping points more\
    \ than doubling the SCC."
  2: Slowdown of the AMOC reduces the expected SCC by 1.4%. The Surface Albedo Feedback
    (SAF) reduces the expected SCC by 1.7%.
  3: Social Cost of Carbon without tipping points is $52.03/tCO2 and increases by
    differing percentages depending on tipping point interactions.
  4: National SCC Gini coefficient increases from 0.66 to 0.64 with tipping points.
    Correlation between national GDP per capita and national SCC is -0.326 without
    tipping points, and -0.335 with tipping points. Expected increase in the SCC of
    42.8% due to climate tipping points (95% CI of -0.3 to +186.0%). Tipping points
    increase the coefficient of variation of global mean consumption per capita by
    79% in 2050 and 34% in 2100.
  5: "Tipping points reduce global consumption per capita by around 1% upon 3\xB0\
    C warming and by around 1.4% upon 6\xB0C warming, based on a second-order polynomial\
    \ fit of the data. In some runs, damages exceed 4%. A linear fit of SLR data implies\
    \ 61% more SLR at any given level due to tipping points."
