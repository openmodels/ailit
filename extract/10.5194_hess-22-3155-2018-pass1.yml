Drivers of Risk:
  1: Interannual hydroclimatic variability (ENSO, precipitation, temperature, river
    streamflow); Interdecadal variability (low-frequency trends and multidecadal oscillations);
    South Atlantic, Indian and Pacific SSTs.
  2: Interannual-to-multidecadal hydroclimate variability affecting precipitation,
    streamflow, and temperatures over northeastern Argentina.
  3: Changes and variability of regional precipitation, flows, and temperature, as
    well as external forcing from Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs). Hydroclimatic variability
    (interannual to multidecadal).
  6: Interannual-to-multidecadal hydroclimate variability as reflected in sea surface
    temperature (SST) and precipitation patterns.
  7: "Interannual and decadal-to-multidecadal hydroclimate variability (precipitation,\
    \ streamflow, temperature) in the NEA region. Specific drivers mentioned include\
    \ ENSO (El Ni\xF1o-Southern Oscillation) and SST patterns in the North Tropical\
    \ Atlantic Ocean and South Atlantic Convergence Zone."
  8: "Floods in the Paran\xE1 River are influenced by interannual variability and\
    \ extreme El Ni\xF1o events. Excess precipitation in the Upper Paran\xE1 Basin\
    \ linked to El Ni\xF1o events is a driver of floods. Local precipitation in the\
    \ NEA (North-East Argentina) with a periodicity of 2.5 years intensified the highest\
    \ floods."
  11: "El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a events (interannual variability); Decadal to multidecadal\
    \ precipitation variability; Hydroclimate variability and its extremes."
  12: Interannual and multidecadal hydrological variability leading to extreme events
    (floods and droughts); shift to a positive phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal
    Oscillation; land use changes disrupting natural water and biogeochemical cycles.
  13: Hydroclimate variability including river floods, pluvial floods, and droughts
    impacting urban and rural settlements.
  14: Interannual-to-multidecadal hydroclimate variability, including extreme ENSO
    conditions and SST forcing, affecting water resources, agriculture, and human
    settlements.
  15: Interannual and multidecadal hydroclimatic variability intensified extreme events
    like severe droughts and large floods.

Highlights:
  1: Hydroclimate variability at all timescales had significant sectoral impacts in
    northeastern Argentina.
  2: Provides an integrated and comprehensive discussion on sectoral impacts of variability
    at different timescales, contributing to actions and policies for increasing resilience
    to extreme events.
  7: Hydroclimate variability in NEA exhibits spectral peaks on interannual and decadal-to-multidecadal
    timescales. Interannual modes account for more than 50% of temporal variability
    for most variables except minimum temperature (30%). Precipitation variability
    with periodicities between 2.5 and 4 years can exacerbate extreme events even
    during moderate ENSO phases.
  8: "Extraordinary floods of the Paran\xE1 River occurred during strong or very strong\
    \ El Ni\xF1o events. The 6-year cycle is the largest contributor to the formation\
    \ of extraordinary floods."
  11: Hydroclimate variability at interannual to multidecadal timescales significantly
    impacts water resources, leading to floods, droughts, and changes in water availability.
  12: Floods and droughts, driven by hydroclimatic variability and land use changes,
    have caused significant economic losses in the agricultural sector of Argentina.
  13: "River floods and pluvial floods have caused significant economic damage and\
    \ affected various populations in the Lower Paran\xE1 basin."
  14: The region experienced transitions from dry and cooler to wet and warmer conditions
    since the 1970s, impacting agriculture and land use changes.
  15: Since the mid-2000s, northeastern Argentina has been showing signs of a reversal
    in the wetting period on multidecadal timescales, which might lead to more severe
    droughts and weaker floods if conditions persist.

    and decadal-to-multidecadal variability modes. Pearson correlation coefficients

    iterations considering autocorrelation by resampling in the frequency domain.
