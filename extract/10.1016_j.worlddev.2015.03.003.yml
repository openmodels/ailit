Drivers of Risk:
  6: Drought impacts health outcomes and increases health expenditures.
  7: Increasing prevalence of drought-like conditions due to poorly distributed rainfall,
    deforestation, cultivation of water-intensive crops, and increased unregulated
    industrial activity.
  8: Drought incidence.
  14: Rainfall deficits relative to historical averages.
  15: Drought severity and its impacts on health are considered as primary risks,
    with the empirical analysis using province fixed-effects to model this relationship.
  16: Rainfall shortage (drought severity varying between 55 and 993 mm) across different
    regions of Vietnam, with varying annual precipitation exceeding 1000 mm in most
    districts.
  17: Drought severity
  18: Drought severity (3-month average)
  20: Drought severity, demographic factors (age, gender), economic factors (consumption,
    income sources, asset index).
  21: Drought, dependency on the agricultural sector (income), asset position of households,
    availability of off-farm income sources
  22: Drought severity
  24: Drought severity, 3-month average drought (1/0), Health shocks on the household
  25: Drought is the main driver of risk, leading to increased illness.
  26: Drought-related illnesses impact rural economies, especially those dependent
    on agriculture.
  27: Drought-related health shocks can pose non-negligible financial costs.
Highlights:
  6: Drought leads to a deterioration of health conditions, particularly for the working-age
    population, and significantly higher health expenditures in rural Vietnam.
  8: Identification of population groups most vulnerable to drought shocks to inform
    economic and social policy.
  15: Health expenditures per capita vary significantly, indicating high variability
    in spending on health, which may reflect economic burdens.
  17: Individuals who live in a district that was more affected by drought on average
    show a significantly higher likelihood of suffering from a health shock.
  18: Drought severity has a statistically significant impact on the probability of
    illness at the household member level. However, there is no significant association
    between BMI levels or BMI drops and drought for individuals above the age of 15.
  20: Drought severity is positively and significantly associated with illness and
    rice price. Age and gender are significant determinants of vulnerability to drought-related
    illness. Higher total consumption per capita is associated with lower illness.
    The effect of drought on individual illness prevails in households with a greater
    dependency on agriculture as an income source.
  21: Drought impacts health through its adverse effects on the agricultural sector
    (income). Drought on average triggers rice prices upwards.
  22: Drought severity is significantly associated with illness. The relationship
    between drought and illness is moderated by various insurance mechanisms (HCFP,
    private health insurance, social networks) and ethnic fractionalization/minority
    status.  Specifically, participation in the HCFP scheme appears to reduce the
    negative impact of drought on illness, while ethnic fractionalization and being
    part of an ethnic minority can increase the negative impact of drought on illness.
  24: Drought severity and health shocks significantly impact household health expenditures.
    Income and budget constraints seem to play a moderating role. Age and gender impact
    health expenditures
  25: Drought-related illness has a significant impact on household health expenditures,
    especially in lower-income households.
  26: Drought increases likelihood of illness and health expenditures in rural Vietnam,
    especially among working-age population.
  27: Increased health insurance coverage and assistance to cope with drought are
    likely to limit health damages and prevent families from falling into poverty.
    Rainfall insurance schemes can provide effective protection against health costs
    of rainfall shortages.
Methodology:
  6: The paper uses panel data from 2007 to 2013 and an Instrumental Variable (IV)
    approach to quantify the effect of drought on monetary health expenditures.
  8: 'Two-part empirical analysis: 1) Regression on the determinants of falling ill
    for household members, including drought incidence, socio-demographic factors,
    and interactions. 2) Analysis of monetary costs of drought on health outcomes
    and household expenditures.'
  14: Constructs a drought severity indicator based on the cumulative total of absolute
    negative deviations in rainfall from historic averages, using 3-month rolling
    windows. This indicator is benchmarked against other drought indices.
  15: Province-specific fixed-effects are used to model the relationship between drought
    and health, accounting for differences in absolute rainfall, and the drought indicator
    is normalized between zero and one.
  17: OLS regressions with socio-demographic controls, province and survey wave fixed
    effects. Standard errors are clustered at the household-level.
  18: OLS regressions with standard errors clustered at the household level, including
    Wave and Province fixed effects. Analysis is performed across individuals and
    across four survey waves.
  20: OLS regressions with household-level clustered standard errors. The models include
    wave and province fixed effects.
  21: Household-level estimates of the reduced-form relation between subjective rice
    price valuations and drought using household survey data and province fixed effects.
  22: OLS regressions with household-level clustered standard errors, Wave-FE, and
    Province-FE. Other control variables are included as in Table 2 (not shown). Drought
    severity is measured as a 3-month average.
  24: Tobit, IV-Tobit, regressions with fixed effects (Wave-FE, Province-FE). Results
    are applicable to the specific context and time period of the data used in the
    analysis.
  25: IV-Tobit estimation is used, with the share of ill household members instrumented
    by the severity of drought. This is used to address endogeneity issues. The analysis
    uses a sample of rural households in Vietnam.
  26: Household panel data combined with local rainfall data establishes a link between
    low rainfall periods and drought-related health expenditures.
  27: IV estimations are used to assess the monetary burden on the household budget
    due to drought-related health shocks in rural Vietnam.
More Notes:
  6: The adverse effects of drought on health are more pronounced among households
    with high agricultural dependency and limited access to coping mechanisms. A government-subsidized
    health insurance scheme can reduce the adverse effects of drought on health.
  8: Focus is on the short-term consequences of drought in Vietnam. The analysis aims
    to identify who is most in need of protection by economic and social policy.
  14: The study uses district-level rainfall data matched to household survey data
    to assess drought severity. The three-month window is used because it is suitable
    for agricultural drought indices.
  16: The paper uses a hypothetical lending question to proxy the existence of an
    informal insurance network, finding that slightly more than half of the respondents
    indicate to turn to informal assistance from their social network in cases of
    hardship.
  17: The study uses variation in rainfall conditions over time and drought severity
    within provinces to explain variation in health outcomes.
  18: The effect of drought on illness, while statistically significant, is relatively
    small (2 percentage points) compared to the average illness rate of 14% in the
    sample population for a one standard deviation change in drought severity.
  20: The analysis focuses on the micro-level impacts of drought on individual health
    and rice prices, rather than directly assessing macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes. The model incorporates lagged variables to account for the time lag
    between exposure and outcomes. The 'Drought *' interaction terms indicate how
    the effect of drought varies depending on other factors.
  22: The paper uses illness as a dependent variable. It's important to note that
    illness is a proxy for vulnerability to drought and not a direct macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal outcome. The analysis also includes interaction terms between
    drought severity and various insurance and social factors, highlighting how these
    factors can moderate the impact of drought. The ethnic fractionalization index
    is based on village-level data.
  24: The page appears to be from a table presenting regression results. The dependent
    variable is related to health expenditures and independent variables are related
    to drought, demographics, income, and fixed effects. Significance levels are indicated
    by asterisks (*, **, ***). Many coefficients are negative (indicating an inverse
    relationship) or positive (indicating a positive relationship). There are no direct
    macroeconomic impacts on GDP, productivity, interest, or inflation in this excerpt
    of the paper.
  27: The study emphasizes the need for future research to focus on the transmission
    channels between drought and health to identify short-term impacts and potential
    lasting conditions.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  6: No relevant information
  7: "Drought in 2005 in Vietnam caused estimated economic damage of 110 million USD,\
    \ roughly 0.2% of the country\u2019s GDP."
  8: Health conditions and household expenditures.
  17: Individual-level health outcomes
  18: Health conditions at the household member level, specifically illness, BMI,
    BMI Shock, Weight-for-Age (WfA), and weight.
  20: Rice price and Individual illness
  21: Health vulnerability to drought-like conditions, rice prices
  22: Illness (as a proxy for vulnerability to drought)
  24: Health expenditures in parentheses (PPPUSD), Illness related expenditures
  25: No direct macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes are mentioned, but health expenditure
    is studied as a result of drought.
  27: Health and financial costs for households, particularly those vulnerable to
    poverty, are affected by drought.
Quantitative material:
  6: Drought-related health shocks can cause additional expenditures that make up
    around one fifth of what a typical household normally spends on food items.
  7: Economic damage from the 2005 drought estimated at 110 million USD, or 0.2% of
    GDP.
  16: Out-of-pocket food expenditures lie between 33 and 2162 PPP USD. Hypothetical
    lending question of 15 million Vietnamese Dong (VND) (approximately 705 USD).
    Drought severity varies between 55 and 993 mm. Two thirds of the people have access
    to some kind of health insurance, i.e., either the free health insurance program
    for the poor (57 %) or some form of private health insurance scheme (7 %).
  18: Living in the most drought-affected district increases the probability of illness
    by about nine percentage points compared to living in the least drought-affected
    district. A one standard deviation increase in drought severity (0.21) causes
    the propensity of illness to rise by two percentage points.
  20: The table presents regression coefficients and standard errors for the effects
    of drought and various demographic and economic factors on illness and rice price.
    Significance levels are indicated by asterisks (* p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01).
    Adjusted R-squared values are also provided.
  21: A one standard deviation change in drought intensity is associated with an increase
    of 0.02 PPP USD in rice prices, roughly 3 % of the mean price in the sample.
  22: Yes, coefficients and standard errors for various regression models are presented
  24: Various coefficients and standard errors are presented for regressions involving
    drought severity, health shocks, and demographic factors (age, gender, household
    size, dependency ratio) on health expenditures.
  25: Drought-related illness increases health expenditures by roughly 144 PPP USD
    for all income groups, and by roughly 90 PPP USD for the lower part of the wealth
    distribution. A change from least to most drought-affected district increases
    likelihood of illness by approximately 23 percentage points.
  27: Drought-related health shocks can pose non-negligible financial cost for many
    households vulnerable to poverty
