Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate-induced sea-level rise, particularly due to the response of the large
    ice sheets of Greenland and west Antarctica.
  3: Sea-level rise, failure of protection measures against sea-level rise.
  9: "Sea-level rise scenarios combined with temperature rise exceeding 4\xB0C and\
    \ the A1B4 socioeconomic scenario are considered drivers of risk."
  10: Sea-level rise (mean and extreme); storm surges; coastal erosion; river flooding
    (exacerbated by sea-level rise).
  12: Sea-level rise (0.5m and 2.0m by 2100), lack of adaptation measures, submergence
    and erosion.
  13: Sea-level rise (0.5 m and 2.0 m by 2100).
  14: Sea-level rise (0.5 m and 2.0 m by 2100).
  15: Sea-level rise; Extreme events (e.g., Hurricane Katrina); Lack of mitigation;
    Vulnerability to sea-level rise (exposure and low adaptive capacity)
  16: Climate-induced rise of relative sea level, with a potential rise of up to 2
    meters being not implausible; temperature rise of 4 degrees Celsius leading to
    a potential 0.5-2.0 meter rise in sea level.
Highlights:
  1: Sea-level rise could cause forced displacement of up to 187 million people and
    protection measures could cost up to 0.02% of global GDP.
  3: Protection costs in densely populated coastal areas are generally much less than
    the avoided impacts, and protection generally makes economic sense.
  9: The potential impacts of sea-level rise are significant in regions with large
    coastal populations, and adaptation scenarios range from successful protection
    to high impacts and forced retreat.
  10: Sea-level rise increases the probability of extreme water levels and flooding.  The
    number of people displaced is sensitive to the assumed threshold return level
    for flooding.
  12: Submergence is a much larger contributor to land loss than erosion; high population
    density in coastal areas exacerbates displacement; impacts are concentrated in
    Asia and small island regions; pre-existing defenses are overwhelmed by a 2.0m
    sea level rise.
  13: "East Asia, North America Atlantic, North America Paci\uFB01c, north and west\
    \ Europe and South America Atlantic are the \uFB01ve regions with the highest\
    \ costs."
  14: Without further upgrade to protection (no adaptation), sea-level rise will erode
    and flood extensive low-lying coastal areas displacing tens to millions of people
    or more by 2100. Assuming a protection response, the impact of sea-level rise
    is mainly felt in terms of increasing protection costs.
  15: Great uncertainty exists about the magnitude and sources of impacts and costs
    under high sea-level-rise scenarios; Mitigation and adaptation are more effective
    when combined; Adaptation failure cannot be ruled out.
  16: Climate-induced sea-level rise during the 21st century could be larger than
    widely reported, and a rise of up to 2 m is not implausible; there is a low-probability/high-consequence
    tail to sea-level scenarios.
Methodology:
  3: Uses the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment (DIVA) model to create
    scenarios consistent with pessimistic and optimistic views of adaptation.
  9: The DIVA model assesses biophysical and socioeconomic impacts, including adaptation
    options, using various climatic and socioeconomic scenarios.
  10: Uses the DIVA model to assess coastal impacts.  Estimates direct coastal erosion
    using the Bruun rule and indirect erosion using a simplified ASMITA model.  Evaluates
    flooding and submergence considering storm surges, astronomical tides, and river
    flooding.  Assumes no change to storm intensity or frequency.  Considers dike
    construction/upgrade as an adaptation option, using a demand for safety function
    due to lack of empirical data.  Assumes abandonment when the frequency of flooding
    is greater than 1 in 1 year.
  12: DIVA model assuming no adaptation.
  14: The study investigates the impacts and adaptation assuming a rise in sea level
    between 0.5 and 2.0 m with or without upgraded protection by 2100. The results
    are indicative and designed to provide an overview of their implications, bracketing
    the range of impacts and adaptation costs that might occur with intermediate sea-level-rise
    scenarios and partial-protection scenarios.
  15: Compares perspectives of 'pessimists' and 'optimists' on adaptation; Uses historical
    analogue studies; Considers benefit-cost approaches.
  16: Scenario-neutral analysis testing flood management systems against sea-level-rise
    scenarios without focusing on timing; analysis looking to 2200 to estimate sea
    levels.
More Notes:
  3: "The paper explores issues related to a beyond 4\xB0C world and synthesizes post-AR4\
    \ sea-level-rise scenarios to develop a potential range of rise by 2100. It develops\
    \ indicative estimates of the impacts both with and without adaptation."
  10: The analysis focuses on coastal zones and river flooding. The present storm-surge
    characteristics are displaced upwards with the rising sea level, which implies
    no change to the intensity or frequency of coastal storms or interaction between
    sea level and tidal and surge characteristics.
  12: Socioeconomic scenarios assume no coastward migration, which would amplify the
    impact potential.
  13: The analysis assumes an existing adaptation infrastructure that can be upgraded;
    if this is not the case, it is termed an 'adaptation deficit' requiring further
    investment.
  15: Vulnerability to sea-level rise is not uniform, with small islands, Africa,
    and south, southeast, and east Asia being the most vulnerable.

    per cent of global domestic product, and much higher in certain nations.

    and GDP are produced.
  12: "Land loss of 877,000\u20131,789,000 km2 for 0.5m and 2.0m sea level rise respectively,\
    \ which is approximately 0.6-1.2% of global land area; net population displaced\
    \ of 72 and 187 million people for 0.5m and 2.0m sea level rise respectively (roughly\
    \ 0.9\u20132.4% of the global population); 53-125 million people displaced from\
    \ East, Southeast, and South Asia alone; 1.2\u20132.2 million people displaced\
    \ from the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean small-island regions."
  13: Relative mix of nourishment, dike construction/upgrade and dike maintenance
    costs is 36, 39 and 25 per cent; and 13, 51 and 37 per cent for the 0.5 and 2.0
    m rise in sea level, respectively (in 2100).
