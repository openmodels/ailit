Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate-induced sea-level rise, specifically related to the response of the Greenland
    and West Antarctica ice sheets.
  2: Sea-level rise impacting coastal areas, potentially leading to submergence, flooding,
    erosion, ecosystem changes, and increased salinization.
  3: Sea-level rise is the primary driver of risk.
  4: "Sea-level rise, specifically focusing on scenarios possible in a 4\xB0C world"

  6: "The sea-level behaviour in a \u2018beyond 4\u25E6 C\u2019 world."
  7: Global sea-level rise, warmer temperatures
  10: Sea-level rise (mean and extreme), storm surges, astronomical tides, river floods
    (backwater effect)
  11: The main shock affecting outcomes is sea-level rise, up to 2 meters, increasing
    flood risk without adaptation.
  12: Sea level rise of 0.5 m and 2.0 m by 2100; Submergence and erosion

    m and a 2.0 m rise considered.
  14: Sea-level rise (0.5m to 2.0m by 2100) is the primary driver of risk.

    on protection costs and adaptation.
  17: Focuses on the potential catastrophic impacts of sea-level rise, including population
    displacement and investment in protection infrastructure.
  20: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: Sea-level rise between 0.5m and 2m by 2100 could displace up to 187 million people,
    but protection is possible, although costly, and likelihood of successful implementation
    varies by region.
  2: A large rise in sea level by 2100 could lead to major impacts, including displacement
    and economic disruption.
  3: The paper contrasts pessimistic and optimistic views on protection against sea-level
    rise. Pessimists believe protection is unaffordable and leads to large-scale displacement,
    while optimists believe protection will be widespread and successful, leading
    to diversion of investment into coastal defenses. The paper also focuses on vulnerable
    hotspots in small islands, deltas and coastal cities.
  4: IPCC AR4 models show sea-level rise due to thermal expansion and glaciers. The
    Greenland ice sheet is estimated to contribute 8 cm and Antarctica -2 cm to sea
    level rise for the A1B scenario.
  5: Sea-level rise observations are following a trajectory at the high end of the
    SRES projections made in the IPCC Third Assessment Report in 2001. Acceleration
    of ice-sheet discharge is a key mechanism that could cause sea level to increase
    significantly beyond the IPCC AR4 projected range. Pfeffer et al. [22] estimates
    should be regarded not as projections, but only as an indication of the physical
    constraint to the upper bound of global average sea-level rise.
  6: "The kinematic and palaeo-studies cited above do not provide pro jections for\
    \ the sea-level behaviour in a \u2018beyond 4\u25E6 C\u2019 world. Rather, they\
    \ provide a guide to the potential maximum rate of sea-level rise under conditions\
    \ that might be realized during the twenty-\uFB01rst century."
  7: Higher rates of sea-level rise will result from warmer temperatures.
  10: Estimates the number of people displaced due to erosion and flooding caused
    by sea-level rise.
  11: Adaptation strategies with raised dikes and beach nourishment are preferred
    to mitigate flood risk and beach damage.
  12: Submergence is a much larger contributor to land loss than erosion; High population
    density in coastal areas increases the number of people displaced; Impacts are
    concentrated in Asia; Impacts in some regions such as north and west Europe and
    the North America Atlantic Coast are much greater for a 2.0 m scenario than for
    a 0.5 m scenario, reflecting that pre-existing defenses provide benefits for a
    0.5 m rise, but are overwhelmed by a 2.0 m rise.
  13: Under scenarios with protection, the problem of environmental refugees almost
    disappears. Significant regional cost variations are noted, with East Asia, North
    American Atlantic and Pacific coasts, North and West Europe, and South American
    Atlantic being the regions with the highest costs.
  14: Without further upgrades to protection (no adaptation), sea-level rise will
    erode, flood, and submerge extensive low-lying coastal areas, potentially displacing
    tens to millions of people by 2100. With protection, the impact of sea-level rise
    is mainly felt in terms of increasing protection costs.
  15: There is significant uncertainty about the magnitude and impacts of high sea-level-rise
    scenarios; mitigation and adaptation are both necessary for managing sea-level-rise
    impacts.
  17: Sea-level rise may not necessarily result in global-scale population displacement
    if protection responses are applied; most threatened populations could be protected.

    analysis, and synthesis of different approaches.
  10: Uses the DIVA model to assess coastal erosion (direct via Bruun rule, indirect
    via a simplified ASMITA model), flooding, and displacement. Analyzes 200 largest
    tidal basins, considers beach/shore nourishment as adaptation, and evaluates river
    flooding along 115 major rivers.  Assumes storm surge characteristics are displaced
    upwards with sea-level rise, but no change to storm intensity/frequency or interaction
    between sea level and tidal/surge characteristics. Evaluates the effect of dikes.
    River flooding is evaluated in a similar fashion along 115 major rivers.

    based on population density and demand for safety, and estimates costs of adaptation
    through econometric models and expert consultations.

More Notes:
  1: The probability of sea-level rises at the high end (close to 2m) is judged to
    be very low, but of unquantifiable probability. Small islands, Africa, and parts
    of Asia are most likely to see coastal abandonment.
  4: The IPCC AR4 acknowledged limited understanding of some important effects driving
    sea level rise.
  5: The scaled-up values used by the IPCC may not fully consider the feedbacks between
    ice-sheet melting/disintegration and sea level, and hence underestimate the ice-sheet
    contribution.

Quantitative material:
  1: "Sea-level rise between 0.5 m and 2 m by 2100, for a temperature rise of 4\xB0\
    C or more. Potential forced displacement of up to 187 million people. Protection\
    \ costs up to 0.02% of global domestic product."
  4: The dotted lines on the figure represent the minimum (0.5 m) and maximum (2.0
    m) bounds considered in terms of impacts in this study.
  5: "IPCC AR4 projected upper bounds for the A1B scenario to 61 cm, and that for\
    \ A1FI to 76 cm by 2100. Observations for 1961\u20132003 are 1.8 \xB1 0.5 mm yr\u2212\
    1, for 1993\u20132003, they are 3.1 \xB1 0.7 mm yr\u22121. Model simulated sea-level\
    \ components are 1.1 \xB1 0.5 and 2.8 \xB1 0.7 mm yr\u22121, respectively. Considers\
    \ 48 cm (50 cm) as a lower range for twenty-\uFB01rst century sea-level rise in\
    \ a beyond 4\u25E6C world. An increase of up to 2 m for the twenty-first century\
    \ cannot be excluded, but a rise of 0.8 m is more likely."
  6: Kopp et al. [26] estimate that the present ice sheets could also contribute about
    0.92 m to global sea-level rise per century (with the possibility of higher rates
    for shorter periods), and this rate could be sustained for centuries.
  7: Table 1 summarizes the range of estimates for century-scale sea-level rise from
    a range of methods.
  10: Uses a 1-in-1-year flooding frequency as a threshold to define abandonment and
    estimate displaced people.
  11: Dike costs for a 2 m sea-level rise are estimated to be four times that of a
    1 m rise; 25% of the developed coastal zone may be abandoned if protection costs
    quadruple.
  12: "Land loss amounts to 877,000\u20131,789,000 km2 for a 0.5 and 2.0 m rise in\
    \ sea level, respectively (approximately 0.6\u20131.2% of the global land area).\
    \ Net population displaced is estimated at 72 and 187 million people over the\
    \ century (roughly 0.9\u20132.4% of the global population). 53\u2013125 million\
    \ people are estimated to be displaced from East, Southeast, and South Asia. 1.2\u2013\
    2.2 million people are displaced from the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific\
    \ Ocean."
  13: "The number of displaced people under no protection is outlined (millions by\
    \ 2100), while protection measures reduce displacement to minor levels of 41,000\u2013\
    305,000 people. The costs of protection (dikes and nourishment) are between US\
    \ $25 and $270 billion per annum for 0.5 and 2.0 m rises, respectively. The distribution\
    \ of costs is detailed, with dike costs dominating."
  14: Annual protection cost by coastal region in 2100, as a percentage of global
    protection investment, is presented for sea-level rises of 0.5m and 2.0m (Figure
    4). The paper also notes that sea-level rise could displace tens to millions of
    people or more by 2100 without further protection.
