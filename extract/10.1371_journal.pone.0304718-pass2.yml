Drivers of Risk:
  2: The paper examines the impact of future climate and ocean productivity projections,
    specifically thermal and sea ice conditions, primary productivity fluctuations,
    and redistribution of marine biodiversity.
  3: Changes in SST, Sea Ice Concentration (SIC), sea bottom temperatures, and primary
    production are modeled based on CMIP6 GCMs under different SSPs.
  4: Climate layers (WSIC, WSST, WSBT, and SSBT), SNPP (likely sea surface net primary
    productivity), and bathymetry.
  5: Combined fluctuations in future climate and primary productivity
  6: The analysis assumes potential changes in subsidies to fishing sectors and global
    fuel prices that can increase fishing costs, and changes in global supply through
    aquaculture and demand for seafood impacting future prices and welfare.
  8: Drivers of risk include changes in physical and biogeochemical variables, particularly
    warming sea temperatures (winter sea bottom and surface), loss of winter sea ice,
    and changes in primary production.
  10: Climate change scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585) impacting the abundance-weighted
    center of gravity of commercial fish species.
  12: Climate scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585).
  13: The drivers of risk are changes in cumulative maximum catch potential (MCP)
    under different SSPs, which are influenced by factors impacting species abundance
    and distribution.
  14: The primary driver of risk is future climate change, specifically examining
    different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).
  15: Future climate change, extreme warming, sea ice loss
  17: Climate changes are driving shifts in fish stock distributions, changes in sea
    ice and cold pool extent, and poleward shifts of warm-adapted taxa.
  18: Climate-driven changes in species abundance are the primary driver of risk considered.
    Also, warming, sea ice loss, and ocean net primary production.
  19: This paper likely addresses climate change impacts on fisheries, given the focus
    on future redistribution of fishery resources.

Highlights:
  2: Climate change has resulted in ecological surprises such as the recent collapse
    of valuable fisheries resources (e.g., snow crab and Pacific cod), resulting in
    significant loss of livelihoods and revenue streams.
  4: Machine learning algorithms outperform conventional regression models in predicting
    species distribution and abundance.
  5: Changes in projected abundances (2021-2100) reflect changes in fish biomass.
  8: There is an increasing overlap in areas of peak abundance within the present-day
    fishing grounds in both US and Russian waters.
  10: Visualization of the projected paths and directional shifts of species distributions
    across the Bering Sea under different climate scenarios, indicating potential
    future changes in fish distribution.
  12: Projected changes in cumulative maximum catch potential (MCP) were lowest under
    SSP126, moderate under SSP245 and SSP370, and highest under SSP585.
  13: Future redistribution of fishery resources will lead to biological and economic
    trade-offs. There are differences in abundance trends with distance away from
    major landing ports in the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS).
  14: Under most scenarios, MRP and MPP are projected to decline. MCP may initially
    increase in some scenarios/time periods, but generally decreases over time. Declines
    in MCP, MRP, and MPP are greater in Russian waters than in US fishing grounds.
  15: Projected increases in MCP in the NEBS and Chukchi Sea under extreme warming
    do not necessarily translate to significant increases in MRP and MPP, changes
    in catch composition can alter the potential economic benefits from fisheries,
    shifts in marine resources largely influence revenue and profit potential
  17: Shifting marine fisheries resources between the US and Russian EEZs raises governance
    and management issues for transboundary fish stocks and elevated risks of fisheries
    conflicts. Projected decreases in walleye pollock and Pacific cod in the US EEZ
    are likely to affect commercial landings as abundance shifts to the Russian EEZ.
    Enhanced geographical overlap in species distributional ranges could lead to ecological
    competition and overfishing.
  18: Well-managed marine ecosystems like the EBS can experience limited economic
    impact in the near-term (2021-2040) under low to moderate levels of climatic changes.
    Mitigation and conservation efforts may be needed under more extreme conditions.
    Climate-smart solutions are needed to manage and conserve fisheries resources
    to support food and nutritional security.
  21: Improved fisheries management could offset many negative effects of climate
    change (from citation 58)
Methodology:
  2: The paper uses a bioeconomic model analysis to assess species-specific abundance
    changes of major fisheries resources in the Pacific Arctic. The climate projections
    used are from the state-of-the-art climate models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison
    Project 6 (CMIP6).
  3: "Present-day climate data (2000-2019) from online repositories, including AVHRR-OI\
    \ SST and SIC data from NOAA NCEI, and sea bottom temperatures and primary production\
    \ from CMEMS are used. Future climate layers are calculated from corresponding\
    \ monthly averages of four down-scaled CMIP6 GCMs (CESM2-WACCM, CNRM-ESM2-1, IPSL-CM6ALR,\
    \ and MPI-ESM1.2HR) under SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585 scenarios. The delta\
    \ method is implemented for spatial data down-scaling of future climate layers\
    \ by computing the pixel-wise difference between historical present (2000\u2013\
    2014) and future (2021\u20132100) coarsely-resolved values."
  4: Species abundance data from NOAA Fisheries and the Arctic ecosystem integrated
    survey were used to develop two machine-learning models (random forest, RF; and
    boosted regression trees, BRT) to predict present and projected future patterns
    of species abundance.
  5: Species abundance was predicted using RF and BRT models for future time periods
    (2061-2080, 2081-2100) under different SSPs (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585).
  6: The analysis uses species-specific population growth rates and estimated species
    abundance from ensemble models to compute MCP and assesses economic impacts by
    maintaining constant prices and costs, with results applicable from the present
    day (2000-2019) to future periods (2021-2100).
  8: "The analysis uses species distribution models based on environmental variables\
    \ (depth, bottom temperatures, summer net primary production) to project future\
    \ species abundance and distribution, focusing on the Bering Sea. Present-day\
    \ fishing grounds were identified as pixels of high aggregated fishing effort\
    \ (\u2265 1000 fishing hrs) using annually aggregated fishing effort data from\
    \ 2012 to 2020 from the global fishing watch online repository"
  10: Modeled abundance used to compute taxon-specific COGs throughout the Bering
    Sea basin, separated by land masses. Trajectories mapped on land for species with
    abundances close to the coasts.
  12: "Spatial abundance distributions were analyzed for present (2000\u20132019)\
    \ and future (2041\u20132060; 2081\u20132100) periods under the SSP585 scenario."
  13: The analysis uses models to predict future MCP under different SSPs and compares
    the results relative to the present (2000-2019). The results are applicable to
    the time periods 2041-2060 and 2081-2100. The study also considers distances from
    major landing ports.
  14: The analysis uses modeling to project changes in MCP, MRP, and MPP based on
    different climate scenarios. The results are applicable to the study area, with
    specific mentions of US fishing grounds, Russian waters, the Eastern Bering Sea
    (EBS), and Chukchi Sea.
  15: "Bioeconomic analyses applied to spatio-temporal projections of species abundance,\
    \ considering SSP126 and SSP585 scenarios;  analysis considers distances from\
    \ major fishing ports like Dutch Harbor and Port of Nome, using 100-km buffer\
    \ zones for present (2000\u20132019) and future (2021\u20132100) periods"
  17: The analysis uses scenario-based projections of climate changes to assess potential
    availability of commercially exploited fisheries in the EBS and Chukchi Sea, using
    taxon-specific abundance projections from machine learning models. Biological
    estimates for present and future periods are computed using published species-specific
    biological parameters for US BSAI species stocks. Results are applicable for devising
    climate-ready adaptation and conservation measures.
  18: The economic analysis is intended as a simple first-cut attempt, using ex-vessel
    prices and fishing costs based on published regional values. The analysis assumes
    constant economic parameters over time.
  19: The paper involves data curation, formal analysis, methodology development,
    resource utilization, supervision, validation, visualization, and writing by the
    listed authors.
  21: Uses machine learning techniques for global models and predictions of plant
    diversity (from citation 43). Mentions boosted regression trees (citations 46,
    47, and 52), random forests (citation 44), and species distribution models (citations
    48, 49, and 50).
More Notes:
  4: The analysis uses data from 2000-2019 for present-day conditions and projects
    into the future periods 2021-2040 and 2041-2060.
  5: Analysis assumes conservatively managed fisheries and constant species-specific
    biological parameters based on historical averages.
  8: The study uses SSP585 as an extreme shared socio-economic pathway scenario.
  10: The Bering Sea is divided into the Northern Bering Sea (NBS) and Southeastern
    Bering Sea (SEBS). Some trajectories are mapped on land because the calculations
    for COGs are throughout the basin and some species have a center of gravity close
    to the coasts.
  12: Changes in maximum catch, revenue, and profit potential show a tendency to increase
    with scenario severity and longer projected time horizons.
  13: The study specifically focuses on eight major fisheries. The US-Russia EEZ boundary
    is considered. The study mentions changes in low-catch and high-economic value
    species such as snow crab and Greenland halibut.
  14: The study contrasts low (SSP126) and high (SSP585) future climate scenarios,
    showing significant and steep declines in MRPs and MPPs in the latter. Fluctuations
    in abundance of target species increased with the degree of future climate change.
  15: The study reveals divergent patterns of future MCPs relative to the present,
    impacting future fishing fleet mobility.
  17: The analysis recognizes uncertainties from simple biological and economic assumptions
    and the limited subset of fisheries included.
  18: The paper acknowledges limitations related to projecting biological parameters
    into the future, the dynamic nature of economic parameters, and uncertainties
    in Earth System Model projections of species distributions, abundance, and ocean
    net primary production (NPP).
Quantitative material:

    \ and (d) SSP585 relative to the present (2000\u20132019). Small abundance decline\
    \ translated to drops in MRP and MPP by about 37% and 47%, respectively. MCP peaks\
    \ were observed at 400 km away from Dutch harbor."
  14: "The table provides percentage changes in MCP, MRP, and MPP relative to present\
    \ (2000\u20132019) across different time periods (2021\u20132040, 2041\u20132060,\
    \ 2061\u20132080, 2081\u20132100) under SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585 scenarios."
