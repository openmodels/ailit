Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (warming, sea ice concentration, net primary production) and socio-economic
    pathways (SSPs).
  5: Changes in fish biomass in response to combined fluctuations in future climate
    and primary productivity, biotic interactions (e.g., competition and predation
    pressure), and diseases.
  7: Future redistribution of fishery resources suggests biological and economic trade-offs.
  9: Future climate change impacts on sea bottom temperature, sea surface temperature,
    sea ice concentration, and net primary production under the SSP585 scenario (high
    greenhouse gas emissions trajectory).
  12: Climate change impacts on spatial distribution and abundance of different fish
    species, specifically under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).
  13: Future redistribution of fishery resources due to climate change, specifically
    under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).
  14: Climate change, specifically warming levels and shifting species distributions
    due to climate scenarios (SSPs).
  17: Climate change leading to redistribution of fishery resources, increases in
    the marginal cost of production (MCP) in the Northeast Bering Sea (NEBS) and Chukchi
    Sea, shifting marine fisheries resources between US and Russian Exclusive Economic
    Zones (EEZ), movement of fish stocks out of traditional fishing grounds, declines
    in winter sea ice, increased predation intensity, changes in abundance and distribution
    of warm-adapted taxa, potential reorganization of marine communities.
  18: Climate change impacts on species distribution and abundance, particularly warming
    and sea ice loss. Uncertainty in ocean net primary production (NPP) projections
    from Earth System Models (CMIP6).
  19: Climate change impacts on fisheries and aquaculture.
Highlights:
  1: Future redistribution of fishery resources suggests biological and economic trade-offs
    according to the severity of the emission scenario; abundance and distribution
    changes differ across species, time periods, and climate scenarios; under SSP585,
    Pacific cod abundances increased and snow crab abundances decreased with concurrent
    zonal and meridional future shifts in their centers of gravity; fishing at the
    same distance from Dutch Harbor could yield declining catches for highly valuable
    fisheries under SSP585; changes in abundance and shifting distributions could
    have important biological and economic impacts.
  7: The analysis suggests that findings are robust to different assumptions on prices
    and costs over time.
  9: Future changes in oceanographic variables (temperature, sea ice, primary production)
    are projected, indicating potential redistribution of fishery resources and associated
    economic trade-offs.
  12: Future redistribution of fishery resources suggests biological and economic
    trade-offs. Projected changes in MCP were lowest under SSP126, moderate under
    SSP245 and SSP370, and highest under SSP585. Significant MCP increases in the
    Chukchi Sea were accounted for by increases in the abundance of high catch and
    low economic value taxa.
  13: Climate change is predicted to cause a redistribution of fishery resources,
    leading to both biological and economic trade-offs. Different SSP scenarios show
    varying patterns of change in MCP. For example, under SSP585, MCP peaks are observed
    further from Dutch Harbor, with declines in magnitude between 2041 and 2100, while
    MCPs are generally higher than present-day near the Port of Nome under both SSP126
    and SSP585.
  14: Significant and steep declines in MRPs and MPPs are projected under higher climate
    change scenarios (e.g., SSP585), even when MCP shows slight increases due to species
    redistribution. Russian waters are projected to exhibit higher declines compared
    to US fishing grounds under specific scenarios.
  17: Future redistribution of fishery resources suggests biological and economic
    trade-offs, with potential increases in Marine Protected Resources (MRPs) close
    to the major Arctic port. This shift could lead to governance issues, fisheries
    conflicts, and ecological changes.
  18: Well-managed marine ecosystems may experience limited economic impact in the
    near-term (2021-2040) under low to moderate levels of climatic changes. Mitigation
    and conservation efforts may be needed under extreme warming conditions.
Methodology:
  1: Projection of future changes in abundance and distribution of fish and crab species
    under different climate scenarios (CMIP6 SSPs).
  5: "The study uses ensemble model predictions/projections under four alternative\
    \ shared socio-economic pathways (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585) for two\
    \ future time periods (2061\u20132080, and 2081\u20132100). It estimates maximum\
    \ sustainable yield (MSY) using model outputs of species-specific abundance within\
    \ the US exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS)."
  7: 'Conducted sensitivity analysis under three scenarios: increasing costs, increasing
    prices, and both increasing costs and prices, using bioeconomic variables and
    Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).'
  9: Spatial distribution modelling of oceanographic variables under the SSP585 scenario
    for different time periods (2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2061-2080, and 2081-2100) compared
    to a present-day baseline (2000-2019).
  12: Spatial abundance distribution models were used for present (2000-2019) and
    future (2041-2060; 2081-2100) periods under SSP585. The analysis considered changes
    in cumulative maximum catch potential (MCP) between present and future periods.
  13: Modeling of MCP under different SSP scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585)
    for two future time periods (2041-2060 and 2081-2100), compared to a baseline
    (2000-2019). Analysis of MCP relative to major landing ports in the EBS (Eastern
    Bering Sea).
  14: The study uses modeling to project future changes in MCP, MRP, and MPP based
    on different climate scenarios (SSPs) and time periods.
  17: Scenario-based projections of climate changes in the potential availability
    of commercially-exploited fisheries in the EBS and Chukchi Sea using taxon-specific
    abundance projections. Machine learning models were used to derive biological
    estimates of fishable biomass, but the method likely does not represent actual
    standing stock biomass.
  18: Economic analysis using ex-vessel prices and fishing costs to evaluate potential
    impacts of climate-driven species abundance changes. Analysis applicable to future
    time periods under future climate and shared socioeconomic pathways.
  19: Formal analysis conducted by Irene D. Alabia.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the eastern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea; results are specific
    to eight commercially important fish and crab species; the study considers the
    impact on fisheries specifically, not national-level macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    impacts directly.
  5: "The analysis assumes predicted present-day species abundances (2000\u20132019)\
    \ are at their carrying capacity and relies on constant species-specific biological\
    \ parameters from long-term averages of historical reference based on the RAM\
    \ Legacy Stock Assessment Database version 2.95."
  9: The paper utilizes the SSP585 scenario, representing a high greenhouse gas emissions
    trajectory. The figures show projected changes along a particular coastal region.
    Hatched areas on maps indicate areas of higher uncertainty in projections.
  12: The US-Russia EEZ boundary impacts the interpretation of spatial changes in
    fisheries. The study focuses on eight fisheries.
  13: The US-Russia EEZ boundary impacts the distribution of catch, revenue, and profit
    potential.
  17: The analysis acknowledges uncertainties from simplified biological and economic
    assumptions and a limited subset of commercial fisheries included. Multi-species
    interactions could lead to less overlap in Centers of Gravity (COGs) than anticipated
    by single-species models.
  18: The analysis assumes constant economic parameters (ex-vessel prices and fishing
    costs) over time, which is a limitation. There are uncertainties in model projections
    of species distributions and abundance due to structural uncertainties in Earth
    System Models.
  19: The paper focuses on the future redistribution of fishery resources, likely
    due to climate change, and identifies potential biological and economic trade-offs.
    The reference list includes publications discussing the impact of climate change
    on fisheries, food security, and related topics.
