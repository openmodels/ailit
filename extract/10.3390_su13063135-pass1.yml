Drivers of Risk:
  2: Natural disasters, climate change, commodity price changes, and uncertain donor
    grants.
  3: Natural disasters (storms, earthquakes, volcanic activity, floods, droughts,
    and landslides); Climate change; Commodity price fluctuations; Uncertain donor
    grants; Terms-of-trade shocks; Revenue volatility; Lack of timely macroeconomic
    data
  4: Natural disasters; Climate change shocks; Revenue volatility
  5: Natural disasters/climate change, external borrowing constraints, inadequate
    reserves, permanent shocks (e.g. climate change), changes in long-term interest
    rates, changes in fiscal regimes (e.g. new resource projects, fishing agreements).
  8: Natural disasters are seen as temporary shocks, while climate change is considered
    a permanent shock affecting debt dynamics.
  10: Debt financing and terms of trade fluctuations affect the primary balance and
    debt-to-GDP ratio.
  11: Small insular economies are vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change.
  12: Natural disaster shocks and their impact on government budgets.
  13: Natural disasters are factored into the debt sustainability dynamics.
  14: Natural disasters, climate change shocks (permanent)
  15: Unexpected permanent natural disaster shock or climate change shock, sea level
    rise, changes in the government's preference for covering disaster losses
  16: Natural disasters/Climate Change Shocks
  17: Shocks moving the debt/GDP ratio away from target.
  19: Natural disaster shocks to GDP and volatility of resource revenue are impacting
    fiscal outcomes.
  20: Natural disasters; Increases in public sector wages; Increases in use of goods
    and services by government.
  21: "Resource revenue shocks; Natural disaster shocks (specifically the fiscal cost\
    \ of disasters, sn); Nominal GDP growth rate (\U0001D6FE)"
  22: Volatile resource revenue; Reliance on renewable resources (fishing, logging);
    Climate change is an implicit driver of risk, which is impacting renewable resource
    revenue streams, but not explicitly stated.
  23: Shocks from natural disasters and economic disruptions impacting fishing and
    tourism revenues in small island economies.
  24: Unexpected massive natural disasters.
  25: Unexpected permanent climate change shocks, natural disasters, volatile resource
    revenues, uncertain foreign grants.
Drivers_of_Risk:
  18: Volatility in GDP and revenue is a risk to achieving budget balance targets,
    especially in more volatile economies like PNG.
Highlights:
  2: Advantages of a recurrent expenditure rule based on non-resource and non-grant
    revenue, interdependently determined by government debt and budget balance targets
    with expected disaster shocks. The proposed rule-based fiscal policy framework
    is practically applicable for many developing countries facing increasing frequency
    and impact of devastating natural hazards and climatic change.
  3: Permanent natural disaster shocks or climate change affect the sustainable, steady-state
    debt-to-GDP ratio; Pacific Islands experience higher macroeconomic volatility
    because of less economic diversification; Default fiscal framework in many disaster-prone
    states is procyclical since they have de-facto balanced budget rule under limited
    borrowing capacity
  4: A recurrent expenditure rule allows government expenditure required for recovery
    of damages by disasters, does not require potential GDP growth rates difficult
    to estimate for small islands, and is free from a prerequisite for expenditure
    growth rule; Fiscal rules reduce procyclicality of economy and maintain fiscal
    sustainability while meeting infrastructure needs; A debt rule critically maintains
    long-run fiscal sustainability.
  5: Investment-friendly rules are important for the Pacific Islands because of large
    infrastructure needs amplified by natural disasters/climate change; Expenditure
    rules are effective for macroeconomic stabilization; Operational simplicity is
    preferable when designing fiscal rules for the Pacific Islands, given their institutional
    capacity.
  8: The paper proposes different fiscal rules and targets to manage the effects of
    natural disasters and climate change on national fiscal policy.
  10: Primary balance is maximized at a 28 percent debt-to-GDP ratio for Pacific Islands,
    slightly lower than the 30 percent typical for emerging market economies.
  12: The impact of natural disaster shocks on fiscal budget, debt dynamics when real
    interest rate exceeds growth rate.
  13: The steady-state debt level for PNG is around 30% in this exercise.
  14: The impact of disasters on economic growth and the risk premium is ambiguous.
    The result is sensitive to parameters and it is not easy to know true steady-state
    values. The exercise presented in this paper should be treated as an illustration
    rather than true values for PNG.
  15: Natural disasters can have ambiguous effects on growth and interest rates in
    the steady state. A positive technology shock that results from reconstruction
    after a natural disaster can actually increase steady-state debt levels while
    a climate change shock that negatively effects economic activity can reduce the
    steady-state debt level. The debt target should be reconsidered or revised if
    there is an unexpected permanent shift in the probability of natural disasters.
  16: Natural disasters/climate change shocks can shift equilibrium debt from dt to
    dt*, depending on whether they lower or raise the ratio of (1 + interest rate)
    / (1 + growth rate). Recommends using the headline budget balance as an anchor
    when formulating budget balance targets in the Pacific Islands.
  17: Having an expenditure rule is more important than a revenue rule to reduce the
    procyclicality of the economy.
  18: PNG faces high volatility in GDP and revenue, suggesting a need for expenditure
    rules that account for non-volatile revenue for stability.
  19: Defining expenditure rules based on stable revenue rather than GDP can reduce
    fiscal volatility and is operationally feasible for small fragile states.
  20: Investment-friendly expenditure rules like recurrent spending as a percentage
    of stable revenue are useful for stabilization in Pacific Island countries, as
    they allow for infrastructure rebuilding after disasters.
  21: A natural disaster-resilient fiscal rule can guide fiscal policy in response
    to natural disasters, suggesting the magnitude of fiscal stimulus needed. The
    rule allows deviation from budget balance targets to accommodate disaster costs
    and volatile resource revenues. A recurrent spending rule is used to constrain
    other items in the budget.
  22: Revenue appropriation strategy depends on specific characteristics of the economy;
    Volatile resource revenue should be excluded from fiscal rules to avoid procyclicality;
    Non-resource primary balance as a percentage of non-resource GDP can be a fiscal
    target for smoothing resource earnings and promoting intergenerational equity.
  23: Establishment of stabilization funds and cash buffers as fiscal strategies to
    manage volatility in revenue and expenditures due to natural disasters.
  24: Fiscal rules should incorporate the expected impact of natural disasters and
    climate change on fiscal balances. Escape clauses can be used in the event of
    unexpected disasters, but should be clearly defined and carefully applied. A forward-looking
    explanation mechanism is suggested to increase credibility after triggering an
    escape clause.
  25: A recurrent expenditure rule may be the most useful fiscal rule in the Pacific
    Islands as a countercyclical policy tool to handle natural disasters, volatile
    resource revenues, and uncertain foreign grants, together with the debt target,
    which is linked to the budget balance target.
Methodology:
  2: Studies how natural disasters and climate change affect long-term debt dynamics
    and proposes cutting-edge fiscal policy rules. A recurrent expenditure rule based
    on non-resource and non-grant revenue, interdependently determined by government
    debt and budget balance targets with expected disaster shocks, is proposed.
  3: Develops an analytical framework for a rule-based fiscal policy to ensure fiscal
    sustainability and economic stability in countries most prone to natural disasters,
    with a focus on Pacific Islands; Proposes a recurrent expenditure rule interdependently
    determined by government debt and budget balance targets, incorporating probabilistic
    disaster shocks; Defines a recurrent expenditure rule robust to natural disasters,
    commodity price fluctuations, and uncertain grant revenues
  4: Analyze fiscal rules in small islands prone to natural disasters; Observe the
    debt-to-GDP ratio maximizing the primary balance; Calibrate a debt-to-GDP target
    in the event of natural disasters; Study the impact of unexpected climate change
    shocks on debt sustainability; Connect the debt target with probabilistic natural
    disaster shocks to fiscal balance, expenditure, and revenues; Recommend a recurrent
    expenditure rule.
  5: Discussion of the pros and cons of different fiscal rules (debt rules, budget
    balance rules, expenditure rules, and revenue rules) for achieving fiscal sustainability
    and macroeconomic stabilization.
  8: The analysis uses empirical and normative approaches to evaluate debt targets
    and explores fiscal rules in terms of debt, budget balance, expenditure, revenue,
    and cash buffer.
  10: The analysis uses a fiscal reaction function with lagged dependent variable
    and quadratic and linear terms of debt-to-GDP ratio; robustness check includes
    a commodity terms of trade index.
  11: The analysis incorporates a natural disaster shock into the debt sustainability
    framework for small islands.
  12: Budget balance examined through a series of equations reflecting revenue and
    expenditure with and without natural disasters, and steady-state analysis of debt
    dynamics.
  13: Primary balance is considered a choice variable for adjusting steady-state debt
    levels.
  14: Steady-state analysis to analyze the effects of permanent natural disasters
    or climate change shocks on debt dynamics.
  15: 'The paper considers two cases: one where natural disasters lead to positive
    technological shocks and another where climate change dampens economic activity
    permanently. These cases are used to analyze the impact on the steady-state debt
    level.'
  16: The analysis uses a debt equation, relating current debt to past debt and the
    budget balance. It considers the impact of natural disasters on the relationship
    between interest rates and growth rates and then explores the implications for
    equilibrium debt levels.
  17: The paper uses equations to model the budget balance and fiscal adjustment,
    including a linear adjustment rule; the fiscal adjustment rule is intended to
    bring the budget balance to target over a period of lambda years; steady-state
    analysis; exclusion of the impact of construction of massive LNG facility when
    calibrating the steady-state nominal growth rate.
  18: Expenditure rules are derived from budget balance targets and analyzed through
    standard deviations to assess volatility in Pacific Island economies.
  20: Derivation of recurrent expenditure rule equations based on government cash-flow
    constraint and steady-state budget balance. Applicable to Pacific Island countries.
  21: Development of a 'natural disaster-resilient fiscal rule' using equations (6),
    (9), and (14). The rule suggests a fiscal stimulus at the margin in response to
    natural disasters. It's based on a recurrent expenditure rule and a cash-flow
    constraint. The applicability is shown through an illustrative example using the
    2018 PNG earthquake.
  22: Calibration of the permanent income hypothesis to determine optimal non-resource
    primary balance. Applicable to commodity exporters, especially those reliant on
    non-renewable resources. The exclusion of volatile resource revenue from fiscal
    rules is mentioned.
  24: Proposes a fiscal policy framework that includes the expected impact of shocks
    on fiscal balances, specifically for small islands vulnerable to natural disasters,
    climate change, commodity price fluctuations, and foreign aid, using Pacific Island
    countries as an example. Suggests a forward-looking explanation mechanism similar
    to inflation targeting regimes, where fiscal authorities provide a future fiscal
    path explaining how targets will be met after a disaster.
  25: Theoretical framework to calibrate debt and budget balance targets and expenditure
    rules; Fiscal rule framework based on permanent income hypothesis; Application
    of a recurrent expenditure rule as a countercyclical policy tool.
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on small states and developing countries.
  3: Remittances are equally important financial flows to mitigate the impact of natural
    disasters; Fiscal balance positively correlates with output in developing countries
    and 65 percent of them show a procyclical fiscal policy
  4: The paper provides an application of these rules to PNG.
  14: "Uses values consistent with IMF\u2019s debt sustainability analysis and macro\
    \ framework at the end of the projection period. The magnitude of disaster shocks\
    \ should be the effect on budget balance (\U0001D460\U0001D461\U0001D45B\U0001D461\
    ), but the 0.2 percent shock used here is the effect on GDP assuming that the\
    \ government can offset the adverse impact on the economy in the steady state\
    \ (\U0001D460 = 1)."
  15: The paper simplifies the impact of technological shocks from reconstruction
    by treating a potentially long but temporary effect on total factor productivity
    as permanent. The government needs to consider disaster recovery efforts made
    by the private sector and local communities when deciding how much of the disaster
    loss to cover.
  16: The paper focuses on small states which typically do not have well-defined economic
    cycles making it difficult to define the structural budget balance.
  17: The value of the budget deficit target is presented as an illustration rather
    than the recommended value; the steady-state growth rate is not affected by countercyclical
    fiscal policy.
  19: Expenditure ceilings on categories like personnel costs can aid budget management
    in countries with limited financial management capacity.
  20: Foreign aid for disaster relief often has time lags and may not enter the budget.
    Public financial management systems need to be strengthened to implement expenditure
    controls. Public investment financed by grants will not affect the debt target.
  21: The fiscal rule implies that public investment can be automatically determined
    by the realized value of natural disaster shocks. The illustrative example for
    the 2018 PNG earthquake is simplified and excludes other items on the budget.
  22: The permanent income hypothesis is useful for commodity exporters. Fishing license
    fees and logging revenues are identified as volatile resource revenue items for
    several Pacific Island countries.
  24: The paper focuses on fiscal rules and mechanisms, particularly escape clauses,
    in the context of natural disasters and climate change, especially relevant for
    small island states. The proposed forward-looking explanation is similar to inflation
    targeting used by central banks.
  25: The paper uses PNG as an example due to its characteristics as a commodity exporter
    reliant on grants and prone to natural disasters and climatic shocks, and data
    availability. The authors suggest applying similar analytical methods to other
    Pacific, Caribbean, or Indian Ocean countries.
