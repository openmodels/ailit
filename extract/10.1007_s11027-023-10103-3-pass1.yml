Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change adds to adaptation constraints and limits.
  6: Climatic effects are treated as the independent variable affecting determinants
    of adaptive capacity.
  8: Increased frequency and distribution of diseases, heat, and extreme weather events.
  10: Prolonged periods of drought and high temperatures; Climate change negatively
    affecting micro- and macronutrient content of foods; Damages to critical infrastructure
    hindering access to water, sanitation, and hygiene services; Sewage overflow following
    heavy rainfall; Spread of diseases, particularly heat-related risks in Asia and
    Africa.
  13: Climate change negatively affecting adaptive capacity, differing levels of adaptive
    capacity across regions, differing exposure to climate hazards across regions
    (e.g., Small Island States)
Highlights:
  2: Assumed levels of future adaptive capacity should be constrained in assessments
    of sectoral climate risks, and proposes avenues for doing so.
  8: Climatic impacts have significant economic costs and damages, and effects on
    GDP and municipal budgets.
  13: Adaptive capacity can be negatively affected by climate change itself. Assumptions
    of adaptive capacity in assessments ought to be tested against available literature
    on relevant climate impacts.
Methodology:
  2: Review of literature on human impacts of climate change through the lens of adaptive
    capacity, building on IPCC AR6 WG2 report evidence on impacts on financial resources
    and complemented by analysis of climatic risks to human resources.
  6: Uses keywords to screen the regional and sectoral chapters of the AR6 WG2 report,
    qualitatively treating the keywords and descriptions as the dependent variable,
    and climatic effects as the independent variable.
  8: Observational case studies mentioned but specific methodology details are not
    visible.
  13: Review of literature on climate impacts to test assumptions of adaptive capacity;
    consistency check for plausibility of adaptive capacity assumptions.
More Notes:
  2: The paper argues for more realistic assessments of sectoral climate risks by
    constraining assumed levels of future adaptive capacity in expert judgment-based
    assessments.
  4: This page focuses on the concept of adaptive capacity and its dynamic nature,
    but it does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes of climate
    change adaptation at a national level. It discusses the limitations of current
    assessments in incorporating the dynamic nature of adaptive capacity when estimating
    the potential for adaptation to reduce risks.
  10: The paper notes a research gap concerning the human impacts of climate change
    in Central and South America.
  13: The paper proposes a framework for reflecting more plausible levels of adaptive
    capacity in climate risk assessments based on expert judgment. It emphasizes the
    need for interdisciplinary expert exchange and qualitative checks for consistency
    with available literature.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Adaptive capacity determines whether adaptation reduces risks; climate change
    impacts financial resources.
  6: Focuses on human and financial resources as necessary though not sufficient conditions
    for adaptation. Mentions climate vulnerability increases the cost of debt.
  8: Observations on economic impacts such as GDP effects and wider economic impact
    from climate-induced changes discussed.
  10: Reduced labour capacity and cognitive functioning leading to affected economic
    activity; Negative long-term earning effects of reduced educational attainment;
    Risks undermining adaptive capacity by placing additional burden on governance
    structures and budgets.
  13: Adaptive capacity, residual risk after adaptation
Quantitative material:
  8: None.
