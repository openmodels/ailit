Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate-related natural disasters (flash floods, surges, cyclones, severe storms)
  2: Climate-related natural disasters include sudden shocks like flash floods, surges,
    cyclones, blizzards, and severe storms.
  4: Climate-related natural disasters, such as floods, storms, and cyclones, impact
    economic growth by disrupting production inputs and damaging infrastructure.
  5: Large disasters (> 10,000 affected), population affected by disasters (%), affected
    by floods (%), affected by storms (%), openness of economy (%), real investment
    share of GDP (%), real government share of GDP (%), FDI inflow relative to GDP
    (%), FDI outflow relative to GDP (%), inflation, population size (,000), democracy

  6: Climate-related disasters (floods and storms from EM-DAT)
  7: Natural disasters (floods and storms specifically mentioned)
  8: Climate-related disasters (specifically, the sum of the population affected by
    disasters)
  9: Population affected by floods, storms, and other climatic disasters.
  11: Number of people affected by climatic disasters
  13: Conflict onset, conflict incidence
  14: Sudden climatic disasters like storms and floods adversely affect people and
    production inputs such as land, infrastructure, and factories.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change is an economic concern for countries susceptible to climate-related
    natural disasters; however, climate-related disasters will not lead to more armed
    conflicts through their effects on GDP growth.
  2: Climate-related disasters have a negative impact on economic growth, but do not
    have any direct effect on conflict onset.
  4: The negative impact of climate-related disasters on economic growth and the potential
    link between negative economic shocks and increased risk of armed conflict onset.
  5: Climate-related events as defined in the article serve as exogenous events in
    their second-stage analysis.
  6: Examines the impact of climate-related disasters on conflict.
  7: Floods and storms are very similar in terms of population affected. Disasters,
    on a global scale, are distributed equally over the year.
  8: Climate-related disasters have a negative and statistically significant effect
    on per capita economic growth.
  9: An increase in population affected by one disaster leads to a strong negative
    impact on economic growth.
  11: Climatic disasters have a statistically significant and robust negative causal
    effect on short-run economic growth.
  13: Conflict onset and incidence have statistically significant negative impacts
    on GDP/capita growth.
  14: Short-term negative effects of climate-induced disasters on economic growth
    do not increase the risk of armed civil conflict.
Methodology:
  1: Econometric methods are used to study the consequences of climate-induced natural
    disasters on economic growth.
  2: The analysis uses ordinary least squares (OLS) and fixed-effects methods in panel
    data to study the impact of climate-related disasters on economic growth and conflict
    onset.
  4: The paper employs fixed-effects models to study the relationship between climate-related
    events and economic growth, then examines the effect on armed conflict onset.
  5: Panel dataset covering 1980-2007 for 171 countries. Uses country fixed effects.
    Uses climate-related events as exogenous events in second-stage analysis. The
    dependent variable in the growth analysis is real GDP per capita growth rate.
  6: Uses disaster data from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT). The size of an
    event is normalized by dividing the size of the affected population.
  7: The paper uses a model of economic growth to assess the impact of natural disasters.
    Control variables are lagged by one year to minimize reversed causality. They
    also weight events by how long into the year they occur (events in January have
    a larger weight than events in December).
  8: Regression models with country fixed-effects and fixed-year dummies are used
    to estimate the effects of climate-related disasters on per capita economic growth.
    The model includes lagged economic growth, openness to foreign trade, investment,
    government expenditure, FDI, and inflation as control variables. Applicable to
    countries with available data and similar characteristics.
  9: Fixed-effects estimator model using STATA 11, with year and country fixed effects
    included in the analysis.
  11: Instrumental variable analysis with a two-stage least squares approach; the
    first stage models economic growth as a function of climatic disasters, and the
    second stage models conflict onset as a function of instrumented income growth.
    Includes country and time fixed effects.
  13: Regression analysis with instrumental variables and fixed effects. Models include
    country-specific cubic splines, time trends, and controls for floods and storms.
    Robustness tests are performed with clustered standard errors.
  14: "Analysis is done using 2SLS models for the period 1980\u20132007, with robustness\
    \ checks involving several alternative model specifications."
More Notes:
  2: Instrumenting economic growth with climatic disasters allows for imposing exogenous
    variation in growth, though no indirect effect on conflict onset via economic
    growth was found.
  5: Older disaster data before 1980 are considered less reliable. The paper explores
    the impact of climate disasters on economic growth, considering that climate disasters
    perform better as an instrument for economic growth in global panel studies than
    rainfall and temperature variation do. The authors recognize that the consequences
    of sudden natural disasters differ across countries due to factors like culture,
    infrastructure, and political institutions.
  6: Focuses on climate-related disasters defined as floods and storms. Only includes
    events that last less than one month. Uses the number of people affected by the
    disaster as the main variable of interest. Armed civil conflict onsets from the
    annually updated UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset are used.
  7: The paper controls for factors such as lagged GDP per capita growth, trade openness,
    foreign direct investment, investment share of GDP, government expenditure, and
    inflation.
  8: Floods and storms were examined separately, but their impacts were not statistically
    different. Population affected was the best predictor of growth compared to people
    killed and economic damage.
  11: The paper also examines the impact of climatic disasters on the risk of armed
    civil conflict onset.
  14: The study suggests the relationship between economic conditions and conflict
    risk is more complex or heterogeneous than suggested by earlier analyses.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic growth (GDP growth)
  4: The paper explores the relationship between climate-related disasters and economic
    growth, noting that such events can lead to declines in economic growth.

  14: Increase in the number of people affected by sudden climatic disasters leads
    to a reduction in total aggregate income growth by about 0.5 percentage points.
Outcomes of Interest:
  2: Climate-related disasters have a negative impact on short-run economic growth.
Quantitative material:
  1: Climate-related natural disasters have a negative effect on growth and that the
    impact is considerable.
  2: No quantitative information on the outcomes of interest is provided on this page.
  4: The hypothesis suggests that climate-related disasters have a negative effect
    on economic growth, but no specific quantitative data or metrics are provided
    on this page.
  5: N=4,354, Mean of Real GDP per capita growth (%) = 1.726, Std. dev. of Real GDP
    per capita growth (%) = 7.415, Min of Real GDP per capita growth (%) = -65.1,
    Max of Real GDP per capita growth (%) = 123.3; Descriptive statistics are provided
    for other variables including climate disasters and control variables.
  6: "Average annual real GDP per capita growth was 1.7% during the period 1980\u2013\
    2007. The data clearly have some extreme values, ranging from \u201365.1% in Iraq\
    \ (1991) and \u201362.4% in Liberia (1990) to 123.3% in Equatorial Guinea (1997).\
    \ 90% of observations are inside the \u20138.8% to 10.1% range."
  7: On average, less than 0.45% of the population is reported to need immediate assistance
    because of climate-related natural disasters for a given country-year. Some disasters
    affected up to 62% of the population. For any given event, on average, 1.4% of
    the population is affected.
  8: When the weighted population affected increases by one standard deviation (0.014),
    economic growth is predicatively reduced by 0.38 percentage points within the
    same year. The long-run growth reduction is predicatively 0.46 percentage points.
  9: Affecting floods (time weights) result in -31.0, affecting storms result in -24.0,
    and climatic disaster (dummy) results in -0.53 on GDP per capita growth, with
    noted significance levels.
  11: A one percentage point increase in the disaster variable is associated with
    a 0.18 percentage point reduction in economic growth.
  13: GDP/capita growth shows negative coefficients in relation to conflict variables.
    For example, conflict onset shows a coefficient of -0.38*** (significant at the
    1% level), conflict incidence -0.0020*** (significant at the 1% level). Also,
    GDP/capita growth has negative coefficients in relation to population-weighted
    storm effects.
  14: An increase by one standard deviation in the number of people affected by sudden
    climatic disasters leads to a total aggregate income growth reduction of about
    0.5 percentage points.
