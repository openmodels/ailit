Drivers of Risk:
  2: No relevant information
  4: Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI), GDP per capita (GDPc), long term external
    debt (EDLT), historical public debt (PD), net official development assistance
    per capita (NODAc), total population (POP), urban population (UPOP), population
    density (POPD), agricultural area (AGR), forest area (FOR), mean years of schooling
    (MYS), government effectiveness (GE), political stability (PS), regulatory quality
    (RQ), political rights (PR), and civil liberties (CL).
  5: GDPC, EDLT, PD, NODAC, POP, PD, UPOP, AGR, FOR, MYS, PS, GE, RQ, PR, and CL are
    covariates at level 1; country-level factors (level 2); year effects (level 3).
  7: 'The following variables are used as explanatory variables: GDPC (likely GDP
    per capita), EDLT (likely external debt), PD (likely population density), NODAC
    (unclear), POP (population), POPD (population density), UPOP (urban population),
    AGRI (agricultural land), FOR (forest land), MYS (mean years of schooling), PS,
    GE, RQ (unclear), PR, CL (unclear).'
  9: Country group (Developing, Transition economies, Developed), GDPC (variable definition
    not on this page), PD (variable definition not on this page), NODAC (variable
    definition not on this page), POP (variable definition not on this page), POPD
    (variable definition not on this page), UPOP (variable definition not on this
    page), AGR (variable definition not on this page), MYS (variable definition not
    on this page), PS (variable definition not on this page), GE (variable definition
    not on this page), RQ (variable definition not on this page).
  10: Public debt accumulation (PD), official development assistance (NODAc), total
    population (POP), population density (POPD), and agricultural land use (AGR) lead
    to increased vulnerability.
Highlights:
  1: Less-developed countries show increased vulnerability compared to developed countries
    and those in transition stages.
  2: The study aims to explore the effect of different macro-level characteristics
    on national climate change vulnerability, using the ND-GAIN Climate Change Vulnerability
    Index (CVI) as a dependent variable.
  9: Developing countries positively affect vulnerability performance compared to
    transition and developed economies. GDPC, UPOP, MYS, PS, GE, and RQ show a negative
    effect on the level of vulnerability.
  10: Economic growth (GDPc), demographic transition from rural to urban areas (UPOP),
    human capital development (MYS) and formal institutional arrangements (PS, GE
    and RQ) all contribute to reduced vulnerability to climate change.
Methodology:
  1: "The analysis uses a 1995\u20132016 annual time series dataset from 192 countries."
  2: This study aims to explore the effect of different macro-level characteristics
    on national climate change vulnerability. The dependent variable is the Notre
    Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN) Climate Change Vulnerability Index
    (CVI).
  4: "A 3-level hierarchical linear multilevel (HLM) model is utilized to assess the\
    \ effects of the explanatory variables on country-level climate vulnerability.\
    \ The analysis uses a 1995\u20132016 annual time series panel dataset of 192 countries."
  5: Linear mixed effects hierarchical models using lme4 library in R are used to
    analyze the relationship between dependent variables and explanatory factors;
    model comparison approach using likelihood ratio test (LRT) is used to assess
    model fit.
  7: A hierarchical linear model approach is used. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test suggests
    the vulnerability variable is normally distributed, justifying the choice of model.
  9: Hierarchical Linear Multilevel (HLM) model with backward elimination algorithm
    for covariate selection. Likelihood ratio tests were used for model comparisons.
  10: 3-level hierarchical linear multilevel model.
More Notes:
  2: The study aims to determine how country-level indices influence the level of
    vulnerability on a national level.
  5: The model formulation assumes 'Year' variable is a random effects covariate,
    and the variance partition coefficient (VPC) is calculated to measure its random
    effects; the study uses categorical predictor variable of country with 'Developing'
    as the reference category.
  7: The abbreviations used for the explanatory variables are not defined within the
    text, which makes interpretation difficult.
  9: The specific measure of vulnerability performance is not defined on this page,
    and the definitions of the independent variables (GDPC, PD, NODAC, POP, POPD,
    UPOP, AGR, MYS, PS, GE, RQ) are not provided.
  10: Less-developed nations demonstrate increased climate change vulnerability levels
    compared to developed ones.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: No relevant information
  4: Country-level climate vulnerability, proxied by the ND-GAIN index.
  5: Vulnerability (yijk) is the continuous estimation variable, potentially related
    to macroeconomic outcomes through covariates.
  7: The 'vulnerability index' (CVI) is the response variable in the analysis. The
    CVI appears to be a summary of the country's vulnerability.
  9: Vulnerability performance (the specific measure is not defined on this page).
  10: Country-level climate change vulnerability (CVI).
Quantitative material:
  2: No relevant information
  7: Descriptive statistics (mean, median, min, max) are provided for the vulnerability
    index (CVI) and the explanatory variables. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test results
    (D=0.607; p-value<0.001) are reported.
  9: Parameter estimates and 95% confidence intervals for significant covariates are
    provided in Table 5. For example, a unit increase in GDPC is associated with a
    -0.007 change in vulnerability performance with a 95% confidence interval of (-0.008,
    -0.0071).
  10: PD has a positive effect on CVI (beta = 0.0054; p-value < 0.05); NODAC (beta
    = 0.0071; p-value < 0.05); POP (beta = 0.000106; p-value < 0.05); POPD (beta =
    0.0034; p-value < 0.05); AGR (beta = 0.0012; p-value < 0.05).
