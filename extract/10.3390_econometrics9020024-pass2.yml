Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, specifically increased CO2 concentrations (potentially beneficial)
    and high local temperatures (potentially negative).
  3: Climatic system (global warming, CO2 fertilization, extreme events); Prices system
    (output and input prices); Technology system (agricultural practices, modified
    seeds, fertilizers)
  4: "Temperature thresholds above 28, 29, 30, or 31\xB0C during the soybean growth\
    \ period and precipitation patterns are considered as drivers of risk for soybean\
    \ yields."
  5: Global temperature anomalies, Global CO2 concentration, Consumption of fertilizers
    (phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen), Drought
  6: Changes in technology (no-till practices, new modified seeds, GM crops), input
    prices (fertilizer, agricultural land), and climate variables are considered as
    potential drivers of crop yield, specifically soybean yield.
  7: "Global temperature anomalies (temp), number of days with maximum temperatures\
    \ above 28, 29, 30 and 31\u25E6C (max28, max29, max30 and max31, respectively),\
    \ CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere (ln CO2), adoption of no tillage (notill),\
    \ prices of seeds (lnseeds) and fertilizer (lnpfertilizer), soybean prices (lnpsoybean)"
  8: "Shocks impacting outcomes include weather anomalies, La Ni\xF1a, El Ni\xF1o,\
    \ and stationary weather variables like maximum temperature thresholds and excessive\
    \ precipitation affecting soybean yields in Argentina."
  11: Increased CO2 concentration and cumulated days of high temperature.
Highlights:
  1: Soybean yields adjust to disequilibria reflecting technological improvements;
    CO2 concentrations have a positive effect, potentially due to accelerated photosynthesis;
    high local temperatures have a negative effect.
  3: Soybean yields can be simultaneously influenced by climatic, technological, and
    economic factors.
  4: Extreme heat and precipitation patterns during the growing season are significant
    determinants of soybean yield, which in turn impacts macroeconomic factors.
  5: Global temperatures can have long-run negative effects on crops such as the development
    of plagues and pests; increased CO2 may have positive effects on plant growth,
    but only if nutrient levels, soil moisture, water availability and other conditions
    are met.
  8: Soybean and fertilizer prices have a significant long-run effect on soybean yields,
    and technological advances such as GM seeds and no-till practices are considered.
  11: Technology model has a long-run dominance in explaining soybean yields; climate
    factors explain short-run yield variation.
Methodology:
  1: Multivariate time-series framework; partial system approach considering climatic,
    technological, and economic factors; automatic model selection for dynamic specification;
    encompassing tests of economic hypotheses.
  3: Econometric approach encompassing climatic, technological, and economic factors
    to determine crop yields; Uses annual series data from 1971 to 2015 for Argentina.
  4: The analysis uses daily temperature and precipitation data from 54 meteorological
    stations in the soybean production area and evaluates the impact of extreme heat
    and precipitation on soybean yield.
  5: Econometric analysis of soybean yields in Argentina, considering climate variables
    and fertilizer use. Applicable to understanding the impact of climate change on
    agricultural productivity in Argentina.
  6: A cointegration approach is adopted to study the effects of crop-yield drivers,
    working with partial systems to deal with dimensionality, collinearities, and
    endogeneity issues. The methodology involves estimating different equilibrium
    relationships from separated systems, using deviations to explain inflation dynamics
    and, in this case, crop yields. It uses a multivariate cointegration approach
    to model the long-run behavior of soybean yields using climate, technological,
    and economic systems. A 'specific to general' strategy helps identify and interpret
    long-run structure with plausible equilibrium correction coefficients in the case
    of multivariate cointegration, particularly when the sample is relatively short.
  7: "Cointegration analysis of smaller blocks of variables (climate, technological,\
    \ and input\u2013output prices) are used to restructure and simplify the empirical\
    \ problem. VAR models with two lags are estimated. Encompassing is used to test\
    \ if deviations are significant. Unit root tests (ADF, PP, KPSS) are performed\
    \ to test for stationarity."
  8: The analysis uses cointegration analysis within a VAR framework, employs Autometrics
    for model selection, and includes long-run and short-run modeling of soybean yields
    based on historical data in Argentina, using impulse and step dummy variables.
  11: "Equilibrium correction model using instrumental variables, with results applicable\
    \ from 1971\u20132015."
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on Argentina, a major soybean producer and exporter. The CO2
    concentration considered is the global concentration.
  3: The study focuses on soybean production in Argentina, the third-largest producer
    of soybeans worldwide; Climate changes and technological advances shifted the
    main production area to the north, to warmer latitudes.
  5: The paper focuses on soybean yields as an outcome, but the broader implication
    is that climate change and CO2 levels can impact agricultural productivity. It
    also suggests that the benefits of increased CO2 on plant growth are conditional
    and can be negated by drought.
  8: The analysis details the adjustment of econometric models to address shifts in
    data, using methods like SIS and IIS to account for Argentine economic crisis
    impacts.
