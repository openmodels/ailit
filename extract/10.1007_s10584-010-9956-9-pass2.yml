Drivers of Risk:
  3: Hydroclimatic variability, persistent negative precipitation anomalies (drought),
    temperature and precipitation variability.
  5: Changes in temperature and precipitation, particularly affecting countries with
    economies sensitive to climate due to factors like reliance on agriculture, infrastructure
    status, and insurance systems.
  7: Climate variability, especially in smallholder rainfed agriculture; Climate contributes
    to price variability where markets and transportation are poorly developed.

Highlights:
  3: Persistent negative precipitation anomalies (drought) are found to be the most
    significant climate influence on economic growth in SSA.
  5: "The relative importance of climate aspects is a function of the sensitivity\
    \ of a country\u2019s economy to climate; industrialized economies may be most\
    \ sensitive to temperature changes while countries at lower latitudes and with\
    \ less diversified economies, precipitation changes may be as important or more\
    \ important than changes in temperature."
  7: Investigates climate effects on economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa to inform
    adaptation policy making. Aims to understand how economies are affected by climate.
  8: Climate variability has a significant effect on economic progress. Rainfall variability
    contributes to reduced economic productivity and increased poverty. Hydroclimatic
    variability is a major source of risk that remains unsuccessfully mitigated.
  9: No relevant information
  10: Hydroclimatic variability has a significant effect on households in SSA, especially
    the rural poor, and on national economic growth statistics.
  11: Climate represents a 'significant handicap,' representing 20% of the difference
    with industrialized countries in economic output.
  12: No relevant information
  13: Investigates the effect of hydroclimatic variability on the economic growth
    and welfare outcomes of countries in SSA using regression analysis to address
    the gap in analysis of the economic effects at the country scale.
  18: The panel data results using fixed and random effects are considered more robust
    than cross-country regressions and are the primary evidence for the analysis's
    conclusions.
  19: Fixed effects regressions are used to control for time-invariant country characteristics
    that are not directly observed and can make the variables correlated.
  21: Temperature tends to have a negative and statistically significant (at the 99%
    level) relationship with GDP growth when precipitation data is not included.
  22: Drought risk, measured by the WASP index, has a negative and statistically significant
    impact on GDP per capita growth in SSA countries.
  23: Drought has a negative impact on agricultural GDP in Sub-Saharan Africa; drought
    negatively affects industrial GDP; precipitation has a positive impact on industrial
    GDP; Positive rainfall anomalies are advantageous to agriculture
  24: Mean values of precipitation and temperature are relatively poor indicators
    of climate effects on economic growth in SSA compared to WASP variables (indicators
    of climate extremes). Severe drought is significantly associated with an increase
    in poverty (people living under $1/day).
  25: Drought is the most influential climate effect on economic growth in Sub-Saharan
    Africa (SSA) as measured in this study.
  26: Drought has a significant negative effect on agricultural value added and a
    significant positive effect on poverty; Above average rains have a positive benefit
    to agricultural value added; Temperature is only significant when precipitation
    is not included.
  27: Drought has a consistent negative effect on economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa.
    Temperature may not be indicative of the most important climate effects on economic
    growth; drought may be of greater concern.
  28: Hydroclimatic variability is a major impediment to agricultural productivity
    in SSA and its effects penetrate to the level of national economies.
  29: Improving the ability of economies to manage their current climate challenges
    is the foundation of adaptation.
  38: Significance markers (asterisks) indicate statistically significant relationships
    between the drivers and the outcome(s) of interest. The results are contingent
    on the model setup (fixed effects vs. random effects).
  41: Analysis focuses on the statistical relationship between 'Charisma' and an unspecified
    dependent variable 'Y', with 'X' representing other unspecified factors.
Methodology:
  3: Cross-country and panel regressions are used to analyze the effect of hydroclimatic
    variability on economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The study uses a new
    national-level precipitation statistic.
  7: Econometric analysis of national-level economic growth and climate data.

  11: Cross-country regression analyses are used to investigate the role of geography
    and climate in economic development.
  12: No relevant information
  13: Regression analysis, building on the work of Barrios et al. (2008), to investigate
    the effect of hydroclimatic variability on economic growth and welfare outcomes
    of countries of SSA.
  14: Panel data analysis using livelihood measures (per capita economic growth, industrial
    value added to GDP, and poverty headcount ratios) and climate data (temperature
    and precipitation). Spatially averaged national values and an alternative approach
    to creating a national level precipitation statistic are employed.
  16: Analysis uses the WASP index to separate anomalous low rainfall (drought) from
    high rainfall (flooding), considering the full annual cycle rather than calendar
    year.
  17: Cross-country regressions are used to establish a relationship between climate
    variability and livelihood indicators.
  18: Panel data analysis using fixed effects and random effects regressions for the
    years 1975-2003.
  19: Basic fixed effects regression using panel data for 42 SSA countries. Standard
    errors are clustered and non-clustered at the country-level.
  20: Panel data regressions using fixed effects and random effects models; Hausman
    Test to determine the most appropriate model.
  21: Cross-country regressions using average values over the years 1962-2003 for
    each of the variables except in the case of Industrial GDP Value Added (1999-2003).
    Panel regressions also used (but not results presented on this page). Fixed effects
    and random effects used in some regressions.
  22: Cross-country regressions using data from countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
    with WASP variables as measures of precipitation variability.
  23: Regressions were performed using various hydroclimate variables as predictors
    for Agricultural GDP Value Added, Industrial GDP value added, and poverty headcounts
    in Sub-Saharan African countries.
  24: Cross-country regression analysis; Panel data analysis with fixed effects and
    random effects regressions using annual values from 1975-2003
  25: Panel regressions with fixed and random effects models based on Hausman tests.
  26: Fixed effects regressions with clustered standard errors (the preferred specification)
  27: Cross-country and panel regression analysis examining the historical effect
    of climate on economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa.
  28: The study uses the WASP index to represent drought. The study analyses the effects
    of the WASP index on economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
  38: The analysis uses fixed effects and random effects models, likely applied to
    panel data. The notes mention heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. The use
    of first and third lags of some variables (e.g., MAP-1st, MAP-3rd) suggests a
    dynamic analysis, looking at how past values of certain variables influence current
    outcomes.

    *p<0.10, **p<0.05, ***p<0.01. Variance covariance estimations referenced. Operational
    code 0.1.1 noted.'
More Notes:
  3: The study suggests that hydroclimatic risks, namely drought, may be the priority
    concern for adaptation to climate change in Sub-Saharan Africa, contrary to the
    focus of many climate change impact assessments on temperature increases.
  5: The paper emphasizes the importance of identifying and considering the most significant
    climate risks to economic growth, especially in developing countries with scarce
    resources.
  7: The paper will review previous studies of climate change impacts on economic
    growth in SSA and investigate the current vulnerabilities of SSA economies.
  8: The impact of climate on economic growth varies with the scale of the study,
    with case studies finding a dominant and negative effect in Sub-Saharan Africa
    (SSA). Rural households have limited means for managing covariant risks associated
    with climate variability, which contributes to risk aversion and less profitable
    investments.
  9: The paper mentions studies on the impact of rainfall variability on income, income
    inequality, and poverty at the village or household level in India, Ethiopia,
    and Cameroon. While these studies provide insights into microeconomic impacts
    of climate risk and adaptation strategies, they don't directly address macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level. Therefore, this page provides supporting
    evidence of climate change risks for small geographies.
  11: 'The page highlights a gap in research: the effects of hydroclimatic variability
    on national economies of Sub-Saharan Africa are rarely addressed.'
  12: This page discusses studies looking at the effect of climate variability and
    means on farm income in different countries (US, Brazil, India, Africa).
  17: The cross-country regressions are primarily used to establish the existence
    of a substantial relationship and are not intended to be directly comparable across
    countries. The WASP index preserves spatial variability of rainfall and drought
    across a country.
  19: The identifying assumption is that the effect of the time-invariant country
    characteristics does not change over time.
  20: The analysis explores the relationship between climate variability and macroeconomic
    outcomes, but the specific outcomes are not detailed on this page.
  22: The positive WASP variables (flood risk) did not produce statistically significant
    or consistent results, suggesting the need for improved flood data to separate
    the effects of strong rains and floods.
  23: The drought effect on industrial GDP may be due to reduced hydroelectricity
    and upstream effects of poor agricultural production. The positive relationship
    between precipitation and industrial GDP may be due to hydroelectricity production
    or agricultural inputs.
  24: Fixed effects regressions control for time-invariant country characteristics.
  25: The use of fixed vs random effects depends on the regression, with fixed effects
    being preferred for basic regressions and random effects being preferred when
    WASP variables are included.
  27: Results are stronger at a 1 year lag, which may indicate a delay caused by the
    propagation of the drought effect through agriculture to the secondary industries
    relying on agricultural inputs.
  28: The study acknowledges that the WASP index is effective at representing drought
    but not flood events.
  29: Rural populations dependent on rainfed agriculture, who make up 93% of the population
    of SSA, remain immensely vulnerable to drought leading to a poverty trap of highly
    vulnerable, low productivity subsistence level agriculture.
  41: The table presents regression coefficients, standard errors, F-statistics, and
    number of observations (N), which are standard components of regression output.
    The specific meanings of 'Charisma', 'X', and 'Y' are not defined on this page.
