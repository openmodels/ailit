Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change leading to more frequent heatwaves (HWs). Specifically, high greenhouse
    gas (GHG) concentrations (RCP 8.5) and moderate GHG concentrations (RCP 4.5).
  5: Changes in temperature indices, specifically daily maximum temperature (Tx),
    daily minimum temperature (Tn), and derived indices such as Tn10P, Tn90P, Tx10P,
    Tx90P, and DTR (diurnal temperature range).
  7: Increasing daily average maximum temperatures
  9: Heatwaves (HWs), particularly during the austral summer (DJF), and prolonged
    berg winds resulting from the anticyclonic flow by the Atlantic High, which is
    more equator-ward during winter.
  10: Increasing average temperatures, which may cause present-day heatwave thresholds
    to be exceeded more easily.
  14: Increased heatwave frequency and duration in Southern Africa due to climate
    change, specifically under RCP 4.5 (moderate emission) and RCP 8.5 (high emission)
    scenarios.
Highlights:
  1: The north-western part of South Africa is expected to have the most drastic increase
    in HWs occurrences. The central interior is projected to experience longer-lasting
    HWs.
  7: Significant warming is projected, with inland areas experiencing greater temperature
    increases than coastal regions.
  9: Most regions experience HWs during the austral summer (DJF), except for subtropical
    western to south-west coastal regions which experience HWs mainly between May
    and August. The model (CCAM) simulates a somewhat larger number of HWs than what
    is observed in general, and has challenges simulating winter HWs over the west
    in the present-day climate. The simulations also indicate a relatively high number
    of HWs in the eastern part of the country in winter, compared to observations.
  10: The CCAM model simulates present-day climate with high skill, suggesting its
    future projections can be considered with some confidence. Simulations capture
    seasonal differences in heatwave frequency, with the highest number in summer
    and the lowest in winter.
  14: The study projects increased heatwave frequency and duration in Southern Africa
    by 2070-2099, with more severe impacts under the high emission scenario (RCP 8.5)
    compared to the moderate emission scenario (RCP 4.5). MAM seasons show higher
    intensity compared to JJA seasons.
Methodology:
  1: "An ensemble of regional climate model downscalings obtained from the Conformal\
    \ Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) for the periods 2010\u20132039, 2040\u20132069,\
    \ and 2070\u20132099, with 1983\u20132012 as the historical baseline. Simulations\
    \ were performed under RCP 4.5 and 8.5."
  5: Trend analysis of temperature indices from 1983 to 2012. Significance at the
    95% level of confidence is indicated. Heatwaves were also counted per station.
  7: Climate model simulations using RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
  9: Analysis of observed heatwave data from 1983-2012. Climate simulations were performed
    using CCAM forced with CCSM4, for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.
  10: The study uses the CCAM model with CCSM4 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios to
    project heatwave characteristics. It defines heatwaves using present-day thresholds.
  14: Simulations are performed to project heatwave frequency, duration, and intensity
    for Southern Africa from 2070 to 2099 under different climate scenarios (RCP4.5
    and RCP8.5). The results represent 50th percentile values.
More Notes:
  5: The paper focuses on observed trends in temperature indices and heatwave occurrences
    in South Africa, but the information in the provided page doesn't directly quantify
    the macroeconomic/fiscal outcomes or costs/benefits of adaptation.
  7: The paper focuses on temperature changes; no explicit macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes are discussed on this page. The projections are for the 50th percentile.
  9: The study focuses on the frequency and duration of heatwaves, but does not quantify
    the macroeconomic or fiscal impacts. The analysis identifies regions particularly
    susceptible to heatwaves and evaluates the ability of a climate model to simulate
    these events.
  10: The observed heatwave duration is based on a limited number of weather stations
    (24) across the country, which may affect the accuracy of the model in certain
    regions.
  14: The paper focuses on the physical impacts of climate change (heatwaves) rather
    than directly quantifying macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. However, these physical
    impacts have downstream economic consequences, such as decreased productivity,
    increased healthcare costs, and strain on infrastructure which will affect macroeconomic
    and fiscal outcomes.

    \ much of the interior of South Africa by 2070\u20132099 with respect to 1983\u2013\
    2012 under a high GHG concentration. Short lasting HWs (average of 3\u20134 days)\
    \ along the coastal areas are expected to increase in frequency."

    C/year) and significance level. Total number of heatwave occurrences per station\
    \ is also provided."
  7: "Daily average maximum temperatures are projected to increase by up to 2\xB0\
    C during the period 2010 to 2039 as compared to the reference period of 1983 to\
    \ 2012 during summer across the country\u2019s plateau. The RCP 8.5 projections\
    \ show increases of over 3\xB0C in four provinces of South Africa and parts of\
    \ Lesotho in the period 2040-2069 compared to 1983-2012."
