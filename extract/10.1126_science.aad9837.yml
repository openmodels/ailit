Drivers of Risk:
  1: Current temperature climatologies and future warming.
  2: Current climatic events such as droughts or tropical cyclones influencing social
    outcomes today, irrespective of future climate changes.
  5: Climate variables including temperature, cyclone wind speed, rainfall anomalies,
    and ENSO measures.
  6: GDP falls gradually but persistently during the 15 years following exposure to
    tropical cyclones.
  7: Cyclones and high temperature events are impacting GDP and mortality rates.
  8: Climate change, high temperatures, rainfall, labor productivity losses, market
    reactions.
  9: Low rainfall; Tropical cyclones; Temperatures (both high and low); Extreme heat
    events
  10: Trends in temperature, monsoon characteristics, rainfall, solar radiation, cyclones,
    realized temperatures
  11: No relevant information
  12: Warming trends since 1980.
  13: Hotter locations with more extreme rainfall patterns and major disturbances
    such as ENSO and tropical cyclones generally face additional health costs, lower
    productivity, and economic costs.
Highlights:
  1: Both current and future losses can theoretically be avoided if populations adapt
    to fully insulate themselves from the climate.
  2: Current climate conditions play a substantial role in shaping society; economic
    and social burden of the current climate is comparable to future projections.
  5: Climate variables influence social and economic outcomes in many sectors and
    contexts.
  6: GDP in countries exposed to tropical cyclones falls gradually but persistently
    during the 15 years following exposure.
  7: Cyclone-related GDP effects are most negative in countries with the lowest levels
    of historical cyclone exposure; temperature-induced mortality adaptations are
    observed in certain locations in the US.
  8: Patterns in the overall macroeconomic responses to temperature are consistent
    with labor effects playing an important role.
  9: Low rainfall slows national incomes in Africa, tropical cyclone strikes slow
    GDP growth, temperature has a nonlinear effect on economic production, and the
    effects of temperature and cyclones are globally generalizable.
  10: Climate change is projected to significantly impact agricultural yields, GDP
    growth, and total factor productivity globally and in specific regions like India,
    Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern USA, and China.
  11: No relevant information
  12: Warming trends have had a small but measurable negative impact on global GDP
    growth.
  13: The magnitude of influence current climatic conditions have on social outcomes
    is often comparable to the projected effects of future warming; adaptation technologies
    are extraordinarily costly.
Methodology:
  2: Quantitative empirical research mixing climate, social, and statistical sciences;
    focus on causal effects of climate on populations using statistical and spatiotemporal
    models.
  6: Empirical studies identifying dynamic relationships between climate variables
    and social outcomes.
  8: The current structure of the global economy represents a spatial equilibrium
    in which the location of populations and sites of economic production are all
    determined by the functioning of markets.
  9: "An alternative \u201Ctop down\u201D approach examines how the macro-economy\
    \ as a whole responds to climatic conditions; This approach is usually implemented\
    \ by examining total income or gross domestic product (GDP) per capita as the\
    \ outcome of interest; Examining subsamples of data from around the world, including\
    \ both rich and poor countries."
  10: Studies use different methodologies to attribute climate impacts on agriculture
    and income, including regression analysis relating yields/income to temperature,
    rainfall, solar radiation, and cyclones; and simulation models projecting future
    impacts based on climate change scenarios.
  11: The paper outlines a methodology to "reconstitute" distributions of impacts
    from climate by mapping distributions of multiple climatic events back onto empirically
    recovered dose-response functions to reconstruct distributions of predicted outcomes
    attributable to weather distributions.
  12: Calculations using data from other studies (100, 183) are used to estimate GDP
    growth impact.
  13: The research discusses holding all other factors constant to determine the optimal
    level of adaptation investments and identifies the adaptation 'gap'.
More Notes:
  1: The paper points out that society may benefit from attending to ongoing impacts
    of climate in the present, because current climatic conditions impose economic
    and social burdens on populations today that rival in magnitude the projected
    end-of-century impacts of climate change.
  5: The page reviews findings at various scales, examining effects on human health,
    economic conditions, and social interactions.
  6: Focuses on aggregate impact of climate change on GDP, rather than specific mechanisms
    or policies.
  7: Comparisons across global and US contexts indicate different levels and mechanisms
    of adaptation to climate impacts.
  8: Reallocations across space and time can, in some contexts, mitigate the direct
    damages of climate; however, such reallocations may be limited.
  9: The effects of temperature on income in the United States remained essentially
    unchanged from 1960 to 2010, and gradual warming has effects identical to those
    of short-lived warming, leading to the conclusion that effective adaptation to
    temperature, at the macro level, is limited.
  10: The table presents a summary of attribution studies examining the effects of
    climate change on various outcomes, highlighting the social impact, region, period,
    and the effects of current climate distribution and trends on agriculture and
    income. Some studies use a relative measure of temperature or cyclones and compare
    to a baseline.
  11: The paper details a benchmark to compare the effects resulting from observed
    climates with those of societies that were continuously exposed to their best
    possible environmental conditions.
  13: It is emphasized that understanding the causes of adaptation gaps is key as
    they have large impacts on current and future well-being.

    \ that output is maximized around 13\xB0C; Enduring GDP losses may accumulate\
    \ and compound, leading to larger long-run losses if climatic events alter investment\
    \ behavior or capital depreciation; Cyclone-prone countries experience GDP losses\
    \ (per cyclone) much smaller than countries where storms are infrequent; Warming\
    \ will reduce birth rates 3%"

  10: "Between 1966 and 2002, trends in temperature, monsoon characteristics, and\
    \ rainfall lowered rice yields by 5.7% on average in India (Auffhammer et al.\
    \ 2012). By 2002, trends in temperature since 1981 caused annual losses of 40\
    \ megatons or $5 billion in major crop yields globally (Lobell and Field 2007).\
    \ Between 1980 and 2002, trends in temperature and precipitation lowered maize\
    \ and wheat yields by 3.8 and 5.5% globally; rice and soy were unaffected (Lobell\
    \ et al. 2011). Predicted climate change by 2050 lowers annual yields in Sub-Saharan\
    \ Africa by 22% for maize, 17% for sorghum and millet, 18% for groundnut, and\
    \ 17% for cassava (Schlenker and Lobell 2010). Relative to an optimal season at\
    \ 29\xB0C, realized temperatures lower annual maize yields by 48% on average in\
    \ Eastern USA (Schlenker and Roberts 2009). Predicted climate change by 2100 lowers\
    \ annual maize yields by 63 to 82% in Eastern USA (Schlenker and Roberts 2009).\
    \ Between 1979 and 2004, trends in temperature and solar radiation lowered rice\
    \ yield growth by 0 to 0.76% in South Asia (Welch et al. 2010). Relative to each\

    \ and between 2010 and 2100 lowers the global annual growth rate by 0.28 percentage\
    \ points on average (Burke et al. 2015). Relative to each county\u2019s optimal\
    \ annual temperature, realized county temperatures lowered the U.S. growth rate\
    \ between 1970 and 2011 by 1.69 percentage points on average (Deryugina and Hsiang\
    \ 2015). Predicted climate change by 2100 lowers the U.S. annual growth rate by\

    \ without cyclones, realized cyclones lowered the global annual growth rate between\
    \ 1970 and 2008 by 1.27 percentage points (Hsiang and Jina 2014). Predicted climate\
