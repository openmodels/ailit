Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change scenarios leading to biophysical yield shocks.
  2: Climate change effects on agricultural productivity, specifically changes in
    crop yields (YEXO) due to temperature and precipitation changes.
  3: The risk drivers identified are climate shocks and endogenous responses in models,
    influenced by regional impacts, trade flexibility, and land conversion.
  4: Climate change shock (YEXO) impacting agricultural yields.
  5: Negative productivity effect from climate change
  6: Climate change impacts on agricultural crop yields, specifically changes in yields
    of wheat, coarse grain, rice, and oil seeds, under the RCP 8.5 radiative forcing
    scenario. Limited CO2 fertilization effects are assumed.
Highlights:
  1: Agricultural production, crop-land area, trade, and prices show the greatest
    degree of variability in response to climate change, and consumption the lowest;
    model assumptions about ease of land use conversion, intensification, and trade
    are key sources of differences between models.
  2: Climate change reduces yields, raises prices, reduces consumption, and prompts
    reallocation of production through changes in farm management and acreage. Economic
    adjustment occurs through endogenous price responses.
  3: Significant variability in trade and area responses is attributed to assumptions
    about trade flexibility and land conversion. Consumption responds little to climate
    shocks due to low sensitivity to price changes.
  4: The models show varying degrees of impact and trade responsiveness, reflecting
    different model structures and assumptions. GCAM and GLOBIOM are the most trade-responsive
    models. There is variation across models in how climate change impacts production,
    consumption, and prices.
  5: Models transfer a large part of the climate change shock to production-side and
    trade responses. Analyses that limit climate change impact to biophysical effects
    alone significantly underestimate our capacity to respond.
Methodology:
  1: Nine global economic models of agriculture are used to represent endogenous responses
    to climate change scenarios; biophysical shocks are derived from IPCC's representative
    concentration pathway with end-of-century radiative forcing of 8.5 W/m2.
  2: The study uses a combination of general circulation models (GCMs), global gridded
    crop models (GGCMs), and economic models (both computable general equilibrium
    (CGE) and partial equilibrium).  Climate change effects on agricultural productivity
    are added to a reference scenario.  Results from seven scenarios based on five
    different crop models and two GCMs under RCP 8.5 are compared across nine economic
    models.
  3: The analysis uses regression analysis and analysis of variance to assess the
    contribution of various sources such as economic models, climate models, crops,
    products, and regions to variability in response variables.
  4: The study uses multiple integrated assessment models (IAMs) to simulate the economic
    impacts of climate change-induced yield shocks (YEXO) on agriculture and related
    sectors across 13 regions, four crops, and seven scenarios. Regression analysis
    is used to quantify the relationship between YEXO and various economic outcome
    variables for each model.
  5: Compares responses of agriculture to climate change across a set of global economic
    models (AIM, ENVISAGE, GTEM, FARM, MAgPIE, GCAM, IMPACT, MAGNET, GLOBIOM).
  6: The study uses global computable general equilibrium (CGE) economic models and
    partial equilibrium models. Climate shocks are implemented as shifts in land efficiency
    parameters in CGE models and as additive shifters in yield or supply equations
    in partial equilibrium models. Crop model data from ISI-MIP are used as inputs.
    Models are run with GDP and population values from Shared Socioeconomic Pathway
    2 (SSP2).
More Notes:
  1: The study identifies where models disagree on the relative responses to climate
    shocks and highlights research activities needed to improve the representation
    of agricultural adaptation responses to climate change.
  2: The magnitude of responses varies significantly across models, crops, and regions.
    The models capture general effects but have large differences in the relative
    contribution of response options.
  4: The study focuses on agricultural productivity shocks and their economic consequences,
    particularly concerning trade responses and regional reallocation of production.
  5: Model specification and parameter choice affect the results. The CGE models all
    have their roots in the Global Trade Analysis Project database and the CGE optimizing
    approach and so have similar model specifications but parameterization choices
    result in very different outcomes. Some models rely on an integrated world market
    representation (GLOBIOM, GCAM, and IMPACT), whereas others use Armington elasticities
    (CGE models) or self-sufficiency constraints (MAgPIE). Two climate models used
    are HadGEM2-ES and IPSL-CM5A-LR GCMs using the RCP 8.5.
  6: The study focuses on the direct yield effects of climate change by 2050, not
    including effects of increased ozone, biotic stresses, or extreme events. Exogenous
    agricultural productivity changes from research and extension efforts were also
    aligned across models using IMPACT modeling suite estimates.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Consumption reduction due to climate change is analyzed.
  2: Changes in consumption (CONS), production, and producer prices (PRICE).
  3: The paper focuses on variability in economic variables such as production (PROD),
    trade share (TRSH), consumption (CONS), and prices (PRICE), assessing their response
    to climate shocks.
  4: Impacts on total economic output (YTOT), endogenous yield response (YENDO), cultivated
    area (AREA), agricultural production (PROD), trade responsiveness (TRSH), consumption
    (CONS), and price.
  5: Consumption responses are relatively small across the models. Climate change
    responses largely occur through land use change, management intensity, and trade
    adaptation, influencing human well-being.
Quantitative material:
  1: Mean biophysical yield effect with no incremental CO2 fertilization is a 17%
    reduction globally by 2050 relative to a scenario with unchanging climate; endogenous
    economic responses reduce yield loss to 11%, increase area of major crops by 11%,
    and reduce consumption by 3%.
  2: The mean biophysical effect of climate change is a 17% decline in yields (YEXO).
    Endogenous responses lead to a mean final yield decline (YTOT) of 11%, area increase
    of 11%, a 2% decline in production, a 3% decline in consumption (CONS), and a
    20% increase in producer prices (PRICE).
  3: Yes, the paper provides quantitative analysis measuring variance contributions
    for model variables such as productivity shock (YEXO), final yield (YTOT), agricultural
    area (AREA), production (PROD), trade share (TRSH), and consumption (CONS).
  4: Table 2 provides regression coefficients (slope and intercept) for the relationship
    between YEXO and various economic outcomes (YTOT, YENDO, AREA, PROD, TRSH, CONS,
    PRICE) for different models (AIM, ENVISAGE, FARM, GCAM, GLOBIOM, GTEM, IMPACT,
    MAGNET, MAgPIE).
  6: "Yields are generated at 0.5\xB0 resolution (about 55.5 km at the equator) for\
    \ 2000 and 2050. Variables reported by crop models include YEXO, YTOT, AREA, CONS,\
    \ and PRICE. Trade share (TRSH) is defined as the 2050 difference in net imports\
    \ between climate change scenarios and a reference scenario, divided by 2050 production\
    \ in the reference scenario."
