Drivers of Risk:
  1: Not explicitly stated, but the study aims to address uncertainties in forest
    carbon markets, implying that market factors and inaccurate measurement methodologies
    can hinder effective carbon sequestration.
  2: Uncertainty in forest carbon sequestration is a driver of risk, leading to potential
    invalidation of offset protocols and undermining climate action efforts.

    afforestation, and agroforestry which can all be impacted by climate change
  6: No relevant information
  8: Deforestation surrounding the forest area is mentioned.
  11: The study mentions intentional and unintentional forest carbon reversals, suggesting
    forest disturbances (likely from events not explicitly studied on this page) can
    impact NEE. A one-year reversal of +4.79 tCO2eq is mentioned, suggesting such
    reversals are drivers of risk.

    as currency value and national/sub-national environmental regulation are considered
    drivers of risk for forest carbon projects.
  21: Extreme weather conditions (excluding catastrophic events like wildfire, multi-year
    drought, and hurricanes) are mentioned as potential risks. Climate change and/or
    anthropogenic activity are mentioned as a risk that may reverse observed trends
    in carbon sequestration.

Highlights:
  1: The Direct Measurement Forest Carbon Protocol reduces risk of voluntary and compliance
    market products worldwide to assist in the management of global warming and demonstrates
    new economic incentives to reverse deforestation with up to 5x the revenue compared
    to contemporary voluntary offsets.
  2: The paper argues that forest carbon sequestration uncertainty can undermine climate
    action policies and carbon markets, and highlights the need for more accurate
    measurement methods.
  3: The paper highlights that NEE offers a transformative advancement compared to
    estimation protocols for annual net forest carbon sequestration that lack direct
    CO2 measurement. The objective is to commercialize large-scale, direct measurement
    of vertical gross forest CO2 fluxes.
  4: The DMFCP framework connects physical carbon measurements (GPP, Reco, NEE) to
    project carbon (verified and registered net carbon sequestered) and ultimately
    to financial carbon (carbon credits for voluntary and compliance markets).
  6: The system allows for landowners to benefit from initial upfront payments and
    annual royalty payments on sales. Multiple projects can be listed in a registry
    and grouped into pooled portfolios. Carbon credits can be purchased by voluntary
    and compliance buyers worldwide.
  11: HF and AP sites showed active forest carbon sequestration and generation of
    carbon credits.
  14: The table highlights aspects related to carbon offset projects, such as ensuring
    additionality (that the project leads to emissions reductions beyond what would
    have occurred otherwise), having strict validation and verification processes,
    and testing for emissions switching (whether emissions are simply shifted elsewhere).
    It indicates the importance of independent third-party validation and verification.
    The goal is to attain a net positive carbon balance in forest management.
  15: The carbon is a primary and investor carbon interval with short carbon budgets.
    The DMFCP is based on atmospheric can be used to employ the three-gas method for
    CO2 fluxes. The study identifies and allows for landowner participation, planning,
    and expanded function. The three-gas method can be applied to surface aquatic
    and oceanic with the water.
  16: Highlights the importance of standardized measurement protocols and uncertainty
    analysis for forest carbon projects; discusses the need for standardized contract
    terms and performance metrics; evaluates errors in NEE from a single 30-min CO2
    measurement.
  17: Ankasa Park (tropical wet evergreen forest) generally exhibited greater carbon
    sequestration than Harvard Forest (temperate deciduous forest) during the study
    period.
  20: Commercialization of forest carbon research methodologies is feasible and applicable
    to forest projects worldwide. Diversifying forest projects into a portfolio reduces
    investment risk.
  21: DMFCPs can provide financial incentives for reforestation and forest management,
    potentially offsetting deforestation and anthropogenic disturbance. Long-term
    forest carbon projects are likely to increase harvest ages and management of forest
    stocking for optimal forest growth while promoting carbon benefits.
  24: Traditional forest carbon protocols do not appear capable of determining when
    a forest project switches to net positive emissions to the atmosphere on an annual
    basis; the DMFCP NEE measurements provide this diagnostic (#15).
  25: Traditional forest carbon protocols have shortcomings that do not contribute
    to evolving science of forest carbon sequestration and climate change studies.
    The estimation approach used by the UNFCCC for reporting emissions is flawed and
    inaccurate, hindering the advancement of carbon credit trading. The DMFCP can
    be applied to international emission reduction policies recognizing scientifically
    accepted methods, shared NEE data processing algorithms, and standardized terms
    and contracts for voluntary and compliance offsets.
  26: DMFCP enables creation of verified forest carbon financial products contributing
    to the improvement of methods that underpin large-scale forest conservation and
    reforestation.

Methodology:
  1: Direct Measurement Forest Carbon ProtocolTM based on standardized methods for
    direct determination of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 employing eddy covariance.  Uses
    a System-of-SystemsTM (SoS) network architecture with Global Monitoring PlatformTM
    (GMP) nodes that measure CO2 isotopologues (e.g., 12CO2, 13CO2, 14CO2) and greenhouse
    gases. Published annual NEE data for Ankasa Park, Ghana, Africa (tropical) and
    Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA, USA (deciduous) are used to forecast carbon revenue.
  2: The paper critiques estimation protocols that rely on forest mensuration and
    tree growth simulation models to infer annual changes in net forest carbon offsets,
    arguing these methods do not directly observe CO2 fluxes and introduce uncertainty.
  3: The DMFCP employs a network system architecture and sensor platform to account
    for carbon from measurement-to-monetization of net ecosystem exchange (NEE). It
    uses NEE data from research sites (Ankasa Park in Ghana and Harvard Forest in
    Massachusetts, USA) in combination with carbon pricing scenarios to project revenue
    across a large area. It compares landowner benefits and uncertainties between
    DMFCP and traditional estimation-based protocols.
  4: The Direct Measurement Forest Carbon Protocol (DMFCP) measures gross vertical
    fluxes of carbon in forest ecosystems using a SoS sensor network and a Global
    Monitoring Platform (GMP) to determine net ecosystem exchange (NEE).
  6: The methodology involves direct field measurement of NEE (CO2, CH4, and N2O)
    relative to a zero-emission baseline using SoS and GMPs. Verification of system
    performance by external third-party verifiers of reference values and calibration
    of GHG analyzers is performed according to operation of the SoS. Ex ante, annual
    accreditation periods that can be applied to multiple GHGs. Exits from a landowner
    agreement after 10 years with a penalty according to a ton-year accounting calculation.
  7: NEE data from online sources transformed into tones carbon dioxide equivalent
    per acre per year. Extrapolation of NEE to 100,000 acres (40,469 hectares) to
    illustrate GHG balance. Standing carbon inventory derived from biometric or remote
    sensing methods will be employed to augment and cross-check project NEE data.
  8: NEE data from the Ankasa Park eddy covariance tower was analyzed, focusing on
    the period from 2011 to 2014. The data is gap-filled, filtered and corrected for
    low friction velocity periods.
  11: NEE is measured using instruments (open or closed path CO2 analyzers) and standard
    calibration protocols. The DMFCP (hardware and software components) is used as
    an automated commercial field sensor network for automated reporting of data and
    verification of systems.
  14: The table describes various protocols and features related to carbon offset
    projects, including baseline establishment, additionality assessment, invalidation
    criteria, and compliance testing. It mentions methods for measuring carbon emissions
    and sequestration, such as using NEE (Net Ecosystem Exchange) and carbon analyzers.
  15: Eddy covariance is employed to determine CO2 flux and other emissions. Isotope
    analysis is used.
  16: Analyzes GHG flux data using eddy covariance and chamber measurements; addresses
    uncertainties in NEE data through standardized protocols, tower corrections, and
    up-scaling of flux averages; considers instrumentation and data processing errors;
    applies to forest carbon projects.
  17: NEE is measured over time at Harvard Forest and Ankasa Park, and the cumulative
    NEE is extrapolated across 100,000 acres. Linear regressions are performed on
    the NEE data for each location.
  20: The analysis uses hypothetical mixed carbon product types and projected pre-tax
    cash flows. The results are applicable to forest projects worldwide.
  21: The study uses hypothetical financial structures and cases for pre-tax revenue
    to illustrate the potential impact of the DMFCP. It considers the long-term cumulative
    value of sites and incorporates features of project biodiversity, such as Genetic
    Heat Indices. The analysis looks at revenue potential of mixed forest carbon products.
    It assumes that 100% of the products are sold in each case covering the cost of
    the DMFCP. It also uses eddy covariance based NEE.
  22: The paper describes a 'System of Systems' (SoS) architecture using eddy covariance
    towers and potentially remote sensing to measure NEE. Mentions open source eddy
    covariance processing software such as ONEFlux and commercial software. It emphasizes
    the need for direct CO2 measurements for verification, contrasting this with estimation
    and model simulation-based protocols.
  24: DMFCP NEE measurements provide this diagnostic (#15)
  25: The page discusses the limitations of traditional protocols that rely on estimation
    rather than direct measurement of GHG emissions. It contrasts these with the growing
    NEE (Net Ecosystem Exchange) methodology, which is presented as a more scientifically
    sound approach.
  26: DMFCP (a commercial standardized measurement-to-monetization system) for determining
    NEE (Net Ecosystem Exchange). The SoS and GMP components can be applied to GHGs
    across large scales and diverse locations and recalibrates existing voluntary

    The SoS and GMPs operate as an integrated autonomous system to monitor, measure
    and transform GHG flux data relative to local, regional and global reference materials
    for bulk and isotopic composition.

    with traditional protocols, emphasizing the DMFCP's benefits for landowners and
    its differences in methodology and assumptions. While the context is climate change
    and forest carbon sequestration, the information is not directly related to evaluating
    direct climate impacts like mortality or productivity loss in a way that's applicable
