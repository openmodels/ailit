Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changing frequency of extreme rain events, specifically floods and droughts,
    intensified by global warming and greenhouse gas emissions.
  2: Anthropogenic warming, increasing global mean temperature, hydroclimatic extremes
    (extreme precipitation, drought, flash floods), climate change, intense precipitation
    leading to floods, less precipitation leading to drought, continuous precipitation
    and temperature changes, shifting of subtropical westerly jet, topography, uneven
    population growth, and urbanization.
  3: Changes in precipitation amount, frequency, and intensity of precipitation extremes
    are analyzed under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).
  5: Changes in extreme precipitation (Consecutive dry days (CDD), Consecutive wet
    days (CWD), maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (rx5day)) leading to agriculture
    stress and flood risk. Drought events, estimated using the Standardized Precipitation
    Index (SPI). Projected intensity of 10% precipitation extremes events, estimated
    by the 10-year return level based on annual maxima precipitation.
  8: Increased precipitation leading to potential flood conditions, Variability in
    human activities (energy consumption, agricultural practices) influencing greenhouse
    gas emissions and land use changes.
  9: Changes in precipitation; Increasing temperature; Low emission scenarios SSP1-2.6
    and SSP2-4.5; High emission scenarios (SSP5-8.5)
  10: Changes in monsoon patterns, enhanced land-atmospheric interactions, inter-annual
    climate variability due to ENSO, high surface pressure over the Tibet region,
    and extreme temperature increases drive the identified risks.
  11: Changes in intensity of extreme precipitation events (Rx5day), consecutive dry
    days (CDD), and consecutive wet days (CWD) under different SSP scenarios.
  16: Changes in frequency of hydro-climate extreme events (rainfall intensity and
    frequency), increasing global temperature, variations in dryness to wetness in
    different SSPs scenarios.

Highlights:
  1: Extreme rainfall is projected to intensify, particularly in central and west
    Indian river basins. Lower Ganga basin may experience agricultural drought in
    the near future. Northern, central, and western river basins may experience more
    extremes under high-emission scenarios.
  2: India is one of the world's most vulnerable countries to hydro-climatic extremes
    which affect agricultural production and GDP.
  5: The study focuses on changes in extreme precipitation events, including droughts
    and floods, and uses various indices (CDD, CWD, Rx5day, SPI) to quantify these
    changes.
  8: Central Indian River Basins (IRBs) are projected to experience a significant
    increasing trend in precipitation, potentially leading to more frequent flood
    conditions. The intensity of precipitation increase is higher under high-emission
    scenarios.
  9: Projected daily precipitation is highly concentrated over the western and central
    IRBs; High variability in precipitation from low to high emission scenarios; Most
    of India's western river basins are projected to increase daily precipitation
    near to far future
  10: The study highlights potential flash drought intensification in the Ganga river
    basin and increased urban flood risk in peninsular Indian cities due to changing
    precipitation patterns. It also suggests potential impacts on sugarcane crop sugar
    content in the Ganga river basin.
  11: "The projected 5-day total precipitation shows the highest value of precipitation\
    \ of 600\u2013900 mm over the Indus, western Ghats, upper Ganga basin, and central\
    \ IRBs, including Narmada, Mahi, and Tapti."
  16: Extreme rainfall is projected to increase and intensify in many IRBs throughout
    the 21st century, especially after the 2040s. Western ghats, Indus, West, and
    central IRBs will be highly vulnerable due to intensification of extreme rainfall.
    The frequency of precipitation extremes over the west-flowing river basins and
    western Ghats of India is going to increase during the near and mid future, while
    intensity will be dominated over the Indus and upper Ganga basins.

Methodology:
  1: Evaluation of 12 Global Circulation Models from CMIP6, bias corrected with India
    Meteorological Department data. Ensemble model approach to examine projected changes
    in extreme rainfall.
  2: Uses Earth system models (ESMs) and climate model experiments from the sixth
    phase of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) to examine the changes in
    extremes; ETCCDI indices used to illustrate hydroclimate extremes during near,
    mid, and far future; researchers apply a bias correction method.
  3: "The study uses 12 CMIP6 models to project daily precipitation (2021\u20132100)\
    \ under four SSPs (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) to analyze changes\
    \ in extreme precipitation over 22 major Indian River Basins (IRBs). It compares\
    \ these projections with observed gridded rainfall data from the India Meteorological\
    \ Department (IMD) from 1951 to 2021.  A multi-model ensemble mean approach is\
    \ used to estimate future changes in hydroclimate extremes. The data is divided\
    \ into three time frames: Near-future (2021-2040), Mid-future (2041-2060), and\
    \ Far-future (2081-2100). Linear Scaling (LS) bias correction is applied."
  5: The analysis applies extreme precipitation indices from the Expert Team on Climate
    Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) using bias-corrected CMIP6 data sets and
    a multi-model ensemble (MME) approach to estimate changes in extreme precipitation
    over the IRBs (defined previously in the paper, but not on this page). It estimates
    drought using a standardized precipitation index (SPI) and examines drought events
    by fitting a gamma distribution to grid-level monthly rainfall values, calculated
    on a 3-month time scale for near, mid, and far future. The Generalized extreme
    value (GEV) distribution is utilized to examine the projected return level of
    precipitation extremes over the IRBs.
  8: Analysis of projected precipitation changes from 2021 to 2100 under different
    SSP emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5) using daily, monthly, and yearly
    data. The significance level is reported as p < 0.05.
  9: "Projections of precipitation changes in the near (2021\u20132040), mid (2041\u2013\
    2060), and far future (2081\u20132100) relative to 1995\u20132014 under different\
    \ SSP scenarios"
  11: Analysis of observed (1951-2021), historical (1951-2014), and projected (2021-2100)
    data for all SSP scenarios to determine changes in extreme precipitation events.
  16: Uses CMIP6 model simulations, multi-model mean (MMM) approach, SPI (Standardized
    Precipitation Index) for assessing wetness and dryness. Considers different SSP
    scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5). Focuses on Indian River Basins
    (IRBs) and projects changes throughout the 21st century, particularly post-2040s
    and 2081-2100.

More Notes:
  1: The study identifies hotspot regions for future urban flooding and highlights
    the need for adaptation and mitigation strategies.
  2: Focuses on hydroclimatic extremes and their impact on India, particularly agriculture.
  5: The paper mentions using climate indices relevant to agriculture stress and flood
    risk. The paper analyzes the future changing climatology and precipitation extremes,
    mainly using climate indices, such as Consecutive dry days (CDD), Consecutive
    wet days (CWD), and maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (rx5day).
  8: The projected population in 2050 over the affected river basins is approximately
    106.67 million, potentially increasing the economic costs of extreme weather events.
  10: The analysis uses climate model projections from CMIP6 under different SSP scenarios
    to assess precipitation changes.
  11: The study focuses on spatial changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme
    precipitation events across India under different climate scenarios but does not
    explicitly link these changes to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  16: The study supports basin-wise climate adaptation and mitigation strategies,
    including water and emergency services policies. The reliability of regional studies
    is challenged by uncertainty between models and coarser resolution. High emission
    scenario (SSP5-8.5) may still lead to significant impacts and changes in precipitation
    patterns despite not being as prominent as other scenarios (SSP1-2.6 to SSP3-7.0)
    in some projections.
  19: This page primarily contains bibliographic references. None of the titles or
    associated information directly discuss macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes,
    costs, benefits, or adaptation at a national level. The focus appears to be on
    climate modeling, precipitation patterns, drought forecasting, and agricultural
    impacts, primarily in the context of India and Asia.
