Drivers of Risk:
  1: Marine temperature extremes (marine heatwaves and marine cold spells) in the
    Mediterranean
Highlights:
  1: Summer 2018 experienced slightly more MHW activity than summer 2003; MHW activities
    were higher in the last two decades while winter MCS activities were higher in
    the 1980s-1990s; highest MHW activities occurred in the western Mediterranean
    while strongest MCS activities occurred in the eastern Mediterranean; the duration,
    mean intensity, and activity of the three strongest MHWs are twice as high as
    those of the three strongest MCSs.
Methodology:
  1: Ranks and evaluates marine temperature extreme events using a metric called 'activity'
    which combines the number of events, duration, intensity, and spatial extent.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the Mediterranean basin over the period 1982-2021.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: "Accelerated increase for summer MHWs (about +150\xB0C.days.10\u2076 km\xB2)\
    \ and a linear decrease for winter MCSs in the Mediterranean (about -60\xB0C.days.10\u2076\
    \ km\xB2) over the last four decades."
