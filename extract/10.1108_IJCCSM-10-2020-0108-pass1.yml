Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (both positive and negative shocks).
  2: Physical risks (increased frequency and severity of climate disasters) and transition
    risks (market volatility caused by climate policies and the shift to a low-carbon
    economy) are the main drivers of risk.
  5: Positive and negative shocks to average temperature (climate change).
  6: Positive and negative climate change (climate shocks)
  7: Climate change (proxied by average temperature)
  8: Temperature increase sequence (TEMP_i) and temperature decrease sequence (TEMP_d)
  9: Increases in average temperature (TEMP_i).
  10: Temperature changes (both increases and decreases), climate policies (including
    the speed of transition to a low-carbon economy)
  11: Positive and negative climate changes, including changes in temperature, impact
    financial stability.
  12: Temperature (TEMP), Carbon Dioxide Concentration
  13: CO2 emissions (both positive and negative changes), climate disasters
  14: Negative climate shocks (related to transition risks due to climate policies
    and regulations)
  17: Global warming
  18: Climate change
Highlights:
  1: Both positive and negative climate shocks do harm to financial stability; the
    effect of positive and negative climate shocks differ in the short and long term.
  2: The study focuses on the impact of climate change on financial stability in China
    and aims to provide empirical evidence that is lacking in existing research. It
    considers both short-term and long-term perspectives and uses the NARDL model
    for analysis.
  5: The study investigates the long-term and short-term transmission effects of increasing
    and decreasing average temperatures on financial stability.
  6: The long-term impact of climate shocks on financial stability can be asymmetric.
    The short-term transmission effect of climate change on financial stability can
    be asymmetric. The paper explores the effect of climate change on China's financial
    stability.
  7: "China\u2019s financial stability index shows a rising trend, indicating that\
    \ the stability of the Chinese financial system is constantly improving; However,\
    \ China\u2019s financial stability index has obvious volatility characteristics."
  9: Higher temperatures have a negative effect on China's financial stability.
  10: "Effects of climate change on financial stability are asymmetric; Transition\
    \ risk (too fast conversion to a low-carbon economy) can have a greater impact\
    \ on financial stability than natural disasters caused by climate change; There\
    \ is a long-term nonlinear relationship between climate change and \uFB01nancial\
    \ stability."
  11: The long-term damage of climate change on financial stability is greater than
    short-term effects.
  12: Climate change has a long-term negative asymmetry path to financial stability,
    though the degree of negative asymmetry is not large. The NARDL model's parameters
    and variance are stable.
  13: Both positive and negative changes in CO2 emissions have a statistically significant
    impact on financial stability (FS). Statistically significant asymmetry effects
    between positive and negative changes in climate conditions and the stability
    of the financial system.
  14: Climate change has a greater long-term impact on financial stability compared
    with short-term impact.
  17: Global warming has increased global economic inequality (Diffenbaugh and Burke,
    2019)
  18: Climate change impacts on farmland value in Bangladesh.
Methodology:
  1: Vector autoregression model and NARDL model to assess the nonlinear asymmetric
    effect of climate change on financial stability.
  2: The paper empirically tests the relationship between climate change and financial
    stability in China using the NARDL model to discuss the asymmetric transmission
    effect of climate change on financial stability from short-term and long-term
    perspectives.
  5: The paper uses a Non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model to analyze
    the asymmetric impact of positive and negative temperature shocks (climate change)
    on financial stability.
  6: Wald statistics are used to test for short-term and long-term asymmetry in the
    impact of climate shocks on financial stability. Asymmetric dynamic multipliers
    are calculated to observe the asymmetric transmission path of climate change to
    financial stability. Monthly data from 2002 to 2018 is used.
  7: "Factor analysis to integrate into China\u2019s Financial Stability Index (FS).\
    \ Bartlett test and KMO test to determine whether the sample data selected is\
    \ suitable for factor analysis. Weighted average method used to calculate China\u2019\
    s financial stability index based on variance contribution rate of each common\
    \ factor. The data period is 2002 to 2018."
  8: Vector autoregression (VAR) model is used to analyze the asymmetric impact of
    climate change on China's financial stability; Unit root tests (ADF and PP) are
    performed; Lag length criterion is used to determine the optimal lag order of
    the VAR model
  9: Two VAR models with second order lags are built for sequence TEMP_i and sequence
    TEMP_d. Unit root tests (ADF and PP) are conducted. Lag order selection is based
    on LogL, LR, FPE, AIC, SC, and HQ criteria.
  10: VAR model (for short-term effects); NARDL model (for long-term and short-term
    nonlinear and asymmetric effects); NARDL model lag order p=1 and q=1 according
    to Jeffrey (2019); Unit root test used to check data stationarity.
  11: The analysis utilizes a Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model
    to estimate asymmetric long-term coefficients between climate change and financial
    stability.
  12: NARDL (Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag) model; Cumulative sum of squares
    recursive residuals test to confirm model stability. Robustness test using carbon
    dioxide concentration as an indicator of climate change. Analysis is performed
    on monthly carbon dioxide data from NOAA.
  13: Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model. Asymmetry and co-integration
    tests are performed. Robustness tests are also conducted. First difference operator
    is used. Positive and negative partial sums are used to represent the positive
    and negative changes in climate conditions.
More Notes:
  1: Focuses on the nexus between climate change and financial stability from a nonlinear
    and asymmetric perspective.
  2: The paper aims to quantify the influence of climate change on financial stability
    and argues that addressing climate change's impact on the financial system is
    critical.
  6: The paper uses nine indicators covering financial development, macroeconomic
    situation, and the functioning of financial markets to measure China's financial
    stability. Min-Max standardization is used to process the data.
  7: Negative indicators are inverted to ensure all indicators have the same direction
    of influence on financial stability index. Average temperature data from 173 stations
    used as proxy for climate change.
  9: TEMP_i and TEMP_d are temperature variables, with TEMP_d being a second order
    lag of some temperature variable.
  10: Analysis focuses on financial stability in China.
  11: Asymmetric dynamic cumulative effect shows that after the 30th period, the impact
    of climate shocks stabilizes, reaching a long-term equilibrium.

    a negative impact on financial stability.
