Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (through changes in crop yields), socio-economic scenarios (SRES
    A1FI, A2, B1, and B2), population dynamics, and economic and political structures.
  4: Population levels and income levels (from SRES scenarios) drive future demand
    for cereals.
  6: Climate change impacts agricultural yields (specifically cereal yields).
  7: The drivers of risk are changes in climate factors impacting crop growth, including
    changes with and without CO2 effects.
  8: Climate change (implied), HadCM3 SRES B1a and B2a scenarios.
  10: Different SRES emissions scenarios and climate change.
  11: Changes in temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations under
    different SRES scenarios (A1FI, A2, B1, B2).
  12: Climate change impacts (temperature increases and precipitation decreases) under
    different SRES scenarios (A1, A2, B1, B2); varying levels of CO2 fertilization
    effects; population growth; economic development (affecting purchasing power and
    cereal demand); inequality of income.
  13: Anthropogenic climate change, SRES scenarios (A1FI, A2a, A2b, A2c, B1a, B2a,
    B2b), CO2 effects (fertilization), economic and population growth rates.
  14: Climate change impacts on crop yields, including direct effects of CO2, and
    socio-economic scenarios (SRES).
Highlights:
  1: The world, for the most part, appears to be able to continue to feed itself under
    the SRES scenarios during the rest of this century. Regional differences in crop
    production are likely to grow stronger through time, leading to a significant
    polarization of effects, with substantial increases in prices and risk of hunger
    amongst the poorer nations, especially under scenarios of greater inequality (A1FI
    and A2).
  6: Projects significant decreases in cereal yields in many parts of the world by
    the 2050s and 2080s under the specified scenarios.
  7: The analysis indicates a trend of decreasing cereal yields in many regions over
    time, with some areas experiencing initial benefits that eventually decline, while
    others face consistently negative impacts. The severity of yield reduction is
    projected to increase in the later half of the 21st century.
  8: Global trend toward greater yield reductions over time, particularly in Africa,
    South America, and Asia; limited areas in high-latitude regions showing moderate
    increases.
  10: Future reference case global cereal prices and estimates of the numbers of people
    at risk of hunger are presented for four SRES marker scenarios without climate
    change.
  11: Developing countries generally experience crop yield decreases, while developed
    countries may see increases, with Africa and Asia being particularly vulnerable
    to yield losses under higher warming scenarios. The effects of elevated CO2 can
    partially offset negative climate impacts in some regions.
  12: Climate change is likely to increase disparities in cereal yields between developed
    and developing countries; Assuming no climate change, cereal production is set
    to grow from B1800 to between B3700 and B4100 million metric tons per year by
    the 2080s depending on scenario; With no CO2 fertilization, global cereal production
    could be reduced by about 5% for B1 and B2 and 10% for A1 and A2 in the 2080s;
    CO2 fertilization effects can diminish the cereal production reductions; The number
    of people at risk of hunger is largely unaltered (at around 800 million people)
    in the A2 scenario due to income inequality, but decreases in A1, B1, and B2 due
    to increased purchasing power.
  13: Without CO2 fertilization effects, crop production responds approximately linearly
    to temperature increases. The number of people at risk of hunger is very high
    under the A2 scenario, approaching double the reference case, due to higher temperatures
    and a larger population.
  14: The world food supply system appears able to continue to feed itself under SRES
    scenarios, but regional differences in crop production are likely to grow stronger,
    leading to increased risk of hunger among poorer nations, especially under greater
    inequality scenarios (A1FI and A2).
Methodology:
  1: Crop yield results are introduced to the BLS world food trade system model. Potential
    impacts of climate change are estimated for climate change scenarios developed
    from the HadCM3 global climate model under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
    Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1FI, A2, B1, and B2. Applicable
    to the rest of this century.
  4: Uses the Basic Linked System (BLS) model, a recursive dynamic simulation that
    links national models through trade. National models contain agriculture and non-agriculture
    sectors and are driven by capital accumulation, labor force dynamics, and technical
    progress. Growth rates are harmonized with SRES scenarios.
  6: Uses the HadCM3 climate model under SRES A1FI and A2a scenarios, with and without
    CO2 effects, to project future cereal yields. Applicable to the 2020s, 2050s,
    and 2080s.
  7: The analysis uses the HadCM3 SRES A2b and A2c scenarios to project cereal yield
    changes.
  8: Climate modeling (HadCM3) under SRES B1a and B2a scenarios to project cereal
    yield changes; results applicable to the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s.
  10: The analysis uses nationally averaged yield changes for wheat, rice, maize,
    and soybean estimates in BLS simulations. HadCM3 climate change scenarios are
    used.
  11: Crop yield modeling under different SRES climate change scenarios, considering
    temperature, precipitation, and CO2 effects, with results applicable to the 2020s,
    2050s, and 2080s.
  12: The study uses SRES scenarios (A1, A2, B1, B2) and climate models (HadCM2 and
    HadCM3) to project future cereal production, prices, and hunger risk up to the
    2080s, considering factors like climate change, CO2 fertilization, population
    growth, and economic development.
  13: Uses scenarios to model the impact of climate change on cereal production, prices,
    and the number of people at risk of hunger. The risk of hunger is based on the
    number of people whose incomes allow them to purchase sufficient quantities of
    cereals.
  14: Crop yield changes are introduced into a BLS world food trade system model to
    simulate the impact of climate change on hunger risk, specifically by combining
    crop yield modelling and socio-economic scenarios.
More Notes:
  1: The paper analyzes the global consequences to crop yields, production, and risk
    of hunger of linked socio-economic and climate scenarios.
  4: The BLS model is first run for a reference case assuming no climate change for
    each SRES pathway. National economic units are aggregated into 11 broad regions.
  6: The study models the effect of CO2 fertilization on yields. The maps indicate
    a trend toward decreasing agricultural yields in many parts of the world as time
    progresses, with some regions experiencing more severe declines than others.
  7: The projections consider the influence of CO2 fertilization effects, allowing
    for comparison with scenarios without such effects.
  8: CO2 effects are considered both 'with' and 'without' in the analysis, suggesting
    an attempt to isolate the direct impacts of CO2 from other climate change effects.
  10: The effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations are considered to help
    mitigate the negative impact of climate change on crop yields. Changes in cereal
    yield are small and within historical variations by the 2020s.
  11: The analysis highlights the complex regional patterns of climate variables,
    CO2 effects, and agricultural systems. Multidecadal variability can dominate the
    climate change signal in the 2020s.
  12: The impact of climate change is considered on a global level, differentiating
    between developed and developing countries, and accounting for factors like CO2
    fertilization, population growth and purchasing power.
  14: The results are sensitive to the balance between CO2 fertilization and changes
    in climate.
