Drivers of Risk:
  1: The paper focuses on the impact of temperature on productivity.
  2: The paper focuses on weather shocks, short-term impacts, extreme events, and
    long-term climate impacts, including temperature and precipitation.
  3: Annual temperature shocks, long-run temperature levels (climate), and potentially
    precipitation (less robust evidence).
  4: Changes in annual mean temperature levels and annual total precipitation values
    (annual weather), and prevailing (historic) climate conditions (temperature) are
    considered drivers of risk.
  5: Changes in average temperature and precipitation levels.

    \ C), Annual total precipitation (m), Change in annual total precipitation (m)"

    \ (P), and changes in those variables (\u0394T, \u0394P). Lagged effects (L.)\
    \ of these changes are also considered."
  9: "Contemporaneous and lagged temperature changes (\u0394T), temperature levels\
    \ (T), precipitation changes (\u0394P), and precipitation levels (P)."

    The study focuses on the impact of global warming on GRP.
  14: "Average warming from now until then was in the order of 3.5 \u25E6 C compared\
    \ to a scenario with no additional warming from 2015 to 2019 on."

Highlights:
  1: The paper finds robust evidence that temperature affects productivity levels
    considerably. It also finds no evidence for permanent growth rate impacts. Tropical
    and poor regions are projected to have higher damages.
  3: GRP responds to annual temperature shocks as well as long-run temperature levels.
    Marginal effects of temperature increase are much higher than assumed in most
    Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). Hot regions are more strongly affected by
    further warming than cooler regions.
  4: The paper emphasizes the importance of differentiating between temperature effects
    and temperature change effects for understanding growth dynamics. It aims to test
    for different channels through which temperature and precipitation affect economic
    growth, including immediate effects of weather shocks and long-run growth effects
    of climate conditions.
  5: The long-difference model aims to disentangle transitory from permanent growth
    effects. The cross-sectional model exploits cross-sectional heterogeneity in climate
    conditions to estimate the impact on economic output, including country fixed
    effects.
  7: Find a significant negative effect of a temperature increase on GRP in annual
    panel model.
  8: "Temperature increases in hot regions (25\xB0C) significantly decrease GRP by\
    \ about 3% per 1\xB0C increase. There is evidence for direct productivity effects\
    \ of temperature shocks. There is not a clear effect of temperature levels on\
    \ the growth rate."
  9: Model with contemporaneous and lagged temperature changes has the highest explanatory
    power. Hot years might harm local economies even more than previously thought.
    No evidence found for persistent growth effects or long-run growth effects of
    climate conditions. No evidence found that a change in 10-year average temperature
    affects growth in the long-difference models. An increase in precipitation decreases
    growth, but the effect is not robust over time.
  10: "Temperature coe\uFB03cient is remarkably stable over all decades and, except\
    \ for the earliest period (1955\u20131964), signi\uFB01cant at the 10%-level.\
    \ Precipitation is not signi\uFB01cant."
  11: Temperature increases result in lower GRP in regions with high average temperatures,
    indicating a possible non-linear relationship between climate and economic output.
  12: "Regions\u2019 annual GRP is projected to decrease by 11-14% by 2099 under a\
    \ business-as-usual scenario according to panel estimates, and by 6-8% using cross-sectional\
    \ estimates."
  13: Damages inferred from the annual panel model are larger than those from the
    cross-sectional model. The interaction term in the panel approach leads to a stronger
    diversification of impacts, with cold regions potentially benefiting from warming
    while hot regions lose disproportionately. Climate damages are correlated to baseline
    GRP, with poorer regions tending to suffer stronger impacts from global warming.
  14: Red denotes highest losses (more than 20% reduction in GRP) whereas blue indicates
    that regions benefit.
  15: "Projected GRP losses are highest in poorer countries. The paper estimates a\
    \ damage function and finds that damages are considerably higher than the DICE\
    \ model for warming levels up to 9 \xB0C. The implied social cost of carbon is\
    \ significantly higher than Nordhaus's (2018) estimates."
  16: SCC estimates derived from cross-sectional results are twice as high in 2020
    as those computed in Nordhaus (2018). Finds strong evidence that output levels
    are affected after a onetime temperature increase.
  17: Short-term weather shocks have a larger effect on economic output than long-term
    climate changes, possibly due to adaptation. Technological change has not reduced
    the temperature sensitivity of economies.
  18: Changes in annual mean temperatures affect economic output in a non-linear way,
    increasing GRP in cold regions and reducing GRP in hot regions. A permanent increase
    in temperature will lead to a permanent loss in economic output in hot regions.
    Technological change has not weakened the temperature-sensitivity of economies.
Methodology:
  1: The paper employs annual panel models, long-difference regressions, and cross-sectional
    regressions using a novel dataset of subnational economic output for more than
    1500 regions in 77 countries. The results are applicable to understanding historic
    climate impacts at different time scales.
  2: The paper uses a panel of subnational GDP data (GRP) covering more than 1500
    regions, to depict local weather and climate conditions on various time scales.
    They aim to address shortcomings of previous analyses with respect to regional
    scope, temporal scale and specific technical issues.
  3: Uses panel, long-difference, and cross-sectional estimates to assess economic
    climate damages. Applies these estimates to projected greenhouse gas concentration
    trajectories to assess possible GDP losses under a business-as-usual warming scenario.
    A stylized Ramsey-type growth model is considered to illustrate economic impacts
    of climate change on different time scales, where weather variables affect the
    productivity level of the entire economy and the growth rate of labor productivity.
  4: The analysis employs an annual panel model with region-specific polynomial time
    trends, region fixed effects, and year fixed effects. It uses a regression equation
    (Eq. 6) incorporating temperature and precipitation levels and changes to model
    per-capita growth rate. Different variants of the model are considered, including
    a linear model in weather change only and a model in linear and quadratic contemporaneous
    weather variables.
  5: "Annual panel model, long-difference model, and cross-sectional model regressions\
    \ are used. The long-difference model analyzes differences between 2005-2014 and\
    \ 1995\u20132004, and between 2005-2014 and 1985\u20131994. The cross-sectional\
    \ model regresses average log GRP per capita on climate conditions over a longer\
    \ period."
  6: "The analysis uses climate and economic data at the subnational level for the\
    \ years 1900\u20132014, with some specifications restricting the sample to 1980-2014.\
    \ Climate data is from the CRU TS v3.23 dataset at 0.5-degree resolution, aggregated\
    \ to administrative regions using area-weighted averages. Temperature projections\
    \ for 2015-2099 are derived from ISIMIP."
  7: Annual panel model, long-difference model, cross-sectional model using data from
    various time periods (1985-2014).
  8: The analysis uses panel regression models with fixed effects for region and year,
    and a regional trend. Standard errors are clustered at the country level. The
    models use data from 1900-2014 or 1980-2014 and CRU weather data.
  9: Panel regressions with different cumulative lag structures, long-difference models
    (10-year periods), and cross-sectional models. The panel regressions consider
    contemporaneous and one-year lagged temperature changes. Long-difference models
    compare different 10-year periods to each other. The cross-sectional model includes
    country fixed effects and other geographic variables.
  10: "Climate and GRP data are aggregated to 10-year intervals with 2005\u20132014\
    \ as reference period. Regression analysis is performed with and without country\
    \ fixed effects and with geographical covariates."
  11: 'The analysis uses a long-difference regression model comparing two periods:
    1995-2004 to 2005-2014, and 1985-1994 to 2005-2014. It includes model variants
    with different factors such as initial GRP and uses climate data from CRU and
    ERA5.'
  12: The analysis uses cross-sectional regression to estimate a historic GRP-climate
    relationship and projects future losses based on this relationship using data
    like population and economic growth trajectories from the IPCC's Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathway 2.
  13: "The analysis uses both cross-sectional and panel regression models to estimate\
    \ the impact of climate variables on GRP. The cross-sectional analysis uses binned\
    \ climate variables (temperature in 4\xB0C steps, precipitation in 400 mm/year\
    \ steps) with geographical covariates and country fixed effects. The panel model\
    \ captures annual changes. Different weighting schemes are used to aggregate region-specific\
    \ warming and GRP losses to the global level. Results are applicable to the RCP\
    \ 8.5 warming scenario by 2099."
  14: Losses were computed based on panel regression estimate and cross-sectional
    estimate.
  15: Uses panel and cross-sectional econometric models to estimate the impact of
    warming on GRP.  Develops a reduced-form global damage function calibrated to
    match damages from panel model.  Integrates the damage functions into the DICE-2016
    model to calculate the social cost of carbon (SCC).
  16: Uses panel and cross-sectional regressions to derive damage functions that map
    temperature increases to GDP changes. Calibrates panel-based damage functions
    to replicate output- and population-weighted global damages.
  17: "Annual panel models and cross-sectional models, regression analysis.  For non-linear\
    \ annual panel speci\uFB01cations, marginal effects at 25\xB0C are given."
  18: "Stylized growth model to illustrate how weather shocks and changes in climate\
    \ conditions affect economic output and growth rates. Regression models are used\
    \ to analyze the climate\u2013growth nexus at various time scales using subnational\
    \ data with almost global coverage. Annual panel model, long-difference regression\
    \ model, and cross-sectional model on per-capita GRP are used."
More Notes:
  1: The social cost of carbon estimates exclude non-market damages and damages from
    extreme weather events or sea-level rise.
  3: The paper explicitly differentiates between short-term weather shocks and long-term
    climatic changes. The framework disregards explicit adaptation choices, damages
    to capital stocks or labor supply responses.
  4: The paper acknowledges the difficulty in clearly testing the hypotheses due to
    region-fixed effects absorbing long-term climate conditions and collinearity between
    fluctuations in temperature and changes in temperature.
  5: The paper considers various lags for temperature and precipitation in the annual
    panel model. The cross-sectional model uses a non-linear estimation approach with
    temperature and precipitation bins.
  7: Differences in mean temperature levels between Table 1 and Tables 2 and 3 are
    related to differences in spatial and temporal coverage due to missing GRP data.
  12: Precipitation impacts are disregarded due to high uncertainty in the empirical
    models.
  13: The study derives a reduced-form damage function that maps global warming to
    global GDP losses, useful for integrated assessment models.
  14: "The cross-sectional regression model implies a log-linear damage function,\
    \ giving a change in GRP by \u0398( \U0001D70Fi)\u2212 1 = ln(yi(\U0001D70Fi))\
    \ \u2212 ln \u0303yi = \U0001D6FE\U0001D70Fi, where \U0001D70Fi is the total warming\
    \ in region i, and \U0001D6FE is the estimated coefficient from the cross-sectional\
    \ model."
  15: The paper notes that a parsimonious damage function suitable for IAMs like DICE
    cannot be directly derived from their panel approach, necessitating the approximate
    reduced-form damage function. The study calibrates its damage function using surface
    area-weighted global warming to align with IAM practices.
  16: SCC estimates only include direct total factor productivity (TFP) impacts of
    changes in temperature and abstract from other climate impacts such as sea-level
    rise or non-market effects of temperature. Finds that a permanent shift in temperature
    permanently affects production levels, but there's no evidence that the long-run
    balanced growth rate of the economy is affected.
  17: "Estimates only refer to the effect of (historic) temperature and precipitation\
    \ variability on GDP, primarily covering impacts on labor productivity, land productivity,\
    \ and depreciation of capital. Non-market damages such as loss of life, con\uFB02\
    icts and violence, biodiversity and ecosystem damages, and sea level rise are\
    \ excluded."
  18: The analysis uses sub-national data, allowing for country fixed effects to avoid
    omitted variable bias in cross-sectional regressions. The paper suggests that
    current Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) may underestimate the social cost
    of carbon by neglecting annual weather shocks and uncertainty. Non-market impacts
    and costs due to sea-level rise are excluded from their damage estimates.
Quantitative material:
  1: "A 3.5\xB0C increase in global mean surface temperature would reduce global output\
    \ by 7\u201314% in 2100. The social cost of carbon from temperature-induced productivity\
    \ losses is on the order of 73\u2013142$/tCO2 in 2020, rising to 92\u2013181$/tCO2\
    \ in 2030."
  3: Marginal effects of temperature increase are higher than assumed in most Integrated
    Assessment Models (IAMs), with hot regions being more strongly affected by further
    warming.
  4: "The paper uses a regression model (Eq. 6) to quantify the impact of weather\
    \ and climate on economic growth. The coefficients \u03B1, \u03B2, \u03B31, and\
    \ \u03B32 in equation (6) are intended to quantify these impacts, with \u03B1\
    \ and \u03B2 capturing the immediate effect of weather shocks, and \u03B31 and\
    \ \u03B32 capturing transitory and long-run growth effects related to temperature\
    \ and precipitation levels."
  5: "Estimation of coefficients \U0001D6FC, \U0001D6FD, \U0001D6FE1, and \U0001D6FE\
    2 to quantify the impact of climate conditions on productivity and growth."
  6: Average annual per-capita growth in USD is 7%. The within-region standard deviation
    of growth is 3 times larger than the between-region standard deviation.
  7: Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max) for per-capita growth
    rate, annual mean temperature, change in annual mean temperature, annual total
    precipitation, and change in annual total precipitation.
  8: "Marginal effects (ME) of temperature increases on GRP are quantified. At 25\xB0\
    C, a 1\xB0C temperature increase decreases GRP by about 3% in hot regions. The\
    \ optimal annual average temperature level ranges between 5\xB0C and 10\xB0C.\
    \ Regression coefficients for various temperature and precipitation variables\
    \ are reported in Table 4."
  9: "Adding one-year lagged weather changes increases R2-adjusted and BIC considerably,\
    \ but adding more lags has only minor impacts on the two performance indicators.\
    \ In long-difference models, a 0.46\xB0C average temperature increase was observed\
    \ between 1985-1994 and 2005-2014."
  10: "One degree of temperature increase reduces GRP by 2\u20134%."
  11: "Quantitative results indicate that regions with an average temperature of 20-24\xB0\
    C have approximately 28% lower GRP compared to a reference bin, and regions with\
    \ 24-28\xB0C have 35% lower GRP. The effect of changes in precipitation shows\
    \ a u-shaped pattern but is less definitive due to large standard errors."
  12: Cross-sectional regression results show impacts of temperature changes on GRP,
    with examples like projections of around 11-14% reduction in GRP by 2099 under
    a business-as-usual scenario.
  13: Global GRP reductions in 2099 are estimated for the RCP 8.5 warming scenario,
    with reductions varying based on the weighting scheme applied (unweighted, surface
    area, GRP, population). For example, GRP reduction based on the cross-sectional
    estimate ranges from 6.6% to 8.1%, while the panel estimate ranges from 11.4%
    to 14.2%.
  14: Countries are colored according to the percentage change by which GRP would
    be reduced in 2099.
  15: "Provides an equation (12) for calculating changes in GRP based on temperature\
    \ increases. Also, \u03B2 = -0.0018 and \u03B1\u0303 = -0.035 (output-weighted)\
    \ or \u03B1\u0303 = -0.0373 (population-weighted) in a reduced-form global damage\
    \ function. Carbon prices are almost four times higher in 2020 than Nordhaus's\
    \ (2018) assessment, and 2.7-2.9 times higher in 2100."
  16: Presents a table (Table 8) with SCC estimates ($/tCO2 in 2010-US$) for different
    years (2020, 2030, 2050, 2100) based on different damage functions (DICE-2016R,
    cross-sectional estimate, panel estimate (output-weighted), panel estimate (population-weighted)).
  17: "Annual panel models: 0.8% at 10\xB0C and 3.5% at 25\xB0C temperature (preferred;\
    \ 1 lag), 0.5% at 10\xB0C and 2.6% at 25\xB0C temperature (0 lag), 2.4% at 10\xB0\
    C and 2.6% at 25\xB0C temperature (5 lags). Cross-sectional models: 2.0\u2013\
    4.3%"
  18: "A 1\xB0C temperature increase in a region with an annual mean temperature of\
    \ 25\xB0C reduces GRP by about 3.5% in that region. Projected production losses\
    \ of 7-14% in the year 2099 compared to a scenario of no further warming. Output\
    \ losses of up to 20% are possible in tropical regions."
