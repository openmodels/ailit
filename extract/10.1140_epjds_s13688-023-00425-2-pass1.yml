Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature changes impacting the economic growth effect
  3: Temperature changes
  4: Temperature and precipitation changes.
  6: Temperature and precipitation changes, including nonlinear and lagged effects,
    impacting macroeconomic outcomes.
  7: Temperature increase
  8: "Temperature rise (\u03C4 \xB0C)."
  10: "Temperature effects, specifically changes in temperature and deviation from\
    \ the optimal 15\xB0C, impact per capita GDP change."
  11: Temperature increases.
  12: "Temperature rise projections of 0.5\xB0C to 6.5\xB0C relative to 2005 levels\
    \ are considered the main driver of risk."
  13: "Temperature rise (0.5\xB0C to 6.5\xB0C relative to 2005 levels)."
  14: Temperature rise.
  17: The sample size of the training data is investigated as a potential driver of
    model performance and, by extension, the accuracy of predictions related to climate
    change impacts.
  18: Temperature changes
  19: "Temperature increases are the shocks impacting GDP growth, with scenarios analyzed\
    \ for 1\xB0C and 6\xB0C rises."
  20: "Extrapolation errors in predictions due to extreme warming scenarios impacting\
    \ economic predictions, especially with 6\xB0C warming."
  21: Temperature rise
  22: Temperature, climate change
Highlights:
  1: "Random forests have stable model performance and better prediction in bootstrapping\
    \ but underestimation occurs in 5% of cells under 6\xB0C warming"
  3: Random Forests (RFs) perform better in train-test split and stability compared
    to cubic and spline models.
  4: Temperature impacts should be included in economic projections related to climate
    change.
  7: Random Forests (RFs) exhibit superior performance compared to Decision Tree (DT),
    Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR).
  8: The paper examines the geographic distribution of temperature impacts on economic
    growth within China using cell-level data. It presents a methodology for calculating
    national GDP growth based on projected GDP changes at the cell level. Model performance
    is evaluated using standard regression metrics.
  10: "A non-linear, inverted U-shaped relationship between temperature and per capita\
    \ GDP change is observed, with growth increasing up to 15\xB0C and declining beyond."
  11: "The paper's linear simulation estimates an approximately 1% marginal change\
    \ in national GDP for each 1\xB0C warming."
  12: The paper projects national growth rates under different temperature rise scenarios
    using various statistical models. It considers the uncertainty in these projections
    and examines the impact of lagged effects.
  13: The geographical impact of temperature rise on economic growth is nonuniform.
    Northern China is projected to predominantly benefit from temperature rises. As
    temperatures rise, areas with per capita GDP growth larger than 0.6 expand from
    southern to northern and western China.
  14: "RFs predict a 1% GDP change, cubic regression predicts a -3% GDP change, and\
    \ spline regression predicts a 6% GDP change for warming below 6.5\xB0C. RFs outperform\
    \ traditional regressions in terms of R-squared, RMSE, MAE, and AIC."
  15: Random Forests (RFs) show better model performance compared to cubic and spline
    regression based on R2, RMSE, MAE, and AIC values. The study suggests that RFs
    provide more accurate predictions for both the current state and out-of-box samples.
  16: Introducing lags impacts national GDP accumulation under the temperature rise
    scenario for traditional regressions, but RFs are comparatively stable.
  17: Random Forests (RFs) have better prediction performance based on RMSE and R-squared
    values. The bandwidths in the density plot suggest a consistency of performance
    in RFs.
  18: Random Forests (RFs) have a smaller loss in explanatory power and less reduction
    in prediction accuracy compared to traditional regression methods when using train-split.
    Recommends RFs for depicting the relationship between temperature and economic
    development due to low sensitivity to sample size and stable performance.
  19: Random Forests cannot extrapolate beyond the range of the training data, leading
    to predicted GDP growth values constrained by the training sample under temperature
    rise scenarios.
  20: RFs might underestimate the negative economic impact of climate change due to
    potential information loss in heavily impacted areas.
  21: Impact of temperature on economic growth should not be ignored in economic projections.
  22: The study emphasizes the significance of incorporating temperature into economic
    projections amidst climate change. It underscores the predictive impact of machine
    learning techniques in temperature on economic growth.
Methodology:
  1: Random forests, multivariate cubic regression, and linear spline regression;
    performance comparison conducted
  2: Uses computable general equilibrium (CGE) models to compute the potential climate
    change impact to agriculture, other sectors, and the whole economy in Bulgaria.
    The temperature-economic relationship plays a critical role in estimating the
    climate change impact. Previous studies have investigated linear and nonlinear
    temperature-economic relationships via traditional regression methods by incorporating
    temperature into the Cobb-Douglas production function.
  3: Compares Random Forests (RFs) with multivariate cubic regression and linear spline
    regression. Uses 1-degree latitude by 1-degree longitude sub-national quinquennial
    variations in China over 20 years to examine the impacts of temperature on economic
    development. Suggests using marginal propensity to incorporate the impact of temperature
    into the production equation.
  4: Uses a Cobb-Douglas type production function to model the relationship between
    temperature and per capita GDP growth, with data from GEcon 4.0 and CORDEX East
    Asia project.
  6: The analysis uses CD-C models with fixed effects (cell and time), employs panel
    regressions, considers lagged effects of temperature and precipitation, and calculates
    per capita GDP growth using transformed logarithmic change.
  7: Uses Random Forests (RFs) with specific hyperparameter tuning (mtry = 989, min.node.size
    = 2, sample.fraction = 0.3142428, number of trees = 500). Also uses cubic regression
    and linear spline regression as benchmark models. Conducts a thought experiment
    considering scenarios that assume equal temperature increases among all cells.
    Uses a train-test split of 80/20.
  8: The impact of temperature on national GDP growth is computed using equation (17)
    and  geographic distribution of impacts is examined through contour maps of cell
    per capita GDP growth using the R package ggplot2. The performance of Random Forests
    regressions are evaluated using R2, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute
    Error (MAE), and Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), with equations for each are
    given (18), (19), (20).
  9: Uses Random Forests (RFs) and other regression models. Adjusts AIC for RFs due
    to challenges in determining k and L. Evaluates model performance using RMSE,
    MAE, R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and AIC.
  10: Random Forest, cubic regression, and linear spline models are used to analyze
    the impact of temperature on GDP from 1985 to 2005 in China, with cell and year-fixed
    effects and precipitation as controls.
  11: "A simple thought experiment assumes equal temperature increases among all cells\
    \ (0.5\xB0C-6.5\xB0C).  These increases and other variables are substituted into\
    \ equations to simulate per capita GDP changes in each cell, then aggregated to\
    \ obtain national GDP under temperature rise scenarios. This is compared with\
    \ actual GDP in the base year."
  12: Econometric estimates of the impact of temperature on economic growth are combined
    with temperature rise projections. Cubic models, spline models, and random forests
    (RFs) are used. The analysis considers lagged effects (2 lags) and no lags. The
    thought experiment provides solutions for estimates of the marginal impact of
    temperature on economic growth, overcoming the obstacle of using nonlinear and
    nonparametric modelling to determine marginal influences.
  13: 'Econometric estimates of the impact of temperature on economic growth combined
    with temperature rise projections. Models used: Random Forests (RFs), Cubic, and
    Spline. Analysis is performed at a cell level.'
  14: Comparison of Random Forests (RFs), cubic regression, and spline regression
    models to assess the impact of temperature rise on GDP. Models are validated using
    'out-of-box' (OOB) data. The analysis is performed on cell-level per capita GDP
    growth and national GDP.
  15: The study compares the performance of Random Forests (RFs), multiple linear
    regression (cubic), and linear spline regression (spline) models for prediction.
    It uses 80% of the data for training and 20% for out-of-box (OOB) testing.
  16: Traditional regressions (cubic and spline) and Random Forests (RFs) are used
    to model the impact of climate variables on economic outcomes. Bootstrapping is
    used to assess the accuracy and robustness of the models. Lagged effects of temperature
    and precipitation are tested with 2 lags (across 10 years).
  17: Bootstrap resampling is used to assess the robustness and stability of three
    different regression models (random forests, cubic regression, and linear spline
    regression). The performance of the models is compared using training and testing
    errors, and the impact of sample size on model performance is also evaluated using
    density plots of prediction errors.
  18: Compares Random Forests (RFs) to traditional regressions (cubic and spline)
    in depicting the relationship between temperature and economic development.  Uses
    bootstrap resampling and train/test splits to evaluate model performance. Applies
    log-first difference to remove time trends and uses ADF to confirm stationarity.
  19: The use of Random Forests, cubic regressions, and spline models to analyze the
    impact of temperature increases on predicted GDP growth.
  20: The analysis involved predictive modeling using cubic and spline regressions,
    examining out-of-range predictions. Random Forests (RFs) may mispredict due to
    extrapolation errors under extreme temperature scenarios.
  21: "A 'thought experiment' is used to compute marginal predictions of temperature\
    \ on economic development at the national level, assuming equal temperature rise\
    \ among cells (1-degree latitude by 1-degree longitude subnational quinquennial\
    \ variations) and warming from 0.5\xB0C\u20136.5\xB0C, using Random Forests (RFs),\
    \ cubic regression, and linear spline regression."
  22: Machine learning techniques are used to analyze the predictive impact of temperature
    on economic growth. Traditional models affirming the causal relationship between
    temperature and economic growth are also referenced.
More Notes:
  2: The paper discusses the limitations of quadratic and linear spline regression
    approaches in capturing the temperature-economic relationship, particularly in
    low-temperature areas. It also mentions differences in projections among different
    studies due to base-year selection, model forms, and model settings.
  3: Extrapolation poses a challenge for Random Forests (RFs) and may lead to underestimation.
    Causality remains an issue for RFs, requiring literature review and causality
    checks.
  8: "The accumulated national GDP growth in China from 2000 to 2005 was 0.6, which\
    \ is used as a contour line value. Appendix A.3 (Additional \uFB01le 1) contains\
    \ a quantile summary of the impact on GDP growth in cells."
  9: Focuses on model selection and performance measurement, particularly in the context
    of machine learning regressions and panel data analysis. Considers the trade-offs
    between different performance metrics like RMSE and MAE, and addresses the limitations
    of R-squared.
  11: The data distribution suggests a linear relationship between temperature change
    and GDP change at the national level.
  12: The paper acknowledges that the relationship between temperature and economic
    outcomes is complex and that regional and contextual factors play a crucial role.
    The simulation results are presented as a useful exercise for developing a sense
    of the temperature effects on economic development under climate change.
  13: The warming pattern assumes an equal increase in temperatures across cells,
    but the impact on economic growth varies geographically.
  14: "The optimal temperature for economic activity differs across models: approximately\
    \ 15-16\xB0C for cubic and RFs, and 21\xB0C for spline. Northern China generally\
    \ benefits from warming, while southern China experiences detrimental effects."
  15: The superior performance of RFs is partially attributed to the design of regression
    trees, their ability to capture a wide range of patterns and reoccurring patterns
    in regressors, and their capacity to diminish the influence of variable collinearity.
  16: The study finds that Random Forests perform well for predicting economic growth
    from multiple factors, including temperature.
  17: The analysis focuses on comparing the performance of different models in predicting
    an outcome, using a train-test split and bootstrapping techniques. The paper suggests
    that the size of the training dataset has an impact on model performance. The
    outcome variable itself (e.g., GDP effects, productivity loss) is not explicitly
    mentioned.
  18: RFs may result in inaccuracies in estimating the climate sensitivity of economic
    growth because of correlated time and climate variables. Overfitting, trend identification
    in time series, and absence of causality could introduce biases, uncertainties,
    and errors into the RFs model. The paper asserts a causal link between temperature
    and GDP growth.
  21: The study acknowledges that extrapolation beyond the sample temperature range
    can lead to underestimation of the overall climate change economic impact.
  22: The study uses the Geographically Scaled Economic Database (GEcon 4.0) and climate
    data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) East
    Asia project.
