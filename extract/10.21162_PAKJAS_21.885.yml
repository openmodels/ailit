Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increasing temperature, heavy rainfall, droughts, floods, and CO2 levels.
  2: "Climate change factors such as warm air, temperature, and extreme fluctuations\
    \ in precipitation would increase the CO2 concentration. During the cotton season\
    \ in Punjab and Sindh, temperature arises at 45\xB0C, sometimes exceeding 50 \xB0\
    C, which could constrain cotton productivity."
  3: Climate change variables such as average temperature and average rainfall, along
    with other inputs such as fertilizer and seed consumption are considered as potential
    drivers of risk for cotton productivity.
  5: Temperature, Rainfall, CO2 emissions, Labor, Infrastructure, Fertilizer, Seed
    consumption, Area
  6: Climate variables (average temperature, rainfall, CO2), area under cultivation,
    labor, infrastructure, fertilizer, and seed consumption.
Drivers_of_Risk:
  4: Changes in temperature, rainfall, and CO2 emissions are some factors impacting
    productivity.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change variables have a significant impact on cotton productivity in
    Pakistan; infrastructural changes positively affect cotton productivity; labor
    is negatively related to productivity; area, fertilizer, and seed consumption
    showed a significant positive effect on cotton productivity.
  2: Climate change and non-climate factors threaten cotton productivity in Pakistan,
    impacting 10% of national GDP. The study comprehensively considers climate and
    non-climate factors (labor, infrastructure, seed, and fertilizer consumption)
    affecting cotton productivity.
  3: The study analyzes the impact of various factors on cotton productivity in Pakistan,
    including climate variables and agricultural inputs, using econometric techniques
    like SFA and ARDL.
  4: Productivity and infrastructure are significant at level, while other variables
    are significant at 1st difference; temperature, rainfall, and CO2 emissions are
    key variables.
  5: There is co-integration among the variables tested (Productivity, Area, Labor,
    Temperature, Infrastructure, Fertilizer, Rainfall, CO2, and Seed consumption).
    Rainfall, infrastructure, fertilizer and seed consumption have positive impacts
    on cotton productivity. CO2 emission and labor have negative impacts. The impact
    of temperature on cotton productivity is complex, with very high temperatures
    decreasing yield but some studies showing increased production with increases
    in average temperature.
  6: Average temperature change and average rainfall have a significant positive relation
    with cotton productivity, while CO2 has a significant negative relation in Pakistan.
    Increase in labor showed a negative and significant relation with cotton productivity.
Methodology:
  1: Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model employed on time series data from
    1970 to 2018 in Pakistan; Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), co-integration
    regression estimation, and series test used for robustness.
  2: The study employs econometric models and statistical tools such as unit root
    test, autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL), and Johansen co-integration, on the
    latest available time-series data from 1971 to 2018 of Pakistan.
  3: Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) is used to decompose total factor productivity
    and measure technical efficiency. The ARDL bounds testing model is used to examine
    long-run co-integration relationships. Time series data from 1971 to 2018 is used.
  4: The analysis uses an ARDL bound testing approach to explore long-run and short-run
    relationships, with unit root testing and co-integration tests.
  5: ARDL bound cointegration test
  6: ARDL (Autoregressive Distributed Lag) model is used to examine the impact of
    climate and non-climate variables on cotton productivity in Pakistan. The analysis
    examines both long-run and short-run relationships. Stability of the model is
    assessed using CUSUM and CUSUM of Squares tests.
More Notes:
  1: The model can be generalized to all the developing countries.
  3: The analysis is restricted by data availability, excluding factors like government
    subsidies and household socio-economic status. The model examines the effect of
    various inputs on cotton production using a time series analysis.
  5: The study focuses on cotton productivity in Pakistan.
  6: Government support is vital to facilitate farmers and the agriculture sector,
    leading to sustainable growth in cotton production in the face of climate change.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Cotton productivity is affected by climate change and other factors.
  2: "Cotton-related products contribute 10% to the national GDP. Pakistan\u2019s\
    \ cotton industry is losing around 10-15% because of reasons like insufficient\
    \ irrigation water, poor traditional practices for pest infestation, low high-density\
    \ planting, old and conventional ways of resource management, resulting in low\
    \ cotton productivity."
  3: Cotton production (thousand tons) and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of cotton
    crops are examined.

  6: Cotton productivity
Outcomes_of_Interest:
  4: The study focuses on productivity in relation to macroeconomic effects.
Quantitative material:
  1: Increases in temperature and rainfall positively affected cotton productivity;
    CO2 harms cotton productivity.
  2: "Cotton-related products contribute 10% to the national GDP. Pakistan's land\
    \ supply to cotton sharply declined 14.2% to 2489 thousand hectares in 2017. Additionally,\
    \ cotton yield per hectare gradually decreased to 445 KG/HA, at the 37th position\
    \ globally. Pakistan\u2019s cotton industry is losing around 10-15%."
  3: The line graph visually illustrates changes and trends in the TFP of cotton crops
    over the period 1971-2017. The TFP mostly stays above 60% but occasionally dips
    below this threshold with drops in the early 1980s and mid-to-late 1990s.
  5: 1% increase in rainfall could increase cotton productivity by 0.29% in the long
    run and 0.33% in the short run; 1% increase in infrastructure increases cotton
    productivity by 0.48%; 1% increase in CO2 emission decreases cotton productivity
    -0.59% in the long run and -0.25% in the short run; 1 % increase in seed consumption
    can enhance cotton productivity by 0.11% in the long run and 0.008% in the short
    run; 1% Increase in fertilizer and infrastructure can enhance cotton productivity
    by 0.45% in the long run and 0.27% in the short run; 1% increase in the area would
    increase cotton productivity by 0.39% in the long run and 0.003% in the short
