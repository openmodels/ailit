Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts (e.g., water stress, increased energy costs) exacerbated
    by demographic, occupational, earnings, literacy, poverty, and government dependency
    vulnerabilities in rural communities.
  3: Climate change impacts on ecological, social, and economic systems; climatic
    variability
  11: Higher temperatures, increased CO2 levels, expansion of weeds, climate change-induced
    premature plant development, increased intensity of precipitation, warmer temperatures.
  14: Shifts in forest distribution and types, increased wildfire risk, increased
    chance of pest attacks and diseases, and adverse impacts on biodiversity.
  15: Climate change resulting in more disturbances from insects, invasive species,
    and diseases; increased frequency and intensity of mountain pine beetle attacks;
    range shifts of wild species; higher levels of atmospheric CO2
  16: Warmer winters with more sporadic freezing and thawing leading to increased
    erosion and landslides on forest roads and reduced access for winter harvesting,
    in turn increasing cost and reducing supply of forest products; Altered harvesting
    frequency and associated impacts on forest products prices; Wildfire risk due
    to higher summer temperatures and earlier spring snowmelt; Increased incidences
    of pest attacks and tree diseases; Climate change impacts on water resources resulting
    in increasing incidences of droughts, changing precipitation intensity and runoff,
    lower availability of water for irrigation, changing water demands, and lower
    water availability for energy production; limitations imposed on water supply
    by projected temperature increases; reductions in rain and snowfall; increased
    number of dry days; continued population growth stressing water supplies; more
    frequent and intense floods; changes in runoff; groundwater pumping lowering water
    tables, while rising temperatures reduce river flows
  19: Changes in availability or access to climate-sensitive resources at local, regional,
    or national levels.
  20: Climate change impacts including health risks, agricultural and forestry changes,
    water stress, and increased adverse weather events.

Highlights:
  1: Rural U.S. population is more vulnerable to climate change than urban counterparts.
    Climate change impacts differ across regions and economic sectors.
  11: Climate change may increase agricultural production costs, particularly through
    weed expansion and decreased herbicide efficacy.  Corn yields have shown an upward
    trend even in light of variation caused by climate events.
  14: Potential habitats for trees favored by cool environments are likely to shift
    north.
  15: Damage from pests like the Southern Pine Beetle can lead to annual losses exceeding
    1% of a state's gross product.
  16: The effect of climate change on forest dependent communities will vary regionally;
    Wildfire risk is expected to be most severe in the Southwest and Northwest; rural
    communities in the Southwest and engaged in activities like farming are expected
    to experience additional water stress due to climate change.
  19: Climate change will affect rural communities, requiring mitigation and adaptation
    actions.
  20: The study highlights the greater vulnerability of rural communities to climate
    change and the need for public-policy interventions.
  24: No relevant information
Methodology:
  1: Extensive review of current knowledge on climate change impacts on rural communities
    in the US, making inferences based on IPCC scenarios. Focus is on identifying
    vulnerabilities rather than precise economic modeling.
  3: Insights from existing knowledge sources (peer-reviewed journal articles, government
    reports, and websites) are used to discern climate change impacts on rural communities.
    Inferences are based on Global Climate Models (GCMs) under three SRES (Special
    Report on Emissions Scenarios) namely relatively low (B1), high (A2), and even
    higher (A1F1) emission trajectories. Inferences are drawn only when change climate
    variable trends can be established in particular region through all three emission
    scenarios projections. Inferences are not drawn when there is divergence among
    these three scenarios projections.
  15: No specific methodology discussed, but the analysis appears to be based on existing
    literature and predictive models.
  19: Regional case study approach at different spatial scales (national, regional
    and local); Integrating the adaptation insights of indigenous peoples.
  20: The analysis suggests the need for a suite of adaptation and mitigation policy
    options, dialogue among stakeholders, and regional studies.

More Notes:
  1: The paper identifies a gap in literature specifically addressing the impact of
    climate change on rural communities in the United States.
  14: The changing forest distribution is already being observed in many areas (e.g.,
    aspen advancing into spruce-fir forests in Colorado, lodgepole pine advancing
    into black spruce zones in the Yukon).
  19: The paper focuses on the impact of climate change on rural communities and potential
    mitigation and adaptation strategies. It highlights the importance of understanding
    ecosystem services, utilizing alternative energy sources, and increasing stakeholder
    involvement in policy processes.
  20: The focus is primarily on adaptation in rural communities, emphasizing research-policy
    linkages and expanding alternative energy sources to enhance adaptive capabilities.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Impacts of climate change on rural communities' economic activities, including
    agriculture and forestry.
  3: Increased risk and uncertainty of forest and agricultural production; alteration
    in productivity for crops and forest products; changes in supply of ecosystem
    goods and services; altered cost of utilities and services.
  11: Climate change may increase agricultural production costs.
  14: Impacts on rural communities will vary depending on geography, demographics,
    and social and economic conditions, with some benefiting while others lose.
  15: Annual losses from Southern pine beetle have reached over 1% of gross state
    product in some US states.
  16: Loss of employment for many rural communities due to a contracting forest industry.
  19: Increased investment in rural areas; Rural job creation; Improved rural economy;
    Improved rural quality of life.

    costs and capacity in rural communities.
