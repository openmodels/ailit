Drivers of Risk:
  8: Breakdowns in regional cooperation and global institutions (UK-SSP3); Rapid and
    unmanaged urbanization (UK-SSP3); Increased societal vulnerabilities (UK-SSP3);
    Reliance on fossil fuels (UK-SSP5); Resource disparities widening between the
    wealthy and those with limited access (UK-SSP4).
Highlights:
  8: UK-SSPs provide locally comprehensive scenarios, showing the interactions between
    challenges to mitigation and adaptation under different socio-economic conditions.
Methodology:
  8: Scenario analysis using UK-specific Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (UK-SSPs) developed
    through a participatory process, consistent with global and European SSPs; scenarios
    are applicable to 2070s.
More Notes:
  8: The paper focuses on water abstraction trends under different UK-SSP scenarios,
    linking them to agricultural practices, technological innovation, and energy mix.
    Stakeholder confidence in water abstraction trends in UK-SSP5 was low due to divergent
    projections depending on the dominant water demand sector.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  8: Economic losses result from lack of access to consistent services in UK-SSP3.
Quantitative material:
  8: No quantitative information.
