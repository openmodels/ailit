Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Demographic and economic projections developed in the context of the Intergovernmental\
    \ Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Shared Socioeconomic Pathways."
  5: Climate change (implicitly through SSP scenarios), demographic trends, education
    levels, trade policy
  6: Different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) reflecting varying assumptions
    about population, fertility, and socioeconomic development.
Highlights:
  1: Differences in poverty headcount and poverty rates across scenarios are largest
    for Sub-Saharan Africa; the most optimistic scenario implies over 300 million
    individuals living in extreme poverty in 2030.
  5: Poverty projections integrated with climate and demographic trends; assessment
    of the potential returns of investments in education in terms of poverty reduction;
    analysis of the impact of trade policy on poverty reduction.
  6: Poverty headcount and rate vary significantly across SSPs and continents; Africa
    faces the highest poverty levels across all SSPs.
Methodology:
  1: "An econometric tool that combines country-specific historical estimates of the\
    \ distribution of income (Beta\u2013Lorenz curves) with projections of population\
    \ changes (by age and education attainment) and GDP projections to provide poverty\
    \ projections."
  5: Combines GDP forecasts from IMF with income projections from SSP scenarios using
    models by Dellink et al. (2017) and Crespo-Cuaresma (2017); reconstructs income
    distribution using PovCal and other databases; projects poverty using a dynamic
    model linked to the World Poverty Clock.
  6: "Estimation of poverty headcount ratios is done using country-specific Beta\u2013\
    Lorenz curves."
More Notes:
  1: The study suggests that fulfilling the first SDG (Sustainable Development Goal)
    will be difficult without further development policy efforts.
  5: The paper uses SSP scenarios to project poverty, implying that macroeconomic
    and fiscal risks related to climate change are indirectly incorporated through
    the assumptions of these scenarios. Focus is on poverty reduction, but the model
    also considers GDP, productivity, and demographic factors.
  6: The analysis abstracts from business cycle effects to focus on low-frequency
    changes in poverty.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Poverty rates worldwide and absolute poverty changes at the global level.
  5: Poverty headcount
  6: Poverty headcount and poverty rate
Quantitative material:
  1: Worldwide poverty rates ranging from 4.5% (around 375 million persons) to almost
    6% (over 500 million persons) by the end of the projection period (2030).
  5: Poverty projections for 2017 and 2030 under the SSP2 scenario, categorized by
    poverty status (no extreme poverty, off-track, rising poverty)
  6: Table 1 provides poverty headcount (in millions) and poverty rate (in parenthesis)
    by continent and SSP scenario for 2030.
