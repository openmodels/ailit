Drivers of Risk:
  2: Natural disasters, temperature, and precipitation variations impact migration.
  3: Temperature and precipitation changes are impacting migration patterns; natural
    disasters such as landslides, earthquakes, and floods also have various effects.
  4: "Temperature increases affecting agriculture productivity and economic output\
    \ across sectors, especially above 25 \xB0C."
  5: Temperature increase and precipitation changes.
  6: Temperature increases and natural disasters (floods, volcanoes, landslides, and
    earthquakes).
Highlights:
  2: Household migration in Indonesia due to climatic variations and disasters tends
    to be permanent, rather than temporary or short-distance.
  3: "Turning point above 25 \xB0C for temperature effect on migration; below this,\
    \ temperature decreases migration; landslides consistently have a positive effect\
    \ on migration."
  4: "Temperature has a significant nonlinear effect on the value of household assets,\
    \ with critical thresholds around 24 \xB0C impacting migration and economic effects."
  5: The study finds a strongly nonlinear effect of temperature on permanent migration,
    with a smaller impact of sudden disasters relative to climate variations.
  6: At initially higher levels of temperature, permanent migration of households
    is influenced by a further increase in temperature. Temperature likely influences
    migration through its impact on local economic conditions.
Methodology:
  2: Uses household panel data and a difference-in-differences approach to study migration
    due to climatic variations and disasters; empirical model predicts migration probability
    based on temperature, precipitation, and disaster data.
  3: Uses heteroskedasticity-robust SEs and multidimensional clusters for correlations;
    household-level data is collapsed to province-year level to account for spatial
    and temporal autocorrelation.
  4: Empirical model analyzing the effect of climate and disaster variables on household
    assets as a proxy for wealth/income.
  5: Quadratic model for the temperature effect and assumption of the same temperature
    sensitivity of migration in the future as now, based on CMIP3 model output.
  6: The study uses a household panel survey (IFLS) with four waves (1993, 1997, 2000,
    and 2007) to construct records of whole-household migration flows over three time
    periods. The study uses data on natural disasters from the DesInventar database
    and province-level measures of average annual precipitation and average temperature
    derived from the University of Delaware. Logarithmic transformations are applied
    to disaster variables.
More Notes:
  2: The study uses data from Indonesia due to its vulnerability to climate variations
    and natural disasters; various measures are used to assess disaster impact, including
    number of deaths and economic losses.
  3: Study discusses spatial autocorrelation due to ENSO events and adjusts for it
    in analysis; results seen as conservative due to sample size reduction.
  4: Temperature is a dominant factor affecting migration, potentially through its
    impact on household economic conditions.
  5: The study analyzes the migration response to the highly variable period-to-period
    temperature and not just the entire long-term trend in temperature.
  6: Indonesia's tropical climate, high dependence on agriculture, and strong culture
    of interprovincial migration may particularly increase the effect of temperature
    on interprovincial migration.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: No specific macroeconomic outcomes or fiscal outcomes are mentioned on this page.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Annual economic growth reduced by as much as 1.1% points for each degree increase
    in annual temperature.
  5: Potential magnitude of climate-related migration for the country as a whole.
  6: Permanent migration of households.
Quantitative material:
  2: No specific quantitative information on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes is given.
  3: "Evidence that above 25 \xB0C, outmigration increases nonlinearly with temperature;\
    \ at 1 \xB0C increase from 26 \xB0C to 27 \xB0C increases the annual probability\
    \ of migration by 0.008."
  4: "A 1 \xB0C increase in temperature at higher levels results in significant reductions\
    \ in household asset value, with specific thresholds: 14-15% at 25 \xB0C, and\
    \ 28-31% at 26 \xB0C."
  5: "Predicted change in annual outmigration probability under projected low- and\
    \ high-temperature increase for sampled provinces (Table S4); for example, provinces\
    \ starting around 26 \xB0C show increase in outmigration probability varying from\
    \ 0.02 to 0.03, whereas provinces with a starting temperature at \u223C 24 \xB0\
    C, are likely to see no increase in outmigration."
