0,Industrial GDP,Sub-Saharan Africa,Not specified,2000,No CC,Statistically significant,-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Page 23,"Industrial GDP is negatively affected by moderate and severe droughts, attributed to reduced hydroelectricity and upstream effects of poor agricultural production. Positive association with precipitation suggests benefits from hydroelectricity or agricultural inputs."

4,Poverty,Sub-Saharan Africa,Drought shock,2001,No shock,Percentage increase,0,NA,99%,NA,NA,NA,27,"Severe drought was strongly associated (99% CI) with increasing poverty counts. Dercon (2001) found rainfall shocks were the primary reason households fell into poverty. The value of '0' is only included as a placeholder, due to the lack of a specific numeric estimate in the provided text."
