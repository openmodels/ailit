Drivers of Risk:
  2: Flooding events (specifically Hurricane Sandy), flood insurance (NFIP participation),
    community risk perception
  3: Hurricane Sandy and community perceptions of flood risk are impacting coastal
    housing prices.
  4: Flooding from storm surge, riverine, and pluvial sources during different seasons,
    along with historical reference to storm events such as Hurricane Sandy.
  5: Flooding events, driven by surge and rainfall, impact the perceptions of flooding
    risk and housing policies.
  6: Flooding, particularly Hurricane Sandy, and community perceptions of flood risk
    drive changes in housing prices.
  7: Flooding (including compound flooding events, variations in community exposure
    and resilience, perceptions of flooding, and governance) and predictions of changes
    to the flooding regime.
  8: Flooding losses and perceptions of risk (influenced by NFIP participation) are
    the main drivers impacting housing prices.
  9: Floods are identified as the primary driver impacting housing prices and influencing
    future flood losses.
Evaluation overview:
  2: Housing values (HPs) and economic recovery for communities
  5: This page evaluates the impact of flooding on the perceptions of flooding and
    housing density, focusing on housing prices.
  6: Housing prices (HPs) and community perceptions of flooding are evaluated.
  7: Housing prices are being evaluated in response to flooding.
  8: This paper evaluates housing price (HP) changes in response to flooding and NFIP
    participation.
  9: The analysis examines the impact of floods on future housing prices (HPs) and
    how these feedback into future flood loss projections.
Highlights:
  2: The initial economic impact of Hurricane Sandy was largely absorbed by the National
    Flood Insurance Program (NFIP); however, the region then exhibited a long-term
    decline in home values.
  3: Recent changes in coastal housing prices have been driven more by perceptions
    of risk rather than actual hazard regimes.
  4: Historical peak in NFIP flood losses in 2012 due to Hurricane Sandy, with 75,247
    claims and $4.86 billion reported losses.
  5: The adaptation of models to include time-varying factors showed improved simulation
    performance in the study region.
  6: The ITS model provided the most accurate representation of flooding dynamics
    across the study region. There was a clear drop in relative HPs after Hurricane
    Sandy. State-level variations in the relationships between model parameters describing
    flood risk perceptions and HP dynamics are evident.
  7: The region is likely to experience more frequent flooding and economic loss.
    Changes to the flooding regime may result in sustained decreases in property values.
  8: NFIP participation may have shielded the housing market from immediate economic
    loss but also conditioned housing values on perceived risks. Housing values are
    driven more by perceptions and NFIP participation than actual changes to flood
    hazards. There may be regional perceptions of risk decoupled from actual risk.
  9: The study finds the Immediate Threshold Shift (ITS) recovery model best captures
    flood dynamics; post-Hurricane Sandy, while NFIP absorbed initial impacts, a sustained
    decline in housing values was noted.
Methodology:
  2: Used a socio-environmental (SE) model and an interrupted time series model.
  3: The study uses a socio-environmental (SE) model focused on 496 coastal census
    tracts in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, considering community perceptions
    and housing prices.
  4: Utilization of a SE model to simulate flood dynamics concerning economic losses,
    population density, community flood awareness, and flood preparedness.
  5: "The paper describes a modified SE model and three competing time-varying HP\
    \ models (sigmoid, ITS, and K-shaped recovery) to evaluate flooding impact, using\
    \ data from 1970\u20132021 for calibration."
  6: An SE model is integrated with housing models to explore relationships between
    housing market values, external flooding hazards, and perceptions of future risk.
    Spearman's ranked correlation is used to examine relationships between model parameters.
  7: The study utilizes a Sigmoid Recovery Model, an Interrupted Time Series (ITS)
    model, and a K-shaped recovery model to simulate housing prices and compare them
    to actual data. The SE (Socio-Ecological) model is also mentioned.
  8: The analysis uses calibrated SE model parameters and correlation plots to assess
    the relationships between NFIP participation, flood awareness, and housing prices
    across census tracts in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut. The results are
    applicable to the study region and time period considered in the broader paper.
  9: A socio-economic (SE) model incorporating precipitation, storm surge flood hazards,
    and various housing price response scenarios is used to assess flood impacts.
More Notes:
  2: Tracts with greater post-flood change in active insurance policies exhibited
    larger decreases in mean home values than those with more stable NFIP participation.
  6: The study region experienced a steady increase in HPs from 1970 to 2012, which
    may have been temporarily slowed by minor flood events.
  7: The study emphasizes the complex relationship between flood risk and community
    perceptions, requiring tools that consider the interactions between these processes.
Quantitative material:
  2: Studied the temporal impacts of flooding on mean housing values across 496 coastal
    census tracts of New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey, US, from 1970 to 2021.
  4: Average annual NFIP flood insurance claims of 3,476 with an average annual claim
    total of $112 million.
  5: The Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) metrics are used to measure the correlation
    between simulated and observed losses, population density, and awareness due to
    flooding events.
  6: Parameters b2 and b3 control initial drop in HPs due to flooding and the rate
    of HP recovery, respectively.
  7: The SE model suggests that the immediate negative consequences of an isolated
    intense flooding event may continue to be absorbed by the NFIP.
  8: The correlation plots (Figure 4) present quantitative information on the relationships
    between preparedness, memory of past floods, decay rates of precautionary measures,
    and housing price changes across different states. Significance levels (p < 0.05,
    p < 0.01, p < 0.001) are indicated.
