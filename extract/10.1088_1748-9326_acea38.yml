Drivers of Risk:
  2: The salience of past flooding events and NFIP participation are suggested as
    important regional drivers of housing prices, with tracts experiencing greater
    post-flood changes in active insurance policies showing larger decreases in mean
    home values.
  4: Flood hazards (high surge elevations, extreme rainfall).
  7: Changes to the flooding regime
  8: Flood awareness and memory of past floods impact housing market values, potentially
    through changes in NFIP policy participation.
  9: Precipitation and storm surge flood hazard; community perceptions; memory of
    past flooding; NFIP participation.
Highlights:
  2: The initial economic impact of Hurricane Sandy was largely absorbed by the National
    Flood Insurance Program, but the region exhibited a long-term decline in home
    values.
  4: Flood events cause community flood awareness (A) and preparedness (P) to increase,
    and population density (D) to decrease.
  7: Predicted changes to the flooding regime may result in sustained decreases in
    property values.
  8: Increases in NFIP participation correlate with perceived increased risks, which
    may drive down housing values over time.
  9: The immediate impact of 2012 Hurricane Sandy on the housing market was largely
    absorbed by the NFIP, but the region experienced a sustained decline in housing
    values afterwards.  There are significant correlations between model parameters
    representing changes in housing values post-floods and those describing community
    behavior and perceptions.  Simulating time-varying housing prices improved the
    representation of NFIP losses and policy uptake.
Methodology:
  2: A socio-environmental model was used to study the temporal impacts of flooding
    on mean housing values across 496 coastal census tracts of New York, Connecticut,
    and New Jersey, demonstrating results from 1970 to 2021.
  4: An SE model is used to study relationships between housing price (HP) dynamics
    and community awareness of flooding, simulating annual economic losses (L), population
    density (D), community flood awareness (A), and flood preparedness (P) based on
    a time series of peak annual flood hazards.
  7: The study developed a SE model to assess consequences of flooding.
  8: Analysis is based on correlation plots using calibrated statistical models, examining
    the relationship between flood awareness, NFIP participation, and housing market
    values.
  9: 'Developed a Socio-Economic (SE) model to assess the impact of floods on future
    HPs, which then feedbacks to the estimate of future flood loss. The model incorporates
    both precipitation and storm surge flood hazard and includes four HP response
    scenarios: (1) a model assuming no impact, and models assuming initial losses
    followed by (2) a sigmoid recovery, (3) an ITS recovery, and (4) a K-shaped recovery.
    The ITS recovery model best captured flooding dynamics in the study region.'
More Notes:
  7: The coastal communities of the study region remain highly vulnerable to flooding
    under climate change; Regional precipitation will likely be characterized by more
    intense rainfall interspersed with extended droughts; The region is likely to
    experience more frequent flooding and economic loss.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  4: "The SE model simulates annual economic losses (L) based on peak annual flood\
    \ hazards (W), housing density (D), and a hazard to loss ratio (\u03B2R)."
  7: Property values are impacted by flooding.
  8: Participation in flood insurance affects housing market values, which indirectly
    influences perceptions of economic risk.
  9: Impact of floods on future house prices (HPs), which then feeds back to the estimate
    of future flood loss; socio-economic disparities in flood risk related to home
    value; capacity for communities to recover; NFIP losses and policy uptake.
Quantitative material:
  4: From 1979 to 2021, the average annual number of flood insurance claims submitted
    through NFIP in this region was 3,476 claims per year with an average annual claim
    total of $112 million.
  7: NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program) absorbs immediate negative consequences
    of flooding; flooding insurance claims between 1970 and 2020 are plotted; Sigmoid,
    ITS, and K-shaped recovery models display simulated vs. actual housing prices;
    Error bars represent variability or uncertainty in observed data.
  9: The immediate impact of 2012 Hurricane Sandy on the housing market was largely
    absorbed by the NFIP; significant correlations between model parameters representing
    changes in housing values post-floods and those describing community behavior
    and perceptions; census tracts with greater change in insurance uptake following
    floods witnessed larger decreases in mean home values compared to those with more
    stable NFIP participation.
