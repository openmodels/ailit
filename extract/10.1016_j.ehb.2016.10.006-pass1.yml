Drivers of Risk:
  1: Droughts and increasing purchase prices.
  2: Natural shocks (climate variability, droughts), non-natural shocks (international
    food prices), environmental problems, national macroeconomic responses.

    as major shocks impacting child health.
  4: Droughts, increasing purchase prices (food prices)
  7: Droughts and floods are the hazards that have most affected the Senegalese population
  9: Price increases, droughts, crop pests, loss of key income source, extreme cold
    events. The paper focuses on drought and increasing prices.

Highlights:
  1: Senegal is very vulnerable to climate variability and international price developments.
  2: Vulnerability to climate variability is high in Senegal due to reliance on natural
    resources and subsistence agriculture; international food price peaks exacerbate
    the situation.
  3: Drought and income/price shocks have the most adverse effects on child health,
    but there were structural improvements in 2011 in child anthropometrics due to
    broadly applied food and agricultural programs.
  4: Droughts and price shocks negatively affect child health, particularly for poor
    farming households. Multiple shocks have interdependencies that must be carefully
    dealt with.
  7: Households are expected to be most adversely affected by price and drought shocks.
  9: An increase in purchase prices is the adverse event that has mostly affected
    rural households in Senegal. Droughts are positively and significantly correlated
    with the occurrence of crop pests, loss of a key income source, and price variations
    in 2009. Drought and increasing prices are not significantly correlated in 2011,
    indicating they are exogenous to each other.
  14: The concomitance of increased prices and drought shocks has a positive but insignificant
    effect on child weight-for-age, suggesting competing price and income effects
    could mitigate the severity of individual shocks.
  16: Droughts and price increases have a pronounced negative impact on child health
    in the short run. Interdependencies of shocks can lead to offsetting effects.
    Households that depend on agriculture and asset-poor households are most adversely
    hit by the shocks.
  17: Growing up in poor shock-prone environments does not necessarily preclude child
    opportunities to develop. Positive income effects from concomitant price and drought
    shocks for children in rural households are possible. Effects on urban children
    and households are expected to be very different from rural households.
  20: No relevant information
  24: Significant increase in purchase prices and loss of key income sources in 2011
    compared to 2009; drought and death of a member also increased with noted significance.
  25: Drought has a statistically significant negative impact on child weight-for-age.
    Increase in purchase prices and death of a household member has a statistically
    significant positive impact on child weight-for-age. There is a statistically
    significant interactive effect of Year 2011 and increased prices, and Year 2011
    and drought.
  26: Drought has a statistically significant negative impact on the outcome variable
    in the intensity specification. Loss of key income source has a statistically
    significant impact, with negative coefficient in the HH.SPI3 specification. Death
    of a household member has a statistically significant positive impact (in the
    HH.SPI3 specification). There is also some evidence of interaction effects between
    the year 2011, drought, and increased prices.
  28: Drought negatively impacts households cultivating peanuts with farming as the
    main occupation; increased purchase prices negatively impact households when interacted
    with drought; death of a household member positively impacts households where
    the male breadwinner is farming.
  29: Drought has a statistically significant negative impact on asset-poor households.
    Crop pests have a statistically significant negative impact on asset-rich households.
    Loss of key income source has a statistically significant negative impact on asset-poor
    households. Year 2011 * Increased Prices has a statistically significant negative
    impact on asset-poor households. Year 2011 * Drought has a statistically significant
    negative impact on asset-poor households.
  30: Drought has a statistically significant negative impact on girls (columns 8
    and 9, -0.700*** and -0.708*** respectively). Extreme cold has a statistically
    significant positive impact on boys (columns 8-11), and loss of key income source
    has a statistically significant negative impact on boys (columns 8-11). Some interaction
    terms of drought, increased prices and year are statistically significant for
    girls.
Methodology:
  1: Employs a dataset of children in rural Senegal in 2009 and 2011 and accounts
    for structural changes between survey periods. Multi-shock approach.
  2: Multi-shock framework for the case of rural Senegal at the micro-level.
  3: Analysis is based on a repeated cross-section of children measured in rural Senegal
    during a household survey after the 2011 food price spike, utilizing a rich shock
    module for vulnerability analysis.
  4: Empirical analysis based on an inter-temporal utility model with income uncertainty,
    controlling for access to markets, child health history, and farming decisions.
    Robustness checks including geo-referenced precipitation data.
  7: Household survey carried out in eight regions of Senegal
  9: The analysis uses self-reported survey shock data, sub-sample analyses, and probit
    models to investigate the determinants of reported increases in purchase prices.
    Correlation analyses between different shock categories are performed for 2009
    and 2011.
  14: Analysis includes regression specifications with interaction terms to evaluate
    effects of price and drought shocks, using child, household, and village observables
    with survey year as controls.
  16: Multiple shock analysis for the case of rural Senegal. Robustness checks include
    comparing different sub-samples (farmers vs. non-farmers, asset-poor vs. asset-rich,
    boys vs. girls).
  17: Analysis of shock effects on children in rural households, policy recommendations
    for short-term interventions and long-term structural change.
  20: No relevant information
  21: "The data is from Agence Nationale de Statistique et de la D\xE9mographie (AGNSD,\
    \ 2013) and authors\u2019 elaborations."
  23: Descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) are calculated for rural
    households in Senegal in 2009 and 2011, and the differences between the two years
    are tested for statistical significance. The study focuses on rural households
    in Senegal, results are applicable to similar contexts.
  24: Analysis through comparative statistics of shock incidence over two survey periods
    (2009, 2011) and correlation analysis between different shocks.
  25: Village-year fixed effects estimations with standard errors clustered at the
    village level, using dummy variables for shock events. Additional control variables
    are included.
  26: 'Fixed effects estimations with clustered standard errors are used. Village-year
    or Region fixed effects are included. Two specifications are presented: one using
    perceived intensity of the shocks on a Likert scale and another using the Standardized
    Precipitation Index (SPI3) for drought. The time frame is likely to include the
    year 2011, as there are interaction terms with ''Year 2011''.'
  28: Village-year fixed effects estimations with standard errors clustered at the
    village level; includes dummy variables for various shocks and additional control
    variables.
  29: Village-year fixed effects estimations with standard errors clustered at the
    village level, using dummy variables for shocks and controlling for various demographic
    and asset-related variables. Significance levels at 10/5/1%. Results applicable
    to the specific context (likely a developing country) and time period from which
    the data was collected.
  30: Village-year fixed effects estimations with standard errors clustered at the
    village level are used. The sample is split into boys and girls. Additional control
    variables are included. The results are applicable for the dataset used in the
    study.
More Notes:
  1: Focuses on the micro level, specifically child health (weight-for-age). The analysis
    suggests that the impact of shocks can be mitigated by increases in rural household
    income.
  2: The paper aims to understand the impact of environmental and price shocks on
    subsistence agriculture, accounting for international price developments and national
    macroeconomic responses.
  3: The analysis emphasizes the concomitant effect of environmental and economic
    shocks on child health, particularly in developing regions.
  4: The analysis focuses on Senegalese country context. Higher prices for home-produced
    goods can increase income for net producers, especially during droughts. Risk
    aversion is assumed, and consumption is analyzed in relation to idiosyncratic
    shocks.
  7: The study focuses on the impact of shocks on child health (weight-for-age Z-score)
    in rural Senegal, using data from 2009 and 2011.
  9: The reference period for shock variables (January-June) is not the key drought
    period for Senegal, but lean season droughts may still affect agricultural production
    and food scarcity. The more sensitive perception of negative events in 2011 is
    attributed to the overall hazardous climate induced by high food prices.
  16: Income effects dominate concomitant drought and price shocks for poor subsistence
    farmers. The paper suggests that the poor are highly dependent on agricultural
    land and its yields, which are vulnerable to environmental and economic shocks.
  17: The study focuses on the impact of shocks on children and household welfare,
    particularly in rural areas, and emphasizes the need for policy interventions
    to mitigate negative effects and build resilience.

  25: The data covers 165 villages with a total of 3,810 observations. The study controls
    for various factors like child age and gender, household head characteristics,
    mother characteristics, land ownership, asset ownership, and access to services.
  26: The table is from an online appendix and presents robustness checks. The dependent
    variable is not explicitly stated, but is likely household-level wellbeing.

    cold, crop pest, price changes, loss of income, death of a household member) on
    an unspecified outcome variable at the household level. Given the note that it
    explores perceived intensity on a scale from 1 to 10, it is likely that the outcome
    of interest relates to an household-level measure of wellbeing (for example, a
    measure of household welfare, consumption or food security).
