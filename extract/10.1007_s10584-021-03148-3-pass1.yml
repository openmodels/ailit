Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climatic heat hazard (under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and socio-economic vulnerability
    (using different SSP scenarios).
  8: Rising temperatures are the main driver of increased heat-related mortality risk.
  10: The drivers of risk are related to climate change hazards (heat) combined with
    exposure projections (population density in postal code areas) and socio-economic
    pathways (SSPs and EUSSPs) that influence vulnerability.
  11: Socio-economic scenarios influence heat-related risk more than climate alone,
    with factors like temperature increase and socio-economic changes being significant
    drivers.
Highlights:
  1: Projections of vulnerability have a considerable impact on future heat-related
    risk. Heat hazard increases notably in RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, but a decrease of vulnerability
    especially in SSP1 and SSP5 alleviates risks. Assessments should include the combination
    of long-term climatic and socio-economic projections.
  8: Heat-related vulnerability projections for 2050 show a decrease in vulnerability
    in all scenarios compared to the current situation, although there are differences
    between SSP scenarios.
  10: The highest risk areas are the centres of major cities, especially Helsinki,
    and some rural areas in south-eastern Finland, and this pattern is relatively
    stable regardless of the number of indicators considered.
  11: Socio-economic factors can either amplify or mitigate heat-related risks, with
    SSPs having varied impacts under different RCP scenarios.
Methodology:
  1: 'Projects a vulnerability index for Finland to evaluate differences in heat vulnerability
    projections with different scenarios and scales, and how socio-economic scenarios
    influence heat risk assessments. It uses three different scenario sets for vulnerability:
    global SSPs, European SSPs (EUSSPs) at the sub-national scale (NUTS2), and EUSSPs
    aggregated at the national scale. Projections of heat risk are constructed utilizing
    climatic heat hazard data and vulnerability and exposure data.'
  8: The study calculates the number of days per year in each of the four temperature
    intervals (specified in Quantitative Material) averaged over 5 years based on
    climate projections (RCPs) from 2010 to 2100 and weights them to estimate hazard.
    They use temperature-mortality relationships, spatially averaged temperature data,
    population density projections and downscaling techniques, and normalize data
    with z-scores.
  10: Vulnerability maps are created at the postal code scale using global SSPs, EUSSPs,
    and EUSSPs based on national values, comparing changes in vulnerability deciles.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on Finland. The vulnerability index is constructed for the
    year 2050. The study utilizes SSPs to represent socio-economic changes.
  8: The study focuses on Finland and uses data specific to Finnish regions to determine
    temperature-mortality relationships.
  10: The analysis uses different SSP scenarios to project future vulnerability. The
    use of national versus regional socio-economic data impacts the vulnerability
    projections.

    \ temperature are associated with increases in daily relative mortality of 1.1%,\
