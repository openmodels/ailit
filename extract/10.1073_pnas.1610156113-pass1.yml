Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change impacting tree growth; Seasonal temperature, soil moisture, and
    atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO2]) variation.
  4: Soil moisture sensitivity, temperature increases, climatic drying trends, hydroclimatic
    variability.
  5: Climate variation (temperature, soil moisture), wildfires, insect outbreaks,
    disturbances, and atmospheric CO2.
Highlights:
  2: "Species and regions show different long-term growth trends in Canadian boreal\
    \ forests; Averaged across Canada\u2019s boreal forest, growth did not change\
    \ significantly (P > 0.050) from 1950 to 2002; Reasonable agreement between growth\
    \ trends estimated from tree rings and trends estimated by NDVI across a large\
    \ portion of Canada\u2019s forested area during the overlapping period of 1982\u2212\
    2002."
  4: "Sensitivity of Canada\u2019s boreal forest to soil moisture during the second\
    \ half of the 20th century is striking."
  5: There is no overarching 'growth enhancement' or 'growth decline' in recent years,
    but significant regional- and species-related trends in growth exist; hydroclimatic
    variability impacts on growth have intensified late in the 20th century.
Methodology:
  2: "Analysis based on tree ring width measurements from 2,807 trees at 598 ground\
    \ plots from Canada\u2019s National Forest Inventory (NFI); Growth trends before\
    \ and during satellite era are compared with trends observed from NDVI datasets;\
    \ Ring width series were scaled to provide annual estimates of tree basal area\
    \ increments (BAIs); detrended using species-by-plot generalized additive mixed\
    \ models (GAMMNFI), a tree-level generalized negative exponential (GNE) procedure,\
    \ and two uniform species-by-ecozone procedures."
  4: Tree-ring measurement series, plot-level and ecozone-level generalized additive
    mixed models (GAMMNFI and GAMMeco), generalized negative exponential (GNE) procedures,
    and regional curve standardization (RCS).
  5: Analysis of tree-ring data from Canada's National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots,
    correlation analysis of forest growth (BAI) with climate data and remotely sensed
    NDVI, mixed models to assess climate and CO2 effects.
More Notes:
  2: The study uses data from Canada's National Forest Inventory (NFI) plots, representing
    more than 400 Mha, and covers eight of its terrestrial ecozones.
  4: The study focuses on species-by-ecozone forest growth variability assessed from
    tree-ring measurement series.
  5: The study suggests elevated atmospheric CO2 is a large-scale, but subtle phenomenon
    and the detection of a CO2 effect requires a large spatial covering.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: No relevant information
  4: Potential productivity loss in Canada's boreal forests.
  5: The paper examines forest growth responses (BAI) to climate change in Canada's
    boreal forests, which has implications for carbon sequestration and potentially
    economic value of forests.
Quantitative material:
  2: "Declines in forest growth from 1982 to 2002 occurred in northwestern forests\
    \ east of the Rocky Mountains (up to -0.8%\xB7y\u22121) and also in the Atlantic\
    \ Maritime area (up to -0.6%\xB7y\u22121); Increases in aboveground forest growth\
    \ from 1982 to 2002 were apparent in the southeastern forests of the Boreal Shield\
    \ (up to +1.0%\xB7y\u22121); Accelerated growth rates from 1982 to 2002 were also\
    \ apparent in some of the westernmost forests of the Montane Cordillera and Pacific\
    \ Maritime regions (up to +0.98%\xB7y\u22121); Temperatures increased between\
    \ 0.5 and 3.0 \xB0C during the 20th century."

    1."
