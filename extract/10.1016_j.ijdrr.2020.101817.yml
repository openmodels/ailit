Drivers of Risk:
  6: Disasters, climate change impacts, vulnerabilities, disaster risks, hazards (exposure,
    vulnerability), human behavior, implementation gaps in DRR and CCA, lack of coordination,
    lack of integration between CCA and DRR fields
  7: Environmental and human-induced risks.
Highlights:
  5: The EEA study gives higher urgency to the dimension of financing, especially
    from private sources such as insurance, than the ESPREssO study.
  6: Need for comprehensive risk governance approach with more long-term resilience
    strategies, implementation gaps hinder DRR and CCA measures, risk and impact assessments
    are important, integrating DRR and CCA measures is important
  7: The establishment of an integrated methodological and operational approach for
    Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) in a risk-oriented
    modelling and design-oriented perspective is a central task for the future.
Methodology:
  5: The paper compares the ESPREssO project with the EEA (European Environment Agency)
    in terms of data, risk assessment, national programme partnerships, human behavior,
    finance, and monitoring. The analysis identifies convergences and divergences
    in these areas.
  6: Simulation-based risk and impact assessments to transfer risk knowledge from
    science into politic actions, assessments and all hazards approaches need to be
    strengthened; vulnerability assessment frameworks can support evidence-based and
    robust decision-making, analysis of human behaviour
  7: The TEM model is mentioned as a simulation-based approach to support detailed
    comparison via a scalable approach towards 'high performance computing' insights.
More Notes:
  5: The EEA process may have a bias towards national authorities and the insurance
    industry, while the ESPREssO project is more based on scientific analysis. The
    paper suggests that synthesis processes for coherence of CCA and DRR should be
    continued in different settings.
  6: Stresses the importance of data, collaboration, and integration of DRR and CCA
    efforts. Knowledge platforms provide opportunity for greater engagement and networking
  7: The paper emphasizes the importance of public-private partnerships and long-term
    planning initiatives, and the potential for external contributions by private
    stakeholders (including the insurance sector) in adaptation efforts. It also mentions
    comprehensive agricultural multi-risk management schemes.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  6: Mention of cascade and spill-over effects (physical and economic impacts of hazards),
    programmatic approaches deliver effective CCA and DRR integration; multipurpose
    nature of solutions leverages funding and facilitates connecting different communities
  7: The paper discusses the need for non-structural investments to achieve different
    outcomes, but doesn't specify macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
