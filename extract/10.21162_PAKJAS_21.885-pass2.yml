Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increasing temperature, heavy rainfall, droughts, floods, and CO2 levels impact
    cotton productivity.
  2: Climate change factors such as warm air, temperature, and extreme fluctuations
    in precipitation would increase the CO2 concentration.
  3: Climate change variables (average temperature, average rainfall, CO2), government
    subsidy, economic constraint, individual household social-economic status, education,
    infrastructure, fertilizer consumption, seed consumption, agriculture labor force,
    electricity consumption, available tractors and agriculture machinery.
  5: Temperature, Rainfall, CO2 emission
  6: Impacts include changes in average temperature, CO2 levels, and average rainfall.
Highlights:
  1: Increases in temperature and rainfall positively affected cotton productivity,
    while CO2 harms cotton productivity. Infrastructural changes positively affect
    cotton productivity in both the long and short run, while labor is negatively
    related to productivity. Area, fertilizer, and seed consumption showed a significant
    positive effect on cotton productivity.
  2: This study fills the literature gap by comprehensively considering all the influential
    primary factors (cotton productivity), climate factors (temperature, CO2, and
    rainfall), and non-climate factors (labor, infrastructure, seed, and fertilizer
    consumption).
  3: Study comprehensively analyzes maximum variables affecting cotton productivity
    in Pakistan using time series data from 1971 to 2018; Examines the long-run co-integration
    relationship between cotton TFP and various input variables.
  5: Rainfall has a significant and positive impact on cotton productivity, while
    CO2 emission has a negative relation with cotton productivity.
  6: Average temperature and rainfall positively impact productivity, while CO2 negatively
    impacts it.
Methodology:
  1: An autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) is employed.
  2: Analyzes nature and relationship of cotton productivity, climate factors (temperature,
    CO2, and rainfall), and non-climate factors (labor, infrastructure, seed, and
    fertilizer consumption) in the long and short run by employing the latest econometric
    models and statistical tools such as unit root test, autoregressive distributed
    lag (ARDL), and Johansen co-integration, on the latest available time-series data
    from 1971 to 2018 of Pakistan.
  3: Stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) approach adopted to decompose total factor
    productivity, measure technical efficiency, and distinguish between allocative
    and economic efficiencies; ARDL bounds testing model approach to examine the long-run
    co-integration relationship.
  5: ARDL bound cointegration test
  6: The study uses an ARDL error correction model to assess the stability of long-run
    and short-run coefficients.
More Notes:
  1: The model can be generalized to all developing countries.
  2: Pakistan's cotton industry is losing around 10-15% because of reasons like insufficient
    irrigation water, poor traditional practices for pest infestation, low high-density
    planting, and old and conventional ways of resource management.
  3: The study acknowledges data limitations which restricted the inclusion of some
    control variables like government subsidy, economic constraint, and socio-economic
    status.
  5: The study focuses on cotton productivity in Pakistan.
  6: Reduction in CO2 is suggested to reduce maximum temperature effects and enhance
    productivity.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Cotton productivity is affected by climate change and other factors.
  2: Cotton-related products contribute 10% to the national GDP.
  3: Cotton production (thousand tons), cultivated area under cotton (million hectares),
    Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of cotton crop
  5: Cotton productivity
  6: The study investigates the impact of climate and non-climate variables on cotton
    productivity.
Quantitative material:
  1: The study uses time series data from 1970 to 2018.
  2: In 2016-17 it was estimated that cotton production would increase 7.6% (14.1
    million bales) but did not achieve the target; output was -29% less (10.671 million
    bales).
  3: Time-series data from 1971 to 2018 used to estimate total factor productivity
    of cotton; graphical representation of cotton total factor productivity from 1971
    to 2017 (fluctuating between below 60% to 100%).
  5: 1% increase in rainfall could increase cotton productivity by 0.29% in the long
    run and 0.33% in the short run; 1% increase in CO2 emission would decrease cotton
    productivity -0.59% in the long run and -0.25% in the short run; 1% increase in
    seed consumption can enhance cotton productivity by 0.11% in the long run and
    0.008% in the short run; 1% increase in temperature would change cotton productivity
    in the long run and short run 0.037% and 0.08%, respectively; 1% increase in the
    area would increase cotton productivity by 0.39% in the long run and 0.003% in
    the short run; 1% increase in labor would decrease .065% agriculture productivity
    in the long run, and 0.0067% in the short run; 1% increase in fertilizer and infrastructure
    can enhance cotton productivity by 0.45% in the long run and 0.27% in the short
    run.
  6: The long- and short-run coefficients detail the effects of various variables
    like area, labor, temperature, infrastructure, fertilizer, rainfall, CO2, and
    seed on productivity.
