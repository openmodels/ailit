    including temperature-related mortality, air quality, labor, wildfire, coastal
    properties, high tide flooding and traffic, southwest dust, valley fever, rail,
    wind damage, electricity demand and supply, roads, electricity distribution and
    transmission, agriculture, urban drainage, water quality, winter recreation, crime,
    inland flooding, and marine fisheries.
  21: The paper estimates the net present value of future damages from one tonne of
    CO2 emitted, focusing on damages occurring within the CONUS (Continental United
    States).
Highlights:
  1: The majority of annual long-term (e.g., 2090) damages are associated with climate
    change impacts to human health, including mortality attributable to climate-driven
    changes in temperature and air pollution (O3 and PM2.5) exposure.
  2: FrEDI can trace economic damages in the US from marginal changes in greenhouse
    gas emissions.
  3: A unique feature of this approach is the rich range of uncertainty parameters
    that can be assessed, though separately considering climate parameter and socioeconomic
    uncertainty ignores potential feedbacks.
  4: FrEDI can quickly monetize a broad range of climate-driven impacts, accounting
    for socio-economic and climate scenarios.
  5: Damages from climate change are sensitive to adaptation assumptions, with adaptation
    having the capacity to exacerbate or ameliorate future damages, although amelioration
    is more common.
  6: Climate-driven damages are largest for the health category, primarily from premature
    mortality. Labor is the third-largest damage category in 2090, representing damages
    from lost labor productivity.
  7: Climate-driven premature mortality due to temperature changes is a major impact,
    with an estimated USD 2.3 trillion per year in damages by 2090.
  8: "The Southeast will experience the largest annual damages per capita (mean: USD9300\
    \ per person annually; 95% CI: USD1800\u2013USD37000 per person annually), whereas\
    \ the smallest damages per capita are expected in the Southwest region (mean:\
    \ USD6300 per person annually; 95% CI: USD840\u2013USD27000 per person annually)."
  9: The largest monetary damages in 2090 are expected from premature mortality associated
    with changes in temperature. Negative impacts of climate change outweigh the positives
    such that net losses are projected in each region.
  10: The study estimates regional economic damages from climate change in the US,
    identifying key sectors contributing to these damages. Damages per tonne of CO2
    are estimated to be almost 20% of a recent global value.
  11: Important outcomes include disparities in vulnerability to climate-driven changes,
    illustrated by increased mortality rates and labor hours lost among racial and
    ethnic groups by 2090.
  12: The analysis underscores that premature mortality due to temperature changes
    is a significant contributor to quantified damages; potential adaptation options
    are discussed but not explicitly modeled for all sectors.
  13: FrEDI analysis includes scenarios for adaptation in sectors like coastal infrastructure,
    focusing on current practices and the potential for future technological advancements.
  14: Temperature-related mortality is projected to have the largest economic impact,
    with a mean damage of USD 2300 billion, followed by labor allocation and wildfire
    air quality.
  15: Significant increase in total climate-driven impacts by 2100, with specific
    increases projected for temperature-related mortality, air quality, high tide
    flooding, wildfire, coastal property damage, and others.
  16: Adaptation has the capacity to both exacerbate and ameliorate future climate-driven
    damages, and climate damages are sensitive to assumptions about adaptation scenarios.
    Damages vary considerably by region and sector.
  18: The paper compares temperature-related premature mortality damages across three
    studies (Cromar et al., Hsiang et al., and Mills et al.) for the year 2090, considering
    adaptation in one case.
  20: Several sectors show significant increases in climate-related impacts, including
    temperature-related mortality, air quality, labor, wildfire, coastal properties,
    high tide flooding, inland flooding, and marine fisheries. Winter recreation shows
    a decreasing impact. The lower-right panel sums the total damages across all sectors.
  21: The net present value of future damages from one tonne of CO2 is highly sensitive
    to the discount rate used.
Methodology:
  1: Utilizes the reduced-complexity model, the Framework for Evaluating Damages and
    Impacts (FrEDI), to rapidly project economic and physical impacts of climate change
    across 10000 future scenarios.
  2: FrEDI uses paired probabilistic emissions and socioeconomic projections with
    a climate model to quantify impacts in the US.
  3: "The analysis uses 10000 randomly sampled scenarios of global greenhouse gas\
    \ emissions, US population, and US GDP from the Resources for the Future\u2013\
    Socioeconomic Projections (RFF-SPs). These are input to the Finite Amplitude Impulse\
    \ Response (FaIR) model to generate global mean surface temperature projections.\
    \ The Framework for Evaluating Damages and Impacts (FrEDI) model then uses these\
    \ temperature projections, along with population and GDP projections, to calculate\
    \ climate-driven damages across 20 sectors in seven US regions from 2020 to 2300."
  4: The analysis involves calculating global mean surface temperature using the FaIR
    model based on RFF-SPs trajectories, then using this temperature in the FrEDI
    model to assess sectoral damages.
  5: FrEDI accounts for adaptation by grouping sectors into categories based on adaptation
    assumptions such as 'reactive,' 'reasonably anticipated adaptation,' or 'no additional
    adaptation.'
  6: Uses FrEDI model with 10,000 baseline RFF-SP scenarios (emission, population,
    and GDP trajectories). Calculates net present value (NPV) using both constant
    and Ramsey discounting approaches. Applies correction to account for the relationship
    between sectoral damages and GDP per capita.
  7: The analysis is based on scenarios (RFF-SPs) projecting emissions, GDP, and population,
    and evaluates climate impacts up to 2100.
  8: The FrEDI framework is used to assess climate-driven damages across various sectors,
    projecting impacts for the year 2090. The analysis uses 10000 RFF-SP projections.
    Sectors are independent and additive.
  9: Analysis uses 10000 RFF-SP scenarios, incorporates climate parameter uncertainty
    with a Monte Carlo approach using FaIR, and accounts for parametric uncertainty
    in damage functions.
  10: The analysis uses the FrEDI model to project climate damages through 2300, considering
    different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and discounting assumptions. It
    quantifies net present damages from emissions pulses.
  11: The methodology involves the use of socioeconomic input scenarios (SSP) and
    considers methane and nitrous oxide emissions valuations with Ramsey discounting.
  12: The study uses the FrEDI framework, which involves a decade of research exploring
    individual sectoral impacts in the contiguous US, accounting for factors like
    global mean surface temperature, US GDP, and US population.
  13: FrEDI can update its framework with new or updated impact studies and incorporates
    adaptation assumptions from underlying studies, providing scenarios with and without
    adaptation.
  14: The analysis estimates damages for the year 2090 using different adaptation
    scenarios (No additional, Reactive, Reasonably anticipated, Proactive, With CO2
    fertilization, 2011 precursor emissions) for various sectors across the US.
  15: Temporal trends are modeled as a function of temperature/sea level rise, binned
    damage functions, and sector-specific scalars (e.g., per capita income-dependent
    VSL). Discontinuities can arise from bin boundaries or thresholds in underlying
    studies (e.g., sharp coastal property damage increases after sea levels breach
    100cm).
  16: The analysis considers reactive and proactive adaptation scenarios, and the
    sensitivity of future climate damages to changes in sectors is assessed. Results
    are applicable to the year 2090.
  18: "FrEDI is used to estimate damage, with socioeconomic drivers considered beyond\
    \ 2090 through 2300 on a sector-specific basis, scaling with population and/or\
    \ GDP per capita. Year-specific adjustment factors are also applied. For damages\
    \ above the calibration regime, FrEDI assumes a linear rate of change in damages\
    \ equal to the change in damages from 5 to 6\u25E6."
  20: The analysis projects sectoral damages from 2015 to 2090 across 10000 projections.
    It shows mean and median damages, as well as 95% confidence intervals (CI).
  21: The Framework for Evaluating Damages and Impacts (FrEDI) model is used to calculate
    the net present damages associated with a pulse of 1 tonne of CO2 emitted in 2020,
    run through 2300. Damages post-2100 are based on sea-level-rise-based damages
    from 2100 adjusted for real property price appreciation. A comparison is made
    between a Ramsey discounting approach and a constant discount rate of 3%.
More Notes:
  1: "Southeast is projected to experience the largest annual damages per capita (mean:\
    \ USD9300 per person annually; 95%CI: USD1800\u2013USD37000 per person annually),\
    \ whereas the smallest damages per capita are expected in the Southwest (mean:\
    \ USD6300 per person annually; 95% CI: USD840\u2013USD27000 per person annually)."
  2: FrEDI provides flexible impact estimation by using customizable warming scenarios
    and socioeconomic projections.
  3: Emissions of gases and aerosols not included in the RFF-SP projections were set
    to the associated emissions in the SSP2-4.5 scenario.
  6: "Damages are shown in 2020 US dollars. Con\uFB01dence intervals include uncertainty\
    \ in GDP, population, and climate parameters but do not account for additional\
    \ sectoral parametric or structural uncertainty."
  8: Adaptation options are considered in some sectors (e.g., coastal property) but
    not in others (e.g., temperature-related mortality). The study acknowledges potential
    double counting between temperature-related mortality and air quality and the
    possibility of compounding effects not fully captured.
  9: Climate change may broaden existing societal inequalities. Black or African Americans
    are more likely to be affected by additional premature mortality from climate-driven
    changes in air quality, while Hispanic or Latino Americans are more likely to
    experience lost labor hours.
  10: The study emphasizes the sensitivity of damage estimates to discounting assumptions
    and the inclusion of structural uncertainty.
  14: The table differentiates between various adaptation strategies and their effect
    on damage estimates. It also considers both economic damages and mortality impacts
    across different sectors.
  15: The uncertainty ranges of the projections widen over time, indicating increasing
    uncertainty in long-term climate impacts.
  18: The study uses the Cromar et al. (2022) results for temperature-related mortality
    throughout the main text.
  20: The time series in Figure A4 extends to 2300, though the primary figure descriptions
    focus on the 2015-2090 period.
