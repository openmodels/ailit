Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate-driven changes in temperature, air pollution (O3 and PM2.5) exposure,
    and other climate change impacts
  2: Climate-driven changes across the country, uncertainty in climate model parameters,
    a wide range of future emissions and socioeconomic conditions, and structural
    uncertainty in select damage functions.
  3: Global greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, and N2O), US population, and US GDP.
  4: Changes in CONUS temperature and sea level rise, driven by global mean temperature
    change and emissions scenarios. US GDP and regional population also drive sectoral
    damages.
  5: Sea level rise, temperature scenarios, socioeconomic scenarios, and additional
    tonne of CO2, CH4, or N2O emissions.
  6: Climate-driven changes in temperature and air quality (O3 and PM2.5); Valley
    fever; Southwest dust; wildfire smoke exposure and suppression costs; crime incidents.
  7: "Changes in temperature, air quality, high-tide flooding, wild\uFB01res, tropical\
    \ storm frequency and wind strength, southwestern dust exposure, Valley fever\
    \ incidence."
  8: Climate change impacts, including increased temperatures, sea level rise, and
    related events (e.g., wildfires).
  9: Climate-driven changes in temperature, high-tide flooding, climate-driven change
    in air quality, wildfires.
  10: Climate change impacts across different sectors, GHG emissions.
  11: Climate-driven changes in air quality; Temperature change relative to FrEDI
    baseline; Greenhouse gas emissions (CH4, N2O).
  12: Change in global mean surface temperature, US GDP, US population, and assumptions
    about adaptation.
  14: Various environmental and climate-related changes such as temperature changes,
    high-tide flooding, riverine flooding, and hurricane wind damage are driving risks
    across sectors.
  15: The temporal trends in sectoral damages are driven by underlying temperature
    (or sea level rise), binned damage functions, and sector-specific scalars (e.g.,
    per capita income-dependent VSL).
  17: Climate change impacts, specifically those affecting electricity transmission
    and distribution, rail, roads, coastal properties, and transportation impacts
    from high-tide flooding.
  18: Temperature changes; population and GDP trajectories; socioeconomic drivers.
  20: Climate change impacting temperature-related mortality, air quality, labor productivity,
    wildfire risk, coastal properties, high tide flooding, dust storms, disease (Valley
    Fever), rail systems, wind damage, electricity demand and supply, road infrastructure,
    electricity distribution and transmission, agriculture, urban drainage, water
    quality, winter recreation, crime, inland flooding, and marine fisheries.
  21: Emission of one tonne of CO2 in the year 2020.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change impacts may also broaden existing societal inequalities, with
    Black or African Americans being disproportionately affected by additional premature
    mortality from changes in air quality
  2: The framework allows us to investigate the potential range of projected long-term
    annual climate change impacts that are associated with uncertainty in climate
    model parameters, a wide range of future emissions and socioeconomic conditions,
    and structural uncertainty in select damage functions.
  4: FrEDI monetizes a broad range of climate-driven impacts in the US under various
    warming, emission, and socioeconomic trajectories in a short computational time
    frame. The analysis presents national and regional damages calculated from the
    average across the GCM ensemble.
  5: Adaptation has the capacity to both exacerbate and ameliorate future climate-driven
    damages, with the latter being more common; differential climate-driven damages
    across impact sectors, geographic regions, and adaptation options, and across
    different populations within the US.
  6: Net national damages increase over time, reaching USD 2.9 trillion annually by
    2090, equivalent to approximately 3% of US GDP; climate-driven damages are largest
    for the health category, primarily due to premature mortality.
  7: National total damages in 2090 are primarily driven by the valuation of premature
    mortality attributable to climate-driven changes in temperature. Climate-driven
    damages to infrastructure (transportation) and health are expected to increase
    significantly. Total damages as a share of US GDP is expected to increase over
    the century.
  8: "The Southeast region is projected to experience the largest annual damages per\
    \ capita (mean: USD9300 per person annually; 95% CI: USD1800\u2013USD37000 per\
    \ person annually), while the Southwest region is expected to have the smallest\
    \ damages per capita (mean: USD6300 per person annually; 95% CI: USD840\u2013\
    USD27000 per person)."
  9: The largest monetary damages in 2090 are expected from premature mortality associated
    with changes in temperature. Negative impacts of climate change outweigh the positives,
    resulting in net losses in each region. Climate change may broaden existing societal
    inequalities, with disproportionate exposure risks for different populations.
  10: There are significant varying climate change impacts across different U.S. regions
    and sectors, with temperature-related mortality being a key driver.
  11: Annual US damages in 2090 range from 700 billion USD (SSP1-1.9) to 7000 billion
    USD (SSP5-8.5). Air quality risks and mortality/labor losses disproportionately
    affect vulnerable populations and racial/ethnic groups. Higher temperature scenarios
    are associated with substantially higher damages.
  12: The FrEDI framework provides a useful understanding of the channels through
    which climate change can affect US citizens and residents. There can be significant
    benefits to the US from greenhouse gas mitigation, and significant benefits to
    the people of the US
  14: Temperature-related mortality and electricity demand/supply impacts indicate
    high predicted costs, highlighting significant areas of concern for climate impact.
  15: Climate-driven impacts are expected to increase across various sectors from
    2010 to 2090, with total damages showing a significant upward trend and increasing
    uncertainty over time. Coastal property damage experiences a sharp increase after
    2080 when sea levels breach 100cm.
  17: Proactive adaptation consistently leads to lower damage estimates compared to
    reactive adaptation or no adaptation across all sectors examined.
  18: Temperature-related premature mortality damages vary widely across studies,
    ranging from negative values (benefits) to several trillion USD. Socioeconomic
    drivers significantly influence damage estimates.
  20: The analysis projects sectoral damages and total damages from climate change,
    with quantification in billions/trillions of 2020 USD. The projections cover a
    long time horizon (up to 2300) and incorporate uncertainty with confidence intervals.
    Various specific impact areas are also projected from 2010 to 2090.
  21: The estimated net present value of damages from emitting one ton of CO2 varies
    significantly depending on the discount rate applied, with lower discount rates
    resulting in higher damage estimates.
Methodology:
  1: FrEDI projections are extended through 2300 to estimate the net present climate-driven
    damages within US borders from marginal changes in greenhouse gas emissions
  2: Uses the Framework for Evaluating Damages and Impacts (FrEDI) to assess US economic
    and physical impacts of climate change. FrEDI draws upon over 30 climate change
    impact models to develop relationships between mean surface temperature change
    and climate-driven impacts across 20 sectors within US borders through the end
    of the 21st century. Uses 10000 probabilistic emissions and socioeconomic projections
    with temperature projections from a simple climate model as inputs. Extends methodology
    out to the year 2300 to assess the net present damage in the US resulting from
    an additional tonne of CO2, CH4, or N2O emissions.
  3: "The paper uses 10,000 randomly sampled scenarios of global greenhouse gas emissions\
    \ (CO2, CH4, and N2O), US population, and US GDP from the Resources for the Future\u2013\
    Socioeconomic Projections (RFF-SPs). Emission trajectories are input to the Finite\
    \ Amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model (v1.6.2), a simple emissions-based climate\
    \ model. The resulting temperature projections are then passed to FrEDI (v3.0)\
    \ to calculate the physical and economic climate-driven damages."
  4: Uses the FrEDI model to estimate sectoral climate impacts in the US, driven by
    US emission trajectories passed through the FaIR climate model to calculate global
    mean surface temperature. CONUS temperature is estimated as 1.42 times global
    temperature. A semi-empirical approach from existing literature (Kopp et al.,
    2016) is used within FrEDI to calculate the impacts of sea level rise. Regional
    population is disaggregated from national projections.
  5: Extrapolates sector-specific, temperature-binned damage functions to account
    for the full range of temperature scenarios derived from RFF-SP emission scenarios;
    calculates annual marginal climate-driven damages as the difference between the
    damages in the baseline and perturbed cases; discounts these marginal annual damages
    to the year of emissions and then aggregates across the time series into a single
    net present-damage estimate.
  6: "Uses FrEDI model with 10,000 baseline RFF-SP scenarios; Ramsey discounting approach\
    \ calibrated to a near-term target discount rate of 2% (\u03C1=0.2% and \u03B7\
    =1.24); net present value calculated using both constant and time-varying discount\
    \ rates."
  7: Uses 10000 RFF-SP emission, GDP, and population scenarios to project climate
    damages.
  8: Uses the FrEDI (Framework for Risk and Economic Assessment of Damages due to
    climate change) analytical approach to estimate climate-driven damages across
    sectors, looking at impacts in the year 2090. The sectors are treated as independent
    and additive. Considers different adaptation options, especially in the coastal
    property sector.
  9: The analysis uses the FrEDI model with 10000 RFF-SP scenarios and a Monte Carlo
    approach to sample climate parameter uncertainty using FaIR.
  10: The FrEDI model is used to project climate damages through 2300. Net present
    value is calculated as the discounted sum of future damages produced by an emissions
    pulse in 2020 over the period 2020-2300, with Ramsey discounting applied.
  11: The study uses FrEDI (Framework for Risk and Economic Impact Assessment) to
    estimate damages. It utilizes SSP (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway) scenarios. The
    methodology can be extended to explore the net present value of future damages
    resulting from additional greenhouse gas emissions. The climate model FaIR is
    used, and only captures the effects of feedbacks apparent in GCMs and the historic
    record.
  12: An evolving framework (FrEDI) is used to quantify the damages of climate change
    to the US economy, relying on sectoral impact research. The FrEDI framework is
    dynamic, with new sectors being added continuously.
  14: Uses projections for 2090 to estimate sector-specific damages due to climate-related
    risks with assumed adaptation scenarios.
  15: The analysis uses binned damage functions and sector-specific scalars to project
    damages based on temperature and sea level rise scenarios. Results applicable
    through 2090.
  17: The analysis uses the FrEDI (Framework for Risk and Economic Damage from Inundation)
    model, calibrated to estimate impacts for detailed 21st-century scenarios and
    trajectories. The model extrapolates damages for temperatures and sea-level rise
    beyond its original bounds by using the change in damages between 5 and 6 degrees
    and damages per centimeter of sea-level rise modeled by the two highest sea level
    scenarios in 2090.
  18: FrEDI (Framework for Risk and Economic Assessment of Climate Extremes) is used
    to estimate damages. It incorporates year-specific socioeconomic conditions, scaling
    impacts with population and/or GDP per capita or using year-specific adjustment
    factors derived from underlying studies. For years beyond 2090, adjustments are
    either linearly extrapolated or held constant at 2090 levels.
  20: The analysis involves 10,000 projections of sectoral damages from 2100 to 2300.
    Mean and median damages are calculated, and 95% confidence intervals are provided.
    The analysis also presents projections of specific climate change impacts from
    2010-2090.
  21: The Framework for Evaluating Damages and Impacts (FrEDI) is used through 2300
    to calculate the net present damages. Damages post-2100 are based on sea-level-rise-based
    damages from 2100 adjusted for real property price appreciation using GDP per
    capita and an income elasticity of 0.45. A comparison is made between a Ramsey
    discounting approach and a constant discount rate of 3%.
More Notes:
  1: The analysis provides a detailed illustration of the distribution of climate
    change impacts within US borders.
  4: FrEDI currently includes 20 impact sectors. Population projections do not consider
    future climate changes such as climate-induced migration. Damage functions are
    developed for each sector, region and GCM.
  5: FrEDI uses reactive, reasonably anticipated adaptation, or no additional adaptation
    assumptions. Analysis considers differential vulnerability including low income,
    ethnicity, race, educational attainment, and age. Discount rate of 3% is considered
    to be the appropriate discount rate to use for impacts on private consumption.
  6: Damages are shown in 2020 US dollars; confidence intervals include uncertainty
    in GDP, population, and climate parameters but do not account for additional sectoral
    parametric or structural uncertainty.
  7: Sectoral damages are sensitive to assumptions in the adaptation scenarios.
  8: The study acknowledges potential double-counting issues between temperature-related
    mortality and air quality impacts and compounding effects not fully captured by
    the FrEDI approach, like power outages exacerbating temperature-related mortality.
    Damages are sensitive to adaptation options in each sector where they are considered.
  9: Damage estimates are sensitive to uncertainties in the underlying damage functions
    themselves. The analysis incorporates parametric uncertainty in each damage function.
    Results include distributional physical effects across four groups of potentially
    socially vulnerable populations for six sectors.
  10: The analysis focuses on direct CONUS (Continental US) impacts.
  11: Damages are constrained to the 48 contiguous United States, but the authors
    note that a global perspective is needed when evaluating policies related to global
    pollutants. Multi-century projections, particularly socioeconomic projections,
    are inherently challenging.
  12: The study focuses on damages within the US (CONUS), acknowledging that impacts
    are global. It mentions limitations, including the omission of several non-market
    sectors and tipping elements. The framework includes adaptation in some sectors,
    but not all. CO2 fertilization effects are included in the agriculture sector.
  15: Discontinuities can occur at the boundary between temperature bins or due to
    thresholds in the underlying studies. The ordering of sectors is based on decreasing
    mean damages in the year 2090.
  18: The analysis considers how the sensitivity to socioeconomic drivers continues
    beyond 2090 through 2300 on a sector-specific basis. Some sectors are not adjusted
    for socioeconomic projections but vary based only on sensitivity to projected
    temperature.
  21: The views presented in the paper do not necessarily represent the views or policies
    of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The paper acknowledges research assistance
    and analytic support from several individuals.
