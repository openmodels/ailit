Drivers of Risk:
  1: Decreasing trend in precipitation
  2: Changes in precipitation patterns in the Pampas, especially the increase in rainfall,
    have impacted agricultural systems, potentially affecting economic sustainability
    and land use.
  4: Decrease in annual precipitation, particularly in rain-fed agricultural regions
    like the Argentine Pampas.
  7: Decadal climate variability impacting crop yields.
  8: Decreasing precipitation trends, climate variability.
  9: Decreasing precipitation (inter-decadal climate variability).
  10: Decreasing precipitation trends leading to lower crop yields and increased economic
    losses in marginal agricultural regions.
Highlights:
  1: If precipitation decreases, Pergamino crop economic returns would not change
    noticeably, but Pilar would experience a marked decrease in profits and an increase
    in production risks; Potential negative impacts might be mitigated, in part, if
    farmers adapt their agronomic management.
  2: There has been a significant expansion of agriculture in the Pampas due to increased
    rainfall, with a notable increase in soybean production and changes in land use
    patterns, raising concerns about the sustainability of current systems if drier
    conditions return.
  7: The paper examines the impact of climate variability on economic returns and
    production risk for key crops in the Pampas region and models adaptive responses
    of farmers. The analysis considers different adaptive responses to changes in
    climate.
  8: Decreasing precipitation significantly impacts crop profitability in marginal
    production areas like Pilar, leading to reduced profits and increased risk of
    economic losses (PNER).
  9: Adaptation, even delayed adaptation, is better than no adaptation in stabilizing
    the probability of negative farm-wide economic returns in Pilar. Without adaptation,
    the probability of economic failure increases significantly with decreasing rainfall.
  10: Any type of farmer adaptation can help reduce negative impacts of unfavorable
    climate scenarios such as rainfall decreases.
Methodology:
  1: Assessment of potential impacts of decreasing precipitation on 2 agricultural
    systems using crop models and considering adaptation measures using current available
    technology or know-how; Analysis is applicable to the economic sustainability
    of the studied Argentinian Pampas agricultural systems under potential future
    climate scenarios.
  2: The study uses historical climate records to define future climate scenarios,
    applies a semi-parametric weather generator for daily weather simulations, and
    uses crop growth models and economic analyses to simulate outcomes.
  4: Averaged slopes for the 10 most recent 25-year windows to select plausible precipitation
    decrease. Used a semi-parametric method and biased resampling algorithm to downscale
    climate trajectories into daily synthetic weather series. Ensemble of simulations
    is consistent with decadal trends. Weather variables include max/min temperature,
    daily precipitation, and solar radiation.
  6: The page describes the use of prospect theory and cumulative prospect theory
    (CPT) to assess the decision-making process in the context of agricultural economics,
    suggesting a focus on deviations from reference points due to loss aversion and
    diminishing sensitivity.
  7: "Crop simulations are performed for 24 cropping cycles, with 100 realizations\
    \ for each cycle. Smoothing is applied to the simulated profits. Adaptive responses\
    \ are modeled using 'na\xEFve,' 'clairvoyant,' and 'intermediate' farmer scenarios.\
    \ Optimal land allocations are identified using a genetic algorithm (GA)."
  8: Uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize land allocation based on crop/management
    conditions and economic profit, incorporating risk preferences from Cumulative
    Prospect Theory (CPT). The model simulates the impact of decreasing precipitation
    trends on crop profits over a 24-year period.
  9: Simulation of farm economic returns under different climate scenarios and adaptation
    strategies (instant adaptation, 4-year adaptation, no adaptation) for Pilar over
    24 cropping cycles. The analysis considers changes in land allocation patterns.
  10: Simulation of different farmer adaptation strategies to changing precipitation
    conditions in agricultural scenarios.
More Notes:
  1: 'The study focuses on 2 specific agricultural regions within the Argentinian
    Pampas: Pergamino and Pilar.'
  9: The study focuses on two locations in the Argentine Pampas, Pilar and Pergamino.
    The results presented here are only for Pilar, where adaptation strategies had
    a noticeable impact on farm-wide economic returns. In Pergamino, there were no
    marked differences between adaptation and no adaptation.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Crop economic returns; Profits; Production risks
  7: Economic returns ($/ha) and the probability of negative economic returns (a metric
    of production risk) for different cropping systems.
  8: Crop economic profits (dollars per hectare), Probability of Negative Economic
    Returns (PNER).
  9: Farm-wide economic returns ($/ha) and probability of negative farm-wide economic
    returns.
Quantitative material:
  1: Crop economic returns would not change noticeably in Pergamino, while Pilar would
    experience a marked decrease in profits and an increase in production risks.
  4: 'Averaged precipitation decrease in Pilar: -6.3 mm/year. Assumed precipitation
    decrease in Pergamino: -5.5 mm/year. Starting point for projections: 980 mm (Pergamino)
    and 775 mm (Pilar). Generation of 100 equally likely 25-year sequences of simulated
    daily weather.'
  6: The page contains a detailed table of simulated crop management practices and
    corresponding yield trends under conditions of decreasing precipitation for various
    crops in Pergamino and Pilar.
  7: Figure 4 shows the temporal evolution of economic returns and probability of
    negative economic returns for soybean, maize, and wheat/soybean double crops under
    different management conditions.
  8: "Wheat/soybean double crop in Pilar started with $80/ha profit and reached close\
    \ to zero after 24 years; Maize in Pilar saw a 75% decrease in economic returns\
    \ after 24 years; Soybean in Pilar saw a 40% decrease in economic returns after\
    \ 24 years; Economic returns changed slightly in Pergamino; $170 ha\u20131 and\
    \ $230 ha\u20131 rent costs in Pilar and Pergamino respectively; In Pilar, PNER\
    \ for maize increased from 0.15 to 0.55 over 24 years; PNER for soybean increased\
    \ from 0.05 to 0.20; PNER for wheat/soybean increased from 0.35 to 0.65."
  9: Figure 5 shows the temporal evolution of farm-wide economic returns and the probability
    of negative farm-wide economic returns in Pilar under different adaptation scenarios.
    In the absence of adaptation, the probability of economic failure increases rapidly
    with decreasing precipitation, reaching about 0.35 towards the end of the sequence
    (initially around 0.20).
  10: Simulated yield decreases for maize and soybean under different management conditions,
    and a doubling of the probability of economic losses for certain crops in a drier
    climate.
