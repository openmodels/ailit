Drivers of Risk:
  1: Environmental variations including average temperature, minimum temperature,
    maximum temperature, evapotranspiration, precipitation, runoff, soil moisture,
    vapor pressure, radiation, and wind speed.
  2: Increase in temperatures upsetting environmental conditions and water supply;
    floods, droughts, and temperature increases. Weather changes might affect crops,
    generating losses for producers.
  3: Environmental variations, including average temperature, maximum and minimum
    temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, soil moisture, wind speed,
    vapor pressure, and radiation.
  4: Increase in average temperatures and variability in annual precipitation in Colombia.
  5: Environmental variations such as vapor pressure and minimum temperature changes
    impact crop production.
  10: Increase in minimum temperatures and vapor pressure negatively affect coffee
    production. Temperature increase decreases rice production. Temperature increase
    has a negative effect on sugarcane production.
  11: Environmental variations, temperatures and vapor pressure increases, global
    warming, droughts, and critical rainy seasons.
Highlights:
  1: Increases in average temperatures negatively affect coffee, rice, and sugarcane
    production but positively affect palm oil and corn production in Colombia; vapor
    pressure increases negatively affect most crop production.
  2: The study aims to reveal the impact of climate change on the main agricultural
    products of Colombia.
  3: The study analyzes the relationship between environmental variables and the yearly
    production of key agricultural crops in Colombia between 2007 and 2020.
  4: The 21st century in Colombia has seen an increasing trend in average temperatures
    and higher variability in annual precipitation.
  5: Vapor pressure and minimum temperature were identified as the most impactful
    variables on crop production.
  10: Environmental variations negatively impact the production of coffee and rice
    in Colombia. Sugarcane is less affected.
  11: Environmental changes negatively impact traditional products like coffee and
    rice, necessitating adaptation towards products like corn and palm oil. Hydrological
    variables might balance the impact of climate change.
Methodology:
  1: Bayesian spatio-temporal model using production, climatic, and hydrological data
    from 1121 municipalities in Colombia from 2007 to 2020.
  2: Developed a statistical analysis for evaluating the impact of environmental changes
    on agricultural production in Colombia, adopting a Bayesian model that implements
    crop production and satellite data to estimate the perceptual variation in crop
    production due to temperature, water, and soil variations.
  3: A spatio-temporal Bayesian model is adopted to find the relationship between
    crop production and environmental variables. Descriptive analyses for temperature
    and precipitation were performed using maps and time series from 1960 to 2020.
  4: Implemented a Bayesian model to represent yearly crop production across 1121
    municipalities in Colombia from 2007 to 2020; used Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation
    (INLA) for model estimation.
  5: A Bayesian model was used to calculate growth rates in production due to environmental
    variables by evaluating the exponential of the logarithmic scale value.
  10: The study analyzes the effect of environmental variables on the production of
    principal agricultural products in Colombia. It also acknowledges the limited
    scope in estimating the impact of pests, plant diseases, and soil fertility.
  11: The paper uses models to analyze the effect of environmental variations on agricultural
    production in Colombia.
More Notes:
  1: The paper suggests the agricultural sector needs to substitute land use, promoting
    the production of palm oil and corn; logical variables do not have a significant
    effect on crops, suggesting that the abundance of water in Colombia might balance
    the impact of these variables.
  2: The paper focuses on the impact of environmental variables on the production
    of principal agricultural products in Colombia (coffee, corn, palm oil, rice,
    and sugarcane).
  3: The analysis uses data at the municipality level, providing a geographically
    granular understanding of climate impacts on agriculture. The study considers
    a wide range of environmental variables.
  4: Descriptive analyses indicate sugarcane production was highest from 2007 to 2020
    despite a drop in 2020; different crops such as rice, coffee, corn, and palm oil
    exhibited varying production trends during this period.
  10: The study suggests the substitution of coffee crops in low altitudes to higher
    altitudes and the need to develop agroindustrial strategies to avoid the impact
    of temperature increasement. Sugarcane production can be maintained in Colombia
    because the environmental variables obtained a lower impact on this crop.
  11: Colombia must manage the production location of traditional products and implement
    agro-industrial technologies to reduce the climatic change impact on crops.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic effects related to agricultural productivity of specific crops in Colombia.
  2: Climate change might impact agricultural production, inducing risk to food security
    and potentially leading to economic and social difficulties due to Colombia's
    dependence on the agricultural sector. The authors are evaluating the impact of
    environmental changes on agricultural production in Colombia.
  3: Impact on the production of principal agricultural products in Colombia, including
    coffee, corn, palm oil, rice, and sugarcane.
  10: Decreases in production of coffee and rice in Colombia due to environmental
    variations. Negative effect on sugarcane production, but at a lower level than
    rice and coffee.
  11: Impact on the production of principal agricultural products (coffee, rice, corn,
    palm oil) in Colombia.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Increases in average temperatures can affect coffee (-0.2% per \u02DAC), rice\
    \ (-3.76% per \u02DAC), and sugarcane (-0.19% per \u02DAC) production; palm oil\
    \ (+2.55% per \u02DAC) and corn (+1.28% per \u02DAC) production can increase with\
    \ average temperature; vapor pressure negatively impacts most crops (between -11.2%\
    \ to -0.43% per kPa), except rice."
