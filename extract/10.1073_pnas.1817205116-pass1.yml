Drivers of Risk:
  2: "Temperature change scenarios (L scenario: stabilized at +2\xB0C above preindustrial;\
    \ H scenario: stabilized at +5\xB0C)"
  3: Sea-level rise (SLR) due to contributions from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS),
    West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), and East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) under different
    temperature scenarios (L and H).
  4: Melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), and
    East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) due to rising temperatures.
  5: The increase in ice sheet mass loss is predominantly due to external forcing
    rather than internal variability.
  6: The study focuses on sea-level rise (SLR) and uses expert elicitation to quantify
    uncertainties related to it.
Highlights:
  2: SEJ exercise quantified uncertainties in ice sheet contributions to SLR, including
    dependence between processes.
  3: The declining GrIS share and GrIS/AIS ratio statistically reflect a higher mean
    estimate but a slightly less skewed distribution for GrIS than for WAIS, and a
    long tail for EAIS. The paper notes potentially nonlinear dynamic processes, especially
    in marine sectors of the AIS, as important for achieving higher SLR values.
  4: The study finds a statistically significant larger median and upper value of
    the likely range (83rd percentile) of sea-level rise compared to the AR5 findings,
    driven by larger uncertainty in ice sheet melt.  The study highlights the positive
    skew of SLR distributions, resulting in long upper tails, meaning the high-end
    SLR scenarios are more probable than suggested by AR5 (which only considered the
    likely range).
  5: Experts' assessments suggest possible significant sea-level rise (SLR exceed
    2 meters by 2100 under high-temperature scenarios).
  6: The study uses a weighted combination of expert opinions to achieve optimal statistical
    accuracy with minimal credible bounds.
Methodology:
  3: The analysis uses probability density functions (PDFs) for SLR contributions
    from ice sheets under different temperature scenarios, considering dependencies
    between different terms. The L scenario is slightly warmer than RCP2.6, and cooler
    than RCP4.5. The H scenario is comparable to RCP8.5. The analysis considers time
    horizons of 2050, 2100, 2200, and 2300, cumulative from 2000, and including a
    baseline imbalance of 0.76 mm/year.
  4: The analysis uses expert elicitation (SEJ2018) to generate probability density
    functions (PDFs) for ice sheet contributions to SLR under different temperature
    scenarios.  Stochastic resampling is used with linear interpolation for intermediate
    temperature scenarios. Dependence between ice sheets is considered. The results
    are applicable to SLR projections for the year 2100.
  5: Utilizes expert judgment elicitation through workshops, Monte Carlo sampling,
    and probabilistic SLR projection framework.
  6: Expert elicitation was used to quantify uncertainties, with experts providing
    judgments on topics for which the goal was to quantify uncertainties; Preliminary
    probability distributions were developed and presented to experts for revision;
    The Classical Model Decision Maker approach was used to combine expert judgments.
More Notes:
  2: The paper uses temperature trajectories, rather than emissions scenarios, to
    isolate expert judgments about the relationship between global mean surface air
    temperature change and ice sheet changes from judgements about climate sensitivity.
  3: The direct comparison with AR5 is complicated by different external forcings.
    The fifth percentiles for both temperature scenarios and for all epochs are less
    than their current values.
  4: The paper emphasizes the importance of considering the full range of uncertainty
    in SLR projections, particularly the upper tail, due to potential nonlinear processes
    in ice sheet dynamics.
  5: The study indicates a shift in expert opinions toward a stronger ice-sheet response
    to climate change and elaborates on uncertainties growing due to improved process
    understanding and representation.
  6: The study involved six US and two European experts; The study uses two combinations
    of the expert's opinion, EW01 which is an equally weighted combination, and PW01
    which is a performance weighted combination; The anonymized responses are available
    at https://data.bris.ac.uk/data/dataset/23k1jbtan6sjv2huakf63cqgav.

Quantitative material:
  2: Median SLR contributions for 2050 under L and H scenarios are 10 cm (5-18 cm)
    and 12 cm (6-24 cm) respectively.  For 2100, the median SLR contributions are
    26 cm (12-53 cm) and 51 cm (22-113 cm).

    \ and 2300 under L and H temperature scenarios, including mean \xB1 SD, median,\
    \ 5-95% credible interval, and 17-83% likely range. For example, for the H scenario\
