Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate risks, extreme climate risks.
  3: Extreme weather risks; Climate risk; Economic recession; Falling oil prices
  4: Climate risk, measured by the Global Climate Risk Index (CRI) score. A higher
    CRI indicates higher climate risks.
  5: Climate risk (CRI), Economic growth (lnpgdp), Urbanization (urbanr), Industrial
    structure (indusr), Trade activity (trader), Quality of governance (GOV)
  8: Climate risk (CRI and CRI_long, short and long term climate risks)
  9: Short-term climate risk (CRI) and long-term climate risk (CRI_long).
  11: Climate risk is impacting energy consumption and policy formulation, exacerbated
    by poor governance.
  12: Climate risk (CRI and CRI_long), operationalized using losses caused by extreme
    weather events.
  13: Short-term and long-term Climate Risk (CRI and CRI_long)
  14: Climate risk (CRI), business cycle fluctuations, oil price fluctuations
  15: Extreme climate events (floods, heatwaves, long-term droughts), oil price fluctuations,
    economic booms and recessions.
Highlights:
  2: Cross-country evidence on the impact of extreme climate risks on energy consumption
    transition is presented.
  3: Higher country governance quality promotes renewable energy consumption and energy
    consumption transition.
  4: Climate risk has a negative impact on energy consumption transition. Governance
    quality moderates the relationship between climate risk and energy consumption
    transition.
  5: "The study investigates how governance quality affects the relationship between\
    \ climate risk and energy consumption transition. A positive coefficient (\xB5\
    ) on the interaction term between CRI and GOV indicates that high government management\
    \ strengthens the relationship between climate risk and energy consumption transition,\
    \ while a negative coefficient weakens it."
  8: Climate risk (both short-term and long-term) significantly promotes the transition
    of energy consumption towards renewable energy sources. Long-term climate risk
    has a higher promotional effect on energy transition than short-term climate risk.
  9: The impact of climate risk on energy consumption transition is long-term and
    dynamic. Both short-term and long-term climate risk have a negative impact on
    fossil energy consumption.
  11: Good governance quality moderates the negative effects of climate risk by enabling
    effective energy policy measures.
  12: Climate risk promotes the transition of energy consumption. This result remains
    robust after controlling for endogeneity.
  13: Short-term climate risk positively impacts energy consumption transition in
    resource-rich countries. Long-term climate risks have a positive impact on energy
    consumption transition in both resource-rich and resource-poor countries. Short-term
    and long-term climate risk positively impact energy consumption transition in
    countries with low levels of economic development.
  14: Climate risk significantly promotes energy consumption transition in low-income
    countries, but not in high-income countries. Climate risk is not significantly
    related to energy consumption transition in economic boom periods, but is during
    economic recessions. The positive correlation between climate risk and energy
    consumption transition is not affected by oil price rises, but is promoted by
    falling oil prices.
  15: Countries facing higher climate risks are more likely to develop renewable energy
    sources for energy consumption transition, especially those facing long-term extreme
    climate risks. The relationship between climate risks and energy consumption transition
    is more significant when affected by economic recession and falling oil price
    fluctuations. National governance quality can weaken the promotion effect of climate
    risks on the transition of energy consumption.
Methodology:
  2: Analysis of panel data from 101 countries or regions from 2006 to 2019 to analyze
    the heterogeneous impacts of extreme climate risks on global energy consumption
    transition.
  3: Empirical analysis; Modelspecification and data sources in Section 3; Results
    in Section 4
  4: 'Spatial panel model with fixed effects is used to estimate the relationship
    between climate risk and energy consumption transition. The model includes control
    variables: lnpgdp, urbanr, indusr, trader.'
  5: Panel data model is constructed using a regression equation (Equation 2) to analyze
    the moderating effects of governance quality on the relationship between climate
    risk and energy consumption transition. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression
    is implied.
  8: Panel data analysis with ADF-Fisher test for unit root, Pearson correlation analysis,
    and regression analysis (mentioned in text, details in Table 4 not provided in
    this page).
  9: Fixed-effects model is used. The Hausman test indicates that the fixed-effects
    model is better for the empirical research of this study.
  11: The analysis uses econometric models with country and year fixed effects to
    estimate the moderating effect of governance on the relationship between climate
    risk and energy consumption.
  12: The study uses an instrumental variable method to address potential endogeneity.
    Coastline length (lncoastline) is used as an instrument for climate risk. The
    analysis involves two-stage regressions with country and year fixed effects. The
    results are applicable to the sample countries and time period used in the study.
  13: Regression analysis with sub-samples based on median fossil energy production
    (resource-rich/poor) and economic development level (high/low), controlling for
    other variables and including country and year fixed effects.
  14: Regression analysis dividing samples into economic boom/recession periods and
    oil-price-rise/fall periods based on external data sources
  15: Panel data regression analysis using annual country-level data from 101 countries
    from 2006 to 2019. The instrumental variable method is used to address potential
    endogeneity. Country and year fixed effects are included.
More Notes:
  2: The paper focuses on the impact of climate risks on energy consumption transition.
  3: The paper analyzes international differences in the impact of climate risks on
    energy consumption transition and heterogeneous effects when affected by external
    shocks. Transition of energy consumption is more significantly affected by climate
    risks in countries with lower levels of economic development.
  4: The CRI score from Germanwatch is multiplied by -1 so that a higher value reflects
    higher climate risk. The study also considers the cumulative climate risk index
    for the previous 20 years to study the continuous impact of long-term climate
    change.
  5: The climate risk index (CRI) is from Germanwatch's Global Climate Risk Index
    Report. Energy consumption data comes from the BP Statistical Review of World
    Energy. Control variables data is from the World Bank WDI Database.
  8: The paper argues that multicollinearity is not a serious concern. The negative
    correlation between climate risk and energy consumption transition is consistent
    with the prediction that higher climate risk leads to a higher share of renewable
    energy consumption.
  9: Control variables such as GDP per capita (lnpgdp), urbanization rate (urbanr),
    industrialization rate (indusr), and trade (trader) are included in the model.
  12: Public governance can significantly increase the proportion of renewable energy
    in initial energy consumption. The central government should perform more environmental
    responsibilities. Other control variables include lnpgdp (log of per capita GDP),
    urbanr (urbanization rate), indusr (industrialization rate), and trader (trade
    openness).
  14: The paper uses the National Bureau of Economic Research's definition of business
    cycles. The paper uses Jaffe's division of oil price fluctuation cycles. The mechanism
    by which the risk drivers affect the outcome is discussed.
  15: The paper focuses on the impact of climate risks on the *transition* of energy
    consumption (towards renewables), rather than direct macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
    The regressions in Table 9 do not directly quantify GDP effects or fiscal impacts.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Economic losses caused by severe weather conditions.
  4: Transition of energy consumption, represented by the proportion of renewable
    energy consumption in the total initial energy consumption.
  5: Energy consumption transition (ECT)
  8: Energy Consumption Transition (ECT), measured as a shift towards a higher share
    of renewable energy consumption.
  9: Energy consumption transition (ECT) is impacted by climate risk. This is related
    to economic costs of climate risk management at a national level. Fossil energy
    consumption is also an outcome.
  12: The transition of energy consumption (ECT) is the dependent variable.
  13: Energy consumption transition
  14: Transition of energy consumption (implied impact on economic growth via energy
    consumption)
