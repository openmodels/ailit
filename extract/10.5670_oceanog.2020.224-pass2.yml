Drivers of Risk:
  3: Changes in ocean temperature, changes in land ice volume, and changes in the
    volumes of ocean basins are impacting sea level.
  5: "Sea level variations (order of 15\xB110 m) due to the growth and decay of significant\
    \ ice sheets."
  6: Atmospheric CO2 concentrations, orbital cycles (precession, tilt, eccentricity),
    volcanism (Columbia River basalts), weathering
  7: Sea level rise is a key driver of risk, with the plots showing trends and projections
    of global mean sea level (GMSL) over various time scales.
  8: Anthropogenic warming, ocean warming, melting of ice sheets and mountain glaciers,
    emissions pathways

  8: Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) rise
Highlights:
  3: Ancient climates ranged from cold, glacial periods to warm, ice-free states.
  5: Remarkable new data show marine-terminating glaciers existed at the Sabrina Coast,
    adjacent to the Aurora Basin, Antarctica, by the Early to Middle Eocene, and modeling
    studies show that significant ice sheets (15+ m equivalent) can exist in regions
    of high Antarctic topography even while subtropical conditions persist along the
    coast.
  6: "Dynamic growth and collapse of moderately large ice sheets (0%\u201375% of modern\
    \ EAIS) controlled by the 1,200 kyr tilt cycle during the Middle to Late Eocene.\
    \ A continental-scale EAIS developed in the Icehouse Early Oligocene associated\
    \ with million year sea level falls of 40\u201360 m. During the Pliocene, global\
    \ mean surface temperatures were 2\xB0\u20133\xB0C warmer than 1850 CE with CO2\
    \ similar to 2020 and sea levels ~22\xB110 m above present."
  7: Sea level has risen and is projected to continue rising, with significant acceleration.
    The paper provides GMSL estimates and projections from the Late Pleistocene to
    2200 CE.
  8: The modern rise is not a remnant of deglaciation but rather due to anthropogenic
    warming. The rate of sea level rise increased in the late twentieth and early
    twenty-first centuries.
Methodology:
  3: Sea level change is determined by measuring time (age) and height of water with
    respect to datum levels using tide gauges and satellites.
  5: "Sea level obtained using benthic (Cibicidoides) foraminiferal \u03B418Obenthic\
    \ splice and \u03B418Oseawater using temperatures from Mg/Ca records; smoothed\
    \ sea level estimates from \u03B418O and Mg/Ca (interpolating to 20 kyr intervals\
    \ and using a 49-point Gaussian convolution filter, removing periods shorter than\
    \ 490 kyr); backstripped (progressive accounting for the effects of compaction,\
    \ loading, and thermal subsidence) onshore New Jersey estimates."
  6: "Analysis of \u03B418O-Mg/Ca-based estimates, sediment tracer data, and climate\
    \ models to reconstruct past sea level changes, ice sheet dynamics, and climate\
    \ conditions. The results are applicable to understanding long-term climate variability\
    \ and the sensitivity of ice sheets and sea level to changes in CO2 and orbital\
    \ forcing."
  7: Statistical analyses of satellite and tide gauge records were used to estimate
    GMSL from 1800 to 2020. A quadratic regression model was fit to satellite data
    to project sea level rise.
  8: Statistical analysis of satellite and tide gauge records. Simple regression model
    captures the late twentieth to twenty-first century acceleration of sea level
    rise.
More Notes:
  3: 'The paper discusses pre-Anthropocene climate states: Hothouse, cool Greenhouse,
    and Icehouse.'
  5: The sea level record older than 48 million years is less certain due to uncertainties
    in the Mg/Ca record, particularly for Site 1209.
  6: The paper discusses the role of the 41 kyr tilt cycle and other orbital cycles
    in pacing ice growth and decay. Mentions a critical CO2 threshold of 300 ppm for
    the beginning of large Northern Hemisphere ice ages.
  7: Figure 3 presents data sets and statistical analyses of variations in sea level
    from 30,000 calendar years before 1950 to 2200 CE.
Quantitative material:
  3: "GMSL variations are caused primarily by changes in ocean temperature (tens of\
    \ centimeters on annual to centennial timescales, with up to 10 m over the past\
    \ 48 million years due to cooling), changes in land ice volume (meter scale operating\
    \ on decadal to centennial scales and up to 200 m on astronomical timescales of\
    \ ~20\_thousand years [kyr] to 2,400 kyr), and changes in the volumes of ocean\
    \ basins (100+ m scale primarily on >1 million year timescales)."
  5: "Sea level variations on the order of 15\xB110 m occurred as significant ice\
    \ sheets grew and decayed; Small (15\u201325 m sea level equivalent or 25%\u2013\
    40% of modern volume), ephemeral ice sheets during the Late Cretaceous to Eocene."
  6: "Sea level falls: ~15-30m at ca. 49, 47.8, 46.9, and 44.5 Ma; ~10-20m at 43.6,\
    \ 42.9, and 40.8 Ma; ~40 m fall in Late Eocene. Sea level rise of ~40m at Middle\
    \ Eocene Climatic Optimum (40.1 Ma) followed by a ~20m drop (39.5 Ma). Mi3a: ~30\
    \ m fall, ~0.7\xB0C cooling; Mi3: ~50 m fall, ~1.2\xB0C cooling; Mi4: 20\u2013\
    30 m sea level fall, ~1.0\xB0C cooling. Pliocene sea levels stood ~22\xB110 m\
    \ above present. CO2 during the Pliocene was similar to 2020."
  7: "Over 0.7 m of sea level rise by 2100 is indicated by extrapolation of the acceleration\
    \ in satellite data, with a ~12.5 mm yr\u20131 rate of rise in 2100."
  8: "Late Holocene GMSL shows hundred-year scale oscillations of \xB1 0.1 m. Rate\
    \ of sea level rise between 1900 and 2015: 1.6 \xB1 0.4 mm yr\u20131. Rate of\
    \ sea level rise from 1993 to 2015: 3.4 \xB1 0.3 mm yr\u20131. Extrapolation predicts\
    \ over 0.7 m of GMSL rise by 2100 and a ~12.5 mm yr\u20131 rate of rise in 2100.\
    \ In a world that eliminates net carbon dioxide emissions, GMSL is likely to be\
    \ between 0.4 m and 1.0 m by the end of the century."
