Drivers of Risk:
  7: "Warming scenarios (2\xB0C, 5\xB0C, RCP 8.5)."
Highlights:
  7: Sea levels may rise over 0.7 m by 2100, with acceleration observed in satellite
    data.
Methodology:
  7: Process-model sea level projections, statistical analysis of satellite and tide
    gauge records, quadratic regression model fit to satellite data.
More Notes:
  7: "Figure 3 shows data sets and statistical analysis of variations in sea level\
    \ from 30,000 calendar years before 1950 (ka), including the Last Glacial Maximum,\
    \ 27\u201320 ka to 2200 CE."
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  7: Sea level rise projections under different warming scenarios.
Quantitative material:
  7: Sea level rise of over 0.7 m by 2100 and a ~12.5 mm yr-1 rate of rise in 2100
    (based on extrapolation of Beckley et al. (2016) satellite data).
