Drivers of Risk:
  15: Regulatory issues such as low water prices and inadequate abstraction rules.
  17: Climate change, climate variability, extreme weather events
  19: Climate hazards, vulnerability, and exposure of an economy.
  24: Climate change is unavoidable and perhaps already observable.
  27: No relevant information

    (Hsiang and Narita, 2012), drought (Kazianga and Udry, 2006), Katrina (Hallegatte,
    2008).
Highlights:
  7: Cross-sectional studies provide evidence of adaptation behavior but may not accurately
    reflect adaptation costs and benefits due to the assumption of instantaneous adaptation.
    Time series analysis is good for identifying short-term responses to weather variations
    but less suitable for long-term climatic factors and adaptation. Panel data can
    help isolate the effect of long-term adaptation on short-term shocks. Economy-wide
    simulation models are useful for understanding the economy-wide aspects of climate
    change and adaptation, including adjustments through relative prices.
  15: Public policy has roles in incentivizing private adaptation and providing climate-resilient
    public goods.
  16: Bringing an adaptation investment forward makes sense if the NPV of acting early
    is greater than the NPV of acting later.
  17: Attractive benefit-cost ratios for measures as diverse as enhanced meteorological
    services, better maintenance of drainage systems, integrated water resource management,
    and sustainable agricultural land management
  19: Economic development increases the supply and demand for adaptation; however,
    vulnerability and exposure may increase or decrease depending on development choices.
  24: Adaptation by private agents is widespread; adaptation is often hampered by
    behavioral barriers, market failures and policy distortions; there are adaptation
    gaps particularly in developing countries; adaptation thinking needs to be embedded
    into economic development plans.

Methodology:
  5: "Later attempts were made to separate out adaptation and create \u201Cadaptation\
    \ integrated assessment models\u201D, which jointly optimise adaptation and mitigation\
    \ action across mitigation costs, adaptation costs and residual damages"
  7: 'The paper discusses three main empirical methodologies: cross-sectional studies
    (Ricardian approach), time series analysis, and panel data analysis. It also mentions
    economy-wide simulation models.'
  16: Compares the NPV of adaptation investment at different times. Formula provided
    to calculate the difference in NPV between early and late adaptation, considering
    costs and benefits in both periods, as well as a discount factor.
  17: Survey of current experience, particularly with adaptation in developing countries
  19: Conceptual model of supply and demand for adaptation as a function of income
    and efficiency.
  24: Analysis includes a positive, empirical strand focusing on current adaptation
    behaviour of economic agents and a normative strand focused on public policy and
    the role of government in ensuring good adaptation outcomes; also includes a macroeconomic
    perspective.

More Notes:
  4: This page primarily introduces the topic of adaptation economics and outlines
    the structure of the paper. It doesn't provide specific quantitative results or
    findings related to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes of climate change or adaptation
    at a national level. It mainly sets the stage for a discussion of analytical tools
    and perspectives to be used in the subsequent sections.
  5: The damage function D(T) is defined as argminA (AC(A, T) + RD(A, T)), where A
    is adaptation effort and T is global mean temperature.
  15: There is emphasis on sector-specific adaptation rather than a universal toolkit.
  19: The paper posits that economic development generally leads to higher levels
    of adaptation.
  24: We know a fair amount about the adaptation response of farmers, but much less
    about other sectors, such as the adaptation behavior of firms. We do not know
    enough about measuring and assessing adaptive capacity and about practical barriers
    to adaptation.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  16: Net Present Value (NPV) of adaptation investments at different times.
  17: Benefit-cost ratios of adaptation measures
  24: Adaptation relates to other economic decisions, such as development planning
    and greenhouse gas mitigation, and how it affects financial flows.
