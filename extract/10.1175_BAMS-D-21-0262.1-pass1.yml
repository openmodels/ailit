Drivers of Risk:
  3: Extreme weather and climate events, exponential population growth and demographic
    shifts (e.g., urbanization, increase in coastal populations), changing global
    economy.
  4: Warming climate (increasing extremes in heat, drought, rainfall, wildfire, tropical
    cyclone intensity, and flooding), biodiversity loss, unsustainable consumption
    of natural resources, degradation of ecosystems, human demographic shifts including
    rapid urbanization, social and economic inequalities, and a pandemic, loss of
    Arctic sea ice.
  5: Meteorological events (tropical storms, local windstorms including tornadoes),
    Hydrological events (flood and mass movement), Climatological events (extreme
    temperatures, droughts, and forest fires).
  7: Increasing stakeholder and customer demand and need for tailored and seamless
    weather and climate forecasting are key drivers.
  10: Improvement in horizontal and vertical resolution of operational models, horizontal
    resolution of global numerical weather prediction (NWP) models increased from
    about 400 km in the early 1960s to less than 10 km in 2020, regional fine-mesh
    models have reached 1 km in resolution, model vertical levels increased from one-
    and three-layered quasigeostrophic models to more than 130 levels.

    and midlatitude circulation changes in climate change projections, deep-ocean
    circulation and ice sheet sensitivity to change in climate models, convective
    precipitation, closure of the water and energy cycle
  14: Inaccurate or incomplete weather and climate forecasts.
