Drivers of Risk:
  3: Near-term transition and longer-term physical climate risks of greenhouse gas
    emissions pathways
  4: Increasing temperatures, shift to a low-carbon economy, temperature pathways
    (spanning 1.5-4oC levels of long-term warming), technological, policy and socio-economic
    factors.
  6: physical and transition risks stemming from scenarios spanning 1.5-4oC temperatures
    and encompassing a broad range of transition dynamics
  8: Emissions from coal, oil, and gas; lack of land use policy; carbon and energy
    intensity improvements; behavior changes; technology improvements.
  9: Physical risks are driven by heatwaves, hydrological and agricultural drought,
    river flooding, and changes in maize crop duration. Transition risks are driven
    by low-carbon transition variables and feasibility of the transition.
  12: Stringency of emissions reduction pathways, particularly differences between
    1.5C, 2C, and NDC pledge scenarios; Fossil fuel demand reductions; Coal plant
    reductions.
  15: Carbon prices; Potential stranding of carbon-intensive assets (e.g., coal-fired
    power stations); Demand reductions for fossil fuels and related technologies;
    Changes to electricity and food prices resulting from transitions; Physical climate
    hazards (e.g., heatwave likelihood, change in maize crop duration); Stringent
    mitigation action.
  16: Carbon intensity, carbon pricing, reduced demand for fossil fuels, physical
    risks, transition risks.
  20: Physical risks (related to climate hazards) and transition risks (related to
    shifts to a low-carbon economy) are the main drivers of risk.
  27: Fossil fuel and industry CO2 emissions, GHG emissions, population growth, changes
    in labour productivity, resources, technologies, and policies all act as drivers
    within the model.
  29: Stranding of coal plant capacity; Sectoral emissions intensity; Abatement costs;
    Carbon prices; Electricity and food prices; Fuel shares of major primary fuels;
    Mitigation costs.
  31: Exposure to drought, river flooding, heatwaves, and reductions in potential
    crop yield.
  32: Increases in global mean surface temperature leading to changes in climate patterns;
    Climate scenarios applied to observed climate time series.
Highlights:
  3: No relevant information
  4: Transition risks depend on technological, policy and socio-economic factors,
    even within the same temperature target (2oC).
  6: The scenarios and their presentation of both physical and transition risk in
    a concise, integrated framework should be of significant utility to multiple stakeholders.
  8: "Under a \"No Policy\" scenario, temperatures could rise to 4.3\xB0C by 2100.\
    \ The \"NDC Pledges\" scenario projects a 3.1\xB0C rise by 2100. Achieving the\
    \ 1.5\xB0C target requires significant changes including phasing out fossil fuels\
    \ in transport, rapid tech improvements, and behavior changes."
  12: The stringency of emissions reductions varies significantly between scenarios
    and regions, leading to varying transition risks and abatement costs. Abatement
    costs do not fully capture all macro-economic consequences, and further modelling
    is needed.
  15: Significant near-term transition risks to specific business sectors; More stringent
    mitigation action leads to higher abatement costs and sector-specific transition
    risks but lower physical climate hazards; Long-term physical climate-related damages
    lead to present-term asset devaluations; Scenarios with similar longer-term physical
    risks can have different near-term transition risks, so one scenario will not
    answer all questions.
  16: "The framework serves as a first step towards a full \u201Cscenario expansion\u201D\
    \ towards financial risk estimates."
  20: The paper explores how physical and transition risks vary across different scenarios
    and regions and how these risks can impact different sectors.
  29: Coal plant capacity stranding is a significant risk factor; Abatement costs
    and carbon prices impact economic output; Household energy costs can impact loan
    defaults.
  31: Scientific uncertainty in how a given emissions scenario translates into change
    in local climate is captured
  32: Focuses on acute (annual likelihood) and chronic (number of people exposed)
    risks of heatwaves, river floods, and water resources drought.
Methodology:
  3: No relevant information
  4: Integrated framework to explore near term (to 2030) transition risks and longer
    term (to 2050) physical risks, globally and in specific regions, for a range of
    plausible greenhouse gas emissions and associated temperature pathways.
  6: Combines a technology-rich, regionally disaggregated IAM representing energy
    system, agricultural and land-based greenhouse gas emissions, a reduced complexity
    climate model to simulate probabilistic global temperature changes over the 21st
    century, and a suite of impacts models to estimate regional climate-related physical
    hazards and impacts deriving from the temperature change pathways and their underlying
    socio-economics
  8: "Modeling of emissions and temperature changes across the 21st century under\
    \ different scenarios, including \"No Policy,\" \"NDC Pledges,\" and scenarios\
    \ targeted at meeting 1.5\xB0C, 2\xB0C, and 2.5\xB0C warming targets."
  9: The paper utilizes regional hazard and impact attributes of seven physical hazard
    indicators calculated at a 0.5x0.5o resolution and averaged to the regional scale.
    Readily-available metrics from Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are used to
    capture transition risk variables.
  12: Analysis is model-specific to GCAM (Global Change Assessment Model) but notes
    limitations and the need for further macro-modeling analysis to capture all macroeconomic
    consequences.
  15: Analysis compares physical and transition risks, can be built upon to encompass
    more scenarios and metrics; Physical risk analysis is focused on mid-century,
    but salient for present-day decisions.
  16: Integrated scenario analysis framework can be built upon by stakeholders. Downscaling
    sector-level and economy-wide outputs from IAMs to firm- and household-level financial
    risks. Calculating firm level input cost increases. Calculating loss of incomes
    of fossil fuel companies.
  20: The study uses integrated assessment and physical impacts models to produce
    risk-related output indicators for various scenarios (Extended Data Figure 1).
    The analysis considers different temperature scenarios (1.5-4oC and 2oC).
  27: The study uses GCAM (Global Change Analysis Model), an Integrated Assessment
    Model (IAM) that models the energy, economy, agriculture, land use, water, atmosphere,
    and climate systems. GCAM is a five-year time step, dynamic-recursive market equilibrium
    model, disaggregating the world into 32 geopolitical regions, 235 river basins
    and 384 agro-ecological land-use regions. GCAM version 5.1 is calibrated to a
    historic base year (2010), with trajectories to different temperatures specified
    using fossil fuel and industry CO2 constraints (and GHG constraints, in case of
    the NDCs). Emission constraints begin in 2025 (except for NDCs, which begin in
    2020). The model runs to 2100.
  29: Analysis uses metrics from Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) and diagnostic
    exercises comparing IAM characteristics. Applicable to assessing transition risks.
  31: Seven indicators of hazard and related impact across different sectors were
    calculated for each emissions scenario. All are based on spatially-explicit global-scale
    impacts models. The indicators represent exposure to drought, river flooding,
    heatwaves, and reductions in potential crop yield. All impacts are calculated
    over a 30-year period. Each indicator is characterised by damage functions relating
    indicator to increase in global mean surface temperature, calculated separately
    from climate scenarios constructed from 23 CMIP5 climate models.
  32: Uses scaled climate scenarios based on pattern-scaling applied to 1981-2010
    climate data; Mac-PDM.09 global hydrological model simulates river flows; Standardised
    Runoff Index (SRI) used to represent drought risk; Risk calculated at a 0.5x0.5
    degree scale.
More Notes:
  3: The title suggests the paper addresses both transition and physical risks associated
    with climate change. The authors are affiliated with institutions that conduct
    climate and economic modeling.
  4: The paper focuses on both physical and transition risks associated with climate
    change. The time horizons considered are near-term (to 2030) and long-term (to
    2050).
  6: The presentation of results is focused on the world as a whole and four key regions
    (China, USA, EU+UK and India), with additional results for additional major regions
    (Brazil, Japan, Middle East, Russia and Sub-Saharan Africa) presented in Extended
    Data and Supplementary Information.
  9: The paper avoids using aggregated damage functions due to recognized uncertainties
    and omissions.
  12: The analysis highlights that there is no set low-carbon transition pathway and
    therefore no set degree of risk to a given temperature pathway in each region.
  15: The analysis does not provide a comprehensive assessment of all future possibilities
    and uncertainties. The analysis indicates relatively little inter-scenario variation
    in the near-term for electricity and food prices.
  16: Adaptation measures are not explicitly accounted for. Analysis identifies underlying
    drivers of economic changes that result from physical and transition risks.
  20: The paper distinguishes between transition risks and transition opportunities
    (e.g., nuclear, solar, and wind capacity expansion).
  27: Land-use change emissions are priced as a proportion of the fossil emissions
    price, to reflect the limited regulatory frameworks in many countries.
  29: The paper does *not* consider the potential stimulus effect of low-carbon investment
    on economic growth.
  31: Damage functions are constructed separately for five SSP socio-economic scenarios
    and at 10-year increments.
  32: Analysis uses regional averages weighted by population in grid cells or floodplains.
    Does not include smaller floodplains, but claims proportional change is consistent.
