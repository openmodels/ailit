Highlights:
  2: No relevant information
  4: By 2050, physical risks depend greatly on the temperature pathway; By 2030, transition
    risks most sensitive to temperature pathways; Transition risks also depend on
    technological, policy and socio-economic factors.
  6: Presents a fully integrated framework to undertake a self-consistent analysis
    of physical and transition risks.
  8: Absent climate policy, temperatures could rise to 4.3oC by 2100. Current ambitions
    based on Paris pledges lead to median temperature projections of 3.1oC by 2100.
    The 1.5C scenario involves a complete phase out of liquids and natural gas from
    the transport sector after 2050.
  9: The study focuses on both acute (extreme event likelihoods) and chronic risks
    (annual average changes) associated with various climate hazards.
  10: The chance of experiencing a major heatwave and the three agricultural indicators
    have the most highly non-linear relationships with temperature. India experiences
    the greatest differences in the chance of river flooding and agricultural drought
    frequency between the NDC Pledges and 2C Central scenarios.
  11: NDC Pledges scenario leads to consistently 20-30% greater regional reductions
    in maize yield compared to the 2C Central scenario in some regions.
  12: The 1.5C scenario generally has higher transition risk metrics than other scenarios
    globally, except for electricity and crop prices. The NDC Pledges scenario for
    the EU+UK and USA is more stringent than the 2C Central scenario in terms of emissions
    reductions by 2030, leading to higher transition risk metrics. There is no set
    low-carbon transition pathway, and therefore no set degree of risk, to a given
    temperature pathway in each region.
  13: Even scenarios aimed at the same temperature goal can have considerably different
    transition risks by 2030.
  14: Identifies significant 2030 transition risk variation, especially under regionally
    uncoordinated socio-economics in specific scenarios.
  15: Scenarios with similar longer-term physical risks could have very different
    near-term transition risks
  16: The paper provides a framework for understanding both physical and transition
    risks associated with different emissions pathways and serves as a foundation
    for further analysis, including identifying underlying drivers of economic changes.
  18: "The paper explores a range of climate scenarios, including those aligned with\
    \ the Paris Agreement (2\xB0C) and more ambitious targets (1.5\xB0C), as well\
    \ as a 'No Policy' scenario leading to significant warming. It also considers\
    \ different socio-economic pathways (SSPs) and technological portfolios."
  19: The analysis highlights the potential impact of various physical hazards on
    human health, livelihoods, and economic assets, as well as the transition risks
    associated with climate change mitigation policies.
  27: GCAM calculates the CO2 prices required to meet the emissions constraint imposed
    in each model period.
  28: The study focuses on a subset of integrated assessment model (IAM) outputs to
    capture the most salient transition risk-related variables, drawing from indicators
    tracking progress towards the Paris Agreement goals.
  29: Metrics from IAM diagnostic exercises are useful for measuring transition risks,
    including mitigation costs, emissions intensity, and fuel shares.
  31: The distributions of risk are compared at a place for a given scenario with
    the risks under the 2C Central scenario. The approach represents scientific uncertainty
    in how an emissions scenario translates into local climate.
  33: The global average likelihood of a 'significant' drought at a place is around
    6% (in 1981-2010). The global average likelihood of an agricultural drought is
    around 9-10%. A reduction in crop growth duration of at least 10 days corresponds
    to a reduction in potential yield of approximately 8%. The global average likelihood
    of experiencing at least five days with damaging temperatures during the maize
    reproductive phase is around 5%.
  34: Three archetypes of emissions pathways are explored, with different warming
    impacts and associated risks.
  35: Explores divergent policy implementation pathways to achieve the 2oC goal; considers
    technology variations, and scenarios with higher (~2.5oC) warming; includes a
    specific 1.5oC scenario focusing on rapid electricity decarbonisation and electrification
    of end use sectors.
Methodology:
  2: No relevant information
  4: Integrated framework to explore near term (to 2030) transition risks and longer
    term (to 2050) physical risks, globally and in specific regions.
  6: Combines a technology-rich, regionally disaggregated IAM, a reduced complexity
    climate model, and a suite of impacts models. Uses 11 scenarios to explore a range
    of temperature outcomes as well as socio-economic and technological choices for
    a set of 2oC temperature target pathways.
  8: Analysis uses scenarios based on different temperature targets (1.5oC, 2oC, 2.5oC,
    3oC, and 4oC) to project temperature changes across the 21st century, as well
    as different variants targeting 2oC warming.
  9: Calculates and averages regional hazard likelihoods and change in maize crop
    duration at a 0.5x0.5o resolution. Likelihood indicators are interpreted as acute
    risks, and impacts are expressed as annual averages to characterize chronic risks.
  10: Metrics are normalized by values in 2050 (physical risk) and 2030 (transition
    risk) with the 2C Central scenario. Assumes the significance of the change in
    metric is directly proportional to the change. Reference period for physical climate
    impacts is 1981-2010.
  11: Calculated ratios of physical risk in each scenario compared to the 2C Central
    scenario from median estimates of the indicators.
  12: The analysis is performed using the GCAM model, and the results are specific
    to this model and applicable to the year 2030. The paper also refers to a range
    of 2oC scenario variants.
  13: Exploration of transition dynamics across a range of 2oC-targeted scenarios
    using a wider range of indicators.
  14: "Analysis compares illustrative 1.5oC and 2oC-targeted pathways against IPCC\u2019\
    s SR1.5 database scenarios for various transition indicators."
  15: The physical risk analysis is focused on mid-century
  16: The analysis uses an integrated scenario analysis framework that could be built
    upon to estimate financial risks. It aims to translate sector-level and economy-wide
    outputs from integrated assessment models (IAMs) to firm- and household-level
    risks.
  17: The study uses GCAM (Global Change Assessment Model) and MAGICC (Model for the
    Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change) to project climate scenarios.
    Climate impact models are also run. Scenario data analysis and visualization were
    performed.
  18: The analysis utilizes different scenarios with varying policy assumptions, socio-economic
    pathways (SSPs), and technological preferences to model future climate outcomes.
    The scenarios cover the period from 2010 to 2100.
  19: The analysis considers physical hazard indicators for 2050 and transition risk
    indicators for 2030, relative to a 'No Policy' scenario. The likelihood of physical
    hazard indicators is benchmarked against their current occurrence rates. The methodology
    is applicable to assessing the impact of climate change under different temperature
    change pathways and socio-economic development scenarios.
  27: Uses GCAM (Global Change Analysis Model), an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM).
    GCAM is calibrated to a historic base year (2010), with trajectories to different
    temperatures specified using fossil fuel and industry CO2 constraints (and GHG
    constraints, in case of the NDCs). All emission constraints are assumed to begin
    in 2025 (except for the NDCs, which begin in 2020). Solves for the equilibrium
    prices and quantities of various energy, agricultural, and CO2/GHG markets in
    each five-year model period from 2010 (the calibration year) to 2100 at different
    spatial resolutions. Land-use change emissions are priced as a proportion of the
    fossil emissions price.
  28: GCAM tracks emissions of 24 GHGs, aerosols, and short-lived species endogenously
    based on resulting energy, agriculture, and land systems activity, although a
    separate climate module and impacts models are used for subsequent steps.
  29: The analysis uses Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) outputs and diagnostic exercises
    to compare IAM characteristics. It considers indicators of the feasibility of
    the transition, like abatement costs and carbon prices. The results are applicable
    to measuring transition risks associated with climate change mitigation.
  30: Climate modelling is done by running emissions scenarios through a probabilistic
    variant of the MAGICC4.2 simple climate model, incorporating uncertainties by
    perturbing parameters like equilibrium climate sensitivity, ocean mixing rate,
    and climate-carbon cycle feedback strength.
  31: Spatially-explicit global-scale impacts models are used to calculate seven hazard
    indicators for each emissions scenario, with impacts calculated over a 30-year
    period. Damage functions relate indicators to global mean surface temperature
    increases. These functions are combined with probability distributions of temperature
    change from 23 CMIP5 climate models.
  33: Drought is calculated using SPEI6 over 6 months, with significant drought defined
    as at least three months with SPEI6 < -1.5. Crop yield potential is related to
    the time taken for maize to accumulate growing degree-days. Analysis uses a reference
    period of 1981-2010. Regional averages are calculated by averaging over populated
    cells or weighting by cropland area.
  34: The analysis expands NGFS scenarios by exploring variations in socio-economic
    trends, including green growth and challenging paradigms, and adding disorderly
    scenarios through regional fragmentation and staged accession.
  35: Explores various scenarios of climate mitigation and technology deployment using
    the GCAM model.

    2008)

    that is supposed to be sensitive to global warming.'

    the University of Reading. It does not contain any specific information related
    to direct climate impacts or their evaluation.
  4: The paper considers several pathways with a 2oC target.
  5: This page primarily discusses the importance of integrated assessments of both
    transition and physical climate risks. It argues that current analyses often separate
    these two aspects, making it difficult to understand the holistic implications
    of different pathways. The paper doesn't present its own analysis or results,
    but rather highlights the need for more integrated approaches and mentions the
    NGFS scenarios as an example.
  6: The analysis focuses on the world as a whole and four key regions (China, USA,
    EU+UK and India), with additional results for other major regions in Extended
    Data and Supplementary Information.
  8: The 'No Policy' scenario is a hypothetical reference, not an estimate of current
    emission trends. The 2C SSP3 scenario does not achieve a long-term temperature
    increase below 2 oC with median likelihood due to a lack of land use policy and
    slow improvements in carbon and energy intensity.
  11: Ratios presented are median estimates with an uncertainty range, based on the
    relationship between temperature and the metric. Extended Data Figures 2 and 3,
    and Supplementary Figures S4.1-S4.10 provide additional information.
  13: The technology and sector-specific dynamics governing any 2oC-targeted pathway
    are by no means a given, but rather depend on the particular scenario features,
    and it is imperative for any risk assessment to consider these nuances.
  15: The analysis compares physical and transition risks; mitigation action results
    in higher abatement costs and sector-specific transition risks, but lower physical
    climate hazards
  16: The paper acknowledges the importance of adaptation measures, but they are not
    explicitly included in the analysis. Systemic risk and insurance against losses
    are identified as critical considerations.
  17: The study involves a scenario design and modelling protocol. The study was funded
    by ClimateWorks Foundation and the H2020 European Commission Project PARIS REINFORCE.
  18: The scenarios differ in their assumptions regarding policy implementation, international
    cooperation, technological development (renewables, nuclear, CCS), and socio-economic
    trends (based on SSPs). Some scenarios explore disorderly transitions and fragmented
    regional approaches to mitigation.
