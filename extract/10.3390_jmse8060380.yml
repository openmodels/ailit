Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts, sea level rise, and changes to the frequency and intensity
    of storms increase coastal land and assets exposed to coastal erosion.
  5: Climate change leading to shoreline change.
  9: Sea level rise.
  10: Sand volume loss from beaches, influenced by factors like Tweed River training
    walls.
  11: Sand trapped by extended Tweed River training walls between 1960 and 2000
  12: Sea level rise (implied by shoreline recession due to sand trapping).
  13: Sea level rise (SLR) associated with IPCC RCP scenarios.
  14: Sea level rise (SLR) under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)
    (2.6, 4.5, 6, 8.5).
  16: Sea level rise.
Highlights:
  1: The expected costs of implementing coastal protection increase significantly
    between RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, by a factor of nearly 3 at a social discount rate of
    3%, and by a factor of more than 6 at a social discount rate of 1%.
  5: Historical data can be used to estimate the cost of adaptation measures like
    beach nourishment in response to climate change.
  10: The paper aims to relate sand volume loss to shoreline recession and then to
    sea level rise equivalent using established models.
  11: Extended Tweed River training walls are contributing to beach recession on the
    southern Gold Coast, with an estimated 62m of recession between 1960 and 2000
    without intervention.
  12: Coastal hazard adaptation is often reactive, localized, and funded by mixed
    public and private sources, rather than planned and strategic. The cost of a 'defend'
    approach can be calculated over time, similar to 'adaptation pathways'.
  13: The cost of coastal protection against sea level rise varies significantly depending
    on the RCP scenario and discount rate; Under a 3% discount rate, the net present
    value of coastal protection in a beached, urban area is estimated to be $574,000/km
    under RCP 2.6 and $1.715 million/km under RCP 8.5.
  14: The cost of coastal protection varies significantly depending on the RCP scenario.
    For example, under RCP 2.6, the NPV is $713,000, while under RCP 8.5, it is $502,000
    (but much larger future value). The cost per kilometer also varies.
  16: Australian local government areas have favorable asset-to-liability ratios and
    low levels of debt, and can potentially borrow against a robust revenue base.
Methodology:
  1: The study uses historical data on coastal protection works on the Gold Coast
    between 1964 and 1999, analyzes shoreline changes using the Bruun model to determine
    implied sea level rise, and updates project costs based on projected sea level
    rise timing.
  5: Statistical relationship between site characteristics and overall project cost
    developed from historical data to estimate costs of beach nourishment projects
    as a result of climate change. The study uses historical data on beach nourishment
    projects to predict future costs.
  9: Relating the experience of change to the climate change impact under examination.
    Using past profile measurements to understand shoreline movement due to sea level
    rise, accounting for human interference.
  10: 'Shoreline recession is calculated using Equation (1): R = Qe / (h1 + 0.5h2),
    where Qe is erosion quantity, h1 is height of frontal beach ridge, h2 is depth
    of closure, and R is long-term erosion rate. Sea level rise equivalent of the
    shoreline recession is calculated using the Bruun model (Equation 2).'
  11: Uses a rearranged Bruun rule equation (Equation 3) to calculate sea level rise
    (S) based on landward retreat (R), closure depth (h), horizontal distance from
    shoreline to offshore position of h (L), and height of the frontal dune (B). Original
    Bruun rule equation also shown.
  12: Uses a base case of historical defensive responses to shoreline erosion on the
    Gold Coast to estimate the costs of a 'defend' approach to sea level rise adaptation.
    The Bruun model is used to establish a comparison between shoreline change and
    equivalent sea level rise. An economic model is then developed to estimate the
    future value cost, per kilometre, of a defensive approach for sea level rise.
  13: Economic model estimating costs of coastal protection (seawalls, groynes, beach
    nourishment) based on historical projects on the Gold Coast, projected sea level
    rise scenarios, and discounting future costs; applicable to predominantly beached,
    urban coastal areas.
  14: Estimation of indicative costs to implement a coastal protection strategy involving
    seawalls, groynes, and beach nourishment for each IPCC RCP at a predominantly
    beached, urban location. Costs are representative of distributed, generally reactive,
    and adaptive decision-making at a highly local scale.
  16: Analysis assumes a consistent beach profile.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on a specific coastal protection strategy for sandy beach shorelines
    and calculates the NPV per kilometer.
  11: The paper acknowledges limitations of the Bruun rule related to data quality,
    data period, and sediment budget quantification, framing these as critiques of
    application rather than the model itself.
  12: The analysis focuses on a specific location (Southern Gold Coast Beaches) and
    a specific hazard (sea level rise equivalent of recession due to sand trapping).
    It contrasts actual historical responses with planned, strategic approaches.
  13: Costs are expressed in 2016 USD, and the model considers inflation and maintenance
    costs for seawalls and groynes; Sensitivity analyses were conducted using discount
    rates of 1% and 7.5%.
  14: The analysis assumes that future decision-making for coastal protection will
    broadly align with past practices. The case study focuses on the southern Gold
    Coast, Australia. The method does not compare costs to accumulated benefits.
  16: Adaptation will be funded through a combination of both private and public funding.
    The relative burden between the two is dependent on specific local issues, however,
    it is likely that much of the burden, in Australia, will fall to local governments.
