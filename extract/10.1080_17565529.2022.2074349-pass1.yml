Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change damages both on sectoral productivity and on labour availability.
  3: Climate change (temperature increases), asymmetric impacts of climate change
    on labour availability (female/male and high-skilled/low-skilled labour), sectoral
    productivity (high-exposure/low-exposure sectors)
  4: Weekly maximum temperature.
  5: Change in temperature (weekly maximum temperature), precipitation
  6: The drivers of risk are maximum temperature and total precipitation.
  7: Weekly maximum temperature.
  8: Cumulative precipitation in the previous 12 months; Maximum weekly temperature.
  9: Climate change impacts on labour availability and sectoral productivity are key
    drivers.
  10: Climate change impacts on labor supply, particularly affecting low-skilled female
    labor; Different RCP scenarios representing different climate pathways
  11: Climate change impacts on labor supply and sectoral productivity
  14: Temperature changes, gender, skill level, health condition, age, marital status,
    years of schooling, income
  16: Maximum temperatures affecting labor supply; Average temperatures affecting
    sectoral productivity.
  17: Mean temperature change, climate change impacts on both demand and supply sides
    of the labor market.
  19: The page does not address specific shocks or changes impacting macroeconomic
    outcomes.
Highlights:
  2: Climate-induced reduction in labour availability increases the relative wages
    of low-skilled female labour and reduces the wage gap between male and female
    labour in the high-exposure sector.
  3: Climate change decreases the relative availability of female low-skilled labour.
    A reduction in labour availability causes the relative wages of low-skilled female
    labour to increase, which closes the wage gap between male and female low-skilled
    labour as well as the wage gap between low-skilled and high-skilled female labour.
    Relative gains from closing the gender pay gap are likely to be compensated by
    the overall negative impact of climate change on economic output.
  4: Evidence that maximum temperature increases above 30 degrees Celsius may have
    a negative impact on labour supply. The study focuses on gender-differentiated
    impacts. Weekly labour supply in South Africa is more responsive to weekly maximum
    temperature instead of mean temperature.
  5: Optimal temperature for female labour supply is lower than for male labour supply,
    meaning future increases in maximum temperature are likely to have a greater adverse
    impact on female working hours. Labour supply in high-exposure sector is maximized
    at a lower temperature than in the low-exposure sector.
  6: Maximum temperature has a statistically significant impact on labor supply, but
    total precipitation does not. The relationship between temperature and labor supply
    is non-linear.
  7: Negative impacts of temperature on labour supply are higher for women.
  8: Cumulative precipitation has a positive impact on total income in South Africa.
    Optimal weekly temperatures maximizing labour supply are lower than those estimated
    from OLS regression.
  9: Long-term wage inequality is driven by damages to labour availability, while
    short-term wage shocks are caused by damages to both labour availability and sectoral
    productivity.
  10: Climate change disproportionately impacts low-skilled female labor; Under all
    RCP scenarios, the wage gap between high-skilled and low-skilled labor decreases
    for both genders, but the decline is more noticeable among female labors.
  11: Climate change reduces the relative availability of low-skilled labor in high-exposure
    sectors, leading to wage increases for this group, especially women, and closing
    the gender pay gap. However, the overall impact of climate change on the economy
    remains negative due to damages to labor availability and sectoral productivity.
  14: "Higher temperatures (above 25-30\xB0C) negatively impact labor supply across\
    \ all skill levels and genders. The impact of temperature on labor supply varies\
    \ non-linearly."
  16: Climate change impacts both the supply of and the demand for labor in both sectors.
    Damages to labor availability are related to maximum temperature instead of mean
    temperature. Sectoral productivity impacts of temperature rise are also considered.
  17: Climate change impacts are mainly driven by the change in labor supply through
    the supply factor. Optimal mean temperatures for productivity in high and low
    exposure sectors are identified. The model projects relative changes in output
    per adult under different climate change scenarios (RCPs).
  19: The wage ratios remain constant over time and across different scenarios in
    the climate demand model but vary in the climate supply model due to non-uniform
    effects of climate change on the supply factor.
Methodology:
  2: The study develops a structural model, calibrated with empirical evidence from
    South Africa (2008-2017) micro-survey data.
  3: The paper uses an overlapping generations (OLG) model with different types of
    labour based on skill and gender. It analyses the prospect of wage inequality
    among different labour types and gender under moderate demographic projections
    of the second Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2) (Lutz 2017) and different temperature
    trajectories driven from four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (Moss
    et al. 2010).
  4: Econometric analysis using a truncated Poisson model and panel data from the
    National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) to investigate the impact of weekly maximum
    temperature on the number of hours worked. Fixed effects are included.
  5: Econometric analysis (regression model) of household-level data (NIDS) in South
    Africa to estimate the impact of temperature on labour supply. OLG (Overlapping
    Generations) model is calibrated using the marginal effects of temperature on
    labor.
  6: The analysis uses regression models to estimate the impact of temperature and
    precipitation on labor supply, controlling for age, marital status, education,
    health condition, log of income, and other factors, using household, week and
    year-season fixed effects.
  7: Two-stage least squares (2SLS) using cumulative precipitation in the 12 months
    before the interview as an instrument for total income.
  8: Uses a simple Overlapping Generations (OLG) model with two genders, two skill
    levels, and two economic sectors. Employs a 2SLS regression to estimate the impact
    of temperature on labour supply through income, instrumenting total income with
    cumulative precipitation. Uses household and time fixed effects. The study uses
    individual and household-level responses from South Africa.
  9: An overlapping generations (OLG) model is used to project impacts on the labor
    market, considering wage dynamics, child-rearing costs, and sectoral productivity.
  10: 'The analysis develops two cases: a Reference case with unchanged climate conditions
    and a case investigating climate change damages to labor supply under four different
    RCP scenarios; It examines the effect of different climate pathways on labor supply
    and wage differences; Empirical analysis in Section 2 and Equations (A4) and (A5)
    in the appendix are referenced.'
  11: Calibration of an Overlapping Generations (OLG) model using empirical evidence
    from South Africa to study the future impact of climate and socioeconomic changes
    on gender pay gap and output.
  14: Uses individual survey data to estimate the loss in labor supply due to increases
    in mean temperature. A theoretical model is used incorporating utility maximization
    of consumption and future children's well-being, factoring in climate change impacts
    on labor supply.
  16: Calibration of a model using initial wages, temperature data, and RCP scenarios
    to analyze the effect of future carbon concentrations on wage dynamics. The model
    accounts for sectoral productivity impacts of temperature and labor supply impacts.
    Skill ratio projections from SSP2 are used to estimate labor distribution in 2100.
  17: The paper uses an Overlapping Generations (OLG) model calibrated to historical
    data. The model considers climate impacts on both demand and supply sides of the
    labor market.
  19: "The analysis involves comparing two models\u2014climate supply model and climate\
    \ demand model\u2014to evaluate impacts on gender pay gap and wage ratios under\
    \ various RCP scenarios."
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on the gender dimension of climate change and its impact on
    women's labour force availability, especially in high-exposure sectors like agriculture
    in developing countries. Adaptation policies that build on the potential benefits
    of climate change in reducing gender inequality and empowering women are called
    for.
  4: The study uses climate data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)
    v2.1. The analysis controls for precipitation, age, education, health, household
    income, year-season, week and household-level fixed effects. The analysis is performed
    separately for labour in low and high-exposure sectors.
  5: Focus on labour supply, not equilibrium wage adjustments. Unemployment not considered
    as an alternative to decreased working hours, which may limit implications for
    wage adjustments. Analysis controls for weekly precipitation, but it is not statistically
    significant.
  6: The analysis is split by gender and high/low exposure sectors. The included figures
    show non-linear relationships between maximum weekly temperature and labor supply
    with confidence intervals.
  7: The analysis differentiates between high-exposure and low-exposure sectors.
  8: The model differentiates optimal temperature levels between male and female workers
    in the high-skilled sector.
  9: The model incorporates the quantity-quality trade-off in education decisions
    made by parents in response to climate change.
  10: The analysis focuses on South Africa.
  11: The analysis focuses on South Africa and assumes a clear labor division between
    high-exposure (agriculture, low-skilled labor) and low-exposure (manufacturing,
    high-skilled labor) sectors. The potential impacts of future gender pay equalizing
    policies are not considered.
  14: The model incorporates altruistic preferences of parents for their children's
    future earnings and includes a quantity-quality trade-off in child-rearing decisions,
    with child-rearing costs differing for children of different genders and skill
    levels.  The study also accounts for how the share of time spent child rearing
    impacts labor supply.
  17: The model incorporates fertility and education decisions to determine the composition
    of the labor force.
  19: The stability in gender-related wage and supply ratios over time suggests persistent
    gender disparities despite climate change dynamics.
