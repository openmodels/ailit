Drivers of Risk:
  1: Environmental changes including climate change, air pollution, water scarcity,
    and salinization are impacting agricultural production.
  6: Environmental changes affecting nutritional quality of vegetables and legumes,
    changes in ambient temperature, and tropospheric CO2 concentrations.
Highlights:
  1: Environmental change would negatively impact yields of non-staple vegetables
    and legumes without suitable agricultural adaptation strategies.
  6: Found substantial yield declines for non-staple vegetables and legumes at high
    baseline temperatures; evidence of varying impacts on nutritional quality by environmental
    exposure and crop type.
Methodology:
  1: Systematic review and meta-analysis of published articles from 1975 to 2016,
    analyzing experimental studies on environmental change impacts on yields and nutritional
    quality of vegetables and legumes.
  6: Systematic search of literature using multiple databases, focusing on experimental
    studies and standardizing environmental impacts; evaluation includes meta-analysis
    and threshold analysis for specific factors.
More Notes:
  1: Focus on non-staple crops which are important for diet but less studied than
    staple crops.

    \ in O3; -34.7% for 50% reduction in water; -2.3% for 25% increase in salinity;\
    \ -31.5% for 4\xB0C temperature increase in areas with baseline temperatures >20\xB0\
