Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (extreme rainfall increase, sea level rise), population growth
    in at-risk areas, insured value growth in at-risk areas.
  2: Extreme rainfall leading to increased frequency and intensity of catastrophic
    events; sea-level rise increasing exposure of coastal regions to storm surge.
  5: Storm surge, continental flooding, coastal flooding, rainfall events (72-h and
    10-days), atmospheric pressure, wind speed, population growth, territorial dynamics.
  6: Flooding (runoff and storm surge), sea level rise, population growth.
  7: Meteorological conditions (flooding, storm surge) and vulnerability conditions,
    including sea-level rise (SLR), are primary drivers. Future climate scenarios
    project increasing runoff and coastal flooding, impacting insurance losses.
  8: Increase in precipitations (floods), rise of sea level (storm surge), demographic
    evolution (population growth in vulnerable areas), rise of insured good values.
Highlights:
  1: Global loss increase in 2050 due to climatic factors, population growth, and
    insured value growth.
  2: A multi-peril approach focusing on flood and storm surge is used to simulate
    the insured losses resulting from climate change in France.
  5: A fictive 2003 climate event at 2050 levels could cause over one billion in losses
    from continental flooding and 100 million from coastal flooding. Insured properties
    will increase significantly by 2050 (+11.7%), increasing the number of risks
  6: Significant regional disparities exist in the projected growth of insured values;
    areas exposed to runoff are expected to increase; sea level rise will significantly
    extend flooded areas, especially in low-relief areas.
  7: Mean annual insurance losses are projected to increase by 2050, especially under
    conditions that also consider vulnerability and sea-level rise, with multi-hazard
    scenarios showing the most significant increase in insurance losses.
  8: Increase in insured losses is driven more by demographic evolution and rise of
    insured good values than by climate change alone (under RCP 4.5).
Methodology:
  1: "Stochastic approach developed since 2011 for flood, storm surge, and drought.\
    \ Climate simulations using ARPEGE-Climate model (M\xE9t\xE9o-France) to generate\
    \ 200 years of hourly atmospheric time series for current and 2050 conditions\
    \ (RCP 4.5). Hazard and vulnerability models used to compute continuous loss estimations,\
    \ considering development scenarios (demographic growth and insured values evolution)."
  2: Combining climate projections from the ARPEGE-Climate model with CCR's hazard
    and damage models to simulate 200 fictive years under current (2000) and future
    (2050) climatic conditions to estimate insured losses from flood and storm surge
    in France.
  5: Flood modeling at two catchment scales (small watershed and large watershed)
    for 72 h and 10-days rainfall events; thresholds based on the 97th percentile
    over the tide predicted by the OTPS model, the 1st percentile over atmospheric
    pressure and the 99.5th percentile over wind speed, calibrated with a database
    of historical events; projection of insured property values based on INSEE projections.
  6: Extrapolation of historical insurance data (CCR historical insurance database
    over the past 10 years) to project future insured values; hazard maps for different
    events used to build a probabilistic hazard map; effects of sea level rise modeled.
  7: The analysis assesses the variation of mean annual insurance losses based on
    meteorological and vulnerability conditions under different climate scenarios
    (2050). It uses box plots to display the distribution of losses, including median,
    quartiles, and outliers.
  8: Simulation of insured losses due to climatic disasters (continental and coastal
    flood hazard and damages) at an infra-communal scale, using the RCP 4.5 scenario,
    projecting to 2050.
More Notes:
  1: "CCR (Caisse Centrale de R\xE9assurance) is a French reinsurance company. Models\
    \ are used to estimate insurance losses and are systematically used for all major\
    \ climatic events."
  2: The study considers the evolution of insurance exposure (vulnerability) as a
    key component of damage estimation.
  5: The study uses a 'fictive' event that 'occurred in 2003 (at climate 2050),' suggesting
    a scenario analysis based on historical data scaled to future climate conditions.
    The analysis focuses on France.
  6: The analysis does not account for soil sealing, diminution of natural water storage
    areas, future prevention and protection measures (dikes, dams), or coastal erosion
    and accretion.
  7: The study focuses on the impact of climate change (runoff and coastal flooding)
    on insurance losses in France. The Vulnerability (Vul) parameter seems to contribute
    to bigger insurance losses than the SLR parameter.
  8: The study acknowledges that the choice of the RCP 4.5 scenario impacts the conclusions
    and that a more pessimistic scenario (RCP 6.0) will be simulated in the next phase
    of the project.

    discussed on this page. The paper only describes the methodology for modelling
    flood hazards and damage.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Insurance losses due to flood and storm surge in France.
  2: Financial impacts of climate change for natural disaster insured losses in France.
  5: 'Economic losses due to a fictive event in 2003 (at climate 2050): more than
    one billion for continental flooding and 100 million for coastal flooding in France.'
  6: Insured values (as a proxy for economic assets at risk) at the municipality level.
  7: Mean annual insurance losses are quantified in million euros for flooding, storm
    surge, and multi-hazard scenarios.
  8: Increase in insured losses due to climatic disasters (flood and storm surge).
Quantitative material:
  1: The simulations show a global loss increase in 2050.
  5: Losses exceeding one billion for continental flooding and 100 million for coastal
    flooding; insured properties increasing from nearly 51 million in 2015 to almost
    57 million in 2050 (+11.7%).
  6: Insured values would grow by 72% between 2015 and 2050.
  7: The study provides quantitative estimates of mean annual insurance losses in
    million euros under different scenarios (Actual, 2050, 2050.Vul/SLR) for flooding,
    storm surge, and multi-hazard events, including median losses (e.g., median flood
    loss in 2050.Vul is 1138 million euros).
  8: "Damages from floods increase by 20% between current and 2050 climates. Annual\
    \ amount of damages generated by both flood and storm surge will rise from 855\
    \ to 1325 M\u20AC (~+55%). Increase of precipitations or the rise of sea level\
    \ will play a smaller part (~20%) in the global increase."
