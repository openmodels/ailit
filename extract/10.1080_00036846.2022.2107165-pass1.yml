Drivers of Risk:
  2: Impact of Climate Change in the MENA Region.
  4: Changes in temperature, humidity, and precipitation.
  6: Changes in temperature, humidity, and precipitation.
  8: Changes in meteorological indicators (maximum temperature, relative humidity),
    climate change, sea level rise, heat extremes.
  12: Temperature, humidity, and precipitation changes.
  13: Climate variability, specifically average maximum temperature.
  14: Weekly average maximum temperature, weekly average relative humidity, age, gender,
    education level, and exposure to climate.
  15: Temperature and humidity variations are the main drivers of risk.
  17: Weekly average maximum temperature, Weekly average relative humidity, Weekly
    average precipitation
  18: No relevant information
  19: Weekly average maximum temperature, weekly average maximum temperature squared,
    weekly average relative humidity, weekly average relative humidity squared, weekly
    average precipitation, weekly average precipitation squared are being used as
    drivers. Age, gender, and level of education of the respondent are also used.
  20: None explicitly mentioned, but the analysis controls for month, year of visit,
    and governorate of the respondent, suggesting potential time and location-based
    influences.
  21: Changes in weekly average maximum temperature, relative humidity, precipitation,
    age, gender, and education levels are analyzed for their impact on labor working
    hours.
  22: Weekly average maximum temperature is identified as a driver impacting hours
    worked.
  23: Changes in average humidity levels.
  24: Changes in temperature and relative humidity.
Highlights:
  4: Changes in temperature and humidity have a significant impact on labor working
    hours, while precipitation has no significant effect. The marginal impact of temperature
    and humidity differs between high-risk and low-risk groups. Working hours are
    impeded by heat and humidity after a specific threshold.
  8: Some Mediterranean coastal governorates (Damietta, Port Said, Nabeula, Sousse,
    Tunis, Madaba) are particularly vulnerable and experiencing more risk than other
    governorates.
  12: The study investigates the causal impact of temperature, humidity, and precipitation
    changes on labor supply, differentiating between high-risk and low-risk occupations.
  13: Climate variability impacts labor supply. Negative binomial regression is considered
    a better fit than Poisson regression for modelling this relationship due to overdispersion.
  14: Higher temperature is associated with more working hours up to a point, beyond
    which it reduces working hours. Higher humidity reduces working hours. Females
    work fewer hours than males. Higher education beyond the basic level is associated
    with reduced working hours.
  15: Climate variability, particularly temperature and humidity, has a stronger negative
    impact on labor market hours in high-risk groups (e.g., agriculture, mining) compared
    to low-risk groups.
  17: Weekly average maximum temperature and its square, weekly average relative humidity
    and its square all have significant impacts.
  18: Constant is statistically significant at p < 0.01 level across all three columns.
  19: Weekly average maximum temperature and its square are significant predictors
    in all three models. Age, gender, and education levels of the respondent are also
    significant predictors across the models.
  20: Household wealth score is statistically significant (p < 0.01) in the regressions.
  21: Key findings include significant effects of temperature, humidity, age, gender,
    and education on labor hours, with varying impacts between high-risk and low-risk
    samples.
  22: The graphs indicate an inverted U-shaped relationship between weekly average
    maximum temperature and linear prediction for both 'High-Risk Group' and 'Low-Risk
    Group', peaking around 35 degrees. Higher temperatures initially increase the
    'linear prediction' until a certain point, after which further increases reduce
    it.
  23: The study indicates that increased humidity has a negative impact on the 'high-risk'
    group's linear prediction (potential economic productivity), while the 'low-risk'
    group is relatively unaffected.
  24: "Temperature has a non-linear effect on labor supply (optimized at 22/26\xB0\
    C), and relative humidity has a negative effect for high-risk groups. The study\
    \ emphasizes the importance of understanding the relationship between changes\
    \ in climate indicators and labor supply in the MENA region."
Methodology:
  4: The study uses Integrated Labor Market Panel Surveys of Egypt, Jordan, and Tunisia
    spanning the period 2006-2018 matched with a globally gridded climate dataset.
    It differentiates between high-risk and low-risk groups based on exposure to climate.
  8: Exploiting the spatial and temporal variation in observations of meteorological
    indicators and hours worked per week.
  10: The analysis is performed by estimating coefficients of explanatory variables
    using maximum likelihood estimation.
  11: The analysis uses negative binomial regression to address overdispersion in
    count data, compared to Poisson regression, using maximum likelihood estimation.
  12: Regression analysis exploiting spatial and temporal variation in climate data
    and individual labor supply. Workers are divided into high-risk and low-risk groups
    based on their occupation's exposure to climate (ISIC-4 classification). Includes
    individual-level controls (age, gender, education, wealth) and fixed effects (month,
    governorate, year).
  13: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Poisson regression with robust standard errors,
    and negative binomial regressions are used to examine the impact of climate variability
    on labor supply. Negative binomial regression is preferred due to overdispersion
    of the data.
  14: Regression analysis using a sample of 45,907 observations. Applicability is
    limited to the population sampled and the time period from which the data was
    collected.
  15: The impact of climate variables (temperature, humidity, precipitation) on labor
    working hours is analyzed while controlling for demographic and socioeconomic
    indicators. The analysis considers high-risk and low-risk groups based on their
    exposure to climate.
  18: Regressions control for the month and year of visit and governorate of the respondent.
    The Poisson regression in Column (2) uses robust standard errors to correct for
    overdispersion.
  19: The analysis uses OLS (Ordinary Least Squares), Poisson regression, and Negative
    Binomial regression models. The applicability of the results depends on the context
    of the study, which is not provided.
  20: Regression analysis is used, including a Poisson regression with robust standard
    errors. The analysis controls for month, year of visit, and governorate.
  21: A negative binomial regression is used to estimate the average marginal effects
    on labor working hours last week, with results applicable across total, high-risk,
    and low-risk samples.
  22: The analysis involves regressions controlling for the month and year of visit
    and governorate of the respondent. The graphs plot predicted margins with 95%
    confidence intervals. The regressions include variables like education level (with
    Illiterate as the reference group), household wealth score, and 'Ln (Alpha) Constant'.
  23: Matched data from an unbalanced longitudinal survey data from the ILMPSs of
    Egypt, Jordan, and Tunisia, spanning 2006-2018, along with a globally gridded
    climate dataset.
  24: Poisson and Negative Binomial regressions are used to analyze the impact of
    climate indicators on individual-level labor supply, controlling for socioeconomic
    and demographic variables. The analysis uses monthly climatology variables from
    NASA POWER (1984-2013) matched with ILMPS datasets.
More Notes:
  2: The title suggests the paper focuses on the impact of heat on labor productivity
    in the MENA region, which is relevant to a global review of macroeconomic and
    macro-fiscal risks of climate change and adaptation costs/benefits.
  4: The study focuses on the MENA region, specifically Egypt, Jordan, and Tunisia.
  6: "The ILMPS data is linked with spatial daily climate indicators. The choice of\
    \ countries is intended to offer a good representation of the MENA region. The\
    \ paper focuses on employment, unemployment, earnings, and work-time indicators\
    \ but also includes various modules that encompass indicators for parental background,\
    \ education, housing, access to services, residential mobility, migration and\
    \ remittances, time use, marriage patterns and costs, fertility, women\u2019s\
    \ decision-making and empowerment, job dynamics, savings and borrowing behavior,\
    \ and the operation of household enterprises and farms."
  8: The analysis focuses on MENA countries. The categorization of governorates by
    exceeding weekly averages of temperature, humidity, and working hours is used
    to determine vulnerability.
  12: The analysis uses weekly average of maximum temperature, average humidity, and
    average precipitation.
  13: The study uses data from Egypt (2006, 2012, 2018), Jordan (2016), and Tunisia
    (2014). The sample size is 45,907 observations. 50% of respondents have outdoor
    occupations.
  14: The paper distinguishes between a high-risk and low-risk group, and finds that
    the number of working hours for both groups are significantly impacted by temperature
    with similar quadratic relationships.  The relationship between precipitation
    and working hours is not significant.
  15: The heat index (combination of temperature and humidity) significantly reduces
    labor working hours in high-risk groups when it reaches the danger or extreme
    danger zone, but this effect is not significant for low-risk groups. Precipitation
    has no significant impact on labor working hours for either group.
  18: Reference group for education levels is Illiterate. t statistics are in parentheses.
  20: The reference group for education levels is 'Illiterate', suggesting education
    levels are likely included as independent variables in the full model, though
    they are not shown on this excerpted page. The dependent variable is not directly
    related to macro-economic aggregates. The sample size is 22,386.
  22: The meaning of 'Alpha' and the dependent variable in the regressions aren't
    clearly defined. The 'linear prediction' in the graphs isn't explicitly defined.
    The designation of 'High-Risk Group' and 'Low-Risk Group' is not explained.
  23: The study utilizes satellite-derived gridded climate data at a 2.5 x 2.5 degree
    resolution. The specific nature of the 'high-risk' and 'low-risk' groups is not
    specified on this page.
  24: The study focuses on the MENA region, especially high-risk activities with relatively
    more exposure to climate change. Future research could examine the impact of climate
    change on productivity indicators, such as total factor productivity by sector.

  12: Labor supply, measured as hours of work.
  13: Labor supply, measured as the number of hours worked per week.
  14: Number of hours worked per week.
  15: Labor market hours are used as a proxy for productivity loss.
  17: No relevant information
  18: No relevant information
  19: The outcome of interest is not explicitly stated as a macroeconomic or fiscal
    variable, but it is being predicted by weather variables, implying it is related
    to those factors. Without context, it is impossible to tell if it is economic
    in nature.
  20: None mentioned directly, but 'Household wealth score' is used as a dependent
    variable.
  22: Hours worked is an outcome of interest, based on the graphs referencing weekly
    average maximum temperature and hours worked.
  23: Impacts of climate change on economic outcomes, including economic growth and
    productivity.
  24: Potential negative impact on the economy due to climate change affecting labor
    supply.
Quantitative material:
  4: The study quantifies the impact of changes in temperature and humidity on labor
    working hours.
  6: No specific quantitative results are presented on this page.
  8: The page references Figures 2, 3, and 4, and Figure 5 maps risk zones exceeding
    certain weekly averages, but specific quantitative results are not provided on
    this page.
  13: "Average maximum temperature ranges between 9 and 44 \xB0C. Average hours worked\
    \ per week is 46, with variance 301.37."
  14: On average, the relationship between weekly average maximum temperature and
    number of hours worked is significant and positive, but at a diminishing rate
    (quadratic relationship). Higher humidity is associated with a reduction in weekly
    working hours. Older ages are associated with higher hours of work but at a diminishing
    rate. Working females work significantly fewer hours than males.  Respondents
    with basic education or literacy work significantly more hours than illiterate
    respondents, whereas those with a university degree or post-graduate degrees work
    significantly fewer hours relative to the illiterate respondents.
  15: "High-risk group labor market hours are maximized at 22\xB0C, while low-risk\
    \ groups are maximized at 26\xB0C. A unit increase in humidity reduces labor working\
    \ hours by -0.0065 on average in high-risk groups."
  18: 'Constant: 44.41*** (-9.68) in column (1), 3.479*** (-38.83) in column (2),
    3.472*** (-35.25) in column (3). AIC: 283,202.6 in column (2), 201,291.9 in column
    (3). BIC: 283,912.4 in column (2), 202,009.7 in column (3). Observations: 23,521.'
  19: The table provides regression coefficients and t-statistics (in parentheses)
    for various climate and socio-demographic variables. Stars indicate significance
    levels (**, ***).
  20: The table presents regression coefficients and t-statistics for the 'Household
    wealth score'. For instance, the coefficient for 'Household wealth score' in the
    first column is 0.613*** with a t-statistic of -4.55. AIC and BIC values are also
    provided for two models.
  21: The table provides coefficients and significance levels for the effects of temperature,
    humidity, and precipitation on labor working hours, based on a negative binomial
    regression.
  22: The regression table provides coefficients and t-statistics for various factors,
    including post-graduate education and household wealth score, in relation to some
    unspecified dependent variable. The graphs show a relationship between weekly
    average maximum temperature (5-50) and linear prediction (30-50) for 'High-Risk
    Group' and 'Low-Risk Group', though the units of the linear prediction are unclear.
  23: The graphs show the predicted impact of weekly average relative humidity on
    linear prediction (likely a proxy for productivity or economic output) for 'high-risk'
    and 'low-risk' groups. The high-risk group shows a downward trend in linear prediction
    as humidity increases.
  24: "Optimal temperatures for labor working hours are 22\xB0C for high-risk groups\
    \ and 26\xB0C for low-risk groups. There is an inverse relationship between relative\
    \ humidity and labor working hours in high-risk groups."
