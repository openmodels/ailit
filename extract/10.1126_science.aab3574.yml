Drivers of Risk:
  1: Local human activities, land subsidence, regional water management, global sea-level
    rise, and climate extremes.
  4: Aggregating across delta populations; heavy reliance on external financial and
    energy subsidies; reduced infrastructure investment benefits; increase in energy
    prices; increases in costs of labor and material; rising interest rates; increased
    exposure to hazardous events; anthropogenic and geophysical considerations
  5: Future changes in the intensity and distribution of hazardous events, global
    sea-level rise, land subsidence, growth in population, urbanization, and economic
    development, reduced sediment transport due to hydropower infrastructure.
Highlights:
  1: "Wealthy countries effectively limit present-day flood risk by gross domestic\
    \ product\u2013enabled infrastructure and coastal defense investments, but such\
    \ protections may prove unsustainable in an energy-constrained future, raising\
    \ relative risks."
  4: Wealthy deltas (Rhine, Mississippi, Han) benefited substantially from vulnerability
    reduction; deltas in low-GDP regions (Irrawaddy, Tana, Fly) were least sensitive
    to infrastructure investment changes and more sensitive to future risk stemming
    from hazardous events.
  5: Economic ability and decisions to deploy engineering solutions will be key factors
    in risk management.
Methodology:
  4: "Modeling a scenario with increased energy prices and adjusting IDI scores based\
    \ on 100-year projections of energy price growth in excess of GDP; starting with\
    \ each system\u2019s uncompensated R' based on anthropogenic and geophysical considerations\
    \ alone and then considering contemporary vulnerability estimates"
  5: The study uses a risk-trend analysis, examining contemporary risk and future
    risk-trend growth, considering geophysical hazards, anthropogenic change, and
    investment capacity.
More Notes:
  4: The Ganges-Brahmaputra system had the greatest rate of change in risk when aggregating
    across delta populations, and the highest R' on a per capita basis, but other
    delta systems are also impacted. A low IDI indicates a high capacity for investment
    in risk-reducing technologies.
  5: Future vulnerability scenario where investment capacity less effectively reduces
    risk trends causes high-GDP deltas' risk ranks to revert back toward expectations
    based on geophysical hazards and anthropogenic change alone.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Flood risk due to extreme events in coastal deltas
  4: Long-term sustainability of investments; costs and benefits of risk reduction;
    future vulnerability increases; risk trends
  5: Low-GDP deltas are less able to make risk-reduction investments, leading to disproportionately
    large risk impact relative to other deltas. Economic development and associated
    vulnerability reductions would result in the largest decreases in risk in some
    deltas.
Quantitative material:
  1: Relative risks in the Mississippi and Rhine deltas could increase by four to
    eight times in an energy-constrained future, and by one-and-a-half to four times
    in the Chao Phraya and Yangtze deltas.
  4: "Modernization and improvement costs across the Netherlands are projected to\
    \ reach \u20AC1 billion to \u20AC2 billion per annum over the next century."
  5: Largest increases in risk ranks occurred for the Limpopo and Irrawaddy deltas;
    Highest relative increases in future risk are in the Rhine, Mississippi, Han,
    Tone, and Chao Phraya deltas.
