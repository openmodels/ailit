Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme temperatures and storms in arid and semi-arid zones are identified as
    triggers of bilateral migration from the Global South to the OECD countries.
  2: Climatic events such as slow-onset and fast-onset events, average temperature
    increase, and extreme poverty are identified as drivers of migration.
  6: Average temperature, in celsius; Average precipitation, in mm; Dummy variables
    for drought, earthquake, landslide, storm, wildfire, extreme temperature, and
    flood.
  7: Average temperature, average precipitation, drought, earthquake, landslide, storm,
    fire, extreme temperature, and flood.
  8: Climatic variables including average temperature, average precipitation, drought,
    earthquake, landslide, storm, fire, extreme temperature, flood
  9: Climatic events such as changes in average temperature, average precipitation,
    droughts, earthquakes, landslides, storms, fires, extreme temperatures, and floods
    are considered as factors impacting international migration per capita.
  11: Average temperature, annual; Average precipitation, annual; Drought; Earthquake;
    Landslide; Storm; Fire; Extreme temperature; Flood
  12: Conflict, average annual temperature, average annual precipitation, drought,
    earthquake, landslide, storm, fire, extreme temperature, flood (all lagged by
    one period)
  13: Climate events, including storms, wildfires, and droughts, impact out-migration
    in various climatic zones and are related to poverty levels.
  14: Higher average temperatures, earthquakes, and climatic events such as droughts,
    landslides, and wildfires impact international population displacements.
Highlights:
  1: The study shows that climatic events act as significant triggers for migration
    and that their effects are robust across different tests, including division by
    levels of conflict and poverty.
  2: Climatic events have highly context-dependent impacts on migration. An increase
    in temperature is related to an increase in out-migration, while droughts reduce
    out-migration from arid regions.
  7: The study examines the heterogeneous effects of climate change on migration based
    on climatic zones, country-of-origin income levels, poverty incidence, and conflict
    presence. Analysis is limited to OECD destination countries.
  8: The decision to migrate is motivated by past events (t-1 lag) but not by too
    distant ones. Distance is related to less out-migration.
  9: Increases in average temperatures are linked to higher out-migration in the total
    sample and non-OECD, LDC, and lower-middle-income groups, but not in upper-middle-income
    countries.
  11: Droughts have a systematic impact on emigration, reducing out-migration.
  12: The impact of climate events on migration is often conditional on the presence
    of conflict, as indicated by the significant interaction terms. The effects vary
    depending on the type of climate event and the income level of the countries involved.
    For example, drought has a significant negative impact on migration in the total
    sample, Non-OECD, and Lower-middle income groups.  Extreme temperature interacts
    significantly with conflict in the total sample, Non-OECD, and LDC groupings.
  13: Climate events such as storms and wildfires promote out-migration from arid
    zones, while droughts reduce it. Conflicts and climatic events have complex interactions
    with migration.
  14: Higher average temperatures correlate with increased out-migration in general
    but reduced emigration from tropical countries and when controlling for poverty;
    earthquakes generally lead to more out-migration except in upper-middle-income
    countries where financial means to rebuild are more available.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis employs a gravity model estimated using panel data techniques to
    assess migration flows and considers heterogeneity across climatic zones.
  6: Applies a Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) method to estimate a gravity
    model to assess the impact of climatic variables on international migration.
  7: Regression analysis using yearly migration rates to OECD countries as the dependent
    variable and lagged climatic variables as independent variables. The model considers
    heterogeneous effects based on climatic zones, income levels, poverty incidence,
    and conflict presence. The analysis uses a 1-year lag for independent variables.
  8: Panel data framework with destination-year and dyadic fixed effects, robust standard
    errors clustered at the origin-destination level, gravity model.
  9: Gravity model of migration using PPML estimation; analysis distinguishes between
    income groups and includes dyadic and destination-year fixed effects.
  11: PPML estimation with dyadic and destination-year fixed effects. Standard errors
    are clustered at the origin-destination level.
  12: The analysis uses a regression model to assess the impact of climate events
    and conflict on migration, using lagged values of the drivers. The results are
    applicable to understanding the relationship between these variables across different
    country income groups.
  13: Analysis is based on PPML estimation results using bilateral migrant inflow
    per origin country population as the dependent variable.
  14: The study uses bilateral migration data to analyze the effect of climatic variables
    on international population displacements to OECD countries.
More Notes:
  6: The model uses dummy variables for least developed countries, lower-middle income
    countries, upper-middle income countries, non-OECD countries, arid climate zones,
    semi-arid climate zones, tropical-wet climate zones, tropical-dry climate zones,
    poverty headcount ratio, very high conflict, government stability, internal conflict,
    and ethnic tensions.
  7: The study uses an updated dataset covering recent extreme climatic events. The
    analysis considers both overall and heterogeneous effects of climate change on
    migration.
  8: The study does not deal with internal migration. GDP per capita, population size,
    and population growth measures in the origin countries and the ratio of GDP per
    capita (between origin and destination) were found to be consistently insignificant.
  11: 'Results are separated by climatic zones: Arid, Semi-arid, All arid, Tropical
    wet, Tropical dry, and All tropical.'
  12: The dependent variable is bilateral international migration per capita. The
    table focuses on the interaction between conflict and climate-related events.
    The asterisks indicate statistical significance levels (*, **, *** likely represent
    p < 0.1, p < 0.05, and p < 0.01, respectively, though this is not explicitly stated
    on this page).  The climate variables are all lagged by one period (t-1).
  13: The impact of climate events on migration varies across different climatic zones,
    and the presence of conflict intensifies out-migration in some areas.
