Drivers of Risk:
  1: Coastal erosion in Europe
  4: Climate change, resulting sea-level rise, and coastal erosion.
  6: Coastal erosion, sea level rise (SLR).
  10: Sea level rise (SLR), ambient shoreline change trends, and meteorological drivers
    like storm surges and waves.
  14: Sea level rise and erosion.
  17: Land cover/use changes in coastal zones due to climate change, specifically
    erosion under RCP4.5 and destruction of habitats under RCP8.5.
  18: Climate change impacts resulting from RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios
    projected for 2050 and 2100. Coastal erosion is also noted as a driver of varying
    impacts on ecosystem services.

  21: Coastal erosion
  22: Climate change impacts on ecosystem services.
  23: Land use transitions, uncertainty in ecosystem service valuation, population
    change.
  24: Demographic growth. Coastal erosion.
  30: Changes in supply and demand of ecosystem services due to ongoing erosion and
    land-use change; evolution in preferences or willingness to pay for ecosystem
    services; price inflation and movements in exchange rates; uncertain future economic
    growth and population growth.
  31: No relevant information
  51: Climate change, specifically considered through RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios
  52: Projected (2050 and 2100) climate change impacts on coastal ecosystems.
  53: Not explicitly stated, but implied to be driven by climate change impacts on
    coastal ecosystems.
  54: Coastal erosion.
  56: Land accretion, land erosion, urbanization, revitalization, agriculture expansion,
    agriculture contraction, reforestation, deforestation.
  58: Coastal erosion, future population change at national level.
  61: Coastal erosion (unconstrained and constrained by barriers).
Highlights:
  4: Salt marshes would sustain the highest absolute losses, while relative losses
    would be highest in beaches, sands, and dunes. Most affected countries in relative
    economic terms would be Denmark, Albania, Greece, Estonia, and Finland, while
    Germany, the Netherlands, and France would lose the largest share of their coastal
    ecosystem services.
  6: Land erosion leads to a loss of ecosystem services.
  17: Climate change may result in a possible loss of up to 42 billion euros per year
    in ecosystem services, with wetlands being particularly vulnerable.
  18: "Beaches, sands, and dunes are the most endangered in relative terms, potentially\
    \ experiencing a second-highest loss in annual services (up to \u20AC3.6 billion\
    \ out of \u20AC7.5 billion generated in 2018). Salt marshes also face significant\
    \ losses, both relatively and absolutely."
  20: The value of coastal ecosystem services varies substantially across European
    countries. Coastal erosion will lead to GDP and coastal service losses across
    Europe, particularly in Denmark, Germany, and Greece. The impacts of coastal erosion
    were unevenly distributed.
  21: Some countries are projected to lose a significant share of coastal ecosystem
    services (measured as % of GDP) due to coastal erosion, while others will experience
    minimal losses.
  22: Danish, German, and French regions most frequently appear on top in absolute
    terms of ecosystem service loss.
  23: Land use transitions barely changed the overall value of ecosystem services
    in Europe between 2000 and 2018, but the local effect could still be considerable.
    The biggest difference between ecosystem valuation studies was related to estimating
    the value of wetlands and forests. Projected losses in relative terms were close
    to the baseline when using medians of ecosystem service values. Future losses
    are modulated by projections of national-level population change.
  24: Uncertainty in ecosystem service loss increases by 2100 and is highly dependent
    on demographic growth scenarios. Southern and central Europe are projected to
    encounter significant demographic decline, in contrast to northern Europe.
  30: Uncertainty in coastal erosion projections is higher than the uncertainty in
    the influence of ecosystem service value aggregation methods on relative loss;
    Changes to the value of existing services would change the value of future losses
    considered in the same reference prices; Population growth has minimal influence
    on the aggregated European level relative loss.
  31: No relevant information
  51: "Total ecosystem service value in the coastal zone in 2018 is estimated at \u20AC\
    494.1 billion. This is projected to decrease by 2.2-2.4% (1.4-4.8% within the\
    \ 90% confidence interval) by 2050 and by 4.2-5.1% (3.0-8.5% within the 90% confidence\
    \ interval) by 2100."
  52: Projected loss of coastal ecosystem services as a percentage of GDP by country
    and scenario for 2050 and 2100.
  54: Loss of coastal ecosystem services is projected to be at least a certain percentage
    of 2018 GDP by 2100, based on a minimum estimate derived from the 5th percentile
    of coastal erosion projections under RCP4.5 for NUTS 3 regions.
  56: Deforestation led to the largest loss of ecosystem services between 2000 and
    2018 (-1961 million euros), while revitalization led to the largest gain (735
    million euros).
  58: Provides projected losses of coastal ecosystem services as a percentage of GDP
    for various countries under future scenarios, considering population change and
    accounting for uncertainty in coastal erosion with confidence intervals.
  61: Significant coastal ecosystem service contributions are mainly along the coastlines,
    with noticeable variations in the Baltic States, parts of Scandinavia, the UK,
    Ireland, France, Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey.
Methodology:
  1: The study likely uses modelling or projections to estimate future losses of ecosystem
    services due to coastal erosion.
  4: Used datasets derived from remote sensing products, including CORINE Land Cover
    and probabilistic coastal erosion projections constrained by artificial and topographical
    barriers. Results include historical changes (2000-2018) and projections under
    RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for 2050 and 2100.
  6: Analysis based on Special Report on Energy Scenarios (SRES) climate change scenarios
    (no longer used). Deterministic projections of erosion spanning only until the
    middle of the 21st century.
  10: Probabilistic projections of sandy shoreline dynamics are produced by combining
    projected SLR, spatial variations of active beach profile slope, ambient shoreline
    change trends, and future changes in meteorological drivers. Historical shoreline
    change trends are extrapolated from remote sensing data (Landsat images from 1984
    to 2015). A modified Bruun rule is used to estimate SLR-driven retreat.
  12: Coastal zone defined as a 10 km buffer around the coastline, extracted from
    CLC 2018 data.
  14: The study constrains erosion projections by introducing artificial and topographic
    barriers into the analysis. Artificial barriers are extracted from Imperviousness
    Density 2015 data, while topographic barriers are obtained from the EU-DEM elevation
    model.
  18: The study projects the annual value of ecosystem services under different climate
    scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for 2050 and 2100. The values presented are the
    median projections and 90% confidence intervals.
  22: The analysis projects ecosystem service losses for the year 2100 under best-case
    and worst-case scenarios.
  24: Analysis considering demographic change and its impacts on ecosystem service
    loss due to coastal erosion.
  30: Analyzes the influence of different ecosystem service value aggregation methods
    (see Section 3.4); Presents losses in relative economic terms based on most recent
    historical regional GDP data; Uses constant 2018 prices.
  31: No relevant information
  51: Median projections for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios are presented along with
    90% confidence intervals for both emission scenarios combined.
  52: Projection of ecosystem service loss.
  56: Compares the change in ecosystem services over different time periods (2000-2006,
    2006-2012, 2012-2018).
  58: Uses the expectancy of the distribution of the United Nations (2019) probabilistic
    population projections.
  61: Analyzes the impact of barriers on erosion extent at the level of transects;
    Calculates coastal ecosystem services as a percentage of GDP by NUTS 3 region.
More Notes:
  1: The paper's focus on ecosystem service losses due to coastal erosion might indirectly
    affect macroeconomic outcomes through impacts on sectors like tourism, fisheries,
    and coastal infrastructure, although the direct link to nationwide macroeconomic
    or fiscal aggregates is not explicitly stated on this page.
  4: The study highlights the urgency of undertaking mitigation actions.
  6: The study indicates these losses at a European scale but does not provide information
    on impacts at the national and local scales. Vast improvements to spatial data
    and ecosystem service valuations in recent years now enable a proper continental-scale
    analysis covering almost all coasts of Europe.
  14: The paper focuses on modeling erosion and how it can be mitigated by barriers,
    which serves as an input to understanding vulnerability but doesn't directly quantify
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes at this stage.
  17: The values for 2050 and 2100 are the median projections for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5
    and the 90% confidence interval combined for both emission scenarios. Water excludes
    the sea and ocean. Forests and semi-natural areas would be most severely affected
    in absolute terms, but wetland services would account for most losses in value.
  18: Agricultural areas associated with intensive production are expected to be the
    least affected.
  20: The analysis focuses on European countries.
  21: The coastal zone intersects with 491 NUTS 3 regions, of which 405 would be affected
    by coastal erosion in at least one scenario.
  22: The ranking of regions varied substantially depending on the method of measuring
    ecosystem loss.
  24: Subnational demographic projections were not available for all of Europe at
    the time of writing. The study focuses on the negative effects of coastal erosion.
    The study mentions data uncertainties and limitations related to land cover, erosion
    projections, ecosystem service valuation, artificial and topographical barriers
    to erosion.
  30: Study focuses on relative losses in ecosystem services to identify severely
    affected areas, acknowledging that actual losses in 2100 would likely be lower
    due to GDP increase.
  31: No relevant information
  51: The analysis focuses on ecosystem services in the coastal zone. The paper categorizes
    ecosystem services into regulating, habitat, provisioning, and cultural services.
  52: Countries listed are Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the United Kingdom.
  53: The countries of Bosnia and Herzegovina and United Kingdom are abbreviated as
    BH and UK, respectively.
  56: The processes listed are not exhaustive and may overlap.
  58: BH = Bosnia and Herzegovina, UK = United Kingdom.
  61: The analysis appears to be spatially explicit (NUTS 3 regions) and focuses on
    coastal areas. The 2018 data suggests a snapshot in time, and the supplementary
    figures might support further analyses of the relationship between constrained
    erosion and ecosystem services value.

Quantitative material:
  4: In 2018, coastal zones in Europe generated 494 billion euros of services annually.
    Future sea-level rise could erode 1.0% (0.7-1.5%) of the 2018 area under RCP4.5,
    and 1.2% (0.7-2.2%) under RCP8.5. Decline in services would be 4.2% (3.0-6.1%)
    under RCP4.5 and 5.1% (3.3-8.5%) under RCP8.5.
  6: 4500 km^2 of land eroded between 1975 and 2006; 3700-5800 km^2 projected until
    2050; Loss of 0.7 billion euros of annual ecosystem services (at 2000 price levels)
    in 2006 compared with 1975; Loss of 1.5-2.2 billion euros in 2050 compared with
    2006.
  10: Provides equation D = R + A, where D is long-term shoreline change, R is shoreline
    response to SLR, and A is ambient shoreline change.
  17: Projected land cover/use in coastal zones in 2050 and 2100 under RCP4.5 and
    RCP8.5, along with confidence intervals. Erosion may reach 5500 km^2 (3800-8600
    km^2) by 2100 under RCP4.5, while emissions under RCP8.5 could lead to the destruction
    of 7200 km^2 (4300-13000 km^2) of habitats. Decline in services would be 4.2%
    (3.0-6.1%) under RCP4.5, and 5.1% (3.3-8.5%) under RCP8.5.
  18: Historical (2000-2018) and projected (2050, 2100) values in billions of 2018
    euros are given for different ecosystem services. For 2050 and 2100, median projections
    are provided for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, along with a 90% confidence interval. Up to
    3.6 billion euros out of 7.5 billion generated in 2018 could be lost from beaches
    and dunes.
  20: Coastal ecosystem services varied substantially between countries (Figure 4).
    In 2018, the United Kingdom had the highest total in 2018, with more than 59 billion
    euros of annual service, followed by France (54 billion euros) and Italy (50 billion
    euros). For Greece, totaling 41 billion euros, accounted for more than 18% of
    GDP. Denmark was projected to lose most services relative to GDP in all scenarios,
    reaching 1.2-1.6% [0.8-2.4%] by 2100 (Figure 5). Losses of more than 0.3% of GDP
    per annum are also likely in Estonia and Finland. The highest absolute losses
    would occur in France (14-19% share in Europe depending on the scenario and percentile),
    before the United Kingdom (11-17%), Denmark (12-15%), and Germany (9-16%). Denmark
    again came on top, with projected losses of 9-12% [7-19%] by 2100, it was followed
    closely by Germany (Figure 6). The 95th percentile of the uncertainty distribution
    indicated that Germany might even lose a greater share of its coastal ecosystem
    services than any other European country (21%).
  21: Figure 4 shows coastal ecosystem services per year based on CLC 2018, in billions
    of euros and as a percentage of 2018 GDP, by country. The Netherlands was projected
    to lose a considerable share of its relatively small amount of services (8-9%
    to <7-16%) by the end of the 21st century. France, Albania, Finland, and the United
    Kingdom could all lose more than 10% of their 2018 services under certain scenarios.
    Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgium, Cyprus, Lithuania, and Montenegro would most
    likely lose no more than 1%.
  22: Many regions in various parts of the United Kingdom would also be among those
    with the highest relative impacts, together with some Dutch and Greek regions.
    In the latter country, Imathia (EL521) could suffer the highest loss among European
    regions of 65% (under the worst-case scenario).
  23: Land erosion was smaller than land accretion, but 58% of accreted land was in
    the form of artificial surfaces. Total value of ecosystem services in 2018 would
    have ranged from 50 billion euros (minimum estimate) to 1247 billion euros (maximum
    estimate). Relative losses until 2100 would be 2.5-3.1% of 2018 services under
    minimum valuation and 6.8-8.3% under maximum valuation. Using the median of estimates,
    the 2018 value of ecosystem services would be 131 billion euros, or 26% of the
    baseline estimate. Aggregated at the European level, the absolute loss of ecosystem
    services would be 4% lower in 2050 under the lowest percentile demographic growth
    compared with the baseline scenario, or 8% higher.
  24: Ecosystem loss would be 25x28 lower than in the baseline, or 7x16 higher if
    demographic growth remains in the upper range of projections, by 2100 under low
    and high demographic growth, respectively. Under the median demographic scenario,
    ecosystem service loss would be only 2x3 higher in 2050 and 3x6 lower in 2100
    than the baseline scenario.
  30: Analysis uses median values due to large variance of limited data points.
