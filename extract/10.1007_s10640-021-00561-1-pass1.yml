Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change and environmental hazards.
  5: The public impact of adoption of adaptation strategies (strategy A) on the local
    environmental indicator of each region, represented by parameters d_j (domestic
    effects) and f_j (foreign effects). These externalities might depend on technological
    factors or policies. Negative public effects from adopting strategy A can lead
    to maladaptation.
  12: Public effects, represented by coefficients dN, dS, fS, fN > 0, are negative.
    This implies that the adoption of strategy A (environmental maladaptation technology)
    has negative consequences for the well-being of the regions.
  14: Environmental dumping, adoption of maladaptation technology, exogenous factors
    (e.g., new policies like green taxes) that shift environmental burden from one
    country to another, carbon taxes, stricter environmental regulation, international
    trade and offshoring, CO2 emissions.
  20: Negative or positive externalities from adaptation technologies on both same-region
    and cross-region agents; Self-interest considerations of agents; Maladaptation
    technology shifting environmental load; Mitigation technology adoption.
Highlights:
  2: Global externalities lead to under-adoption of mitigation strategies and over-adoption
    of maladaptation strategies.
  5: Adoption of adaptation strategies creates externalities, and negative externalities
    can lead to maladaptation. The share of agents adopting a technology increases
    if it provides higher payoffs than not adopting.
  12: The paper explores scenarios where agents in each region coordinate on one of
    two strategies (A or NA). In certain scenarios, vertices of Q are attractive,
    where each region adopts a single strategy. Other scenarios, with different conditions,
    show multistability.
  14: Shifting environmental burden from one country to another might worsen the well-being
    of all agents. A green tax or policy in a more developed region decreases the
    domestic effect on the local resource but increases the foreign effect on the
    resource of the other region, further degrading it. Overall well-being effects
    of shifting pollution cannot be assessed a priori, as they depend on the relative
    magnitude of domestic effect reduction and foreign effect increase.
  20: Maladaptation technology can be over-adopted, resulting in lower well-being
    for all; Mitigation technology can be under-adopted, as full adoption would be
    Pareto optimum.
Methodology:
  2: The paper studies the dynamics of mitigation and maladaptation.
  12: The analysis examines the average level of well-being in two regions (N and
    S) based on the weighted average of the well-being of agents adopting strategy
    A and NA. The weights are determined by the share of adopters in each region.
  14: Theoretical model analyzing the adoption dynamics of an environmental maladaptation
    technology with negative public effects, comparative dynamics analysis.
  20: Model of two regions where agents adopt environmental adaptation technology
    considering domestic and foreign public effects; Focus on maladaptation and mitigation
    technologies.
More Notes:
  5: The analysis does not delve into the specific technological or policy factors
    that determine the public effects (d_j and f_j), assuming they are exogenously
    determined. The model focuses on the dynamics of adoption based on payoff differences.
  12: The paper uses a model with two regions (N and S) and two strategies (A and
    NA). The variable 'x' represents the share of adopters of strategy A in region
    N, and 'z' represents the share of adopters of strategy A in region S. The figures
    mentioned (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) visually represent different multistability scenarios
    with attractors, repellers and saddles.
  14: The model allows studying the adoption dynamics of an environmental maladaptation
    technology with negative public effects and which asymmetrically degrades the
    environmental quality indicator of one of the two regions. This specifically refers
    to adoption dynamics of a technology, not adaptation.
  20: The model excludes altruism and does not restrict the initial distribution of
    the system; the analysis is not a complete analysis of all possible specifications,
    but focuses on two salient characterisations.
No relevant information:
  10: This page focuses on a theoretical model of technology adoption in two regions
    (N and S), with environmental quality and public effects influencing adoption
    decisions. It does not directly address macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes related
    to climate change adaptation at a national level. The model discusses stationary
    states and their stability based on the interplay of technology efficiency, environmental
    quality, and domestic/foreign public effects, but it lacks specific details that
    can inform the cost/benefit analysis of climate adaptation policies at a national
    level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: The paper studies the dynamics of mitigation and maladaptation, focusing on the
    under-adoption of mitigation strategies and over-adoption of maladaptation strategies
    due to global externalities.
  5: No relevant information
  12: Average level of well-being in two regions (N and S), considering the adoption
    of strategies A (adopting environmental maladaptation technology) and NA (not
    adopting it).
  14: Well-being of agents in developed and less developed regions, environmental
    quality in each region.
  20: Level of well-being; Adoption of environmental adaptation technology (over-
    or under-adopted relative to Pareto-optimum).
