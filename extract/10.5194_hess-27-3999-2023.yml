Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in root zone soil moisture, specifically permanent dry departures (lower
    soil moisture) and permanent wet departures (higher soil moisture) from pre-industrial
    climate variability due to climate change.
  3: Changes in total soil moisture content due to different Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSPs) projecting different greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use
    changes.
  7: Changes in soil moisture (both increases and decreases).
  10: Changes in soil moisture (drying or wetting) driven by changes in precipitation,
    runoff, and evaporation; enhanced evaporative demand.
  13: Effective climate sensitivity (ECS) in climate models impacts the extent of
    soil moisture departures; Emission trajectories affect the extent of permanent
    departures beyond 2100.
  14: Dry and wet soil moisture departures driven by climate change impacting land
    characteristics.
  16: Anthropogenic warming and land system change captured in the SSP scenarios are
    crucial drivers of transgression of the planetary boundary of green water, leading
    to permanent changes in soil moisture.
Highlights:
  1: Without climate policy, rootzone soil moisture in over 25% of global land (ice-free)
    may be permanently beyond pre-industrial variability as early as 2050. Mitigation
    is underscored as important to avoid further degrading the Earth system functions
    upheld by soil moisture.
  3: Projects permanent deviations in soil moisture content from baseline under various
    SSPs.
  7: Global land area is experiencing increasing wet and dry departures from 2021
    to 2100. Different regions are projected to experience either a wet departure
    (increased soil moisture) or a dry departure (decreased soil moisture) depending
    on the climate scenario. The extent and distribution of these departures vary
    across SSP scenarios.
  10: Some regions tend to become drier (MED, CNA, SSA, SWS, SAM, WSAF, and SAU) or
    wetter (SES, NEAF, SAS, WSB, and SAH) regardless of season. High-latitude regions
    tend to become drier in summer and wetter in winter. Drying of surface soil moisture
    can occur even with increased precipitation due to greater evaporative demand.
  13: High ECS values in some models could mean more widespread and pronounced departures
    of soil moisture; wet departures in very dry regions indicate soil moisture is
    expected to be permanently higher, but absolute changes may be low.
  14: Significant drying in the Mediterranean, southern Africa, southern North America,
    and South America, with considerable wet departures detected in northern Africa,
    south-eastern South America, and South Asia.
  16: Even with global mitigation efforts (SSP1-2.6), significant soil moisture changes
    are expected, requiring adaptation. Higher emission scenarios (e.g., SSP3-7.0)
    lead to more widespread and serious transgressions, highlighting the importance
    of mitigation.
Methodology:
  1: "Analysis of root zone soil moisture departures from the pre-industrial climate\
    \ variability for a multi-model ensemble of 14 Earth system models (ESMs) in the\
    \ Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) in four climate scenarios\
    \ (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) between 2021 and 2100. The analyses\
    \ were done for 43 ice-free climate reference regions used by the Intergovernmental\
    \ Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Permanent departures are defined when a region\u2019\
    s soil moisture exits the regional variability envelope of the pre-industrial\
    \ climate and does not fall back into the range covered by the baseline envelope\
    \ until 2100."
  7: Analysis of monthly soil moisture departures represented by 12-month rolling
    means and yearly permanent departures across different Shared Socioeconomic Pathway
    (SSP) scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) compared to a PiControl
    baseline. The analysis looks at exceeding the 5th and 95th percentiles of soil
    moisture content, and is applicable for the period 2021-2100.
  10: Climate models (e.g., ACCES-SCM2, CESM2, CNRM-CM6-1) are used to project changes
    in root zone soil moisture under the SSP1-2.6 scenario. The analysis focuses on
    the frequency and magnitude of departures from the PiControl baseline variability.
  13: Analysis based on relative change in soil moisture and uses IPCC climate reference
    regions for aggregation; permanence defined as departure without reversal until
    2100; uses ensemble medians for analysis of land areas with permanent departures.
  14: "Analysis of soil moisture changes using four IPCC scenarios (SSP1\u20132.6,\
    \ SSP2\u20134.5, SSP3\u20137.0, SSP5\u20138.5) from 14 ESMs in CMIP6, evaluating\
    \ deviations from pre-industrial baselines."
More Notes:
  1: Permanent dry departures are projected to be most pronounced in Central America,
    southern Africa, the Mediterranean region, and most of South America. Permanent
    wet departures are most pronounced in south-eastern South America, northern Africa,
    and southern Asia.
  3: Focuses on total soil moisture rather than root zone soil moisture due to data
    availability. Uses IPCC WGI climate reference regions for analysis. Excludes Greenland
    and Antarctica from time of emergence analysis.
  7: The regions experiencing wet or dry departures are geographically diverse (NES,
    SEA, WAF, TIB etc.)
  10: The quantitative analysis of precipitation, runoff, and evaporation was considered
    beyond the scope of this paper.
  13: Interpretation of results can differ when using ensemble means vs. medians;
    spatial aggregation may lead to overestimation or underestimation; results sensitive
    to temporal variability and distribution of precipitation and temperature, as
    well as availability of irrigation options.

Quantitative material:

    land areas in SSP1-2.6 and in 25% in SSP3-7.0 in 2050. By the end of the 21st
    century, the occurrence of permanent departures in SSP1-2.6 increases to 34% and,
    in SSP3-7.0, to 45%.

    \ climate models (SSP1\u20132.6 scenario)."
  13: Presents percentage of land area with wet or dry departures under different
    SSP scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0); also shows percentage of land area with
    permanent wet or dry departures under the same scenarios; ECS values are mentioned
    (1.8 to 5.6K for CMIP6), but not directly tied to macroeconomic outcomes.
  16: 18% of land surface area with permanent dry departures in SSP1-2.6, 17% in SSP2-4.5,
    17.6% in SSP3-7.0, and 26% in SSP5-8.5. 33% of ice-free land surface area anticipated
    to permanently depart from pre-industrial variability by the end of the 21st century
    even in the SSP1-2.6 trajectory. In about 10% of land areas, permanent departures
    can be expected already by 2050. In SSP3-7.0, 25% land area with permanent departure.
