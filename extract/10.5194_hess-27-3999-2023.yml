Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in root zone soil moisture beyond pre-industrial variability due to global
    warming scenarios specified by SSPs are identified as drivers.
  2: Changes in root zone soil moisture due to climate change, specifically drying
    or wetting trends
  3: Different SSPs, representing various greenhouse gas emissions and land use change
    scenarios, impact soil moisture content.
  4: Root zone soil moisture departures (wet and dry).
  5: Changes in root zone soil moisture content
  7: Changes in soil moisture content, driven by different climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6,
    SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5).
  8: Changes in root zone soil moisture, specifically the emergence of permanent wet
    or dry departures under different SSP scenarios.
  9: Changes in rootzone soil moisture (both wet and dry departures) driven by different
    SSP scenarios
  10: Regions show differing soil moisture reactions depending on the season, with
    drying in summer and wetting in winter for high-latitude regions.
  12: Different SSP scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5).
  13: The analysis highlights that soil moisture trends, which can impact agriculture,
    depend on changes in climate, hydrological variables, and human activities like
    irrigation and drainage.
  14: Changes in total soil moisture, specifically deviations from pre-industrial
    baseline (1850-like conditions).
  15: Changes in seasonal mean total soil moisture content and temperature extremes
    are impacting outcomes in different regions under various SSP scenarios.
  16: Anthropogenic warming and land system change captured in SSP scenarios. Specific
    regional drivers include drying in the Amazon and wetting in the Indian and West
    African monsoon regions under high-emission scenarios.

    scenarios, with a focus on wet or dry departures over time.
  14: No relevant information
  16: The paper evaluates the transgression of the planetary boundary of green water,
    focusing on root zone soil moisture departures (both wet and dry).
Highlights:
  1: The study highlights the regions most affected by soil moisture changes, such
    as Central America and the Mediterranean region for dry departures and northern
    Africa for wet departures, underscoring the importance of mitigation to protect
    Earth system functions.
  2: Aims to determine the future climatic state of root zone soil moisture and quantify
    the global land area with soil moisture content departures to provide scenarios
    for the future status of the green water planetary boundary.
  3: Permanent departures in soil moisture content are identified using the time of
    emergence when values exceed certain percentiles without returning to baseline
    variability.
  4: The analysis examines future deviations from the pre-industrial baseline by comparing
    PiControl data with SSP scenarios, focusing on total soil moisture content.
  5: Mediterranean region (MED) expected to experience significant drying, with a
    high percentage of models projecting permanent dry departures, especially under
    higher SSPs. Some regions in North and South America also face increased drying.
    Parts of Africa (SAH, WAF, NEAF, CAF) and Asia (SAS, WSB, ECA) are projected to
    become wetter. NEAF is expected to have the strongest signal for permanent wet
    departure.
  7: Global land area with wet or dry departures increases from 2021 to 2100. The
    area already experiencing wet or dry departures in 2021 is higher than the expected
    percentage based on a random distribution (5% for both wet and dry).
  8: "A larger land area is predicted to have permanent wet departures than permanent\
    \ dry departures, based on the permanent departure analysis. Results indicate\
    \ that at least 15% of the ice-free land is expected to have permanently more\
    \ soil moisture than the pre-industrial condition by the end of the 21st century\
    \ under the SSP1-2.6 scenario and that this could amount to 28% in SSP3-7.0. Dry\
    \ departures show an opposite trend with 18% of the ice-free land having permanently\
    \ less soil moisture in SSP1\u20132.6 and 17.6% in SSP3\u20137.0."
  9: Areas are projected to experience permanent dry or wet soil moisture departures,
    with the number of months depending on the SSP scenario.
  10: Some regions have consistent drying or wetting regardless of season; soil moisture
    changes are linked to precipitation changes though increased evaporation demand
    also plays a role.
  11: Model spread is not seen as detrimental; it reflects potential futures and is
    part of model robustness.
  12: ESMs have uncertainties in regions like the Sahel and Amazon. Model spread is
    large, particularly in higher northern latitudes.
  13: High ECS values in some models could lead to more pronounced soil moisture departures;
    wetting trends are observed in both moist agricultural areas and dry regions such
    as the Sahara, with differing implications.
  14: Remarkable drying in the Mediterranean, southern Africa, southern North America,
    and South America (except the region of south-eastern South America).
  15: Significant probability increase of warmer temperatures and changes in soil
    moisture content across regions are highlighted by contrasting SSP scenarios.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis is based on a multi-model ensemble of 14 Earth system models in
    the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 under different shared socioeconomic
    pathways between 2021 and 2100.
  2: "Uses a CMIP6 multi-model ensemble of total soil moisture with the Pre-industrial\
    \ Control (Pi-Control) scenario as a baseline and four different future scenarios\
    \ of shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) combined with emission scenarios: SSP1\u2013\
    2.6, SSP2\u20134.5, SSP3\u20137.0, and SSP5\u20138.5. Aggregates data to the scale\
    \ of the IPCC Working Group I (WGI) climate reference regions. Determines the\
    \ \"time of emergence\" when soil moisture moves beyond and does not fall back\
    \ within the envelope of baseline variability before 2100."
  3: Regional deviations from the PiControl baseline are calculated using 30-year
    averages from each SSP.
  4: The paper uses total soil moisture and a pre-industrial baseline. It groups soil
    moisture data by month, determines the time of emergence for each month, and calculates
    the number of months with a permanent departure for each climate region. It then
    calculates the ensemble mean and median percentage of land area with wet or dry
    departures. A 12-month rolling mean is calculated to show the trend from 2021
    to 2100. The analysis is done for both monthly and yearly total soil moisture
    content.
  5: Analysis of ESM projections under different SSPs to determine changes in root
    zone soil moisture. Time of emergence analysis to determine when departures from
    pre-industrial variability become permanent.
  7: Analysis uses monthly soil moisture departures, represented by a 12-month rolling
    mean. Permanent departures are assessed relative to a PiControl baseline, with
    the time of emergence of change varying regionally. Projections are performed
    for the period 2021-2100.
  8: The analysis examines the time of emergence of wet and dry root zone soil moisture
    departures across different ESMs and SSP scenarios.  Permanent departures are
    identified based on when soil moisture consistently deviates from pre-industrial
    conditions.
  9: "Ensemble means are calculated from the number of months with departures in each\
    \ model (shown in Tables S6\u2013S13). Dry departures are shown in red shading,\
    \ wet departures in blue shading."
  11: Results take into account methodological choices and assumptions, including
    model independence and not weighing models based on performance.
  12: Analysis based on ESM (Earth System Model) simulations under different SSP scenarios
    from 2020 to 2100. Applicable for understanding potential future soil moisture
    changes.
  13: The analysis aggregates data using IPCC climate reference regions and investigates
    soil moisture trends and permanence of departures using ensemble medians.
  14: "Analysis of future (2021\u20132100) changes in total soil moisture in different\
    \ IPCC reference regions with respect to the pre-industrial baseline (1850-like\
    \ conditions) using four different scenarios (SSP1\u20132.6, SSP2\u20134.5, SSP3\u2013\
    7.0, and SSP5\u20138.5) from 14 ESMs in CMIP6."
  15: The analysis compares soil moisture and temperature anomalies under different
    SSP scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, etc.) against a pre-industrial control baseline
    for the year 2100.
  16: The analysis uses CMIP6 ESM data. The code for data processing and visualization
    is available online.
More Notes:
  4: The PiControl total soil moisture content of each ensemble member appears to
    vary greatly from the other up to a difference of a factor of 10, but the global
    distribution of soil moisture content seems to be quite similar.
  5: "Inconsistency in departure patterns observed in direct neighboring regions in\
    \ Asia. The strongest signal for permanent dry departure is expected in MED, with\
    \ a median expected time of emergence ranging from 2045 to 2075 for the different\
    \ SSPs. The general trends in Asia from SSP1\u20132.6 to SSP5\u20138.5 are not\
    \ as consistent as in the other continents."
  7: The study presents spatially explicit projections of soil moisture changes under
    different SSP scenarios, highlighting regional variations in the direction (wet
    or dry) and magnitude of change. Figures S11-S18 contain monthly departures in
    each SSP scenario, while Tables S2-S5 show the exact regional time of emergence
    in each model.
  8: The analysis focuses on root zone soil moisture, which is influenced by vegetation
    and less sensitive to evaporation than surface soil moisture. A figure (Fig. 6)
    depicts the distribution of the time of emergence for climate regions where more
    than 50% of ESMs show a permanent wet or dry departure.  Another figure (Fig.
    10) shows changes in the land area with monthly and permanent wet/dry departures.
  9: "Figure 12 compares seasonal mean land area with permanent wet and dry departures\
    \ in boreal summer (JJA) and boreal winter (DJF) for SSP1\u20132.6 and SSP3\u2013\
    7.0. In SSP3-7.0, summer wet and dry departures are similar but in winter wet\
    \ departures are much larger. There is overall drying of soil moisture."
  12: "Land cover change in ESMs is often prescribed, potentially affecting root zone\
    \ soil moisture dynamics. ESMs respond differently to increased atmospheric carbon\
    \ dioxide. Regions with conflicting signals exist around 60, 40, 20\u25E6N, 0\u25E6\
    , 20\u25E6N, and 40\u25E6S."
  14: Agreement between ESMs is higher in regions with strong departure signals. The
    magnitude of drying and wetting increases with the effect of global warming in
    most regions.
  16: The concepts of permanence and time of emergence could be used in future research
    to understand temporal dimensions of Earth resilience and the recoverability of
    planetary boundary transgressions.
