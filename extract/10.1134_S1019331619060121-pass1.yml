  3: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Permafrost thawing and degradation caused by global climate change, particularly
    in the Russian Arctic.
  2: Permafrost thawing and degradation.
  3: Permafrost degradation is implied as a risk factor given the context of the paper.
  4: Permafrost thawing and degradation reducing bearing capacity of soils.
  6: Permafrost thawing and degradation in northern Russian regions due to climate
    warming impacting road infrastructure.
  7: Permafrost thawing and degradation, leading to reduction of soil bearing capacity
    and surface deformation due to thaw subsidence.
  8: Thawing and degradation of permafrost due to climate change.
  9: Permafrost degradation risks, longer terms thawing, degradation, and near-surface
    disappearance of permafrost.
Highlights:
  1: Under the modernization scenario, existing standards and technologies need revision
    to develop innovative construction standards and technologies.
  2: Permafrost degradation causes significant economic damage in Russia, particularly
    to infrastructure and the energy sector.
  3: The extractive industry dominates the economies of the regions, accounting for
    44% of the gross regional product. Motor transport serves 69% of regional freight
    traffic (excluding pipelines).
  4: The paper aims to assess the economic risks of permafrost thaw for road infrastructure
    sustainability in Russia. The cost of fixed assets at risk, length of roads at
    risk, and the cost of reconstruction/repair are key indicators.
  6: Permafrost degradation poses a significant risk to road infrastructure, with
    high projected costs of damage from climate warming.
  7: "Permafrost degradation necessitates significant capital investment for road\
    \ repair and maintenance, especially in regions like Yakutia and Yamalo-Nenets\
    \ AO. Reconstruction of part of the road network with improved quality in 2020\u2013\
    2030 and the subsequent maintenance and upkeep of this infrastructure in 2030\u2013\
    2050 are estimated at \u20BD 272.9 bln."
  8: Risks of disturbing and destroying road infrastructure sustainability are very
    high even under the conservative scenario. Additional costs to repair and maintain
    infrastructure will amount to 0.14% of the total GRP cost of the nine regions
    in 2018. The highest indicators will be typical of Yakutia, Krasnoyarsk krai,
    Magadan oblast, and Chukotka.
  9: Maintaining road infrastructure sustainability in vulnerable regions like Chukotka
    AO, Yakutia, and Magadan oblast will double in cost due to permafrost degradation
    under a modernization scenario.
Methodology:
  1: Three model scenarios considering changes in road infrastructure sustainability
    based on climate change projections and Russia's Transport Strategy until 2035.
  4: The paper uses a statistical approach, relying on data from the Russian Statistics
    Agency (Rosstat) and Russian Mintrans data, combined with some assumptions (e.g.,
    40% depreciation of fixed assets). The cost of fixed assets of motor roads is
    calculated based on the total cost of fixed assets in a region, the share of public
    fixed assets, the share of the fixed assets of the transport industry, and isolating
    the road infrastructure. The methodology is applicable to 2017 Russian data and
    possibly adaptable to other regions with relevant statistical data.
  6: Six global climate change models are used to predict surface-air temperature
    changes; the analysis uses scenario RCP8.5 and applies a formula-based approach
    to calculate soil subsidence and risk assessment.
  7: The analysis uses scenarios (conservative and moderate) to estimate the impact
    of permafrost degradation on road infrastructure sustainability. It calculates
    risk (expected damage) reduction costs for 2020-2050.
  8: The paper proposes a methodology for assessing the effects of permafrost thawing
    and degradation under climate change on the sustainability of the road infrastructure
    in the Russian Arctic.
  9: "Scenario modeling, analysis of economic dynamics correlated with regional economies,\
    \ long-term (until 2030\u20132035) and extended (until 2050) economic growth forecasts."
More Notes:
  2: 'The study focuses on economic assessment of permafrost thawing and degradation
    in nine regions of Russia: the Komi Republic; Yakutia; the Nenets, Yamalo-Nenets,
    Khanty-Mansi, and Chukotka AOs; Krasnoyarsk krai; Magadan oblast; and Kamchatka
    krai.'
  3: The paper discusses the importance of road infrastructure in the Russian North,
    where permafrost degradation could impact the transportation system. The paper
    provides cost estimates for road construction, reconstruction, capital repairs
    and maintenance.
  4: The study excludes roads of category I and does not assess road maintenance directly,
    as maintenance is deemed insufficient in permafrost degradation conditions.
  6: The analysis is based on data from the Russian Federal State Statistics Service
    (Rosstat) and focuses on regional impacts in northern Russia.
  7: The paper notes that the current cost of fixed assets of the road infrastructure
    may be largely conventional, considering the depreciation life of most fixed assets
    expired long ago.
  8: The analysis focuses on the direct damage to road infrastructure, not including
    indirect losses.
  9: The analysis is specific to the Russian Arctic and focuses on road infrastructure.
    The 'modernization scenario' includes infrastructure upgrades.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic costs related to the maintenance and reduction of damage risks to road
    infrastructure due to permafrost thawing and degradation.
  2: "Average annual perennial damage caused by permafrost degradation is about \u20BD\
    150 bln (0.16% of GDP)."
  3: Contribution of the transportation system to the total gross regional product
    is about 7%.
