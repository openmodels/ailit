Highlights:
  1: SLR zones have developed faster and have higher structure density than non-coastal
    areas, particularly in hurricane-affected locations.
  2: The paper provides a fine-scale nationwide analysis of the exposure of the coastal
    built environment to hazards over the twentieth century.
  4: ZTRAX database provides unique opportunities for historical analysis of residential
    land use, housing markets and the built structure; the database is a rich source
    of geospatial data in the form of approximate address point locations and address
    information enabling the characterization of settlement activity at fine spatial
    and temporal resolution.
  6: Hurricanes are seen as an early indicator of future sea level rise conditions.
  7: Coastal zones experienced high expansion and densification rates, with SLR zones
    having higher structure density and development.
  9: Flood zones consistently show the highest levels across all four metrics (density,
    densification, percent developed, and expansion), indicating significant growth
    and development over the period observed (1900-2010).
  11: Coastlines are more developed than inland areas. Southeast has high expansion
    of development later in the 20th century. Western Gulf coast developed rapidly
    after 1950 but remains less developed than the Northeast, Pacific and Southeast.
  12: Relative exposure to sea level rise and hurricanes decreased or remained constant
    across most divisions, except for the South Atlantic, while absolute exposure
    increased across all divisions. Areas at highest risk of hurricanes, particularly
    in the South Atlantic, exhibit higher exposure and more developed characteristics.
  13: MSAs affected by hurricanes are denser and more developed than those not affected,
    suggesting distinctive building patterns in hurricane-prone environments.
  14: Sea-level rise zones tend to be more built up; storm activity is associated
    with denser, more compact urban landscapes in hurricane-prone environments.
  15: Coastal regions are increasingly converging in density and expansion characteristics,
    leading to similar exposure to coastal hazards regardless of regional hazard likelihood.
    There has been a transition from expansion to densification of coastal development,
    leading to increased exposure via added structures and footage within SLR zones.
    Newer structures built under modern building codes may be more adaptive to coastal
    hazards than older structures.
  16: Current development trends may constrain future adaptation efforts related to
    climate change due to increased density and exposure.
  17: Older structures are indicators of elevated vulnerability due to lack of adaptation
    in building codes and old construction practices. Building age has the potential
    to help identify metropolitan areas along the U.S. coast that are vulnerable to
    natural hazards. Considering age data in fine detail can identify vulnerable neighborhoods
    and grid cells.
  18: Coastal areas continue to grow in size and structures despite high exposure
    to natural hazards; findings stress the need to implement adaptive building codes
    and coastal development policies.

Methodology:
  1: Analysis is performed using historical settlement data to examine building patterns
    in SLR zones across the U.S. since the early 20th century.
  2: "The analysis leverages new multi-temporal data on building patterns, the Historical\
    \ Settlement Data Compilation for the U.S. (HISDAC-US) [22, 23], across all major\
    \ coastal communities in the United States from 1900 to 2015. The research analyzes\
    \ gridded historical settlement data layers derived from Zillow\u2019s ZTRAX database\
    \ [35]. It also uses sea level rise zones defined by NOAA [33, 36]."
  4: "Uses ZTRAX database (Zillow Group, Inc.) to create settlement data products\
    \ (HISDAC-US) for the time period 1810\u20132010. The data is gridded at 250-meter\
    \ spatial resolution and 5-year temporal resolution and then resampled to a 50\
    \ meter spatial resolution to better combine with sea level rise zones."
  5: MSA boundaries are employed to analyze settlement patterns in sea level rise
    zones along the coast.
  6: Defines MSAs as adjacent counties/county equivalents with urban areas (population
    >= 50,000) and adjacent areas with high integration (commuting). Micropolitan
    Statistical Areas are defined similarly but with urban cores of 10,000-50,000.
    Uses contemporary MSA boundaries to assess changes over time. Intersects MSAs
    with hurricane eye landfalls from HURDAT2 database (1900-2015) to identify affected
    MSAs (within 20 km of landfall). Excludes protected areas and wetlands from SLR
    zones. Uses zonal statistics to determine the total number of structures, built
    interior area, and built grid cells within each polygon in five-year increments
    from 1900 to 2015.
  7: The analysis measures shifts in built-up proportions, expansion, and densification
    of grid cells using high-quality settlement layers.
  8: The study uses conceptual illustrations and historical maps to show the progression
    of urban development, focusing on expansion and densification over time in areas
    affected by SLR. Development is quantified by buildings per unit area (BUPR).
  9: Expansion and densification were calculated over 10-year time increments.
  11: Comparing the total number of buildings and the percentage of buildings within
    SLR zones in MSAs to quantify exposure.
  12: The study uses panel regression models with fixed effects to examine the relationship
    between hurricane activity and building patterns in coastal MSAs from 1900 to
    2015. It divides coastal MSAs into areas inside and outside the 6-foot SLR zone
    and analyzes building intensity measures.
  13: Regression analysis using dependent variables like share of built-up land, structure
    density, and total structures, with independent variables such as wind speed and
    total historical hurricane hits across metropolitan statistical area (MSA) zones,
    adjusted by census division fixed effects.
  14: "Panel regression analysis of built environment and cumulative storm hits from\
    \ 1900\u20132015 across MSAs with coastal areas inside 6-foot sea-level rise zones."
  15: The analysis examines development patterns along US coastlines, distinguishing
    between expansion and densification. Applicable for historical analysis and projecting
    future trends.
  17: Uses HISDAC-US data to understand development and age of neighborhoods. Uses
    building age as a metric to identify vulnerable metropolitan areas along the U.S.
    coast. Data is available through open licenses for U.S. government datasets or
    CC0 licenses.
  18: The analysis utilized settlement data to understand the evolution of exposure
    along the coastline, focusing on how and where communities build.

More Notes:
  1: Adaptation policies should focus on existing buildings in developed areas due
    to 'saturation effects' in SLR zones.
  2: The paper aims to explain the conditions that give rise to different urban spatial
    forms, particularly with respect to environmental hazards. The analysis sets the
    stage for further long-term work that contends with the historical forces that
    have shaped our cities.
  4: States are excluded from analysis if they have no records of structures and built
    year (the year when the structure was built) available.
  7: Development varied regionally, with older areas like the Northeast developed
    early and showing high density and developed area throughout the 20th century.
  8: The page focuses on exposure, illustrating how coastal development is expanding
    and densifying in areas susceptible to sea level rise and hurricanes.
  9: The paper uses the built up properties (BUPL) data layer from HISDAC to measure
    urban development. The analysis distinguishes between expansion (aerial growth
    of developed land) and structure density (addition of more or bigger structures
    to already developed areas).
  11: The Western Gulf coast is identified as a potential hotspot for new building
    and land-use transitions in the future.
  12: The paper suggests coastal areas develop first, followed by inland expansion.
    It also finds that hurricane activity tends to be associated with more compact
    and dense building patterns.
  17: Building condition and adaptation also drive built environment vulnerability,
    but are difficult to assess with current datasets. The authors argue for policies
    and incentives that prioritize adaptation in coastal communities and note that
    adaptation strategies rely on capital to create coastal communities adapted to
    sea level rise and hazards.
  18: The paper highlights the critical need for adaptation in saturated and dense
    coastal communities and for considering socio-economic factors in exposure and
    vulnerability assessments.
