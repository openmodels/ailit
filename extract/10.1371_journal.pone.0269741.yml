Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea level rise (SLR), hurricanes, climate change, oceanic thermal expansion,
    melting of ice sheets, coastal urban development
  2: Sea level rise and hurricanes.
  5: Exposure to sea level rise and hurricanes, particularly in coastal MSAs
  11: Sea level rise (SLR) and hurricanes are the primary drivers of risk discussed.
    The paper shows exposure to 6-foot SLR zones.
  13: Sea level rise (SLR) and hurricane activity (total historical hits, wind speed).
  14: Exposure to sea-level rise and cumulative hurricanes impacts urban building
    density and land use.
  15: Development along US coastlines, particularly during the post-WWII economic
    boom; Expansion and densification of coastal settlements; Increasing density in
    SLR zones.
  16: Exposure to sea level rise and hurricanes; Coastal storms and flooding; Natural
    disasters due to SLR; Hurricane impacts
  17: Exposure to sea level rise and hurricanes; age of building infrastructure indicating
    potential vulnerability due to outdated building codes and construction practices.
  18: Exposure to sea level rise and hurricanes, high building density and intensely
    developed built environments in coastal communities, coastal development patterns
    after disasters (building size and density tend to increase).
Highlights:
  1: SLR zones developed faster and continue to have higher structure density than
    non-coastal, urban, and inland areas; Density levels in historically less-developed
    coastal areas are now quickly converging on early settled SLR zones, many of which
    have reached building saturation; Adaptation policies targeting existing buildings
    and developed areas are likely to grow in importance relative to the protection
    of previously undeveloped land.
  2: First fine-scale nationwide analysis of the exposure of the coastal built environment
    to hazards over the twentieth century; coastal hazards play a role in shaping
    differences in coastal urban landscapes.
  5: We find massive growth in the Southeast US despite excluding certain low-data-quality
    areas, indicating robust findings
  11: The Southeast region has high and increasingly developed SLR zones. The Western
    Gulf coastline, despite rapid development after 1950, remains less developed and
    is a potential hotspot for future building and land-use transitions impacting
    exposure.
  13: MSAs affected by hurricanes are denser and more developed than those not affected
    by hurricanes.
  14: Higher rates of building in hurricane-affected areas lead to denser urban landscapes,
    particularly in sea-level rise zones.
  15: Coastal building tends to expand with low-density construction in the early
    phase of development, but has transitioned to densification from roughly 1980
    on; All coastal regions follow this general trend, albeit staggered through time
    with differences in the onset of expansion and densification; The Southeastern
    coastline is almost at 50% built-up proportion in the SLR zone, and the Pacific
    even exceeds the coastal density in New England.
  16: Areas at risk of hurricane impacts are more highly developed than those that
    are not at risk; Areas within the Sunbelt are growing and becoming denser despite
    cumulative hurricane hits and high risk of natural hazards; Post-hurricane development
    is associated with increased built environment exposure to coastal hazards.
  17: Building age is a potential indicator of vulnerability to natural hazards along
    the coast. Fine-resolution data can identify vulnerable neighborhoods within MSAs.
    Investment in adaptation along saturated coastlines is necessary for future exposure
    and risk reduction.
  18: Coastal exposure to hazards has led to staggering losses and damages, with growth
    slowing possibly due to saturation. Protection of undeveloped coastal land and
    adaptation in saturated coastal communities are crucial. Coastal development often
    intensifies after hurricanes, compounding exposure.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of changes in exposure using historical settlement layers from the Historical
    Settlement Data Compilation for the U.S. (HISDAC-US) to examine building patterns
    within and between the SLR zones of the conterminous United States since the early
    twentieth century.
  2: Analysis of built-up property records across coastal regions of the U.S. from
    pre-1900 to 2015; overlaying with sea level rise zones; examining long-term changes
    in density and expansion across areas most likely to be impacted by coastal hazards;
    exploring how hurricane exposure relates to historical development.
  5: The study relies on high-quality grid-level data to assess built environment
    changes in coastal areas, using sea level rise zones to analyze risk; uses NOAA
    Sea Level Rise dataset for state-level boundaries
  11: The analysis quantifies the absolute and relative exposure of MSAs to SLR by
    comparing the total number of buildings (absolute exposure) and the percentage
    of buildings (relative exposure) inside SLR zones. The results are applicable
    for the period 1900-2015, based on the provided figures.
  13: Regression analysis using 3 dependent variables (share of built-up land, structure
    density, total structures) and 2 independent variables (wind speed, total historical
    hits) across 5 units of analysis (MSA zones within and out of the SLR and no,
    low, or high impact from hurricanes). Models include census division fixed effects.
    The dependent variables were measured in 2015. Results are relative to a SLR zone
    with no storms.
  14: "Panel regression analysis from 1900\u20132015, focusing on metropolitan statistical\
    \ areas with sea-level rise zones and hurricane landfalls."
  15: Analysis of coastal settlement trajectories, focusing on expansion (lateral
    growth) and densification (addition of structures to already developed areas).
  17: Uses HISDAC-US data to determine built environment characteristics at fine spatial
    and temporal resolution to assess vulnerability based on location, timing of construction,
    and composition of the built environment.
More Notes:
  2: The study leverages a new multi-temporal dataset (HISDAC-US) on building patterns
    derived from Zillow's ZTRAX database.
  5: Reliability is improved by excluding areas with poor data quality; NOAA's zones
    are preferred over FEMA's due to uniformity across the US
  11: The paper distinguishes between densification- and sprawl-based development
    trajectories in coastal areas. The paper uses open license U.S. government datasets.
    The study investigates how the rate of building in coastal areas has slowed over
    recent decades, and explores how this shift affects exposure to environmental
    change.
  13: The study focuses on the differences in building intensity between SLR zones
    and interior areas within MSAs, controlling for geographical and temporal heterogeneity.
    The consistency of estimates in terms of hurricane events and mean wind speed
    led the authors to focus on cumulative hurricane events.
  15: Convergence patterns imply that the effects of the historical conditions that
    gave rise to distinctive coastal built environments may have been temporary, with
    an anticipation of increasing uniformity in exposure conditions over the years
    to come.
  16: The paper focuses on the physical exposure of the built environment to coastal
    hazards, which is a precursor to macroeconomic and fiscal risks, but does not
    directly quantify the economic impacts. It implies that densification constrains
    future adaptation efforts.
  18: The study uses spatial and temporal resolution of settlement data to understand
    the evolution of exposure along the coast and how communities build, intending
    to inform sustainable development and resilient coastal communities.

    damage estimates.
  5: No relevant information
  11: This paper does not directly address macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes like GDP
    effects, productivity loss, budget balance, etc. It focuses on exposure of built
    environments to sea level rise.
  13: Impact on building intensity (share of built-up land, structure density, total
    structures) in areas exposed to sea level rise and hurricanes.
  15: Increasing exposure to sea level rise and hurricanes due to increased structures
    and square footage within SLR zones; Possible decreasing built environment vulnerability
    due to modern building codes.
  16: Increasing numbers of structures and property at risk in SLR zones increases
    absolute exposure of structures to natural hazards and flooding, which implicitly
    leads to increasing economic costs.
  18: Losses and damages from natural hazards (implicitly impacting GDP and fiscal
    resources).
Quantitative material:
  1: Current estimates of U.S. property at risk are evaluated at over a trillion U.S.
    dollars; more than 2.5 million U.S. coastal properties are at risk.
  2: $1.07 trillion dollars worth of National Wetlands Inventory are at risk of disruptive
    flooding by 2100.
  5: No relevant information
  11: The paper includes quantitative data on the number and percentage of structures
    in SLR zones, both geographically (maps of MSAs) and temporally (line graphs from
    1900-2000 by Census Division).
  13: Coefficient estimates (represented on the y-axis of figures) are used to illustrate
    higher rates of structure density or total structures relative to MSAs not affected
    by hurricanes. Severity levels are also quantified, with 'severe' being defined
    as 5 or more storms since 1900 and 'less severe' as 1-4 storms.
  14: Hurricane activity associated with an increase of 2.3 percentage points in share
    of built-up land per storm unit.
