Drivers of Risk:
  1: Anthropogenic global warming leading to accelerated sea-level rise.
  5: Sea-level rise contributing to factors like storm surge and wetland loss.
  6: Sea-level rise causing coastal flooding and loss of wetlands.
  7: Sea-level rise is causing coastal squeeze and saltmarsh loss in Europe.
  8: Sea-level rise; Rapid population growth; Local subsidence and sediment starvation
    in the Niger delta
  9: Sea-level rise; Subsidence; Human modifications to deltaic sediment budgets;
    Tropical cyclones; Changes in monsoons; Coastal urbanization; Groundwater withdrawals;
    Saltwater intrusion; Soil salinisation.
Highlights:
  1: The paper highlights the regional dimensions of sea-level rise impacts and the
    potential benefits of regional cooperation for mitigation and adaptation.
  5: Rising sea levels could lead to significant flooding impacting up to 120 million
    people annually and substantial adaptation costs.
  6: Protection from sea-level rise in Europe is optimal in harbors and cities with
    high population and economic significance, whereas lower protection is recommended
    for low-density and lower-income areas.
  7: There is growing concern about coastal squeeze due to sea-level rise in Europe.
  8: West Africa is vulnerable to accelerated sea-level rise, but more national or
    regional studies are needed for more precise conclusions. Rapid population growth
    will increase vulnerability to sea-level rise substantially over the next few
    decades.
  9: Bangladesh and Vietnam are particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise, with potentially
    millions of people displaced. Sea-level rise threatens rice production in the
    region, potentially impacting the food supply.
Methodology:
  1: The paper is based on global reviews and analyses of relative vulnerability,
    with a focus on contrasting regions examined in more detail using local and national
    assessments.
  5: Global vulnerability analysis (GVA) performed using global datasets and assumptions,
    calculations performed at national scale, results aggregated to regional and global
    scales.
  6: Local and national assessments are used to investigate regional vulnerabilities,
    focusing on protection costs versus costs of land loss.
  7: Strategic shoreline management planning is being applied in Britain to manage
    coastal retreat.
  8: The analysis is based on assessments of a 1 m rise in sea level for the 1990s'
    socioeconomic situation. The results are applicable to understanding the potential
    impacts under these specific conditions.
  9: The analysis estimates land loss and population displacement based on sea-level
    rise scenarios without adaptation. The time period seems to be the 1990s for the
    base population. Analysis also includes impact on rice production and potential
    people affected.
More Notes:
  1: The paper argues for the importance of a regional perspective in addressing climate
    change, particularly for mitigation and adaptation strategies.
  5: Analysis assumes instantaneous response rather than a progressive adaptation
    approach.
  9: The paper acknowledges the difficulty of implementing coastal hazard planning
    given rapid development and immediate needs of the local population. The study
    is based on the assumption of no adaptation measures.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: The paper suggests impacts on land loss, increased flooding, and salinisation
    due to sea-level rise, which would have socioeconomic consequences.
  5: National protection/adaptation costs and global adaptation costs such as the
    raising of dikes could collectively cost US $1000 billion in 1990 dollars, representing
    5.6% of 1990 global world income.
  7: Managed retreat and coastal squeeze mitigation are being considered in Britain
    to avoid saltmarsh loss.
  8: Capital value loss (millions of US$) and as a percentage of GNP; Adaptation/protection
    costs (millions of US$) and as a percentage of GNP
  9: Land loss and population displacement due to sea-level rise; Potential reduction
    in rice production.
Quantitative material:
  5: Adaptation costs could be 5.6% of 1990 global world income; estimates up to 120
    million people could be flooded annually due to increased flood frequency.
  8: Table 3 provides estimates of land loss (km2 and %); population affected (1000s
    and %); capital value loss (Million US$ and % GNP); and adaptation/protection
    costs (Million US$ and % GNP) for Senegal, Nigeria, and Benin, assuming a 1m sea-level
    rise and the 1990s socioeconomic situation. Specific values given in the table.
  9: 'Table 4 provides quantitative estimates of land loss (km2 and %) and population
    displaced (millions and %) for various SLR scenarios in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia,
    Malaysia, Pakistan, and Vietnam. Example: Bangladesh land loss of 15668 km2 displacing
    5.5 million people with a 45cm SLR. 10% of regional rice production is susceptible
    to a 1 m rise in sea level. Direct land loss combined with less favourable hydraulic
    conditions may reduce rice production yields by 4 % if no adaptation measures
    are taken.'
