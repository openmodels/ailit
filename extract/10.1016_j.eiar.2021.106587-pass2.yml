Evaluation overview:
  1: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) evaluating welfare gains or losses from an investment,
    considering environmental impacts.

  3: No relevant information
  6: No relevant information
  7: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: The time horizon in CBA can significantly impact results, even more than the
    discount rate. Failing to capture long-term welfare gains and losses can bias
    analysis towards carbon-intensive or environmentally damaging projects.
  2: This paper highlights the importance of integrating environmental impacts into
    CBA to avoid underestimation of social benefits and bad economic decisions. It
    also emphasizes the need for 'strong sustainability' guidance from the natural
    sciences in CBA, requiring integration across system levels and a holistic approach
    from sustainability science. The paper also mentions the long lifetime of infrastructure
    and that it is one of the determinants that cause lock-in to carbon-intensive
    brown-growth.
  3: Highlights the importance of considering sustainability, declining discount rates,
    valuing environmental externalities and co-benefits (especially reduced air pollution),
    and addressing equity considerations in CBA. Also highlights the importance of
    the time horizon in CBA and its impact on the inclusion of environmental costs
    and benefits.
  5: The document highlights the need for extended time horizons in CBA to account
    for long-term environmental impacts, specifically referencing emissions and greenhouse
    gas effects.
  6: The impact on discounted net benefits is considerable when changing discount
    rates.
  7: The time horizon used in cost-benefit analysis has a major impact on the accounting
    for benefit flows from public projects and can be more significant than the discount
    rate used.
Methodology:
  1: Reviews technical aspects of setting the time horizon in CBA, emphasizing scenarios
    and sensitivity testing. Recommends timescales of 100+ years for projects with
    long-term environmental effects.
  2: This paper provides a brief review of key developments in Cost-Benefit Analysis
    (CBA), particularly changes in applied practice, and focuses on the time horizon
    of analysis. It reviews the evolution of CBA driven by sustainability science
    and 'the environment'.
  3: Discusses Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and its evolution, including changes in
    discounting, externality valuations, and the inclusion of equity and co-benefits.
    Emphasizes the use of ecosystem services and Total Economic Value (TEV) frameworks
    for identifying and valuing environmental impacts.
  4: Discusses the influence of uncertainty and discounting on the choice of time
    horizon in CBA, suggesting scenario approaches to manage uncertainty.
  5: The analysis discusses the use of different time horizons in cost-benefit analysis
    (CBA) to capture long-term impacts, recommending time horizons up to 125, 300,
    or even infinite years based on international practices.
  6: The analysis uses social discount rates of 3%, 5%, and 7%, as well as 1.4% (from
    Stern, 2007) and 0% to value a constant annual benefit flow of $1000 USD over
    different time horizons (25, 50, 100, and 120 years). The impact of different
    discount rates on the discounted net benefits is then calculated.
  7: Simple theoretical analysis using a constant flow of benefits under different
    constant discount rates is performed to compare different time horizons. Analysis
    involves calculating net benefits over time, and is used to evaluate public policies
    and projects.
More Notes:
  1: Uncertainty is a technical challenge to long-term analysis.
  2: This paper emphasizes that environmental considerations should not be limited
    to the appraisal of 'environmental projects' but should be fundamental to the
    analysis of public investment in general. It is concerned that a 'weak sustainability'
    interpretation of CBA would leave local or global damages to fall outside the
    scope of CBA. The paper also claims that not taking environmental impacts into
    account will result in an over- or underestimation of the social benefits of the
    project and will lead to bad economic decisions
  3: The paper argues that the time horizon used in a CBA significantly affects the
    valuation of environmental projects, potentially undervaluing true costs or benefits
    if too short.
  5: The document reviews international CBA practices, emphasizing the importance
    of declining discount rates and long-term time horizons to better assess long-term
    projects.
  6: The paper discusses the effect of time horizons and discount rates on the valuation
    of long-term benefits. The EU guidance often uses shorter time horizons (10-30
    years), defined financially rather than by technical lifetime or impacts on welfare.
    OECD countries use a variety of time horizons in transport CBA, energy investments,
    and policy assessments.
  7: Longer time horizons are increasingly being adopted in cost-benefit analysis
    for environmental impacts to better capture long-term externalities and sustainability
    considerations, sometimes through lengthening the analysis period or using residual
    calculations.
  8: The paper discusses cost-benefit analysis (CBA) as a tool for project appraisal
    and policy analysis, emphasizing the need for enhancement and improvement to address
    environmental challenges and incorporate long-term time horizons.

  3: Table 1 illustrates discount rates for selected OECD countries, showing differences
    between short to medium-term and long-term discounting.
  6: Moving from a 7% discount rate to a 3% rate increases net benefits over 25 years
    by $5,723, or 48.84% for a constant annual benefit flow of $1000 USD. Moving to
    a 1.4% discount rate or a zero discount rate increases discounted net benefits
    by 79.07% and 93.92%, respectively, over a 25 year period compared to a 7% discount
    rate, for a constant annual benefit flow of $1000 USD.
  7: A constant 3% discount rate extended from 25 to 50 years has more impact on results
    than moving from 3% to 1.4% or even to a zero discount rate when remaining on
    a shorter 25 year analysis period.
