  7: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, air pollution, ecosystem damages.
  2: Insufficient consideration of environmental impacts and sustainability in economic
    evaluations can lead to a favoring of more carbon-intensive and environmentally
    damaging growth.
  6: Discount rates and time horizons used in cost-benefit analysis.
Highlights:
  1: The time horizon of analysis can have a considerable impact on results, even
    more substantial than the discount rate. Failing to fully capture long-term welfare
    gains and losses will distort analysis with a bias towards projects that are more
    carbon-intensive or environmentally damaging. This undermines welfare and sustainable
    development.
  2: The integration of 'strong sustainability' guidance from the natural sciences
    is necessary for CBA to ensure that sustainability principles are embedded across
    system levels.
  6: Lower discount rates and longer time horizons significantly increase the discounted
    net benefits.
  7: Extending the time horizon of analysis in CBA, even by a limited amount (e.g.,
    from 25 to 50 years with a 3% discount rate), can have a more significant impact
    on results than reducing discount rates (e.g., from 3% to 1.4% or even 0%). Longer
    time horizons are needed for the economic analysis of environmental benefits and
    avoided damages. There is a risk of a 'pessimism bias' for environmentally beneficial
    projects and an 'optimism bias' for environmentally damaging projects when short
    time horizons are used.
Methodology:
  1: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA), scenario analysis, sensitivity testing. Recommends
    using timescales of 100+ years for projects with long-term environmental effects.
  2: The paper reviews evolving practices in cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and emphasizes
    the need to integrate environmental and sustainability science into economic appraisals.
  6: Cost-benefit analysis with varying discount rates and time horizons is used to
    quantify the impact on discounted net benefits. Constant discount rates are applied
    over time.
  7: The paper employs cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and reviews national and international
    practices. It uses theoretical analysis with a constant flow of benefits under
    different constant discount rates to illustrate the impact of time horizon. It
    suggests using longer analysis periods (100+ years) and residual calculations
    to capture long-term externalities.
More Notes:
  1: Environmental CBA has helped shake the conceptual foundations of discounting.
    The economics of climate change has driven the inclusion of the environment in
    analyzing economic welfare. Standard CBA approaches may not be suitable for climate
    change due to its non-marginal nature, long timescales, equity considerations,
    challenges in measuring non-market values, and uncertainty of outcomes.
  2: The paper highlights the importance of considering longer-term time horizons
    in CBA to address systemic changes and potential environmental impacts.
  6: The paper highlights the sensitivity of cost-benefit analysis results to the
    choice of discount rate and time horizon. It mentions that EU guidance often uses
    shorter time horizons defined financially. Hotelling's rule and its strict interpretation
    is given as justification for the zero discount rate.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Welfare gains or losses from investments, environmental costs and benefits.
  2: Economic appraisal and evaluation highlight the importance of embedding environmental
    and social externalities into the assessment of public investment and policy.
  6: Discounted net benefits of a constant annual benefit flow of $1000 USD per annum.
Quantitative material:
  6: Table 2 provides quantitative examples of the effect of different discount rates
    (7%, 5%, 3%, 1.4%, and 0%) and time horizons (25, 50, 100, and 120 years) on the
    present value of a constant annual benefit flow of $1000 USD.
