Drivers of Risk:
  3: Temperature and precipitation anomalies (positive and negative), soil moisture.
  7: Harmful climatic impacts may induce population mobility, agriculture is a possible
    channel through which this happens, drought and high temperature have a synergistically
    negative impact on yields.
Highlights:
  3: Positive anomalies of maximum temperature increase migration flows. Negative
    anomalies in precipitation increase migration flows.
  7: No relevant information
Methodology:
  3: Gravity model estimation using Poisson Pseudo Maximum-Likelihood (PPML) on panel
    data. Specifically, the relationship between climatic variables and internal migration
    is analyzed for South Africa using a gravity model.
  7: "The study can be extended in at least three ways. First, as mentioned, our econometric\
    \ speci\uFB01cations do not take into account spatial autocorrelation possibly\
    \ existing in climatic data and migration \uFB02ows."
More Notes:
  3: The analysis controls for distance, contiguity, population, primary school completion
    rate, white population share, unemployment rate, origin and time-destination fixed
    effects, demographic and socio-economic origin controls, and bilateral covariates.
  7: The study focuses on South Africa and mentions the importance of the agricultural
    sector to the economy despite only 11% of land being suitable for cultivation.
No relevant information:
  2: This page focuses on internal migration flows in South Africa as a response to
    climate variability, not on macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes or adaptation
    costs and benefits.
  5: This page focuses on climate-related migration and does not directly address
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, costs/benefits of adaptation, or related
    economic measures at a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Inter-district migration flow of adults (15-64 years old).

Quantitative material:
  3: Yes, the table contains coefficients, significance levels, N, Model DF, Pseudo
    R2, and Wald Chi2.
