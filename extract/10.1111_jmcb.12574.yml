    changes, however this is not explicitly stated.
Highlights:
  1: "Seasonal temperatures have significant effects on the U.S. economy, particularly\
    \ summer temperatures. A 1\xB0F increase in average summer temperature reduces\
    \ state-level output growth by 0.15 to 0.25 percentage points."
  2: Rising summer temperatures negatively affect U.S. economic activities at both
    the aggregate and industry levels. Summer temperatures have a negative effect,
    while fall temperatures have a positive effect on economic growth. The summer
    effect dominates the fall effect in the post-1990 sample.
  3: Summer temperature increases decrease the annual growth rate of labor productivity;
    effect of summer temperature on GDP varies across industries; some industries
    (utilities) benefit from increased summer temperatures, while others (finance,
    real estate, insurance, agriculture, wholesale, construction, retail, communication,
    government, transportation, manufacturing, mining) are negatively affected.
  4: The analysis finds a potential reduction of the U.S. growth rate due to temperature
    increases, affecting policy recommendations for greenhouse gas regulation.
  5: The paper assesses the cumulative effect of adverse winter weather conditions
    on the annual growth rate of output and emphasizes the effect of summer temperatures.
  7: Increase in summer temperature negatively affects GSP growth; Increase in fall
    temperature positively affects GSP growth; Temperature fluctuations may affect
    the volatility of GDP growth.
  8: The estimated coefficients for the effect of temperature on economic growth are
    generally not statistically significant in the time series analysis. Some coefficients
    in the panel analysis are significant at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, as indicated
    by *, **, and ***.
  11: Lagged temperatures are generally statistically significant, except for the
    winter season. The signs of the effects for summer and fall do not change when
    considering the lagged temperatures.
  12: Summer temperatures have a lasting negative effect on output growth, whereas
    the fall effects are not robust.
  13: The paper investigates the stability across time of the effect of average seasonal
    temperatures on GSP growth. It also studies the possibility that temperature affects
    economic growth through labor productivity, defined as the ratio between total
    private industry output and employment.
  14: Summer temperatures negatively affect productivity growth, while fall temperatures
    also have a detrimental impact on productivity growth. These effects appear to
    be a main mechanism through which summer and fall temperatures affect GSP growth.
  15: Global warming effects may not be limited to agriculture-related sectors, and
    high temperatures negatively affect worker productivity and increase health-related
    costs, impacting sectors such as retail, wholesale, construction, and insurance.
  16: Rising summer temperatures may negatively impact household demand in the retail
    sector and the real estate sector.
  17: Certain sectors, like Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, experience significant
    negative impacts on GDP, both pre and post-1997.
  18: Significant negative impacts on output growth for various industries due to
    temperature changes, such as professional and business services, other services,
    and food services.
  19: Summer temperature has a negative effect on retail, wholesale, real estate,
    and insurance sectors, with the impact being more pronounced in the post-1997
    period; The most sensitive sectors to a temperature increase in the post-1997
    sample are real estate, retail and wholesale trade, and insurance.
  20: Rising summer temperatures negatively affect agriculture, forestry, and fishing;
    utilities and mining sectors benefit from warmer summers due to higher energy
    consumption; Summer and Fall temperatures impact Southern states most; Effects
    of summer temperatures affect a large cross-section of industries, accounting
    for more than a third of national GDP.
  21: Seasonal temperatures have different effects on GSP growth in different regions
    of the US. For example, summer temperatures have a positive significant effect
    on GSP growth in the South.
  22: Agricultural sector showed the smallest percentage increase in effect of temperature;
    the larger contribution of the South to economic activity post-1997 is notable.
  23: Less developed states in the South are driving the strong negative effect of
    summer temperature on GSP growth.
  24: Summer temperature has a negative and significant effect on GSP growth in both
    the South and the entire U.S. The negative effect of summer temperature is not
    driven by less developed states.
  25: Significance of temperature effects on sectors other than agriculture; projection
    assumes no adaptation or mitigation and that impacts remain constant.
  26: Rising temperatures could reduce economic growth by roughly a third of the historical
    average nominal U.S. GDP growth rate under the high emission scenario.
  27: Summer consistently shows a statistically significant negative impact on GSP
    across various robustness checks. Fall often shows a statistically significant
    positive impact on GSP across various robustness checks, though not as consistently
    as Summer.
  28: The negative relationship between average summer temperature and GSP growth
    is very robust. The positive relationship between average fall temperature and
    growth is not supported in several robustness checks.
  29: An increase in average summer temperature has a strong negative effect on economic
    growth rates; the economic effect of summer temperatures is mainly driven by the
    months of July and August; the fall effect is not significant under any of the
    alternative seasonal definitions.
  30: An increase in average summer temperature has a significant and robust negative
    effect on GSP growth. There is a positive, albeit weaker and less robust, effect
    of an increase in the average fall temperature. The summer effect dominates.
  33: Summer temperature changes have a statistically significant (p<0.05) effect
    on GSP growth.
  34: GDP growth rates for most US states are strongly autocorrelated. Seasonal temperatures
    exhibit correlations with other seasons. A panel analysis shows the impact of
    seasonal temperature on some outcome, and reports that Summer's temperature has
    a significant negative impact, while Fall's temperature has a significant positive
    impact.
  36: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector shows the largest negative impact
    in terms of the coefficient on GDP share, both pre- and post-1997.
  38: No relevant information
  39: Table A15 shows that summer temperature has a negative effect on productivity
    and fall temperature has a positive impact on productivity. Table A15 also indicates
    that there is a relationship between Spring temperature and employment.
  40: Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing sector shows the largest negative impact
    from temperature changes in both pre- and post-1997 periods. Utilities and Mining
    sectors show positive impacts from temperature change in the post-1997 period.
    Finance, Insurance, Real Estate shows a larger negative impact post-1997.
  41: Negative impact on GDP share for several sectors like insurance, accommodation,
    and food services due to temperature changes.
  42: Table A19 shows that contemporaneous temperature has a negative impact on productivity,
    especially in the summer, and contemporaneous temperature also reduces employment
    in the spring. Lagged temperatures have a significant impact on contemporaneous
    employment.
  43: Significant negative coefficients observed in agriculture, forestry, fishing
    due to temperature impacts.
  44: Temperature, both contemporary and lagged, negatively impacts Gross State Product
    and several sectors like Services, Retail and Wholesale.
  45: Contemporary and lagged temperature have statistically significant negative
    impacts on growth in several service and finance/real estate sectors.
  46: The table presents coefficients for the relationship between seasonal temperatures
    and an unspecified outcome, with statistical significance indicated by asterisks
    (*, **, ***). The Sum of Coefficients and Wald test p-values, help indicate aggregate
    impact and significance of temperature.
  47: Mining shows the largest decrease in the upper chart. Insurance carriers, Professional
    and business services, and Federal Reserve banks show prominent positive changes
    in the lower chart.
  48: The analysis indicates that summer temperatures have varying impacts on GDP
    growth across industries.
  49: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing show the largest negative impact pre and
    post 1997. Finance, insurance, and real estate show significant negative impacts
    post 1997. The results document that, despite some marginal loss of power, the
    estimated summer coefficients appear very much in line with those in the benchmark
    specification.
  50: The boxplots show how the distribution of regression results changes with the
    inclusion of different seasons. Cases 1-4 are different models related to industry
    regressions.

    \ using ArcGIS and TIGER shapefiles from 2013. They weight daily temperature,\
    \ precipitation, and snowfall within a 500-km radius of each county's centroid\
    \ by the inverse of the straight-line distance. State-level aggregation uses county\
    \ area or population weights. They use nominal GSP between 1957 and 2012 for all\
    \ 50 states and the District of Columbia as a measure of value added in production.\
    \ They use industry output data categorized using SIC codes (1963\u20131997) and\

    both dimensions, Wald tests are performed to assess significance of the sum of
    contemporaneous and lagged coefficients.
  12: Analysis is conducted using a panel regression approach examining temperature
    effects over time with robustness checks for lagged temperatures.

    on temperatures, using data from 50 US states and the District of Columbia from
    1990-2011. Regressions include lagged dependent variable, state, and year fixed

    based on U.S. Census Bureau classification.
  21: Panel regressions of state GSP growth rate on temperatures, using the cross-section
    of U.S. states in each region. Includes lagged dependent variable, and state and
    year fixed effects. States are weighted by the proportion of their GSP relative
    to the region's GDP. Sample is 1957-2012. Standard errors are clustered by year,
    by state, and by both dimensions.
  22: State and year fixed effects panel regressions, with states weighted by relative
    GSP.
  23: Uses regression analysis to investigate the relationship between development
    level of a state, seasonal temperatures, and GSP growth; employs Human Development
    Index (HDI) to classify states as having 'low development'; regression equation
    (11) includes temperature variables, HDI interaction term, lagged GSP growth,
    and fixed effects.
  24: "The analysis uses a regression model (equation 11) with state and year fixed\
    \ effects, controlling for lagged GSP growth. Data spans from 1957\u20132012.\
    \ Standard errors are clustered by year and by state."

    projections from 16 GCMs under three IPCC scenarios (A2, A1B, B1) to estimate
    long-term impacts on GDP growth.
  26: "The reduction in GDP growth is calculated based on the expected change in average\
    \ temperature of a season and the impact coefficient of that season; they use\
    \ \u03B2\u02C6summer = -0.154 and \u03B2\u02C6fall = 0.102."
  27: The analysis involves panel regressions with various robustness checks, including
    alternative panel weights (time-varying GSP, state population, state area), alternative
    GSP measures (per-capita GSP, real GSP, private industries only), and alternative
    temperature data (Temp. weighted by pop., Pre-1950 deseasonalization).
  28: Panel regression analysis using state-level data from 1957-2012 (with some variations).
    Robustness checks are performed by controlling for precipitation and temperature
    volatility, excluding AR(1) terms, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, using alternative
    panel weights (population, area, time-varying GSP), using core seasonal months,
    and adjusting for spatial correlation. Standard errors are clustered by year,

    \ seasons and temperature data aggregation methods; deseasonalization methods,\
    \ and sources of temperature data; robustness checks to additional variations\
    \ of their main specification, spatial correlation."
  30: The analysis uses state-level panel regressions with controls for precipitation
    and temperature volatility. Spatial correlation is addressed using a correction
    proposed by Conley (1999) and adapted by Hsiang (2010) with a radius of 300 km.
    The analysis also excludes lagged GSP and noncontiguous states (Alaska and Hawaii)
    as robustness checks.

    4, specifically including a one-year lag of temperature.
  46: Regression analysis examining the impact of temperature on an unspecified macroeconomic
    or fiscal variable. Robustness is assessed and shown in this table. The analysis
    is performed for four different regions within a country (North, South, Midwest,

    errors are clustered by year and by state. The statistical significance of the
    coefficients are indicated by the p-values associated with the Wald test.
  47: Panel analysis using Arellano-Bond is applied in Table A24. Regression analysis
    is used for the industry analysis in Table 4, with results visualized in Figure
    A1.
  48: Uses Arellano-Bond estimation for robustness checking; includes lagged dependent
    variables.
  49: Arellano-Bond estimation is used. Robustness checks include adding fall or pooled
    spring/winter seasons. The paper focuses on summer coefficients, providing results
    for two subsamples that coincide with the adoption of NAICS codes. Models are
    controlled to use industry state-level data, with coefficient estimates and standard
    errors in parentheses.
  50: The analysis uses industry regressions with different seasonal inclusions (Fall,
    Summer, Spring/Winter, All Seasons). Boxplots are used to visualize the distribution
    of the regression results. The time period covered is 1997-2011.
More Notes:
  1: The analysis is focused on the United States.
  2: Temperature effects are particularly strong in states with relatively higher
    summer temperatures, mostly in the South.
  3: The paper documents a pervasive effect of summer temperatures on the cross-section
    of industries in the U.S.
  5: The analysis focuses on the 1957-2012 sample, which coincides with the period
    for which they have data on GSP.
  7: Analysis uses US state-level data; The study considers welfare costs of economic
    fluctuations related to temperature variations; The effect of summer temperature
    on GSP growth is more robust than the effect of fall temperature.
  8: Standard errors are clustered by year, by state, and by both dimensions in the
    panel regressions.
  11: 'Equation (8) specifies the regression model used, including notation: /Delta1yi,t
    = growth rate of GSP for state i in year t;  Ti,s,t = temperature in state i during
    season s in year t; alpha_i = state fixed effects; alpha_t = year fixed effects.'
  12: The effect of temperature on GSP is notably strong in southern states and affects
    various industry groups differently.
  13: The analysis focuses on private industries due to data availability. The time
    period analyzed starts with years from 1960 to 1990 and ends in 2012.
  14: The analysis suggests that the primary pathway through which summer and fall
    temperatures affect GSP growth is through productivity growth, rather than employment
    growth.
  16: Caution against combining pre- and post-1997 data series due to industry classification
    changes.
  19: The paper finds some evidence for a negative impact of summer temperatures on
    the construction sector, but with lesser statistical significance.
  20: The effect on agriculture, forestry, and fishing is intuitive but this sector
    accounts for only about 1% of national GDP; Higher temperatures systematically
    affect a large cross-section of industries. Southern states are particularly sensitive
    to summer and fall temperatures.
  21: "Regions are classified according to the Census Bureau. Winter is January\u2013\
    March, spring is April\u2013June, summer is July\u2013September, fall is October\u2013\
    December."
  23: The paper combines estimated impact coefficients with temperature change projections
    to assess the long-term impact of rising temperature on U.S. economic growth.
  24: The analysis suggests the different industrial composition of more and less
    developed states is a factor, with more developed states having industries more
    exposed to summer weather.
  26: 'The analysis considers three emission scenarios: A2 (High), A1B (Medium), and
    B1 (Low). The reported ranges represent the minimum and maximum projected impacts,
    with quartiles and the median also indicated.'
  28: States are typically weighted by the proportion of their GSP relative to the
    whole country's GDP, averaged over the sample period. Alternative weighting schemes
    are explored, including weighting by population, area, and time-varying GSP. The
    sample period varies slightly in some specifications (e.g., private industries
    only, real GSP).
  29: The study checks the robustness of the findings to various definitions of seasons,
    aggregation methods for temperature data, deseasonalization methods, and different
    sources of temperature data; The study controls for population growth, inflation,
    and the public sector.
  30: The paper includes various robustness checks, including excluding lagged GSP
    and noncontiguous states. The results are generally robust to alternative specifications
    for summer temperatures but less so for fall temperatures.
  32: This page primarily provides industry classifications and explains the construction
    of weather data series used in the broader study. The table shows how industries
    were classified before and after 1997 using SIC and NAICS codes, respectively.
    The text describes the method of compiling temperature data from multiple weather
    stations to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
  33: The table includes information at the US state level. The paper examines the
    correlation between individual weather stations to address spatial dependence
    in temperature data.
  34: 'Significance levels are indicated by asterisks: *** (1%), ** (5%), and * (10%).'

    that table might have important information about the analysis.
  38: No relevant information
  40: The table is a robustness check for Table 4 in the main text. Statistical significance
    is indicated by asterisks, though the number of asterisks is not clearly associated
    to conventional p-values.
  42: The significance levels are indicated by asterisks (*, **, ***) next to the
    standard errors. Wald test p-values are also reported to test the joint significance
    of coefficients.
  44: "\u2020 Indicates Services and Communication/Information sectors have multiple\
    \ sets of values, possibly indicating different specifications or controls. The\
    \ meaning of values such as '0.014\u22120.576' and '0.605\u22120.209' and '1.817\
    \ \u2212 0.274' is unclear."
  45: The note in the bottom says that results are broadly consistent with those reported
    in Table 2.
  46: The dependent variable being analyzed is not described on this page. The note
    at the bottom references Table 5 in the main text, where further information about
    the regression setup, dependent variable and results are likely found.
  49: The table presents coefficients, not actual GDP effects, productivity loss,
    etc. The coefficients represent the impact of an unspecified 'summer' variable,
    presumably temperature, on GSP.
  50: The information on this page is incomplete without further context about the
    variables and the specific industry regressions being performed. Figure 1 is referenced
    as being important for understanding this information.

Quantitative material:
  1: "A 1\xB0F increase in average summer temperature is associated with a reduction\
    \ in the annual growth rate of state-level output of 0.15 to 0.25 percentage points.\
    \ Rising temperatures could reduce U.S. economic growth by up to one-third over\
    \ the next century."
  2: "A 1\xB0F increase in the average summer temperature is associated with a reduction\
    \ in the annual growth rate of state-level output of 0.15\u20130.25 percentage\
    \ points."
  3: All Industries = -0.256 (0.060); this is the sum of all the industry coefficients
    multiplied by the corresponding industry share representing the effect of summer
    temperature on GDP.
  4: A reduction in annual nominal GDP growth rate by up to 1.2 percentage points
    due to projected temperature increases.
  6: The study uses nominal GSP data from 1957-2012 for all 50 states and the District
    of Columbia. They calculate GSP using data on labor and capital in industries
    located in each state.
  7: Increase in average summer temperature negatively affects GSP growth rate; Increase
    in average fall temperature positively affects GSP growth rate (to a lesser extent);
    Correlation of seasonal temperatures is typically very low.
  8: Estimated coefficients for the effect of average annual and seasonal temperatures
    on GSP and GDP growth are provided, along with standard errors and significance
    levels. Time series analysis shows a coefficient of -0.396 for annual temperature
    on GDP growth, while panel analysis (state-level GSP) yields coefficients ranging
    from -0.154 to 0.102 for seasonal temperatures.
  11: "Table 2 reports estimated coefficients (\u03B2) for the effect of contemporaneous\
    \ and one-year lagged seasonal temperatures on economic growth. Includes standard\
    \ errors and significance levels."

    in the full sample and -0.246 in the post-1990 sample; the fall temperature coefficient
    is not statistically significant post-1990.

    productivity growth (-0.152, significant at the 5% or 1% levels in at least one
    specification). A 1 degree Fahrenheit drop in average fall temperature is detrimental
    for productivity (0.132, significant at the 5% or 1% levels in at least one specification).
  15: Automobile manufacturing plants experience an average 8% reduction in output
    due to temperature effects.
  16: Breaks down the total GSP of each state into 12 large industry groups according
    to the BEA classifications to investigate industry-level effects.

    temperature on industry output growth, such as -0.219 for professional and business
    services, -0.253 for other services, -0.387 for food services, among others.
  19: "A 1\xB0F increase in the average summer temperature is associated with a 0.24\u2013\
    0.28 percentage points reduction in the output growth of the retail and wholesale\
    \ sectors (6.6% and 5.9% of national GDP, respectively) in the post-1997 sample;\
    \ a 1\xB0F increase in the average summer temperature is associated with a 0.44\
    \ percentage points reduction in the output growth of the real estate sector (11.4%\
    \ of national GDP) in the post-1997 sample; increase in the average summer temperature\
    \ negatively affects insurance, insurance carriers, and related activities (2.6%\
    \ of national GDP)."
  20: "A 1\xB0F increase in average summer temperature is associated with a 1.30 percentage\
    \ points reduction in the output growth of the agriculture, forestry, and fishing\
    \ sector (post-1997 sample)."

  24: "Table 6 provides regression results showing the estimated coefficients (\u03B2\
    s and \u03B4s) and standard errors for the effect of seasonal temperature on GSP\
    \ growth in the South region and the whole U.S. The coefficient on summer temperature\
    \ is negative and significant in both the South and the U.S. The interaction between\
    \ lower HDI (Human Development Index) and summer temperature is positive and marginally\
    \ significant."
  25: Projections of temperature impacts on GDP growth rates using coefficients from
    panel regression analysis.
  26: Under the conservative emission scenario (B1), projected reduction of 0.2-0.4
    percentage points in the growth rate of U.S. output over the next 100 years; under
    the high emission scenario (A2), estimated reductions could be as large as 1.2
    percentage points.
  27: The table presents coefficients representing the estimated impact on GSP under
    different robustness checks, along with standard errors. Significant coefficients
    are indicated by asterisks (*, **, ***).
  28: Yes, coefficient estimates for the relationship between seasonal temperatures
    and GSP growth, along with standard errors and significance levels.  For example,

    (significant at the 1% level in one specification and 5% in another).  Many other
    coefficient estimates are reported for different model specifications and seasons.
  29: Increase in average summer temperature has a strong negative effect on economic
    growth rates; in some cases, the magnitudes of the estimated summer coefficients
    are even larger than those obtained in our baseline specification; increase in
    the average fall temperature does not appear to have a significant effect on real
    GSP growth; when we adopt the meteorological definition, the coefficient on summer
    temperature is negative, although only statistically significant at the 5% level
    if standard errors are clustered by state.

    industries (Services, Finance, Insurance, Real Estate, Manufacturing, Government,
    Retail, Wholesale, Communication/Information, Construction, Transportation, Utilities,
    Mining, Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing) broken down into pre-1997 and post-1997
    periods.
  50: The figure displays boxplots showing the distribution of data across different
    cases and seasons. The y-axis ranges from -0.2 to 0.1, suggesting the data are
    normalized. However, without knowing what is being plotted it is impossible to
    extract specific information. The x-axis has the labels 123456789 and 101112,
    probably showing groups or variables.
