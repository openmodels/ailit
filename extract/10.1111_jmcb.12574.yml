  56: Human capital, allocation of time
Highlights:
  1: Rising temperatures could reduce U.S. economic growth by up to one-third over
    the next century.
  2: Rising summer temperatures negatively affect the growth rate of GSP, while rising
    fall temperatures positively affect this growth rate (to a lesser extent). The
    U.S. economy is still sensitive to temperature increases despite adaptive technologies.
    Temperature effects are particularly strong in states with relatively higher summer
    temperatures, most of which are located in the South. Rising summer temperatures
    have a pervasive effect across many industries.
  4: Projected increases in summer and fall temperatures could reduce the growth rate
    of annual nominal GDP by up to 1.2 percentage points.
  5: Establishes a connection between long-term temperature changes and economic activities.
  7: Increase in summer temperature negatively impacts GSP growth; increase in fall
    temperature positively impacts GSP growth (to a lesser extent). Temperature volatility
    contributes to GDP volatility.
  8: The estimated coefficients for the impact of temperature on economic growth are
    generally not statistically significant.
  9: Summer temperatures show a robust negative effect on GSP growth rates, while
    fall temperatures have a positive but less robust impact on GSP growth rates.
  10: 'Distinguishes between three cases: No Effect (temperature has no economic impact),
    Level Effect (temperature has a permanent impact on the level of output), and
    Growth Effect (temperature permanently affects both the level and the growth rate
    of output).'
  11: Lagged temperatures are statistically significant in affecting economic growth
    for spring, summer, and fall, but not winter; summer temperatures have the most
    notable negative impact.
  12: Summer temperatures have a negative and statistically significant effect on
    output growth, which is robust. The effect of fall temperatures is not robust,
    and is not statistically significant in the post-1990 sample. Summer and fall
    temperatures affect the growth of labor productivity. Summer temperature increases
    negatively affect output growth in various industries (food services and drinking
    places; insurance; wholesale; retail; and agriculture, forestry, and fishing)
    and positively affects growth in the utilities and mining sectors in the post-1997
    sample. The effect of temperature on GSP is particularly strong in Southern states.
  13: The stability across time of the effect of average seasonal temperatures on
    GSP growth is analyzed.
  14: Summer temperatures negatively affect productivity growth, and fall temperatures
    also seem to be detrimental for productivity growth. A main mechanism through
    which summer and fall temperatures affect GSP growth is productivity growth, rather
    than employment growth. The association between average summer and fall temperatures
    and the growth rate of employment is not statistically significant.
  15: High temperatures negatively affect worker productivity, especially in interface
    areas. High temperatures also have a negative impact on health, increasing hospitalization
    risk and costs, and potentially affecting the insurance sector.
  16: High summer temperatures may affect household demand in the retail sector (shopping
    productivity, perception of wait time, social interactions).
  18: Several industry groups show statistically significant negative impacts from
    average summer temperature (e.g., Food services and drinking places, Insurance
    carriers and related activities). Some industries show a positive correlation
    (Arts, entertainment and recreation, Funds, trusts and other financial vehicles),
    though these estimates may not be statistically significant.
  19: "Summer temperature has a negative impact on retail, wholesale, real estate,\
    \ and insurance sectors in the post-1997 period. The impact on retail and wholesale\
    \ sectors is a reduction of 0.24-0.28 percentage points in output growth per 1\xB0\
    F increase in temperature. The impact on the real estate sector is a reduction\
    \ of 0.44 percentage points in output growth per 1\xB0F increase in temperature."
  20: Higher summer temperatures negatively affect a large cross-section of industries,
    accounting for more than a third of national GDP. The growth rates of GSP in Southern
    states are particularly sensitive to summer and fall temperatures.
  21: Summer temperature has a non-linear impact on GSP growth, with the warmest states
    experiencing a larger negative impact. The South's contribution to overall U.S.
    GSP/GDP has substantially increased during the period 1957-2012.
  26: 'Rising temperatures are projected to reduce the growth rate of U.S. GDP, with
    more aggressive emission scenarios leading to larger reductions. The projected
    reductions in output growth due to rising temperatures could be as large as 1.2
    percentage point under the A2 emission scenario. '
  28: The negative relationship between average summer temperature and GSP growth
    is very robust.  The positive relationship between average fall temperature and
    growth is not supported in several robustness checks.
  31: The effect of summer temperatures is stronger in the states that are on average
    warmer than the rest of the country.
  32: High correlation in daily temperature reported across weather stations in a
    given area (Nashville and Las Vegas) supports using weather area data to avoid
    missing daily data.
  33: The table provides the ranking of U.S. states by average summer temperature.
    Wald tests results indicate p-values for significance of temperature effects on
    growth for different seasons with various lag structures.
  34: Table A5 shows the first-order autocorrelations of nominal GDP growth rates
    for each U.S. state, with standard errors and significance levels. Table A6 reports
    the median seasonal temperature correlations along with the 90% confidence intervals
    for the cross section of U.S. states. Table A7 examines the effect of season variables
    on an outcome variable; specifically, this table assesses the robustness of Table
    1 from the main text using gridded data; standard errors are clustered by year
    and state.
  35: Significant negative impacts on summer productivity and post-1997 Gross State
    Product, with summer and post-1997 effects being particularly strong.
  36: No relevant information
  38: No relevant information
  39: Summer temperatures have a statistically significant negative impact on productivity.
    The impact of lagged spring temperatures are also included.
  40: Temperature changes have statistically significant negative impacts on overall
    GDP and several sectors (e.g., finance, retail) and statistically significant
    positive impacts on some sectors (e.g., Utilities). The impact varies across sectors
    and between the pre-1997 and post-1997 periods. Agriculture is particularly negatively
    impacted.
  41: Several sectors show statistically significant (at least at the 10% level, indicated
    by * or **) impacts of temperature on GDP share. Real estate and insurance sectors
    in the finance/real estate grouping have relatively large negative impacts.
  42: Table A18 shows the relationship between temperature and economic activity is
    region-specific (North, South, Midwest, West) and seasonally specific (Winter,
    Spring, Summer, Fall). Table A19 includes 1-year lag for temperature and assesses
    contemporaneous temperature effects as well as the effects of the lag. Several
    coefficients are statistically significant (indicated by *, **, and ***).
  43: Temperature has a statistically significant negative impact on Gross State Product
    overall. The impact on Agriculture, forestry, and fishing is also significantly
    negative and large. Impacts vary across sectors, with some sectors showing less
    sensitivity or even potentially positive relationships. The statistical significance
    of results varies depending on whether contemporaneous or lagged temperature is
    used. Some sector-specific impacts appear significant using both contemporaneous
    and lagged temperature.
  44: The analysis shows statistically significant negative coefficients for the impact
    of temperature changes on many sectors including services, finance/real estate,
    wholesale, and construction, indicating these sectors are adversely affected by
    temperature changes.
  45: The analysis finds statistically significant negative impacts of temperature
    on professional and business services, other services except government, food
    services and drinking places, real estate, and insurance carriers and related
    activities in some specifications.
  46: The Sum of coefficients row may show whether temperatures are impactful across
    a whole year
  47: Impacts vary across sectors (GSP, Finance, Services, Agriculture, Insurance
    Carriers, Arts and Entertainment, etc.) and across seasons. Summer exhibits a
    statistically significant negative impact (***) while Fall exhibits a statistically
    significant positive impact (**).
  48: The results show variable impacts of summer temperatures on GDP growth across
    different industries, and the table robustness checks indicate effects on productivity
    and employment.
  50: The inclusion of different seasons in the regressions significantly impacts
    the results, showing variations in the central tendency and spread of the data,
    specifically for the money, credit and banking industry.
  51: Real estate appears to be significantly negatively impacted. Some service sectors,
    like 'Food services and drinking places', are negatively impacted. There is a
    strong positive impact from Fall in the South.
Methodology:
  2: Panel regression framework using growth rate of state gross domestic product
    (GDP) or gross state product (GSP) and average seasonal temperatures of each U.S.
    state. The summer effect dominates the fall effect in their recent sample (post-1990).
  4: The analysis combines estimates of the effects of seasonal temperatures on the
    growth rate of U.S. output with projections of expected U.S. temperature change
    under a 'business as usual' benchmark, and is applicable over the next century.
  5: Uses daily station-level weather data from NOAA Northeast Regional Climate Center
    from 1957-2012, aggregates to quarterly averages, deseasonalizes data, analyzes
    average seasonal temperatures; robustness checks are included in section 4.3 and
    the appendix.
  6: "Uses NOAA U.S. Climate Divisions\u2019 nClimDiv data set as an alternative temperature\
    \ data set, which provides absolute monthly temperature averages for each state,\
    \ derived from area-weighted averages of 5 km \xD7 5 km grid-point temperature\
    \ estimates interpolated from station data."
  7: Panel regressions using weather and economic data from all 50 U.S. states plus
    the District of Columbia. Includes lagged dependent variable and average seasonal
    temperatures. Time-series regressions of national GDP growth on average annual
    temperature.
  8: Time series regressions use national GDP and weather data from 1957-2012; Panel
    regressions use state-level GSP and weather data from 1957-2012 with state and
    year fixed effects and GSP weighting.
  9: "The analysis disaggregates annual average temperature into seasonal averages\
    \ using panel regressions weighted by state GSP relative to national GDP, with\
    \ robust checks using Arellano\u2013Bond estimation."
  10: "Simulates the effect of a permanent 1\xB0F temperature increase on output growth\
    \ over time using a simplified model. The model considers both the immediate and\
    \ lagged effects of temperature on output growth."
  11: The analysis uses a regression approach to estimate the effects of contemporaneous
    and lagged seasonal temperatures on economic growth from 1957-2012, with results
    weighted by constant GSP shares and standard errors clustered by year and state.
  12: Panel regression is used. The sample is delayed one year at a time until starting
    in 1990 to explore coefficient evolution through time. Econometric specification
    omits lagged temperatures for parsimony.
  13: The analysis uses panel regressions for the entire cross section of the U.S.,
    with each state weighted by its relative GSP. Regressions include state and year
    fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the year level. The coefficients
    are estimated over samples starting with the year reported on the horizontal axis
    and ending in 2012. Linear fits of the dots are also shown.
  14: "Panel regressions of state productivity growth rate and employment growth rate\
    \ on temperatures, using data from 50 states and the District of Columbia from\
    \ 1990\u20132011. Includes lagged dependent variable, state, and year fixed effects.\
    \ States are weighted by their GSP relative to the whole country. Standard errors\
    \ are clustered by year, state, and both dimensions."
  15: The analysis involves panel regressions and is guided by microlevel evidence
    of mechanisms through which temperature may affect economic activities. The results
    from the analysis on this page are applicable to developed countries.
  16: Regression analysis of industry-level GSP growth on summer temperatures, performed
    separately for pre- and post-1997 subsamples due to changes in industry classification
    (SIC to NAICS).
  18: Panel regressions of industry output growth are performed using state-level
    data from 1997-2011. The analysis includes state and year fixed effects, and states
    are weighted by their proportion of national industry output. Standard errors
    are clustered by year, by state, and by both dimensions. Significance levels are
    denoted as 1%, 5%, and 10%.
  19: Regression analysis using data from 1963-2011, with separate estimates for pre-1997
    (1963-1997) and post-1997 (1997-2011) periods. Standard errors are clustered by
    year, state, and both dimensions. Some sub-sector analysis is only conducted for
    the post-1997 sample due to data limitations.
  20: 'Panel regressions of the growth rate of state-level GSP on temperatures, divided
    U.S. into four regions: North, South, Midwest, and West.'
  21: "Panel regressions of state GSP growth rate on temperatures, using the cross-section\
    \ of U.S. states in each region (defined by the Census Bureau). Includes lagged\
    \ dependent variable, state and year fixed effects. States are weighted by their\
    \ proportion of regional GDP. Sample period: 1957\u20132012. Standard errors are\
    \ clustered by year, by state, and by both dimensions."
  26: 'The analysis uses a regression model to estimate the impact of seasonal temperature
    changes on economic growth for the period 2070-2099, using three emission scenarios
    (A2, A1B, B1). The regression model (4) with robustness checks in table 7 is used
    with temperature impact coefficient of summer and fall. '
  27: "The analysis involves robustness checks using alternative panel weights, GSP\
    \ measures, de\uFB01nitions of seasons, and temperature data."
  28: The analysis involves panel regressions using state-level data from 1957-2012,
    with some exceptions. Robustness checks include using alternative temperature
    data, controlling for spatial correlation, precipitation, and temperature volatility,
    excluding AR(1) terms, and excluding Alaska and Hawaii. States are weighted by
    GSP, population, or area, depending on the robustness check. Standard errors are
    clustered by year, state, and both dimensions. Significance is indicated at the
    1%, 5%, and 10% levels.
  31: "Uses weather data from 129 weather areas featuring 10,128 individual weather\
    \ stations. Includes individual stations if they have at least 60 daily observations\
    \ per season for each season in the sample (1957\u20132012)."
  32: The analysis uses weather data series compiled from multiple weather stations
    in a given area to extend the data series and address missing data. The example
    uses Nashville, TN, data from 1871-2014 compiled from three stations. Only stations
    reporting at least 60 daily observations per season for each season in the sample
    1957-2012 are included.
  33: The paper calculates average summer temperatures for each state over the sample
    period 1957-2012 using NOAA monthly temperature data. It also performs Wald tests
    of growth versus level regression, including two and five lags of temperatures
    and one lag with no lagged dependent variable.
  34: Reports first-order autocorrelations of nominal GDP growth rates for each U.S.
    state. Reports median seasonal temperature correlations along with 90% confidence
    intervals. Reports panel analysis coefficients for temperature.
  36: The analysis compares coefficients pre-1997 and post-1997. Standard errors are
    clustered by year and state. Missing seasonal data is imputed by replacing it
    with the mean of the seasonal average of all stations if a station does not report
    at least 60 daily observations in that season from 1957-2012. Mean correlation
    between stations in Nashville (0.9959) and Las Vegas (0.9463).
  37: The results utilize gridded data and standard errors are clustered by year and
    state.
  38: The analysis involves panel regressions and deseasonalization of temperature
    data. Standard errors are clustered by year and state. Deseasonalization is performed
    by regressing raw temperature on monthly dummies and station fixed effects.

    text provides further methodological notes.
  45: The analysis uses regression models including contemporary temperature and a
    one-year lag of temperature to predict impacts on various service and finance
    sectors. Standard errors are clustered by year and by state. The Wald test is
    used to evaluate the significance of the sum of coefficients.
  46: The analysis uses regression with standard errors clustered by year and state.
    It incorporates both contemporaneous and lagged temperature variables. The results
    are applicable to the specified US regions and seasons.
  47: Panel analysis using Arellano-Bond estimation. Robust standard errors are used.
    Industry analysis is conducted, with results presented as standardized regression
    coefficients.
  48: The analysis uses the Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data methodology to account
    for first-order autocorrelation and includes lagged dependent variables in the
    empirical specification.
  49: "The analysis utilizes Arellano\u2013Bond estimation and includes robustness\
    \ checks with additional specifications incorporating different seasonal variables."

  56: Working paper, journal article
More Notes:
  2: The paper suggests that previous studies' aggregation of temperature data into
    annual averages may mask the heterogenous effects of different seasons.
  5: The paper analyzes the effect of temperature on labor productivity, the growth
    rate of output in the cross section of industries, and in the cross section of
    U.S. regions; it also analyzes the long-term consequences of global warming for
    the aggregate U.S. economy.
  7: Authors claim results are unlikely to be affected by multicollinearity because
    of low correlation of seasonal temperatures (Table A6).
  8: Temperatures are measured in degrees Fahrenheit.
  10: Figure 2 illustrates the differences between level and growth effects of temperature
    increases on output over 50 years.

    September, and fall as October\u2013December."
  15: The page challenges the perception that the effects of global warming are limited
    to agriculture-related sectors.

    of agricultural income on retail and real estate. The study uses BEA data and
    acknowledges limitations due to changes in industry classifications over time.
    The model includes state and year fixed effects.
  18: The analysis uses data from 50 states and DC.
