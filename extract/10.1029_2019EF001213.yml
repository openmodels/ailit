Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change impacts on agricultural production and global markets.
  3: Food security affected by domestic and abroad production affecting domestic supply
    and consumption.
  4: Climate change is not explicitly mentioned, but the drivers of risk listed (food
    insecurity, volatile export earnings, dependence on few suppliers, risk of trade
    disruption) could be exacerbated by climate change impacts on agriculture and
    trade.
  6: Change in capital (dK), Change in climate impact on productivity (d(tau)C), Change
    in land productivity
  8: Climate change impact on yield of maize, wheat and rice.
  10: Climate change impacts on rice, wheat, and maize production.
  12: Temperature (dominant driver), precipitation (marginally positive impact).
  14: Temperature change impacts under RCP8.5 scenario in 2100 affecting grain production.
  16: Grain self-sufficiency ratios indicate vulnerability to climate change impacts.
  17: Temperature changes for RCP4.5, 2050T
  18: Climate change (CC) impacts via land productivity, specifically under RCP8.5
    2100T scenario.
  19: Direct climate change impacts via land productivity, especially for wheat, driving
    changes in grain self-sufficiency and consumption.
  20: Direct climate change impacts via land productivity, particularly for wheat
    and maize.
  21: Direct climate change impacts on land productivity.
  22: Temperature changes under the RCP8.5 scenario in 2100 impact grain prices and
    farm income.
  23: Climate change (CC) and its impact on grain production; Specific RCPs (4.5,
    8.5, 2.6); Failure to adapt well.
Highlights:
  2: Climate change may impact grain self-sufficiency, especially through global markets.
    Study compares scenarios with and without adaptation measures.
  6: The analysis focuses on how changes in capital and climate impact grain self-sufficiency.
  12: Climate change, primarily driven by temperature, is projected to significantly
    reduce global grain production, especially under high-emission scenarios (RCP8.5).
    Adaptation can mitigate these losses, but significant reductions are still expected.
  14: Peru, Japan, Korea, Armenia, Sweden, and Latvia are identified as benefiting
    in certain scenarios, particularly under RCP8.5 in 2100.
  16: Simulation indicates climate change does not alter current grain self-sufficiency
    picture significantly, but impacts exist.
  17: Grain self-sufficiency rates are projected to change by 17% due to temperature
    changes under RCP4.5 by 2050T.
  18: Direct climate change impacts on land productivity are considerable, especially
    for maize; production effects largely offset these impacts; consumption is marginally
    reduced overall; analysis suggests varied impacts across different crops.
  19: Grain self-sufficiency rate reduces by over 17%, wheat by a significant amount;
    grain consumption reduces markedly by 7%, wheat consumption by 9%. More imported
    grain necessary.
  20: Direct climate change impacts on land productivity are considerable, especially
    for wheat and maize. Grain self-sufficiency rate is increased slightly, mainly
    due to maize.
  21: Direct climate change impacts via land productivity are considerable, especially
    for rice. Production effects cancel out all the direct climate change impacts
    leading to relatively stable consumption.
  22: All regions benefit from increased grain prices, with significant gains in farm
    income in the USA, China, India, and Pakistan.
  23: Global warming reduces grain production. Russia may suffer the most in terms
    of self-sufficiency; USA and India in tonnes of output. Adaptation significantly
    reduces potential losses. Impact in 2100 stronger than 2050 in RCP4.5 and 8.5.
Methodology:
  2: Uses a global multimarket model to simulate the impacts of climate change on
    grain self-sufficiency.
  6: The paper employs a production function approach (F(K, tau C) * L) to model grain
    production and calculates self-sufficiency ratios based on production and net
    imports. The analysis considers changes in capital, climate impact on land productivity,
    and consumption.
  7: 'The models are interconnected in a sequence: Climate Model -> Econometric Model
    (Direct climate change impact on crop yields) -> Multi-sectoral economic model
    (GRACE) -> Grain Self-sufficiency.'
  8: Calculate country-level average climate data from 32 climate models in ensembles
    of CMIP5; Calculate CC impact on yield of maize, wheat and rice by econometric
    model (Moore et al 2017); Calculate average rates of yield changes by country;
    Economic impacts are estimated by GRACE.
  10: The analysis uses climate data (CMIP5), an econometric model on climate change
    impacts on crops (Moore et al., 2018), and a global Input-Output Matrix (GTAP
    database v9) to assess the impact of climate change on crop production (rice,
    wheat, and maize).
  12: Comparative scenario analysis using different RCPs (2.6, 4.5, 8.5) to project
    grain production losses with and without adaptation. The bar chart shows results
    for 2050 and 2100, considering temperature (T) and temperature & precipitation
    (T&P).
More Notes:
  2: Focus is on agricultural sustainability and food security in the context of climate
    change.
  4: This page focuses on the *motivation* for countries pursuing food self-sufficiency
    policies. While not directly about climate change impacts, it highlights vulnerabilities
    that climate change could worsen, making the underlying issues more relevant to
    a macro-fiscal risk assessment of climate change. The page refers to a potential
    impact channel; climate change may lead to greater food insecurity and disruption
    to international trade. This will put pressure on national governments.
  6: The Cicero logo indicates the issuing organization for the paper.
  10: The data sources suggest a quantitative, model-based approach to assessing climate
    change impacts on crop production, which can then be linked to economic outcomes.
    The mentioned global I-O matrix can capture economy-wide effects. CICERO Shades
    of Green is related to climate and environmental research and ratings, but this
    is not directly described in the extract.
  17: The map data provide visual context of SSR, consumption, land use, and production,
    which could be used in conjunction with the 17% self-sufficiency change projection.
  18: The analysis appears to be specific to China. The 'CICERO Shades of Green' logo
    suggests the source may be related to environmental research or sustainable finance
    assessment. The RCP8.5 2100T scenario refers to a specific climate change projection
    with a time horizon, but its specifics are not elucidated.
  20: The production effects tend to offset the direct climate change impacts. Consumption
    of grains, particularly wheat, is projected to decrease significantly.
  21: The analysis focuses on the impact of climate change on grain production and
    consumption in Europe under the RCP8.5 scenario by 2100. The bar chart provides
    a visual comparison of Self-Sufficiency Ratio (SSR), Land, Production, and Consumption
    across rice, wheat, maize, and grain.
  23: The analysis considers the impact of CO2 fertilization. The impact on self-sufficiency
    may be overestimated if behavior adjustments of economic agents are not considered.
