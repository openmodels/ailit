Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate risk
  6: Climate risk is identified as a driver affecting the stock market, sovereign
    risk, and competitiveness.
  7: Public sector corruption (CPI), Political instability (PSI), Government regulation
    of financial services (FFI)
  9: Climate Risk Index (CRI)
  10: Climate risk (as an explanatory factor for competitiveness), Macroeconomic factors
    (economic growth, inflation rate), Governance factors (control of corruption,
    political stability), Financial factors (financial freedom)
  11: Climate Risk (CRI), GDP per capita (GDPc), Inflation (INF), Unemployment (UNE),
    Consumer Price Index (CPI), Political Stability Index (PSI), Financial Freedom
    Index (FFI), Corruption (COR), Political Rights Index (POL), Financial Institution
    Non-Performing Loans (FINF)
  12: Climate risk.
  13: Climate risk
Highlights:
  2: Climate risks negatively impact stock market capitalization and increase sovereign
    risk in countries with lower credit default swap (CDS) levels. The level of climate
    risk has a small influence on competitiveness.
  6: The use of quantiles regression is highlighted as a novel contribution, allowing
    identification of levels at which climate risk impacts are statistically significant.
  9: The climate risk index (CRI) has a low correlation with the other explanatory
    factors included in the analysis (GDPc, INF, UNE, CPI, PSI, FFI), suggesting that
    some macroeconomic variables are unconditioned by climate events.
  10: Macroeconomic factors, governance factors, and financial factors influence sovereign
    CDS. Economic growth influences CDS at the 90th quantile, inflation rate for all
    quantiles except the 90th, control of corruption at all quantiles, political stability
    at the 75th quantile, and financial freedom at the 50th quantile.
  11: Climate risk has a statistically significant positive impact on CDS quotes for
    countries with very low sovereign risk (q10). The impact of climate risk on sovereign
    risk is better identified in countries with a very high degree of economic and
    financial complexity and increased political stability.
  12: Increasing climate risk has a negative impact on market capitalization, particularly
    for countries with mid-range market capitalization. The impact on market capitalization
    is monotonically decreasing from small quantiles (q25) to large quantiles (q90).
    Climate risk impacts the ability of countries to deliver goods and services to
    competitive markets.
  13: Climate risk does not strongly impact countries with low or very high levels
    of market capitalization. Climate risk leads to increased country risk only in
    cases of low budget deficit. There is a negative correlation between climate risk
    and competitiveness, but statistically insignificant.
Methodology:
  1: Panel data approach
  2: Quantile regression, logistic regression, panel data approach.
  6: The study uses quantiles regression and LOGIT regression to analyze the impact
    of climate risk on stock market capitalization, sovereign risk, and competitiveness.
  7: Panel data approach using data from Bloomberg, Knoema, The Global Economy, and
    Heritage Fundation.
  9: Panel data quantile regression is used to assess the impact of climate risk on
    sovereign CDS and stock market capitalization, as a linear regression might overlook
    links due to heterogeneity between countries. Quantile regression is used because
    the dependent variable is assumed to have an asymmetric distribution.
  10: Logistic regression (LOGIT model) to identify the determinants of competitiveness
    and the influence of climate risk. Quantile regression used to analyze sovereign
    CDS, with quantiles representing different levels of sovereign risk.
  11: Quantile regression on panel data, looking at how economic and political factors
    and Climate Risk affect sovereign CDS spreads and market capitalization at different
    quantiles. The CDS analysis is especially applicable to countries with high economic
    and financial complexity and political stability.
  12: Quantile regression is used to assess the impact of climate risk on market capitalization.
    LOGIT regression is used to assess the impact of climate risk on competitiveness.
  13: Panel data approach using logistic regression and quantile regressions. The
    study uses sovereign CDS quotations as a proxy for sovereign risk.
More Notes:
  2: The analysis uses a sample of 22 countries (16 EU members and 6 OECD members)
    during the 2008-2019 period.
  6: The study's sample consists of 263 observations, selected based on availability
    of climate risk index data.
  7: The paper aims to assess the impact of climate risk on the economy.
  10: The competitiveness index is treated as a binary variable, with 1 representing
    the country being above the first 25% of observations and 0 representing below.
  11: The sensitivity of country risk to economic, financial, and political factors
    is stronger when sovereign CDS spreads are extremely high (90th quantile).
  12: The impact of climate risk on market capitalization is not significant for countries
    with very low or very high market capitalization. Table 6 includes variables GDPc,
    INF, UNE, COR, POL, FINF, and CRI in the LOGIT estimation, and their influence
    is estimated based on binary approach, in which *UNE* and *COR* have the most
    positive influence on competitiveness, while *POL* has the most negative influence.
  13: The study acknowledges limitations in accurately estimating the impact of climate
    change on sovereign risk in all countries or those with high sovereign risk. The
    authors suggest developing an indicator to assess the impact of climate risk on
    competitiveness.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: GDP effects
  2: Sovereign risk, stock market evolution, and the degree of competitiveness.
  6: The paper focuses on changes in stock market capitalization, sovereign risk,
    and competitiveness as macroeconomic outcomes linked to climate risk.
  7: Sovereign Risk (CDS), Stock market capitalisation (MC), Global competitiveness
    (GCI), GDP per capita (GDPc), Inflation rate (INF), Unemployment rate (UNE)
  9: GDP, inflation (INF), unemployment (UNE), Consumer Price Index (CPI), and a sovereign
    risk measure (CDS, though not listed in the correlation matrix). The study also
    considers the evolution of stock market capitalization.
  10: Competitiveness index of a country, Sovereign Credit Default Swap (CDS)
  11: Sovereign Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads, Market Capitalization as a percentage
    of GDP
  12: Stock market capitalization; National competitiveness (ability to deliver goods
    and services to competitive markets).
  13: Global competitiveness of a country, market capitalization, and sovereign risk
Quantitative material:
  2: Negative relationship between climate risks and the evolution of stock market
    capitalization as a percentage of GDP; climate risk leads to an increase in sovereign
    risk only across inferior quantiles; the level of competitiveness of a country
    is influenced to a small extent by the level of climate risk.

    (2008-2019).
