Drivers of Risk:
  1: Hydroclimate variability (precipitation, river streamflow, temperature) driven
    by ENSO and SSTs in the South Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans.
  2: Hydroclimate variability due to interannual to multidecadal changes in SST, ENSO
    and NAO cycles, and influences from PDV and SACZ.
  6: Interannual-to-multidecadal hydroclimate variability, sea surface temperature
    patterns, precipitation anomalies, ENSO pattern
  8: "The dominant drivers of risk are extreme El Ni\xF1o events and interannual hydroclimate\
    \ variability, particularly cycles of approximately 6, 4, and 2.5 years."
  10: Hydroclimate variability and its extremes, intense precipitation events, persistent
    events affecting water supply management, extreme ENSO conditions causing floods
    or droughts, decadal-to-multidecadal timescales (including trends) affecting precipitation
    and streamflow variability.
  11: "Interannual variability (El Ni\xF1o/La Ni\xF1a), interannual to multidecadal\
    \ variability (severe hydrological droughts), and decadal to multidecadal variability\
    \ (increased precipitation and flooding)."
  14: River floods, pluvial floods, droughts, heatwaves, interannual-to-multidecadal
    hydroclimate variability (precipitation, streamflow, and near-surface temperature),
    extreme ENSO conditions, SST forcing in the North Tropical Atlantic Ocean and
    the South Atlantic Convergence Zone, land use changes, changes in groundwater
    table levels, reduced soil infiltration capacity, increased surface runoff
  15: Increases in minimum temperature reducing wheat yields and altering maize life
    cycles; changes in maximum and minimum temperatures exacerbating the effects of
    urban heat islands and affecting energy demand.
Highlights:
  1: Interannual hydroclimatic variability centers on 2.5-6.5 year (ENSO) and 9-year
    frequencies. Interdecadal variability includes trends and oscillations causing
    a shift from dryer/cooler to wetter/warmer conditions since the mid-20th century.
    Floods between 1970-2005 affected agricultural productivity and caused population
    displacement. Agricultural droughts resulted in soil moisture deficits affecting
    crops. Increases in minimum temperature reduced wheat and barley yields.
  2: The paper discusses the variability modes and their SST forcing factors and their
    influence on extreme events and explores their sectoral impacts over different
    timescales.

  8: "Extraordinary floods in the Paran\xE1 River are linked to strong El Ni\xF1o\
    \ events. The 6-year cycle is the largest contributor to the formation of extraordinary\
    \ floods. Local precipitation in the NEA region contributes to lower Paran\xE1\
    \ River streamflow, especially during peak flood events."
  10: Northeastern Argentina's water resources are highly sensitive to hydroclimate
    variability. Severe droughts were more frequent before 1960 and severely affected
    regional economies. Precipitation and streamflow increased after the 1970s, with
    frequent wet extreme events between 1970 and 2005.
  11: Hydroclimate variability at different timescales has distinct impacts on water
    resources, ranging from flooding and droughts to increased precipitation and groundwater
    levels.
  13: No relevant information
  14: Interannual hydrological variability induced frequent floods and droughts related
    to extreme ENSO conditions and SST forcing, which affected agricultural and livestock
    productivity and human settlements. Decadal-to-multidecadal timescales saw a transition
    from dry/cooler to wet/warmer conditions, impacting agriculture and leading to
    extraordinary floods.
  15: The combination of interannual and multidecadal hydroclimatic variability intensified
    extreme events, leading to severe droughts and large floods. A reversal in the
    wetting period in northeastern Argentina may lead to more severe droughts and
    weaker floods.
Methodology:
  1: Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular spectrum analysis (SSA) are used
    to identify patterns of variability, trends, and cycles in hydroclimate data.
    The analysis is applicable to northeastern Argentina.
  2: Examine century-long datasets of precipitation, river flow, air temperature,
    and SST using multivariate statistical methods to describe historic regional hydroclimate
    variability.
  6: Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) applied to principal components (PCs) of sea
    surface temperature (SST) and precipitation data. Correlation analysis and Monte
    Carlo simulations used to assess significance.
  8: "The analysis uses streamflow time series data from the Paran\xE1 River at Timb\xFA\
    es station, partial reconstruction with interannual and decadal variability modes,\
    \ Pearson correlation coefficients to assess the relationship with ENSO, and Monte\
    \ Carlo simulations to estimate significance levels."
  10: The paper references the use of 18-month low-pass filtered monthly time series,
    partial reconstructions using interannual and low-frequency variability modes,
    and Pearson correlation coefficients. Significance levels are estimated using
    Monte Carlo iterations considering autocorrelation by resampling in the frequency
    domain.

More Notes:
  6: The paper focuses on analyzing hydroclimate variability and its relationship
    to SST and precipitation patterns at different timescales. While it identifies
    trends, periodicities, and correlations, it does not directly link these to macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes, or the costs/benefits of adaptation at a national level.
  8: The study suggests a localized impact of NEA precipitation on flood intensity,
    highlighting the importance of regional factors in addition to large-scale climate
    drivers.
  13: The table summarizes the impacts of hydroclimate variability and its extremes
    in agriculture at different timescales (decadal to multidecadal, interannual to
    multidecadal).
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Agricultural and livestock productivity are affected by both floods and droughts.

  8: "Extraordinary floods of the Paran\xE1 River are a key outcome, with potential\
    \ implications for economic activity and infrastructure in the affected region."
  10: "Droughts affected navigability of the Paran\xE1 River, leading to complications\
    \ to export grains and transport fuel. Very low levels of the Paran\xE1 and Uruguay\
    \ rivers hindered water extraction for supply, leading to shortages of drinking\
    \ water and pollution problems. The Salto Grande hydropower plant on the Uruguay\
    \ River generated only 10% of its energy capacity during droughts, impacting energy\
    \ security."
