Drivers of Risk:
  2: Anthropogenic emissions increase the concentration of greenhouse gases, resulting
    in radiative forcing on the Earth system.
  3: Radiative forcing F resulting from greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone precursors,
    land use change, and other anthropogenic influences.
  5: Temperature projections under shared socioeconomic pathways SSP4-6.0 and SSP3-7.0;
    radiative forcing.
  6: Temperature changes, assessed using shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP4-6.0 and
    SSP3-7.0).

  5: Economic damages resulting from climate change.
  6: "Economic damages (in trillions of 2019 USD) are projected under socioeconomic\
    \ pathways SSP4-6.0 and SSP3-7.0 for the temperature-dependent feedback model\
    \ and the multi-model ensemble, calculated over the period 2020\u20132300."
Highlights:
  2: Structural uncertainty is crucial for integrated assessment models and general
    climate projections, dominating overall non-socioeconomic uncertainty in projections
    of climate change damages.
  3: Structural uncertainty is much larger than parametric uncertainty for projections
    of T, and consequently for calculations of damages due to climate change.
  5: "Structural uncertainty is dominant for temperature projections. A temperature-dependent\
    \ feedback model has more probability mass. A dampening nonlinearity (positive\
    \ \u03BB T or equivalently \u03BD) is found, meaning the warmer the Earth gets,\
    \ more radiative forcing is required to warm it, which is the opposite of what\
    \ is typically seen in ESMs."
  6: "Structural uncertainty is more important than parametric uncertainty for both\
    \ temperature and damages. The highest 'u' values for damages occur for the Weitzman\
    \ damage function. Reductions in structural uncertainty may be possible by incorporating\
    \ known phenomena such as the El Ni\xF1o Southern Oscillation."
Methodology:
  2: A Bayesian approach is developed to quantify structural uncertainty in climate
    projections using idealized energy-balance model representations.
  3: 'Computational Bayesian approach: (1) specifies a model, (2) specifies prior
    distributions for the parameters, (3) draws samples from these priors, (4) computes
    the relative likelihood, (5) weighs these samples according to this likelihood,
    and (6) uses this weighted ensemble to project into the future probabilistically.
    They use a standard linear Energy Balance Model (EBM).'
  4: Structural uncertainty is assessed by comparing interquartile ranges of multi-model
    projections and preferred model structure.
  5: Bayesian analysis of climate models with different feedback structures; The approach
    and default assumptions from [10] are used for damage calculations.
  6: An energy-balance model is used. Structural uncertainty is characterized using
    model selection parameters. The ratio of structural vs. parametric uncertainty
    (u) is calculated for economic damages using different damage functions, shared
    socioeconomic pathways, and discount rates.
More Notes:
  3: Focuses on structural uncertainty in a simple EBM used by several IAMs, generalisable
    to climate models with additional complexity. Structural uncertainty is substantial
    in climate economics calculations and climate projections and implies that reported
    uncertainties may be underestimated.
  5: "The sign of the posterior for \u03BB T may reflect a process that causes a lag\
    \ in climate feedback response that is dependent on the rate of change in warming.\
    \ The pattern effect is likely to be a robust feature of the climate system. The\
    \ temperature-dependent feedback model may be underestimating future warming.\
    \ The lower-than-average time series of F are excluded from the posterior."
  6: The approach to characterizing structural uncertainty is applicable to more complex
    representations of climate physics. Accounting for temperature fluctuations due
    to climate oscillations is important to avoid overfitting.
