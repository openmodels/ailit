Drivers of Risk:
  2: Parametric uncertainty, structural uncertainty, and internal variability in climate
    projections; Specifically, uncertainty in climate feedback mechanisms (temperature-dependent
    feedback).
  3: Structural uncertainty in climate models; parametric uncertainty; internal variability
  5: Temperature projections, structural uncertainty in climate models, radiative
    forcing, climate feedback response, pattern of surface warming.
  6: Temperature changes as modeled under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
    (SSPs) and the uncertainty in climate models (structural and parametric).
Highlights:
  2: Structural uncertainty is important for climate projections and dominates overall
    non-socioeconomic uncertainty in economic projections of climate change damages.
  3: Physical structural uncertainty is substantial in climate economics calculations
    and climate projections, and reported uncertainties may be underestimated.
  5: Structural uncertainty in temperature projections is dominant, and this propagates
    into economic damages. The temperature-dependent feedback model may be underestimating
    future warming.
  6: Structural uncertainty is a major driver of uncertainty in both physical and
    economic projections of climate change; the choice of damage function significantly
    affects the magnitude of projected economic damages.
Methodology:
  2: Bayesian approach to quantify structural uncertainty in climate projections using
    energy-balance model representations of climate physics; Model selection parameter
    to switch on climate nonlinearities and multidecadal climate feedbacks.
  3: Quantifies structural uncertainty in a simple energy balance model (EBM) used
    by several integrated assessment models (IAMs) using a computational Bayesian
    approach.
  5: Uses a model selection approach to analyze climate feedback and radiative forcing
    and then propagates the uncertainty in temperature projections into economic damage
    calculations using the approach from [10].
  6: Uses an energy-balance model to project temperature changes and then calculates
    economic damages based on these projections, using different damage functions
    and discount rates.
More Notes:
  2: The study finds that a model with temperature-dependent climate feedback is most
    consistent with global mean surface temperature observations, but the sign of
    the temperature dependence is opposite of what Earth system models suggest, likely
    due to representing recent pattern effects as a temperature dependence.
  6: The paper emphasizes the importance of characterizing structural uncertainty
    in climate models and suggests ways to reduce this uncertainty by incorporating
    known phenomena and leveraging observations from ocean heat content and paleorecords.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Economic projection of climate change damages using a temperature-to-damages
    calculation.
  3: Damages due to climate change; economic impacts of internal variability
  5: Economic damages resulting from climate change.
  6: Economic damages (in trillions of 2019 USD) are projected under the socioeconomic
    pathways SSP4-6.0 and SSP3-7.0.
Quantitative material:
  2: Structural uncertainty dwarfs parametric uncertainty in temperature projections
    under shared socioeconomic pathways similar to current emissions reduction targets.
  3: Structural uncertainty is much larger than parametric uncertainty for projections
    of T (temperature), and consequently for calculations of damages due to climate
    change.
  5: Shows the interquartile range of damage calculations using the approach and default
    assumptions from [10] for SSP4-6.0 and SSP3-7.0.
  6: "Damages are calculated over the period 2020\u20132300, with a default 4.255%\
    \ discount rate; the ratio of structural vs. parametric uncertainty (u) for damages\
    \ is 2.9 for SSP4-6.0 and 4.6 for SSP3-7.0; the bottom panel shows the ratio of\
    \ median multi-model versus \u03BBT model damage estimates."
