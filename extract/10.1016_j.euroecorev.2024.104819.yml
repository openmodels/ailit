Drivers of Risk:
  1: Region-specific temperature and damage functions, emissions impacting global
    and regional temperature
  2: Carbon emissions leading to increased atmospheric carbon concentration and mean
    global temperature.
  3: Region-specific temperatures impacting region-specific damages; Regional carbon
    end dates.
  4: Key drivers include the heavy use of fossil fuels in production and the lack
    of participation by major economies such as China in carbon policies.
  8: "The model includes a carbon tax (\U0001D70F\U0001D461) and considers the price\
    \ of dirty energy (\U0001D45D\U0001D440\U0001D461)."
  9: Emissions (including land-based emissions), radiative forcing (both exogenous
    and related to atmospheric carbon concentration), and global mean temperature
    change.
  10: Regional average surface temperatures (Tz,t) which deviate from an optimal temperature
    (T*). Both temperatures above and below T* reduce TFP. The paper also incorporates
    region-specific exogenous productivity trends, but these are not climate-related.

    temperature changes attributable to global warming.
  15: The magnitude of global damages is highly sensitive to the shape of the upper
    tail of the damage function, with higher damages leading to reduced emissions
    and temperature increases due to lower economic output.

Highlights:
  1: Climate change may dramatically reduce GDP in most regions, particularly India,
    Brazil, and the South Asian Pacific; carbon taxation and region- and generation-specific
    transfers can correct the carbon externality and raise welfare; uniform welfare
    gains require exceptionally high compensatory payments; limited burden redistribution
    policies can still deliver substantial welfare gains; carbon taxes alone may be
    insufficient without global adoption.
  2: Carbon taxation, coupled with interregional and intergenerational redistribution,
    can substantially limit climate change damage while making everyone better off.
    Some regions benefit from climate change without policy.
  3: Global carbon taxation can significantly mitigate losses from climate change,
    but atmospheric carbon concentration is already so high that the optimal UWI carbon
    tax policy can only limit peak global damages by 44.3 percent.
  4: Participation of major economies like China in carbon policy is crucial for making
    real progress against climate change; coal's supply curve and substitutability
    between energy forms affect policy adjustments.
  10: Some regions (cold regions) may initially benefit from global warming as their
    temperatures approach an optimal temperature (T*).
  11: The paper describes the 18 regions included in their model, lists the acronyms
    for each region, and presents a map showing the regions.
  12: Significant differences are noted in energy consumption and carbon emissions,
    with China having higher emissions relative to its GDP owing to its coal dependency.
  13: Table 4 presents regional productivity growth rates relative to the US, which
    are applied in the model until 2100.
  14: Key outcomes include significant economic damages for India, the US, China,
    and Japan in high-damage scenarios, and climate gains for regions like Russia
    and Canada under BAU conditions.
  15: One of the key highlights is that global peak GDP loss in the 6x case is close
    to 17%, a significant economic impact according to their model.
  16: Optimal initial carbon taxes are extremely sensitive to the damage function.
    UWI carbon policy can achieve major win-win for all humanity, even with large
    transfers from future generations.
  17: Optimal taxes can exceed $700 per ton, welfare gains from dynamic carbon tax
    growth are small, and starting high on carbon taxes results in steep emission
    reductions with minimal impact on long-term emission pathways.
  18: There are large welfare gains for many region-specific future generations, with
    future Indians experiencing significant gains.
  19: Carbon taxation dramatically limits the increase in global temperature, staying
    within or near the 2.0-degree limit set in the Paris Agreement. Carbon taxation
    can dramatically reduce regional climate damage, with reductions of almost 50
    percent for most regions.
  20: The figure presents how total CO2 emissions change over time under different
    policies.
  21: The analysis shows welfare gains as a function of years for different policies,
    with the x-axis referencing the year of birth for the 6x damage specification.
  22: Optimal carbon taxes are substantial and can lead to a marked reduction in fossil
    fuel consumption, yielding long-term benefits. Carbon taxes may require compensating
    current generations.
  23: Indians born in 200 years could face significant financial burdens under the
    UWI policy, transferring 40% of their consumption, with other regions also experiencing
    large future transfers.
  24: India, potentially most impacted by climate change, shows a significant potential
    difference in GDP share by 2100 with carbon policy intervention versus without,
    demonstrating the policy's significant effect on India's economic potential.
  26: The regional SCC is only significant in China and the US. A large regional tax
    has a relatively small impact on emissions and warming. Regional welfare gains
    from optimal regional taxes and transfers can be disappointing. Partial participation
    in emissions reduction is problematic.
  28: The page highlights that a compensatory carbon tax policy may achieve uniform
    welfare improvements globally, reducing peak temperature rise.
  29: Table 8 shows that China (CHI) has significantly higher energy consumption and
    CO2 emissions relative to its GDP compared to the US.
  30: Social cost of carbon estimates for the USA under various scenarios and time
    horizons are presented.
  33: The social cost of carbon varies significantly by region, emissions scenario,
    and time horizon. Global SCC rises significantly over time and with higher emissions
    scenarios. Developing regions (e.g., SSA, SLA, MENA) generally experience higher
    social costs of carbon than developed regions (e.g., GBR, ANZ).
  36: The paper analyzes the effect of different policies on coal consumption over
    time.
Methodology:
  1: Large-scale, annually calibrated, multi-region, overlapping generations model
    of climate change and carbon policy
  2: Large-scale, multi-region, overlapping generations (OLG) model with 18 regions
    and 80 overlapping generations. Uses dirty (oil, gas, coal) and clean energy to
    produce output. The model connects carbon emissions to atmospheric carbon concentration
    and global temperature. Focus is on a uniform welfare improving (UWI) carbon policy.
  3: Large-scale OLG integrated assessment model (IAM) with region-specific emissions
    and damages, region-specific temperatures based on ''pattern scaling''. Model
    determines region-specific temperatures based on pattern scaling, handles key
    feedbacks (between global and region-specific temperatures, region-specific temperatures
    on region-specific damages, region-specific damages on region-specific production,
    changing region-specific production on region-specific emissions, and the sum
    of regional emissions determining global emissions and, thus, global temperature).
  4: The analysis includes modeling coal reserves, energy substitutability, and assessing
    carbon taxation enacted by regional coalitions; it also considers various policies
    such as UWI, UWIF, and UWIL.
  6: Includes clean energy production with region- and time-specific productivity
    level and profit maximization constraints.
  7: The analysis accounts for finite energy reserves and increasing costs with extraction
    in dirty energy production.
  8: The paper uses equations to model dirty energy production, household behavior
    (consumption/savings choices, labor supply), and equilibrium conditions. The model
    considers agents from age 20 to 100, with age-specific mortality risks hedged
    via annuities.
  9: The climate evolution is modeled using a functional form based on DICE (Nordhaus,
    2017) but parameterized by Folini et al. (2024). It mimics the carbon cycle with
    three carbon reservoirs (atmosphere, upper ocean, lower ocean) and uses pattern
    scaling to infer regional temperatures from global temperatures.
  10: "Uses pattern scaling based on Lynch et al. (2017) with the CCSM4 model following\
    \ RCP8.5. Local temperatures are derived on a 1\xB0 by 1\xB0 grid and GDP-weighted\
    \ to produce regional average temperatures. Regional TFP is modeled as the product\
    \ of an exogenous trend and a temperature-dependent function (Eq. 43), peaking\
    \ at T*. The social cost of carbon (SCC) is calculated by comparing damages under\
    \ two emissions paths: one with an additional unit of CO2 and one without. The\
    \ solution method uses a variant of the Gauss-Seidel iteration technique. Assumes\
    \ the economy reaches a steady state in 3017. The algorithm is highly precise.\
    \ Its annual variables converge, relative to their prior guessed values, to less\
    \ than one-hundredth of one percent."
  11: The paper uses an 18-region overlapping generations (OLG) model, built upon
    the Global Gaidar Model (GGM) and extended by coupling it to a climate emulator
    and adding an extra region (splitting Canada/ANZ). The model is calibrated using
    data primarily from 2017. The elasticity of substitution between oil, coal, and
    gas is assumed to be 2.
  12: "The analysis includes region-specific GDP and energy consumption calculations\
    \ and uses parameters like \u03BA values to estimate dependence on energy types."
  13: "Country-specific regressions from M\xFCller et al. (2019) were aggregated to\
    \ generate regional productivity growth rates. These productivity growth rate\
    \ differentials are applied through 2100. After 2100, productivity growth in all\
    \ regions equals the assumed fixed 1.56 percent US growth rate."
  14: The analysis simulates business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios and different damage-function
    specifications to assess climate impacts under varying levels of assumed damages.
  15: The analysis uses a baseline business-as-usual (BAU) scenario focused on emissions
    and temperature changes, calibrated to the multi-model mean of CMIP5 simulations.
  16: Compares BAU scenario, DICE 2016, and RCP scenarios. Analysis involves carbon
    taxation and universal wealth inheritance (UWI) policies, including scenarios
    with and without transfers.
  17: The analysis evaluates different scenarios (No Transfers, UWI, UWIF, UWIL, and
    BAU) with varying degrees of climate damage multipliers (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x) and considers
    optimal carbon taxation and its growth over 50 years.
  19: The analysis uses different carbon tax policies (UWIL and UWIF) under a 6x damage
    specification to model emissions, temperature, and damage pathways. Results are
    also reported for a 4x damage case. The model appears to evaluate regional outcomes
    under different policy scenarios.
  20: The analysis examines CO2 emissions under a '6x damage specification' and different
    policy scenarios.
  21: The analysis considers different policies and uses 2017 as the base year (year
    0).
  22: The analysis considers optimal carbon taxes and their impact on consumption
    of fossil fuels and welfare of different generations (cohorts).
  28: The study uses a model accounting for carbon taxation and redistribution policies
    to evaluate welfare gains and climate impacts.
  29: The analysis uses a recursive solution algorithm to solve nonlinear systems
    of equations and iteratively finds the optimal carbon tax path.
  32: "The paper uses a Krusell\u2013Smith type model combined with an Auerbach and\
    \ Kotlikoff Lump-Sum Redistribution Authority (LSRA) to derive the largest UWI\
    \ carbon tax policy. It iteratively solves a system of equations considering factors\
    \ like oil, gas, and coal extraction, prices, Lagrange multipliers, regional productivity,\
    \ and resource supplies to determine the optimal global carbon tax rate path."
  33: The specific methodology used to calculate the social cost of carbon is not
    detailed on this page, but the table presents results for different emissions
    scenarios (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x) and socioeconomic pathways (BAU and UWI) from 2017
    to 2100.
  34: Iterative process involving guessing a carbon tax path, finding the LSRA solution,
    calculating the SCC path, updating the carbon tax path, and iterating until convergence.
  35: The analysis uses a '6x damage specification' to determine the relationship
    between policies and gas consumption over time.
More Notes:
  1: The model incorporates phased impact of emissions calibrated to the latest scientific
    evidence.
  2: 'The model includes three goods: output, clean energy, and dirty energy. Clean
    energy production is limited by a fixed factor proxying for regional limits on
    green-energy production. The model considers the welfare impacts of different
    carbon policies across regions and generations.'
  3: The optimal UWI gain is 4.3 percent, measured as a consumption compensating variation.
    Implementing UWI policy requires substantial inter-generational and inter-regional
    net transfers.
  4: The future of economic power, including the shift in GDP distribution towards
    China and the US, remains largely unchanged by climate policy.
  8: The model appears to be a general equilibrium model incorporating climate policy
    (carbon tax) and demographic projections to analyze economic outcomes.
  10: "The paper uses Nordhaus\u2019 G-Econ database to construct the GDP-weighted\
    \ regional temperature patterns. Calibration of damage functions is related to\
    \ global damage functions used in the literature via the parameter \U0001D710\
    +."
  11: The paper splits the original Canada, Australia, and New Zealand region in the
    GGM model into Canada and ANZ (Australia and New Zealand) as separate regions.
  12: No other specific notes extracted from this page; the focus is predominantly
    on energy consumption and emissions data.
  13: The calibration of productivity growth relies on external data and assumptions
    about long-term convergence.
  16: The model simplifies ownership of carbon reserves by assuming they are perfectly
    tradeable, acknowledging this is not necessarily empirically accurate.
  17: The analysis shows UWI tax policy option impacts welfare positively across regions
    but at high costs to low-income regions most vulnerable to climate change.
  18: All carbon taxes are lump-sum rebated to owners of dirty-energy companies, benefiting
    initial generations.
  19: The paper emphasizes the heterogeneous nature of climate damages across regions,
    with some regions experiencing negative impacts (e.g., Russia, Canada) and others
    facing significant losses (e.g., India). The quick substitution of clean energy
    for coal may seem unrealistic, but the paper claims such a substitution is arguably
    already underway in China and other regions, which are rapidly building nuclear
    power plants while shutting down coal plants.
  20: The term '6x damage specification' might be relevant contextually if this paper
    discusses damage functions of climate change and CO2 emission policies.

    of birth. Horizontal axis specifies the cohort year of birth.
  28: The page suggests that addressing climate change effectively involves feasible
    carbon taxes and transfer policies, with potential global benefits.
  30: The table format makes extracting specific data points tedious without further
    context on the scenarios (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x case) and policies (BAU, UWI).
  34: The x-axis represents years, with year 0 being 2017.
  35: The graph shows gas consumption as a function of years and different policies.
Quantitative Material:
  15: 'The analysis includes quantitative information on GDP losses as a percentage
    for different regions under multiples of damage scenarios: for example, the U.S.
    at 4.0% for 1x and 17.1% for 6x.'
Quantitative material:
  1: Welfare gains of 4.3 percent possible with carbon taxation and transfers; welfare
    gains of 4.0 percent or higher possible with a limited burden redistribution policy
    (less than 10 percent consumption-equivalent basis)
  2: "Without policy, climate change will reduce global output by 14% in 2100, but\
    \ with their optimal UWI carbon tax, this is limited to a 9% reduction. For India,\
    \ the end-of-century output decline is limited from 38.5% to 26.2%. For the U.S.,\
    \ the reduction in 2100 GDP is 13.9% without the UWI policy and 8.0% with it.\
    \ China\u2019s respective values are 13.7% without policy and 7.8% with policy.\
    \ For Canada, climate change will raise GDP in 2100 by 2.5%, but the UWI policy\
    \ reduces Canada\u2019s 2100 GDP by 0.6% relative to its no climate-change level."
  3: "Under a high-damage baseline scenario, the increase in the planet\u2019s mean\
    \ surface temperature through 2100, absent policy, is approximately 3.1 degrees\
    \ Celsius; Climate change lowers India, the South Asian Pacific, Sub-Saharan Africa,\
    \ the Middle East and North Africa's 2100 GDP levels by 38.6, 33.4, 33.0, and\
    \ 30.9 percent, respectively; Global GDP's 2100 value is reduced by 14.7 percent;\
    \ Optimal UWI policy ends all dirty energy usage by 2103 and dramatically reduces\
    \ cumulative (2017 through fossil fuel\u2019s end date) oil, gas, and coal consumption\
    \ by 84.4 percent, 86.2 percent, and 98.1 percent, respectively; These major impacts\
    \ limit the rise in the global mean surface temperature to 2.1 degrees Celsius;\
    \ The peak global GDP loss declines from 16.7 percent to 9.3 percent; Peak regional\
    \ damages now range from 0.5 percent to 27.8 percent of GDP compared with the\
    \ range from 2.1 percent to 43.9 under BAU."
  4: Quantifies net taxes as a percentage of lifetime consumption with impacts varying
    from 15% to 40% depending on the region; the delay in policy initiation reduces
    the welfare gain by 35%.
  10: Damage function D_z,t = 1 - Z_z,t / Z_z,1900, where Z_z,t is regional TFP.
  11: The model uses 2017 GDP values from the World Bank's Development Indicators
    to calibrate regional TFP levels. The model uses energy consumption data from
    the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) to calibrate region-specific CES
    production functions, considering coal, natural gas, petroleum, nuclear, and renewables.
    The model uses 2017 world energy prices, specifically the $50.8 price per barrel
    of West Texas Intermediate crude, to measure share parameters.
  12: Chinese fossil fuel consumption is 122.14 quad Btus, US consumption is 80.01
    quad Btus, and WEU consumption is 49.26 quad Btus; China's carbon emissions are
    twice that of the US and three times that of WEU.
  13: Presents productivity rates relative to the US productivity growth rate in Table
    4. Example values include -0.11% for ANZ, 0.27% for BRA, -0.08% for CND, and so
    on.
  14: Quantitative information is provided, including projected global mean temperature
    increases of 3.7 to 4.4 degrees Celsius, peak global damages of 17% of world output,
    and region-specific economic impacts such as over 40% GDP losses for India by
    2200 in the 6x damage scenario.
  16: Initial optimal carbon taxes range from $22.8 to $111.7 per ton CO2 with different
    damage calibrations. UWI carbon policy can achieve welfare gains of 4.3 percent
    in the 6x UWI case. Some generations incur welfare losses up to 18.0 percent in
    the 6x case, while others experience gains up to 47.6 percent.
  17: Quantitative data includes optimal carbon tax rates, welfare gains in percentage,
    maximal global temperature rise in degrees Celsius, maximal global and regional
    damages in percentage of GDP, and long-run interest rate changes.
  18: The page mentions a uniform 4.3 percent UWI gain and a slightly lower 4.0 percent
    gain under UWIL policy for specific regions.
  19: Reductions in emissions, temperature, and economic damages are quantified. For
    example, in ANZ, maximal damages drop from 20 percent to just above 10 percent,
    and the US damages drop from above 16 percent to around 8 percent of GDP.
  20: The y-axis represents total CO2 emissions in GtCO2, and the x-axis represents
    years, with year 0 being 2017.
  21: Welfare gains are measured as compensating consumption differentials in percentages
    as a function of years.
  22: "Figure 8 shows regional temperature (y-axis) in the 6x case (measured in \u25E6\
    C) as a function of years (x-axis, year 0 is 2017) and different policies."
  23: Discusses the UWI policy, indicating that future generations in certain regions
    like India may need to transfer around 40% of their consumption, while regions
    like BRA, SAP, MENA, SLA, and SSA may need to transfer more than 20%.
  24: Table 7 provides quantitative data on the regional GDP as a share of world GDP
    under the 6x damage scenario for different regions from 2017 to 2150, under both
    BAU and Optimal carbon tax policies.
  26: The 2017 SCC for India is $10.58, and for Brazil, only $3.12. The global SCC,
    in this case, is $111.69 (all values in USD).
  28: There are peak GDP loss estimates, such as a 43.9% loss for India and 17.1%
    for the US under a high damage scenario.
