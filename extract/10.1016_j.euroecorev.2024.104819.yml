Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, phased impact of emissions on global and regional temperature.
  2: Anthropogenic climate change, carbon emissions leading to increased atmospheric
    carbon concentration and mean global temperature.
  3: Carbon emissions, global temperature increase, region-specific temperature changes,
    damage from climate change, technological advances in clean energy, dependence
    on dirty energy.
  4: Delays in carbon taxation can undermine its effectiveness due to the 'use it
    or lose it' strategy of fossil fuel producers.
  5: Rise in global temperature leading to reductions in Total Factor Productivity
    (TFP).
  6: Region-specific total factor productivity (TFP) (A), climate change via impact
    on TFP (implied), region-specific production parameters.
  7: Fossil fuel prices (oil, gas, coal), climate policy (carbon taxation), dirty
    energy substitutability.
  8: "The model includes carbon taxes (\U0001D70F\U0001D461), lump-sum rebates (\uE240\
    \U0001D440\U0001D461), and idiosyncratic mortality risk."
  9: Emissions from production (implicitly through the net tax T imposed by the IMF),
    land-based carbon emissions, and exogenous radiative forcing.
  10: Regional average surface temperatures, CO2 emissions, deviations from optimal
    temperature (T*).
  11: No relevant information
  12: Dependence on different energy sources (coal, natural gas, petroleum, renewables);
    dirty-energy share parameters; region-specific energy consumption.
  14: Global mean temperature increases, region-specific temperature changes, damage
    functions (low, medium, high)
  15: Different climate damage scenarios (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x representing different magnitudes
    of damage for a given temperature increase) and resulting temperature increases;
    reliance on damage function shapes.
  16: Carbon policies (carbon taxes and UWI policies), damage function calibration
    (1x to 6x)
  17: Damage case (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x representing different levels of climate change
    damage), different transfer schemes (No Transfers, UWI, UWIF, UWIL) influencing
    how the costs and benefits of carbon taxation are distributed.
  18: The text discusses policies related to green energy and potentially carbon taxes,
    which are relevant to climate change adaptation.
  19: Climate change (temperature rise).
  20: Total CO2 emissions, different policies (unspecified)
  23: Climate change, specifically in the absence of mitigation
  24: Climate change, carbon policy (or lack thereof), infinite vs. finite coal reserves,
    substitutability between green and dirty energy, sovereign debt sustainability.
  25: Infinite coal reserves and the substitutability of clean for dirty energy are
    key drivers of risk influencing carbon damages and policy effectiveness.
  26: 6x damage scenario (likely a scenario where climate change impacts are amplified
    sixfold compared to a baseline scenario); Partial participation in emissions reduction
    efforts.
  27: Carbon taxation policies (level, timing, and regional coverage); Climate Change
    (damage specification scenarios - 1x, 2x, 4x, 6x damage); 'Green Paradox' effects
    related to anticipatory fossil fuel extraction and carbon leakage.
  28: Climate change driven by fossil fuel usage; global carbon tax; region and generation-specific
    transfers.
  29: BAU damages resulting from our 1x damage specification of the damage function
  30: Different climate change scenarios (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x) representing multiples of
    pre-industrial CO2 levels, and different assumptions about 'UWI' (Uncertainty-Weighted
    Impacts) which captures uncertainty around climate sensitivity and damage functions.
    Time horizon (2017, 2025, 2050, 2100).
  31: No relevant information
  32: Extraction of oil, gas, and coal; Regional productivity in final output and
    clean energy production.
  34: Different policies (presumably related to climate change mitigation)
  37: Climate change (global warming), rainfall risk, hurricanes, flood risk, ageing
    populations, exhaustible resources, technological uncertainty
Highlights:
  1: "Region-specific temperature and damage functions with the phased impact of emissions\
    \ on global and regional temperature calibrated to the latest scientific evidence;\
    \ carbon taxes set through time, at carbon\u2019s marginal social cost, do far\
    \ too little to mitigate climate change unless all major emitters, particularly\
    \ China, adopt them and do so immediately."
  2: A uniform welfare improving (UWI) carbon tax, coupled with interregional and
    intergenerational redistribution, can substantially limit climate change damages
    and make everyone better off. Climate change will materially undermine economic
    growth, but do so differentially by region.
  3: Global carbon taxation can significantly mitigate losses from climate change;
    Atmospheric carbon concentration is already so high that the optimal UWI carbon
    tax policy can only limit peak global damages by 44.3%; The UWI policy is equivalent
    to increasing the annual consumption of each cohort by 4.3% under BAU.
  4: China's participation in carbon policy is critical for meaningful progress against
    climate change; GDP shares of China and the US change places by century's end
    despite climate policies.
  5: Labor-productivity catch-up growth is the dominant growth driver, even with major
    climate damage, outpacing the negative impacts of climate change on GDP.
  6: The paper models region-specific production functions for final output and clean
    energy, incorporating capital, labor, and energy (clean and dirty) as inputs.
  7: The speed of transition to full substitutability between clean and dirty energy
    has little impact on the optimal paths of carbon taxation and UWI welfare gains,
    although short- and medium-term use of dirty energy, particularly coal, is greater
    the slower the transition.
  10: Regional TFP is modeled as peaking at an optimal temperature (T*), with both
    warming and cooling relative to T* causing productivity losses. Defines SCC as
    the present discounted value of future damages from an additional unit of CO2
    emitted.
  11: 'The model divides the world into 18 regions, listed in Table 1, for macroeconomic
    analysis. Energy consumption data is aggregated into four composites: coal, gas,
    oil, and clean energy.'
  12: China's carbon emissions are twice that of the US and three times that of WEU,
    reflecting its dependence on coal. The US emissions are three-fifths larger than
    WEU's, despite a smaller GDP difference.
  14: Absent carbon policy, global mean temperature will rise significantly; damages
    can be extraordinarily large for specific regions (e.g., India); some regions
    (Russia, Canada) may experience gains from warming.
  15: Global peak GDP loss in the 6x case is close to 17%; damages are highly sensitive
    to the damage function shape; some regions (RUS, CND) may experience gains under
    certain scenarios.
  16: Optimal initial carbon taxes are extremely sensitive to the damage function;
    UWI carbon policy can achieve a major win-win for all humanity; UWI policy entails
    extremely large transfers from future generations in regions hardest hit by climate
    change.
  17: Optimal carbon taxes are very high in the long run, welfare gains from time-varying
    tax growth rates are small, UWI (uniform welfare improvement) comes at a high
    net tax cost to vulnerable regions, UWIL (UWI with limits on net taxes) can provide
    higher welfare gains for future generations in these regions.
  18: There are large welfare gains for many region-specific future generations from
    UWIL policy.
  19: Carbon taxation can dramatically reduce regional climate damage, in some cases
    by almost 50 percent.
  20: The analysis shows how different policies impact total CO2 emissions over time.
  21: The figure shows welfare gains over time (years) under different policies, with
    the base year being 2017.
  23: Under the UWI policy, regions like India, which are highly vulnerable to climate
    change, would be required to make significant net transfers, potentially exceeding
    40% of future generations' consumption, to service carbon-policy debt.
  24: China is projected to eclipse the US economically with or without a carbon policy.
    India stands to lose the most from climate change, but carbon policy can significantly
    impact its share of global GDP. The US's economic hegemony declines regardless
    of carbon policy.
  25: Infinite coal reserves increase the gains from climate policy, while imperfect
    substitutability between clean and dirty energy sources reduces them; slower substitutability
    results in higher dirty energy usage and larger carbon damages.
  26: Regional SCC can be significantly lower than the global SCC, even in regions
    projected to experience large damages, suggesting that the benefits of regional
    climate action may be limited by partial participation. The SCC is only significant
    in China and the US.
  27: Carbon taxation needs to be global to be effective due to general equilibrium
    effects and carbon leakage; Delaying carbon taxation reduces UWI gains and increases
    emissions; The impact of a delayed carbon tax by China depends on the severity
    of climate change damages.
  28: Absent policy, climate change produces substantial regional GDP losses, particularly
    in India. A compensatory carbon tax policy (UWI, UWIF, UWIL) can achieve welfare
    gains for all cohorts and reduce climate damage. The redistributive aspect of
    UWI policy might be unenforceable due to high taxes on future cohorts.
  29: Clearly, the SCC is high for regions with high total GDP, notably CHI and USA.
    Note that in the optimal cases, the tax on carbon equals the SCC.
  30: The social cost of carbon varies significantly across regions and is highly
    sensitive to the climate change scenario and time horizon. The SCC generally increases
    over time and with higher climate change scenarios (higher multiples of pre-industrial
    CO2). Some regions (RUS, CND, EEU) even show negative SCC values.

  32: The study determines the largest UWI carbon tax policy that achieves uniform
    welfare gains.
  35: No relevant information
  37: Several papers focus on intergenerational equity and the distribution of costs
    and benefits related to environmental policy and climate change. Studies examine
    climate-induced migration and its impact on local economies, as well as the economic

Methodology:
  1: Large-scale, annually calibrated, multi-region, overlapping generations model
    of climate change and carbon policy.
  2: Large-scale, multi-region, overlapping generations (OLG) model with 18 regions
    and 80 generations. The model includes capital, labor, clean energy, and dirty
    energy to produce output. Regions are calibrated to UN demographic data. The model
    calculates a uniform welfare improving (UWI) carbon tax policy.
  3: Large-scale overlapping generations (OLG) integrated assessment model (IAM) with
    region-specific emissions and damages; Pattern scaling to determine region-specific
    temperatures; Calibration of damage function based on Krusell and Smith (2022),
    approximating aggregated damages to the DICE 2016 model (Nordhaus, 2017); Using
    Folini et al.(2024) to recalibrate DICE functions governing relationships between
    global emissions, carbon concentration, and global mean temperature; Studying
    UWI, UWIF, and UWIL policies (Universal Welfare Increase, Future Only, Limited).
  4: The analysis considers various policy scenarios, including universal welfare
    involving future generations (UWIF) and transitions to clean energy assumptions;
    regions' ability to address climate change individually is assessed.
  5: Overlapping Generations (OLG) models are used to analyze climate change impacts
    and policy interventions, building on previous work integrating resource extraction,
    global warming, and economic efficiency.
  6: Develops a dynamic economic model with region-specific representative firms and
    households, focusing on Pareto efficiency. Model uses competitive equilibrium
    assumptions.
  7: Computable general equilibrium model with CES production function for dirty energy,
    cost minimization, and finite energy reserves. The model considers different speeds
    of transition towards perfect substitutability between clean and dirty energy.
  8: The model is a general equilibrium model with overlapping generations (OLG).
    Agents maximize utility subject to budget constraints and mortality risk. The
    model incorporates dirty energy production, land usage, and carbon policy. The
    results are applicable when studying the economic impacts of carbon policies and
    climate change adaptation strategies, considering the interplay between energy
    production, household behavior, and government debt.
  9: The analysis uses a multi-region overlapping generations (OLG) model. It incorporates
    a climate model based on DICE (Nordhaus, 2017) and uses parameterization from
    Folini et al. (2024). Regional temperatures are derived from global temperatures
    using "pattern scaling".
  10: Uses pattern scaling from Lynch et al. (2017) and CCSM4 model for RCP8.5. Computes
    regional GDP-weighted average temperatures. Models regional TFP as a product of
    an exogenous trend and a temperature-dependent function, following Krusell and
    Smith (2022). Calculates the SCC by comparing damages from different emissions
    paths. Solves the model using a variant of the Gauss-Seidel iteration technique.
  11: "An 18-region OLG (Overlapping Generations) model is used, building on the Global\
    \ Gaidar Model (GGM) and coupling it to a climate emulator. The model uses data\
    \ from the World Bank\u2019s Development Indicators (WDI) and the US Energy Information\
    \ Administration (EIA)."
  12: "The ratio of total energy consumption to GDP is used as a measure of 1 \u2212\
    \ \U0001D6FC\U0001D467\u2212 \U0001D6FD\U0001D467. The authors assume one-third\
    \ of the remaining output share is paid to capital, and the rest to labor. Clean-energy\
    \ production parameters are adopted from Kotlikoff et al. (2021). Region-specific\
    \ dirty-energy share parameters are normalized to sum to one and used to construct\
    \ the price of the dirty-energy composite."

    (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x) under a BAU scenario (no carbon policy).
  15: A climate emulator is calibrated according to the multi-model mean of CMIP5
    simulations; BAU scenario projections compared to IPCC RCP scenarios and DICE
    model.
  16: Analysis using a model with different damage function specifications (1x to
    6x) and carbon policy scenarios (no transfers, UWI, UWIF, UWIL).
  17: The analysis uses simulations to model the effects of different carbon tax policies
    and transfer schemes under varying climate damage scenarios. The model considers
    overlapping generations (OLG). Results are applicable for assessing long-term
    macroeconomic impacts of climate policy.
  18: The methodology involves modeling and simulating the impact of different policies
    (UWIL). The results seem to be applicable to region-specific future generations.
  19: The analysis uses a model to simulate the effects of carbon taxes under different
    scenarios (UWIL and UWIF) and damage specifications (6x and 4x).
  20: Model-based analysis, unspecified damage specification (6x), comparing different
    (unspecified) policies
  21: The analysis calculates welfare gains as a function of years and different policies.
    The '6x damage specification' is used.
  23: The analysis uses a '6x damage specification' and models the impact of different
    policies (including UWI). The results appear to be applicable at a regional level
    (India, BRA, SAP, MENA, SLA, SSA, US).
  24: Simulation model to project GDP shares under different scenarios (BAU vs. Optimal
    carbon policy). Analysis considers the impact of carbon policy on the evolution
    of global economic power. Also looks at sensitivity analysis with infinite coal
    reserves. Considers the political sustainability of carbon policies.
  25: Analysis considers different scenarios with varying coal supply assumptions
    and the substitutability of clean energy, using models to determine optimal tax
    trajectories under these conditions.
  26: The analysis uses regional SCC calculations to assess the impact of emissions
    and climate damage.
  27: Computable General Equilibrium model; Analysis of coalitions and individual
    regions implementing carbon taxes under different assumptions about damages from

  28: The study uses a model to simulate the effects of climate change under BAU and
    various carbon tax policies (UWI, UWIF, UWIL) with region- and generation-specific
    transfers. The model considers the substitutability of clean and dirty energy
    over a nine-decade technology transformation.
  29: recursively solves a series of simple one-period problems

    general equilibrium models, cohort analysis, energy-balance model, economic geography

More Notes:
  1: The model features region-specific temperature and damage functions.
  2: The paper emphasizes the importance of regional disaggregation to accurately
    calculate the optimal UWI global carbon tax due to non-linearities in climate
    damages, different fossil fuel usage, and differing impacts on GDP across regions.
  3: The model considers feedback loops between temperature, damages, production,
    and emissions; The UWI policy includes a carbon tax and lump-sum redistribution
    to ensure equal welfare gains across generations and regions.
  4: The analysis suggests that while carbon taxation is beneficial, the actual distribution
    of economic power remains largely unchanged with or without it.
  5: The literature review highlights various approaches to modeling climate change,
    including Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) and the consideration of regional
    heterogeneities and the impact of carbon taxes and transfer policies.
  6: The model focuses on the production side of the economy. It incorporates clean
    and dirty energy, which is critical for climate change analysis. The model allows
    for capital mobility via a world interest rate. The model features region-specific
    technologies.
  7: The model incorporates the constraint that dirty energy consumption is non-negative
    and the cost of extracting dirty energy increases as reserves decline.
  9: 'The model includes a hypothetical international institution (IMF) to coordinate
    global carbon policy through net taxes on carbon generation. The model considers
    three carbon reservoirs: the atmosphere, the upper ocean, and the lower ocean.
    The model does not explicitly mention adaptation measures.'
  10: The model incorporates the possibility that some regions might initially benefit
    from climate change (cold regions warming towards T*). The study uses a certainty-equivalent
    approach. The model considers a millennium time horizon for stabilization.
  11: The model focuses on calibrating production functions based on energy consumption
    data. The paper refers to other sections (3.4 and Appendix A.1) for details on
    the climate emulator and calibration strategy, respectively.
  12: Table 8 in the Appendix shows region-specific GDP, energy consumption, and CO2
    emissions relative to the USA.
  13: The analysis incorporates assumptions about energy prices, extraction costs,
    and climate model parameters from DICE and other studies.
  14: Lower damages can mean higher GDP and, thus, higher emissions; the model uses
    'Krusell-Smith' type productivity functions dependent on temperature; the analysis
    focuses on the next 200 years.
  15: BAU scenario emissions are lower than in DICE or RCP8.5, falling between RCP6.0
    and RCP4.5. China and India are projected to account for almost 40% of world GDP
    by 2100 regardless of climate policy. Global interest rates fall to 2.9% by the
    end of the century from 4.0% under BAU due to demographic changes and faster growth
    in high-saving regions.
  16: The analysis considers the impact of net transfers on the SCC and interest rates.
    The ownership of reserves is assumed tradeable.
  17: The level of climate change damage (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x) significantly impacts all
    outcomes. The choice of transfer scheme (No Transfers, UWI, UWIF, UWIL) greatly
    influences the distribution of welfare gains and losses across regions and generations.
    Regional transfers impact the optimal carbon taxation strategy.
  18: Carbon taxes are lump-sum rebated to the dirty-energy companies, i.e., to their
    owners, namely initial generations.
  19: The analysis suggests that the reduction in emissions is substantial and essentially
    identical whether or not the policy incorporates the sharing of net welfare gains
    across region-specific generations. The rise in global temperature stays within
    or near the 2.0-degree limit set in the Paris Agreement with carbon taxation.
  21: The x-axis also references the year of birth, possibly indicating how the impact
    varies for different generations.
  23: The analysis questions the fairness of the UWI policy, suggesting that poorer
    regions may disproportionately bear the burden of climate change mitigation despite
    contributing less to the problem. 'Year 0' is 2017.
  24: The analysis considers the potential for sovereign debt defaults due to the
    large transfers required by some carbon policies. It also examines the impact
    of different assumptions about coal reserves and the substitutability of energy
    sources. UWIL policy, with a 10 percent net tax cap, is almost uniformly welfare-improving
    and has a greater chance of political support.
  25: Study highlights the potential of gradual transition and technological improvement,
    such as carbon capture, to enhance substitutability and mitigate climate impact.
  27: The 'Green Paradox' suggests that announcing carbon taxes in advance can worsen
    climate change by encouraging faster fossil fuel extraction; The model accounts
    for costly dirty-energy extraction.
  28: The study acknowledges a time consistency problem with high taxes on future
    generations. Different policy scenarios (UWI, UWIF, UWIL) are explored to address
    this issue.
  29: The study utilizes a computational model with detailed steps outlined in section
    A.3. It compares its damage predictions with DICE (Nordhaus, 2017). It models
    the effects of carbon taxes on coal, oil, and gas usage. Regions are modeled as
    ANZ, BRA, CND, CHI, EEU, GBR, IND, JSHK, MENA, MEX, RUS, SAF, SAP, SLA, SOV, SSA,
    US, WEU.
  30: WEU = Western Europe, JSHK = Japan, South Korea, CHI = China, IND = India, RUS
    = Russia, CND = Canada, EEU = Eastern Europe, SAP = South Africa and Peripheral
    countries.
  31: The page describes a figure showing population projections by age group over
    time, but does not explain how this data relates to macroeconomic/fiscal risks
    of climate change or adaptation.
  32: The model considers the impact of a carbon tax combined with lump-sum redistribution
    on various economic variables.
  35: The page focuses solely on gas consumption and its response to different policies
    under a specific climate change damage scenario. It does not directly address
    broader macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, nor does it discuss the costs
    and benefits of adaptation.
  37: Many papers use modeling techniques (dynamic fiscal policy, overlapping generations)
    to assess the long-term macroeconomic and fiscal implications of climate change
    and related policies. Several authors (Kotlikoff, Hassler, Krusell) appear frequently,
    suggesting a focus on overlapping areas of research.

Quantitative material:
  1: Carbon taxation, coupled with region- and generation-specific transfers, can
    both correct the carbon externality and raise the welfare of all current and future
    agents across all regions by 4.3 percent; a carbon tax-cum redistribution policy
    that limits the burden for any generation in any region to less than 10 percent
    can deliver a 4.0 percent or higher welfare gain.

    \ raise GDP in 2100 by 2.5%; the UWI policy reduces Canada\u2019s 2100 GDP by\
    \ 0.6% relative to its no climate-change level. Initial carbon tax of $87.5 rising\
    \ annually at 1.4 percent."
  3: Under BAU, global GDP in 2100 is reduced by 14.7% due to climate change; Some
    regions see GDP declines of up to 38.6%; UWI policy limits global mean surface
    temperature increase to 2.1 degrees Celsius; Peak global GDP loss declines from
    16.7% to 9.3% under UWI; Optimal UWI gain is 4.3% (consumption compensating variation).
  4: Indian generations born after the year 2200 face net negative transfers equivalent
    to roughly 40% of lifetime consumption; without China's participation, regional
    uniform welfare gains are about 60% lower.
  5: The U.S. and China have similar initial climates and, thus, experience, through
    time, very similar proportionate GDP declines due to the rise in global temperature.

  13: Productivity growth rates for non-US regions relative to the US are provided,
    e.g., CHI at 2.54%, IND at 1.99%.
  14: "Global mean temperature will rise by 3.7 to 4.4 degrees Celsius over the next\
    \ 200 years; global damages peak at almost 17 percent of world output in the 6x\
    \ damage scenario; India\u2019s damages reach over 40 percent of GDP by 2200 in\
    \ the 6x damage scenario; US, China, and Japan/South Korea/Hong Kong damages exceed\
    \ 16 percent of output by 2200 in the 6x damage scenario; GBR experiences damages\
    \ peaking at 2.1 percent of GDP; Russia and Canada's climate gains peak above\
    \ 3.9 percent and 2.6 percent of GDP, respectively."
  15: Table 5 provides peak GDP losses/gains as a percentage of GDP for various regions
    (US, WEU, JSHK, CHI, IND, RUS, CND, EEU, SAP, BRA, MEX, SAF, MENA, SLA, SSA, SOV,
    GBR, ANZ, GLOBAL) under 1x, 2x, 4x, and 6x damage scenarios, as well as maximum
    global temperature rise for each scenario.
  16: Initial optimal carbon taxes ranging from $22.8 to $111.7 per ton CO2; UWI taxes
    ranging from $22.4 to $87.5; welfare gains up to 4.3 percent with 6x UWI; Welfare
    losses up to 18% without transfers; Welfare gains up to 47.6% without transfers;
    interest rate increase of 100 basis points under 6x UWI; minimal regional transfers
    up to 40% of consumption for Indians born in 200 years under 6x UWI

    transfer schemes, including initial optimal tax, average growth rate of optimal
    tax, welfare gains, maximum global temperature rise, maximum global damages, maximum
    regional damages, long-run interest rate, and minimal regional transfers.

    \ red line is slightly lower \u2013 4.0 percent \u2013 under UWIL policy for generations\
    \ in regions that do not exceed the limit."
  19: Maximal damages drop from 20 percent to just above 10 percent in ANZ with carbon
    taxation; US damages drop from above 16 percent to around 8 percent of GDP with
    carbon taxation.
  20: Total CO2 emissions (GtCO2) as a function of years (starting 2017)
  21: Welfare gains are quantified as percentages (compensating consumption differentials).
  23: Indians born in 200 years would be required to surrender around 40 percent of
    their consumption to help service outstanding carbon-policy debt under the UWI
    policy. Other regions (BRA, SAP, MENA, SLA, and SSA) require future generations
    to transfer more than 20 percent of their consumption.

    at 17.1%; Russia and Canada see gains of 3.9% and 2.6% respectively; optimal UWI
    gain is 4.3% consumption equivalent; UWIF policy provides 7.7% welfare gain to
    future generations; UWIL carbon tax starts at $91.4 per ton of CO2, rising at
    1.5% per year; peak temperature rise under UWIL is 2.1 degrees Celsius; peak global
