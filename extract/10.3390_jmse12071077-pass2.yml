Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Climate change amplifying drivers of coastal erosion, rising sea levels, altered\
    \ wave patterns, extreme events, El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a events."
  2: "Climate change amplifying El Ni\xF1o impacts, local sea-level rise, changes\
    \ in the intensity and frequency of extreme events, oceanic-atmospheric variations\
    \ (e.g., sea surface temperature, wave magnitude, storm intensity), geomorphological\
    \ and bathymetric characteristics, and human activities impacting the coastal\
    \ landscape."
  11: Rising sea surface temperatures increase tropical and extratropical storms,
    leading to more extreme wave events. Cyclone speed, direction, and scale, as well
    as friction with the seabed and coastal shape, affect coastal flooding potential.
    Changes in the seabed and human interventions along the coast can alter wave angles.
  20: Rising sea levels, extreme storms, increased intensity and frequency of tropical
    cyclones.
  21: Extreme events; Sea-level rise; Erosion rates; Hurricane impacts; Tectonic movements
    affecting coastline position; Cumulative effect of extreme climatic events altering
    hydrodynamic conditions; Urban development in vulnerable coastal areas.
  26: Climate change, internal climate variability (ENSO, SAM, AMO, PDO cycles), human
    activities (urbanization, construction of coastal protection/infrastructure, sand
    extraction), oceanic-atmospheric variations, changes in coastal currents and sediment
    distribution.
Highlights:
  1: "Coastal erosion is a growing challenge for Latin American coastal communities\
    \ driven by natural forces and climate change, causing significant economic losses\
    \ and endangering coastal populations. Projections indicate a rise in the population\
    \ inhabiting Low Elevation Coastal Zones (LECZ) by the century\u2019s end, emphasizing\
    \ the urgent need for effective management and planning."
  2: Oceanic-atmospheric variations influence coastal erosion, impacting vulnerable
    communities, and necessitating relocation due to sea-level rise and more powerful
    storms.
  11: No relevant information
  20: Coastal erosion leads to economic losses in tourism in Chile, with potential
    disappearance of some beaches by the end of the century.
  21: Extreme events and sea-level rise will negatively affect socio-economic activities
    in coastal areas, especially recreation sun and beach tourism in the Caribbean.
  26: Scarcity of data on oceanic-atmospheric variations on regional coastal climate
    in continental Latin America hinders understanding and projection of coastal erosion;
    Ineffective long-term mitigation and adaptation measures can exacerbate coastal
    erosion on sandy shores.
Methodology:
  1: Systematic review of 130 research papers analyzing historical trends and projections
    of oceanic-atmospheric variations and coastal erosion in continental Latin America.
  11: No relevant information
  20: Simulations projected for the year 2030 show average shoreline retreats of 3.60
    m for the RCP2.6 scenario, increasing to 42.80 m for RCP8.5 in Rio Grande do Sul,
    Brazil; A retreat of 2.00m to 13.00m is projected by 2050, and one of 10.00 m
    to 53.00 m by 2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario in Chile.
  21: Not applicable.
  26: In-situ studies of beachline variation and changes in coastal profile in regions
    where both are studied; the paper emphasizes a need for further research that
    addresses both physical impacts on coastal morphology and potential socio-economic
    impacts on populations.
More Notes:
  2: The review will address trends of oceanic-atmospheric variations for a high-emission
    scenario, and discuss the need for greater participation of at-risk coastal communities.
  11: The provided text focuses on the drivers of coastal flooding and erosion, particularly
    extreme weather events and sea-level rise, but does not quantify the macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes, or the costs and benefits of adaptation at a national level.
    The population data is referenced from another study.
  20: The impact of sea-level rise on shoreline retreat is dependent on the rate of
    sea-level rise and coastal topography.
  21: Mentions the importance of considering local sea-level rise, regional trends,
    tectonic movements, and cumulative effects of extreme climatic events in coastal
    impact estimations.
  26: The paper highlights the need for community participation and appropriate risk
    adaptation and mitigation strategies in coastal management policies; also emphasizes
    the importance of considering socio-economic aspects to formulate effective coastal
    management solutions.
