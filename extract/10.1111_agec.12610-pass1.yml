Drivers of Risk:
  1: Floods
  2: Floods becoming more frequent and devastating due to rising temperatures changing
    rainfall patterns and increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather;
    climate-change-related flooding caused by heavy rainfall over a short period and
    rapid melting of snow and ice in highland areas during the spring in Afghanistan.
  3: Increased climate change-related flooding in South Asia
  6: Exposure to a flood in the year before interview is the driver of risk; Experiences
    of insecurity or violence and unusually high increases in food prices may also
    be correlated.
  9: Flood, Violence, Price shock.
  11: Floods (negative impact of floods in the past year).
  13: Floods and price shocks
  16: Flooding
Highlights:
  1: Floods have a serious direct impact on both diet and effective behavioral responses
    to such shocks, impair livelihoods (rather than price hikes are the primary driver),
    and experience of floods is strongly and significantly associated with lower diet
    quality and quantity, and with engaging in consumption smoothing coping strategies,
    such as buying food on credit and taking loans.
  2: Flood exposure decreases household calorie consumption only slightly but significantly
    increases the probability of deficiencies in key micronutrients (iron, vitamin
    A, and vitamin C).
  3: Over a fifth of Afghans were negatively affected by floods within a 12-month
    period between 2011 and 2012, based on the NRVA data.
  9: Flood affected areas have significantly lower food security outcomes (e.g., lower
    Kcal/pc, Iron/pc, Vit. A/pc, Vit. C/pc) and higher deficiencies (Kcal deficiency,
    Iron deficiency, Vit. A deficiency, Vit. C deficiency), along with more widespread
    adoption of coping strategies (food on credit, loans, sold assets, reduced quality,
    skipped meals).
  10: Flood exposure significantly decreases Kcal consumption.
  11: Floods increase the likelihood of poverty and decrease per capita yearly income
    in Afghanistan.
  13: Floods and price shocks significantly increase poverty. Floods significantly
    decrease income. The 2SLS estimates are generally consistent with OLS estimates,
    suggesting the 2SLS strategy is appropriate.
  16: The true effect of flooding would be even more severe
Methodology:
  1: Instrumental variable approach to data from the Afghanistan National Risk and
    Vulnerability Assessment survey
  2: Applies a two stage least squares (2SLS) approach to microdata from the 2011/2012
    Afghanistan National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) cross-sectional
    survey to assess the effect of floods on food security in Afghanistan.
  3: Descriptive analysis of the NRVA data to assess the impact of floods on food
    security in Afghanistan between 2011 and 2012.
  6: The study uses OLS and 2SLS regression models to estimate the impact of floods
    on food security, poverty, and income.
  9: Compares means and standard deviations of various food security indicators and
    socioeconomic factors between flood-affected and non-flood-affected groups. Includes
    tests of significance (***, **) for differences in means.
  10: 2SLS regressions using NRVA 2011-12 data, with deficiency defined as kcal<2,100.
    All regressions control for household characteristics, topography, and province
    fixed effects and are estimated using sampling survey weights. Standard errors
    are clustered at the district level.
  11: 2SLS regressions using NRVA 2011-12 data, controlling for household characteristics,
    topography, and province fixed effects, with standard errors clustered at the
    district level. Poverty is calculated using a cost of basic needs approach.
  13: 2SLS regression using NRVA 2011-12 data for Afghanistan. Household controls,
    topography fixed effects, and province fixed effects are included. Standard errors
    are clustered at the district level.
  16: Microlevel empirical analysis is needed to uncover the dynamics between risk
    exposure and adaptation to or coping with climate change outcomes.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on Afghanistan and the impact of floods on household-level
    outcomes, specifically food security and income.
  2: The analysis focuses on the impact of floods on household food security, specifically
    calorie and micronutrient consumption in Afghanistan.
  3: The paper focuses on the flood-food security nexus and its long-term effects
    in Afghanistan. It uses the 2011-2012 Afghanistan National Risk and Vulnerability
    Assessment (NRVA) survey. The study also aims to improve aid intervention effectiveness
    and targeting capacities.
  6: The study aims to establish the link between floods and nutritional consumption,
    identify coping strategies, and analyze the transmission channels of flood impact
    on household income and poverty status.
  9: The study utilizes independent variables, including socioeconomic factors, to
    analyze food security outcomes. The differences in means between the flood affected
    and non-flood affected groups are statistically significant, indicating a relationship
    between flood exposure and food security.
  10: The analysis focuses on the impact of floods on household-level food consumption
    and deficiencies in Afghanistan.
  13: Coping strategies involve lowering food quality, taking out loans, and purchasing
    food on credit.
  16: Targeted disaster relief and food aid should consider micronutrient supplementation
    for vulnerable population groups. Interventions are more effective when based
    on mitigation policies already in place before the shock occurs.

  16: Flooding effect net of preshock household adaptation to climate change and government

Quantitative material:
  1: Exposure to flooding decreased daily calorie consumption by approximately 60
    kcal, increased the probability of iron, vitamin A, and vitamin C deficiency by
    11, 12, and 27 percentage points, respectively, decreased income by about 3%,
    and made flood-affected households about 3 percentage points more likely to be
    poor.
  2: flood exposure decreases household calorie consumption by only 57 or 69 kcal
    a day but is responsible for a 0.11, 0.12, and 0.27 higher probability of deficiency
    in iron, vitamin A, and vitamin C, respectively.
  3: None
  9: Provides means, standard deviations, and differences in means between flood-affected
    and non-flood-affected areas for the dependent (food security) and independent
    variables (including flood, violence, price shocks, and other socioeconomic factors).
  10: Flood exposure in the 12 months before interview has a statistically significant
    negative effect on equivalized Kcal consumption (-69.334, p<0.01 and -57.183,
    p<0.01 in two model specifications).
  11: Households exposed to floods are 2.5-3.1 percentage points more likely to be
    deemed poor. Flood exposure decreases per capita yearly income by around 3%.
  13: A flood increases poverty (0.031***, 0.025***, 0.026**) and decreases income
    (-0.030**). Price shocks increase poverty (0.097***, 0.081***). Income per capita
    decreases poverty (-0.004***).
