Drivers of Risk:
  2: Changes in temperature anomalies specified as a fraction of output lost.
  3: Changes in temperature anomalies driven by emissions of greenhouse gases resulting
    from economic growth.
  5: "Changes in temperature anomalies (\u2206TA)."
  6: Changes in temperature anomalies (global warming) driven by current economic
    growth, specifically the responsiveness of changes in temperature anomalies to
    current economic growth
  7: Climate change due to global warming stemming from economic growth that is not
    'green'.
  12: "Past values of \u2206 TA (t-1 to t-18) and past Growth rates (t-1) appear to\
    \ be drivers of current \u2206 TA."
Highlights:
  2: Rapid global warming can put economies in a fluctuating divergent balanced growth
    unless economic growth is 'green'.
  3: Convergent and divergent oscillatory growth dynamics arise depending on the strength
    of the response of changes in temperature anomalies to current economic growth.
  5: "The paper finds empirical evidence that economic growth increases \u2206TA,\
    \ and that \u2206TA tends to negatively impact economic growth."
  6: Climate change, modeled as temperature anomalies increasing with economic growth,
    can lead to either convergent or divergent oscillatory growth dynamics. Stronger
    negative influence of current growth on climate change (via temperature anomalies)
    makes divergent growth more likely.
  7: Rapid global warming can put economies in a divergent balanced growth path with
    oscillations if growth is not 'green'.
  12: "Lagged values of \u2206 TA at t-1, t-2, t-9, and t-12 are statistically significant\
    \ predictors of current \u2206 TA. Specifically, \u2206 TA at t-1 has a strong\
    \ positive effect (0.364, p<0.01), \u2206 TA at t-12 has a strong negative effect\
    \ (-0.474, p<0.01). Growth at t-1 is a significant predictor of current \u2206\
    \ TA in some cases, having alternating positive and negative effects depending\
    \ on the lag."
Methodology:
  2: Overlapping generations endogenous growth model characterized by climate change.
  3: Overlapping generations (OLG) endogenous growth model. Empirical evaluation of
    the relationship between changes in temperature anomalies and economic growth.
  5: "Unbalanced panel data set fixed-effects estimation involving 167 countries over\
    \ the annual period of 1851 to 2018. GARCH model is used to derive volatility\
    \ of \u2206TA and growth."
  6: Overlapping generations endogenous growth model characterized by climate change;
    Fixed-effects panel data estimation of 167 countries (1851-2018) used to vindicate
    assumption of endogeneous positive effect on temperature anomalies due to economic
    growth.
  7: Theoretical model with a focus on how current growth drives climate change.
  12: "Reverse-MIDAS (Mixed Data Sampling) regression is used to model \u2206 TA t.\
    \ The model incorporates lagged values of both \u2206 TA and Growth."
More Notes:
  2: Growth dynamics arise when changes in temperature anomalies is a positive function
    of current economic growth, leading to convergent or divergent oscillatory growth.
  3: The paper aims to incorporate the role of global warming in a typical OLG endogenous
    growth model.
  5: "The paper controls for the volatilities of \u2206TA and economic growth. The\
    \ analysis is conducted at a national level."
  6: "The model suggests that countries with similar responses of temperature anomalies\
    \ to economic growth are more likely to demonstrate divergent growth oscillations\
    \ if they have higher values of A and/or (1 \u2212 \u03B1 )."
  7: The model suggests current growth is always 'bad' by driving climate change.
  12: The table only shows coefficients and standard errors, without further interpretation
    or discussion of the magnitude and implications of these relationships. It is
    also only one page from a larger paper.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Economic growth, temperature anomalies
  3: Economic growth dynamics, fraction of output lost due to changes in temperature
    anomalies (climate change).
  5: Economic growth (per-capita real GDP growth).
  6: "Economic growth dynamics (gross growth rate, \u2126 t+1), productivity loss\
    \ due to climate change (\u03BB t being the fraction of production lost)"
  7: Economic growth, and climate change-induced oscillations.
  12: "\u2206 TA t, which seems to represent a change in some variable 'TA' at time\
    \ 't'. The precise meaning of 'TA' is not defined on this page but is likely a\
    \ macro-fiscal outcome. Growth (presumably GDP Growth) is also an outcome of interest."
Quantitative material:
  2: Empirical analyses involving 167 countries over a long span of historical data
    covering 1851 to 2018.
  3: Empirical evidence of the endogenous nature of changes in temperature anomalies
    based on a long span data set of a panel of 167 countries over the period of 1851
    to 2018.
  5: "\u2206TA tends to negatively impact economic growth at least at the 5% level\
    \ of significance."
  6: "Equations for the gross growth rate (\u2126 t+1), wages (wt), and rental rate\
    \ (rt), and conditions for convergent and divergent growth oscillations based\
    \ on the derivative of the growth function (m'(\u2126 t)). A and \u03B1 are parameters."
  12: "The table provides coefficients and standard errors for a regression model.\
    \ Several coefficients are statistically significant (p < 0.1, p < 0.05, p < 0.01),\
    \ indicating a statistically significant relationship between the drivers of risk\
    \ (past values of \u2206 TA and growth) and the outcome of interest (\u2206 TA\
    \ t)."
