    l and Pi,r\u2013l)"
  7: Temperature increases.

  19: "Temperature rise scenarios (1\xB0C and 6\xB0C warming relative to 2005 levels)"
  21: Temperature rise.
  23: Temperature shocks, climate conditions, weather shocks, heatwaves, climate change,
    cyclones
Highlights:
  1: "Optimal temperature of 15\xB0C, 15\xB0C, or 21\xB0C for each model. Random forests\
    \ have stable model performance and better prediction performance in bootstrapping,\
    \ but may underestimate climate impact in some cases. Temperature should be considered\
    \ in economic projections under climate change scenarios."
  2: Temperature-economic relationship is critical in estimating climate change impact;
    Different methodologies yield significantly different impact estimates; Advanced
    learning models offer an alternative to traditional models.
  4: Results suggest temperature should be accounted for in economic projections and
    contribute to modeling methods in climate econometrics.
  6: The study models the impact of temperature and precipitation, including lagged
    effects, on per capita GDP growth at a subnational level.
  7: The study focuses on presenting the results of Random Forests (RFs) due to their
    superior performance compared to other machine learning models (Decision Tree
    (DT), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Support Vector Regression (SVR)).
  9: AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) is included as a performance index, considering
    both model performance and model complexity.
  11: "Temperature increases can significantly impact national GDP, with varying estimates\
    \ depending on the region and study, ranging from a 0.78% decrease in China to\
    \ a 7% decrease globally with a 1\xB0C warming."
  12: The relationship between temperature rise and economic growth is complex, with
    variability depending on regional and contextual factors and different modeling
    techniques.
  13: Temperature rise is projected to predominantly benefit northern China in terms
    of GDP growth.
  14: RFs predict a positive but smaller GDP impact from warming compared to spline,
    while cubic regression predicts a negative impact. Traditional regression models
    (cubic and spline) show broader impacts on cells and deeper impacts on national
    GDP compared to RFs. RFs outperform traditional regressions in terms of R-squared,
    RMSE, MAE, and AIC.
  15: Random Forests (RFs) demonstrate superior model performance (higher R2, lower
    RMSE, MAE, and AIC) compared to cubic and spline regression.
  16: RFs show a lower variance and better prediction performance with higher explained
    variance and lower RMSE compared to benchmark models.
  18: Random Forest has less reduction in prediction accuracy and explanatory power
    loss compared to traditional methods when predicting sophisticated relationships
    (temperature vs. economic development).
  19: Random Forests (RFs) have limited extrapolation ability and tend to predict
    an average of previously observed values. Traditional models can extrapolate beyond
    the training sample.
  21: "For every 1\xB0C temperature rise (up to 6.5\xB0C), the national GDP change\
    \ is predicted to be 1% using random forests."
  23: Studies that quantify the impact of temperature and weather on economic outcomes
    (Dell et al., 2012; Deryugina & Hsiang, 2014; Heal & Park, 2014, 2016; Hsiang,
    2010, 2016; Kalkuhl & Wenz, 2020; Newell et al., 2021; Sandhani et al., 2023).
Methodology:
  1: Uses random forests, multivariate cubic regression, and linear spline regression
    to examine the direct impacts of temperature on economic development. Performance
    comparison of the methods via bootstrapping. Employs a thought experiment with
    national marginal GDP growth by aggregating subnational climate impact.
  2: Computable general equilibrium equations (CGEs); traditional regression methods
    (linear and nonlinear); Cobb-Douglas production function; multivariate quadratic
    regression; linear spline models; advanced learning models.
  4: A Cobb-Douglas type production function is used to model the relationship between
    temperature and per capita GDP growth.
  6: Panel regressions are used to model the relationship between per capita GDP growth
    and climate variables, with cell and time fixed effects.
  7: "Uses Random Forests (RFs) and benchmark models (cubic regression and linear\
    \ spline regression) to estimate the effect of temperature on economic growth.\
    \ The RF model is trained on 80% of the data and validated on the remaining 20%.\
    \ A thought experiment is conducted to determine the marginal prediction of rising\
    \ temperature on economic development, assuming equal temperature increases across\
    \ all cells. The analysis considers temperature rise scenarios from 0.5\xB0C to\
    \ 6.5\xB0C, retaining other variables at their 2005 values."
  8: The analysis uses projected GDP data for cells under different temperature rise
    scenarios and computes the impacts using regression models. Performance is evaluated
    using indices like R2 and RMSE.
  9: The paper uses an adjusted AIC equation from Richardson [36] because the normal
    calculation of AIC has obstacles when applied to Random Forests.
  11: The analysis involves a simple thought experiment assuming equal temperature
    increases among all cells (grid points), using equations to simulate per capita
    GDP changes, and then aggregating to national GDP. Linear and nonlinear simulations
    are also considered. Applicable when analyzing the direct influence of temperature
    on economic development at a national level.
  12: The analysis uses econometric estimates and projections of temperature rise,
    applying cubic, spline, and RF models with different lag scenarios.
  13: Analysis combining econometric estimates of temperature impact with temperature
    rise projections; results shown by different models such as RFs, cubic, and spline.
  15: Compares Random Forests (RFs) with multiple linear regression (cubic) and linear
    spline regression (spline) for predictive accuracy.
  16: 'Analysis includes traditional regressions with lagged effects of climate variables
    and robustness checks using bootstrapping across three modeling methods: cubic,
    spline, and RFs (Random Forests).'
  18: Random Forests (RFs) used to analyze relationship between temperature and economic
    development; issues with overfitting and time series trend detection addressed
    with methods like log-first difference.
  19: Random Forests (RFs), cubic regressions, and spline models are used to predict
    per capita GDP growth (gy) under different temperature scenarios. The predicted
    values are compared to the training sample to assess the impact of extrapolation.
    The paper also recommends literature review, traditional modelling and causal
    inference assessment before implementing RF models
  21: Uses 1-degree latitude by 1-degree longitude subnational quinquennial variations
    in China and Random Forests (RFs) to examine the impacts of temperature on economic
    development. A 'thought experiment' is used, assuming an equal temperature rise
    among cells to estimate the economic penalty borne of a temperature increase.
  23: References to econometric approaches, machine learning (including random forests
    and augmented synthetic control), regression analysis, spatial statistics, bootstrap
    techniques, multi-level model comparisons, and general statistical methods like
    AIC and BIC for model selection.
More Notes:
  1: The study uses subnational data from China. The study highlights the use of more
    machine learning methods in climate impact assessment.
  2: The paper discusses the challenges and limitations of using traditional regression
    methods (quadratic and linear spline) for estimating the impact of climate change
    on economic outcomes, particularly in low-temperature areas; Base-year selection
    and model settings can differentiate the results even within the same research.
  6: "The study uses five-year averages of data, which condenses changes and may capture\
    \ some slow effects with time effects. Region-year effects are considered, but\
    \ the authors choose to use \u03BAr instead of \u03BAir to avoid absorbing too\
    \ much variation in weather. The study also acknowledges that \u0394log yir is\
    \ not approximately equal to gyir, and adjusts the equation to calculate gyir."
  7: "The study uses data at the cell level and aggregates it to analyze national-level\
    \ impacts. The maximum temperature rise is set to 6.5\xB0C, based on the average\
    \ temperature change projected for China under the RCP8.5 scenario by 2100."
  9: The page focuses on model evaluation and selection rather than specific macroeconomic
    outcomes or drivers of risk related to climate change adaptation.
  11: There's a debate about optimal temperatures and their relevance to economic
    sensitivity, as well as the degree of climate adaptability between developed and
    developing nations. Micro-level data tends to support nonlinear temperature-economic
    relationships, while macro-level data often supports linear relationships.
  14: The impact of warming varies geographically within China (northern vs. southern).
    Caution should be taken when using a linear spline to depict the temperature-economic
    relationship.
  15: The study highlights the ability of Random Forests to capture non-linear patterns,
    mitigate collinearity, and handle complex interactions in climate-economic research,
    suggesting their potential advantages over traditional econometric methods.
  18: Potential issues with RFs include overfitting, trend detection difficulties,
    and lack of direct causal mechanism identification.
  19: "The study acknowledges that scenarios of warming up to 6.5\xB0C involved temperature\
    \ areas outside the training sample."
  21: The study acknowledges potential errors due to extrapolation and recommends
    regression-enhanced RFs and artificial neural networks for future research. The
    study asserts a causal link between temperature and GDP growth, validated by traditional
    models.
