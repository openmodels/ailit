    are used as forcing.

    and Aurora basins), emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5)

Highlights:
  1: "Ocean is the primary driver of short-term Antarctic mass loss; atmosphere initially\
    \ plays a mitigating role through increased snowfall, but becomes an amplifying\
    \ driver of mass loss beyond the end of the century under a very high-emission\
    \ pathway when Antarctic near-surface warming exceeds +7.5\xB0C; very high-emission\
    \ scenario leads to complete collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet and grounding-line\
    \ retreat in East Antarctica; mass loss is likely to remain confined to the Amundsen\
    \ Sea Embayment under a more sustainable socio-economic pathway."
  2: The Antarctic ice sheet's mass future is uncertain, with potential mass loss
    driving significant sea-level rise or mass gain under various climate and ice
    sheet model combinations.
  3: The paper investigates the future of the Antarctic ice sheet until the end of
    the millennium considering uncertainties in SMB and ocean-induced melt processes.
  4: No relevant information
  5: No relevant information
  8: The calibrated ensemble reproduces historical trends in ice-sheet mass change,
    reducing uncertainty in model hindcasts.
  9: Posterior distribution indicates observed and modeled rates of historical mass
    change in Antarctica; detailed spatial patterns of mass and elevation changes
    are presented.
  10: Antarctic mass loss contributes to GMSLR throughout the millennium. The pattern
    of mass loss diverges after the end of the century under different emission scenarios.
    The West Antarctic ice sheet collapses under SSP5-8.5 between 2300 and 2500. Early-millennium
    warming under SSP5-8.5 may commit the East Antarctic ice sheet to grounding-line
    retreat.
  11: The study projects the evolution of the AIS contribution to global mean sea-level
    rise under different SSP scenarios, including the probability of the AIS being
    ungrounded.
  13: Ocean-driven mass loss dominates WAIS changes while East Antarctica undergoes
    mass gain due to increased SMB. Under SSP5-8.5, the rate of GMSLR contribution
    increases beyond the 21st century due to decreased SMB and increased calving.
    During the 23rd century, surface runoff dominates Antarctic mass loss. Antarctic
    mass loss under the low-emission pathway SSP1-2.6 may be characterised by the
    first phase only.
  14: Evolution of the calibrated median contribution to global mean sea-level rise
    from Antarctica under the SSP5-8.5 scenario until 3000, focusing on the period
    2015-2100 for specific experiments separating the respective influences of the
    oceanic and atmospheric forcings and of the melt-elevation feedback, and including
    the influence of ice-shelf hydrofracturing; median rates of contribution to GMSLR
    for the whole Antarctic ice sheet, the West Antarctic ice sheet, and the East
    Antarctic ice sheet.
  15: The contribution of atmospheric and oceanic forcing to projected Antarctic mass
    changes is highlighted.
  16: Oceanic forcing is the primary driver of Antarctic mass loss during the 21st
    century. Atmospheric forcing initially mitigates ocean-driven mass loss but eventually
    contributes to it. Both oceanic and atmospheric forcings, when considered separately,
    are sufficient to trigger a complete collapse of the WAIS by the end of the millennium.
    The collapse of the WAIS under atmospheric forcing alone is driven by the melt-elevation
    feedback. EAIS mass loss is primarily ocean-driven, but grounding-line retreat
    is amplified by the melt-elevation feedback.
  17: Oceanic forcing is the primary trigger of mass loss. The melt-elevation feedback
    is crucial. Hydrofracturing significantly increases sea-level contribution, especially
    by the end of the century and beyond.
  19: "Increase in snow accumulation is the dominant factor in surface mass balance\
    \ over grounded ice until warming exceeds +7.5\xB0C, after which surface runoff\
    \ dominates.  Surface runoff fluxes over ice shelves are projected to fully offset\
    \ the increase in snow accumulation at +7.5\xB0C warming, resulting in negative\
    \ median surface mass balance.  Grounded ice sheet SMB reaches present-day value\
    \ and no longer compensates for increased ice discharge at +9\xB0C warming."
  20: Emission scenario has a limited influence on Antarctic ice loss by the end of
    the century. Ocean-driven retreat of Thwaites Glacier was already triggered during
    the historical period. West Antarctica experiences more severe ice loss than East
    Antarctica under the unabated warming path simulations.
  21: A transition in the drivers of Antarctic mass loss is suggested, switching from
    ocean-driven to atmospheric-driven mass changes, with surface runoff potentially
    dominating the mass balance by the end of the 23rd century under a very high-emission
    scenario. The model may overestimate the risk of surface melt-induced destabilisation
    due to the absence of a water-routing scheme.
  22: "Freshwater input into the ocean can create a positive feedback loop, accelerating\
    \ melt. A threshold of +7.5\xB0C warming leads to reduced SMB. PDD-based runoff\
    \ projections generally agree with climate models but may underestimate runoff\
    \ rates due to omission of the melt-albedo feedback and coarse GCM resolution."
  23: Projected changes in surface runoff are compared for the years 2100 and 2300
    with present-day grounding line and ice-sheet configurations.
  24: Credible projections of future Antarctic mass balance were produced.
  26: The Kori-ULB model's behavior is in line with results from high-resolution models
    that participated in the ISMIP6 ensemble.

    failure (Pollard, DeConto, and Alley, 2015); The far reach of ice-shelf thinning
    in Antarctica (Reese et al., 2018b).
Methodology:
  1: Observationally-calibrated ice-sheet model forced by CMIP6 climate models, projecting
    sea-level rise to 2100, 2300, and 3000 under different emission scenarios.
  2: One model including hydrofracturing and marine ice cliff instability predicts
    significant mass loss and sea-level rise equivalent by the end of the 21st century.
  3: "An ensemble of simulations is run using the ice-sheet model Kori-ULB, accounting\
    \ for uncertainties in ice\u2013ocean and ice\u2013atmosphere interactions. Bayesian\
    \ calibration of the model is performed by comparing with estimates of regional\
    \ net mass balance from IMBIE. The calibrated projections extend to the end of\
    \ the millennium using atmospheric and oceanic projections inferred from a subset\
    \ of CMIP6 models under low and very high emission scenarios. Simulations are\
    \ performed at a spatial resolution of 16 km."
  4: Ice-sheet simulations begin in 1950 CE. Hindcasts (1950-2014) use CMIP5 model
    NorESM1-M. Projections (2015-2300) use a subset of CMIP6 models. After 2300, climate
    is kept constant. Forcing is derived from SSP 5-8.5 and 1-2.6 scenarios. Climate
    forcing is implemented via anomalies (monthly-averaged air temperature, sublimation,
    precipitation ratios, yearly-averaged temperature and salinity) with respect to
    1995-2014 mean seasonal variations. Missing values for oceanic forcing are filled.
  5: "A perturbed parameter ensemble is designed including nine key parameters using\
    \ Latin hypercube sampling to create a 100-member ensemble. The designed ensemble\
    \ includes discrete inputs (initial state and climate forcing uncertainties) and\
    \ continuous parameters (ice\u2013atmosphere and ice\u2013ocean interactions).\
    \ The parameter ranges are as wide as physically plausible. Simulations are performed\
    \ for 1950-2014 (historical hindcast), socio-economic pathways, and constant present-day\
    \ climate. Additional projections were produced under SSP5-8.5."
  6: "The study uses Bayes\u2019 theorem to determine the posterior probability distribution\
    \ of uncertain input parameters, assuming a uniform prior distribution. It assigns\
    \ likelihood scores to ensemble members based on the differences between model\
    \ outputs and spatially-aggregated estimates of regional net mass balance from\
    \ the IMBIE. A multivariate Gaussian likelihood function is assumed, with discrepancies\
    \ between observed and simulated mass balance values assumed to be independent\
    \ and normally distributed. The structural error is estimated by multiplying the\
    \ observational error by a factor of 10. The CMIP5 climate model NorESM1-M was\
    \ used to produce the historical simulations. The score for each ensemble member\
    \ is then normalised to create a weight."
  8: Uses Bayesian calibration of an ensemble based on observational constraints from
    IMBIE and assesses with spatially-aggregated estimates.
  9: 100-member ensemble of simulations using Latin hypercube sampling; Bayesian calibration
    applied to model outputs.
  10: Calibrated ensemble (posterior distributions) based on modelling-based estimates
    of surface mass balance, sub-shelf melting, and iceberg calving.
  11: The analysis uses calibrated probabilistic projections of the evolution of the
    AIS, with a Bayesian calibrated mean of the ensemble (N=100). A 5-year running
    average is applied.
  13: Calibrated projections for SSP5-8.5 isolating different components of the climate
    forcing were produced using parameter vectors from section 2.2, and 100-member
    ensembles of projections were produced for specific experiments.
  14: Calibrated median contribution to global mean sea-level rise from Antarctica
    under the SSP5-8.5 scenario until 3000, with a 5-year running average applied
    to rates of contribution to GMSLR.
  15: A 100-member ensemble is used under the shared socio-economic pathways (SSP)
    5-8.5. Specific experiments considering oceanic and atmospheric drivers are performed.
    The Bayesian calibrated mean is used to compute the mean thickness change.
  16: Sensitivity analyses were performed, including atmospheric forcing only (oceanic
    boundary conditions kept constant as of 2015), oceanic forcing only (atmospheric
    forcing constant), both forcings (without melt-elevation feedback), and atmospheric
    forcing only (without melt-elevation feedback). Results are applicable to the
    21st century and beyond under a very high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5).
  17: Calibrated ensemble simulations under SSP5-8.5, with approximated hydrofracturing
    following Pollard et al., 2015; DeConto and Pollard, 2016. Analysis focuses on
    hydrofracturing, not MICI.
  19: "Analysis of ensemble median SMB, snow accumulation, and surface runoff in relation\
    \ to regional (90\u201360\xB0S) annual near-surface warming imposed by GCMs; comparison\
    \ of Antarctic near-surface warming with pre-industrial global temperature change."
  20: "Observationally-calibrated projections of the evolution of the Antarctic ice\
    \ sheet until the end of the millennium, accounting for key uncertainties in ice\u2013\
    climate interactions."
  21: Ice sheet model simulations initialized to match observations, calibrated and
    run under different emission scenarios. Evaluation is qualitative, comparing against
    spatially aggregated estimates of ice-sheet mass balance components during the
    historical period. Model does not include a water-routing scheme.
  22: The analysis uses projections based on the SSP5-8.5 and SSP1-2.6 scenarios,
    examines the relationship between median SMB estimates and regional atmospheric
    warming, and compares PDD-based melt-and-runoff projections with regional (MAR)
    and general (CESM2-WACCM) climate models. Projections extend to 2300.
  23: Uses a Bayesian calibrated ensemble to project surface runoff rates; includes
    comparison against climate models such as MAR forced by CESM2, CNRM-CM6, and CESM2-WACCM.
  24: "The study produced projections of future Antarctic mass balance considering\
    \ existing uncertainties and conditioning ensemble projections on relevant observations\
    \ (Aschwanden et al., 2021). Parameter exploration focused on ice\u2013ocean\u2013\
    atmosphere interactions.  Bayesian calibration approach was used. They used CMIP6\
    \ climate model projections until 2300."
  26: The Kori-ULB model is a vertically-integrated, thermomechanical, hybrid ice-sheet/ice-shelf
    model using shallow-ice and shallow-shelf approximations for grounded ice, and
    only the shallow-shelf approximation for floating ice shelves. It accounts for
    grounding-line migration with a flux condition and uses a Weertman sliding law
    for basal sliding. Sub-shelf melting can be determined by different parameterization
    schemes, and calving depends on crevasse depths. Input data include present-day
    ice-sheet geometry, bedrock topography, geothermal heat flux, near-surface air
    temperature, and precipitation.
  27: Uses a positive degree-day (PDD) algorithm to calculate the surface mass balance
    at the ice surface, using monthly near-surface air temperatures and precipitation
    rates as inputs.
  28: The PICO model uses box parameterization for buoyancy-driven advection of ocean
    water into the ice shelf cavity, with melt rates calculated through a specific
    equation considering ocean and freezing temperatures.
  30: 'Describes three different parameterizations for sub-shelf melting: a complex
    model (not detailed here, refers to Lazeroms et al. 2019), a local quadratic parameterization,
    and an ISMIP6 non-local quadratic parameterization.'
  31: "Uses quadratic non-local parameterizations (with and without dependency on\
    \ local slope) to model melt rates. Varies \u03B30 within specified ranges and\
    \ applies sector-specific temperature corrections derived for MeanAnt median \u03B3\
    0 values."
  32: The study uses the Kori-ULB ice-sheet model, forced with CMIP6 data and MAR
    outputs, to simulate Antarctic mass balance over past decades.
  33: The data are derived from satellite-based and modelling studies covering different
    periods from 1979 to 2018. The paper notes that these data were used to qualitatively
    assess the behavior of a calibrated ensemble over the historical period (Figure
    1).
  35: Ice sheet modeling, climate modeling (e.g., Community Earth System Model version
    2), intercomparison projects (MISMIP+).

More Notes:
  1: Focuses on uncertainties in the future balance between sub-shelf melting and
    ice discharge, and surface mass balance; melt-elevation feedback amplifies the
    impact of increased surface runoff.
  3: The study acknowledges the drawbacks of using GCM outputs directly for future
    SMB projections due to coarse resolution and simplified representation of polar
    processes and addresses biases related to melt-elevation feedback by determining
    surface melt and runoff within the ice-sheet model.

  5: No relevant information
  10: Spread in sea-level projections increases with time, especially under SSP5-8.5.
  13: 'The evolution of Antarctic mass loss under SSP5-8.5 is characterized by three
    phases: (I) ocean-driven ice loss until the end of the century, (II) decreased
    SMB beyond the end of the century, and (III) surface runoff dominated mass loss
    during the 23rd century.'
  14: The analysis uses a 100-member ensemble.
  15: Experiments include scenarios with both oceanic and atmospheric drivers, oceanic
    forcing only, atmospheric forcing only, and atmospheric forcing only without the
    melt-elevation feedback. The grounding line and calving front positions are also
    shown.
  17: The paper distinguishes between the impact of atmospheric forcing on grounded
    ice versus ice shelves. Surface mass balance over grounded ice continues to increase
    until the end of the century.
  19: The study highlights thresholds of warming beyond which the Antarctic surface
    mass balance shifts from mitigating sea-level rise to exacerbating it, with ice
    shelves being more sensitive than the grounded ice sheet.
  20: The study explored the committed long-term changes of the AIS in response to
    early-millennium warming.
  24: The study acknowledges limitations, including reliance on a single ice-sheet
    model, incomplete model physics, and choices in numerical methods, neglecting
    structural uncertainty. The higher climate sensitivity of some CMIP6 ESMs may
    not be supported by palaeo-climate records. Observational estimates used for calibration
    only consider spatially-integrated quantities, potentially obscuring unrealistic
    spatial trends.

    West Antarctic ice sheet mass balance from 1992-2011.
  9: "Bayesian calibrated distributions of mass change over the period 1950-2014 with\
    \ 5\u201395% probability intervals."
  10: 'Median contributions to GMSLR by end of century: 6 (-8 to 15) cm under SSP1-2.6
    and 5.5 (-10 to 16) cm under SSP5-8.5. GMSLR contribution by 2300 under SSP5-8.5:
    2.75 (0.46 to 4.52) m; by 3000: 6.95 (2.40 to 13.47) m. GMSLR contribution by
    2300 under SSP1-2.6: 0.62 (-0.26 to 1.56) m; by 3000: 1.85 (-0.73 to 2.90) m.
    Thwaites Glacier retreat leads to a median sea-level contribution of 2 (-6 to
    9) cm by end of century, 0.20 (-0.17 to 1.21) m by 2300, and 1.32 (-0.4 to 2.1)
    m by end of millennium under constant present-day climate.'
  11: "The paper presents projections of sea-level rise until 3000, with a focus on\

  13: Median sub-shelf melt fluxes reach their maximum around 2150. Median surface
    runoff reaches almost 6000 gigatons per year by 2300.
  14: The boxes and whiskers represent the 100-member ensemble posterior, indicating
    the [5, 25, 50, 75, 95] percentiles at 3000 (a) and 2100 (b) (N=100 per experiment).
  15: Mean ice thickness change is computed using the Bayesian calibrated mean of
    the ensemble (N=100 per experiment).
  16: Oceanic forcing alone produces the highest median Antarctic contribution to
    GMSLR during the 21st century. Atmospheric forcing alone initially leads to mass
    gain (negative median rates of contribution to GMSLR). WAIS mass loss rates under
    both oceanic and atmospheric forcing reach approximately 10 mm per year. Atmospheric
    forcing alone leads to positive GMSLR contribution around 2150.
