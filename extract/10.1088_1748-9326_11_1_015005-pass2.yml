Drivers of Risk:
  1: High temporal and spatial rainfall variability; Climate shocks like droughts.
  3: Climate impacts on the food-water-trade system in southern Africa through changes
    in drought severity and precipitation indices.
  4: prolonged and widespread drought in southern Africa
  5: "Drought of 1991\u20131992 led to significant changes in food imports and exports\
    \ by southern Africa."
  6: Drought
  7: Drought severity impacts agricultural GDP and maize yield; rainfall variability
    influences virtual water content and agricultural production.
  9: "Droughts and climate variability, notably linked to El Ni\xF1o events, impacting\
    \ southern Africa."
  10: Droughts (specifically the 1991-1992 drought) and inter-annual climate variability.
  11: Water scarcity due to declining precipitation and increased external food imports
    in southern Africa.
Highlights:
  1: Regional food trade is efficient in terms of water use but may be unsustainable.
  3: The study compares changes in southern Africa's food-water-trade system with
    climatic conditions, analyzing impacts on agricultural productivity and trade.
  4: crop VWC values peak across most of the region in 1992, especially for irrigation-based
    VWC, reflecting an unusually low crop water productivity, due to the prolonged
    and widespread drought in southern Africa at the time.
  5: Southern Africa saw a four-fold increase in food imports to meet drought-induced
    supply deficits in 1992 and a 90% drop in exports, followed by a 12-fold increase
    in exports after the drought recovery.
  6: Irrigation use per unit crop increases (i.e., higher blue VWC) with drought severity
    (lower PDSI) in Southern African nations (except Tanzania). Maize green VWC also
    increases with drought severity.
  7: Despite region-wide low productivity, trade patterns currently save water resources;
    significant yield gaps remain in southern Africa due to insufficient nutrient
    and water inputs.
  9: Water resources were saved due to extra-regional food imports, mitigating some
    impacts of drought.
  10: Trade can redistribute food across continents in a water-efficient way in response
    to food production gaps. Wetter years correspond to higher water productivity.
    The 1991-1992 drought had a clear impact, but the effects of other droughts are
    less notable at regional and national levels.
  11: Regional trade is important for compensating food deficits and managing drought-induced
    production shocks.
Methodology:
  1: "Combines global hydrological model simulations with international food trade\
    \ data to quantify the water resources embedded in international food trade in\
    \ southern Africa and with the rest of the world, from 1986\u20132011. Analyzes\
    \ the impacts of socio-economic changes and climatic variability on agricultural\
    \ trade and embedded water resources during this period."
  3: "Linear regressions between climate indices (PDSI, cumulative PRCP) and agriculture-related\
    \ economic metrics (VWC, Trade, agricultural GDP) from 1986\u20132011, with both\
    \ national and gridded data analyses."
  4: "perform panel linear regression on the entire dataset \u201413 countries and\
    \ 27 years\u2014between agricultural GDP, maize VWC, VWI and food imports on the\
    \ one hand and WAP(+) and WAP(-) on the other hand, with country fixed effects."
  5: Analysis of food and virtual water trade patterns from 1986 to 2011 in southern
    Africa and its extra-regional trading partners.
  6: Linear regressions comparing national annual Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)
    and Precipitation (PRCP) indices with national Virtual Water Content (VWC), food
    imports, Virtual Water Imports (VWIs), and GDP; as well as PDSI and PRCP with
    gridded maize yield in each country.
  7: The analysis uses panel regression with country fixed effects to examine relationships
    between precipitation, drought severity, and agricultural outputs.
  10: The study analyzes relationships between climate variables (precipitation, PDSI),
    food trade (imports, exports), virtual water import (VWI), and agricultural GDP
    using linear regressions and panel regression.
More Notes:
  1: The role of imports from the rest of the world in the region's food supply is
    important, in particular during severe droughts. Trade can efficiently redistribute
    water resources across continents in response to a sudden gap in food production.
  4: "Green water generally dominates VWC over blue water, re\uFB02ecting the low\
    \ levels of irrigation in the region"
  6: The nature of the relationship between PDSI and national food imports varies
    (negative and positive slopes).
  7: Trade could become more water-efficient through targeted improvements in wetter
    countries; regional scale trade saves water despite exports from more water-stressed
    to less water-stressed regions.
  10: The relationship between climate and agricultural GDP is strongest when using
    panel regression. Enhanced trade openness allowed the region to benefit from trade.
    Differences in water productivity between trading partners can influence trade
    patterns. The impact of the 1991-1992 drought is evident from a strong rebound
    of extra-regional exports in 1994, following high regional crop production in
    1993 and 1994.
  11: The paper highlights the role of trade in resource allocation, particularly
    under conditions of water scarcity.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic growth hindered by high rainfall variability.
  4: No relevant information
  6: No relevant information
  9: The drought significantly affected agricultural production, with maize yields
    more than halved during the 1991-1992 drought, impacting crop water productivity.
  10: Droughts impact maize yields and overall regional crop production, affecting
    regional trade dynamics and potentially impacting the agro-economy.
Outcomes of Interest:
  7: There is a negative influence of low rainfall on agricultural GDP across the
    region; maize yield decreases with drought severity, which can lead to potential
    productivity losses.
Quantitative Material:
  7: 'Statistically significant relationships found: Angola''s agricultural GDP decreases
    with drought severity (slope 1.01, R2 0.24); Zimbabwe and Namibia show positive
    relationships between rainfall and agricultural GDP (R2 of 0.29 and 0.31).'
Quantitative material:
  1: Regional food trade is efficient in terms of water use but may be unsustainable
    because water-productive exporters, like South Africa, rely on increasingly stressed
    water resources.
  4: a 17% increase in per capita food supply has occurred over the period, from about
    120 to 140 kg/cap/yr
  6: No relevant information
  9: Quantitative data on precipitation levels and maize yield reductions during the
    drought years are provided.
  10: "Maize yields in southern Africa fell from 2713 kg ha\u22121 in 1994 to 1380\
    \ kg ha\u22121 in 1995."
