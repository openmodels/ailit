Drivers of Risk:
  1: Projected climate-change scenarios in Chile for the years 2040 and 2070, affecting
    land and labor use in agriculture and forestry.
  2: Climate change leading to salinization and desertification of agricultural lands,
    reduced precipitation, shrinking glaciers.
  3: Changes in relative net incomes per hectare of different land-use activities
    at the municipality level due to climate change impacts on yields, conditioned
    on cost structures of land-use activities.
  4: Climate change, specifically variations in water availability and projected climatic
    changes, impacts crop productivity. Scenarios are based on IPCC's A2 (severe)
    and B2 (moderate) emission projections for 2040 and 2070. Restrictions on the
    supply of irrigation water result from projected hydrological changes associated
    with climate changes.
  7: Climate change impacts on crop yields leading to changes in land allocation and
    net incomes; specific climate scenarios (B240, B270, A240, A270) representing
    moderate and severe climate change in 2040 and 2070; alterations in geographic
    distribution of crop activities in response to projected yield impacts.
  8: Different climate-change scenarios (A240, B240, A270, B270) affecting land use
    and crop yields.
  9: Climate change, specifically changes in temperature and water stress, leading
    to shifts in agricultural productivity.
  10: Climate change (specifically changes in rainfall levels and arid conditions),
    leading to a southward shift of climate zones
  11: Climate change leading to increasing water scarcity
  12: Climate change impacting avocado yields and changes in relative profitability
    of crops leading to mitigation/substitution actions by farmers.
  13: Climate change (moderate and severe scenarios); Water availability (especially
    irrigation); Agroclimatic zone shifts; Deterioration of growing conditions in
    northern zones
  14: Severe climate-change scenario (unspecified); moderate climate-change scenario
    (unspecified); changes in temperature and precipitation; potential reductions
    in irrigation; shifts in agroclimatic zones.
  15: Climate change impacts on crop production.
Highlights:
  1: Impacts of climate changes will be mitigated by land-use adaptation, with main
    export-earning crops tending to move south and agricultural employment expected
    to decrease in all scenarios.
  2: Climate change is likely to affect the agriculture sector by leading to the salinization
    and desertification of agricultural lands in northern and central Chile, with
    potential welfare implications.
  3: The impact of anticipated climate change on total land use in Chile is relatively
    small due to the ability of decision-makers to adapt by adjusting their portfolios
    of activities within each locality.
  7: Annual crops and fruit plantations decline in land area in the near term (2040),
    while pastures/forage and forestry increase; by 2070, there is some recovery in
    land planted with field crops and fruits, but pastures/forage fall below the baseline,
    and forestry becomes increasingly important; table grapes are projected to lose
    land under all scenarios, while avocado plantations are projected to expand.
  8: Severe climate-change scenarios lead to significant losses in net income for
    the forestry and agriculture sectors. The fruit category is particularly vulnerable,
    with substantial revenue declines under severe scenarios.
  9: Aggregate net income decreases under A240 and A270 scenarios, but increases under
    B240 and B270. Aggregate farm labor demand decreases under all climate-change
    scenarios, with the most notable decline (18%) under the severe A270 scenario.
  10: Climate change is projected to decrease the total land area suitable for rainfed
    wheat cultivation in Chile. The northern regions are expected to experience relatively
    larger proportional decreases in wheat land. The southernmost region considered
    (Los Lagos) is projected to show an increase in land for wheat cultivation.
  11: Land area with table grapes is projected to decline in the order of 21 and 47
    percent, depending on the severity of the climate-change scenario. Geographic
    shift in table grape activity from northern to southern zones.
  12: Climate change is projected to increase the area planted with avocados in Chile,
    with the increase varying by region and climate-change scenario. This is due to
    both direct impacts on yields and farmer responses to changes in profitability.
  13: Adaptation and land-use substitution can offset the negative impacts of climate
    change on farmer and worker welfare; The overall impact of climate change on total
    land use is relatively small due to adaptation and shifts in agroclimatic zones;
    Specific crops and localities experience more significant changes, especially
    related to water availability; Land devoted to plantation forestry increases
  14: Aggregate impacts of climate change on Chilean agriculture are likely to be
    relatively small; Climate change may shift agroclimatic zones southward, altering
    local crop patterns but preserving overall composition of production; Farmer adaptability
    and mitigation through land-use responses are important for welfare; Impacts at
    the national level are moderate due to north-south diversity and farmers' ability
    to switch activities.
  15: Climate change will likely bring some losses to various communities linked to
    agriculture in Chile, but it cannot be ruled out that it may also lead to opportunities.
Methodology:
  1: A farmland allocation model was developed, driven by expected relative net incomes
    per hectare, constructed from local average yields, regional output prices, and
    production costs, with sensitivities estimated using historical land allocations
    from agricultural censuses.
  2: "Model of agricultural land allocations and labor use in Chile under alternative\
    \ climate-change scenarios, based on locally scaled simulations from the Hadley\
    \ Center\u2019s Precis model, focuses on farmer-decision-based changes to land\
    \ allocation among 25 different activities for 2040 and 2070 under two climate\
    \ regimes."
  3: An econometric model is used to simulate land allocations at the municipal level
    based on expected relative net incomes per hectare, using historical price, yield,
    and cost data from the Chilean Agricultural Census (1997 and 2007), projections
    of average per-hectare yields under climate conditions, and estimates of crop-specific
    labor requirements.
  4: The study simulates land allocation based on projected climatic changes and water
    availability. Crop productivity was altered only by projected climatic changes
    and variations in water availability. The total amount of agricultural and forestry
    land remained constant. Agronomic simulation models were used to estimate expected
    yield performance for each crop under climate change scenarios.
  7: Land allocations are modeled based on expected profitabilities of activities
    using the 2020 climate state as a base; it's assumed that investment decisions
    are made before the future climate state is realized; Hadley Centre Coupled Model
    climate scenarios are used.
  8: Analysis of land use changes under different climate scenarios and their impact
    on net income for different activities (crops, fruits and vines, pastures and
    forage, forestry).
  9: The analysis is based on real price and cost data from the last agricultural
    census year of 2007. Labor demand is translated into year-employment equivalents
    (full-time workers working 44 hours per week). The quantity of labor demanded
    depends on per-hectare technical requirements that are also sensitive to yields.
  10: The study projects the impact of climate change on land suitable for rainfed
    wheat in ten Chilean regions under different climate change scenarios (A240, B240,
    A270, B270) with a baseline of 2007, projecting out to 2040 and 2070. The analysis
    uses pre-2015 regional definitions.
  12: The analysis models the direct influence of climate change on avocado yields
    at the municipal level and the mitigation/substitution actions of farmers.
  13: Simulation of land use changes under different climate change scenarios to 2070
  14: The paper uses a modeling approach. It does not describe it in great detail
    on this page, but it makes use of climate and yield data.  It simulates changes
    and considers farmer adaptability and land-use responses. It also contrasts its
    methods with a Ricardian model of self-reported land values as a function of weather
    variables and farmer characteristics and also with an optimization algorithm for
    land allocations
  15: Land-use projection model, simulation based on farmer decisions being long term
    and based on a known, prior climate state, limited by ceteris paribus nature.
More Notes:
  2: The study assumes farmers make long-run decisions prior to the realization of
    a particular climate scenario and maintains ceteris paribus (other factors remain
    unchanged).
  3: The study focuses on agricultural land use and labor demand at the municipal
    level in Chile, considering adaptation through changes in land allocation. The
    study acknowledges its approach is different from programming models due to data
    limitations in Chile.
  4: The study focuses on ten fruits, vines, eight irrigated and rainfed field crops,
    two forestry plantation crops, two categories of pasture, alfalfa and fallow land.
    The pasture activities included hay, forage and grazing for dairy and beef cattle.
  7: The analysis focuses on land use changes in the agricultural and forestry sectors
    in Chile; asset fixity in agriculture (unrecoverable fixed costs) is mentioned
    as a factor creating inertia in land-use changes.
  8: The results pertain to the income for specific activities in the agriculture
    sector under different climate change scenarios, focusing on the impact on land
    use, yields and revenues. The model results seem to be valid for the years 2040
    and 2070, and under the specific A240/A270/B240/B270 climate scenarios.
  9: The scenarios appear to be named according to the SRES system, where A and B
    are scenario families, and the number may refer to a year in the 21st century.
  10: The paper focuses on the impact on specific crops (rainfed wheat, table grapes,
    and avocados) and explicitly mentions the importance of table grapes to national
    accounts. This page focuses on rainfed wheat.
  11: The analysis suggests that climate change will cause a shift in agricultural
    land use, with table grapes moving south due to deteriorating climate conditions
    in the north. There is a mitigation and substitution effect as landowners shift
    to alternative crops less affected by water scarcity.
  12: The maps (Figure 2) show hectares under grapes, which is not relevant to the
    outcome of avocado production and is therefore not reported.
  13: The study focuses on Chile. The maps provided visually represent changes in
    land use for avocado cultivation under different climate scenarios in 2070.
  14: The simulation results cannot reflect the full range of possible changes at
    the level of communities and individual farmer households. Spatial redistributions
    of impacts may occur, with losses in some areas offset by gains in others.
  15: The model does not account for changes in international prices, technologies,
    trade agreements, or other shocks. Future work should address a more dynamic process
    of climate adaptation and incorporate a political-economic model of possible land
    policy changes.

Quantitative material:
  2: Primary production of agriculture and forestry sectors accounts for approximately
    3% of Chile's GDP; agriculture employs approximately 12% of the total national
    workforce; primary and processed agricultural and forestry products represent
    about 15% to 20% of Chile's annual merchandise export earnings.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Yields were projected for twelve crops in the study under four climate-change
    scenarios (A240, A270, B240 and B270). Per-hectare labor requirements and cost
    estimates were based on standardized crop budgets, using nominal prices converted
    to CLP in December 2007.
  7: Projected land use changes (in hectares and percentages) for annual crops, fruit
    plantations, pastures and forage lands, and forestry land under different climate
    change scenarios (2040 and 2070) relative to a baseline derived from agricultural
    census data.
  8: Under severe climate change (A240 and A270), net revenues for forestry and agriculture
    sectors will decrease by 5 percent in 2040 from the baseline, and 14 percent by
    2070. Under moderate climate change (B240 and B270), there is a slight increase
    in income over the baseline. Fruit net revenues are expected to decline by 76
    percent under severe climate change (A270) and 31 percent under moderate climate
    change.
  9: Table 2 presents net income by land-use activity (Field crops, Fruits, Pastures
    and forage, Forestry) under different climate change scenarios (Baseline, A240,
    A270, B240, B270) in millions of 2007 USD. Table 3 shows the number of employee-years
    by activity under different climate-change scenarios (Baseline, A240, A270, B240,
    B270) in thousands of employee-years.
  10: Land area under rainfed wheat by region and climate change scenario (hectares)
    is quantified in Table 4, including baseline, A240/B240, A270, and B270 scenarios.
    Percentage decreases in wheat surface area are also quantified.
  11: "Land area under table grapes by region and climate-change scenario (hectares)\
    \ under Baseline, A240/B240, A270, and B270 scenarios. Specific figures are given\
    \ for Atacama, Coquimbo, Valpara\xEDso, Metropolitana, O\u2019Higgins, Maule,\
    \ Biob\xEDo, Araucan\xEDa, Los R\xEDos, Los Lagos regions."
  12: "Table 6 provides area (hectares) planted with avocados by region (Atacama,\
    \ Coquimbo, Valpara\xEDso, Metropolitana, O\u2019Higgins, Maule, Biob\xEDo, Araucan\xED\
    a, Los R\xEDos, Los Lagos) and climate-change scenario (LB, A240/B240, A270, B270).\
    \ Total area planted with avocados increases from approximately 40,000 hectares\
    \ at baseline to almost 50,000 hectares in the most severe climate-change scenario\
    \ (2070). Increase in land dedicated to avocados is 7 percent relative to the\
    \ baseline by the year 2040."
  13: Avocado plantations expand to 56,000 hectares in severe change scenario; Total
    land use for field crops declines slightly in severe scenario; Land with field
    crops increases by over 4% in moderate scenario; Land area devoted to fruit increases
    by slightly over 5% under moderate change scenario.
  14: "Severe climate-change scenario leads to slight declines in total agricultural\
    \ net-income, moderate climate-change scenario would increase income, total labor\
    \ demand falls, a 2.5\u25E6C increase in mean temperature and a 10 percent decrease\
    \ in precipitation would increase land values by 40 percent for medium and large\
    \ farmers and have almost no effect for small farmers. Optimization algorithm\
    \ finds an overall reduction of 2.7 percent in net income at the national level\
    \ under the severe A2 climate scenario for 2040."
