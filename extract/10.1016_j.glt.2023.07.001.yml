Drivers of Risk:
  3: Fossil fuel combustion leading to air pollution; Climate change causing higher
    temperatures, extreme weather events, food insecurity, and displacement.
  5: Climate change and air pollution; preterm birth (PTB) and low birth weight (LBW)
    induced by air pollution and climate change
  6: Fossil fuel combustion's impediment on future human capital accumulation in children
    leading to reduced lifetime earnings.
Highlights:
  3: Environmental exposures (air pollution, climate change) negatively impact child
    health (neurodevelopmental effects, malnutrition, infectious and respiratory diseases)
    leading to human capital losses (reduced IQ, lower schooling, chronic disease).
  5: Climate change and air pollution can lead to long-term human capital (health,
    cognition, and non-cognition) impacts, with associated economic costs.
  6: Fossil fuel combustion can cause multiple health effects on children, which can
    further affect a range of health, cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes (e.g.,
    human capital) in people's adulthood, resulting in possibly more substantial socio-economic
    losses in the future.
Methodology:
  3: Flowchart depicts pathways from environmental exposures to child health effects
    and subsequent human capital losses; Literature review citing various studies
    on specific links.
  6: The paper calls for a holistic assessment of the full range of impacts of fossil
    fuel combustion borne by children.
More Notes:
  3: The paper primarily focuses on the pathway from environmental factors to child
    health impacts and human capital, implying potential macroeconomic consequences,
    but it does not explicitly quantify the macroeconomic or fiscal effects.
  5: The paper calls for a holistic assessment of the direct impacts of health damages
    on children and the indirect impacts of long-term human capital and associated
    economic costs.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Potential long-term impacts on GDP and productivity due to impaired cognitive
    function, reduced schooling years, and increased disease burden, but not quantified.
  5: Substantial economic losses due to medical costs or impaired labor productivity;
    lowered income and self-esteem; losses due to substantial medical and non-medical
    expenditures over the life course
  6: Macroeconomic losses from potential productivity loss due to child human capital
    impairments.
Quantitative material:
  6: The microeconomic losses from child human capital impairments, and the macroeconomic
    losses from their potential productivity loss have not been fully estimated.
