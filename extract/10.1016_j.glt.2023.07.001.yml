Drivers of Risk:
  1: Fossil fuel combustion leading to climate change and air pollution are identified
    as threats.
  4: Extreme temperatures (heat, cold, variations), air pollution (PM, O3, black carbon),
    aeroallergens (pollens, molds), extreme weather events (heatwaves, wildfires,
    dust storms, hurricanes, flooding), climate-related droughts and sea-level rises.
  5: Climate change and air pollution are identified as drivers that could lead to
    adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth (PTB) and low birth weight (LBW),
    affecting cognitive and non-cognitive development.
  6: Fossil fuel combustion leading to climate change and air pollution are the drivers
    of risk.
Evaluation overview:
  1: The paper aims to summarize health effects of fossil fuel-driven air pollution
    and climate change on children and the impact on human capital.
  4: Human capital, focusing on health, cognitive ability, and non-cognitive/socio-emotional
    ability.
  5: This page provides an overview of the cognitive and non-cognitive impacts of
    climate change and air pollution on human capital, particularly focusing on children's
    health and development.
  6: The paper provides a comprehensive picture of the profound impacts of fossil
    fuel use on the current and future generations, focusing on health, cognitive,
    and non-cognitive outcomes in children that can affect their adulthood and result
    in socioeconomic losses.
Highlights:
  1: Fossil fuel combustion can significantly impact the lifelong health and human
    capital for generations.
  4: Climate change harms respiratory health through multiple routes (extreme temperatures,
    air pollution, aeroallergens). Air pollution affects children's mental health.
    Early-life health impairments associated with climate change or air pollution
    predict illness or disability in adulthood.
  5: Adverse birth outcomes due to climate change and air pollution lead to cognitive
    deficits and non-cognitive issues such as introversion and risk avoidance in PTB/LBW-born
    children.
  6: The paper highlights the underestimation of health burdens borne by children
    in current health assessments and calls for a holistic assessment of the full
    range of impacts of fossil fuel combustion on children, including mental health
    and neurodevelopment. It also emphasizes the long-term human capital impacts of
    adverse birth outcomes and child health damages.
Methodology:
  4: Review of existing literature on the effects of climate change and air pollution
    on children's health and human capital development.
More Notes:
  1: The authors call for a holistic assessment of impacts on children's health, human
    capital, and economic costs.
  5: The paper emphasizes the need for holistic assessments on the long-term impacts
    of climate change and air pollution on human capital, highlighting current knowledge
    gaps.
  6: The paper proposes priorities for future research, including empirical studies
    to clarify the relationships between environmental risks, child health, and future
    human capital impacts. It also urges interdisciplinary efforts to monetize child
    health and human capital impacts.
Quantitative material:
  4: Approximately 37% of deaths related to heat exposure due to anthropogenic climate
    change during 1991-2018.
  5: Information indicates preterm birth children have IQ scores 11-12 points lower,
    and low birth weight children have IQ scores 10 points lower than their peers.
