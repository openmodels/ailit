Drivers of Risk:
  3: No relevant information
  4: Population growth, changes in population composition (age, urban-rural residence,
    household structure) affect carbon emissions and climate systems.
  5: Demographic changes, geography, infrastructure, access to various forms of capital,
    and social and cultural factors influence vulnerability to climate change impacts.
    Population growth is a driving force of emissions growth.
  6: Population growth is identified as a driver of greenhouse gas emissions, influencing
    energy consumption and carbon emissions.
  9: The main driver of risk highlighted is demographic changes, specifically urbanization
    and population growth, impacting greenhouse gas emissions.
  12: Population aging, urbanization, and technological change (related to energy
    and carbon intensity)
  13: Aging population, technological changes, population size, changes in demographic
    composition
  14: Global warming (specifically small values of warming, 1 to 2.5 degrees Celsius,
    and greater warming in the long run). Uneven distribution of climate change effects.
  18: Sea-level rise, extreme weather, and increased intensity of tropical cyclones
    due to global warming.
  19: Climate change, global warming.
  22: Rapid population growth in sub-Saharan Africa; lower population growth rate
    in Eastern Europe and China; Changes in policy attention to population stabilization;
    weakened health care and family planning services; imbalance between demographic
    growth rates and social, economic and environmental goals.
Highlights:
  3: No relevant information
  4: Population dynamics are critical for building climate change resilience and within
    adaptation strategies.
  5: Population factors have yet to be fully incorporated into adaptation strategies.
    Climate models may be underestimating the impacts of population on climate change
    due to limitations in the demographic component.
  6: A one percent increase in population is generally associated with a one percent
    increase in carbon emissions.
  9: Population size and urbanization significantly affect total greenhouse gas emissions,
    with total emissions rising from 1,500,000 units to 4,000,000 units with full
    urbanization over 50 years, assuming constant per capita emissions.
  12: The impact of population compositional changes (mainly aging) on carbon emissions
    can be larger than that of technological changes. Aging generally drives emissions
    down, but technological changes contribute to slightly higher emissions in the
    first half of the century due to increased energy efficiency encouraging more
    energy consumption. Emissions level will be higher in the case of considering
    only technological change than in the case of considering only aging before 2085.
  13: Up to 2085, the aging population can contribute more to carbon emissions than
    technological changes. Technological improvements after 2050 can substantially
    reduce carbon emissions. The impact of population size and changes in demographic
    composition are important factors in addressing climate change.
  14: Poorest countries and population groups will bear the brunt of changes related
    to climate change; attention to adaptation strategies will be critical for these
    countries.
  18: 20 percent of the population in developing countries will be affected by sea-level
    rise and extreme weather, leading to substantial economic losses.
  19: Climate change will increase hunger and the spread of vector-borne diseases,
    especially in less developed countries, resulting in increased deaths and disability-adjusted
    life years.
  22: Family planning and reproductive health have significant implications for future
    population dynamics, particularly for the global poor. Slowing population growth
    could help countries buy time to promote education, advance technological progress,
    achieve rapid economic growth, and increase their resilience and capacity to adapt
    to climate change.
Methodology:
  3: No relevant information
  4: Explores how global population dynamics affect carbon emissions and climate systems
    and adaptation.
  6: The analysis uses multinational time series data over several decades to explore
    the net effect of population growth on carbon emissions, controlling for other
    variables like economic growth and technology related to energy efficiency and
    carbon intensity. Statistical analysis of historical data informs projections
    of future climate change.
  9: A hypothetical community model is used to illustrate demographics' impact on
    emissions, assuming constant per capita emissions and changes in urbanization.
  12: 'The analysis uses a model to test different emission paths under four cases:
    no technological change or aging, both technological change and aging, only aging,
    and only technological change. Sensitivity analyses were used to understand the
    relative importance of aging and technological changes.'
  13: The analysis projects carbon emissions based on scenarios considering population
    aging, technological changes, and population size from 2000 to 2100. The effects
    of population compositional change (aging) on climate system may be more significant
    than technological changes up to the year 2085.

    information related to the defined categories.
  6: The IPCC's Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) identifies population
    growth, economic growth, technological change, and changes in patterns of energy
    and land use as major drivers of greenhouse gas emissions growth. The projections
    produced by various climate models suggest a mixed relationship between population
    growth and carbon emissions in future decades.
  12: The analysis focuses on China and mentions a similar analysis for the U.S. in
    Figure 4.
  13: The paper suggests that consumption and emission behaviors differ among population
    groups and that changes in the proportion of these groups will affect future emissions.
    It also notes that mitigation is not the only solution and that adaptation to
    climate change is necessary.
  14: The distribution of climate-related hazards (cyclones, droughts, floods, and
    landslides) is uneven across regions, concentrating in certain areas and disproportionately
    affecting low-income populations.
  19: The consequences of vector-borne diseases in richer countries may be felt more
    in economic than health terms due to disease control measures.

  5: "Between 1800 and 2000, energy use increased 35 fold, carbon emissions increased\
    \ 20 fold, global income increased 70 times, and the world\u2019s population grew\
    \ by a factor of 6."
  6: Table 2 provides estimates of the percentage increase in carbon emissions per
    1% increase in population, based on several studies. The estimates range from
    0.98 to 1.43.
  12: 'Figure 3 shows projected carbon emissions (GtC/year) in China from 2000 to
    2100 under different scenarios: with aging and urbanization, with aging and technological
    change, with only aging, and with only technological change. Without aging or
    technological change, total emissions increase from 1.5 GtC in 2000 to 3.6 GtC
    in 2100. With both technological change and aging, emissions increase to 2 GtC
    by the end of the century.'
  13: 'Figure 4 shows projected carbon emissions (GtC/YR) from 2000 to 2100 under
    different scenarios: Aging + Technology, Aging Only, Technology Only, and Population
    Size. Up to 2085, the aging population contributes more to emissions than technology,
    but after 2050 further technological improvements cause emissions under the aging
    + technology scenario to fall below the aging only scenario.  Before 2085, emissions
    under the Technology Only scenario exceed those under the Aging Only scenario.'
  18: A sea-level rise of 38 cm could increase the number of people flooded by storm
    surges five-fold.
  19: An additional 90 to more than 125 million people by 2080 in the poor nations
    will be at risk of hunger; in 2000, globally 154,000 deaths (0.3% of total) and
    5.5 million DALYs (0.5% of all DALYs) attributed to climate changes; health impacts
    projected to approximately double by 2020; deaths due to climate change by 2030
    will increase 3 percent for diarrhea, 5 percent for malaria, and 10 percent for
    malnutrition.
