Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increasing frequency and severity of extreme events, from rising temperatures,
    droughts, extreme rainfall, and rising sea levels, have increased throughout North
    America.
  6: Increased average temperatures; Increased frequency and intensity of extreme
    events (tropical storms, hurricanes, fires, heat waves, torrential rains, floods,
    landslides, droughts, wildfires); Rising sea levels; Ocean acidification (decreased
    pH on the Pacific coast).
  7: Increasing storm surge and high wind risk from tropical cyclones; Concentration
    of people and assets along the shore; Increasing vulnerability to tropical storms;
    Urban sprawl exposes higher destructible values to thunderstorms; Changing climatic
    conditions lead to more frequent and intense droughts and heat waves.
  8: Reducing snow and ice cover, increasing extreme weather (heatwaves, drought,
    storms, extreme precipitation, wildfires, freezing rain, windstorms associated
    with tropical storms).
  10: Climate change consequences on health (cardiovascular; respiratory tract infections;
    non-communicable respiratory illness, vector-borne, waterborne, and food-borne;
    mental health); Direct climatic exposure (extreme event i.e., heatwaves or hurricane);
    Indirect climatic exposure (i.e., malnutrition, anxiety about climate change).
  12: Climate-related disasters (cold waves, droughts, wildfires, river and coastal
    floods, windstorms); Sea Level Rise
  14: More frequent and severe climate impacts in North America. Extreme events damaging
    economically important supply-chain infrastructure and disrupting regional and
    international trade.
  15: Climate change; Limited, short-term focused, fragmented or inexistent adaptation
    efforts; Limited impact of scientific evidence on decision making; High risk perception
    is insufficient to motivate adaptation; Increasing global warming limiting adaptation
    options and increasing their cost.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change impacts are global in scope and unprecedented in scale in North
    America, and adaptation requires immediate action, especially for the most vulnerable.
    The economic and financial dimension of these impacts and adaptation measures
    should be highlighted.
  6: Extreme events are becoming more intense and frequent in North America, posing
    threats to adaptation agendas.
  7: Storms are a major source of economic losses. The East and Gulf Coasts of North
    America are particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones. Droughts and heat waves
    can impact all sectors of the economy.
  8: Climate change threatens North American aquatic ecology, water quality, water
    availability for human uses, and flood exposure, impacting sectors like energy,
    industry, food system, health, and key infrastructure and cities.
  10: "Mexico\u2019s vulnerability to climate change deserves broader attention to\
    \ the health dimension."
  12: Climate change and urbanization in North America are creating significant economic
    costs, especially due to extreme events and sea level rise, and that there are
    gaps in adaptation planning and financial support.
  14: System transformation to adapt to climate change are advancing slowly and unevenly
    in North America. Adaptation has received less attention than mitigation in national
    responses to climate change, particularly in the U.S. and Mexico. National administrations
    have had different approaches to climate change due to domestic circumstances,
    political constraints, and ideological positions.
  15: Negative consequences of inaction are already high and will continue to increase,
    particularly for the most vulnerable groups.
Methodology:
  1: Reflection on evidence recently produced by the Working Group 2 of the IPCC in
    relation to the North American region (Canada, USA, Mexico), based on impacts
    and adaptation assessments revised in available literature.
  6: "Reflection based on the IPCC Report AR6 \u2013 2022"
More Notes:
  1: The authors propose further research at the subnational level, particularly in
    Mexico.
  6: The paper focuses on Mexico and North America in general, drawing heavily on
    the IPCC AR6 report.
  10: The paper is a reflection based on the IPCC AR6 report. It highlights gaps in
    national and subnational assessments of health implications related to climate
    change in North America. The paper itself doesn't present new quantitative findings,
    but points to the need for more research in this area, especially in Mexico.
  14: The paper emphasizes the urgency of adaptation actions in North America but
    acknowledges significant challenges, including differing national approaches,
    political constraints, and insufficient attention to adaptation compared to mitigation.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Adaptation to climate change will be more difficult and costly, particularly
    for the most vulnerable social groups and economic activities and ecosystems.
  6: No relevant information
  7: Negative impact on key economic infrastructure, sectors, and social wellbeing
    and security, including a growing number of fatalities, from tropical storms.
  8: Observed climate change impacts and projected risks to maintain and improve economic
    growth and open opportunities for sustainable development in North America.
  10: No comprehensive assessment of the health implications of climate change at
    the national and subnation level in the three countries (Canada, US, Mexico) despite
    the cascading effect of the health implications of climate change and the economic
    and social consequences.
  12: The risk that climate change poses to infrastructure could alter the incentives
    for both private and public infrastructure investment, as well as the types of
    infrastructure that should be funded.
  14: Key economic sectors, financial markets, government budgets, and household welfare
    are unevenly affected by climate impacts in North America. High exposure or sensitivity
    to climate impacts in economic sectors mentioned above have experienced larger
    losses and adaptation costs.
  15: Declining yields in economic activities, aggravating conditions in social wellbeing,
    and increasing degradation of ecosystem caused by climate change
Quantitative material:
  6: No relevant information
  7: Storms are the primary cause of weather-related losses, accounting for 805 billion
    US dollars in total losses since 1980 and 454 billion US dollars in insured losses;
    Severe thunderstorms were responsible for 43% (or US$ 180 billion) of insured
    property windstorm damages between 1980 and 2011 only in the US; Total losses
    from severe weather events increased by 15% (US$ 160 billion), with heat waves,
    droughts, and wildfires accounting for more than half of this.
  8: No quantitative information.
  12: Direct economic costs of all extreme events reached 210-268 billion USD in 2020
    in North America.
