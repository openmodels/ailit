Drivers of Risk:
  1: Rising temperatures, droughts, extreme rainfall, rising sea levels, increasing
    frequency and severity of extreme events.
  2: Increased mean temperature, precipitation, and soil humidity. Increase in extreme
    events (heat waves, drought, extreme precipitation, hurricanes). Increase in compound
    extreme events (droughts and heatwaves).
  3: Adaptation challenges and vulnerabilities in societies and ecosystems due to
    climate change impacts.
  4: Shifted rainfall patterns and dramatic warming in the Arctic.
  5: Increasing global temperatures leading to higher maximum temperatures and fewer
    cold days; release of gases and fine particles (aerosols); extreme weather events,
    including floods, storms, droughts, heat waves, and wildfires.
  6: Extreme events (tropical storms, hurricanes, fires, heat waves), changes in temperature
    and precipitation, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification.
  7: Tropical cyclones (especially hurricanes with storm surge and high wind), thunderstorms,
    urban sprawl, heat waves, droughts, and wildfires, as well as changes in climate
    conditions.
  10: The paper discusses how temperature and precipitation changes impact water-borne
    diseases, acute respiratory tract infections, nutritional issues, dengue, and
    asthma (specifically in Mexico). Climatic events can be direct (heatwaves, hurricanes)
    or indirect (malnutrition, anxiety about climate change).
  11: Climate change leads to droughts, floods, altered temperatures and CO2 levels,
    heat waves, and water temperature changes.
  12: Climate-related disasters (e.g., cold waves, droughts, wildfires, floods, windstorms),
    sea level rise, and continued GHG emission through urbanization.
  14: Extreme events have damaged economically important supply-chain infrastructure
    and disrupted regional and international trade.
  15: Increasing global warming.

    America, especially considering infrastructure, economies, and population vulnerabilities.
  14: The paper summarizes implications of climate change for the economy, social
    wellbeing, and ecosystems in North America.
  15: Declining yields in economic activities, aggravating conditions in social wellbeing,
    and increasing degradation of ecosystem caused by climate change.
Highlights:
  1: Without immediate action, adaptation to climate change will be more difficult
    and costly, particularly for the most vulnerable social groups, economic activities,
    and ecosystems.
  2: Global warming is occurring faster than anticipated and is unprecedented in the
    last 2000 years. Every increase in global warming will cause more changes in temperature,
    precipitation, and soil humidity. Extreme events have increased since the 1950s
    and are projected to continue to increase. There is a small window of opportunity
    (10 years) to strengthen and enhance adaptation responses to climate change.
  3: IPCC highlights the small window of opportunity (approximately 10 years) to strengthen
    and enhance both mitigation and adaptation responses to climate change.
  4: North America has produced a greater share of greenhouse gas emissions over time
    than any other continent, largely due to the US.
  5: North America has seen severe damage to local economies, ecosystems, and social
    systems from recent extreme weather. Extreme weather events are happening with
    major frequency. Settlement continues to accelerate along coasts, increasing the
    monetary value of the property at risk.
  6: Extreme events are increasing in frequency and intensity in North America, posing
    significant threats. Agriculture and food security are facing severe impacts due
    to changes in temperature and precipitation.
  7: Adaptation to tropical storm impacts is essential due to significant risk to
    economic infrastructure, sectors, social wellbeing and security, and fatalities.
    Thunderstorms represent the most significant severe weather danger. Extremely
    dry and hot weather will occur more frequently due to climate change. The West
    part of the U.S. and Northern Mexico will suffer longer and more intense droughts
    together with extreme temperature in coming decades putting significant stress
    on ecosystems, the economy, social wellbeing, and water resources.
  10: The paper highlights the need for broader attention to the health dimension
    of climate change in Mexico, particularly regarding mental health.
  11: Climate change may make it more challenging to cultivate crops, raise livestock,
    and catch fish in the same locations and ways as in the past. Infrastructure is
    vulnerable to climate change, leading to significant economic and social consequences.
  12: A number of small and medium size cities, particularly in Mexico, do not have
    adaptation plans and there is a gap between financial support invested and needed.
  15: Attention to adaptation continue to be limited, short-term focused, fragmented
    or even inexistent in many cases. Scientific evidence seems to have had limited
    impact in decision making by significant parts of the public, private and social
    sector. Current trends and increasing global warming will continue to limit options
    to adapt to climate change and increase their cost. Negative consequences of inaction
    are already high in the region, and they will continue to increase, particularly
    for the most vulnerable groups.
Methodology:
  1: Reflection on evidence produced by Working Group 2 of the IPCC AR6 report. Evaluation
    methods based on impacts and adaptation assessments revised in available literature.
  2: This paper summarizes key messages from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Reports and
    presents selected data and information of North America as a context.
  3: No relevant information
  11: The page discusses projected impacts under RCP8.5 scenarios, with specific time
    horizons like 2050 and 2090 mentioned in cited studies.
More Notes:
  1: The paper suggests a need for deeper investigation into subnational climate change
    impacts, particularly in Mexico.
  2: The paper focuses on climate change implications in North America and its economic
    dimensions, viewing it through the lens of the IPCC AR6 report.
  3: No relevant information
  4: The text describes the diverse climate zones and weather patterns across North
    America.
  5: Indigenous people and urban areas will remain more vulnerable than others to
    climate-change impacts. Coastal development and precipitations due to increase
    storms and hurricanes will interact with climate change impacts to stress coastal
    communities and habitats. Major changes are also occurring in the ecosystems and
    vegetations of the region and strong impacts are expected to occur in Western
    US, North and Southeast of Mexico, and the Artic Canada.

  5: Northern Mexico could experience an increase in average annual temperatures of
    3 to 4 degrees Celsius by the end of this century.
  6: Extreme events have increased in frequency and intensity. Corn, sugar cane, sorghum,
    wheat, rice, soybeans yields may drop (5-20% next decades and 80% by the end of
    the century). Several states in Mexico could lose between 30 and 40% of their
    seasonal corn production yields. Sea levels can rise between 20, 40 or even 60
    centimeters. A decrease in pH of 0.5 has been observed in the Pacific coast.
  7: "Storms are the primary cause of weather-related losses, accounting for 805 billion\
    \ US dollars in total losses since 1980 and, thanks to strong insurance penetration,\
    \ 454 billion US dollars in insured losses. Severe thunderstorms were responsible\
    \ for 43% (or US$ 180 billion) of insured property windstorm damages between 1980\
    \ and 2011 only in the US. The total losses from severe weather events increased\
    \ by 15% (US$ 160 billion), with heat waves, droughts, and wildfires accounting\
    \ for more than half of this. 2012, with a mean temperature 3.8\xB0F (2.1\xB0\
    C) above the norm for the 20th century, has been the warmest year in the US thus\
    \ far (including September) since the start of weather records in 1895."

  12: Flooding has increased on average by 233% only in the US in the past 20 years;
    sea level has increased by 20 cm since 1950, almost half of that increase is in
    the past 20 years; climate finance invested in urban areas is $384 billion per
    year, approximately 10% needed for low-carbon and resilient urban development;
    delaying actions for increasing the resilience of urban infrastructure from 2020
    to 2030 is estimated to have a median cost of at least USD 1 trillion.
