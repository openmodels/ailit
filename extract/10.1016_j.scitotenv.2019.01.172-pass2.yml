Drivers of Risk:
  1: Large- and local-scale climate
  2: "El Ni\xF1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Sea\
    \ surface temperature anomalies (SSTa), air temperature anomalies (ATa), Palmer\
    \ Drought Severity Index (PDSI)"
  4: Climate (relationship between crop yields and climate is studied)
  6: Large-scale climatic patterns and modes of crop yield variability.
  14: Local climate variability, average temperature anomalies (ATA), Palmer Drought
    Severity Index (PDSI).
  15: Global drivers of atmospheric variability such as ENSO or NAO influence local
    climate and can trigger simultaneous impacts on croplands.
  22: The analysis implicitly connects climate change (through impacts on crop yields)
    to correlations between principal components of crop yields (maize, soybean, rice,
    sorghum).

Highlights:
  2: Large-scale climate, especially ENSO and NAO, are strongly correlated with crop
    yield variability; Local climate variability influences maize harvesting regions
    in Europe, rice and soybean in South America, and sorghum in North America; Sorghum
    yield variability across the globe exhibits significant correlations with many
    atmospheric and oceanic indices; Same crops in many countries co-vary significantly,
    and different crops in different PCs also co-vary with other crops
  4: Identifies co-varying crop producers and joint dependencies between crops.
  11: A great deal of global yields variability of sorghum and soybean anomalies happen
    in a limited number of co-
  14: Maize croplands in several countries are impacted by local climate. Rice, sorghum
    and soybean crops have impacts as well, across global regions. Major exporters
    (ME) and major importers (MI) co-vary conversely in different PCs.
  22: The analysis finds both positive and negative correlations between principal
    components of different crop yields. Specific examples include correlation = 0.40
    between rice-PC1 and maize-PC1, correlation = -0.53 between rice-PC3 and maize-PC1,
    correlation = 0.64 between rice-PC3 and (an unspecified) other variable, and correlation
    = -0.39 between soybean-PC1 and maize-PC1.

Methodology:
  2: Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) to decompose long-term national-based
    yields of maize, rice, sorghum and soybean from 1961 to 2013; Analysis of the
    association between the principal components (PC) of yield anomalies and climate
  4: Uses Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) to decompose yield time series
    of maize, rice, sorghum and soybean (MRSS) from 1961 to 2013 to assess the association
    between crop yields and climate more accurately.
  6: The study uses multiple monthly atmospheric and ocean time series (NOAA-ESRL,
    2017) to study links between climatic patterns and crop yield variability. Irrigated
    and rain fed maps for each crop combined to obtain the global spatial coverage
    of MRSS croplands, the spatial coverage of croplands is specified for countries
    of this study impacted by local climate variability.
  7: The data matrix M represents yield anomalies over time (1964-2010) and across
    countries.
  11: Concurrent (one-year lag) correlation between the PC1, PC2 and PC3 of maize,
    rice, sorghum and soybean and SSTa and ATa/PDSI over croplands from 1964 to 2010
    (1963-2009).
  14: Analysis of Principal Components (PC1, PC2, PC3) of climate variability and
    PDSI impact on crop yields. Bar charts show the percentages of MRSS croplands
    in 10 global regions affected.
  22: The analysis uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on crop yields and Spearman
    correlation to assess relationships between these PCs. The correlations are assessed
    with a 95% confidence interval.
  25: Uses Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and plans to investigate the
    association of the sparse matrix resulting from RPCA with climate.

More Notes:
  1: This paper focuses on crop yields and their relationship to climate, which can
    be an input into macroeconomic models assessing climate change impacts. However,
    it doesn't directly quantify macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  2: The study focuses on identifying the association between climate and crop yield
    variability and recognizing similar and dissimilar countries in terms of yield
    fluctuations, which can be informative for nations regarding the periodic and
    predictable nature of large-scale climatic patterns.
  4: Focuses on countries with complete yield data from 1961 to 2013 from the Food
    and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations statistical databases (FAO,
    2016).
  14: The analysis identifies specific countries that are major exporters and major
    importers of crops and their relationships.
  15: The text suggests that free trade can be part of the solution to global food
    security and improve sustainable use of natural resources.
  22: The page focuses on the statistical relationships between different crop yields
    represented by their principal components, but it does not explicitly link these
    relationships to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes. The principal components
    may represent underlying climate or weather factors that are impacting crop yields
    in correlated ways.
  25: The study aims to enhance knowledge of the global food security field and is
    relevant to policy initiatives, decision-makers, and various organizations. The
    project was supported and monitored by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    (NOAA).
