Drivers of Risk:
  1: Ozone impacts on yield and quality of crops and pastures, precursor emissions,
    atmospheric transport, leaf uptake, plant's biochemical defence capacity, changing
    climatic conditions, increasing atmospheric CO2, altered emission patterns, heat,
    drought
  3: Ozone formation from atmospheric transport and destruction, influenced by turbulent
    diffusion, surface destruction and stomatal conductance; increasing temperatures;
    rate of reactions with biomolecules.
  15: Elevated ozone concentrations in regions with rapid industrialization and population
    growth and limited regulations, exacerbated by climate change-induced warming.
Highlights:
  1: Elevated mean ozone levels are projected for 2050 and beyond in many cropland
    regions, potentially causing negative impacts on major staple crops such as rice
    and wheat.
  3: Elevated ozone levels cause significant crop yield losses, particularly in wheat,
    soybean, corn, and rice, and these losses are expected to increase. The CO2 protection
    from ozone effects also becomes less effective with increasing temperature.
  15: Ozone risks for crops and pastures depend on exposure, leaf uptake, and plant
    defence capacity, all of which are likely to change with changing anthropogenic
    emissions and climatic conditions. The negative impact of ozone on stable soil
    C pools could be aggravated by higher temperatures.
Methodology:
  3: The paper discusses experiments and meta-analyses of data related to ozone exposure
    and crop yields and also details a risk assessment approach.
  15: Simulation with biogeochemical models, though uncertainties exist with model
    parameters. The models simulate the direct effects of ozone on photosynthesis
    and indirect effects on stomatal conductance (gs).
More Notes:
  3: The paper mentions how ozone concentration results from ozone formation, atmospheric
    transport and destruction.  The effective dose of ozone that causes damage to
    cellular components depends on the rate of reactions with biomolecules (ROS reactive
    oxygen species).
  15: Crop improvement through varieties with improved tolerance to oxidative stress
    caused by ozone could help limit crop losses and increase food security. Older
    varieties could be a source of more ozone-tolerant material due to lower gs, higher
    antioxidative capacity, and higher levels of dark respiration.

  20: This page primarily contains a list of scientific publications related to the
    effects of climate change (particularly ozone and CO2) on plants and ecosystems.
    It does not contain any information about macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes,
    or the costs and benefits of adaptation at a national level. It focuses on biological
    and environmental impacts, rather than economic ones.
  22: This page consists of a list of references and does not contain original research
    or analysis directly relevant to the specified categories.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Food security
  3: Crop yield losses (wheat, soybean, corn, rice, potato) due to ozone exposure.
  15: Reduced grain weight in cereals due to ozone-induced accelerated senescence,
    leading to potential productivity losses.
Quantitative material:
  3: In China, Japan, and South Korea, 1-9% of wheat, rice, and corn yields, and 23-27%
    of soybean yields were lost due to 1990 ozone levels, with losses potentially
    exceeding 30% by 2020. Crop loss in wheat was 20% to 30% in 1999/2000 in the United
    States and Europe.
  15: No quantitative information provided on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
