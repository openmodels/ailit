  7: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate-driven change in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, increased shelf-slope
    salinity stratification, modified North Atlantic and Arctic circulation and salinity,
    changes in oceanic haline stratification and gyre structure, disruption of the
    density-driven circulation of the North Sea.
  7: Increasing stratification and density gradient along the slope in the Faeroe-Shetland
    channel affecting the slope current and water transport in the Norwegian Trench.
Highlights:
  2: Climate change in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans can greatly reduce the
    circulation of the North Sea, leading to a more estuarine environment with enhanced
    nutrient content and primary production, and wide-ranging environmental management
    and societal impacts.
  7: Relaxation of topographic steering leads to reduction in the West Norwegian Trench
    (WNT). A positive feedback loop involving increased freshwater transport from
    continental Europe can lead to a new state of North Sea circulation. An acceleration
    of the slope current may mitigate the decrease of WNT.
Methodology:
  2: Downscaling experiments using a high-resolution shelf sea model to demonstrate
    how end-of-century changes in the wider ocean can lead to a substantial reduction
    in the flow of water from the North Atlantic into the North Sea.
  7: Oceanographic modeling experiments (E1, E2, E3) are used to project changes in
    density, currents, and water transport into the future (2070-2099) compared to
    a present period (1980-2009). The geostrophic decomposition is also used.
More Notes:
  2: The paper identifies a novel potential future state for the North Sea, with implications
    for environmental management and societal impacts, emphasizing the need to better
    understand the many ways climate change can influence the marine environment and
    its ecosystems.
  7: The study appears to focus on changes in ocean dynamics but may imply impacts
    on coastal communities or fisheries if these ocean circulation changes influence
    weather patterns or marine ecosystems; any such knock on effects are not mentioned.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Enhanced risk of coastal eutrophication, potential disturbances to marine ecosystems
    (e.g., oxygen depletion), disrupted transport of larvae, increased retention of
    pollutants.
Quantitative material:
  2: "Northern North Sea inflow decreases from 1.2\u20131.3 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3/s) to\
    \ 0.0\u20130.6 Sv."
  7: The nonlocal geostrophic component (Qgr) of the West Norwegian Trench (WNT) decreases
    from 0.51 Sv to 0.12 Sv in experiment E1 and from 0.50 to 0.16 Sv in E2. The local
    geostrophic current is 0.12 Sv in E1, increasing to 0.26 Sv in the future.  In
    E2, Qgr increases from 0.09 to 0.15 Sv.
