Drivers of Risk:
  2: Natural disasters (unspecified types) in Sri Lanka.
  3: Natural disasters (cyclones, droughts, epidemics, floods, gales, heavy rains,
    landslides, land subsidence, plagues, storms, strong winds, surges, tornados,
    and tsunami)
  4: Natural disasters, measured as the percentage of population affected.
  5: Natural disasters have a significant negative correlation with income inequality,
    suggesting possible reductions in inequality as a result of these events.
  8: Natural disasters (measured by the number of people affected)
  10: Natural disasters (measured as % of population affected)
  12: Natural disasters (disaggregated and lagged)
  14: Biological disasters, Climatic disasters, Geophysical disasters, Hydrological
    disasters, Meteorological disasters, Disaster (% Population Affected), Disaster_lag1,
    Disaster_lag2, Disaster_lag3, Disaster_lag4, Disaster_lag5
Highlights:
  2: Natural disasters decrease income inequality among Sri Lankan households; natural
    disasters decrease non-seasonal agricultural and non-agricultural income inequality
    but increase seasonal agricultural income inequality; natural disasters do not
    affect household expenditure inequality.
  3: Natural disasters may negatively affect the level of income of the poor leading
    to a widened income inequality in society; disaster affected territories generally
    suffer economic damages by way of human and physical capital losses which usually
    cause declines in average incomes leading to spatial disparities in average incomes
    ultimately increasing income inequality among individuals within the same economy.
  4: Disasters affect a significant percentage of the population in Sri Lanka. There
    is substantial variation of inequality among districts in Sri Lanka.
  5: The study suggests a significant negative correlation between natural disasters
    and income inequality, indicating that disasters might reduce income inequality.
  8: Natural disasters have a statistically significant negative impact on income
    inequality in the short term (same year, two years, and three years prior) but
    a positive impact after four years. The negative impact is driven by a reduction
    in non-agricultural income inequality and non-seasonal agricultural income inequality.
  10: Natural disasters and their immediate lags generally reduce income inequality,
    as measured by various metrics.
  12: Table 11 shows that the impact of disasters (% Pop. Affected) on income inequality
    is statistically significant and positive for the FE, OLS, and Sys. GMM estimators.
    Table 12 suggests that contemporaneous and lagged disasters have a statistically
    significant impact on mean household income and income quantiles. Table 13 indicates
    that the impact of disasters and lagged disasters on expenditure inequality is
    generally not statistically significant.
  14: Natural disasters lead to lesser income inequality, but the reduction in income
    inequality was not derived through enhanced receipts or remittances. Disasters
    decreased non-seasonal agricultural income inequality and non-agricultural income
    inequality, but increased seasonal agricultural income inequality. When the rich
    suffer greater losses in profits and income due to disasters, household income
    inequality would decrease, however, at the expense of the rich.
Methodology:
  2: Panel fixed effects estimator using a unique panel data set constructed for the
    paper, based on household income reported in six waves of the Household Income
    and Expenditure Survey of Sri Lanka during the period between 1990 and 2013, and
    data on disaster-affected population and other economic and social indicators.
  3: District-wise annual disaster database for Sri Lanka from 1985 to 2013, Income
    data and other social and economic indicators from the Household Income and Expenditure
    Survey (HIES) series conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics of Sri
    Lanka from 1990 to 2013.
  4: Panel data analysis using household income and expenditure survey (HIES) data
    for 25 administrative districts in Sri Lanka over six survey time periods. The
    study uses the OECD modified equivalence scale to adjust incomes for household
    size and composition. The analysis explores the impact of natural disasters on
    income inequality at the district level.
  5: The analysis is performed using a panel regression estimator with district and
    time fixed effects, aiming to reduce any potential endogeneity issues.
  8: Panel regression analysis of district-level inequality measures with disaster
    data and district and time fixed effects. Errors are clustered at the district
    level. Data covers six waves of surveys.
  10: Panel data regression with district and time fixed effects, errors clustered
    at the district level; balanced panel of 17 districts in some regressions and
    six waves of surveys; alternative estimators like OLS and difference/system GMM
    used to address simultaneity.
  12: Panel data regressions with district and time fixed effects; Fixed Effects (FE),
    Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Difference Generalized Method of Moments (GMM),
    and System GMM estimators; Data covers six waves of surveys with contemporaneous
    and lagged disaster data; Errors clustered at the district level.
  14: Panel data analysis of district-level measures for six waves of surveys. Models
    include a constant term, district and time fixed effects. Errors clustered at
    the district level. Robust standard errors are used.
More Notes:
  2: Income of richer households is mainly derived from non-agricultural sources such
    as manufacturing and business activities and non-seasonal agricultural activities,
    while poorer households have a higher share of agricultural income.
  3: Data are representative at district level, but are not panel data. The only wave
    which covers the entire country is the 2012/13 survey.
  4: The study normalizes the disaster variable as the percentage of population affected
    because economic data may be gathered by individuals who lack the expertise to
    estimate economic loss, and severe disasters may not kill. The study considers
    monetary and non-monetary income in calculations.
  10: The relationship between disasters and inequality is complex and varies depending
    on the measure of inequality, the timing of the disaster (current vs. lagged),
    and the inclusion of control variables. The authors address potential endogeneity
    by using alternative estimators. The results are specific to the districts and
    time periods analyzed in the study.
  12: Disasters are categorized into biological, climatic, geophysical, hydrological,
    and meteorological types according to EM-DAT definitions.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Impact of natural disasters on income inequality in Sri Lanka, measured by the
    Theil index and other inequality metrics.
  3: Average incomes, income inequality among individuals within the same economy.
  4: Income inequality (measured by Theil index, Gini coefficient, inter quartile
    range, and inter quintile range), mean and median household incomes, and poverty
    rates.
  8: Income inequality (measured by Theil index)
  10: Income inequality (measured by Theil index, Gini coefficient, inter quintile
    range (IQ5R), and inter quartile range (IQ4R))
  12: Income inequality (Theil, Gini), Household income (logged), Expenditure inequality
    (Theil, Gini)
  14: Household Income (logged), Income inequality (Theil)
Quantitative material:
  2: Contemporaneous natural disasters and their immediate lags significantly and
    substantially decrease inequality in per adult equivalent household income as
    measured by the Theil index.
  4: On average, disasters affect 5% of the population in a district per annum in
    Sri Lanka; maximum percentage of population affected by natural disasters in a
    district can be as high as 118%; district-wise income inequality measured by Theil
    index is around 0.44; Gini co-efficient is around 0.43; per adult equivalent real
    mean household income is Rs. 8891 (in constant 2006 rupees); the income of the
    richest quintile is more than 10 folds larger compared to the poorest quintile;
    average household size is around 4; about 15% of households are poor.
  8: An increase of current disaster affected population by one percentage point would
    reduce income inequality measured by Theil index by 0.0062 points. Natural disasters
    negatively impact total income inequality in the same year, two years, and three
    years prior to the survey, but positive impacts are seen after four years. The
    disaggregated impacts on different components of income are also measured.
  10: Natural disasters (% of population affected) have a statistically significant
    impact on income inequality, with current and lagged disaster variables showing
    both positive and negative coefficients depending on the inequality metric used.
    E.g., Disaster (% Pop. Affected) /C0 0.00139*** on Gini coefficient.
  12: Regression results in Tables 11, 12, and 13 present coefficient estimates, standard
    errors, R-squared, and number of observations/districts for the impact of natural
    disasters on income inequality, household income, and expenditure inequality.
  14: Table 16 shows the effect of different disaster sub-groups on household income
    (logged) across income quintiles (Mean, Median, Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5) with coefficient
    estimates and standard errors. Table 17 shows the effect of disasters (excluding
    meteorological) and lagged disasters on income inequality (Theil) with coefficient
    estimates and standard errors.
