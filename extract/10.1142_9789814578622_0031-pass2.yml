Drivers of Risk:
  9: Water flow, Water level, Salinity
  10: Climate-induced changes in sea level, temperature, rainfall, and altered riverine
    flows from the Himalayas leading to increased spread and intensity of salinization
    on river water in coastal areas; worsening saltwater intrusion in low-lying coastal
    areas.
  14: River salinity changes in the southwest coastal area of Bangladesh due to climate
    change.
  15: 'Increasing land salinity, classified into four categories: Slight Saline (<1
    dS/m), Slight to Moderately Saline (1-5 dS/m), Moderate to High saline (5-10 dS/m),
    and Highly Saline (>10 dS/m).'
  17: Climate change leading to salinity intrusion in the coastal zone of Bangladesh.
  21: Climate change leading to increased salinity in rivers and water scarcity.
  24: Changes in river salinity
  26: Sea-level rise causing salinity intrusion in coastal areas.
Highlights:
  9: The model shows a strong correlation with measured data for water flow, water
    level, and salinity at multiple locations (high R2 values). The strongest correlation
    is between model and measured data for Pussur River salinity at Mongla (R2 = 0.99).
  10: None
  14: The worst future scenario is A2 emission with 67cm RMSLR, leading to the largest
    increase in salinity.
  15: The area classified as 'Moderate to High saline' could increase from 8% in 2012
    to 17% ('Best') or 27% ('Worst') in 2050. The area classified as 'Slight to Moderately
    Saline' could decrease from 35% in 2012 to 30% ('Best') or 21% ('Worst') in 2050.
  17: Projected salinity intrusion in coastal Bangladesh under a specific climate
    change scenario (B1) significantly impacts coastal agriculture, ecosystems, and
    livelihoods.
  21: River water will no longer be utilizable for agriculture in several districts
    in the worst-case scenario; severe scarcity is expected even in the best-case
    scenario in some regions.
Methodology:
  9: Model-generated results were compared to measured data.
  10: None
  14: Analysis of salinity intrusion based on RMSLR scenarios and emission scenarios
    (B1 and A2).
  15: The analysis projects changes in land salinity over time, comparing a baseline
    scenario to 'Best' and 'Worst' case scenarios for 2050.
  17: The projection is for the year 2050 under the B1 emission scenario. Isohalines
    are modeled and mapped for the Southwest region of Bangladesh.
  26: Detailed, country-level assessments of potential impacts of climate change on
    salinity are mentioned as a potential outcome.
More Notes:
  9: The images are all black and provide no additional information.
  10: The information provided is qualitative, describing the drivers of risk related
    to climate change and its impact on river water salinity but without providing
    specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes or adaptation costs/benefits. The paper
    is only describing the likely physical impacts of climate change in a specific
    area.
  15: The completely black images do not provide any additional information.
  17: The analysis appears to be based on modeling performed by University of Waterloo
    and CEGIS. The image labelled completely black are considered irrelevant to information
    extraction.
  24: Identifies Bagerhat, Barguna, Bhola, Khulna, Patuakhali, and Satkhira Districts
    as high poverty areas requiring further analysis.
  26: The analysis is intended to raise awareness and prompt countries to initiate
    detailed assessments and actions related to climate risks and adaptation.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  9: No relevant information
  10: None
  15: The paper implicitly addresses productivity loss by estimating changes in land
    salinity, which can impact agricultural yields and thus, economic output.
  17: The map depicts a significant predicted impact of salinity intrusion on coastal
    agriculture, ecosystems, and livelihoods.
  21: Impacts on agriculture due to water scarcity and salinity intrusion, potentially
    affecting agricultural productivity and GDP.
  24: Location-specific economic impacts of changes in river salinity; costing of
    adaptation alternatives
  26: Socioeconomic impacts of salinity changes in coastal areas; Protecting or facilitating
    increased resilience of coastal assets and activities.
Quantitative material:
  9: R2 values for the comparison of water flow, water level, and salinity at various
    locations in Bangladesh. R2 ranges from 0.73 to 0.99.
  10: None
  15: The paper provides quantitative estimates of the percentage of land area falling
    into different salinity classifications for a baseline year (March 2012) and two
    scenarios (Best and Worst) for March 2050.
  17: Salinity contours are provided at 2 ppt, 5 ppt, 10 ppt, 20 ppt, and 25 ppt;
    RMSLR of 35 cm; local subsidence rate of 2mm/year; Map scale bar shows 0 to 60
    km.
  21: Salinity exceeding 2ppt in Tentulia River, 98 percent of rivers in Khulna and
    97 percent of rivers in Bhola adversely affected (in a scenario), salinity lower
    than 2ppt in Bishkhali River, Buriswar River, and the upstream stretch of the
    Baleswar River.
