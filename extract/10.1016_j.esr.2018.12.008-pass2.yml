Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on runoff availability for hydropower generation; Constraints
    on hydropower deployment.
  3: Climate change impacts are limited to their effect on hydropower supply in this
    analysis. The study considers socio-economic drivers (population, households,
    and GDP) and demand elasticities in five end-use sectors.
  4: Environmental conservation concerns, social problems and accessibility issues
    can restrict hydropower development.
  5: Climate change impacts on hydropower potential due to changes in river flow patterns,
    impacting electricity production.
  9: Climate change (specifically, changes in rainfall leading to wet and dry scenarios)
    and policy decisions (Boost Hydropower vs. Constrain Hydropower).
  10: The variability in hydropower output due to dry and wet climate scenarios is
    a primary driver of risk for electricity generation and emissions.
  11: Climate change (Wet, Mean, Dry scenarios), Policy decisions (HydropowerBoost,
    HydropowerConstrain, Environment Priority).
Highlights:
  1: Hydropower will remain one of the most cost-effective and low emission technologies
    in the Ecuadorian power sector in the long-term. Climate change impacts could
    hinder its ability to contribute to the fulfillment of NDC targets.
  9: Hydropower's contribution to electricity supply is highly sensitive to climate
    change and policy choices. Constraining hydropower development can lead to increased
    reliance on natural gas, with potential implications for energy security. A limitation
    of the study is the time scale resolution of TIMES-EC does not allow the full
    value of DAM hydropower flexibility to be captured.
  10: Emission levels are highly sensitive to climate scenarios with restrictions
    on large hydropower, leading to significant emission increases, particularly in
    dry scenarios where emissions could rise almost sevenfold compared to Ecuador's
    NDC.
  11: The choice of policy case has a greater impact on electricity prices than future
    variations in climate. The Constrain Hydropower policy case is the cheapest option
    but may bring significant implications for future GHG emissions. The Environment
    Priority case is the most expensive from an average generation cost perspective
    but offers a generation matrix capable of maintaining low emissions consistent
    with Ecuador's current NDC. The Boost Hydropower policy is the most capital-intensive.
Methodology:
  1: Climate change scenarios from a large ensemble of Global Circulation Models are
    used as input for an energy system optimisation model (TIMES-EC) to examine least-cost
    options for the hydropower-dominated Ecuadorian power system to 2050, considering
    trade-offs between power system configuration, emissions and costs.
  3: The paper uses the TIMES-EC model, a bottom-up optimisation modelling platform,
    to examine investment decisions and evaluate how energy and environmental policies
    impact the energy sector over a multi-decadal time horizon (2015-2050, with calibration
    from 2014-2017 and extension to 2085 for long-term effects).
  4: The Ecuadorian national Electrification Master Plan (PME) estimated the techno-economically
    feasible hydropower potential. The TIMES-EC model is used for analysis, informed
    by cost data and efficiencies from various sources, including observed costs of
    plants installed in Ecuador during the last decade.
  5: The TIMES-EC model is used to model hydropower potential, including run-of-river
    and reservoir plants, with availability factors to constrain electricity production.
    The model includes discrete investment features for new capacity additions for
    hydropower projects. The model considers different technologies and their availability
    factors.
  9: The analysis uses the TIMES-EC model to project energy scenarios from 2015 to
    2050 under different climate and policy assumptions.
  10: The analysis is performed using the TIMES-EC model simulating future scenarios
    to project emissions and energy mix under varied climate and policy conditions.
  11: The analysis uses the TIMES-EC model to explore the impact of future policy
    decisions and variations in hydropower production associated with climate change
    on electricity system costs. Results are applicable for the period 2015-2050 and
    are in $US2015.
More Notes:
  1: Strategies to hedge against these risks likely require that hydropower expansion
    be complemented by alternative sources such as thermoelectric generation with
    natural gas, biomass and geothermal energy.
  5: The model constrains investments in large hydropower in steps based on the river
    basin potential and number of projects. Retirement profile of existing hydropower
    stations are computed using a plant lifetime of 75 years. Solar and wind potential
    are also considered with their variability represented through peak load contribution.
    Geothermal and bioenergy potentials are also included, although geothermal capacity
    is currently not installed.
  9: The study highlights a potential trade-off between hydropower development and
    reliance on natural gas for electricity generation, with energy security implications
    for Ecuador.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Uncertainty around long-term power system costs.
  9: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes are mentioned, but the paper discusses
    the share of electricity demand supplied by hydropower, electricity generation
    levels, and energy security implications.
  11: Average long-term electricity generation cost, average marginal cost, and cumulative
    investment costs related to electricity generation in Ecuador from 2015-2050.
Quantitative material:
  3: "The model considers GDP growth, with an average annual growth rate of 2.7% and\
    \ a population annual average growth rate of 0.67%. The annual discount rate is\
    \ set to 8%. Oil prices are based on the U.S. Department of Energy \u2013 Annual\
    \ Energy Outlook 2017 reference scenario, which considers long-term prices for\
    \ oil to be 110 US$/barrel by 2050."
  4: Ecuador's installed power capacity in 2017 was 6739 MW, a 91% increase since
    2007 (3526 MW). Hydropower potential is estimated at 13,002 MW. Other renewables
    (wind, solar, biomass, land fill gas) have a potential of 2677.6 PJ/y.
  5: Ecuador has 4.4 GW of installed hydropower capacity, 0.7 GW under construction,
    and 13 GW of remaining potential.
  9: The share of electricity demand supplied by hydropower generation ranges from
    62% up to 86% in 2050 under the Boost Hydropower policy and 29% up to 62% under
    the Constrain Hydropower policy. Hydropower output variability can range from
    +21% to -44% compared to the NoCC scenario under the Constrain Hydropower policy.
  10: "Cumulative electricity-related GHG emissions for 2015\u20132050 range from\
    \ 48 GtCO2e to 350 GtCO2e across different scenarios."
  11: "Figure 7 presents quantitative data on average generation cost (US\xA2/kWh),\
    \ average marginal cost (Billion US$), and cumulative investment (Billion US$)\
    \ for different policy cases and climate change scenarios. For example, the Boost\
    \ Hydropower policy case has a cumulative investment of around US$65 billion,\
    \ while the Constrain Hydropower case is around US$35 billion."
