Drivers of Risk:
  1: Natural hazards related to climate change including wind storms, extreme waves,
    high and low sea levels, ice ridging, heavy precipitation, sea-effect snowfall,
    river floods, heat waves, ice seasons, drought, phytoplankton blooms, forest fires,
    and coastal flooding.
  16: Global warming and large-scale and regional changes in the water cycle affect
    flood risks. Scale of spring floods affected by precipitation, snow-water accumulation
    prior to freshet, depth of frozen soil, soil wetness since the previous autumn,
    the presence of ice crust before flooding, and the combination of flood waves.
  20: Sea ice extremes depend on the temporal and spatial scale under consideration
    and, more importantly, on the geographical location and climate conditions; Ice
    ridging; Sea ice compression or internal stress depends on the strength of wind
    and currents but also on ice thickness, floe geometry, and the cumulative area
    of the coherent ice region in motion; Severe ice winters due to a negative NAO.
  22: Global warming and increased freshwater inflow projected in the north of the
    Baltic area intensify stratification and support cyanobacteria blooms; wind-induced
    upwelling in early summer induces blooms due to phosphorus input; disruption of
    stratification by wind can collapse cyanobacteria blooms.
  23: Extreme events and projected changes caused by global warming or changes in
    the atmospheric circulation.
  26: Extreme water levels and coastal flooding due to climate change.
  31: Changes in mean sea level, wind climate, storm tracks, and circulation patterns;
    increase in shallow and moderate cyclones; warmer summers; changes in blocking
    patterns; stronger precipitation extremes.
Highlights:
  1: Natural hazards may have severe implications for human life and can potentially
    generate economic losses and damage ecosystems. A better understanding of their
    major causes, probability of occurrence, and consequences enables society to be
    better prepared to save human lives as well as to invest in adaptation options.
  20: Sea ice extent and thickness are projected to decrease markedly in the Baltic;
    It is also expected that the occurrence of severe ice winters will decrease and,
    consequently, heavy ice ridging and compression events will become rare if wind
    conditions remain the same in the future.
  22: Cyanobacteria blooms became a common phenomenon as of the 1960s; blooms of toxic
    dinoflagellates have increasingly been observed in shallow coastal waters of the
    Baltic Sea; the growing season of phytoplankton in the Baltic Sea is extending.
  23: Climate change is increasing the probability of large forest fires in the Baltic
    Sea region, which could lead to boreal forests becoming a net source of carbon.
  26: Damage costs increase with flood height. Projections indicate significant economic
    damage to Baltic countries by 2050 and 2100 from extreme water levels.
  31: Sea level extremes are expected to increase in a changing climate, leading to
    coastal flooding and destruction of property; warmer summers are linked to increased
    risk of drying and heatwaves; stronger precipitation extremes can have strong
    impacts on society, particularly in urban regions, leading to inland flooding.
Methodology:
  22: Analysis of phytoplankton biomass and Chl a concentrations at a coastal station
    in the Bay of Mecklenburg from 1988 to 2017 to determine trends in the duration
    of the vegetation period; long-term analyses including historical data to identify
    when cyanobacterial blooms became common
  23: Analysis performed by Krikken et al. (2021) was used to estimate the increase
    in probability of fire events due to climate change.
  31: Analysis based on trends in circulation patterns, cyclone activity, and precipitation
    extremes over recent decades.
More Notes:
  22: No relevant information
  26: The paper uses the MIUU model to calculate wind speeds for wind energy applications,
    but it is not directly connected to the damage cost curves.
  31: The paper focuses on the Baltic Sea region. The diagram illustrates relationships
    between atmospheric, hydrological, and marine processes and their societal impacts,
    especially concerning the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).

  32: This page focuses on climate-related hazards in the Baltic Sea region and does
    not provide specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, quantitative economic information,
    or detail methodological analysis of national adaptation costs and benefits.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic losses
  16: River flooding affects more people worldwide than any other natural hazard.
  20: Economic losses to society can occur if sea ice freezing occurs in a region
    where marine traffic is operated by non-ice-class vessels; Compression and thick
    ice caused a total shutdown of marine traffic for several days; Sea ice compression
    can cause total stoppage or even damage to ships and vessels.
  22: No relevant information
  23: Forest fires can shift boreal forests from a carbon sink to a net source of
    carbon to the atmosphere, resulting in a positive climate feedback.
  26: The figure presents estimated damage cost curves for coastal flood events and
    expected annual damage (EAD) to Baltic countries from extreme water levels, indicating
    economic costs.
  31: Coastal flooding, destruction of property, traffic disruption, and impacts on
    recreation are mentioned as societal impacts related to extreme weather events.
Quantitative material:
  20: In the winter of 2011, 14 ship accidents occurred due to harsh ice conditions
    (compared to an average of one to five); During the period from 24 February to
    7 March 2011, 142 ice compression cases were reported in the Gulf of Bothnia,
    of which 25 reported severe compressions.
  22: "The period with satellite-estimated chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations of\
    \ at least 3mgm\u22123 has doubled from approximately 110d in 1998 to 220d in\
    \ 2013 in the central Baltic Sea; the start of the spring bloom is earlier, with\
    \ a rate of 1.4dyr\u22121, and a later end of the autumn bloom, with a rate of\
    \ 3.1dyr\u22121, leading to an extension of the growing season (from 1988-2017)."
  23: Climate change has increased the probability of events like the 2018 Swedish
    fires roughly by 10% to date.
  26: Damage costs for specific cities (Copenhagen, Helsinki) in EUR, and projected
    damage costs for Baltic countries (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Lithuania,
    Latvia, Poland, Sweden) in billions of EUR for 2050 and 2100 under low and high
    scenarios.
