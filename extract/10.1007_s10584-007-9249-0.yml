Drivers of Risk:
  3: Sub-seasonal rainfall variability; Timing of rainfall stress with critical crop
    development stages
  5: Climate change impacting cropping systems.
  10: Climate change
  14: Supporting institutions and macro-economic conditions that facilitate adaptation
  16: Temperature, Humidity, Soil type, Land-use pressure, Deforestation and associated
    carbon debt, Cost of inputs, e.g. fertiliser
Methodology:
  10: Ensemble yield simulation
  16: Crop Model, Linking natural and social science, Farmer decision-making
More Notes:
  3: The distorted image suggests a potential problem or error in the data or presentation,
    making interpretation difficult.
  5: The page acknowledges the importance of adaptive measures.
  14: The adaptive capacity of farmers is highlighted.
  16: The page links climate variables (temperature, humidity, soil type) to crop
    yields and farmer decision-making, suggesting an integrated approach to modelling
    the socio-economic impacts of climate change on agriculture. The images (cloud/rain,
    sun, wheat) reinforce the focus on agricultural impacts.
No relevant information:
  6: This page appears to be an uncorrected OCR output or a corrupted scan. The text
    is largely illegible and there is no directly attributable, clear, and usable
    information about macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks of climate change, or the
    costs and benefits of adaptation at a national level.
  11: No relevant information
  21: This page primarily discusses crop modeling methods and their characteristics,
    without providing direct quantitative estimates of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes
    related to climate change adaptation at a national level. It lacks information
    on GDP effects, fiscal balance impacts, or costs/benefits of adaptation strategies.
    The drivers of risk or relevant quantitative material are not addressed on this
    page.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Crop yield (kg/ha)
  5: Changes in yield, land use, and market mechanisms related to cropping systems.
  10: Crop yield
  14: Will climate change push farming beyond the coping range?
  16: Subsistence farming, Sale price of produce
Quantitative material:
  3: 'Obsh Model Yield (kg/ha) under varying rainfall conditions: 394mm rainfall yields
    901 kg/ha, 1059 kg/ha, or 1360 kg/ha depending on the year; 389mm rainfall yields
    844 kg/ha.'
  10: Percentage change in yield; Response to climate change, from over 180,000 crop
    simulations; Count
