Drivers of Risk:
  2: Changes in weather variables (vapor pressure deficit, wet day frequency, and
    temperature). Climate change in the mid-future.
  3: Temperature increase and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) are associated with millet
    yield loss; Increase in wet day frequency improves millet output.
  5: Average temperature (TEMP), wet day frequency (WDF), vapor pressure deficit (VPD).
  7: "Average Temperature (\xB0C), Average Wet Days Frequency (WDF), Average Vapor\
    \ Pressure Deficit (VPD) (kPa)"
  9: High temperature values reduce millet output marginally in the following year,
    but not the year after; VPD is negatively related to millet yield.
  10: Temperature (TEMP), Water Deficit Factor (WDF), Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD)
  11: Weather shocks in an MPA can affect yields due to free trading among contiguous
    MPAs.
  12: Changes in weather variables (precipitation, temperature, VPD) due to climate
    change.
  14: Amplified damage from warming and diminished benefits from reduced rainfall.
    Unmitigated warming. Flooding.

Highlights:
  2: Own-location weather variables have significant contemporaneous impacts on millet
    yield. Vapor pressure deficit, wet day frequency and temperature are important
    determinants of millet yield. Spatial and temporal spillovers exacerbate and attenuate
    wet day cumulative effect, respectively. Local crop production is affected by
    neighboring countries' production.
  3: Increase in temperature leads to significant millet yield loss in SSA. Poor countries
    are at the receiving end of the adverse effects of weather shocks on millet yield.
  9: Control for spatial effects indicates larger impacts of temperature and WDF on
    millet yield compared to non-spatial effects; indirect effects, though smaller,
    are not negligible.
  10: Temperature increase would adversely affect poor countries more than rich countries
    (weakly significant). The direct and indirect effects estimates using 4-NN spatial
    weights are not significantly different from those following the inverse distance
    matrix in baseline estimates.
  11: The study finds no evidence of adaptation affecting millet yield in SSA over
    the period of study and emphasizes that results should be interpreted cautiously.
  12: 'There is evidence of future regional warming from the GCMs. The trend in predicted
    WDF varies across the GCMs: PCM predicts an increase, while others predict a decrease.'
  14: Warming reduces millet yield, while increased wet days improve millet output.
    Accounting for spatial effects amplifies the effect of wet day frequency. No evidence
    of adaptation to gradual changes in climate over the period considered using national
    data and long differences approaches.

Methodology:
  2: "Spatial panel data approach for 1970\u20132016, spatio-temporal econometrics\
    \ techniques, forecast how crop production would respond to climate change."
  3: Spatio-temporal panel data model to control for the effect of space and time,
    including spatial lags of the dependent variable and regressors with errors clustered
    at location level, and temporal lags of the regressors.
  5: "The paper uses weather observations of millet main producing areas (MPAs) in\
    \ all countries in the sample by taking a simple average of all the grid cells\
    \ overlaying the MPAs and weighs the weather data by the proportion of area harvested\
    \ for each crop relative to the country\u2019s total land area to account for\
    \ heteroskedasticity."
  7: Panel data analysis including time trend and country fixed effects is used. Spatial
    autocorrelation is accounted for using inverse distance spatial weights matrix
    with cutoff at 910 km, 4-nearest neighbor (4-NN) spatial weights, and spatial
    weights based on the prevailing economic network. Models are re-estimated using
    different spatial weights matrix to check the robustness of results.
  9: The analysis uses spatial models, estimating direct and indirect effects of temperature,
    and analyzes temporal lag effects based on weather variables.
  10: Panel data analysis with spatial econometrics. Models include time trend and
    its quadratic term, spatial weight is inverse distance, with errors clustered
    at the MPA level. Robustness checks include different model specifications like
    linear time trend only, no time trend, dropping South Africa, adding 3 temporal
    lags, and using 4-NN as spatial weights. The analysis also considers the income
    classification of SSA countries and interacts this with temperature and WDF.
  11: The study uses long differences (LD) and flexible long differences (FLD) models
    to estimate the impact of average weather conditions on millet yield.
  12: "The authors use daily weather measures from three Global Climate Models (GCMs)\
    \ under the RCP 8.5 scenario for the period 2040-2069. They derive changes in\
    \ weather variables by differencing the projected average weather measures over\
    \ 2040-2069 for a given grid cell over that of a relevant historical (baseline)\
    \ period (1981\u20132010), re-calibrate the baseline model with inputs from bootstrapped\
    \ runs, and then integrate the predicted climatic changes into the response function\
    \ from Eq. (1) while controlling for statistical (or regression) uncertainty."
  14: "Spatio-temporal panel data model to estimate the effect of annual weather fluctuations\
    \ on millet yield in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) for 1970\u20132016. Uses region-specific\
    \ weather realizations from major production areas of millet producing countries."

More Notes:
  2: Focuses on sub-Saharan Africa and pearl millet yield.
  3: Analysis focuses on millet, but the analysis was extended to other cereal crops
    (results available on request). The study uses weather observations from each
    country's main production area (MPA). The growing season used is specific to each
    country.
  5: The authors are introducing vapor pressure deficit (VPD) as a new weather measure
    into the empirical literature of climate change impacts in Sub-Saharan Africa
    (SSA).
  7: The study focuses on the impact of weather fluctuations on millet yields, and
    intentionally excludes several controls (such as GDP and institutional measures)
    to avoid an 'over-controlling problem' due to their potential as outcomes of climate.
  10: Adaptation is a critical challenge of panel model analysis, as the use of country
    fixed effects and time trends absorbs long-run atmospheric conditions. The paper
    acknowledges that panel models assume that the relationship modeled remains unchanged
    even with climate change.
  14: The beneficial effect of CO2 on crop fertilization, not accounted for in this
    study, may attenuate the negative impact, but might not be significant for millet.
    Uncertainties in Global Climate Models (GCMs) projections should be considered
    when interpreting results.

  3: For a temperature increase of 2.3oC in the region, millet yield will go down
    by an additional 20% if all other aspects of the state of the world persist to
    2070.
  7: 'Millet Yield (ton/ha): Mean 0.714, SD 0.360, Min 0.04, Max 1.951; Average Temp
    (oC): Mean 24.9, SD 3.74, Min 15.8, Max 31.5; Average WDF: Mean 11.51, SD 5.20,

    Observations = 1457; Countries = 31; Years = 47.'
  9: A temperature rise is associated with a fall in millet yield, with the total
    effect of temperature is /C0 0.158, while that of WDF is 0.023.
  10: Direct and indirect effects of TEMP, WDF, and VPD on millet yield are quantified
    in various model specifications, including baseline, linear time trend, no time
    trend, no South Africa, 3 lags, and 4-NN spatial weights. These are reported with
    coefficient estimates and standard errors. Temporal effects of TEMP and WDF are
    also quantified. The effects of TEMP and WDF are also considered for poor countries,
    and the interaction coefficients are estimated.
  12: Projected changes in wet day frequency (WDF), maximum temperature (Th), minimum
    temperature (Tl), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) are used to model millet yield
    impacts.
  14: Millet yield will go down by an additional 26% by the mid-century assuming land
    use remains the same due to unmitigated warming. Current climate models estimate
    an additional 26% loss compared to estimates from observational data, resulting
    in 48% to 55% loss for all models by mid-century.
