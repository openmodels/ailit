Drivers of Risk:
  2: Changes in temperature anomalies due to climate change; response of global warming
    to economic growth
  4: Higher economic growth is associated with changes in temperature anomalies, leading
    to output loss due to global warming.
  5: "Changes in temperature anomalies (\u2206TA)."
  6: Negative influence of current economic growth on climate change through temperature
    anomalies can lead to divergent growth paths.
  7: Climate change due to rapid global warming, specifically temperature anomalies;
    current economic growth
  12: "Growth at t-1, and lagged values of \u2206 TA (t-1 through t-18)"
Highlights:
  2: Rapid global warming, linked to economic growth that is not 'green', can lead
    to fluctuating divergent balanced growth.
  4: The production technology includes a climate change factor, where higher economic
    growth increases temperature anomalies, reducing output due to global warming.
  5: "\u2206TA negatively impacts economic growth, and fitted economic growth consistently\
    \ increases \u2206TA."
  6: 'The model identifies two distinct oscillatory growth dynamics: convergent and
    divergent, informed by the responsiveness of temperature anomalies to current
    economic growth.'
  7: Rapid global warming can lead to divergent balanced growth paths with oscillations
    if growth isn't 'green'; current growth drives climate change; positive influences
    of current economic growth are possible through seigniorage driving productive
    public expenditures; the positive and negative effects are likely to lead to multiple
    equilibria, indeterminancy, and possibly even chaotic behavior.
  10: TA change negatively impacts growth with statistically significant coefficients
    detailed in the first stage of panel data estimation.
  12: "\u2206 TA t-1, \u2206 TA t-12 have statistically significant positive impact\
    \ on \u2206 TA t. Several of the Growth t-1 variables are statistically significant,\
    \ though some are positive and some negative."
Methodology:
  2: Overlapping generations endogenous growth model; Empirical analysis involving
    167 countries over 1851-2018
  4: The analysis utilizes a production function with a climate change factor based
    on the DICE model, linking economic growth to temperature anomalies and output
    loss.
  5: "Fixed-effects panel data estimation involving 167 countries from 1851 to 2018.\
    \ GARCH model is used to derive volatilities of \u2206TA and growth. Regression\
    \ of \u2206TA on fitted growth from the first stage to address endogeneity. Reverse-Mixed\
    \ Data Sampling (MIDAS) model to regress global \u2206TA on lags of itself and\
    \ economic growth."
  6: An overlapping generations endogenous growth model is developed, characterized
    by climate change influences. It uses a fixed-effects panel data estimation of
    167 countries from 1851 to 2018.
  7: Theoretical model
  10: Panel data estimation techniques are used with a first-stage and second-stage
    analysis for Advanced Economies (AEs) and Emerging and Developing Countries (EDCs),
    following the IMF classification.
  12: Reverse-MIDAS (Mixed Data Sampling) regression.
More Notes:
  2: The model posits that changes in temperature anomalies are a positive function
    of current economic growth.
  5: "The analysis controls for volatilities of \u2206TA and economic growth. The\
    \ results hold when categorizing countries by development level."
  12: The notation 'Growth t-1' is repeated six times in the variable column suggesting
    there may have been 6 different growth variables being included in the regression.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Economic growth (oscillatory, convergent, or divergent)
  5: Economic growth, as measured by per-capita real GDP.
  6: The model explores the effects of climate change on economic growth dynamics,
    specifically focusing on growth fluctuations and oscillatory behavior of the economy.
  7: Economic growth, inflation, budget balance (implied by mention of seigniorage
    and public expenditures)
  12: "\u2206 TA t (Change in Total Assets at time t)"
Quantitative material:
  2: No specific quantitative results are presented on this page.
  5: "\u2206TA tends to negatively impact economic growth at least at the 5% level\
    \ of significance."
  10: The table provides panel data estimation results, including coefficients for
    variables such as TA change, TA change volatility, and growth volatility, with
    significance levels noted.
  12: "Coefficient estimates and standard errors for Growth t-1 and lagged \u2206\
    \ TA variables on \u2206 TA t. Statistical significance levels (* p<0.1; ** p<0.05;\
    \ *** p<0.01) are also reported."
