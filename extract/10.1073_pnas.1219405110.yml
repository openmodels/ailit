Drivers of Risk:
  2: No relevant information
  3: Trends in the North Hemisphere Summer Monsoon (NHSM) system, Hadley circulation,
    and Walker circulation; Spatial patterns of lower boundary anomalies associated
    with the NHSM; Pacific SST anomalies (mega-ENSO); Pacific Decadal Oscillation
    (PDO); Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO).
  4: Mega-ENSO, AMO (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation), and hemispheric thermal contrast
    (HTC)
  5: Mega-ENSO, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), hemispheric thermal contrast
    (HTC) driven by differential warming between Northern and Southern Hemispheres,
    volcanic eruptions, anthropogenic aerosol emissions, increasing greenhouse gases.
Highlights:
  2: No relevant information
  3: The NHSM system, Hadley circulation, and Walker circulation show trends between
    1979-2011; A 'mega-ENSO' index is defined to characterize Pacific SST variations
    on multitemporal scales; The mega-ENSO index is correlated with ENSO, PDO and
    IPO.
  4: Mega-ENSO reflects a broader range of variability than ENSO, PDO, or IPO alone.
  5: The intensification of the Northern Hemisphere Summer Monsoon may be largely
    due to internal natural variability, specifically mega-ENSO and AMO. Hemispheric
    thermal contrast also plays a role.
Methodology:
  2: No relevant information
  3: "Uses ERAI and GPCP, version 2.2, data for the period of 1979\u20132011; Statistical\
    \ significance levels are assessed by the trend\u2013noise ratio (TN) and Mann\u2013\
    Kendall rank statistics (MK); Correlation analysis is used to assess the relationships\
    \ between different indices."
  4: Regression analysis using HadISST and ERAI reanalysis data for 1979-2010, correlation
    analysis of NHSM circulation index with mega-ENSO, AMO and HTC indices using merged
    ERA-40 (1958-1978) and ERAI (1979-2011) datasets
  5: Analysis uses global precipitation datasets (GPCP, CMAP), 20th century reanalysis
    data for winds, reconstructed precipitation dataset, and climate model simulations
    (CMIP5 models, POEM model) to examine the relationship between climate variability
    and the Northern Hemisphere Summer Monsoon. Statistical methods include correlation
    analysis, regression analysis, low-pass filtering, and trend analysis. Analysis
    period varies depending on the dataset, but includes periods up to 2011.
More Notes:
  2: No relevant information
  3: No relevant information
  4: NHSM circulation index is well correlated with mega-ENSO, AMO, and hemispheric
    thermal contrast (HTC).
  5: The study focuses on understanding the drivers of the Northern Hemisphere Summer
    Monsoon (NHSM) and its interdecadal variations. The research aims to improve the
    prediction of decadal monsoon changes, which is relevant for planning in various
    sectors. The analysis distinguishes between natural variability and anthropogenic
    effects on climate change.
