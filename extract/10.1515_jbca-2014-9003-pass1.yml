Drivers of Risk:
  1: Focus is on extreme climatic events and ecosystem effects as drivers of risk.
  5: Climate change impacts are the primary driver of risk. Technological limits and
    implementation difficulties are identified as factors constraining adaptation
    and adding uncertainty to impacts calculations.
  6: Climate change itself and its impacts; limits of adaptation (technological, economic,
    informational).
  8: The primary driver of risk is climate change under a business-as-usual, no-GHG-reduction
    scenario.
  9: Climate variables (temperature and precipitation) are key drivers of risk, particularly
    affecting agricultural crop yields.
  11: Climate change, storm surge
  13: Climate change impacts (temperature, precipitation, CO2 levels), Sea level rise,
    Ozone levels.
  15: Sea level rise, changes in hurricane activity, dynamic ice sheet melting in
    Greenland and West Antarctica, drought, flooding, water availability far from
    demand locations
  16: Climate change impacts on hydrologic variables (runoff), hydro-climatic metrics
    (drought indicators), and water management indicators (water stress), drying in
    some regions, and increased precipitation in others.  Low flow effects on ecological
    resources and decreases in hydropower generation.
  17: Climate stressors impacting infrastructure (roads, bridges, urban drainage).
  18: Vulnerable infrastructure from the capital stock; climate stressors; vector-,
    water-, and food-borne diseases; exacerbation of air pollution; thermal stress
    caused by heat waves; negative impacts of malnutrition.
  19: Increased heat stress due to climate change, influenced by GHG emission scenarios
    (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), population changes and adaptation measures.
  20: Climate change leading to increases in daily maximum temperatures.
  21: Rising temperatures will increase electricity demands for cooling and decrease
    demand for heating.
  22: Temperature increases (specifically under RCP 8.5), high daily maximum temperatures
  23: Changes in sea-surface temperature affecting coral coverage; Climate change
    increasing wildfire risk; Climate change affecting cold-water and warm-water fishing
    opportunities.
  24: Gradual changes in temperature and precipitation; extreme events (storm surge,
    wildfire, seasonal flood, high rainfall events overwhelming urban drainage systems);
    hurricane patterns and intensity (storm surge and wind damage).
  25: Flooding, aquatic ecosystems effects, extreme weather events (storms, hurricanes),
    hydrologic processes, water resources, sea level rise, coastal erosion.
  26: Climate change (temperature changes, extreme events)
  27: Climate-driven changes in agricultural production, labor productivity, mortality,
    energy costs, and coastal property loss, Coastal storms.
  28: Intersectoral effects, such as water availability impacting irrigated agricultural
    production and cooling water impacting electric power production, are significant
    drivers of risk.
  31: Climate Change; Hurricane surge; Sea-level rise; Extreme Temperature
Highlights:
  1: Highlights the gaps in comprehensive sectoral coverage, adaptation opportunities,
    and poorly understood cross- and multi-sectoral effects.
  3: CIRA generates new primary literature, while the Risky Business Project interprets
    sub-national literature for national application.
  4: The paper discusses three key gaps and challenges for researchers to provide
    a more comprehensive picture of economic impacts and adaptation costs for the
    US.
  5: The paper highlights the importance of providing policymakers with estimates
    of adaptation costs, the costs of impacts, and the relationship between the two.
    Constrained adaptation, due to factors like technological limits and implementation
    difficulties, adds uncertainty to impacts calculations.
  6: Adaptation can reduce the economic impacts of climate change, but there may be
    limits to adaptation, leading to residual impacts. The optimal level of adaptation
    is a balance between the costs of adaptation and the benefits of avoided impacts.
  11: Significant economic impacts in the United States due to climate change, including
    large annual damages and substantial cumulative losses by 2100.
  13: The importance of carbon fertilization assumptions on agricultural impact estimates;
    potential negative effects of elevated ozone on crop yields; need to integrate
    water resource availability for irrigated production in US analyses; sea level
    rise impacts on US coastal resources.
  15: The US may be poorly adapted to current coastal risks, with individuals underestimating
    the probability and severity of recurring natural risks.
  16: Climate change is projected to have negative economic welfare impacts, particularly
    by 2100, but these can be substantially reduced by GHG mitigation policies.
  17: Roads and bridges may be particularly vulnerable and worth further study.
  18: Adaptation strategies are important and likely to be costly; Mitigation policy
    is effective in reducing infrastructure impacts; infrastructure effects to bridges
    occurring before 2050, and most effects for roads occurring after 2050; health
    costs of adapting to climate change are characterized by a high level of uncertainty
  19: The median effect of climate change may reduce death rates until late century
    under RCP 4.5. However, the higher emissions scenario (RCP 8.5) yields increased
    death rates. Mortality costs can range from negative to very high positive values
    depending on the emissions scenario and time period, with potentially very large
    increases by the end of the century under RCP 8.5.
  20: The effects of climate-driven crime increases are roughly equal to effects on
    commodity crop production.
  21: Rising temperatures will lead to increased electricity demand, resulting in
    higher power system costs. Electricity demand increase of 1.5-6.5% by 2050 translates
    to 1.7-8.3% increase in power system costs.
  22: Temperature increases are projected to significantly increase energy expenditures.
    Labor supply, particularly in high-risk industries, is projected to decline due
    to high temperatures, leading to potentially large changes in labor productivity
    costs.
  23: Coral reef preservation in Hawaii has the greatest recreational benefits from
    mitigation; Climate change increases wildfire risk substantially; Climate change
    initially increases freshwater recreational fishing days, but then declines.
  24: Economic estimates of climate change impacts in the US are increasing in quality
    and comprehensiveness, but much work remains. Impact assessments need to focus
    more on extreme events. The quantified economic benefits (e.g. for freshwater
    fisheries and coral reefs) are solely associated with widely measured recreational
    uses, so are a subset of the total economic and societal benefits.
  25: The analysis considers direct, indirect and business interruption costs related
    to climate change impacts on various sectors.
  26: Effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems affect many sectors.
  27: The macroeconomic effects captured in RHG-MUSE reduce the overall cost of the
    direct climate impacts integrated into the model.
  28: RHG-MUSE can be updated with new data, and estimates suggest late-century economic
    costs of climate change could significantly impact GDP.
  31: New economic estimates of impacts, adaptation, and benefits of mitigation policy
Methodology:
  1: Discusses a framework for economic impacts and adaptation costs with a focus
    on literature review of sectoral studies in the US, not specifically on quantitative
    analysis methodology.
  3: The Risky Business team uses a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to
    assess welfare costs, which is an incomplete component of their work at the time
    of the paper.
  4: The paper reviews and summarizes economic impact and adaptation results by sector
    for the US.
  5: The analysis relies on conceptual figures illustrating the relationship between
    adaptation costs, potential impacts, and residual impacts, drawing upon the IPCC
    AR5 WGII report. The paper points out the absence of accepted methodological tenets
    for impact and adaptation studies in the literature.
  6: Conceptual framework for optimizing the balance between the economic impacts
    of climate change and the cost of adaptation. Mentions the potential for developing
    a tradeoff curve or marginal cost of adaptation step function for sectors and
    locales.
  7: 'Identifies two broad classes of economic applications: studies to inform adaptation
    planners (bottom-up) and studies to inform GHG emissions mitigation regulators
    (top-down).'
  8: The paper reviews sectoral impact and adaptation estimates, focusing on the CIRA
    and Risky Business estimates for the continental US. CIRA emphasizes simulation
    modeling of impacts, while the Risky Business Project emphasizes econometric estimates.
  9: 'Two primary methodologies are used: econometric approaches (historical data
    analysis) and simulation approaches (tracing costs/benefits through mechanisms).
    Econometric approaches establish relationships between climate stressors and outcomes,
    while simulation approaches model climate, biophysical, behavioral, and economic
    components.'
  11: CIRA estimates are estimates of climate risk and impacts, with some values representing
    cumulative effects.
  13: National-scale economic models assessing the impact of climate change on agriculture,
    considering carbon fertilization. National scale impact of sea level rise on US
    coastal resources.
  15: Economic models dependent on sea level rise scenarios.
  16: The CIRA analysis provides a reasonably comprehensive assessment, based on five
    existing, peer-reviewed models that estimate impacts on major parts of the water
    resource sector. The economic supply and demand model is used, alongside a separate
    flooding damages model.
  17: Simulation modeling approach assuming perfect foresight (Larsen et al., 2008);
    Simulation approach (CIRA studies). Climate stressor/response relationships are
    parameterized from the engineering literature
  18: Identify vulnerable infrastructure, develop a stressor-response relationship,
    and identify/apply cost-effective adaptation measures. Econometric approaches
    relating spatial differences in temperature and precipitation regimes with construction
    costs/specifications.
  19: The CIRA study uses city-specific mortality relationships for hot and cold temperatures.
    The Risky Business analysis uses econometric method studies that estimate the
    marginal effect of heat and cold stress. Mortality valuation uses a value of statistical
    life (VSL) approach.
  20: Econometrically estimated impact estimates for the link between climate change
    and crime, focusing on the marginal effect of daily maximum temperatures on violent
    and property crime.
  21: "Three simulation approaches are applied: Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM-USA),\
    \ Regional Electricity Deployment System Model (ReEDS), and Integrated Planning\
    \ Model (IPM\xAE). These models forecast changes in electricity demand as a function\
    \ of changes in heating and cooling degree-days (HDD/CDDs)."
  22: Ekonometrically derived estimates of percentage change in energy expenditures.
    Estimates of Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) are used to estimate impact functions
    for individuals working in high- and low-risk industries. Valuation of labor effects
    is estimated using 2011 IMPLAN input-output tables by geographic area, assuming
    changes in labor productivity translate linearly to changes in value-added.
  23: Uses willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates for recreational use of reefs; MC1 dynamic
    global vegetation model to quantify terrestrial ecosystem carbon storage and areas
    burned by wildfires; assessment of freshwater recreational fishing impacts.
  24: Review of existing economic estimates of climate change impacts in the US. The
    applicability is limited by incomplete assessment of extreme events and sectoral
    coverage.
  25: Econometric studies, simulation studies, and integration of multiple settings
    are used, but the specifics of these methodologies are not detailed on this page.
  26: Econometric studies and simulation used.
  27: A new macroeconomic model of the US economy (RHG-MUSE) that processes the direct
    costs and benefits of climate-driven changes. It utilizes adjustments in the form
    of substitution in response to changes in prices, or changes in capital stock
    or labor supply, to effectively reduce (or in some cases, amplify) the direct
    costs.
  28: Uses flexible models like RHG-MUSE that are updated with new inputs and analyses
    for assessing climate impacts; integrates direct costs and considers intersectoral
    effects.
  31: A general, analytic method for generating robust strategies and narrative scenarios;
    Physically based assessment of hurricane surge threat under climate change; A
    multi-model comparison
More Notes:
  1: The paper is motivated by recent studies like the US EPA's CIRA project and the
    Risky Business Project, mentioning advances in US economic impact assessment.
  2: This page primarily introduces the topic and context of the paper, referencing
    other works and outlining the motivation for studying the economic impacts of
    climate change and adaptation. It doesn't present original quantitative findings.
  3: The paper explicitly excludes results from individual studies, even those at
    a national scale, that are not part of the CIRA and Risky Business initiatives,
    so it is not a complete literature synthesis.
  4: The paper reviews existing literature on economic impacts and adaptation in the
    US across multiple sectors.
  5: The paper distinguishes between anticipatory, autonomous, and planned adaptation.
    The paper emphasizes that residual impacts are a function of choices made to achieve
    cost effectiveness, but also of technological limits. The paper also suggests
    that further constraints on adaptation can arise from implementation difficulties.
  7: Highlights the importance of distinguishing between studies informing adaptation
    planners and those informing GHG emissions mitigation regulators.
  8: The page highlights the difference in perspective between adaptation and mitigation
    planners, and the need for studies to provide estimates of both pure risks of
    inaction and the effects of cost-effective adaptation.
  9: The literature is thinner on impacts to manufacturing, mining, tourism, recreation,
    finance, and insurance, as well as on non-market values such as loss of charismatic
    species, threats to historical or cultural monuments, and displacement of livelihoods.
    These are often secondary effects or are difficult to quantify.
  11: The analysis includes business-as-usual adaptation scenarios, reflecting recent
    GHG emissions. Table 1 lists sectors, including agriculture, coastal resources,
    water resources and infrastructure.
  13: Impacts are relatively modest in the context of the US economy, possibly due
    to carbon fertilization assumptions. Scaling current knowledge to regional scales
    remains a challenge.
  15: Indirect effects of impacts on the diversion of resources from productive to
    defensive capital and the value and importance of ecosystem effects, particularly
    on coastal wetlands, are not adequately addressed in the latest coastal impacts
    literature.
  16: The net welfare effects are very sensitive to the climate model used. There
    is not a single national-scale model available to comprehensively estimate impacts
    of climate change.
  17: Changes in infrastructure capacities and operating rules, particularly for hydropower
    and flood control, may constitute an important source of adaptive capacity that
    has not been explored in economic analyses to date.
  18: Infrastructure analysis simplified perfect foresight models may not incorporate
    realistic learning and baseline road maintenance norms; US public infrastructure
    is currently not built to optimize revenue returns.
  19: "The CIRA study estimates are less than those suggested by other recent studies\
    \ that employ synoptic rather than threshold methods. Valuation of mortality effects\
    \ in the \u201CRisky Business\u201D report (Gordon, 2 014) is based on both the\
    \ value of lost labor (a \u201Chuman capital\u201D approach) and a value of statistical\
    \ life (VSL) measure."
  23: The ecosystem effects focused on are those readily quantified and amenable to
    monetization, which may not be representative of the full range of ecosystem effects.
  25: The page focuses on the economic impacts of climate change in the United States.
    It identifies various sectors and risk factors, but it is relatively high-level.
    The paper appears to review and synthesize the outcomes of other studies, but
    the specificity of this page is low.
  26: Vector-borne disease and water-borne disease risks are highlighted. There is
    a mention of 'tipping points' and 'high-risk' water stress.
  27: The model captures the impact of damaged coastal capital stock in a given year
    on economic growth in subsequent years.
  28: Semi-quantitative suggestions to examine intersectoral effects impacting economic
    variables are proposed for future studies to improve economic impact estimates.
  29: This page is primarily a concluding remark and a reference list. The core analysis
    and results are likely located in other parts of the paper. This page does not
    directly contribute any specific findings or data.
Outcome(s) of Interest:

    but does not provide specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes like GDP effects
    or inflation on this page.
  5: Potential economic impacts of climate change, adaptation cost, and residual impacts

Quantitative material:
  1: No quantitative information on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes is provided on
    this page.
  11: "Risk to 2020 to 2039: \u2013$2.5 to $3.5 billion; 2040 to 2059: \u2013$3.6\
    \ to $7.8 billion; 2050: $66 billion; 2100: $238 billion (using a 5% discount\
    \ rate). Over $4 trillion cumulative impact through 2100. CIRA estimates annual\
    \ offering in these estimates ranges from 3% to 2015. CIRA estimates reflect effects\
    \ of sea level together."
  13: "RCP 8.5 scenario yield changes by 2020\u20132039: \u2013$2.5 billion to $3.5\
    \ billion; by 2040\u20132059: \u2013$3.6 to +$7.8 billion; and by 2080\u20132099:\
    \ \u2013$3.9 to +$24 billion."
  15: Sea level rise could cause $42 billion in damage annually, potentially increasing
    to $108 billion with changes in hurricane activity.
  16: Under primary model results, a welfare increase of $0.5 billion per year in
    2050, but by 2100, the model estimates decreases in welfare of $6.5 billion per
    year. Results for other climate models show decreases in welfare of from $15.0
    billion to over $100 billion per year by 2100. GHG mitigation policy yields $3.3
    billion per year in 2050 and $9.4 billion per year by 2100 for the preferred model,
    and $14.5 billion to $84 billion per year in 2100 for alternative models. Climate
    change increases flooding losses for 10 of the 18 major basins, and mitigation
    yields an overall increase in welfare on the order of $2.5 billion dollars per
    year by 2100.
  18: Cumulative impacts total about $260 billion (discounted at 3%), with $160 billion
    from bridges, and $80 billion from roads, and $20 billion from urban drainage;
    Mitigation policy is effective in reducing these impacts (by $85 billion discounted).
  19: 'Mortality estimates for 33 US cities: 2,000-2,700 net additional mortalities
    in 2050; 7,500-12,500 by 2100 (or 3,200-5,900 with a different temperature threshold).
    With population projections: 2,700 in 2050 and 12,500 in 2100. Death rate changes
    per 100,000 under RCP 4.5: -3.3 to 2.3 (2020-2039); -3.2 to 4.0 (mid-century);
    -2.5 to 5.9 (end-century). Under RCP 8.5: death rate increase at the median of
