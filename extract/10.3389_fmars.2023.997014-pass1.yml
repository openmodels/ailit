Drivers of Risk:
  3: Climate change impacts such as sea surface temperature anomalies influence technical
    efficiency of artisanal fishing fleets.
  7: Fuel consumption, sea surface temperature (SST), and fisheries catches (crustacean,
    large_pelagic, marine, mixed_pelagic, mollusc, diadromous) are used as risk drivers.
    Country-specific effects (Algeria, Angola, Antigua Barb, ..., Eritrea) are also
    included as drivers.
  10: Sea surface temperature warming, increased fuel costs, competitive pricing of
    imports, regional tuna fisheries expansion, climate variability, and weather extremes.
  11: Government subsidies, especially for fuel, leading to excess capacities in Asian
    fishing fleets.
  12: Fuel price changes and fishing productivity affect efficiency; excess capacity
    due to low fuel prices can lead to low efficiency.
  13: Economic cycles affecting fishing costs and demand, ongoing global warming,
    price increases for diadromous fish, and SST anomalies.
Highlights:
  3: The study examines how short-term climatic changes affect the technical efficiency
    of artisanal fishing fleets globally, particularly due to sea surface temperature
    anomalies.
  7: Fuel consumption, crustacean catches, and diadromous catches have highly significant
    (***) positive impacts. Sea Surface Temperature and Large Pelagic catches are
    significant with p <0.05 (*), and marine catches have a significant negative impact
    (**). Several countries are shown to have a significant effect, with generally
    negative impacts (***, **) for some and positive impacts for others, relative
    to the model intercept (global average).
  9: Some countries like Palau, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu have high statistical
    significance in their results, with either positive or negative estimates.
  10: North American and European regions have benefited from SST and efficiency increases
    in fisheries, particularly since the 1990s.
  11: The analysis shows a positive coefficient for fuel price and a negative coefficient
    for marine fish price on technical efficiency, which is counterintuitive.
  12: Technological advancements and skill development can improve fishing productivity
    despite falling stock biomasses.
  13: Economic (prices, costs) and environmental (SST anomalies) significantly explain
    past changes in global artisanal fleets technical efficiency. These effects vary
    regionally.
Methodology:
  3: Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to estimate technical efficiency of artisanal
    fishing fleets, assessing how output changes with inputs such as kW power, fishing
    days, and number of vessels.
  7: The analysis uses Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and bootstrapped OLS (bias-corrected
    (bc)) regressions.
  10: Analysis involves examining regions separately and considers factors like SST
    and fuel costs on technical efficiency across different fishing categories.
  13: The paper presents an initial examination of the global artisanal fleet to improve
    our understanding of the factors that have influenced fishing efficiency concerning
    resource users, market dynamics, and climate change. The analysis goes one step
    further to understand how the technical efficiency of the fisheries can be compromised
    or not by these global changes.
More Notes:
  7: The dependent variable is not explicitly stated. The table shows the results
    of Model 1. Significance levels are indicated by asterisks (*, **, ***) without
    explicitly defining the p-values.
  8: The term column lists country names. The asterisks denote statistical significance,
    but the corresponding p-values or significance levels are not defined on this
    page. The table is continued from a previous page.
  10: Artisanal vessels face challenges from market changes forcing alterations in
    production strategies.
  12: The page mainly focuses on fishing industry dynamics, including the effects
    of fuel prices and technology advancements on fishing efficiency.
  13: The paper focuses on the technical efficiency of fisheries in the context of
    economic and environmental changes. The study highlights the importance of understanding
    how artisanal fishing systems respond to global environmental and societal change,
    including economic cycles and global warming.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  7: The model appears to predict an unspecified outcome based on several factors.
  8: Unspecified; the table presents estimates that are related to the impact of something
    on countries, but the exact macroeconomic or fiscal outcome being measured is
    not defined on this page.
  10: Potential decrease in artisanal fisher efficiency and economic consequences
    for coastal communities.
  12: The page discusses technical efficiency and fishing productivity, but there's
    no specific mention of broader macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  13: Food security and economic security (maintaining jobs, livelihoods, and wellbeing)
    can be affected by changes in seafood production.
Quantitative material:
  7: The table provides coefficient estimates, bias, standard errors, bias-corrected
    estimates, lower confidence limits (lcl), and upper confidence limits (ucl) for
    each risk driver and country.
  8: Estimates, bias, standard error, bias-corrected estimates (bc), lower confidence
    level (lcl), and upper confidence level (ucl) are provided for each country listed.
    The estimates range from approximately -0.30 to 0.27. Significance levels are
    indicated with asterisks (*, **, ***).
  9: The table provides numerical estimates with statistical significance for various
    countries, including Oman, Pakistan, Palau, and more.
  13: China landed ~9 million tonnes of seafood within its EEZ in 2010; the global
    artisanal fleet was estimated to account for over 34 million tonnes of global
    marine catches in 2012 (World Bank, 2012), although more recent estimates put
    this figure at 37 million tonnes.
