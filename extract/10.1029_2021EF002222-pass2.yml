Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (specifically, climate models from the downscaled Multivariate
    Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA)), socioeconomic changes (population growth).
  2: Socioeconomic scenarios (SSPs 1, 2, 3, and 5) and climate models (RCPs 4.5 and
    8.5) impacting water outcomes. Specifically population growth, income, temperature,
    precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration.
  3: Decreased precipitation, Warmer temperatures, increased potential evapotranspiration
    (PET)
  4: Projected changes in temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and precipitation
    are drivers impacting water use.
  5: Past trends in water withdrawal rates, and the application of annual growth rates
    and decay in those growth rates to extrapolate future withdrawals.
  8: Long-term impacts include decisions like purchasing air conditioners in response
    to higher temperatures.
  10: Climate change (decreases in precipitation)
  11: Decreased precipitation in the northern and southern Great Plains, per-capita
    income driving industrial growth, and GDP growth influencing electricity demand.
  12: Warmer temperatures and more drastic weather changes (e.g., droughts and precipitation
    declines) driven by climate change are identified as drivers of risk impacting
    water use in different sectors. Population growth is also a driver.
  13: Climate change (implied through RCP scenarios), population growth, livestock
    raising, agriculture practices, water management strategies
  14: Climate models (dry, wet, middle), socioeconomic factors (population growth,
    technology), emissions scenarios (RCP 8.5)
  15: Future drivers like climate and population are uncertain and rapidly changing
    water use patterns.
  16: Changes in the spatial patterns of precipitation, water yield, and potential
    evapotranspiration
  19: Future climate change, specifically potential evapotranspiration under RCP 4.5
    and RCP 8.5 scenarios.

Highlights:
  1: Dry regions see the largest increases in freshwater use, with 8% decreases under
    best-case scenarios but 235% increases under worst-case scenarios. Because agriculture
    is the dominant use of water in most regions, climate change impacts overwhelm
    all other factors under hot and dry futures. For the wetter climate models, water
    use decreases even under the highest emissions levels and highest population growth
    rates.
  2: Highlights where the status quo is unsustainable and, therefore, where management
    actions are most needed regarding water use.
  3: Warmer temperatures in the South are projected to increase potential evapotranspiration
    (PET) more than for any other region of the U.S. Higher rates of PET amplify the
    effects of decreased precipitation in the South, leading to further declines in
    water yield.
  4: Different climate models predict variations in Potential Evapotranspiration (PET)
    across western US river basins, particularly under wet and warm conditions.
  8: Projected shifts in electricity generation mix, with increases in natural gas
    and renewables, are likely to decrease water withdrawals and consumption.
  10: Climate change compounds the effects of population, leading to more water use
    as households offset decreases in precipitation with increases in water withdrawals
    for outdoor use; Industrial water withdrawals have been declining due to improvements
    in water efficiency and structural changes throughout the U.S. economy.
  11: Significant projected increases in water use under high growth scenarios for
    industrial and thermoelectric sectors, with regional variations in both usage
    and technological adoption.
  12: Climate change could significantly increase water use for thermoelectric power
    generation and irrigation, with regional variations in the impact. The South Atlantic
    Gulf region is projected to consume nearly 800 million gallons per day for thermoelectric
    generation in 2070 under the lowest projections. The western U.S. may see a net
    increase in water used for agriculture despite declining precipitation.
  13: The West and parts of the Southeast see relatively large increases in water
    use for many of the scenarios, particularly in the intermountain region.
  14: Aggregate impacts of climate and socioeconomic changes depend on which future
    the U.S. sees; national averages mask regional challenges, especially in driest
    parts of the country with less water and higher demand; water users have made
    considerable improvements in efficiency in recent decades.
  15: Projections were overestimated for Great Lakes and Ohio regions and underestimated
    for Mid-Atlantic and Great Basin regions.
  16: No relevant information
  19: Potential evapotranspiration is projected to change spatially across the contiguous
    United States under different climate scenarios (Wet, Warm, Mid, Hot, Dry) and
    emission pathways (RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5).
Methodology:
  1: Projections are based on socioeconomic and climate scenarios from the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). Scenarios are paired with
    five climate models from the downscaled Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs
    (MACA). The study examines recent trends in freshwater use and makes projections
    for future freshwater use over the next 50 years.
  2: Extrapolates past trends of withdrawal rates (e.g., water use per capita, irrigation
    depth) and applies those rates to projections of water-using units (population,
    acres irrigated). Uses five downscaled MACA climate models and county-level projections
    for population and income for SSPs from Wear and Prestemon (2019).  The projections
    focus on the period covered by SSPs and RCPs and rely on the literature and other
    data sources.
  3: VIC uses the Penman-Monteith equation to calculate potential evapotranspiration.
  4: Withdrawals are calculated as the product of water demand units and withdrawal
    rates, incorporating the effects of climate change.
  5: Extrapolates past trends in water withdrawal using annual growth and decay rates,
    applied at the Water Resource Region (WRR) level, projecting withdrawals with
    a 5-year time step. The method uses withdrawal records from 1985 to 2015 to compute
    growth and decay rates.
  8: The projection involves aggregating electricity demand to energy regions and
    then apportioning it based on county population.
  11: Assessment considers socioeconomic and climatic scenarios from 2015 to 2070,
    examining changes in industrial and thermoelectric water use.
  13: Projections are made using RCP and SSP scenarios; livestock water demand projections
    do not include climate effects.
  14: Climate models are used to project future water yield and demand, considering
    both climate and socioeconomic scenarios. Projections assume technology and the
    share of thermoelectric generation will remain near current levels.
  15: Comparison of projections made using different methods with recent USGS data;
    primarily involves analysis of projection accuracy across WRRs.
  16: "Uses the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model at the 4 \xD7\
    \ 4 km spatial resolution, analyzing data from five selected MACA models and two\
    \ RCPs for mid-century (2041\u20132070) and end-of-century (2070\u20132099)"
  19: The analysis projects potential evapotranspiration changes based on RCP 4.5
    and RCP 8.5 scenarios, showing spatial changes in 30-year averages for mid-century
    and end-century timeframes.
More Notes:
  1: National trends in water use mask local challenges throughout the U.S. Decreases
    in surface water use were sometimes offset by increases in groundwater use. Population
    growth is expected to increase domestic water uses in fast-growing regions. Results
    vary more by climate model more than by socioeconomic scenario.
  2: The study uses the CMIP5 convention where SSPs and RCPs are separate to examine
    the relative impacts of climate and socioeconomic forces.  It updates Brown et
    al. (2013) and relates to Duan et al. (2019).
  5: Growth and decay rates are specified according to Water Resource Regions (WRR),
    dividing the US into eastern and western divisions. Future water withdrawal is
    calculated at the county level.
  10: The page includes figures showing water withdrawals by sector and state, as
    well as maps illustrating changes in domestic water consumption across scenarios,
    and the standard deviation in percent change in domestic water consumption across
    scenarios.
  13: The portion of withdrawals consumptively used vary by sector and region; the
    intermountain region has the largest amount of use among regions
  14: The interaction between socioeconomic and climate impacts is also seen in the
    thermoelectric sector, which responds to the increased electricity demands of
    a larger population and the increased demand per person due to warmer temperatures.
  15: Projections do not include scarcity considerations and were affected by economic
    shifts and drought responses.
  16: Figure A1 depicts US population and GDP projections based on five socioeconomic
    pathways (SSPs) indexed to 2015.
  19: Data will be archived in the US Forest Service Research Data Archive.
Quantitative material:
  1: Total consumptive water use will decrease by as much as 8% under the best-case
    scenario but increase by as much as 235% under the worst-case scenario. 64% of
    counties in the United States saw net decreases in surface water withdrawals between
    2005 and 2015.
  2: Projections of future freshwater use based on extrapolating past trends of withdrawal
    rates and applying those rates to projections of water-using units.
  3: Climate projections show high variability between models; In the South, Southeast,
    and Great Plains, the dry climate model shows a decrease in water yield. The wet
    and hot models show increases in water yield for these same regions; increases
    in precipitation and yield for much of the western United States and decreases
    in water yield in the South.
  4: Withdrawal rates are specific to sectors and calculated in units like gallons
    per person or gallons per acre.
  5: Presents equations (3) and (4) for calculating water withdrawal rates and projecting
    future withdrawals, respectively.
  10: 78% of counties are projected to see decreases in domestic water use; Industrial
    water withdrawals have been declining at an annualized rate of 1.8% since at least
    1985.
  11: Projected annual changes in thermoelectric consumptive water use, ranging from
    approximately 2.5 billion gallons per day in 2015 to between 5 and 17 billion
    gallons per day by 2070, dependent on scenarios.
  13: Under RCP 4.5, climate impacts are small and total consumptive use falls far
    from many regions.
  14: Water use decreases by 8% under best-case scenario; water use increases by 235%
    under worst-case scenario; population in the West and Southwest double under high
    growth SSP5 scenario; domestic water use in the South-Central US projected to
    double under the dry model with SSP5 and RCP 8.5.
  15: A1B scenario projected about 20% more water withdrawn in 2015 than reported
    by USGS.
  16: No relevant information
  19: Spatial changes in 30-year average of annual potential evapotranspiration are
    mapped under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5.
