Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, population growth, socioeconomic changes
  4: Future climate change impacts like temperature, potential evapotranspiration,
    and precipitation changes are projected to affect water use sectors in the U.S.
  6: Changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration affect water withdrawals
    per capita in the domestic sector.
  7: "Changes in effective precipitation (\u0394P\u2019) and potential evapotranspiration\
    \ (\u0394ETp) during the growing season, and thermoelectric plant locations."
  9: Climate change induced temperature increase (affects electricity consumption);
    population growth (affects domestic water use).
  10: Climate change compounds the effects of population, leading to more water use
    as households offset decreases in precipitation with increases in water withdrawals
    for outdoor use.
  11: Changes in precipitation and socioeconomic scenarios, such as GDP growth affecting
    electricity demand and water use in different regions.
  12: Climate change (warmer temperatures, more drastic weather changes, declines
    in precipitation), population growth, increased irrigation in the East, competition
    for water between agriculture and municipalities in the West, increased frequency
    of drought.
  14: Climate models and socioeconomic factors impacting water yield and use in different
    U.S. regions.
  15: Droughts are mentioned as influencing water use, sometimes leading to increased
    use to protect crops and other times spurring larger reductions than projected.
    Also, Large declines in manufacturing led to reductions in water use beyond what
    was expected in manufacturing centers.
  16: Socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), Climate Change (implied by references to RCPs
    and MACA models)
Highlights:
  1: Agriculture is the dominant use of water in most regions, climate change impacts
    overwhelm all other factors under hot and dry futures.
  4: The paper's focus is on projecting future water withdrawals altered by climate
    change, rather than directly on macroeconomic outcomes.
  6: The methodology ties water use in the livestock sector to domestic demand for
    meat, acknowledging that exports are driven more by trade policies than global
    food demand.
  7: A new approach to projecting water use at thermoelectric plants is presented
    that utilizes EIA-reported data on fuel consumption and net electricity generation
    to model the heat and water budgets of 1,274 individual thermoelectric utility
    plants.
  9: Long-term effect of temperature increase on electricity consumption is smallest
    in southern, hotter areas and rises progressively moving north (except WRR 17).
    Under high population growth scenarios, domestic water use is projected to increase
    significantly, especially in the South and West.
  10: While population drives most of the domestic water use, the high levels of uncertainty
    tend to be where climate models differ.
  11: Significant increases in thermoelectric water consumption are projected, with
    regional shifts in distribution of consumption due to technological changes and
    regional economic growth.
  12: Warmer temperatures may increase water use for power generation. Water use for
    agriculture may increase despite efficiency improvements and acreage declines
    in the West. Eastern water usage for agriculture has been expanding.
  14: Water demand varies greatly between scenarios, with potential for significant
    increases in arid regions and challenges due to climate and population growth
    intersecting.
  15: Projections generally performed well. The largest overestimates were for WRRs
    4 and 5 (the Great Lakes and Ohio regions); the largest underestimates were for
    WRRs 2 and 16 (Mid-Atlantic and Great Basin regions). Differences between projections
    and observed data represent economic shifts larger than those observed in historical
    data trends.
  16: GDP is projected to increase under all Socioeconomic Pathways to 2070 relative
    to a 2015 baseline. SSPx shows U.S. aggregate projections.
Methodology:
  1: Projections are based on socioeconomic and climate scenarios from the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report. Scenarios are paired with five
    climate models from the downscaled Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA).  The
    time horizon is the next 50 years.
  4: The analysis projects water use by enhancing spatial resolution and incorporating
    climate change impacts, using data from downscaled global climate models and past
    USGS water data.
  6: Future livestock and aquaculture withdrawals are based on human population at
    the WRR (Water Resources Region) spatial scale, apportioning the total to counties
    based on past withdrawals (gallons per person). Withdrawals in each sector are
    converted to consumptive use using state-level proportions. Climate effects on
    domestic water withdrawals are computed as a combination of changes in precipitation
    and potential evapotranspiration.
  7: Regression analysis at the WRR scale (for domestic water withdrawals); Calculation
    of change in irrigation withdrawals per acre based on changes in precipitation
    and evapotranspiration; Modeling heat and water budgets of individual thermoelectric
    utility plants based on fuel consumption, electricity generation, and water availability.
  9: Uses coefficients based on WRR to estimate changes in thermoelectric energy production
    due to temperature increase. Short-term residential electricity consumption changes
    estimated by Sailor and Pavlova (2003) for 12 cities were extrapolated to the
    18 WRRs to estimate total electricity consumption changes. Change in water consumption
    is estimated using population projections from Wear & Prestemon (2019) under different
    SSP scenarios.
  10: Analysis of water withdrawals by sector and state; projection of domestic water
    use changes based on climate models and population changes.
  11: Projections are based on different socioeconomic and climatic scenarios, focusing
    on changes in water consumption for industrial and thermoelectric use across regions.
  12: Projections of consumptive water use for thermoelectric power generation, irrigation
    rates, and acres irrigated are presented under different scenarios, projecting
    water use to 2070. Model differences are noted (e.g., wet and warm climate models
    showing California getting wetter by mid-century under RCP 8.5).
  15: The paper compares water withdrawal projections from Brown et al. (2013) to
    actual 2015 withdrawal data from USGS circulars to evaluate model performance.
    Population and income projections are taken from Wear and Prestemon (2019) using
    an approach based on principles in the economic growth theory.
  16: GDP projections are downscaled to the county level (DS.x). Graphs provide projections
    of GDP under different SSPs.
More Notes:
  1: This study focuses on freshwater use projections, which indirectly relates to
    macroeconomic and fiscal risks through impacts on agriculture and other water-dependent
    sectors.
  4: Model agencies and methodologies pertaining to climate model selection and projections
    are detailed, but not linked to national macro-fiscal outcomes.
  6: The model projects 'desired water use', assuming increases in consumptive use
    are met without regard to water supply availability. This assumption is suitable
    for projections but would need reconsideration for vulnerability analysis.
  7: The paper uses a new approach based on EIA data to estimate thermoelectric water
    consumption, which avoids relying on potentially inaccurate USGS estimates. It
    explicitly models the heat and water budgets of thermoelectric plants, differentiating
    between different electricity generation and cooling system types.
  9: Residential and commercial sectors consumed 37% and 36% of U.S. electricity production
    in 2015, respectively.
  10: The paper analyzes water withdrawal trends and projects future changes, which
    could potentially inform assessments of economic risks related to water scarcity
    but does not directly quantify macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes. Focus is
    on water use changes and contributing drivers (climate, population, industrial
    efficiency).
  12: The paper focuses on water use changes in the US, specifically for thermoelectric
    power generation, irrigation, livestock, and aquaculture. The analysis differentiates
    between the Eastern and Western US due to differing water supply dynamics.
  15: The accuracy of water use projections is affected by uncertainties in future
    drivers of water use (e.g., climate, population), changes in water usage patterns,
    and the exclusion of scarcity considerations in the projections.
  16: The projections use constant 2005 dollars. Projections of U.S. Population are
    also provided.

    (1985-2010) to nearly 2 feet in 2015. Western irrigation rates were 2.3 feet in
    2015, declining at an annualized rate of 0.85% between 1985 and 2015. Acres irrigated
    in the West are projected to decline from about 46,800 acres in 2015 to just under
    46,000 by 2070. Total water used for irrigation in the United States is projected
    to increase from 116 billion gallons in 2015 to 134 billion gallons in 2070.
