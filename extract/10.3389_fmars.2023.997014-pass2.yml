Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, sea surface temperature anomalies, market prices by taxonomic
    group, and fuel costs.
  2: Climate change and economic change are the main drivers affecting the technical
    efficiency of the global artisanal fishing fleet. Other drivers mentioned are
    unsustainable yields, increases in the price of fish products, exogenous drivers
    (e.g., climatic, costs and prices) that influence fishing.
  3: Sea surface temperature anomalies, short-term periodic changes in climatic conditions,
    extreme temperature anomalies.
  4: Annual sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies from a country's Exclusive Economic
    Zone (EEZ) is used as a predictor variable.
  5: Catch price, fuel costs, and Sea Surface Temperature (SST).
  6: Fuel price increases, SST anomalies (sea surface temperature), crustacean prices.
  10: Drivers of risk include sea surface temperature warming, climate variability
    and weather extremes, increasing fuel prices, expansion of regional tuna fisheries,
    changes in market forces (e.g., competitive pricing of imported foods), and internally
    driven changes in market forces affecting artisanal vessels.
  11: Fuel price, SST, crustaceans, large pelagic, mixed pelagic, marine fishes, molluscs,
    and diadromous fishes
  13: Economic cycles affecting fishing costs and demand, ongoing global warming,
    and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies are identified as drivers of risk
    to artisanal fishing efficiency.
Highlights:
  1: Temperature anomalies affected countries differently; some enhanced production,
    others had to adapt to negative impacts of seawater warming; efficiency decreases
    are related to rises in global marine fish price.
  2: Artisanal fisheries are important for employment and nutrition, especially in
    developing countries, but are often unregulated and less studied than industrial
    fisheries. Countries with years of low technical efficiency in fishing are also
    those with a high vulnerability to climate-induced change and low adaptive capacity
    (low GDP).
  3: The paper explores how sea surface temperature anomalies affect the technical
    efficiencies of artisanal fleets globally and how changing market conditions affect
    technical efficiency.
  5: Elasticities of technical efficiency with respect to catch price, fuel costs
    and SST varied widely depending on the country. Elasticities were inelastic.
  6: Fuel price increases generally had a positive effect on technical efficiency,
    with regional variations; SST anomalies had varying effects by region, with some
    regions showing positive effects and others negative; Crustacean prices had the
    largest positive effects on technical efficiency.
  9: The table highlights statistically significant estimates (*** p < 0.001, ** p
    < 0.01, * p < 0.05, . p < 0.1) for each country.
  10: Key findings include the negative impact of climate change and fuel price increases
    on fisheries' technical efficiency and the potential for distributional changes
    of species affecting the allocation of catches between countries. The North American/Europe
    region has benefited from SST increases and technical efficiency improvements.
    Artisanal vessels may be forced to alter production strategies due to market forces.
  11: The study shows a positive coefficient for fuel price and a negative coefficient
    for marine fish price, which is non-intuitive in terms of the effects on technical
    efficiency.
  13: Economic (prices, costs) and environmental (SST anomalies) factors significantly
    explain past changes in global artisanal fleets' technical efficiency, but these
    effects vary regionally.
Methodology:
  1: Examined historical changes in technical efficiency within the global artisanal
    fishing fleets in relation to sea surface temperature anomalies, market prices
    by taxonomic group, and fuel costs.
  2: The study aims to fill the gap in the literature by focusing on the global artisanal
    fishing fleet and how technical efficiency is affected under climate and economic
    change, using global catch reconstruction time series and satellite remote sensing
    to address changes in stock levels.
  3: Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to estimate technical efficiency, which
    is the ratio of catch to potential catch. A second stage statistical approach
    (Hoff, 2007) is used to predict technical efficiency scores subject to market
    dynamics (costs and prices) and sea surface temperature anomalies. Bias-corrected
    deterministic technical efficiency scores are provided to improve statistical
    validity.
  4: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is used to fit a statistical model to
    explain differences in bias-corrected technical efficiency scores. The study period
    used to determine the mean SST differences were from 1950-2014, using a baseline
    period from 1981-2010.
  5: "A two-stage bootstrap method (Simar and Wilson, 2007) was used to correct for\
    \ the right-skewed distribution of efficiency scores and bias-correct estimates.\
    \ The first stage bootstrapped efficiency scores, and the second stage modeled\
    \ these scores with predictor variables using another bootstrap. Model selection\
    \ was performed systematically fitting all possible combinations of available\
    \ uncorrelated variables using the R package \u2018glmulti\u2019."
  6: Regression models (AIC, DAIC, Wt(AIC) used for model selection) to analyze the
    drivers of technical efficiency in artisanal fisheries.
  10: The study uses a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology. The authors state
    that estimating the differences between weather events affecting capacity utilization
    and technical efficiency could potentially be estimated via two different DEA
    models.
  11: Analysis of the country-level marginal effect elasticities of various factors
    on technical efficiency in fishing. The results are applicable to understanding
    the impact of these factors on fishing efficiency.
  13: The paper presents an examination of the global artisanal fleet to understand
    factors influencing fishing efficiency concerning resource users, market dynamics,
    and climate change. The analysis goes a step further than studies focusing on
    catches and profits, to understand how the technical efficiency of fisheries can
    be compromised by global changes.
More Notes:
  1: The paper examines the impact of climate change and economic factors on the technical
    efficiency of global artisanal fishing fleets.
  2: Excess capacity in a fishing fleet may be important for countries to have for
    adaptive reasons, such as preparedness to address maintenance issues or to respond
    to cyclic weather systems.
  3: The DEA process is criticized for being nonparametric, as it does not account
    for random error, resulting in the underestimation of the efficiency scores due
    to serial correlation.
  4: Fisheries technical efficiency is modeled as a function of SST anomalies, fuel
    prices, and the prices of various fish and seafood categories.
  5: Maximum values are used instead of means to compare elasticities across countries,
    and country effects are considered. A positive coefficient for fuel price was
    found, suggesting that higher prices drive higher efficiencies. A positive coefficient
    for SST shows positive changes in technical efficiency to warmer-than-average
    years.
  6: The analysis covers the last 6 decades and considers country-level effects.
  10: The paper acknowledges that incorporating weather extreme events into future
    studies could provide further insights into the risks affecting at-sea operations
    and fisheries' technical efficiency. Improved education, communication, and navigation
    technologies are expected to increase technical efficiency over time.
  11: Government subsidies, particularly for fuel, are identified as a potential driver
    of excess capacity in fishing fleets.
  13: The paper highlights the importance of understanding the effects of economic
    and environmental factors on fisheries for many of the world's poorest countries
    that rely on fisheries for nutrition and food security. The analysis emphasizes
    the need to understand how different artisanal fishing systems respond to dynamic
    global environmental and societal change.

Quantitative material:
  1: Historical changes (1950-2014) in technical efficiency within the global artisanal
    fishing fleets.
  2: Mentions that global government subsidies for fisheries represent US$35.4 billion
    annually (but cites Sumaila et al., 2019, for this figure).
  3: Technical efficiency scores derived from Data Envelopment Analysis by year, country,
    and sector (artisanal for 105 countries over the period 1950-2014).
  5: All elasticities were found to be inelastic, i.e., less than a 1% change in technical
    efficiency from a 1% change in exogenous predictor variables. Largest global negative
    effect ~ -0.1% on technical efficiency (e.g., a 1% change in marine prices results
    in a 0.1% decrease in fishing efficiency) was found because of an increase in
    marine fish prices in Oceania and South America.
  6: Fuel price increases had a positive effect on the technical efficiency of artisanal
    fleets in most regions (~0.1% in Oceania; ~0.12% in Europe).
  9: The table provides quantitative estimates for the economic "term," bias, standard
    error (std.error), bias-corrected estimate (bc), lower confidence limit (lcl),
    and upper confidence limit (ucl) for each country.
  11: Country-level marginal effect elasticities (percentage change in technical efficiency
    for a 1% change in the predictor variables)
  13: The global artisanal fleet was estimated to account for over 34 million tonnes
    of global marine catches in 2012. A 1% shock on seafood production in China (which
    landed ~9 million tonnes in its EEZ in 2010) could have dramatic effects.
