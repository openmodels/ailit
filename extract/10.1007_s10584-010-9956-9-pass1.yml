Drivers of Risk:
  3: Hydroclimatic variability (specifically, negative precipitation anomalies/drought).
  4: Anthropogenic climate changes due to greenhouse gas emissions, changes in temperature
    and precipitation, and increased precipitation variability.
  5: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns due to climate change.
  7: Climate variability and climate change differentials impacting economic growth
    in Sub-Saharan Africa.
  8: Climate variability, particularly rainfall variability.
  11: The primary driver of risk discussed is hydroclimatic variability, particularly
    in the context of climate change.
  12: Climate variability (specifically of soil moisture) and climate means (average
    conditions) of soil moisture and temperature.
  13: Hydroclimatic variability.
  14: Rainfall extremes, annual average temperature and precipitation.
  16: Anomalous rainfall, specifically drought and flooding. Drought is measured using
    negative anomalies of the WASP (Water Availability and Security Platform) index,
    which correlates with the Palmer Drought Severity Index.
  17: Climate variability
  19: Climate measures for country i at time t; rainfall; mean annual temperature
  21: Precipitation and temperature changes
  22: Precipitation variability impacts economic growth, particularly through climate
    extremes like droughts.
  23: Moderate and severe droughts, temperature, and precipitation influence economic
    outcomes.
  25: Drought (as measured by drought indices and WASP variables)
  26: Drought and precipitation significantly affect agricultural value added and
    poverty count, with drought notably impacting those living on less than $1/day.
  27: Persistent dry conditions (drought), hydroclimatic variability, temperature.
  28: Hydroclimatic variability, particularly drought and lack of data on flood risk,
    impacts economic growth in SSA.
  29: Drought, floods, climate variability, hydroclimatic extremes, rainfall shocks.
  30: Hydroclimatic risk (floods, droughts, hydrologic variability).
  35: Foreign (potentially related to foreign direct investment or trade), Temp (temperature),
    Year6SMS (unclear, possibly related to climate or economic shocks)
  36: No relevant information
Highlights:
  3: Drought is a more significant risk to economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa than
    temperature increases.
  4: Climate change poses a growing concern for policy makers due to its potential
    negative effects on economic growth. Projections of precipitation changes and
    higher-order statistics of rainfall are more uncertain than temperature projections.
  5: The relative importance of temperature vs. precipitation changes as climate risks
    depends on a country's economic sensitivity to climate, which is influenced by
    factors like agriculture's importance, infrastructure, insurance systems, and
    prevailing climate conditions. Industrialized economies may be more sensitive
    to temperature changes, while countries at lower latitudes with less diversified
    economies may be more sensitive to precipitation changes.
  8: Climate, especially rainfall variability, is identified as a dominant negative
    effect on economic growth in SSA; hydroclimatic variability remains a major source
    of risk.
  11: "The paper highlights that few studies have considered the effects of hydroclimatic\
    \ variability on national-level economic development, despite evidence from household\
    \ and village studies. Climate variability is identified as one source of the\
    \ \u201Cgeography effect\u201D in cross-country studies."
  12: The most significant climate effects on farm income depend on the nation considered.
    In Brazil, climate variability was more significant than climate means, and precipitation
    was more important than temperature.
  13: This study attempts to address the gap in analysis of the economic effects of
    climate variability at the country scale, particularly in SSA.
  16: The study suggests that the impact of rainfall anomalies on economic growth
    is likely nonlinear, making a threshold approach (WASP) more appropriate than
    using a single precipitation series. There are likely little or no effects due
    to small aberrations in rainfall, while large anomalies likely have very large
    effects. The responses to positive and negative anomalies are unlikely to be symmetric.
  17: Cross-country regressions are used primarily to establish that a substantial
    relationship exists in our data between climate variability and a variety of our
    livelihood indicators.
  19: Fixed effects are used to control for unobserved time-invariant country characteristics,
    addressing potential inconsistencies in cross-sectional estimates and the possibility
    that hydroclimatic variability might depend on time-invariant characteristics.
  21: Temperature tends to have a negative and statistically significant relationship
    with GDP growth when precipitation is not included.
  22: Drought risk negatively affects GDP per capita growth, with results robust across
    model specifications.
  23: Drought negatively affects both agricultural and industrial GDP; positive rainfall
    anomalies benefit agriculture; industrial GDP positively associated with precipitation.
  25: Drought is the most influential climate effect on economic growth in SSA as
    measured in this study. Moderate drought is negatively associated at the 99% confidence
    level with per capita GDP growth.
  26: Moderate and severe droughts negatively affect agricultural value added, and
    above average rains have positive benefits.
  27: Drought has a consistent negative effect on economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa.
    Temperature may not be indicative of the most important climate effects on economic
    growth, drought may be of greater concern.
  28: Hydroclimatic variability is a significant impediment to agricultural productivity
    and national economies in SSA.
  29: Managing current climate risks is the foundation of adaptation and engenders
    economic growth. Drought is identified as the primary concern, leading to a poverty
    trap in rural SSA.
  30: Investment in infrastructure and technologies that provide infrastructure services
    are likely needed to reduce the effects of hydroclimatic risk on economic growth
    in SSA. Developed countries have invested heavily in infrastructure to reduce
    their exposure to hydroclimatic risks.
  36: Without the full context of the paper, it is hard to highlight specific outcomes.
    However, the regression results show the statistical significance and magnitude
    of coefficients for different variables across multiple model specifications.
Methodology:
  3: Cross-country and panel regressions utilizing a new national level precipitation
    statistic incorporating spatial and temporal variability, analyzed with country
    level economic growth statistics. Case studies from the literature.
  4: Assessment of the impact of climate change on global economic growth and specific
    regions/countries, focusing primarily on changes in temperature.
  7: Econometric analysis of national level economic growth and climate data in Sub-Saharan
    Africa.
  8: The review includes case studies and panel studies; methodologies involve econometric
    analysis and cross-country analysis with a focus on SSA.
  11: The paper mentions cross-country regression analysis as a common methodology
    for studying the role of geography and climate in economic development.
  12: Ricardian analysis comparing climate effects on farm income in different countries
    (US, Brazil, and India).
  13: Regression analysis, building on the work of Barrios et al. (2008).
  14: The analysis expands on commonly considered national scale studies by including
    industrial value added to GDP and poverty headcount ratios in addition to agricultural
    production. It utilizes spatially averaged national values for temperature and
    precipitation, and employs an alternative approach to creating a national level
    precipitation statistic that preserves more spatial and temporal information.
  16: The analysis calculates the percentage of grid cells within a country exceeding
    thresholds of the WASP index to represent areas of drought and flooding. It uses
    monthly rainfall data to capture the annual cycle of rainfall, especially important
    for southern Africa where the rainy season spans the end of the calendar year.
  17: Cross-country regressions
  19: "Fixed effects regression using panel data for 42 Sub-Saharan African (SSA)\
    \ countries. Includes time-invariant country-specific effects (\u03B1i) and time-variant\
    \ factors (\u03B5it). Standard errors are clustered and non-clustered at the country\
    \ level."
  20: The study employs both fixed effects and random effects regression models for
    panel data analysis. A Hausman Test is used to determine which model is more appropriate
    for each specification.
  21: "Cross-country regressions using average values over the years 1962 \u2013 2003\
    \ (except Industrial GDP Value Added which uses 1999-2003)"
  22: The analysis uses WASP variables as measures of precipitation variability affecting
    economic growth.
  23: Regressions were performed with Agricultural GDP Value Added and industrial
    GDP as dependent variables to assess the impact of hydroclimate; poverty headcounts
    were also analyzed.
  25: Panel regressions with per capita GDP growth as the dependent variable, fixed
    and random effects identification strategies based on Hausman Tests, applied to
    Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
  26: The analysis uses fixed effects regressions with clustered standard errors,
    preferred for their conservative results.
  27: Cross-country and panel regression analysis in Sub-Saharan Africa using a precipitation-based
    index (WASP) to capture subnational spatial aspects and distinguish between small
    and large rainfall anomalies.
  28: The study uses the WASP index to represent drought and its effects, but not
    flood events; evidence is based on a high correlation with the Palmer Drought
    Severity Index.
  35: Regression with a five-year GDP projection model. The results are applicable
    to time frames that involve 5 year GDP projection
More Notes:
  3: The study focuses on Sub-Saharan Africa.
  8: Rural households face challenges in managing covariant risks related to climate
    variability, affecting economic decisions.
  11: The paper criticizes studies that consider climate by using mean temperature
    and precipitation, omitting the important effect of variability.
  13: The paper recognizes that countries have different vulnerabilities and capacities
    to cope with climate anomalies, particularly developing countries in Sub-Saharan
    Africa.
  16: The paper acknowledges the lack of objective, quantitative data on flood occurrence
    or risk for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and inclusion of such data would improve
    the study. Although strong positive WASP anomalies are representative of flooding,
    the WASP is based on monthly values and floods operate on much shorter timescales.
  17: The paper uses a WASP index, designed to preserve spatial variability of rainfall
    across a country, which is expected to be especially advantageous in large countries
    or in those that cross climate regions.
  19: The identifying assumption is that the effect of the time-invariant country
    characteristics does not change over time.
  20: The paper acknowledges the limitations of fixed effects and the stronger assumptions
    required for random effects. The discussion centers on the statistical methodology
    rather than specific climate change impacts or adaptation costs and benefits.
  27: The drought effect may have a 1-year lag, indicating propagation through agriculture
    to secondary industries.
  29: The study advocates for a portfolio of interventions including improved climate
    information systems, diversification of crops and livelihoods, better water management,
    financial risk transfers, improved market access, and protection from hydrometeorological
    hazards.
