Drivers of Risk:
  1: Higher temperatures, daily temperature variability, extreme precipitation, 2022
    extreme summer heat
  2: Weather conditions, including average monthly temperatures and daily temperature
    variability, leading to inflationary impacts.
  3: Temperature shocks, excess wet conditions, and excess dry conditions.
  4: Ongoing warming and intensification of weather extremes and variability due to
    anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, future temperature conditions.
  5: Increasing average temperatures due to climate change (SSP126 and SSP585 emission
    scenarios) are the primary drivers of inflation pressures.
  6: Increasing average temperatures, amplification of unpredictable heat extremes,
    summer heat extremes, climate change (shifting average conditions, altering the
    intensity and frequency of hot extremes), future summer warming
  7: Summer heat extremes, amplified by future climate change, affecting inflation
    in Europe.
  8: Temperature shocks (higher-than-normal temperatures, especially in hot months
    and countries), Future climate change conditions (warming levels, intensity of
    hot extremes)
  9: Deviations of average temperature, deviations of temperature variability, daily
    precipitation extremes, Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Indices
    (SPEI)
  10: Monthly weather shocks, specifically average temperature and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration
    Index (SPEI) reflecting drought or excess moisture
  11: Future weather conditions under projected climate change, specifically monthly
    average temperatures; 2022 extreme summer heat in Europe.
Highlights:
  1: Higher temperatures increase food and headline inflation; inflation pressures
    are projected to increase under future warming; the 2022 heatwave significantly
    increased food inflation in Europe.
  2: Temperature increases cause nonlinear, persistent increases in food and headline
    inflation, with stronger impacts in hotter months and regions.
  3: Temperature increases cause persistent impacts on food and headline prices, independent
    of baseline climate conditions, over twelve months. Effects of temperature increases
    are consistent across high- and lower-income countries and when accounting for
    different historical inflation volatility. Historical adaptation to temperature
    increases via socioeconomic development has been limited.
  4: Projected global warming would cause persistent upward exogenous pressures on
    inflation of considerable magnitudes already during the next few decades, independent
    of future emission trajectories.
  5: Future warming is projected to put pressure on inflation rates, with impacts
    varying by region, emission scenario, and season. Seasonality of inflation pressures
    is found to be linked to baseline temperature distributions.
  6: Future climate change will amplify the magnitude of heat extremes, thereby also
    amplifying their potential impact on inflation; heat extremes have an impact on
    food inflation, with larger impacts across Southern Europe.
  7: By 2060, extreme heat impacts on inflation in Europe could be amplified by up
    to 200% under a pessimistic emission scenario.
  8: Climate change is likely to alter inflation seasonality, increase inflation volatility
    and heterogeneity, and place persistent pressures on inflation levels. Planned
    adaptation, like space cooling and crop switching, could limit inflationary pressures
    in a changing climate. Without considerable mitigation, pressures on inflation
    would remain persistent and sizeable, even accounting for adaptation.
  9: Impacts on food inflation from mean temperature are qualitatively and quantitatively
    consistent when using World Bank data; the response of headline inflation differs
    considerably, likely due to the inconsistent inclusion of imputed rents.
  10: 'Accounting for linear time trends enhances the magnitude of estimated effects,
    suggesting it assists in removing estimation biases. The study calculates and
    plots cumulative marginal effects (ME) to show the cumulative impact on prices
    from a 1-unit climate shock. '
  11: Evaluates the hypothetical impact on inflation which future weather conditions
    under projected climate change would cause given empirical models. Assesses the
    impacts of the 2022 extreme summer heat in Europe.
Methodology:
  1: Fixed-effects regressions applied to over 27,000 observations of monthly consumer
    price indices worldwide; Results applicable to assessing impacts under temperature
    increases projected for 2035
  2: Uses fixed-effects panel regression models exploiting within-country variation
    based on high-resolution weather data and monthly price indices across 121 countries
    from 1996-2021.
  3: Fixed-effects panel regressions are used on over 27,000 observations of monthly
    price indices and weather fluctuations worldwide over the period 1996-2021. Robustness
    tests include dynamic panel specification, Driscoll-Kraay errors, and controls
    for monetary policy changes.
  4: Empirical models based on historical impacts of weather shocks on inflation are
    used to project future inflationary pressures under different climate scenarios
    from CMIP-6. Considers the impact of future weather conditions on inflation, absent
    unprecedented adaptation, targeted monetary policy response, and interactions
    with macroeconomic developments.
  5: The analysis uses projections from CMIP-6 climate models and a baseline empirical
    specification relating temperature to inflation. Impacts are estimated accounting
    only for increasing average temperatures, absent historically unprecedented adaptation,
    policy response, and macroeconomic interactions. Monthly CPI data is used to assess
    the distribution of inflation pressures across the year. Analysis applicable to
    projected climate change conditions out to 2035.
  6: Empirical results with estimates of monthly temperatures, ERA5 reanalysis of
    historical observations, CMIP-6 climate models projections, empirical response
    functions.
  7: Impacts are analyzed using CMIP-6 climate models and projections under SSP emission
    scenarios, with population weighting for regional aggregation.
  8: Empirical analysis using monthly, non-seasonally adjusted prices across 121 countries
    from 1996-2021, using a first difference in the logarithm of consumer price indices
    (CPI).
  9: Fixed-effects panel regression models are used to identify the causal effects
    of changes in weather variables on national level inflation. Climate data from
    ERA-5 and CRU TS v4.05 are used. The period covered is 1990-2021.
  10: The study uses a regression model with country, date, and country-month fixed
    effects, and country-specific linear time trends to analyze the impact of weather
    variables on inflation. The model includes 11 lags of weather variables. Robustness
    tests include dynamic models with lagged inflation, Driscoll-Kraay errors, monetary
    policy framework controls, and interactions with national income.
  11: Uses CMIP-6 models to project future monthly average national temperatures;
    applies these to an empirical model (Eq. 3) to calculate impacts on inflation.  Averages
    impacts over 30-year periods centered on 2035 or 2060. Also assesses the impact
    of the 2022 extreme summer heat in Europe using ERA-5 estimates of monthly temperatures.
    Considers SSP585 and NGFS scenarios. Impacts are evaluated using Eq. 6.  An uncertainty
    range is presented, accounting for empirical specification, climate model projections,
    and future emission scenarios.
More Notes:
  1: Effects vary across seasons and regions depending on climatic norms; Pressures
    are largest at low latitudes and show strong seasonality at high latitudes, peaking
    in summer.
  3: The paper tests whether adaptation can be seen historically using a moving average
    of temperature over the past 30 years rather than a static 1990-2021 average.
    They also explore the impact of daily precipitation extremes. An alternative price
    index dataset from the World Bank is used for additional testing.
  4: Pressures on inflation are generally larger in the global south. Limited historical
    adaptation to temperature increases. Decisive mitigation of greenhouse gases could
    substantially reduce inflationary pressures. Adaptation via adjustment to changing
    temperatures could substantially reduce future impacts.
  5: The study acknowledges limitations due to the absence of adaptation, policy responses,
    and macroeconomic interactions in the model.
  6: Estimates reflect the exogenous pressure on inflation arising from future weather
    conditions in the absence of historically un-precedented adaptation or policy
    response.
  8: The inflationary impact of temperature shocks depends on baseline climatic conditions.
    Temperature shocks under future climate change would amplify inflation heterogeneity
    and alter the seasonality of inflation. The efficacy and opportunity costs of
    adaptation investments remain largely unknown.
  10: The study uses climate model data from CMIP-6 under SSP585 and SSP126 scenarios
    from 2015-2100. The study considers whether effects are independent of a country's
    national income per capita. Control variables such as employment and economic
    output were excluded due to data availability and a-priori assumption of exogeneity
    between weather and these variables.
  11: "The approach assumes that future warming will shift the mean of the distribution\
    \ of possible summer temperatures and does not account for the potential role\
    \ of changing temperature variability in altering the intensity of future temperature\
    \ extremes. The data have been bias-adjusted and statistically downscaled to a\
    \ common half-degree grid to re\uFB02ect the historical distribution of daily\
    \ temperature and precipitation."

    on average globally; the 2022 extreme summer heat increased food inflation in
    Europe by 0.43-0.93 percentage-points; warming projected for 2035 would amplify
    the 2022 heat effect by 30-50%.

    \ emission scenario by 2035; A range of potential pressures on food inflation\

    \ on average across the world; By 2060, there is a strong and robust difference\
    \ in the average global pressures on food inflation between the highest and lowest\
    \ emission scenarios: 2.1 p.p.p.y. in our central estimate with a range of 1.6-3.8\
    \ across empirical specifications and climate models."

    (average) and standard deviation.
  6: "Anomalous heat over Europe in June, July, and August of 2022 caused a cumulative\
