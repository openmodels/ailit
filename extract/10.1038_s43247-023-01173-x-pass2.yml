Drivers of Risk:
  1: Higher temperatures, daily temperature variability, and extreme precipitation.
  2: Fluctuations in average monthly temperatures, daily temperature variability,
    and precipitation extremes (using the Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration
    Index)
  3: The drivers of risk are temperature shocks (one-off increases in monthly average
    temperature) and extremes in daily precipitation. Excessively wet or dry conditions
    also impact prices.
  5: The primary driver of risk is increasing average temperatures, as projected by
    CMIP-6 climate models under different emission scenarios (SSP126 and SSP585).
  7: Summer temperatures, future warming as projected by CMIP-6 climate models under
    different SSP emission scenarios.
  8: Higher-than-normal temperatures, especially in hot months and countries, lead
    to upward pressure on inflation.
  9: Monthly average temperature, temperature variability, daily precipitation extremes,
    Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at various timescales
    (1, 2, 3, 6, 12 months).
  10: Temperature (average temperature deviations, and extreme temperature deviations),
    precipitation, and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index)
    deviations (both positive and negative).
  11: Future weather conditions under projected climate change (specifically, monthly
    average temperatures), 2022 extreme summer heat in Europe

    temperature conditions projected under future climate change, specifically focusing
    on food and headline price aggregates.

    food and headline inflation.

Highlights:
  1: Higher temperatures increase food and headline inflation persistently over 12
    months in both higher- and lower-income countries. Pressures are largest at low
    latitudes and show strong seasonality at high latitudes, peaking in summer.
  2: Temperature increases cause nonlinear, persistent increases in food and headline
    inflation; The response to average temperature is strongly non-linear, such that
    increases in hotter months and regions cause larger inflationary impacts; Increased
    daily temperature variability causes significant upwards pressures on food and
    headline inflation.
  3: Temperature increases have a persistent impact on food and headline prices. The
    effects of temperature increases are consistent across both higher- and lower-income
    countries. Historical adaptation to temperature increases via socioeconomic development
    has been limited.
  5: Projected temperature increases are stronger in winter in Northern mid-to-high
    latitudes (except Europe) leading to stronger upward pressures in summer contrasting
    weak or downward pressures in winter due to seasonality of temperature. Impacts
    on food inflation are fairly constant across seasons at low latitudes but vary
    considerably across seasons in Northern mid-latitudes, with impacts more than
    twice as large in summer compared to winter.
  7: Extreme heat events are already impacting inflation in Europe, and these impacts
    will be amplified by future warming, particularly under high-emission scenarios.
  8: Climate change is likely to alter inflation seasonality, increase inflation volatility
    and heterogeneity, and place persistent pressures on inflation levels. Temperature
    shocks under future climate change would amplify inflation heterogeneity and alter
    the seasonality of inflation within individual countries. Persistent upward pressures
    on annual food inflation of 1-3 percentage-points per-year could result from temperatures
    projected for 2035.
  9: Impacts on food inflation from mean temperature are qualitatively and quantitatively
    consistent when using World Bank data, but headline inflation differs considerably,
    likely due to inconsistent inclusion of imputed rents in World Bank data.
  10: Accounting for linear time trends enhances the magnitude of estimated effects
    of weather on inflation.
  11: The paper evaluates how future warming could amplify impacts like the 2022 European
    summer heatwave on inflation. It assesses the inflationary impacts from June 2022
    to August 2023 from the three months of temperature in June, July, and August
    of 2022.

Methodology:
  1: Fixed-effects regressions applied to over 27,000 observations of monthly consumer
    price indices worldwide. Results are applicable when considering temperature increases
    projected for 2035.
  2: Fixed-effects panel regression models using monthly price indices for different
    aggregates of goods and services across 121 countries from 1996-2021 combined
    with measures of national exposure to different weather conditions based on ERA5
    data.
  3: The analysis uses fixed-effects panel regressions with over 27,000 observations
    of monthly price indices and weather fluctuations worldwide from 1996-2021. Robustness
    is tested using dynamic panel specification, Driscoll-Kraay errors, and controls
    for monetary policy. The study also examines temperature shocks defined with respect
    to a moving average over the past 30 years.
  5: The analysis uses an empirical specification (column 1 of Supplementary Tables
    S4 & S5) to estimate the exogenous pressure on inflation arising from future weather
    conditions. The results are applicable to the conditions expected by 2035 under
    the specified emission scenarios. The analysis abstracts from adaptation, policy
    response, and macroeconomic interactions.
  7: Empirical analysis using historical data and CMIP-6 climate model projections,
    aggregated using population weighting. Results applicable to Europe, focusing
    on the impacts of summer temperatures on food and headline inflation, in the present
    and projected future (2035 and 2060) under different emission scenarios.
  8: The study uses monthly, non-seasonally adjusted price data from 121 countries
    from 1996-2021. The analysis is performed using regression coefficients. The monthly
    inflation data from the World Bank cross-country database on inflation is alternatively
    used in a robustness test. The study models the heterogeneity across seasons and
    regions using developments and structural changes in the economy. The estimates
    are understood as the likely exogenous pressure on inflation from future climate
    conditions based on the causal relationships inferred from the empirical models,
    in the absence of unprecedented adaptation.
  9: Fixed-effects panel regression models are used to identify the causal effects
    of changes in weather variables on national-level inflation. ERA-5 reanalysis
    data from 1990-2021 is used, along with monthly data for June, July, and August
    2022 for some figures. SPEI is calculated using CRU TS v4.05 data from 1901-2021.
  10: The analysis uses a dynamic panel regression model with country, date, and country-month
    fixed effects, and country-specific linear time trends. The model includes 11
    lags of weather variables to assess delayed effects of monthly weather shocks.
    Robustness tests are performed with various error structures, additional controls
    (monetary policy), and alternative inflation databases. Climate model data from
    CMIP6 under SSP585 and SSP126 scenarios is used for future projections.
  11: Empirical models are used to evaluate the hypothetical impact of future weather
    on inflation. Future monthly average national temperatures are calculated from
    CMIP-6 models and applied to empirical models. The analysis considers climate
    model projections and future emission scenarios, with uncertainty ranges provided.
    Impacts are averaged over 30-year periods centered on 2035 or 2060. Includes a
    trend-preserving method developed by ISIMIP to statistically downscale historical
    temperatures

More Notes:
  1: Effects vary across seasons and regions depending on climatic norms.
  3: The paper finds the strongest and most significant historical weather impacts
    on inflation from changes in average temperature. The study uses SPEI (Standardized
    Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) to account for wet and dry conditions.
  5: The paper uses monthly CPI data to assess the distribution of inflation pressures
    across the year. Seasonally heterogeneous pressures would cause alterations to
    the usual seasonal cycle of food inflation.
  7: The study acknowledges limitations in detecting the impact of precipitation changes
    due to high spatial variability and the use of national-level data.
  8: The study acknowledges that adaptation (e.g., space cooling, crop switching)
    could limit inflation pressures, but considerable mitigation of greenhouse gas
    emissions is still needed. The paper mentions limits to historical adaptation
    observed in the data.
  9: Analysis accounts for spatial variability of precipitation by using gridded population
    estimates from HYDE to estimate national-level exposure to climate variables.
    Deviations of monthly climate conditions from their historical seasonal patterns
    (1990-2021) are used, reflecting the assumption that economies are adapted to
    historical weather patterns.
  10: The study attempts to isolate the impacts of deviations from normal seasonal
    conditions on inflation. The authors acknowledge that they do not control for
    employment and economic output due to data limitations and the potential for these
    to be mediating variables impacted by weather.
  11: The paper emphasizes that the inflation impacts are not projections but an evaluation
    of how climate conditions affect inflation. It also acknowledges that the analysis
    does not account for changing temperature variability altering temperature extremes.
    The methodology holds demographic developments, changes in consumption basket,
    and fiscal and monetary policies constant.

Quantitative material:
  1: Temperature increases projected for 2035 imply upwards pressures on food and
    headline inflation of 0.92-3.23 and 0.32-1.18 percentage-points per-year respectively
    on average globally. The 2022 extreme summer heat increased food inflation in
    Europe by 0.43-0.93 percentage-points which warming projected for 2035 would amplify
    by 30-50%.
  2: "A 1 \xB0C increase in monthly temperature in country-months with a temperature\
    \ of 25 \xB0C causes a cumulative effect on food inflation of 0.17 percentage\
    \ points over the following year."
  3: "A one-off 1\xB0C increase in monthly temperature has a persistent impact on\
    \ food and headline prices. The graphs show cumulative marginal effects in percentage\
    \ points for different baseline temperatures. The paper mentions effects on headline\
    \ inflation in the first month following a shock."
  5: The paper quantifies the pressure on inflation in percentage points per year,
    with error bars indicating the standard deviation across an ensemble of 21 CMIP-6
    climate models. Maps show the spatial distribution of inflation pressure, while
    bar charts compare inflation and calorie intake changes under different scenarios.

    across 121 countries.
  10: The paper presents cumulative marginal effects of climate variables on inflation,
    reflecting the cumulative impact on prices from a 1-unit climate shock. These
    are calculated by summing the lagged coefficients of the regression model.
