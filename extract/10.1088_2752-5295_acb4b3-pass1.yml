Drivers of Risk:
  2: Sea-level rise (SLR) due to climate change; urbanisation concentrating population
    in capital islands; limited land availability in atoll nations.
  5: Sea-level rise (SLR), both minimal and faster rates; Reduced sediment supply;
    Coastal squeeze due to human infrastructure and barriers.
  6: Sea Level Rise (SLR)
  10: Sea level rise (SLR) and extreme wave events lead to increased coastal flooding.
  14: Sea level rise (SLR), Pluvial flooding
  16: Sea level rise (SLR) is the primary driver of risk.
  19: Challenges in managing adverse impacts of land advance, rising temperatures,
    and groundwater salinisation.
  20: Rising sea levels, climate impacts, rising sea temperatures, coral bleaching,
    pressure on emissions from flights.
Highlights:
  2: Structural adaptation through land claim and island raising can sustain atoll
    nations despite SLR, potentially averting forced migration and national abandonment;
    aligning adaptation with existing development trends allows atoll nations to persist
    and prosper.
  5: Protected atolls are more vulnerable to sea-level rise due to reduced sediment
    supply and coastal squeeze, requiring artificial measures to offset the effects;
    Natural atolls can adapt to minimal sea-level rise through natural sediment deposition;
    Faster sea-level rise requires more dynamic sediment activity for natural atolls;
    Maintaining land levels on protected atolls with faster sea-level rise requires
    extreme and costly human intervention.
  10: For tourist islands, land raising/advance is financially viable, particularly
    when timed at the end of a multi-decadal lease period, due to high economic productivity
    and appropriate cost-benefit conditions.
  14: Raising of land is the only way to guarantee that coastal flooding will not
    occur with SLR. A policy of advancing and raising islands can only be effective
    when the movement of people between raised islands is undertaken in a managed
    way. Two of the three urban islands could house two thirds of the current national
    population at present urban densities.
  16: "Strategic island raising, aligned with development trends, provides an adaptive\
    \ approach for the urban area of 'Greater Mal\xE9' and can create land as needed\
    \ for development, reversing the apparent adaptation lock-in of simply reinforcing\
    \ and raising Mal\xE9's seawalls."
  19: Importance of integrating top-down and bottom-up approaches to sustain adaptation
    pathways; freshwater availability is crucial for long-term livelihoods.
  20: Innovative funding and financing methods are needed for adaptation, including
    levies on hotel stays, sand use, and international flights, or higher prices for
    buying advanced or claimed land; Adaptation needs to be suitable for the present
    and over longer timescales; Land advance/raising can be applied more widely.
Methodology:
  2: "Analysis of adaptation pathways involving land claim and island raising, specifically\
    \ in the context of the Maldives and its capital, Greater Mal\xE9; consideration\
    \ of policy, human, physical, engineering, and economic/financial challenges related\
    \ to adaptation."
  5: Illustrative diagram presenting scenarios of sea-level rise impact on atolls,
    comparing natural and protected (with infrastructure) atolls.
  6: The paper proposes an adaptation pathway approach based on engineered land advance
    and raising to allow selected islands to adapt to SLR, consistent with present
    development policies and trends. This considers land use and function, as adaptation
    is highly specific to these needs.
  10: Analyzed adaptation pathways for mitigation and non-mitigation SLR scenarios
    per island and then developed a multi-island adaptation pathway for the capital
    city region. Islands were classified into eight types (later grouped into four
    classes) based on land use and island function, using satellite imagery, observations,
    and discussions. The four classes were then analyzed in terms of engineering design
    conditions, space and material availability, cost-benefit conditions, social acceptability,
    and economic productivity.
  14: Adaptation pathway analysis including island advance and raising, plus population
    migration between islands. Overtopping and inundation analysis.
  16: "The paper proposes an adaptive approach of strategic island raising and population\
    \ migration, particularly for 'Greater Mal\xE9' in the Maldives. This involves\
    \ abandoning, raising, and resettling islands in a cycle to cope with rising sea\
    \ levels."
More Notes:
  2: The paper suggests that a differential approach may be required, with urban islands
    adapting through land claim and island raising, and tourist islands being sustained
    via soft engineering to preserve their natural ambience.
  5: The paper focuses on atolls and illustrates the impact of sea-level rise. The
    text snippet is incomprehensible. The diagram highlights the differential impacts
    of SLR based on the presence of natural adaptation mechanisms versus human infrastructure.
    The paper does not directly quantify macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, but
    suggests that increased human intervention would be needed to maintain land levels
    in protected atolls.
  6: "The paper focuses on the Maldives as a case study, specifically the capital\
    \ city of Mal\xE9 and adjacent urban islands."
  10: The analysis considers migration between islands as a form of adaptation when
    other forms become insufficient. The paper focuses on land advance and raising,
    plus associated movement of people, and does not analyze natural and heritage
    islands.
  14: The paper describes a cycle of abandoning and raising infrastructure, with population
    movement between islands in response to SLR. The details (e.g., island height,
    SLR rate) need to be determined.
  16: "The timing of raising islands like Abadhah-Mal\xE9 depends on future emissions,\
    \ climate sensitivity, ice sheet response, and population growth. The adaptation\
    \ strategy aims to provide flexibility and development opportunities alongside\
    \ improved livelihoods."
