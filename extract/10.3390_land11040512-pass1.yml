Drivers of Risk:
  3: Long-term and short-term climatic factors and the natural production environment
    significantly reduce global agricultural productivity.
  5: Climate change, natural production environment, and socio-economic factors.
  6: Climate variabilities (future climate variabilities are mentioned as impacting
    agricultural TFP change).
  9: Long-term precipitation (LTP), Rainfall variability, Long-term mean temperature
    (LTT), Temperature variability, Regional dummy, Year
  10: Income class of country, land elevation, weather regime/zone, region/geographic
    location. Crop diversification (Herfindahl index).
  11: Crop diversification, Land elevation (and its square), Arid and semiarid climate,
    Tropical and subtropical climate, Rainfall variability, LTT (likely Long Term
    Temperature), Temperature variability, Geographic region (SSA, SA, ECA, LAC, EAP)
  12: Changes in climate variables (30-year moving average of annual mean temperature
    (LTT), 30-year moving average of annual total rainfall (LTP), annual variations
    in total rainfall, annual variations in mean temperature), Land elevation.
  13: Climate variabilities (changes in annual rainfall and temperature, long-term
    precipitation (LTP) and temperature (LTT))
  14: Increasing temperature, rainfall variabilities, changes in climate
  15: Variability in annual mean temperature and annual total rainfall.
Highlights:
  3: Increased level of future climate variability will significantly reduce future
    agricultural productivity.
  5: The main objectives are to jointly identify the influences of climate change,
    natural production environment, and socio-economic factors on global agricultural
    productivity growth and its finer components, and to predict the effect of future
    climate variabilities on global agricultural productivity.
  6: Established linkages amongst climate, production environment and socio-economic
    factors with global agricultural productivity and its efficiency components. Identified
    synergies amongst agricultural productivity and various efficiency components.
  9: Global agricultural TFP grew annually at a rate of 0.44%. Complementary relationships
    exist amongst TFP and its three efficiency components.
  10: High-income countries had the highest TFP change index values.  TFP change index
    is significantly different across the categories tested. Crop diversification
    positively contributes towards TFP growth, technical-, and mix-efficiency changes.
  11: Climate variables (Rainfall variability, LTT, Temperature variability) have
    significant negative impacts on TFP change. Land elevation, Arid/Semi-arid, and
    Tropical/Subtropical climates are significantly associated with TFP change.
  12: Long-term increases in temperature (LTT) negatively impact TFP and its components.
    Long-term precipitation changes (LTP) have mixed effects, negatively affecting
    technical efficiency but positively impacting scale efficiency. Annual temperature
    and rainfall variations negatively impact agricultural performance. Land elevation
    has a complex relationship with TFP and its components, with increasing land elevation
    first increasing TFP, but then reducing it as it increases at an increasing rate.
  13: Increased climate variability is predicted to significantly reduce TFP growth
    in agriculture compared to a counterfactual scenario with no additional climate
    variability. Global agriculture has maintained a positive rate of TFP growth over
    four and a half decades.
  14: Increasing temperature reduces agricultural production and yield. Rainfall variabilities
    also reduce agricultural growth. Changes in climate are likely to have a significant
    growth-reducing role on agricultural TFP.
  15: Growth in TFP components is linked with growth in another, and climatic variables
    significantly impact TFP growth.

Methodology:
  3: "Panel data of 104 countries, covering a 45-year period (1969\u20132013); and,\
    \ \uFB01nally, projects changes in TFP from increased climate variability; F\xE4\
    re\u2013Primont TFP index; multivariate Tobit model"
  5: The study uses TFP and efficiency estimates of Anik et al. [45], which are based
    on a panel data of 104 countries, to identify influences and predict effects of
    future climate variabilities on global agricultural productivity.
  6: "The study utilized estimated values of TFP, technical, scale, and mix-efficiency\
    \ indices from Anik et al. [45], who applied O\u2019Donnell\u2019s [51] F\xE4\
    re\u2013Primont index (FPI) approach. The analysis covers 104 countries where\
    \ agriculture contributed at least 4% of the GDP and/or 4% of total employment,\
    \ covering a period of 45 years (1969\u20132013)."
  7: Forecasting involves assuming explanatory variables follow the historical rate
    of growth observed over the past 45 years (1969-2013).
  9: Estimation of global agricultural TFP indices and components. Use of a 30-year
    moving average for long-term climate variables (precipitation and temperature).
    Application of the MVTOBIT model to estimate the determinants of TFP change and
    its efficiency components.
  10: The study uses geometric means to analyze TFP and its components across different
    country categories. A one-way ANOVA test was conducted to determine if the TFP
    change index was significantly different across categories.  Econometric analysis
    was performed to understand whether the growth in TFP and its three components
    across countries belonging to different income classes is different.
  11: MVTOBIT (multivariate tobit) model is used to estimate the determinants of TFP
    change and its components.
  12: The analysis uses regression models to estimate the marginal effects of climate
    variables, agroecology, weather regimes, and other factors on TFP and its components
    in agriculture. The time period or geographical scope isn't specified in this
    text.
  13: A Multivariate Tobit (MVTOBIT) model is used to predict TFP up to 2033 under
    four different climatic scenarios.

  3: Technological progress and mix-efficiency change drive agricultural productivity
    growth.
  9: Regional dummies are included to account for differences between Sub-Saharan
    Africa (SSA), South Asia (SA), Latin America and Caribbean (LAC), East Asia and
    the Pacific (EAP), and Europe and Central Asia (ECA), with Middle East and North
    Africa (MENA) as the base.
  10: The study categorizes countries based on World Bank income classifications.
    The time variable implies that technical-, scale-, and mix-efficiency grew significantly
    over time.
  11: The base categories for income class and geographical location are upper-middle
    income countries and MENA region, respectively.
  13: The analysis classifies countries into arid/semiarid, temperate, and tropical/subtropical
    zones, with regional differences in TFP and its components (technical efficiency,
    scale efficiency, and mix efficiency). The likelihood of TFP increase is significantly
    higher in tropical and subtropical zones compared to the temperate zone, and arid/semiarid
    regions show higher TFP and scale efficiency changes than the temperate region,
    while mix efficiency change was higher in the temperate zone than arid/semiarid
    zones. The likelihood of increase in TFP and its efficiency components is significantly
    higher in these regions compared to the base region, MENA.
  14: Agricultural spending for R&D is critical for adapting to climate change.

Notes:
  7: The predictions involve creating a 'counterfactual' scenario considering natural
    growth rates and additional changes in climatic variables.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Global agricultural productivity growth (TFP)
  5: Agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) growth and its finer components
    (technical-, scale-, and mix-efficiency changes).
  6: Agricultural productivity (specifically TFP - Total Factor Productivity) and
    its efficiency components (technical, scale, and mix efficiency).

    change, Mix Efficiency change.
  11: 'TFP (Total Factor Productivity) Change Index and its components: Technical
    Efficiency Change Index, Scale Efficiency Change Index, Mix-Efficiency Change
    Index'
  12: Total Factor Productivity (TFP), technical efficiency change, scale efficiency
    change, and mix efficiency change in agriculture.
  13: Total Factor Productivity (TFP)
  14: Agricultural TFP (Total Factor Productivity) growth or reduction
  15: Future TFP projections indicate growth-reducing effects from climatic variabilities.
Quantitative material:
  3: Global agricultural productivity grew consistently at a rate of 0.44% p.a.
  6: The study provides the magnitude and direction of agricultural TFP change from
    future climate variabilities.
  9: Global agricultural TFP grew annually at a rate of 0.44%, and the estimated level
    was 0.20. Global technical efficiency level was estimated at 0.91, scale efficiency
    level at 0.97, mix-efficiency level at 0.78, residual-scale-efficiency level at
    0.37, and residual-mix-efficiency level at 0.29.
  10: Table 3 provides geometric means of TFP change and its components (Technical,
    Scale, and Mix Efficiency) for different country categories. For example, low-income
    countries had a TFP Change Index of 1.001, while high-income countries had an
    index of 1.236. A 1% increase in crop diversity index will increase the likelihood
    of an increase in TFP, technical-, scale-, and mix-efficiency by 0.585%, 0.031%,
    and 0.074%, respectively.
  11: Table 4 provides coefficients (marginal effects) and significance levels for
    various drivers on TFP change and its components, from a MVTOBIT model. E.g.,
    a 1% increase in spending is associated with a 0.043 increase in the TFP Change
    Index (significant at 1%).
  12: 1% increase in LTT is associated with a likelihood of a 0.056%, 0.011%, and
    0.013% decrease in TFP, technical-, and mix-efficiency change indices, respectively.
    1% increase in LTP is associated with a likelihood of 0.021% reduction and 0.004%
    increase in the technical- and scale-efficiency change indices, respectively.
  13: Table 5 provides predicted TFP index values for 2033 under different climate
    scenarios, compared to a 2013 baseline. The predicted TFP is higher in 2033 than
    in 2013 across all scenarios, but the increase is lower when additional climate
    variabilities are considered. The mean difference in TFP between the counterfactual
    model (no additional climate variability) and other models show a significant
    reduction in TFP with additional climatic variabilities.
