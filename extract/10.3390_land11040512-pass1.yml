Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate, environment and socio-economic drivers
  3: Long-term and short-term climatic factors and the natural production environment
  4: Changing climate and weather patterns are identified as increasing concerns for
    agriculture and livelihoods globally.
  7: The study uses a sensitivity analysis to predict future TFP under different climatic
    scenarios, implying that climatic variables are considered drivers of risk.
  10: The production environment, specifically land elevation and weather regime/zone
    (arid/semiarid, tropical/subtropical, temperate), impacts TFP change and its components.
  11: Rainfall variability (negative impact on TFP change), Long-term Temperature
    (LTT) (negative impact on TFP change), Temperature variability (negative impact
    on TFP change), Land Elevation and Arid and semiarid climates, Tropical and subtropical
    climates have positive impacts.
  13: The drivers of risk are climate variabilities, specifically annual rainfall
    and temperature variabilities (LTP and LTT, which stand for Long Term Precipitation
    and Long Term Temperature based on footnote).
  16: Increasing temperature and volatility in climatic variables are adversely affecting
    TFP (Total Factor Productivity) growth.
Evaluation overview:
  1: global agricultural productivity growth
  3: Global agricultural productivity growth, specifically Total Factor Productivity
    (TFP)
  4: Agricultural Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth is evaluated for its impact
    on food production, sustainability, and poverty reduction.
  5: The study aims to identify the influences of climate change, natural production
    environment, and socio-economic factors on global agricultural productivity growth.
  7: The paper evaluates agricultural Total Factor Productivity (TFP) change and its
    components (technical efficiency, scale efficiency, and mix-efficiency).
  9: The paper provides an overview of global agricultural Total Factor Productivity
    (TFP) change and its components.
  10: The paper evaluates Total Factor Productivity (TFP) change and its components
    (technical efficiency, scale efficiency, and mix-efficiency).
  11: Evaluates the determinants of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) change and its
    components (Technical Efficiency Change, Scale Efficiency Change, and Mix-Efficiency
    Change).
  13: The paper evaluates Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in agriculture as an outcome.
Highlights:
  1: No relevant information
  3: Increased climate variability will significantly reduce future agricultural productivity.
  4: Increased TFP can ensure increased agricultural production, while reducing environmental
    externalities, increasing resilience, and ensuring sustainability.
  5: The study seeks to jointly analyze the impacts of climate change, natural production
    environment, and socio-economic factors on agricultural productivity and to predict
    future climate variabilities' effect.
  7: The study predicts changes in global agricultural TFP up to 2033 under different
    climatic scenarios.
  9: The global technical efficiency level was estimated at 0.91, scale efficiency
    level at 0.97, mix-efficiency level at 0.78, residual scale efficiency level at
    0.37, and residual mix-efficiency level at 0.29.
  10: High-income countries had the highest TFP change index values compared to other
    income classes. TFP change indices across all categories are significantly different
    at a 1% level of significance. Crop diversification positively contributes towards
    TFP growth, technical-, and mix-efficiency changes.
  11: Climatic variables like rainfall variability, LTT, and temperature variability
    have significant negative impacts on TFP change. Land elevation and certain climate
    zones (arid/semiarid, tropical/subtropical) have positive impacts.
  13: Global agriculture has maintained a positive TFP growth rate over four and a
    half decades. Additional climate variabilities will significantly reduce TFP from
    its natural rate of change. TFP and its efficiency components increased significantly
    over the years.
  16: Country and region-specific research and policies to mitigate and adapt to climate
    change should have top-most priority. Governments, international donors, development
    partners, and private sectors need to contribute to bring about required changes
    in the agricultural future. Individual farmers also have an important role to
    play.
Methodology:
  1: No relevant information
  3: "Panel data of 104 countries, covering a 45-year period (1969\u20132013); F\xE4\
    re\u2013PrimontTFPindex; multivariate Tobit model"
  4: Examination of TFP change allows decomposition of total production growth into
    various components (technology, efficiency, and scale changes) to identify specific
    sources of productivity growth.
  5: The authors use TFP and efficiency estimates from Anik et al. based on a panel
    data of 104 countries to achieve the objectives.
  7: A multivariate Tobit model (MVTOBIT) is applied to identify the determinants
    of agricultural TFP and its efficiency components. Future TFP is predicted using
    the predict command in STATA 16 software, with explanatory variables forecasted
    using annual compound growth rates estimated from historical data (1969-2013).
    The out-of-sample prediction covers 2014-2033.
  9: The analysis is performed using a 30-year moving average starting from 1901 for
    long-term precipitation and temperature, and the MVTOBIT model is applied to estimate
    joint determinants of TFP change.
  10: The analysis uses a one-way ANOVA test to determine significant differences
    in the TFP change index across categories.
  11: Uses a Multivariate Tobit (MVTOBIT) model to estimate the determinants of TFP
    change and its components. Results applicable to the studied agricultural production
    systems and regions.
  13: An MVTOBIT model is used to predict TFP up to 2033 under four different climatic
    scenarios. The baseline year is 2013, and the model uses data from 1969 to 2013.
More Notes:
  1: The paper is published in the journal *Land* by MDPI.
  3: Technological progress and mix-efficiency change drove productivity growth, with
    negligible contributions from technical- and scale-efficiency changes. Socio-economic
    factors also have a significant influence.
  4: Declining agricultural productivity and cereal crop failure in food-exporting
    economies contributed to the global spike in food prices during 2008-2009 and
    are likely to be repeated with higher intensity due to climate anomalies.
  9: The page suggests complementary relationships exist amongst TFP and its components,
    as correlations were found to be positive and significantly different from zero.
  10: The time variable suggests technical-, scale-, and mix-efficiency grew significantly
    over time.
Quantitative material:
  1: No relevant information
  3: Global agricultural productivity grew consistently at a rate of 0.44% p.a.
  7: The paper predicts change in global agricultural TFP up to 2033 using parameter
    estimates from the MVTOBIT model.
  9: The global TFP grew annually at a rate of 0.44%, and the geometric mean of TFP
    change index for the last four and a half decades was 1.014.
  10: Table 3 provides geometric means of TFP change and its components for different
    country categories based on income, land elevation, weather regime/zone, and geographic
    location.
  11: Provides marginal effects of various variables on TFP change and its components,
    with significance levels indicated.
  13: Predicted TFP in 2033 is significantly higher than in 2013 across all climate
    scenarios. The counterfactual model (no additional climate variabilities) shows
    a higher increase. Additional climate variabilities reduce TFP by 0.009% to 0.440%
    compared to the counterfactual.
