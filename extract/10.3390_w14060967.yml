Drivers of Risk:
  1: Floods causing business interruption and asset damage.
  3: Inundation period and inundation depth
  4: Floods, driven by river discharge, water depth, and flood extent. Meteorological
    forcing data (precipitation, temperature, wind speed) from reanalysis and bias-corrected
    GCMs.
  5: Floods
  7: Flooding events (inundation period and annual maximum inundation depth) are the
    primary driver of risk.
  8: Floods, specifically the annual maximum inundation depth.
  10: The analysis implicitly considers floods as a driver since it compares BI loss
    data related to flood protection.
  11: Floods (specifically inundation periods due to shallow slopes).
  13: River flooding, economic growth.
  14: Floods are identified as the primary shock impacting BI losses, with additional
    references to heavy rain and landslides.
  15: Floods are the main driver of risk discussed. The presence or absence of flood
    protection significantly impacts the level of BI loss and asset damage.
  16: The primary driver of risk is the occurrence of floods, with consideration given
    to the level of flood protection.
  17: Floods exceeding flood protection levels (FPL).
  18: Floods with large return periods and long inundation periods, especially in
    river basins with mild slopes or flat terrains, and the impact of climate change
    are key drivers.
  19: Floods are identified as a major driver of risk in assessing BI losses and asset
    damage.

  20: Direct and Indirect Economic Losses Caused by a Flood With Long-Lasting Inundation
Highlights:
  1: "Future projection under RCP8.5 and SSP3 scenarios shows BI loss and asset damage\
    \ per GDP may increase by 0.32% and 1.78% (2061\u20132090 average) compared with\
    \ past period (1971\u20132000 average)."
  3: Application of bias-corrected atmospheric forcing is expected to improve the
    representation of river hydrodynamics simulations, including daily inundation
    depth and extent.
  7: BI loss is defined as the loss caused by the inability of people to perform work
    due to workplace destruction or inaccessibility. The BI period is assumed to be
    proportional to the inundation period, with a constant of 2 applied in this study.
  10: Significant discrepancies were noted between this study's BI loss estimations
    and World Bank values in some cases, such as Thailand 2011 and Moldova 2010.
  11: High GDP contributes to high BI loss in some regions (America and Europe). Prolonged
    inundation periods due to mild slopes result in high BI loss in other regions
    (Tigris, Euphrates, Chao Phraya, and Yellow Rivers). Relative BI loss is smaller
    in countries with high GDP.
  13: Significant increases in BI loss and asset damage are projected due to river
    flooding, particularly in Asia and Africa, with substantial impacts on GDP.
  15: Flood protection significantly reduces both BI loss and asset damage, but has
    a greater effect in reducing BI loss.
  16: Flood protection has a greater effect on BI loss than on asset damage. The effectiveness
    of flood protection varies depending on the level of protection, with higher protection
    levels leading to greater reductions in both the number of floods and the ratio
    of BI loss to asset damage.
  17: The ratio of BI loss to asset damage tends to be greater in river basins with
    low FPL, but simulations show future ratios will be high even in large river basins
    with high FPL. The BI loss to asset damage ratio is also expected to increase
    in most parts of China, India, and central Africa, as well as regions of Europe
    and America with high FPL.
  18: BI loss is not negligible in flood risk estimation and is projected to exceed
    1.5% of local GDP in some flat terrain river basins under future scenarios.
  19: This is the first study to estimate BI loss due to floods globally and compare
    it to direct asset damage.
Methodology:
  1: Utilizes a global river and inundation model with bias-corrected meteorological
    forcing to estimate BI loss and asset damage.
  3: Flood simulations and a gridded GDP dataset are used to calculate BI loss and
    asset damage based on inundation period and inundation depth. Bias-corrected meteorological
    forcing data is used in the Catchment-based Macro-scale Floodplain (CaMa-Flood)
    model. Applicable for estimating flood impacts.
  5: Gridded GDP is derived according to the weighted distribution of country GDP
    with respect to building height data. The relationship between subnational GDP
    ratio and subnational building ratio is estimated using data from 11 countries
    (319 subnational data points) and applied globally.
  6: "The study derives gridded GDP from gridded building height data using a linear\
    \ relationship (g_GDP = (0.9634 \xD7 g_bldratio + 0.0011) \xD7 country GDP). It\
    \ uses World Bank Open Data (2010 values) to determine the percentage of primary\
    \ industry GDP and assumes the rest is from secondary and tertiary industries.\
    \ For missing data, the global average is used. Assets are assumed to be 2.8 \xD7\
    \ GDP in urban areas and equal to GDP in other areas."
  7: BI loss is calculated based on the inundation period, gridded GDP, and the GDP
    ratio of secondary and tertiary industries, assuming no daily production occurs
    during inundation periods. BI period is estimated as a linear recovery after inundation.
    Flooding is calculated when daily total storage exceeds a current flood protection
    standard.
  8: "Asset damage is calculated by multiplying asset value (derived from GDP and\
    \ an asset coefficient) by the damage fraction, which is based on a damage\u2013\
    depth function that considers different regions (continents based on World Bank\
    \ classification) and sectors (residential, commercial, industrial, transport,\
    \ infrastructure, and agriculture).  The maximum inundation depth is used to calculate\
    \ asset damage."
  10: The methodology involves comparing this study's calculated BI loss aspects with
    World Bank estimations for validation.
  11: Uses bias-corrected S14FD-GCM forcing data, S14FD-Reanalysis data, and output
    from CaMa-Flood driven by S14FD-GCM, averaging values from five GCMs. Compares
    changes in the percentage of BI loss to GDP over time with changes in asset damage
    relative to GDP.
  13: GCM simulation results, comparing 1971-2000 with 2021-2050 and 2061-2090.
  14: The analysis uses reanalysis simulation results to estimate BI loss due to floods
    from 1960 to 2013 and compares it with asset damage estimates.
  15: The analysis uses reanalysis simulation results with and without flood protection
    to estimate BI loss and asset damage, and compares those to find the effect of
    the protection. Results are applicable from 1960 to 2013.
  16: The analysis uses reanalysis simulation values to determine the ratio of BI
    loss to asset damage. It targets four river basins (Yangtze, St. Lawrence, Senegal,
    and Niger) and analyzes the relationship between the ratio of BI loss to asset
    damage and the number of floods, defined as years where maximum inundation depth
    exceeds flood protection levels.
  18: "A method was developed to estimate global flooding-related BI loss; historical\
    \ simulations used data from 1960-2013 and future projections for 2061\u20132090."
  19: The analysis was performed using the Global river model CaMa-Flood.

    than country-level data. The GDP data is based on 2005 PPP USD.
  8: The validation dataset includes the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) and World
    Bank data. Reports are targeted from secondary and tertiary industries.
  15: The analysis is presented at both a global and continental scale. Figure 6 illustrates
    the spatial distribution of BI loss to asset damage as a percentage.
  17: The scatter plot indicates the relationship between flood frequency and business
    interruption across different regions, factoring in asset damage percentages.
    The world map illustrates the global distribution of BI loss relative to asset
    damage.
  20: Focuses on flood risk, specifically the 2011 Thailand flood and a flood in Germany

    BI period (BIP), annual production (AP), and number of days per year (Nd); also
    includes equation (4) to calculate BIP
  8: Provides asset damage estimates in USD 2005 PPP for specific flood events in
    Namibia (2009, 56 million), Moldova (2010, 5.34 million), Pakistan (2010, 1.21
    billion), and Pakistan (2011, 121 million).
  10: The page contains quantitative comparisons of BI losses in specified countries,
    such as Namibia, Moldova, Pakistan, Thailand, Malawi, and Nigeria.
  11: BI loss exceeded USD 50 million (2005 PPP) in certain regions. BI loss was USD
    < 1 million (2005 PPP) in other regions. Amazon, Congo, Shebelle, Niger, Indus,
    Diamantina and Chao Phraya River basins had values > 0.3% of GDP BI loss. America
    and Europe had a relative BI loss of <0.1% of GDP.
  13: Percentage of BI loss relative to GDP expected to increase by >1.0% in drainage
    areas of the Nile and Niger Rivers.
  14: The ratio of BI loss to asset damage from flood events averaged globally at
    20.6%, with regional variations highest in Europe (26.9%) and lowest in South
    America (6.1%) from 1960 to 2013.
  15: Global annual total BI loss and asset damage averaged from 1960 to 2013 without
    flood protection were USD 1864 billion and USD 3771 billion (2005 PPP), respectively.
    Flood protection led to BI loss and asset damage reductions of 98.6% and 96.5%,
    respectively. The ratio of BI loss to asset damage decreased by an average of
    30% with flood protection compared to without flood protection.
  16: The analysis provides ratios of BI loss to asset damage (in percentages) with
    and without flood protection for different continents and specific river basins.
    For example, the ratio for Africa without flood protection exceeds 50%, while
    with protection it is around 25%. In the Yangtze basin, flood protection reduces
    the ratio from 131.3% to 33.0%.
  17: Future BI loss to asset damage ratios exceeded 15% in most parts of Africa.
    The Mississippi River basin (FPL > 50 years) is projected to see a 17.3% increase
    in the BI loss to asset damage ratio relative to past values.
  18: "Projected future increases in BI loss and asset damage per GDP by 0.32% and\
    \ 1.78% (2061\u20132090 average) under RCP8.5 and SSP3 scenarios."
