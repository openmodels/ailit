Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global warming, socioeconomic changes, and inaccurate meteorological data leading
    to inaccurate inundation extent and period estimates.
  2: Flood events (historical and projected under warmer climate), flood hazard, exposure,
    vulnerability, inadequate flood protection, meteorological forcing data bias
  3: Floods causing interruptions in business activity and destruction of physical
    assets.
  4: River flooding due to climate change.
  5: Flood damage estimation potentially affects macroeconomic outcomes by impacting
    GDP.
  6: Building height (g_bldratio) used as a proxy for economic activity; the implicit
    climate-related risk is that climate change can damage buildings and infrastructure.
  7: Inundation period and workplace inaccessibility due to floods.
  8: Floods caused by heavy rainfalls, drainage system failures, and breaches of embankments
    and dams leading to widespread damage.
  9: Heavy rainfalls causing river and flash floods are the primary drivers of risk.
  10: Floods (river basin drainage area > 5000 km2) and power outages.
  11: Flooding (specifically prolonged inundation periods due to shallow slopes),
    high GDP areas also experience high BI loss.
  12: Climate change impacting flood frequency and intensity.
  13: Future BI loss due to climate-related events affecting river basins
  14: Heavy rain and floods causing landslides and infrastructure damage, leading
    to BI loss.
  15: Floods and lack of flood protection.
  17: The primary driver of risk is the occurrence of floods, exacerbated by inadequate
    flood protection levels (FPL). Climate change is an implicit driver leading to
    changes in flood patterns.
  18: Climate change leading to increased flood frequency and magnitude, long inundation
    periods, mild river basin slopes, Flood Plain Level (FPL)
  19: Flood (specifically, river flood).
  21: Climate change (anthropogenic warming); Flooding (coastal and river).
Highlights:
  1: Flood-related business interruption (BI) loss is a significant component of economic
    losses from floods, comparable in magnitude to reported historical flood losses.
  2: BI loss can be as extensive as asset damage (e.g., 2011 Thailand floods); Previous
    studies focused on asset damage, current study focuses on BI loss and compares
    it to asset damage; Focus on modeling to improve estimates of BI loss due to flood;
    recent availability of bias-corrected meteorological data enables direct simulation
    of daily inundation depth
  3: Assessment of BI loss and asset damage due to floods and their impact using advanced
    flood and economic data modeling.
  6: Gridded GDP is related to country GDP via building height, with a high correlation
    (0.91) found between building height and GDP.
  7: BI period is derived from surveys on past floods across different regions; results
    in a simplified globally applied constant for BI period estimation.
  8: Severe floods leading to significant financial losses across different regions,
    impacting multiple sectors such as infrastructure, industry, commerce, and transportation.
  9: The study validates the CaMa-Flood model's ability to reproduce general trends
    of global flood risk and compares simulated BI loss with reported values from
    the World Bank.
  10: The study's method of calculating asset damage is deemed sufficiently accurate
    based on comparisons with previous studies. Visual representation of BI loss across
    different regions is provided.
  11: BI loss as a percentage of GDP varies significantly across river basins, with
    some basins experiencing losses more than double the global average. Higher absolute
    BI loss does not necessarily translate to a higher percentage of GDP loss, especially
    in regions with high GDP.
  12: Significant projected increases in global annual BI loss and asset damage due
    to climate change, with losses and damages increasing much more quickly than increases
    in GDP.
  13: Projected significant increases in BI loss and asset damage, with marked economic
    impacts on specific regions such as China, Thailand, the Nile River basin, and
    Sub-Saharan Africa
  15: Flood protection significantly reduces both BI loss and asset damage. BI loss
    can exceed 100% of asset damage in some areas.
  17: BI loss to asset damage ratios are expected to be high even in large river basins
    with high FPL in the future. The ratio is projected to increase in many regions,
    including parts of China, India, central Africa, Europe, and America.
  18: BI loss is not negligible in global flood risk estimation. Projected risk changes
    with local FPL and flood magnitude.
  19: The study provides the first global scale estimate of Business Interruption
    loss due to flooding and discusses its importance relative to direct asset damage.
  21: Increased human and economic losses from river flooding with anthropogenic warming.
Methodology:
  1: Global river and inundation model driven by a bias-corrected meteorological forcing
    scheme to estimate BI loss and asset damage.
  2: Flood risk assessments calculating population and GDP exposure based on flood
    return periods; overlaying GDP exposure and inundation depth hazard; using depth-damage
    function to represent vulnerability; simulating daily inundation depth using bias-corrected
    meteorological forcing data (S14FD); modeling framework to estimate flood-related
    global asset damage and BI loss
  3: Uses flood simulations combining gridded GDP dataset, bias-corrected meteorological
    data, land surface model, inundation model, and damage modeling.
  4: Uses CaMa-Flood for flood simulation, forced by runoff from MATSIRO. Uses S14FD-Reanalysis
    and S14FD-GCM for atmospheric data. GLCNMO data used for urban area calculations.
    GRUMPv1 and FLOPROS data used for aggregation at national and subnational levels.
    Applicable for global-scale flood risk analysis.
  5: Gridded GDP determined via multiplication of GDP per capita by gridded population
    data and adjusted using building height data as a proxy for GDP distribution.
  6: Gridded GDP is estimated based on the relationship between gridded building height
    and total building height within a country. GDP ratios for secondary and tertiary
    industries are derived by subtracting the percentage of primary industry GDP from
    1 (using World Bank data or global average if data is missing). Assets are estimated
    as a multiple of GDP.
  7: Calculation of inundation period and BI loss using grid-based GDP and GDP ratios
    of industries; BI period modeled as proportional to overflow flood water depth
    and downscaled storage data.
  8: Asset damage estimation using maximum flood depth and damage-depth functions;
    validation with EM-DAT and World Bank data.
  9: The study uses the CaMa-Flood model to simulate asset damage and business interruption
    loss. It conducts reanalysis (1960-2013) and GCM simulations using S14FD-Reanalysis
    and S14FD-GCM datasets with GDP data. Future impacts are estimated under RCP8.5
    (2006-2098) and SSP3.
  10: Asset damage estimation is compared to previous studies for validation. BI loss
    is calculated and spatially distributed according to river basin drainage area.
  11: Analysis used bias-corrected S14FD-GCM forcing data, S14FD-Reanalysis data,
    and output from CaMa-Flood driven by S14FD-GCM. Average values produced by five
    GCMs were used to compensate for uncertainties.
  12: Comparison of historical GCM simulation results with reanalysis data (constrained
    by past meteorological observations) for validation. Estimation of future BI loss
    and asset damage using GCM simulations for near-term (2021-2050) and long-term
    (2061-2090) periods, compared with past period (1971-2000).
  14: Reanalysis simulation results comparing the relative impacts of BI loss and
    asset damage on regional economies.
  15: Reanalysis simulation with and without flood protection, comparing BI loss and
    asset damage.
  17: The analysis uses simulations to estimate future BI loss and asset damage ratios
    in different river basins, comparing scenarios with and without flood protection.
    The results are applicable to understanding regional vulnerabilities to flood-related
    economic losses.
  18: Developed a method to estimate flooding-related BI loss on a global scale, future
    flood risk projection using RCP8.5 and SSP3 scenarios
  19: Global river model CaMa-Flood model is used.
  21: Integration of spatial and computable general equilibrium modelling to assess
    direct and indirect economic impacts of floods; Data-mining approach using tree-based
    methods for flood damage assessment; Use of global flood depth-damage functions.
More Notes:
  1: BI loss tends to be greater in river basins with mild slopes and long inundation
    periods.
  4: The study relies on pre-existing datasets and models (CaMa-Flood, MATSIRO, S14FD,
    GLCNMO, GRUMPv1, FLOPROS) and focuses on simulating flood inundation and calculating
    asset damage and BI losses, but this page alone doesn't provide specific quantitative
    results on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  5: The study assumes proportionality between building height and GDP per capita,
    applying it globally based on data from 11 countries.
  6: The provided links give information on National Economics and Social Development
    Board (Thailand), Federal Statistical Office (Germany), Brazilian Institute of
    Geography and Statistics (Brazil), Chinese Statistical yearbook (China), Cabinet
    Office, Government of Japan (Japan), Statistics South Africa (South Africa), and
    Central Bank of Chile (Chile). The analysis relies on the assumption that building
    height is a reasonable proxy for economic activity at a gridded level.
  7: The proportional constant for BI period is based on limited regional examples
    and should be refined with more data.
  9: Losses are converted to USD (2005 PPP) for consistency, but this conversion faced
    challenges due to missing data. The study accounts for flood protection measures
    in some countries when estimating losses.
  10: The study focuses on long-term averages. Comparison of BI losses due to power
    outages with World Bank estimates for select countries.
  11: The paper focuses on flood-related economic loss and uses the concept of 'Business
    Interruption (BI) loss' as a key metric.
  12: The results are based on global data, not national-level data. The validation
    uses PPP-adjusted 2005 USD, allowing for comparability across countries.
  15: The analysis uses 2005 PPP values. The analysis is performed at a regional/continental
    scale, and the Malawi example shows the impact can be very different at a national
    scale.
  17: The effectiveness of flood protection measures in reducing BI loss varies significantly
    across different river basins.
  18: Estimation values are first order and have uncertainties related to model, dataset,
    and methods. Improvements are needed for BI period estimation and spatial asset
    distribution.
  19: The study acknowledges limitations in applying its methods in limited areas
    and emphasizes the need for more globally applicable methods.
  21: The references focus heavily on flood-related risks and methodologies for assessing
    damage and economic impacts. This suggests a focus on adaptation strategies related
    to flood management.
