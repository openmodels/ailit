  8: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Drought characteristics (frequency, duration, and intensity) across Africa under\
    \ four SSPs (shared socioeconomic pathway) scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0,\
    \ and SSP5-8.5 spanning three designated periods: 2021\u20132040 (near-term),\
    \ 2041\u20132060 (mid-term), and 2081\u20132100 (long-term)."
  8: Decrease in precipitation and increase in Potential Evapotranspiration (PET)
    leading to drought conditions.
  10: Changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) are drivers
    of drought, impacting dry conditions.
  14: Increased drought duration and intensity driven by different emission scenarios
    (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5).
  15: Projected intensification of drought across Africa, with different regions experiencing
    varying levels of severity over different time periods.
  18: Continuous aridity projected for Africa and its sub-regions due to climate change.
  19: Rising temperatures and increased evaporation leading to increased dryness and
    drought.
  21: Projected changes in precipitation (decreases in NAF, SAH, and SAF; increases
    in Africa overall, WAF, CAF, and EAF) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) across
    Africa due to climate change under high emission conditions.
Highlights:
  1: The insights derived from this study could provide a foundational basis for devising
    effective drought adaptation strategies in Africa.
  8: Bias correction improves model performance for precipitation simulation. The
    multi-model ensemble mean (after bias correction) effectively captures the precipitation
    pattern across Africa.
  10: "African precipitation is expected to increase, especially during 2081\u2013\
    2100 under SSP5-8.5, but with regional disparities: NAF, SAH, and SAF show declining\
    \ trends, while WAF, CAF, and EAF are expected to experience heightened precipitation.\
    \ PET across Africa is increasing, especially in medium-to-high emission scenarios."
  14: Africa is likely to face more severe and longer-lasting droughts than the historical
    period under all emission scenarios by the end of the 21st century. Drought severity
    has increased across the African continent in all scenarios and future time frames.
  15: There is a worrying pattern of increasing drought severity, particularly in
    northern and southern Africa, under various SSP scenarios.
  18: A worrisome trend of continuous aridity projected for Africa and its sub-regions.
  19: The African region is expected to face increased dryness, particularly in Sub-Saharan
    Africa and the Southern region, while wetter conditions are foreseen in the Northern
    region.
  21: Long-term drought conditions across Africa are anticipated to become less frequent,
    yet more prolonged and severe. Each sub-region is projected to experience more
    severe drought conditions.
Methodology:
  1: "This study employs twenty GCMs from CMIP6 to investigate hydrological drought\
    \ characteristics... The (SPEI) at a 12-month scale and employs bias correction\
    \ on the multi-model ensemble mean extracted from GCMs of the CMIP6 project via\
    \ cumulative distribution function (CDF). Mann\u2013Kendall approach was implemented\
    \ for trend and the SPEI-12-based drought trend from 1979 to 2014 displays a negative\
    \ trajectory of \u2212 0.05/a for Africa..."
  8: Evaluation of 20 CMIP6 GCMs in simulating precipitation and PET in regional African
    climate from 1995-2014. Uses a multi-model ensemble (MME) and metrics like distance
    correlation (rd), bias (B), and variability (A). Taylor diagram technique and
    Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) are used for evaluation.
  10: "Analysis of African drought patterns from 1979 to 2014 assessing duration,\
    \ frequency, and intensity using SPEI-12. Projections are made using SSP scenarios\
    \ for precipitation and PET changes relative to the historical period 1995\u2013\
    2014 for different timeframes (2021\u20132040, 2041\u20132060, 2081\u20132100)."
  14: The study uses the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)
    to project dryness or wetness changes. The results are applicable to the time
    periods 2021-2040, 2041-2060, and 2081-2100 under various SSP scenarios.
  18: "Analysis of 20 chosen CMIP6 GCMs to assess drought attributes across Africa.\
    \ The SPEI drought index is used to measure drought duration and severity. Future\
    \ projections are given for time horizons 2021\u20132040, 2041\u20132060 and 2081\u2013\
    2100 under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios relative to the\
    \ historical period."
  21: Uses CMIP6 projections under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios;
    employs CDF matching method to correct biases; utilizes the E model metric to
    evaluate model performance; statistical downscaling of model outputs; analyzes
    gridded observational data from 1979 to 2014; reference period 1995-2014; SPEI-12
    and Mann-Kendall trends are used.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on hydrological drought characteristics and does not directly
    quantify macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, but could be used in further work to
    model those variables.
  8: The study focuses on the African climate and the performance of climate models
    in simulating precipitation and PET. The relevance to macroeconomic and macro-fiscal
    risks lies in the fact that changes in precipitation and PET can lead to drought
    conditions, which can have economic consequences, although this is not explicitly
    addressed on this page.
  10: The graphs show bias correction of climate models for precipitation and PET
    data.
  14: The page references figures (9 and 13 a-g) containing box plots that visually
    represent SPEI changes across different regions and scenarios.
  18: The study anticipates less frequent, longer durations, and more intense droughts
    from the near to higher emission scenarios in the late twenty-first century over
    African sub-regions.

Quantitative material:
  1: "Africa\u2019s droughts are predicted to last 6, 8, and 13 months, significantly\
    \ longer than the usual 4-month period. As the historical events of 17 times is\
    \ anticipated to drop to 6, 5, and 3 times, respectively."
  8: "Before bias adjustment, precipitation MME: variability (A =0.1623), bias (B\
    \ =0.2677), distance correlation (rd =0.0529), E =0.0023. After bias adjustment,\
    \ precipitation MME: variability (A =0.9645), bias (B =0.9761) and distance correlation\
    \ (rd =0.0594), E = 0.0559. Before bias, PET MME: variability (A =0.7964), bias\
    \ (B =0.0349), distance correlation rd (=0.1594), and E (E =0.0044). After adjusting\
    \ for bias, PET MME variability (A =0.6501), bias (B = 0.3841), and distance correlation\
    \ (rd=0.1588), with E performing marginally better (E =0.0391). Biases in precipitation\
    \ were 12.52% before bias and 4.53% after bias, while PET showed biases of \u2212\
    11.10% before bias and 5.74% after bias."
  10: 'Decreasing trend in SPEI-12 at -0.05/a annually from 1979 to 2014. Regional
    declining trends from 1979 to 2014: NAF (-0.06/a), SAH (-0.05/a), WAF (-0.01/a),
    CAF (-0.02/a), EAF (-0.06/a), and SAF (-0.03/a).'
  14: Projected average drought durations (in years) for different African regions
    under various SSP scenarios for the periods 2021-2040, 2041-2060, and 2081-2100.
    These are specified in the text and visually represented in figure 9 and figure
    13 a-g.
  15: "Projected drought intensities are provided for various regions of Africa, ranging\
    \ from -2.1 to -3.0 in different periods (2021\u20132040, 2041\u20132060, 2081\u2013\
    2100)."
  18: "During 1995\u20132014, Africa exhibited a severe dryness index of around -1.9.\
    \ Future scenarios project even drier conditions, with extremely dry levels below\
    \ -2.11, -2.60, and -2.79 across all SSPs scenarios in the periods 2021\u2013\
    2040, 2041\u20132060, and 2081\u20132100 respectively. Intensified drought conditions\
    \ were detected in sub-regions like NAF, SAH, WAF, CAF, EAF, and SAF, with corresponding\
    \ indices of -2.01, -2.29, -2.17, -2.13, -1.92, and -1.73."
  21: Drought duration is projected to increase from 7.3 years (2021-2040) to 16.4
    years (2041-2060) and 16.6 years (2081-2100). Drought frequency is expected to
    decline from 6.4 times (near-term) to 3.6 times (long-term). Drought intensity
    is projected to escalate from -1.9 (historically) to -2.6 events (long-term),
    with some sub-regions reaching as high as -3.0 events under SSP5-8.5.
