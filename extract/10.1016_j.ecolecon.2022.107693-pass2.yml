Drivers of Risk:
  1: Exposure to hurricanes measured by maximum wind speed
  2: Hurricanes (measured by maximum wind speed).
  3: Hurricane wind exposures.
  4: Hurricane exposure (measured by an index Sct, based on maximum windspeed affecting
    a county during a storm)
  5: "Disaster shocks, measured by a storm index (\U0001D446\U0001D450\U0001D461)\
    \ varying at the county level for each month."
  6: Storm exposure (disaster shock exposure by county).

    0.084).

    and wage dynamics which can be impacted by climate change.

    those changes.

Highlights:
  1: Hurricanes cause a short-run employment decrease; employment effects are heterogeneous
    across industries; input-output linkages help explain industrial adjustments.
  2: Hurricanes have heterogeneous effects across industries, with some industries
    (e.g., Construction of Buildings, Specialty trade contractors) showing employment
    increases ('strengthened industries') and others (e.g., Accommodation, Scenic
    and Sightseeing Transportation) showing employment decreases ('weakened industries').
    Input-output linkages may explain some of the industry-level results, with employment
    increase positively correlated to the share of output sold to the construction
    sector for the strengthened industries.
  3: Provides novel evidence on the short-run employment effects in a lower-income
    setting (Puerto Rico). The study uses a continuous exposure index to examine employment
    adjustments across industries. The analysis reveals the importance of input-output
    linkages as a driving mechanism of the employment effects of natural disasters.
  4: The paper focuses on the impact of hurricane exposure on employment in Puerto
    Rico, leveraging a detailed dataset. There is substantial variation in hurricane
    exposures across counties and over time.
  6: Impulse response functions of employment follow a pattern broadly similar to
    the baseline results regardless of data treatment. For wages, including zeros
    and using non-interpolated data causes wage responses to flip sign from positive
    to negative compared to baseline.
  9: Hurricanes have different effects on employment depending on the industry. Some
    industries experience positive employment effects (e.g., construction), while
    others are neutral or weakened. The study classifies industries as 'strengthened,'
    'neutral,' or 'weakened' based on employment effects.
  10: Natural disaster shocks lead to a construction boom and negatively affect retail,
    transport, and accommodation industries. Input-output linkages play a key role
    in the transmission of disaster shocks to employment across different industries.
    A sectoral analysis may lead to an aggregation bias.
  12: Natural disasters lead to an average decline in employment, but with heterogeneity
    at the industry level. Input-output linkages explain some of this heterogeneity.
    Adaptability-driven employment resilience, defined as the potential for workers
    to reallocate to expanding industries, is a potential strategy.

    industries.

Methodology:
  1: "Panel local projections using monthly data for 70 3-digit NAICS industries and\
    \ 78 Puerto Rican counties over the period 1995\u20132019"
  2: Local projections are used to explore the dynamic employment effects of hurricanes,
    regressing cumulative changes in variables of interest on a disaster shock variable
    at each horizon, controlling for pre-trends and seasonal effects. The analysis
    is performed using county-level data in Puerto Rico.
  3: Uses local projections to examine the economic impacts of hurricanes, examining
    employment adjustments across industries. The analysis considers all counties
    in Puerto Rico and all hurricanes that occurred over the sample period.
  4: The paper uses local projections to explore the dynamic employment effects of
    hurricane exposure. Hurricane exposure is measured using an index that accounts
    for maximum wind speed in each county during a storm.
  5: Local projections are used to estimate the impact of disaster shocks on economic
    outcomes. The method involves running k-step ahead panel predictive regressions,
    controlling for past values of the outcome variable, time and county fixed effects,
    and county-industry specific fixed effects and industry-time fixed effects. The
    sample period is 1995M1 to 2019M11 for 78 counties (GEO).
  6: "Panel data analysis using county and industry-level data. Linear interpolation\
    \ is applied to 8% of industry\u2013county\u2013time employment and wage observations\
    \ where zeros reflect non-disclosure. Baseline results are presented excluding\
    \ zeros, both with and without linear interpolation. Analysis also performed including\
    \ all zeros, with and without interpolation."
  8: The study uses county-time and county-industry-time variation to analyze the
    dynamic effects of hurricanes on employment and wages at different time horizons.
    They use linear interpolation in some specifications. Panel data analysis is used
    to generate impulse response functions (IRFs).
  9: The study uses industry-time variation to analyze the dynamic effects of hurricanes
    on employment. It appears to use impulse response functions (IRFs) to show the
    effects over time. The analysis is applicable to the period 1995-2019.
  10: Local projections, regression analysis. Analysis is applicable to the US economy.
    Robustness checks include different measures of exposure to natural disasters,
    different windspeed calculation methods (Depperman formula), using geographical
    centroids instead of population-weighted centroids, industry-specific exposure
    measures, and controlling for past hurricanes.
  12: Analysis uses monthly data for 70 3-digits NAICS industries and 78 Puerto Rican
    counties over the period 1995-2019. Local projections are used, controlling for
    past and future disaster exposure. Industry-specific exposure to hurricanes is
    calculated as a weighted average of county-level exposure, using industry employment
    weights.

More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the short-run, dynamic employment effects of hurricanes
    in Puerto Rico.
  2: The paper introduces the concept of 'adaptability-driven employment resilience,'
    defined as the potential for workers to reallocate from contracting to expanding
    industries after a natural disaster. This concept could be important for 'post-disaster
    resilience.'
  3: The study focuses on Puerto Rico, a lower-income setting, and uses a different
    (continuous) measure of storm exposure.
  4: The study uses employment data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages
    (QCEW).
  8: "The analysis covers 70 industries. The time horizon for the dynamic effects\
    \ extends to 12 months. The coefficient (\U0001D6FE\U0001D456) and its standard\
    \ error are reported."
  9: Appendix E contains a table classifying industries (S, N, or W) based on employment
    effects at different time horizons (3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months).
  14: The results are specific to selected Transport Industries and the period 1995-2017.
  15: The table provides a list of hurricanes with associated data, but it does not
    contain any analysis of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes or adaptation costs/benefits.

  16: The industry-level breakdown in Tables C.2 and C.3 could be useful for assessing
    the vulnerability of different sectors to climate change impacts.
  17: The data appears to be specific to Puerto Rico ("Municipio" is similar to County).
    The relevance to a global review depends on whether Puerto Rico can serve as a
    case study or if the drivers of these labor force changes are generalizable to
    other national contexts under climate change scenarios. Labor force change is
    used to show what locations are experiencing relative declines or growth.
  23: Results are specific to a 64-knot hurricane threshold.
  26: The analysis explores the impact of hurricanes using different levels of granularity
    (county-time and county-industry-time).

  29: The analysis focuses on the dynamic effects of hurricanes at time *t*.
  30: The results are for selected industries and control for lags and leads of the
    exposure measure.
