  30: Industry employment
Highlights:
  1: "Substantial heterogeneity in the employment responses across industries. Employment\
    \ increases in some industries while in others employment decreases after a hurricane.\
    \ This heterogeneity can be partly explained by input\u2013output linkages."
  2: Hurricanes have heterogeneous effects across industries, with some industries
    (e.g., construction) experiencing employment increases and others (e.g., accommodation,
    scenic and sightseeing transportation) experiencing employment decreases. Input-output
    linkages may explain some of the industry-level results.
  3: The study focuses on a lower-income setting (Puerto Rico), uses a continuous
    measure of storm exposure, and examines employment adjustments across detailed
    industries to reveal the importance of input-output linkages.
  4: The paper highlights the substantial variation in hurricane exposures across
    counties and over time in Puerto Rico. Different hurricanes impact different parts
    of the island.
  5: Landfall is not a necessary condition for an island to be impacted, as some areas
    further away from the eye of the hurricane may experience strong winds and thus
    positive exposures.
  6: The paper addresses the issue of reported zeros (40% of total observations) in
    county-by-industry level data and uses linear interpolation on an additional 8%
    of observations where zeros reflect non-disclosure.
  7: Hurricanes lead to a temporary decline in employment, with effects peaking six
    months after the event and disappearing thereafter. Industries can be divided
    into strengthened and weakened groups based on employment responses. The average
    wage response to the hurricane shock is positive between the first and fourth
    quarters.
  8: The heterogeneity in the employment response to natural disasters can be found
    even within 2-digits sectors. Some industries are 'strengthened', some are 'weakened'
    and some are 'neutral' following a hurricane.
  9: 'Some industries experience positive employment effects from hurricanes (implied:
    construction), while others are classified as ''neutral'' (Air and Water transportation)
    or ''weakened'' (Transit and ground passenger transportation, and Scenic and sightseeing
    transportation). The importance of using detailed industry data to better gauge
    employment effects is highlighted.'
  10: Sectoral analysis of employment response to hurricanes is important due to differential
    responses across industries. Input-output linkages play a key role in the transmission
    of disaster shocks to employment across different industries; a positive correlation
    exists between the share of construction sectors as buyers of industry output
    and the employment response to hurricane impacts. Results suggest a construction
    boom after disasters, negatively affecting retail, transport, and accommodation
    industries.
  11: The table identifies specific industries that are strengthened, neutral, or
    weakened, and the magnitude and statistical significance of the impacts.
  12: "Natural disasters lead to an average decline in employment but mask heterogeneity\
    \ at the industry level, which can be explained by input\u2013output linkages.\
    \ Some industries contract while others expand following natural disasters. Adaptability-driven\
    \ employment resilience, defined as the potential opportunity for workers to reallocate\
    \ from contracting to expanding industries, is suggested."

Methodology:
  1: "Panel local projections using monthly data for 70 3-digits NAICS industries\
    \ and 78 Puerto Rican counties over the period 1995\u20132019. Outcomes are examined\
    \ up to two years post-hurricane."
  2: The paper uses local projections to explore the dynamic employment effects of
    hurricanes, regressing cumulative changes in variables of interest on a disaster
    shock variable at each horizon. Controls for pre-trends and seasonal effects are
    included.
  3: The study uses local projections to examine the economic impacts of hurricanes,
    employing a continuous treatment to account for differences in storm exposure.
    It considers all counties in Puerto Rico and all hurricanes occurring over the
    sample period (1995-2017).
  4: "The paper constructs an index of exposure to hurricanes (\U0001D446\U0001D450\
    \U0001D461) using windspeed data, weighting windspeed by population. It also uses\
    \ local projections, running predictive regressions to explore dynamic employment\
    \ effects. The analysis uses data from 1995-2017."
  5: The paper uses local projections to estimate the impact of disaster shocks. They
    run k-step ahead panel predictive regressions (equations 2 and 3). The sample
    period runs from 1995M1 to 2019M11, with data for 78 counties. They analyze county-time,
    county-industry-time, and industry-time variation.
  6: Panel data analysis for 78 counties and 70 3-digit industries using monthly data
    from 1995M1 to 2019M11; linear interpolation used to address missing data due
    to non-disclosure
  7: Panel regressions with Newey-West corrected standard errors at the industry level,
    equation (4) regresses change in industry employment on exposure to disaster,
    pre-trends, and monthly dummies, considers a two year horizon at monthly or quarterly
    frequency.
  8: "The analysis exploits county-time variation and county-industry-time variation\
    \ to assess the dynamic effects of hurricanes on employment and wages at different\
    \ time horizons (up to 12 months). Linear interpolation is used in some specifications.\
    \ Industries are classified as 'strengthened', 'weakened', or 'neutral' based\
    \ on their employment response to the disaster shock. The size of the coefficient\
    \ (\U0001D6FE\U0001D456) and its standard error are reported."
  9: "Analysis exploits industry\u2013time variation to assess dynamic effects of\
    \ hurricanes on employment at different horizons. IRFs (impulse response functions)\
    \ are generated. Industry classifications (S, N, or W) are proposed in Appendix\
    \ E for different time horizons."
  10: Local projections are used to estimate the impact of hurricanes on employment.
    Robustness checks include varying windspeed thresholds, using the Depperman formula
    for windspeed, using geographical centroids instead of population-weighted centroids,
    building industry-specific measures of exposure, and controlling for past hurricanes.
  11: The analysis seems to be a regression-type model based on the coefficient and
    standard error information provided. The results are applicable for a 12-month
    horizon.
  12: "The study uses monthly data for 703-digits NAICS industries and 78 Puerto Rican\
    \ counties over the period 1995\u20132019 to study the short-run, dynamic employment\
    \ effects of natural disasters. Local projections are used to capture the effect\
    \ of hurricanes. An industry-specific measure of exposure to hurricanes is calculated\
    \ using a weighted average of county-level exposure, with weights based on industry\
    \ employment in each county."
  14: "Exploiting industry\u2013time variation."
  15: Data on people affected, total fatalities, and total damages come from the EM-DAT
    database.
  20: Exploits county-industry-time variation with/without linear interpolation using
    county*industry and industry*time fixed effects. Dynamic effects are evaluated
    at different horizons.
  21: 'The table classifies industries (NAICS codes provided) based on their sensitivity
    to climate at different time horizons (3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months). Four different
    classification models are used: Baseline model, 64-Knots threshold, Deppe formula,
    and Non-weighted centroids. The classifications use ''W'' to indicate weather-sensitive
    and ''N'' or ''S'' for not weather-sensitive.'

More Notes:
  1: The study focuses specifically on hurricanes in Puerto Rico.
  2: "The paper introduces the concept of 'adaptability-driven employment resilience'\
    \ as the potential for workers to reallocate from contracting to expanding industries\
    \ after a disaster. The paper uses data at the county\u2013time, county\u2013\
    industry\u2013time, and industry\u2013time level."
  3: The study aims to be more general than previous research by considering all counties
    and hurricanes in Puerto Rico over the specified period, unlike studies that focus
    on one hurricane and a few counties.
  4: The windspeed is normalized to a measure between 0 and 1, and cubic powers account
    for the force exerted by winds on physical structures. A threshold of 33 knots
    defines a tropical storm.
