Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, COVID-19, inequality, environmental degradation, dysfunctional
    political systems
  5: Identified 334 PESTEL drivers of change, including 71 economic and 60 environmental
    drivers, to understand the factors impacting potential future scenarios.
  6: Climate change effects; prioritization of environmental factors over economy;
    reliance on natural resource extraction; political instability; corruption; lack
    of sustainability criteria in economic investment; neglect of climate change
  9: Environmental degradation, climate disasters, dependence on international funding
Highlights:
  1: The study aims to identify how LAC countries can build long-term resilience,
    focusing on adaptability to climate change risks, considering sustainable development
    challenges and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recommendations for policymakers
    and decision-makers to achieve sustainable futures for LAC are provided.
  6: The table presents four scenarios with varying levels of socioeconomic prosperity
    and resilience to climate change. Scenario I represents the best case with sustainable
    development and inclusive growth. Scenario III represents the worst case with
    deprived socioeconomic conditions and no resilience to climate change.
  8: The futures' methodology workshops show common ground regarding pressing needs
    and opportunities for action, consistent with the interconnectedness of the region's
    issues and the urgency for cooperation. Four scenarios of socioeconomic recovery
    and climate change resilience were developed. The analysis identified 50 action
    priorities across the LAC countries, compiled in six public policy groups.
  9: Regulation around climate change is urgent, migrating from voluntary recommendations
    towards mandatory requirements. Need to strengthen existing laws and monitoring
    mechanisms. Incentive fostering proper economic recovery and adequate mitigation
    and adaptation strategies for climate change and biodiversity loss. Tax reform
    allowing both national and local governments to finance their public policies.
  10: The paper presents general actions applicable across countries in the region
    to achieve desired futures, emphasizing cooperation at national and international
    levels. It acknowledges the need for participatory, bottom-up approaches due to
    the differences in desired outcomes and contexts between and within LAC countries.
Methodology:
  1: In-depth qualitative futures study, scenarios planning, backcasting
  5: Focus groups conducted with multi-stakeholder participation using online platforms
    due to COVID-19; analysis involved scenario planning and back-casting for macroeconomic
    and climate resilience futures.
  6: Backcasting scenarios for Latin American and Caribbean countries
  8: Futures methodology workshops were implemented in seven different countries in
    Latin America and the Caribbean. National teams provided data and analysis, including
    emerging categories and alternative clustering not initially considered. Data
    was coded using Atlas.ti and MS Excel, with a code list prepared a priori comprising
    16 code groups and 309 codes, which were expanded to 413 with national coding.
    The scenarios resulted from a comparative and overlapping analysis of scenario
    narratives proposed by the research partners from the seven countries participating
    this study.
  9: Participatory futures methodologies workshops, with experts from different stakeholder
    groups
  10: Scenario building workshops were conducted with 269 participants across 7 Latin
    American and Caribbean countries. Four scenarios were created, narratives developed,
    and action opportunities identified for public and private sectors, academia,
    and civil society.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region and includes
    specific case studies from Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, Mexico, Chile, and
    Jamaica.
  6: The scenarios consider the interplay between public and private sectors, the
    relationship with the natural environment, and societal mindsets.
  8: The study identifies regulatory policies, incentives, and disincentives related
    to climate action as key policy tools.
  9: The regional economy depends greatly on agriculture, mining, and living stock,
    different technologies and agreements that allow the exploitation of natural resources
    without compromising the economy must be considered.
  10: The study focuses on climate action and achieving sustainable and regenerative
    futures for Latin America and the Caribbean. It identifies policy and action opportunities,
    but doesn't provide specific macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes or quantitative
    data.
No relevant information:
  3: This page does not contain information on specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes,
    quantitative data, or specific costs/benefits of adaptation measures. It primarily
    discusses futures studies methodologies and their application in Latin America
    and the Caribbean.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic aspects are mentioned as being detrimentally affected by COVID-19 and
    relevant to building long-term resilience.
  6: Economic development; socioeconomic recovery; unemployment; poverty; life quality;
    green jobs; green investment; competitiveness; fiscal targets
  9: Economic recovery, mitigation and adaptation strategies for climate change and
    biodiversity loss, socioeconomic growth
Quantitative material:
  6: No quantitative information.
