Drivers of Risk:
  1: Disasters
  5: Natural disasters
  6: Inflation, wealth, population growth.
  8: Changes in number and value of dwellings, building regulations, and natural disasters.
  9: Floods (28.9%), severe storms (26.2%) and cyclones (24.5%) are the most costly
    disaster types in Australia.
  11: Severe storms, floods, cyclones, bushfires, and heatwaves are identified as
    significant drivers of economic loss in Australia.
  13: Natural disasters (earthquake, extreme temperature, storms, floods, landslides,
    drought and bushfires)
  14: Natural disasters (bushfires, drought, etc.).
  15: Meteorological disasters, natural disasters (including heatwaves and earthquakes),
    tropical cyclones, floods, thunderstorms, and bushfires.
  18: Natural disasters, specifically variations in how they are recorded and underinsurance.
  19: Natural disasters, specifically including drought.
  20: Disasters (unspecified types).
  21: Cyclones, hailstorms, earthquakes, floods, and bushfires
  22: Tropical cyclones, severe storms, floods, hailstorms, earthquakes, and bushfires.
  24: Natural disasters such as severe storms, floods, tropical cyclones, bushfires,
    earthquakes, and landslides in Australia are identified as hazards with varying
    economic impacts.
  25: Bushfires identified as a significant hazard to human life in Australia.
  27: Severe storms, bushfires, and tropical cyclones affecting different Australian
    states.
  28: Bushfires (specifically, the Ash Wednesday 1983 bushfires).
  29: Not explicitly mentioned on this page, but implied to be related to events covered
    by the ICA database and other sources.
  30: Bushfires (specifically Ash Wednesday bushfires).
  32: Increasing wealth, population and density
  35: No relevant information
Highlights:
  5: Major difficulties in providing a full economic analysis stems from a lack of
    data, poor data quality, lack of precise definition of cost categories, vague
    or variable temporal and geographical limitations, limited loss indicators, irregular
    frequency of updates and a lack of reliability assessment; Insurance data only
    represents a fraction of the total cost of a disaster because it only includes
    insured losses.
  6: Normalisation adjusts losses to allow for valid comparisons over time; Without
    normalisation, comparisons might be dominated by growth in inflation, wealth and
    population, rather than underlying changes in disaster losses; The procedure applied
    influences results of trend analysis considerably.
  7: A significant factor influencing conclusions is the cost categories captured
    in the data used, with insurance industry data (a subset of direct costs) underlying
    several analyses.
  8: No observable trends in disaster losses over time once building number, value
    and standards have been accounted for. The 1999 Sydney hailstorm is now reported
    as the most costly disaster for insured losses in Australia.
  9: The average annual cost of disasters to Australia between 1967 and 1999 was $1.75
    billion (2013AUD).
  10: The report is the most comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of total economic
    loss from disasters in Australia as of the time of the report.
  11: The paper suggests the cost of heatwaves in Australia may be significantly underestimated
    and highlights the need to address these costs due to expected increased frequency.
  13: Guha-Sapir, Hargitt and Hoyois (2004) report provides disaggregated information
    for countries and aims to highlight regions that are most vulnerable to disasters,
    calculated as total economic cost and cost as a proportion of GDP, as well as
    reporting number of deaths and people affected.
  14: Australia experiences significant economic losses from natural disasters, averaging
    $1.65 billion (2013AUD) annually. The EM-DAT disaster database is a frequently
    referenced international database used to track disaster trends.
  15: Australian average annual weather-related damage, average annual cost of disasters
    to Australia, tropical cyclones and floods account for the majority of fatalities
    from natural disasters.
  18: Different disaster databases have significant discrepancies in the number of
    disasters recorded and how costs are allocated, making it difficult to get a realistic
    view of disaster frequency, severity, and economic impact. There is a call for
    streamlining of disaster recording globally to make them comparable.
  19: Different databases provide significantly different estimates of the average
    annual cost of natural disasters in Australia due to different data sources and
    collection methodologies.
  20: Different methodologies for estimating disaster losses (particularly the use
    of multipliers and normalization procedures) result in significantly different
    estimates. Insurance loss estimates in Australia primarily focus on residential
    losses and fail to account for government and industry losses.
  21: Disaster loss estimates are highly influenced by data methodology and sources.
    Large disasters in Australia include Cyclone Tracy (1974), the Sydney hailstorm
    (1999), Newcastle earthquake (1989), Queensland floods (1974), and the Ash Wednesday
    bushfires (1983).
  22: The ranking and estimated cost of disasters varies depending on the metric used
    (insured vs. total losses) and the source of the data.
  24: Over 50% of deaths between 1967 and 2013 in Australia were caused by heatwaves,
    indicating significant human costs.
  25: Bushfires were the most hazardous disaster type to human life in Australia after
    heatwaves.
  27: Different data and methodologies can lead to profoundly different estimates
    of the loss associated with the same event. The ICA database estimates losses
    (insured losses only) from the Ash Wednesday bushfires in Victoria and South Australia.
  28: Stephenson [19] includes monetized benefits (government payments, donations,
    insurance) as economic benefits. BTE [5] attempts an analysis from the perspective
    of the whole economy.
  29: Provides several estimates of the economic costs associated with events in Victoria
    and South Australia, broken down by different loss categories and sources.
  30: Insurance data is a conservative estimate of losses, representing only a fraction
    of overall losses. Full economic impact assessments result in much higher estimates
    but still lack many potential loss items due to lack of available data. There
    are wide variations in cost estimates due to different data sources and methodologies.
  32: Continued and expanded investment in disaster risk reduction is firmly established.
  35: No relevant information
Methodology:
  1: Comparison of disaster cost estimates
  5: "Disaster cost estimates are drawn from the Insurance Council of Australia\u2019\
    s (ICA) Historical Disaster Statistics or insurance data with some augmentation."
  6: Time-series analysis, normalisation (adjusting losses by removing the influence
    of socio-economic changes).
  7: The paper compares four domestic reports (Bureau of Transport Economics, Handmer
    et al., Blong, and Crompton) and one international report (Guha-Sapir et al.)
    evaluating the economic loss of weather-related disasters in Australia. Data is
    adjusted to 2013 dollars using the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) inflation calculator
    to facilitate comparisons. The study emphasizes that direct measurement between
    reports is not possible due to differing methodologies but cautious comparison
    highlights how data and methodology influence conclusions.
  8: Normalisation of Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) data for events from 1966-2011,
    controlling for changes in number and value of dwellings, as well as building
    regulations. Limited by reliance on household insurance data only.
  9: The BTE report used data from the Emergency Management Australia (EMA) database
    (now EM Knowledge Hub) and adjusted their data for inflation, but not for changes
    in wealth or population, prior to analysis.
  10: The analysis uses a database (AUS-DIS) that examines economic costs of natural
    disasters in Australia from 1967 to 2013, with a costing framework including insured
    loss, estimated total loss, and the value of loss of life and injury.
  11: The AUS-DIS database includes events costing more than $10 million, normalized
    to 2013 dollars, or with three or more lives lost; it is based on multiple sources
    and includes direct, indirect, and intangible losses.
  13: Guha-Sapir, Hargitt and Hoyois (2004) summarize the impacts of disasters globally
    over 30 years. The report does not explain how total losses were calculated, only
    that they were 'adjusted' to US 2003 dollars.
  14: The paper discusses different disaster databases (EM-DAT, AUS-DIS, Risk Frontiers)
    used to track economic and human losses from global disasters.
  15: The studies use various databases (Insurance Council of Australia Natural Disaster
    Event List, EMA database, AUS-DIS, Risk Frontiers database) and methods (normalisation
    for population, wealth, inflation, building standards; reliability rating of data
    sources).
  18: Comparison of different disaster databases (ICA, EM Knowledge Hub, AUS-DIS)
    and analysis of their limitations in data collection.
  20: Estimates of full economic costs of disasters were derived using a multiplier
    applied to insurance data. Crompton normalizes for the size, location and number
    of new dwellings in an area and for population and GDP. Handmer, et al. is normalised
    with respect to CPI, population growth and real GDP growth.
  21: Normalization of insured losses, total normalized losses (insured and reported),
    and House Equivalent (HE) losses.
  22: Compares disaster loss rankings and magnitudes using normalised insured losses,
    normalised total losses, and 'house equivalents' losses from different reports.
    Normalisation aims to account for changes in wealth and population over time.
  27: The paper compares different assessments (from ICA database, EM Knowledge Hub,
    BTE report, and others) of the same event (Ash Wednesday bushfires) to highlight
    how data and methodology lead to different estimates of loss.
  28: Several economic assessment frameworks are used (Stephenson [19]). BTE [5] applied
    principles from their report on the Ash Wednesday fires to conduct an economic
    analysis. Methodologies include consideration of direct and indirect costs and
    monetization of losses.
  29: Economic analysis from various sources; use of insurance claim data; augmentation
    of insured loss estimates with media reports.
  30: The paper compares different cost estimates from various sources (insurance
    data, full economic impact assessments, legislative assembly statements, Munich
    Re data) and discusses the limitations of each methodology. The estimates are
    adjusted for inflation only.

More Notes:
  1: This page is from an accepted manuscript, not the final published version. Errors
    may be present.
  5: Payments from insurance can be classified as a benefit rather than a loss or
    cost; ICA database was no longer available online as of mid-2015.
  7: The paper mentions that other databases like Munich Re exist but are not directly
    compared in this context due to the need for purchase.
  8: The ICA database was the most internally consistent and reliable estimate of
    insured losses to Australian households from natural disasters before being removed
    mid-2015, but only includes household insured losses, which represent a subset
    of direct and tangible costs. Some events, such as floods, are often not insured
    for in Australia.
  9: The EM Knowledge Hub is utilized by many researchers because it is freely available
    and contains a large depository of statistics on Australian disasters.
  13: 'The Risk Frontiers database spans 1788 to present, and is the most comprehensive
    for fatalities and damage to buildings in Australia, although it is not publicly
    available. The database has limitations: reliance on newspaper reports, underestimation
    of building damage, and incomplete records.'
  14: The quality of data in EM-DAT varies depending on national and institutional
    data collection approaches. The AUS-DIS database seeks to overcome limitations
    of the EM-DAT.
  15: The studies differ in their data sources, inclusion of non-insured losses, and
    normalization methods, which leads to variations in the estimated costs of disasters.
  18: The ICA focuses on insured disasters, potentially underrepresenting the true
    costs, as many disasters are underinsured or not insured at all. AUS-DIS may underestimate
    the number of disasters but accounts for economic loss from each disaster. One
    study concluded that there was an increasing trend in the number of natural disasters
    per year over time (BTE [5], with Handmer et al., [26]).
  19: ICA significantly underestimates the total economic cost of disasters in Australia.
  20: The paper discusses the use of the statistical value of life figures in disaster
    cost estimates in Australia.
  21: The number of large disasters may be increasing, but this may be due to better
    reporting and knowledge of what to include when calculating total loss. Inclusion
    of intangible and indirect losses increases the overall cost of a disaster.
  22: The paper normalizes losses to 2013 AUD million to allow comparison across different
    years. It acknowledges that earlier disasters with less comprehensive analysis
    may appear less costly.
  27: The page focuses on individual event loss assessment, specifically the 1983
    Ash Wednesday bushfires. It acknowledges that southern states are more affected
    by severe storms and bushfires, while northern states are more affected by tropical
    cyclones.
  28: Different estimates should be understood differently based on what is included
    (e.g., gross vs. net loss, types of costs included). Some estimates, like the
    EM Knowledge Hub [14], have unclear origins.
  29: The data seems primarily focused on costs (losses). The Stephenson [19] entry
    is unusual in that it considers benefits (insurance) in its analysis.
  30: Economic estimates of disaster costs suffer from a lack of availability or reporting;
    poor data quality; temporal and geographical limitations; lack of regularity of
    updating and maintenance; and little or no reliability analysis.
  32: The cost estimates presented are considered a conservative 'first pass' and
    should include heatwaves, indirect and intangible losses.

No relevant information:
  2: The provided page is primarily an abstract and introductory information. It focuses
    on the lack of standardized methods for recording disaster costs, but it does
    not provide any quantitative information or specific analyses of macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal outcomes related to climate change and adaptation at a national
    level.
  17: This page focuses on comparing disaster databases and does not provide specific
    quantitative information on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, adaptation costs
    and benefits, or the methodology used to assess them. It mainly discusses the
    discrepancies in disaster reporting across different databases (AUS-DIS, BTE,
    EMA Knowledge Hub, ICA, EM-DAT) due to varying aims and inclusion criteria, such
    as economic damages versus human losses. There is no information about macroeconomic
    risks of climate change or costs and benefits of adaptation at a national level,
    only about differences in disaster reporting.

Quantitative material:
  5: Insurance cost data is used as a standardized proxy.
  8: Average Australian annual weather-related (normalised) insured losses to be $1.22
    billion (2013AUD), with the last 10 years averaging $1.52 billion (2013AUD). The
    last 10 years of the 45-year dataset accounts for 25% of the overall losses.

    billion (2013AUD). If Cyclone Tracy (1974), the Newcastle earthquake (1989) and
    the Sydney hailstorm (1999) are removed the average annual cost declines to $1.32
    billion (2013AUD). Floods (28.9%), severe storms (26.2%) and cyclones (24.5%)
    are the most costly disaster types. Bushfires accounted for 7.1% of the total
    cost of disasters in Australia, 223 deaths (39.5%) and over 4,000 injuries (57.4%)
