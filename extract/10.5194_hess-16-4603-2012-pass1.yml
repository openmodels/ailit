Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change altering monsoon patterns and increasing temperature, and hydropower
    reservoir operations.
  8: Climate change impacts on temperature, precipitation, and runoff, as well as
    reservoir operations.
  11: Climate change (A1b and B1 emission scenarios), reservoir operations
  15: Climate change and reservoir operations in the Mekong River Basin
Highlights:
  1: Reservoir operations are likely to have a larger impact on the Mekong hydrograph
    than climate change, particularly during the dry season; climate change increases
    the uncertainty of reservoir operation impacts.
  8: The direction and magnitude of changes in river discharge due to climate change
    vary significantly depending on the GCM, emission scenario, and location within
    the Mekong River basin. Reservoir operations increase dry season discharge and
    decrease wet season discharge.
  11: Climate change and reservoir operations impact Mekong River discharge, affecting
    flood volume and peak discharge. Reservoirs reduce flood peaks but also decrease
    overall flood volume.
  15: Reservoir operations have a larger impact on flood pulse parameters than climate
    change, at least within the study's timeframe. Climate change increases the uncertainty
    of estimated reservoir operation impacts.
Methodology:
  1: Downscaled output of five GCMs, used an optimisation approach to simulate reservoir
    operation, and a distributed hydrological model (VMod) with 5km x 5km resolution
    for hydrological assessment.
  8: Hydrological model runs were performed for the baseline period (1982-1992) and
    a future period (2032-2042) using different GCMs, emission scenarios (A1b and
    B1), and reservoir configurations.
  11: Uses change factor downscaling to assess impacts of average climate change on
    dry and wet years. Computes monthly discharges for driest and wettest years under
    different scenarios. Employs a paired two-sided t-test to assess statistical significance
    of changes in flood parameters between scenario and baseline data (flood volume,
    peak discharge, and peak discharge timing at Kratie). The time period for model
    runs under emissions scenarios is 2032-2042, and the baseline period is 1982-1992.
  15: Study uses models to assess the impacts of climate change and reservoir operations
    on river hydrology in the Mekong River Basin. The study timeframe is unspecified,
    but it assesses future changes.
More Notes:
  1: "The study assesses the cumulative impact of climate change and reservoir operation\
    \ on the hydrology of the Mekong within the next 20\u201330 years."
  8: The paper focuses on hydrological changes (temperature, precipitation, runoff,
    and river discharge) in the Mekong River basin under different climate change
    scenarios and reservoir operations. While it identifies climate change as a risk
    driver, it doesn't directly quantify macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, or the
    costs/benefits of adaptation at a national level.
  11: The study focuses on hydrological impacts in the Mekong River basin, with Chiang
    Saen and Kratie as specific locations of interest.
  15: The impact of reservoir operations is dependent on the operation rules and location
    of dams. Collaboration with dam planners is needed.

    2042 ranges from \u221211% to +15% (wet season) and \u221210% to +13% (dry season)\
