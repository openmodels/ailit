Drivers of Risk:
  2: Anthropogenic climate change is altering precipitation patterns and increasing
    temperatures, resulting in more frequent extreme vegetation-fire events.
  3: Reduced solar radiation, air pollution/increased aerosols, black carbon deposition,
    topography, localized rainfall, post-fire debris flow, permafrost thaw/loss, pyric
    herbivory, indigenous burning, nitrogen deposition, phosphorus deposition, sediment
    deposition, extreme fire-weather conditions, drought, fuel dryness, land-cover
    conversion, interannual drought cycles and the absence of extreme vegetation-fire
    events.
  4: Warmer, drier summers and earlier spring snowmelt have increased the area burned
    from vegetation fires.
  6: "Climate change (increasing temperatures, drought, lightning activity), vegetation\
    \ changes (agriculture, invasive species, monocultures), deforestation, interannual\
    \ variation in drought cycles (e.g., El Ni\xF1o\u2013Southern Oscillation), anthropogenic\
    \ factors (human settlement patterns, land use)."
  7: Increases in fire weather and burned area projected in regions such as North
    America and Mediterranean Europe due to climate change.
  8: Fossil-fuel emissions, urban heat islands, altered surface albedo leading to
    increased atmospheric CO2 and other GHG emissions, drought stress, and more extreme
    fire weather.
  9: Climate change (leading to worsening fire weather), vegetation changes (e.g.,
    shifts in flammability), anthropogenic factors (e.g., logging, deforestation,
    ignitions), drought, elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and extreme fire
    events.
  10: Direct flame, Radiant heat, Convective heat, Ember cast, Smoke
  11: Climate change shrinking safe weather windows for prescribed burning; ineffective
    fuel treatments; poor planning, design, and regulation in the WUI.
  12: Changing climate and land-use patterns increase flammability.
  13: Anthropogenic fire regimes are influenced by human activity and climate change.
Evaluation overview:
  2: Economically disastrous fires affect life, property, and human health.
  3: This page does not explicitly provide an overview of the outcome being evaluated,
    but it touches on environmental impacts of fire like canopy damage and broader
    impacts on the biosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and atmosphere.
  4: No relevant information
  6: Fire activity (frequency, severity, season length, burned area, and fire occurrence).
  7: Fire activity changes in global, biome, and regional contexts.
  8: No relevant information
  9: The page discusses future fire activity and its impacts on vegetation, carbon
    storage, and emissions.
  10: No relevant information
  11: Discusses human health impacts (death, hospitalization) from biomass smoke pollution
    from both wildfires and prescribed fires.
  12: The flammability of many landscapes is increasing because of the combined effects
    of changing climate and land-use patterns.
  13: Human health impacts and economic losses from fire disasters are outcomes being
    evaluated.
Highlights:
  2: Human settlement and infrastructure embedded in flammable vegetation contributes
    to economically disastrous fires.
  3: Global fire activity is changing, with regional-scale variation, climate change,
    and anthropogenic drivers playing important roles. Fire-weather season length
    has increased significantly. Global area burned has declined, but regional patterns
    vary greatly, and other metrics besides burned area are important, such as fire
    intensity and fire severity.
  4: Fire activity and regimes are controlled by the interaction of biomass and climate,
    as well as human and natural ignitions.  Fire regimes in the western USA were
    anthropogenically driven in the 19th century. In Canada, increased fire frequency
    and extent are related to higher regional temperatures, longer fire seasons, and
    drier fuels, with most burned area caused by lightning. Increased fire leads to
    increased greenhouse gas emissions.
  6: Frequency or severity of fire weather, fire-season length, burned area and fire
    occurrence are increasing globally with future climate change. Some regions may
    have no change or decreases, particularly those with substantial human influence,
    but no papers support a widespread decrease in fire risk. There will be a large
    increase in the occurrence of extreme fire weather for much of the globe, particularly
    in the semi-arid, the Mediterranean and the Amazon.
  7: Projected increases in fire weather and burned area in many regions including
    global and North America contexts, with mixed changes in some areas.
  8: Linkages and feedbacks between the global climate system, wildfire, and vegetation
    could drive future fire activity in the Anthropocene. Climate change effects could
    substantially overwrite human influences on fire regimes.
  9: Climate change, vegetation, and fire interactions can drive runaway feedback
    processes leading to landscape transformation. Ecosystems at the fringe of bioclimatic
    niches or in climate/fire refugia are particularly vulnerable. Landscape-wide
    conversions from forests to grasslands/shrublands are possible, depleting soil
    carbon stores. Extreme fire events pose a significant challenge for prediction.
  10: Sustainable fire management demands careful fuel management to conserve biodiversity,
    sustain ecosystem services and reduce the risk of wildfire disasters.
  11: Prescribed burning can have significant constraints and biomass smoke pollution
    can exceed the human-health impact of the wildfires it is intended to mitigate.
    Government regulation of smoke pollution from both wildfire and prescribed fires
    could drive innovation in fuels management.
  12: Managed fire regimes can potentially mitigate non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions
    and reduce the risk of destructive fires, but require careful monitoring to avoid
    unwanted ecological side effects.
  13: Coordinated transdisciplinary research can lead to the development of fire-management
    strategies and avoid adverse economic and environmental impacts of fire disasters.
    There is a considerable need for data collection to improve quantification and
    modeling of fire activity and human populations.
Methodology:
  3: The analysis uses satellite observations and burned area records (MODIS). Early
    satellite observations are spatially coarse and have imperfect coverage with reliable
    coverage only available since the turn of this century. There is substantial variation
    in fire activity amongst biomes, which demands regional rather than global analyses.
  4: Provides context for figures showing global patterns of fire, vegetation, mean
    annual burned fraction (2001-2018 from MODIS), and 95th percentile of Fire Weather
    Index (FWI) derived from ERA5, tree cover from MODIS, and broad spatial pattern
    of five types of fire regime.
  6: Review of papers published since the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, augmented
    with additional key papers. Approaches used to model future changes include process-based
    coupled Earth System Models and statistical approaches (environmental-niche modelling).
  7: "Projections based on changes in fire indicators related to global mean temperatures\
    \ 2\xB0C above pre-industrial levels compared to 1981-2010 baseline."
  8: The page discusses process-based mechanistic modelling that incorporates the
    complex interplay of climate, CO2, vegetation, and fire, and sometimes, impacts
    of land-use change and change in ignitions. It also references statistical association
    between current and projected climate variables and area burned.
  9: The page discusses regional-scale models for fire activity and the challenges
    of coupling interdisciplinary models. It references the difficulty of predicting
    extreme fire events due to the complex interactions and uncertainties in Earth-system
    models.
  10: "Adaptation and management approaches tailored to specific environmental and\
    \ socio-ecological settings in flammable landscapes and the wildland\u2013urban\
    \ interface."
  11: The paper reviews existing literature and provides insights based on synthesized
    knowledge.
  12: Managed fire regimes are being evaluated for their impact on non-CO2 greenhouse
    gas emissions, carbon storage, and biodiversity, with careful monitoring and evaluation
    required.
  13: Economic models are used to inform investment in sustainable fire management.
    Anthropological research into 'fire cultures' can improve our understanding of
    human relationships with fire use. Risk and disaster sciences are used to explore
    linkages between fire and post-fire geophysical disasters.
More Notes:
  2: Fire activity is driven by the interplay between climate, weather, vegetation
    type, ignition and anthropogenic fire management.
  3: The paper highlights the need to consider metrics beyond burned area, such as
    fire intensity and severity. It also points out the observational limitations
    and the importance of regional-scale analyses due to substantial variation amongst
    biomes.
  4: The paper emphasizes that area burned alone does not adequately capture the changing
    risk of fire events.
  8: The paper notes uncertainty in projections due to feedbacks in the Earth system
    and difficulties in modeling human behavior. It also highlights the complexity
    of fire in the Earth system and its sensitivity to climate change, underscoring
    the challenge in predicting future fire regimes.
  9: The page emphasizes the uncertainty in fire-regime predictions due to the complexity
    of the system. It also highlights the importance of adaptation and effective management
    to promote environmental sustainability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in
    the Anthropocene.
  10: Intensity of fire management changes proportionally with human population and
    economic assets.
  11: Emphasizes the need for integrating indigenous and local knowledge into fire
    management, addressing WUI expansion, and using technology for disseminating information
    on fire and smoke hazards.
  12: The paper emphasizes the need for transdisciplinary research combining natural
    and social sciences, engineering, technology, and humanities to develop effective
    fire management interventions.
  13: The capacity of the global fire-science community is being increasingly stretched
    by the surge of anomalous fire events.
Quantitative material:
  2: Global mean carbon emissions due to fire were approximately 2.2 Pg per year from
    1997 to 2016, about 22% of contemporary global annual carbon emissions from fossil
    fuel combustion.
  3: From 1979 to 2013, an average increase of 18.7% in fire-weather-season length
    has been documented across global burnable lands. Between 1998 and 2015, the area
    burned by vegetation fires globally declined by around 25%, from over 500 Mha
    to less than 400 Mha annually.
  6: "Increase of almost 130% for the Mediterranean and just under 40% for Alaska\
    \ in the number of days exceeding the 95th percentile of the Fire Weather Index\
    \ when global mean temperatures reach 2 \xB0C above pre-industrial levels. Some\
    \ models showing a 58% increase in global burned area by the end of the twenty-first\
    \ century under stronger warming scenarios."
  7: Various regional percent changes in fire indicators, such as +23.5% burned area
    in Europe-Mediterranean and +10.2% burned area in North America-Western USA.
  8: "In Mediterranean Europe, projections suggest a 40\u2013100% increase in burned\
    \ area with a 1.5 \xB0C to 3 \xB0C warming."
  9: The page alludes to modeling results but does not explicitly state specific quantitative
    outcomes, it shows conceptual graphs relating vegetation type to carbon sequestration
    and emission rates.
  10: Distance of exposure to conductive heat/direct flames (<0.01 m), radiant heat
    (<30 m), convective heat (30+ m), embers/brands (30+ m), and smoke, particulates
    and aerosols (30+ m)
  11: Smoke from the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires is thought to have caused 417
    deaths and several thousand hospitalizations.
  12: Application of managed fire to 28,000 km2 of Eucalyptus savannah in Arnhem Land
    is estimated to have reduced accountable non-CO2 emissions by 37.7% relative to
    emissions in the decade prior to the intervention.
