Drivers of Risk:
  5: Changes in burned area due to vegetation fires, changes in fire weather index
  13: Anthropogenic fire regimes influenced by human activity and the effects of mismanaged
    fire and the resulting disasters.
Highlights:
  5: Shows increasing trends in burned area and fire emissions in several regions
    (Africa, Western USA, Canada, New South Wales, Tasmania, Central Chile, Portugal,
    Indonesia, and Brazilian Amazonia), alongside increasing fire weather index trends
    in some locations.
  13: A global database on economic costs and losses from fire disasters is needed;
    currently, data is available only for a few regions such as the USA and Canada.
Methodology:
  5: Analysis of historical fire data, including burned area from various sources
    (historical reconstruction, Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) data, MODIS),
    and fire emissions data. Data were bias corrected using periods of overlap to
    the reference MTBS record.
  13: The page discusses the need for economic models to inform investment and suggests
    a global database akin to the Global Fire Atlas is needed for understanding the
    economic costs of wildfire management and disasters.
More Notes:
  5: The page primarily presents trends in vegetation fire activity (burned area and
    fire emissions) and related variables, but it does not directly link these trends
    to specific macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, except for a brief mention
    of US federal fire-suppression costs. The information could be used as input for
    other analyses that estimate the economic impact of fires.
No relevant information:
  4: This page primarily discusses fire ecology, drivers of fire activity, and regional
    trends in fire. It does not contain direct information on macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes related to climate change or adaptation costs and benefits at a national
    level. While it mentions increased firefighting costs, it doesn't quantify the
    overall economic or fiscal impact.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  5: US federal fire-suppression costs
  13: Understanding the full costs of fire disasters, including human health impacts,
    is essential for informing investment in sustainable fire management and economic
    valuations.
Quantitative material:
  5: Includes graphs of burned area (km^2), fire emissions (TgC per year), fire suppression
    costs (billion US$), and fire weather index trends across different countries/regions
    over time.
