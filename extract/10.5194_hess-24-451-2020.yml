Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global warming leading to changes in drought severity and duration
  2: Rising temperatures leading to more intense and frequent dry spells exacerbate
    drought conditions.
  3: Changes in global drought conditions
  4: "Projected global mean temperatures reaching 1.5 and 2.0\xB0C warming; surface\
    \ downwelling and upwelling shortwave \uFB02ux; surface downwelling and upwelling\
    \ longwave \uFB02ux"
  5: Changes in drought duration and severity
  6: Rising temperatures leading to higher evaporative demands and more frequent/persistent
    dry spells.
  7: "Droughts, increasing drought severity and duration, global temperature increases\
    \ (1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming)"
  8: Warming levels and their impact on drought severity and frequency are the primary
    drivers of risk.
  9: "Increasing drought risks (more frequent historical 50-year events); 1.5\xB0\
    C and 2.0\xB0C warmer worlds"
  10: "The primary driver of risk is climate warming, specifically comparing 1.5\xB0\
    C and 2.0\xB0C warming targets above preindustrial levels."
  11: "Climate warming, specifically 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming scenarios, is the\
    \ main driver of increased drought risks."
  12: Warming-induced hydrological changes, simultaneous increase in precipitation
    and evaporative demand, decreasing SPEI-3
  13: "Changes in joint 50-year return periods of droughts between the 1.5 and 2.0\xB0\
    C warming targets, impacts of CO2 concentrations on stomatal resistance (rs),\
    \ potential evapotranspiration, total leaf area, growing-season length"
  15: Changes in drought risks, specifically focusing on the Standardized Precipitation
    Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) as an indicator of drought.
  16: "Increasing drought risks under different warming levels (1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0\
    C)."
  17: "Changes in drought conditions (SPEI-3), global warming levels (1.5\xB0C and\
    \ 2.0\xB0C), and climate model uncertainties (GCMs) and RCP scenarios."
  18: Changes in global drought characteristics identified using the SPEI combined
    with the run theory, changes in occurrence measured by both drought duration and
    severity.

  18: "Global drought bivariate magnitudes and socioeconomic consequences in the 1.5\
    \ and 2.0\u25E6C warmer worlds"
  19: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: "Limiting global warming to 1.5\u25E6C, compared with 2\u25E6C warming, can perceptibly\
    \ mitigate the drought impacts over major regions of the world."
  2: Current socioeconomic assessments often use static scenarios, failing to capture
    dynamic population and asset changes. Previous studies tend to investigate drought
    variables separately, potentially underestimating drought risks. The paper criticizes
    the 'equivalent frequency combination' (EFC) method used in infrastructure design
    due to its questionable statistical basis.
  3: "Quantifies changes in global drought conditions and socioeconomic exposure with\
    \ additional levels of 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warming."
  4: "Projects future temperature changes under varying emissions pathways and emphasizes\
    \ the uncertainty range for each projection. Shows projected global mean temperatures\
    \ when reaching 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warming under different RCP scenarios."
  5: No relevant information
  6: The mean SPEI-3 decreases globally, indicating increased dryness. Drought duration
    and severity are projected to increase in many regions, with some areas experiencing
    compound increases. Socioeconomic exposure to drought risk is evaluated based
    on population and GDP in affected areas.
  7: "The world will experience more severe drought conditions with additional warming\
    \ from 1.5 to 2.0\xB0C. Drought severity increases more rapidly than drought duration\
    \ globally. Extreme drought conditions are projected to occur more frequently\
    \ under warming climates. Certain regions (Mediterranean, South Africa, South\
    \ America) are more severely drought-prone."
  8: "At 2.0\xB0C warming, 71% of continental areas will see increased frequency of\
    \ historical 50-year droughts; droughts could become 2 to 10 times more frequent\
    \ in specific regions."
  9: Large percentages of population and GDP will be exposed to increasing drought
    risks globally under different SSPs. The most drought-affected countries are presented
    by high fractions of drought-affected population or GDP.
  10: "Limiting warming to 1.5\xB0C instead of 2\xB0C has significant benefits, particularly\
    \ for mitigating population and GDP exposure to drought. Some regions, like Canada,\
    \ may experience slightly decreased drought exposure at 2\xB0C compared to 1.5\xB0\
    C due to decreased land fraction exposure to more frequent droughts."
  11: Drought risks and socioeconomic exposures are projected to increase significantly
    in hotspot countries, with more profound increases in tropical regions (e.g.,
    Mexico and Brazil) compared to high-latitude countries (e.g., Canada).
  12: "Limiting warming to 1.5\u25E6C would substantially mitigate future drought\
    \ risks and corresponding socioeconomic exposures; Climate warming is expected\
    \ to lead to a general intensification of drought conditions, as the drying of\
    \ the surface is enhanced with water scarcity."
  13: Increasing rs causes a decline in potential evapotranspiration, especially across
    vegetated lands. Neglecting increasing rs may overestimate future drying conditions
    and drought risk changes. The increase in total leaf area with CO2 and growing-season
    length can cause countervailing decreases in rs. Changing the drought threshold
    influences drought characteristics.
  15: Aggravated drought risks are projected globally, with more significant increases
    over mid-latitudes and tropical regions. Regions like the Mediterranean, southern
    Africa, and southern North America are highlighted as areas with large projected
    changes. High model agreement in drought-prone areas implies high confidence in
    these projections. Tropical and mid-latitude regions, where most of the global
    population lives, are projected to bear the greatest drought risks. 100% of the
    population in tropical regions like Brazil and Mexico would be affected by increasing
    drought risks.
  16: "Drought risks and population (GDP) both contribute to the exposure change;\
    \ dynamic socioeconomic impacts are important and often ignored in other studies.\
    \ A large percentage of global land is exposed to increasing drought risk under\
    \ 1.5\xB0C warming."
  17: "Increasing drought risks lead to increasing exposures of population and GDP.\
    \ Differences in the magnitudes of drought risk changes can bring about divergent\
    \ impacts to the local population and economy. Controlling global warming at the\
    \ 1.5\xB0C level is beneficial. Model uncertainty is relatively large, particularly\
    \ for South America and Africa."
  18: "The means of SPEI-3 from the historical period to the 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warmer\
    \ worlds are projected to descend at a global scale, while the standard deviation\
    \ exhibits large increases. Compared to the 1.5\u25E6C warming condition, there\
    \ will be a further increase in drought severity and a persistent lengthening\
    \ in drought duration under the additional 2.0\u25E6C warming level."
  19: "75 countries with 100% population exposure to drought risk at 1.5\xB0C warming;\
    \ additional 17 countries at risk with 2.0\xB0C; tropical countries like Mexico\
    \ and Brazil see major increases in drought risk"
Methodology:
  1: Uses the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) combined
    with the run theory, with climate scenarios projected by 13 Coupled Model Inter-comparison
    Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models (GCMs) under three representative
    concentration pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Copula functions and the
    most likely realization are incorporated to model the joint distribution of drought
    severity and duration, and changes in the bivariate return period with global
    warming are evaluated. Drought exposures of populations and regional gross domestic
    product (GDP) under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) are investigated
    globally.
  2: The paper discusses the limitations of univariate frequency analysis in drought
    assessments and advocates for a multivariate approach using copula functions to
    model the interdependence of drought characteristics (severity and duration).
    It also discusses the challenges of variable selection in a multivariate framework
    and introduces the concept of 'most likely design realization.'
  3: Drought characteristics are identified using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration
    Index (SPEI) combined with the run theory and with climate scenarios simulated
    by 13 CMIP5 global climate models (GCMs) under three RCPs (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and
    RCP8.5).
  4: "Uses 13 GCMs (listed in Table 1) to project temperature changes. PET is calculated\
    \ using the Penman\u2013Monteith approach."
  5: Uses SPEI-3, run theory, copula functions (Gumbel), and most likely realization
    method to identify drought events and estimate joint return periods of drought
    duration and severity. Calculates socioeconomic exposure by evaluating changes
    in drought occurrence frequency in a bivariate context.
  6: "The study uses the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI-3)\
    \ to assess dryness and drought characteristics. It recalculates joint occurrence\
    \ frequencies of drought events under 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming, relative\
    \ to a historical period (1976-2005). Socioeconomic exposure is assessed by recording\
    \ population and GDP in areas with more severe drought. Analysis is performed\
    \ on six scenarios using three RCPs and corresponding SSPs."
  7: "Analysis based on changes in SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration\
    \ Index) under different warming scenarios (1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C); Violin plots\
    \ are used to display the probability distribution of drought characteristics\
    \ across land pixels. Includes multi-model ensemble mean results, using drought\
    \ frequency based on SPEI-3."
  8: Uses a copula-based approach to project changes under different warming levels
    to assess changes in drought risks.
  9: Combines drought projection with population and GDP information based on SSPs;
    nation-wide population (and GDP) fraction is employed as the indicator.
  10: "The analysis projects socioeconomic exposures under three SSPs and examines\
    \ the differences between 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming levels. It assesses changes\
    \ in drought duration and severity using climate models and analyzes the resulting\
    \ impacts on population and GDP exposure."
  11: Spatially aggregating mean changes in drought return period relative to the
    historical 50-year drought for land fractions binned into 20 groups is used for
    assessment at the national scale. The eight example countries are Argentina, Australia,
    Canada, China, United States, South Africa, Brazil, and Mexico.
  12: "Climate model projections under SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585 scenarios, using\
    \ the reference crop Penman\u2013Monteith model to calculate potential evapotranspiration\
    \ (and thus SPEI)"
  13: Uses run theory with drought threshold values (e.g., -0.5) to identify drought
    events of varying severity and duration. Employs bivariate frequency analysis.
    Traditional fixed rs method is used to calculate potential evapotranspiration.
  15: 'Drought risks are analyzed using the SPEI, with different thresholds (-0.5
    and -0.8) to define drought categories. The analysis considers 20-, 50-, and 100-year
    drought events. Socioeconomic exposures are calculated based on variations of
    drought risks and dynamic population/GDP pathways. The histograms compare the
    change in Return Period (RP) of a 50-year event under three different scenarios:
    SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585.'
  16: "Considers differences in population and GDP between the fixed 30-year 1.5 and\
    \ 2.0\xB0C warming periods to define exposure. Bivariate drought risks are examined."
  17: "Uses multi-model ensembles to quantify changes in SPEI-3 under three RCPs.\
    \ Considers the bivariate return period of the present 50-year drought condition\
    \ for each model under RCP4.5 in a 1.5\xB0C warming world and the occurrence change\
    \ under an additional 0.5\xB0C warming."
  18: Climate projected by the multi-model ensemble under three representative concentration
    pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). The drought characteristics are identified
    using the SPEI combined with the run theory, and the changes in occurrence are
    measured by both drought duration and severity, with the incorporation of the
    copula functions and most likely realization method.

More Notes:
  3: Employs spatially explicit global shared SSPs (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways)
    for population and GDP data.
  4: Table 1 lists the models used, their resolution, and institution. The study uses
    RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios.
  5: The paper uses the 'OR' case (Tor) for drought occurrence assessment, which represents
    the expected inter-arrival time of drought events considering both duration and
    severity. The most likely realization method is used to select the drought scenario
    with the highest likelihood along the Tor-level isoline.
  7: Analysis uses RCP scenarios, as shown in the images (2.6, 4.5, 8.5).
  8: No additional notes relevant to U.S. National Climate Assessment impact review.
  9: The analysis focuses on the *fraction* of a country's population/GDP affected
    by drought rather than absolute numbers, to give a fairer assessment, particularly
    for countries with small populations or GDPs.
  11: Oceanic forcing that favors deep convection over the ocean and weakens continental
    convergence associated with the monsoon is suggested as a factor contributing
    to increased drought risks in tropical countries.
  12: The study confirms decreasing SPEI-3 and significantly increasing drought severity
    and duration with warming globally.
  13: The impact of rs on drought assessments is acknowledged as needing further study
    but is beyond the scope of this study.
  15: Model uncertainty is higher in regions with small changing amplitudes (e.g.,
    Southeast Asia and Russia).
  16: The analysis focuses on exposure, defined as the number of people/GDP in areas
    where drought risks increase under warming. The paper highlights limitations of
    using single-year population/GDP data.
  17: Emphasizes the importance of incorporating dynamic population and GDP into exposure-calculating
    processes.
