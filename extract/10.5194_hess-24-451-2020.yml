  13: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Projected increases in magnitude and socioeconomic exposure of global droughts\
    \ at 1.5 and 2\xB0C warmer climates."
  3: "Changes in global drought conditions and socioeconomic exposure with additional\
    \ levels of 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warming; Climate scenarios simulated by 13 CMIP5\
    \ global climate models (GCMs) under three RCPs (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5)."
  6: "Projected increases in drought severity and duration due to a 0.5\xB0C warming\
    \ difference from 1.5\xB0C to 2.0\xB0C scenarios, leading to more frequent and\
    \ severe droughts, affecting global regions differently."
  7: "Global temperature increases (1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming scenarios) and different\
    \ Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios impacting drought frequency,\
    \ duration, and severity."
  9: "Increasing drought risks, defined as more frequent historical 50-year events,\
    \ driven by climate change (1.5\xB0C warming target)."
  10: "Climate warming, specifically the difference between 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C\
    \ warming scenarios, and different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)."
  12: "Warming-induced hydrological changes, including increases in precipitation\
    \ and evaporative demand governed by the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relationship,\
    \ lead to intensification of drought conditions."
  13: "Projected changes in drought characteristics (frequency, duration, and severity)\
    \ due to climate change (specifically, the difference between 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0\
    C warming targets), influenced by different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)."
  15: "Projected increases in drought risks due to climate change (specifically warming\
    \ targets of 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C), El Ni\xF1o frequency, Hadley cell extension,\
    \ and poleward moisture transport."
  16: Drought risks and population (GDP) changes due to climate change.
  17: Increasing drought risks due to climate change and increasing population and
    GDP in affected areas.
  18: "Increased drought duration and severity due to climate change, specifically\
    \ at 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming levels under different RCP scenarios (RCP2.6,\
    \ RCP4.5, and RCP8.5)"
  19: "Increased drought frequency and severity due to global warming (1.5\xB0C and\
    \ 2.0\xB0C scenarios)."
Highlights:
  1: "Limiting global warming to 1.5\xB0C can mitigate drought impacts over major\
    \ regions compared to 2\xB0C warming; more than 75 countries' populations and\
    \ GDP are affected at 1.5\xB0C warming, with 17 more countries at 2\xB0C."
  3: "Quantifies changes in global drought conditions and socioeconomic exposure with\
    \ additional levels of 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warming."
  6: Drought severity is projected to significantly increase globally under warming
    scenarios, with specific regions experiencing both increased severity and duration,
    stressing the need for enhanced societal and environmental resilience.
  7: "Increasing drought severity and duration projected under 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0\
    C warming, particularly in Mediterranean regions, South Africa, and South America,\
    \ posing challenges for socio-hydrological systems."
  9: Large percentages of population and GDP will be exposed to increasing drought
    risks globally. The most drought-affected countries are identified by high fractions
    of drought-affected population and GDP relative to their total.
  10: "Holding global warming to 1.5\xB0C instead of 2\xB0C provides benefits, particularly\
    \ for mitigating population and GDP exposure to drought. Drought exposures for\
    \ some countries can be slightly decreased in the 2\xB0C warming level compared\
    \ to the 1.5\xB0C warming level, demonstrating spatial heterogeneity in drought\
    \ exposure variations."
  12: "Ambitiously limiting warming to 1.5\xB0C would substantially mitigate future\
    \ drought risks and associated socioeconomic exposures."
  13: "The projected changes in joint 50-year return periods of droughts are compared\
    \ between 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming targets under different SSP scenarios.\
    \ The analysis explores the sensitivity of drought assessments to the choice of\
    \ threshold value for identifying drought events."
  15: Aggravated drought risks are projected globally, with more significant increases
    in mid-latitudes and tropical regions.  Tropical and mid-latitude regions, where
    the vast majority of the global population resides, would bear the greatest drought
    risks. Significant spatial variability in drought risk changes.
  16: Dynamic socioeconomic exposure considers population and GDP changes, unlike
    previous studies using single-year values.
  17: "Controlling global warming at the 1.5\xB0C level is beneficial due to the significant\
    \ increase in exposed population and GDP at 2.0\xB0C warming. Dynamic population\
    \ and GDP should be incorporated into exposure calculations. Model uncertainty\
    \ is large, particularly in South America and Africa."
  18: "Drought duration is projected to slowly prolong across 78% of the land surface,\
    \ while drought severity shows a much more pronounced rise globally in the 1.5\xB0\
    C warming world. Some regions in mid-latitude regions and the tropics would experience\
    \ substantial increases in drought magnitude. There are regional differences (e.g.,\
    \ Colombia) in GDP exposure depending on the SSP scenario at different warming\
    \ levels."
  19: "A large number of countries will face 100% GDP exposure to increasing drought\
    \ risks under both 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming scenarios."
Methodology:
  1: Uses Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), 13 CMIP5 global
    climate models under different RCPs, copula functions to model drought severity
    and duration, and evaluates socioeconomic exposures of populations and GDP under
    SSPs.
  3: Uses the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) combined
    with run theory and climate scenarios. Copula functions model drought severity
    and duration concurrently; Bivariate return periods are assessed for changes in
    drought exposure.
  6: "The analysis uses historical 50-year bivariate quantiles to estimate changes\
    \ in drought recurrence under 1.5 and 2.0\xB0C warming scenarios, evaluating socioeconomic\
    \ impacts by recording population and GDP in affected areas across different SSPs\
    \ and RCPs."
  7: Uses the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and multi-model
    ensemble mean results to project changes in drought characteristics under different
    warming scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5); analysis applicable to assessing drought
    risks under future climate change.
  9: Drought projection combined with population and GDP information based on SSPs
    to estimate exposures. Fraction of drought-affected population (and GDP) divided
    by the total national population (or total GDP) is used as the indicator.
  10: "The analysis calculates socioeconomic exposures under three SSPs and the differences\
    \ in percentage between the 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warming levels. It examines projected\
    \ changes in drought duration and severity between the 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warming\
    \ targets."
  12: "Potential evapotranspiration calculated using the Penman\u2013Monteith model;\
    \ scenarios analyzed through different SSPs (126, 245, 585)."
  13: The analysis uses a 'run theory' approach to identify drought events based on
    a threshold value of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). Bivariate frequency
    analysis is used. The impact of stomatal resistance (rs) scaling with CO2 is discussed,
    but a traditional fixed rs method is ultimately used. A threshold of -0.5 is used,
    and the robustness is tested with a threshold of -0.8. The results are applicable
    to understanding drought risk under different warming levels and SSP scenarios.
  15: The study analyzes changes in drought risks using the SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration
    Index), considering different drought categories (Near normal, Mild, Moderate,
    Extreme) based on SPEI values. Dynamic population and GDP pathways are used to
    estimate socioeconomic exposure to drought risks.
  16: "The study considers differences in population and GDP between the fixed 30-year\
    \ 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warming periods."
  17: The analysis uses multi-model ensembles under three RCPs to quantify changes
    in SPEI-3 (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index).
  18: "The study uses the SPEI drought index combined with run theory and copula functions\
    \ to quantify drought changes. It analyzes climate projections from CMIP5 models\
    \ under different RCP scenarios. Socioeconomic exposure is assessed using population\
    \ and GDP data at a 0.5\xB0 x 0.5\xB0 resolution, upscaled to the resolution of\
    \ GCM outputs (primarily 1 degree, with a sensitivity test at 2 degrees). The\
    \ study uses multi-model ensemble mean to serve as the warming trajectory."

More Notes:
  3: Different RCP-SSP combinations are considered. The study employs spatially explicit
    global shared SSPs instead of static socioeconomic scenarios.
  7: The paper focuses on hydrological impacts of climate change (droughts) and exposure,
    but does not directly link these impacts to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
    Potential implications for national economies could be inferred from the severity
    and duration of droughts on agriculture, water resources, and other sectors.
  9: Economic prosperity is associated with higher population and immigration, causing
    drought-affected GDP exposures to exhibit similar changing patterns to population
    exposure. Drought resilience is noted as an important factor determining the ultimate
    impact of droughts.
  13: The page focuses on the hydrological aspects of drought risk assessment and
    does not directly link to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. The impact of stomatal
    resistance (rs) on drought assessments is acknowledged as a potential area for
    future research, indicating a source of uncertainty in the current analysis.
  15: "The study notes high model agreement in some drought-prone areas, implying\
    \ high confidence in the projections for those regions. Conversely, there's substantial\
    \ model uncertainty in regions with small changing amplitudes, such as Southeast\
    \ Asia and Russia. The findings are related to previous studies on El Ni\xF1o\
    \ frequency, Hadley cell extension, and poleward moisture transport."
  18: The study acknowledges uncertainties related to GCM structure, RCPs, internal
    climate variability, and drought indices. The authors note that the 1-degree resolution
    of their study is appropriate for capturing regional population and GDP exposures
    and that a sensitivity analysis using a 2-degree resolution yielded similar results.
    The SPEI-3 is projected to shift towards the negative side with a flatter tendency,
    implying a more severe drying condition in a future warming world.
