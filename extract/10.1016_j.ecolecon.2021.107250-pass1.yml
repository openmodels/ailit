Drivers of Risk:
  2: Rising temperatures, low agricultural potential.
  3: Temperature, agricultural potential, low socio-economic development, low capabilities
    of the state, intergroup inequality, a recent history of violence, natural resource
    degradation, climate events.
  4: Temperature variations
  11: Temperature, Interaction (presumably temperature interacted with some other
    variable).
  12: Average temperature (country level) and agricultural potential (share of land
    with suitability index > 40).
  13: Temperature
  15: Temperature variations and their interactions are analyzed as potential drivers
    of risk.
  16: Average temperature and agricultural potential (share of land with SI>40).
Highlights:
  2: Initial agricultural conditions play a significant role in understanding climate-conflict
    linkages on a global scale; interaction has no significant effect in countries
    with exportable resources such as oil; long-term relationship points to a mitigation
    of the negative impact of the interaction on civil conflicts.
  3: The study aims at establishing the causal link between temperature and conflicts
    through the magnifying effects of agricultural potential.
  4: Countries with low agricultural potential have a larger probability than high
    agricultural potential countries to be in conflict in response to a deviation
    from their mean annual temperature.
  11: The coefficient on temperature and its interaction are shown for different specifications.
  12: Higher average temperatures and specific levels of agricultural potential are
    associated with higher predicted conflict incidence.
  13: Temperature positively impacts the unnamed macroeconomic outcome. This impact
    is significantly moderated by interactions with agricultural/non-agricultural,
    OECD/non-OECD and OPEC/non-OPEC status.
  16: Higher predicted conflict incidences are more prominent at certain intersections
    of agricultural potential and average temperature, especially around temperatures
    of 6 to 18 degrees Celsius and agricultural potential of 1 to 10.
Methodology:
  2: Natural experiment using data for 172 countries from 1946 until 2014; analyzes
    the interaction between time-wise variations in temperature within a country and
    the cross-country variation in agricultural potential on conflict incidence. Analysis
    of long-term relationship (decennial averages).
  3: Linear probability model examining the effect of the interaction between temperature
    and agricultural potential on conflict incidence. Includes country and year fixed
    effects to control for unobserved variables. Natural experiment approach.
  4: The paper uses an interaction term between temperature variation and agricultural
    potential to identify the causal effect of the interaction on the incidence of
    conflict. It focuses on intrastate conflicts with a clearly defined political
    incompatibility, using a binary variable to describe conflict incidence. Agricultural
    potential is defined based on cereals potential yields from a rain regime and
    a low level of inputs.
  11: Linear probability model with country fixed effects, time fixed effects, and
    robust standard errors clustered at the country level.
  12: Contour plot visualization of predicted conflict incidence based on average
    temperature and agricultural potential between 1946-2014.
  13: Panel regression with country and year fixed effects, using robust standard
    errors clustered at the country level. Results are applicable to the period and
    countries included in the dataset (N=5532 or N=9344). Interactions considered
    are with agricultural/non-agricultural, OECD/non-OECD and OPEC/non-OPEC.
  15: The analysis uses a linear probability model with country fixed effects and
    includes variables such as temperature and interaction terms, controlling for
    standardized temperature and decade averages.
  16: Analysis based on a contour plot showing the relationship between average temperature,
    agricultural potential, and predicted conflict incidence. Applicable for the period
    1946-2014, country level.
More Notes:
  2: This paper primarily focuses on the relationship between climate change, agricultural
    potential, and civil conflict, rather than direct macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
    The indirect link is that conflict can obviously have massive economic and fiscal
    implications.
  3: The paper frames climate change as a multiplier of threats, not a primary driver
    of conflict. It aims to disentangle the effects of drivers of conflict resulting
    from historical processes from the effect of initial geographical conditions.
  4: The paper focuses on the relationship between climate variables and the incidence
    of conflict, rather than direct macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. The connection
    to macroeconomic risks of climate change is indirect, through the potential economic
    impact of conflict.
  11: The note indicates agricultural potential is captured by the country fixed effects.
    The number of observations varies (9344 or 990). Specifications include temperature
    only, temperature and interaction, standardized temperature, and decennial temperature
    averages.
  13: The specific macroeconomic outcome being analyzed is not stated, making it difficult
    to assess the relevance. The interaction terms suggest the impact of temperature
    varies depending on the characteristics of the country (e.g. agricultural vs non-agricultural).
  16: The paper uses a metric called "Agricultural Potential (Share of land with SI>40)".
    The plot suggests a non-linear relationship between temperature, agricultural
    potential, and conflict incidence.

Quantitative material:
  2: a significantly higher probability (4%) to be in conflict when annual temperature
    deviates from its mean in a country with low agricultural potential relative to
    a country with high agricultural potential.
  4: A change of one degree Celsius is associated with an increase in the probability
    of being in conflict by 4.1% relatively to better endowed countries (countries
    with low agricultural potential).
  12: Predicted conflict incidence values ranging from approximately 0.015 to 0.219,
    visualized in a contour plot against average temperature (0-30 degrees Celsius)
    and agricultural potential (0-1).
  13: A 1 degree Celcius increase in Temperature is associated with a 0.040 to 0.041
    increase in some un-named macroeconomic outcome (significant at the 5% or 10%
    level).
