Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change; Crop yield changes
  3: Country-level climate-crop yield relationships
  7: Projected changes in atmospheric CO2 and temperature.
  15: Political changes (e.g., disintegration of USSR, changes in Ethiopia) are treated
    as extraneous factors impacting crop yields.
  18: CO2 concentration and temperature.
  20: Increasing temperatures, atmospheric CO2 levels
  22: Changes in CO2 concentration and temperature (T).
  23: CO2 levels, temperature
  25: Changes in CO2 concentration and temperature
  27: Increases in atmospheric CO2 and/or temperatures. The inability to identify
    potential tipping points is mentioned.
Highlights:
  18: Marginal effects of CO2 and temperature on wheat yields exhibit diminishing
    returns, with the effect of CO2 on yields further diminishing at higher temperatures.
    The impact of CO2 on maize yields is weak.
  20: Rice yields are difficult to accurately model due to paddy growth conditions.
    CO2 fertilization effect on sorghum is less effective at higher temperatures,
    and the effect of temperature increase diminishes at higher CO2 levels.
  22: The page focuses on quantifying the impact of CO2 and temperature on crop yields,
    highlighting potentially non-linear relationships and tipping points.
  23: Yields of several crops, including wheat, soybean and sorghum, exhibit CO2 tipping
    points. Temperature tipping points may exist for wheat. However, these results
    should be interpreted with caution.
  25: Crop yields generally increase with CO2 concentration, but the effect varies
    by crop and temperature, often showing diminishing returns at higher CO2 levels.
    Optimal temperatures for yield also vary by crop.
  27: "The evidence regarding the impact of climate change on agriculture is a matter\
    \ of interpretation, dependent on which studies are chosen to support one\u2019\
    s viewpoint and how the evidence is presented. Future technological change remains\
    \ the greatest unknown factor."
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of country-level climate-crop yield relationships
  3: The paper investigates country-level climate-crop yield relationships to assess
    the impact of climate change on food security.
  7: Uses FAO crop yield data, Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) data, and
    analysis of top 20 producing countries for six crops (wheat, maize, soybean, rapeseed/canola,
    sorghum) to investigate yield responses to CO2 and temperature changes from 1961-2018.
  15: Output-based approach to calculate PPP GDP, using PWT's human capital index
    to control for education levels. Modifications made to data to account for political
    changes in specific countries. USDA production map is used to approximate crop
    production and national average temperatures.
  18: Regression analysis with controls for GDP per capita and human capital index.
    Applicable to 46 countries for wheat and 51 countries for maize.
  20: Regression analysis to model the relationship between crop yields and temperature/CO2
    levels. Interaction terms are used to capture the effect of CO2 fertilization
    at different temperatures.
  22: Marginal effects are derived from regression models (columns 3 and 6 in Tables
    4, 5 and 6). Tipping points are computed as estimates of parameter values using
    averages from the regression models.
  23: Statistical analysis of crop yield sensitivity to CO2 and temperature. Results
    are tentative due to lack of statistical significance in many parameters.
More Notes:
  1: The paper investigates the impacts of climate change on food security, potentially
    impacting macroeconomic stability through price volatility, trade disruptions,
    and social unrest.
  7: The method used to calculate temperatures may introduce artefacts because the
    countries comprising the spatially-weighted continental averages changes from
    one crop to the next and perhaps even from one year to the next.
  15: The study acknowledges limitations including the use of a rough approximation
    of crop production and national average temperatures, and the use of annual temperature
    data that do not adequately consider the actual growing seasons for various crops.
  18: The effect of CO2 and temperature on wheat yields may be overstated without
    controls for GDP per capita and the human capital index. Limited CO2 data may
    affect the results for maize.
  20: Statistical fits for soybean and rapeseed are lower than wheat and maize, suggesting
    missing variables in the models.
  22: The analysis considers interaction effects between CO2 and temperature. Statistical
    significance of parameters is noted. The presented formulas can be used to calculate
    tipping points, but the actual values are in Table 8, not included on this page.
  23: The authors recommend further research on rice-specific crop techniques and
    note that the lack of regional CO2 data likely contributes to uncertainty. The
    paper also mentions inconsistencies in some marginal effects, such as a positive
    linear term for rice CO2 fertilization and an incorrect sign for the maize marginal
    CO2 effect.
  25: The text mentions the inability to accurately determine the tipping point for
    soybean, suggesting potential limitations in understanding the full impact of
    CO2 on crop yields.
  27: The paper highlights the potential for technological advancements like weather-indexed
    insurance, GPS, drones, and new irrigation technologies to mitigate the negative
    impacts of climate change on agriculture.
