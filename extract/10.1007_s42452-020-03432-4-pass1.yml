    yields.
  22: CO2 and temperature (T) are identified as drivers of risk for crop yield, with
    effects potentially modified by the interaction between the two.
  24: "Temperature (ranging from -40 to 50\xB0C depending on crop), Atmospheric CO2\
    \ concentration (300, average (352.8 - 356.4), 450, 550 ppm)"

  28: The page provides an overview of how technological changes in agriculture, such
    as plant breeding and genetic engineering, can improve agricultural resilience
    to climate change.
Highlights:
  4: The threat of food insecurity is overstated.
  5: Climate change may be a threat to food security.
  6: 'The analysis focuses on six main cereal crops: wheat, rice, maize, rapeseed
    (canola), soybean, and sorghum.'
  7: The response of the yields of the six crops to projected changes in atmospheric
    CO2 and temperature is indicative of potential future food insecurity. Temperatures
    in Africa are on average higher than those elsewhere. The annual variation in
    temperatures exceeds the overall increase in temperatures over the period, and
    there appears to be no trend in average BEST temperatures in some cases due to
    the method of temperature calculation.
  11: Global warming from 1981 to 2002 has offset some of the yield gains from technological
    advances, rising CO2, and other non-climatic factors; Climate changes were already
    exerting a considerable drag on yield growth; If farmers adapted to the changed
    climate conditions, wheat, maize, and rice yields in temperate regions would increase
    as a result of higher temperatures, but production of maize and wheat would be
    adversely affected by higher temperatures in the tropics.
  12: The study extends previous studies by considering temperature, CO2, technological
    advances, and other adaptations in regression models to provide a clearer picture
    of future food security.
  15: No relevant information
  17: For wheat, coefficients on CO2 and temperature are positive and statistically
    significant, while those of the quadratic terms and interaction term are negative
    and statistically significant.
  19: Soybean yields show diminishing benefits from increased CO2 and temperature,
    eventually declining. Rapeseed yields are positively correlated with temperature
    increases, but the effect of increased CO2 is ambiguous. The interaction between
    CO2 and temperature is statistically significant but small for both crops.
  20: Rice yields may not be accurately measured due to issues with temperature regressor
    (surface air temperature) and country-invariant CO2 measure. CO2 fertilization
    in sorghum is less effective at higher temperatures and the effect of temperature
    decreases at higher CO2 levels.
  21: Rice yields exhibit severe diminishing returns from temperature increases, while
    sorghum yield responses vary depending on CO2 and temperature interaction.
  22: The marginal effects for CO2 and temperature on different crops are quantified,
    and the presence of statistically insignificant parameters is noted. Mentions
    the computation of tipping points.
  24: "Higher CO2 concentrations generally lead to higher peak yields for Rice, Sorghum,\
    \ Maize and Wheat; Yield generally decreases as temperature increases, though\
    \ the specific behavior varies with CO2 concentration for Sorghum; Rapeseed yield\
    \ increases slightly with temperature up to around 0\xB0C, peaking, and then declines\
    \ as the temperature rises; Higher CO2 levels tend to start at higher yields but\
    \ show a similar decline after peaking for Rapeseed; Higher CO2 concentrations\
    \ tend to shift the peak yield to higher temperatures and higher yield levels\
    \ for Wheat."
  25: Crop yield generally increases with CO2 concentration up to a point, after which
    it plateaus or declines. Optimal CO2 concentration for yield varies depending
    on temperature. The relationship between CO2 and crop yield differs by crop.
  26: The negative impacts of global warming on food security is likely overstated
    as a result of overlooking CO2 as a determinant of crop yields; CO2-fertilization
    effect is prominent and is not being properly accounted for elsewhere; increasing
    concentrations of atmospheric CO2 can improve agricultural productivity, enabling
    crops to better utilize nutrients, including water; higher levels of CO2 also
    make crops less susceptible to drought.
  27: Empirical evidence indicates that crop yields have increased steadily since
    the 1960s. Future technological change remains the greatest unknown factor.
  28: Technological advancements in agriculture, particularly in biology, are expected
    to enhance crop yield and resilience, potentially preventing famines despite climate
    change.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of country-level climate-crop yield relationships
  4: Fixed-effects panel regression model based on CO2 levels measured at Mauna Loa,
    Hawaii, and weighted-average temperatures in each country. Also incorporates PPP
    GDP, Human Capital Index (HCI), and technological changes.
  6: The study estimates the relationship between crop yields and climate variables
    to evaluate food security implications.
  7: "Uses FAO crop yield data and Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) data\
    \ series. Historical annual temperatures by crop and continent are constructed,\
    \ spatially-weighted by a continent\u2019s countries that are in the global top-twenty\
    \ producing countries of the crop in question. Temperatures are provided on a\
    \ continent basis for each crop for the period 1961-2018."
  11: Linear regressions using first differences in yield with temperature and precipitation
    as explanatory variables; Panel analyses of maize, wheat, rice and soybean for
    all countries; Meta-analysis of 1,048 observations from 66 studies
  12: Regression models considering temperature, CO2, technological advances, and
    other adaptations, using historical crop yield data from the FAO for the top twenty
    producers of each crop. Also includes spatially-weighted temperatures at country
    levels, and the interaction effects between CO2 and temperature.
  14: Uses Berkeley Earth temperature data, USDA production maps to weight temperatures,
    Mauna Loa CO2 data, and Penn World Table data. Applies production-weighted averaged
    temperatures from weather stations within regions where crops are grown in larger
    countries. CO2 is assumed to be uniformly distributed. Analysis applicable for
    1950-2017 using PWT 9.1 data.
  15: "Uses PPP GDP calculated using the output-based approach and the PWT\u2019s\
    \ human capital index (HCI) to control for education levels. The analysis modifies\
    \ data for countries with political changes (USSR, Ethiopia, Serbia, Montenegro,\
    \ Yugoslavia SFR) or those whose data is incomplete (South Sudan, Taiwan), using\
    \ different datasets for different time periods to maintain consistency. Uses\
    \ annual temperature data. The production map provided by the USDA is a rough\
    \ approximation of crop production and national average temperatures for most\
    \ countries."
  16: A fixed effects panel regression model is used to examine how crop yields have
    changed over time within and between countries. This controls for time-invariant
    regressors excluded from the model (e.g., climate zone). The model includes quadratic
    terms for temperature and CO2, as well as an interaction term, to account for
    nonlinearities.
  17: A fixed-effects model is used, utilizing within- and across-country differences
    in weather. Statistical programs written in R and Stata are used for regression
    analysis.
  19: Regression analysis is used to model the impact of CO2 and temperature on soybean
    and rapeseed yields across multiple countries. Models include linear, quadratic,
    and interaction terms for CO2 and temperature, as well as controls for GDP/capita
    and human capital. The analysis covers 45 countries for soybeans and 35 countries
    for rapeseed.
  20: Regression models are used to analyze the relationship between crop yields and
    various factors. Models appear to be linear regressions based on reference to
    a linear CO2 parameter, but quadratic temperature effects and interaction effects
    are also modeled.
  21: Regression analysis is utilized to determine the impacts of CO2 and temperature,
    with marginal effects evaluated at average levels to identify tipping points.
  22: Marginal effects are derived from regression models. Tipping points are computed
    using averages from the regression models. Statistical significance is assessed
    at the 10% level.
  25: The analysis plots yield as a function of CO2 concentration at different fixed
    temperatures. It appears to be based on empirical data or modeling, but the specific
    methodology is not described in detail. The results are applicable to specific
    temperature ranges and CO2 concentrations.
  26: Analysis based on historical, country-level crop yield data.
More Notes:
  1: Working paper from the University of Victoria Economics Department, March 2020.
    Focuses on climate change impacts on food security via climate-crop yield relationships
    at the country level.
  4: The study examines the interactive effects of CO2 and temperature on crop yields.
  5: The paper aims to address whether climate change is a threat to food security.
  11: The first study mentioned did not consider CO2-fertilization and adaptation
    measures, potentially overestimating negative impacts. Later studies did not consider
    the impact of CO2 fertilization and other factors such as technological advances
    in their statistical models.
  12: The analysis uses data from 1961-2013, the latest year with complete FAO data.
  14: Mentions limitations of assuming uniform CO2 distribution.
  15: The study acknowledges limitations due to the rough approximation of crop production
    and national average temperatures, and the use of annual temperature data instead
    of growing season-specific data.
  16: The model acknowledges that different crop cultivars and planting times can
    lead to dissimilar responses to climate, but these factors are not accounted for
    due to data limitations.
  17: Solar radiation and precipitation are excluded due to data availability, potentially
    leading to endogeneity issues related to solar radiation.
  20: The statistical fits for soybean and rapeseed are lower than wheat and maize,
    indicating potential missing variables. Sorghum coefficients generally align with
    expectations and findings for other crops, except rice.
  22: "The notation T\u0305  and CO2 refer to the average levels of temperature and\
    \ CO2, respectively. Parameters that are underlined indicate that these are statistically\
    \ insignificant at the 10% level or better."
  24: The text mentions a tipping point of 396.2 ppm for wheat yields, implying potential
    damages, but also notes that observed crop yields have not shown these damages.
  25: The diminishing positive CO2 effects on soybean are mentioned. It is unclear
    if a tipping point for soybean yield with increasing CO2 concentration exists.
  26: The paper questions whether climate change leads to greater food insecurity,
    suggesting that while it might be compromised regionally, it might not be globally;
    the paper suggests that global CO2 is simply not a good enough proxy for identifying
    crop-specific regional effects on crop yields.
  27: The page focuses on historical yield increases and potential impacts of future
    technology and adaptation strategies, as well as the challenges of interpreting
    climate change impacts on agriculture.
  28: The page emphasizes optimism in technological advances improving agricultural
    adaptation to climate change, reducing the risk of famine.
