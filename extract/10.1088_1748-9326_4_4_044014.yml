Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in climate, including increasing temperature and other changing meteorological
    variables
  2: Ozone changes and economic damages are driven by climate change, pollution, and
    emissions from fossil fuels and other sources.
  3: Ozone concentrations are the primary driver of risk considered in this analysis.
  4: Ozone concentration changes driven by climate and emissions are impacting mortality
    outcomes.
  5: Changes in climate and precursor emissions impact mortality rates due to variations
    in ozone levels.
  6: Climate change and emissions changes affecting ozone-related health and welfare.
  7: Climate change and emissions changes are identified as drivers impacting ozone
    levels, which in turn affect mortality and economic welfare.
  8: Changes in ozone due to climate and precursor emission changes, climate change
    itself.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Human health damages (including mortality and morbidity) caused by ozone pollution,
    and their economic impacts
  2: The analysis evaluates the direct and indirect global economic costs of health
    impacts from future ozone pollution, taking into account economic damages over
    time due to health care for morbidity and mortality.
  3: Evaluates mortality from acute exposure, respiratory hospital admissions, respiratory
    symptom days, minor restricted activity days, asthma attacks, bronchodilator usage,
    and lower respiratory symptoms in children, linking ozone concentrations to these
    health outcomes.
  4: The paper evaluates mortality from acute exposure to ozone and economic impacts
    from ozone pollution.
  5: The page provides an overview of changes in mortalities due to climate and emissions
    impacts, and welfare losses linked to ozone pollution.
  6: Change in economic welfare due to ozone-related health impacts from climate and
    emissions changes.
  7: The paper evaluates the global loss in economic welfare due to ozone-related
    health impacts as well as projected mortality impacts linked to climate change
    and emissions changes by 2050.
  8: Human health and related economic impacts of ozone pollution.
Highlights:
  1: "Previous methodologies underestimate costs of air pollution by more than a third\
    \ because they do not take into account the long-term, compounding effects of\
    \ health costs. The economic effects of emissions changes far exceed the in\uFB02\
    uence of climate alone."
  3: Presents quantitative estimates of the costs of various health outcomes related
    to ozone exposure in Europe and China.
  4: Projected increase of 817,000 mortalities globally under 2050 A1B ozone precursor
    emissions with constant climate; net increase of 812,000 mortalities due to climate
    and precursor emissions changes.
  5: Significant mortality increases due to emissions in Africa, Asia, and parts of
    Europe, and a welfare loss of $120.8 billion due to climate and emissions changes.
  6: Climate change results in an annual global net loss of welfare, with disparities
    across regions; significant ozone increases in India and northern India and eastern
    China projected due to climate change.
  7: Net increase in mortalities is projected in the USA and several regions, with
    emissions changes far outweighing the climate impact; welfare loss is generally
    higher in scenarios with increased emissions.
  8: Potential reductions in ozone emissions precursors could have substantial economic
    benefits due to human health improvements.
Methodology:
  1: The MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis - Health Effects (EPPA-HE) model,
    in combination with results from the GEOS-Chem global tropospheric chemistry model
    of climate and chemistry effects of projected future emissions.
  2: A computable general equilibrium (CGE) economic modelling approach is used to
    evaluate economic damages from health impacts using atmospheric model outputs
    and population-weighted concentrations.
  3: Uses the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis model (EPPA-Health) to
    calculate health impacts and related costs based on population-weighted ozone
    concentrations in sixteen world regions. It uses concentration-response functions
    to link ozone concentrations to health outcomes, valuing health endpoints using
    willingness-to-pay (WTP) and a value of a statistical life year (VOLY) approach.
    Adjustments are made for purchasing power parity (PPP) in different regions. Linear
    relationships are assumed between ozone levels and health outcomes.
  4: The analysis employs models like EPPA and GEOS-Chem and uses Monte Carlo sampling
    for uncertainty analysis.
  5: Mortality data and welfare losses are calculated using the EPPA-HE model, with
    population-weighted ozone concentrations and a regional distribution approach.
  6: "Analysis performed using population-weighted ozone concentrations with Monte\
    \ Carlo analysis to assess concentration\u2013response and economic uncertainty."
  7: Analysis performed using EPPA-HE model to simulate impacts on mortality and economic
    welfare under different scenarios of climate and emission changes through Monte
    Carlo simulations.
  8: "Analyzes human health and economic impacts using concentration\u2013response\
    \ functions and economic valuation of health endpoints."
More Notes:
  3: The analysis uses population data from 2000 and projects it to 2050. Costs are
    reported in 2000 US dollars. The model considers both the cost of treating illness
    and willingness-to-pay to avoid damages.
  8: 40% of the median 2050 cost reflects the accumulated economic burden of previous
    elevated ozone.
Quantitative material:
  1: Health costs due to global ozone pollution above pre-industrial levels by 2050
    will be $580 billion (year 2000$) and mortalities from acute exposure will exceed
    2 million.
  2: The analysis considers increases in surface ozone levels by 1-10 ppb in polluted
    mid-latitude regions under climate change scenarios.
  3: Provides concentration-response functions linking ozone concentration to various
    health outcomes, standard errors, 95% confidence intervals, and associated costs
    for Europe and China in $2000.
  4: Table 2 shows population-weighted ozone concentrations by region, changes in
    ozone due to climate and emissions from 2000 to 2050, and the net change from
    2050 to 2000.
  5: The page presents quantitative data including changes in mortalities and welfare
    losses with specific figures such as 812,000 mortalities due to climate and emissions,
    and $580 billion in welfare losses due to ozone pollution above pre-industrial
    levels.
  6: "Annual global net loss of welfare of $790 million by 2050 due to climate change;\
    \ welfare loss due to climate and emissions changes from 2000\u20132050 with 95%\
    \ probability interval of $13 billion\u2013$190 billion; ozone pollution costs\
    \ above pre-industrial background with 95% interval of $101 billion\u2013$1.53\
    \ trillion."
  7: EPPA-HE model predicts 5000 fewer mortalities due to acute O3 exposure in 2050
    relative to 2000 when taking climate change into account; the paper provides estimates
    of welfare change in terms of 2000 dollar values.
  8: $580 billion is 0.4% of world GDP and 1.3% of US GDP.
