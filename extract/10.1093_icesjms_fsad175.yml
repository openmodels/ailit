Drivers of Risk:
  1: Species range shifts, harmful algal blooms, marine heatwaves, low oxygen events,
    coral bleaching, and hurricanes.
  3: The paper mentions shocks and stressors such as heatwaves and natural disasters
    impacting fisheries.
  4: Harmful algal bloom driven by a multi-year marine heatwave (the Blob); Hurricane
    Maria.
  5: "Harmful algal blooms driven by anomalously warm ocean conditions, El Ni\xF1\
    o conditions, and the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode are identified\
    \ as drivers of risk for aquaculture."
  6: Climate shocks such as changes in temperature, oxygen levels, and nutrient availability
    in the ocean, as well as marine heatwaves.
  7: Environmental indices, prolonged sea surface temperatures, storms, ocean temperature,
    oxygen levels, and disease risk are mentioned as drivers of risk affecting fisheries
    and aquaculture.
  8: Marine climate shocks and long-term climate change impact the outcomes for blue
    food industries.
  9: Marine heatwaves, harmful algal blooms, non-linear changes in marine food web
    productivity, extreme marine climate events
  10: The shocks driving risk include marine heatwaves, hypoxic events, and harmful
    algal blooms.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Economic risk to fisheries and aquaculture from climate shocks, impacts on blue
    food production and supply chains, and effects on coastal communities.
  3: The paper discusses the use of insurance and reinsurance as resilience strategies
    in fisheries, implicitly focusing on financial losses as the outcome being evaluated.
  4: Economic losses engendered by marine climate shocks, impacts on fisheries.
  5: The page discusses the impacts of environmental risks on aquaculture, including
    adverse effects on productivity and infrastructure, and the economic losses associated
    with events like the 'Godzilla-Red tide' in Chile.
  6: Evaluates the challenges and potential of insurance as a financial mechanism
    to address climate shocks impacting fisheries and aquaculture production.
  7: Addresses the use of insurance to build resilience against climate shocks impacting
    fisheries and aquaculture production.
  8: The paper discusses how insurance can provide economic resilience to individuals
    and sectors affected by marine climate shocks.
  9: Discusses the potential for insurance to reduce financial loss and improve sustainability
    for resource users affected by marine climate shocks.
  10: The paper evaluates the potential of insurance-based risk reduction approaches
    to protect marine resource users and coastal communities from the economic impacts
    of climate shocks.
Highlights:
  1: Financial tools like insurance are lacking in the marine sector compared to agriculture
    for managing climate-related shocks.
  3: Insurance can transfer risk from fishers/communities to insurers/reinsurers.
    Reinsurance covers insurance companies, reducing their exposure to high-claim
    events. Adverse selection and moral hazard are potential problems with insurance.
  4: Climate shocks impact fisheries, causing economic losses; government disaster
    relief is slow and may not be sufficient; insurance is proposed as a potential
    alternative to reduce vulnerability.
  5: The high economic loss and social unrest in Chile due to the 'Godzilla-Red tide'
    event represents a significant example of the vulnerability of aquaculture to
    environmental shocks.
  6: Identifies moral hazard and adverse selection as core challenges to insurance
    in marine systems. Moral hazard includes unintended risk-seeking behaviors by
    insured parties, and untruthful claims. Adverse selection occurs when those with
    a higher risk of loss are more likely to buy insurance, potentially leading to
    a market collapse.
  7: Parametric insurance offers reduced costs and quicker payouts compared to indemnity
    insurance due to the absence of loss verification. However, parametric insurance
    suffers from basis risk, i.e. error in the relationship between the index and
    losses.
  8: Insurance programs can help increase the resilience of entire blue food supply
    chains, and cooperative self-insurance can empower fishers to manage their risks.
  9: Insurance can help conserve capital reserves after climate shocks, potentially
    bolstering adaptive capacity and enabling transitions to new locations or income
    sources. Rising insurance costs can signal the need for alternative risk management
    measures.
  10: Insurance-based risk management can increase economic resilience in fisheries
    and aquaculture, incentivize sustainable behaviors, and open new markets for insurers
    and reinsurers. It can help fishing communities cope with climate change and prevent
    the collapse of their industries.
Methodology:
  1: Suggests a convergence of the insurance industry and marine sectors, fostered
    through collaboration with governments, academics, and NGOs, to develop new forms
    of insurance like ocean-index or parametric insurance.
  3: The paper discusses different types of insurance (e.g., parametric, facultative,
    treaty) and reinsurance, including how they work and when they are applicable
    in different risk scenarios.
  6: Discusses the complexities of attributing a drop in fishery or aquaculture production
    to a specific marine shock, considering factors like open ocean boundaries, animal
    movement, multiple stressors, and the difficulty in directly observing impacts.
  7: Discusses indemnity insurance, parametric insurance (index insurance), and risk-pool
    cooperatives as mechanisms for managing risk. Highlights challenges and solutions
    associated with each type of insurance.
  9: Suggests a multi-stage implementation process for marine climate shock insurance,
    including design, demonstration, and capital access.
  10: The paper proposes using parametric insurance, drawing parallels from the agricultural
    sector, to incentivize sustainable practices and provide financial protection
    against climate shocks. The approach involves tying insurance to specific geographic
    regions or groups of producers (e.g., fishery cooperatives) and adjusting premiums
    based on sustainable practices. The paper emphasizes the importance of robust
    data, analytics, and inclusive stakeholder engagement in developing and implementing
    these tools.
More Notes:
  1: The paper argues that financial risk management tools, particularly insurance,
    are central to bolstering the resilience of blue food supply chains and coastal
    communities to climate shocks.
  6: Highlights the importance of sustainable fisheries management for insurance to
    be effective and achieve both economic and environmental benefits.
  7: The page mentions the importance of social capital and trust in the success of
    cooperative self-insurance initiatives. CBFM, co-management approaches, ITQs and
    TURFs facilitate effective risk pooling and contribute to promoting sustainable
    resource management.
  8: Government involvement is crucial for promoting cooperative self-insurance and
    providing subsidies to make insurance affordable for vulnerable communities.
  9: Raises concerns about insurance propping up failing industries in the face of
    long-term climate change (e.g., fisheries shifting ranges). Suggests insurance
    mechanisms should be combined with support for long-term planning and transitions
    to alternative income sources.
  10: The paper notes that financial risk management tools, such as insurance, are
    commonplace in terrestrial food-producing sectors but lacking in the blue-food
    sector.
Quantitative material:
  4: "California Dungeness crab landings for the 2015\u201316 season reached only\
    \ 52% of the average catch of the previous 5 years, with a total value lost estimated\
    \ at US$97.5 million; Fisheries in Puerto Rico were devastated by Hurricane Maria\
    \ in September 2017: the hurricane caused commercial landings to fall by 20% due\
    \ to the loss of productive assets and power for extended periods and reduced\
    \ demand; economic losses have been estimated at US$17.8 million."
  5: The 'Godzilla-Red tide' event resulted in an export loss of approximately US$800
    million.
