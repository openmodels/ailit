Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate shocks such as species range shifts, harmful algal blooms, marine heatwaves,
    low oxygen events, coral bleaching, and hurricanes.
  2: Climate shocks (e.g., marine heatwaves, storms) impacting biological productivity
    and infrastructure; continued exposure to climate shocks impacting blue food supply
    chains and associated food and income security.
  4: Marine climate shocks (e.g., harmful algal blooms driven by marine heatwaves,
    hurricanes).
  5: "Harmful algal blooms, disease outbreaks, changes in water quality, extreme weather\
    \ events, marine climate shocks, anomalously warm ocean conditions, El Ni\xF1\
    o conditions, positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode"
  9: Extreme marine climate events (marine heatwaves, harmful algal blooms), non-linear
    changes in productivity of fisheries/aquaculture due to climate change, shifting
    marine species ranges.
Highlights:
  1: Financial tools such as insurance can help manage risks and improve the long-term
    adaptive capacity of coastal communities to marine climate shocks, incentivizing
    sustainable use of living marine resources and strengthening economic resilience.
  2: Climate shocks can impact the biological productivity underpinning operations,
    affecting catch per unit effort or shellfish growth; insurance can limit the ways
    climate shocks can impact production.
  4: Climate shocks lead to direct revenue losses in fisheries and can devastate local
    fishing industries.
  5: Marine climate shocks can be detrimental to aquaculture operations, leading to
    significant economic losses and social unrest.
  9: Insurance can help conserve capital reserves after climate shocks, bolstering
    adaptive capacity. Rising insurance costs can signal the need for alternative
    risk management measures. Insurance can provide economic resilience in the near
    term, combined with support for long-term planning. Government subsidies and support
    from NGOs could play a role in ensuring insurance viability. Insurance premiums
    can send a strong market signal that adaptation is required.
Methodology:
  1: The authors suggest a convergence of the insurance industry and marine sectors,
    fostered through collaboration with governments, academics, and NGOs to develop
    new forms of insurance, such as ocean-index or parametric insurance, as risk management
    tools.
  2: Discusses the role of insurance in maintaining capital reserves and transferring
    risk to reduce income volatility in blue-food sectors, enabling investment in
    coping with future shocks.
  9: Discusses the implementation pathway of insurance from concept to creation, including
    stages of design, demonstration, and accessing capital.
More Notes:
  2: The paper notes the challenges of moral hazard, adverse selection, and accurately
    pricing risk as major barriers to the use of insurance in the blue-foods sectors.
  4: Government disaster relief is often slow and may not fully cover losses. Marine
    insurance is discussed as a potential alternative mechanism.
  9: The paper highlights the challenge that insurance may prop up failing industries
    in the face of long-term climate change, potentially delaying necessary shifts
    to more viable alternatives. It also notes that marine climate shocks are correlated
    over large spatial scales and can deplete insurer's capital reserves without reinsurance.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Reduced profits for blue food producers and reduced overall supply of blue foods.
  2: Short- and long-term profitability and solvency across the full range of blue-food
    sectors.
  4: Direct revenue losses in fisheries due to climate shocks.
  5: Export losses, impacts on global supply and price, economic losses for aquaculture
    firms, social unrest and rioting in coastal communities
  9: Financial loss for resource users; improved livelihoods and environmental sustainability.
Quantitative material:
  4: Fisheries in Puerto Rico were devastated by Hurricane Maria in September 2017,
    commercial landings fell by 20%, economic losses have been estimated at US$17.8
    million, damaged fishing capital accounted for 51% of the losses and forgone fishing
    revenue the remaining 49%.
  5: "Export loss of \u223C US$800 million due to 'Godzilla-Red tide' in Chilean aquaculture"
