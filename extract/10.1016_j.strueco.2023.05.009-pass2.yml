Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature rise.
  2: Temperature (and its relationship to GDP), climate change, temperature shocks
  3: "Rising temperatures relative to historical norms (\u0394T > 0)."
  5: Consistent changes above or below historical temperature norms, high temperatures,
    and daily temperature variability.
Highlights:
  1: Estimates of damage through growth effects are generally much larger than those
    through level effects; Diverse impact mechanisms and adaptation effects can be
    revealed by changing the time resolution of temperature variables, introducing
    non-linearity into econometrics functions, and specifying temperature deviation;
    Combing the cross-sectional and panel model would enable us to examine the economic
    impacts at different future times.
  2: Identifies critical differences between growth and level effects of temperature
    on GDP; Summarizes characteristics of impact functions in linear and non-linear
    forms; Categorizes forms of temperature variables used in existing studies; Reviews
    development of climate econometric models and their specifications; Identifies
    channels for combining climate econometrics with IAMs; Illuminates limitations
    of existing studies and future potential directions
  3: Growth effect causes permanent damage to the economy rather than just reducing
    output in a given year as level effect does, and the damages compound over time
    for growth effect models.
  5: Non-linear temperature effects need high-resolution data; cross-sectional models
    capture long-term equilibrium effects; control variables pose challenges with
    potential bias.
Methodology:
  1: Climate econometric analysis of the relationship between temperature and GDP;
    combining empirical findings with climate change integrated assessment models
    (IAMs).
  2: Climate econometrics models to estimate the relationship between temperature
    and GDP; reviewing climate econometrics literature on the temperature-GDP nexus;
    summarizing research strands and characteristics of impact functions
  3: Discusses growth vs level effects on modelling temperature-GDP relationships;
    rising temperatures can damage the GDP level, but once temperatures have stabilised,
    the GDP can restart growth at the rate prior to the temperature rise (level effect).
    Alternatively, the damage can lower the trend rate of GDP growth (growth effect).
  5: Temperature bins are used to uncover non-linear effects of temperature on GDP;
    cross-sectional models compare regions with different climates; panel models with
    various fixed effects identify temperature-GDP relationships.
More Notes:
  1: The paper reviews literature on growth and level effects, the setting of temperature
    variables' forms and functional forms, and the inherent model specification of
    climate econometrics; Climate econometrics can expand the research scope of previous
    literature on climate change impacts that have not been previously considered
    such as labour productivity, capital and total factor productivity; Research applying
    climate econometrics to explore climate impacts can be divided into sectoral studies
    and top-down, aggregate macro-economic output studies.
  2: The study identifies the lack of consensus regarding growth and level effects,
    suggests incorporating multiple model specifications, finds increasing use of
    variables capturing climate variability, notes the potential for bias in extrapolating
    temperature-GDP relationships due to adaptation, and recommends incorporating
    existing empirical foundations into IAMs.
  3: There is minimal consensus on the identification and interpretation of growth
    and level effects in existing empirical studies.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: GDP growth and level of economic output.
  2: GDP, aggregate macro-economic output, human welfare (through GDP as a measure)
  3: GDP level and GDP growth rate are affected by temperature changes.
  5: Consistent changes in temperature impact GDP per capita growth; high temperatures
    negatively affect industrial output; daily temperature variability affects global
    economic growth.
