Drivers of Risk:
  2: Temperature; Precipitation

  5: Changes in temperature (including extreme temperatures, temperature variability,
    and deviations from historical norms) are identified as drivers of risk to GDP.
  6: Variations in temperature (short-, medium-, and long-term), weather shocks, and
    average climate conditions.
  7: The paper focuses on temperature impacts, both short- and long-term, and how
    they affect GDP growth or level. It mentions productivity and physical capital
    stock as mechanisms through which temperature impacts GDP.

Evaluation overview:
  2: Macro-economic output, measured by GDP, as a monetary unit for measuring aggregate
    macro-economic output; Human welfare
  4: No relevant information
  5: This section primarily discusses the impact of temperature on GDP and economic
    growth.
  6: Economic impacts of climate change, specifically losses in GDP and consumption.
  7: This paper discusses evaluating the economic impacts of climate change, using
    GDP as a measure.
  8: This paper reviews the development of specifications of econometrics models along
    historical lines, focusing on the temperature-GDP relationship. It aims to improve
    damage functions in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs).
Highlights:
  2: Identifies critical differences between growth and level effects of temperature
    on GDP; Examines the characteristics of impact functions (linear and non-linear);
    Categorizes temperature variables by temporal resolution; Reviews the development
    of climate econometric models and compares their specifications; Suggests future
    research should incorporate multiple model specifications to distinguish growth
    and level effects; Argues for incorporating climate variability variables and
    improving variable forms to avoid estimation bias; Recommends using comprehensive
    data and long-difference econometrics to identify climate adaptation patterns;
    Suggests incorporating existing empirical temperature-GDP relationships into Integrated
    Assessment Models (IAMs).
  4: No relevant information
  5: The use of temperature bins can reveal non-linear effects of temperature on GDP
    and identify critical temperature thresholds. Deviation from historical norms
    is important for addressing spurious correlations. Cross-sectional models capture
    net impacts after adaptation.
  6: Hybrid panel models can capture long-term climate impacts and distinguish between
    short- and long-term effects. Panel models can address unobservable confounding
    variables and integrate variations in temperature over time and space.
  7: The paper highlights the debate between growth and level effects in modeling
    climate impacts on GDP, arguing that growth effects can have a significantly larger
    long-term impact. It emphasizes the importance of accurately modeling adaptation
    and differentiating between short- and long-run effects.
  8: The paper highlights the limitations of linear specifications for long-term climate
    impact assessment and suggests the use of non-linear models to capture both short-
    and long-term impacts and adaptation. The paper suggests that climate econometrics
    research can provide empirical evidence for improving damage functions in IAMs.
Methodology:
  2: Climate econometrics models that relate temperature and GDP; Examines linear
    and non-linear forms of impact functions; Considers temperature variables with
    different temporal resolutions (annual, monthly, seasonal); Uses panel models
    and other advanced econometric techniques; Aims to distinguish between short-
    and long-run climate impacts and potential adaptation effects.
  4: No relevant information
  5: The page discusses the use of temperature bins, cross-sectional models, and panel
    models in climate econometrics to assess the relationship between temperature
    and GDP. Cross-sectional models capture long-term equilibrium effects after adaptation,
    while panel models use fixed effects to analyze changes over time.
  6: Discusses panel models with fixed effects and time trends, long difference approach
    (averaging variables over time), and hybrid panel models to distinguish short-,
    medium-, and long-term variations in weather and climate. Mentions the half-panel
    jackknife FE (HPJ-FE) estimator to address feedback effects between temperature
    and economic growth.
  7: The paper discusses integrated assessment models (IAMs) and climate econometrics,
    particularly focusing on the difference between modeling climate impacts as growth
    effects versus level effects. It advocates for differentiating between short-
    and long-run effects to identify adaptation effects more accurately. It suggests
    refining the use of long difference models (cross-sectional regressions) in growth
    rates across longer periods to model the potential adaptation effects more thoroughly
    and focusing on the deviation from long-run averages in panel data analyses to
    estimate unbiased weather impacts.
  8: The paper discusses the use of linear and non-linear panel models in climate
    econometrics, as well as cross-sectional models. It suggests using more comprehensive
    data and long-difference non-linear models to identify climate adaptation patterns.
    It also mentions hybrid panel models to distinguish impacts of short-, medium-,
    and long-run variations in weather and climate.
More Notes:
  2: This study is a review of the climate econometrics literature on the temperature-GDP
    nexus; The review identifies limitations of existing studies and suggests potential
    future research directions.
  4: No relevant information
  5: The page discusses limitations of different econometric approaches, such as potential
    biases from omitted variables and endogenous control variables in cross-sectional
    models, and the need for high-resolution data when using temperature bins. The
    paper emphasizes the importance of identifying key temperature thresholds for
    adaptation planning.
  7: The paper identifies limitations in modeling adaptation due to a lack of data
    on adaptation costs and benefits. It also notes that GDP may not fully capture
    the monetized effects of temperature change on non-market sectors such as biodiversity
    or health. The paper advocates for including multiple model specifications of
    climate econometrics into a single model to distinguish between the two effects
    in the short, medium, and long term. The paper highlights the importance of enriching
    the exploration of mechanisms by which temperature affects GDP from multiple perspectives
    by adding daily, monthly and seasonal temperature variables and related variants
    (e.g. temperature bins).
  8: The paper suggests modeling temperature shocks on GDP growth in IAMs by measuring
    the relationship between temperature impacts on macro-economic factors like physical
    capital stock and productivity. It also points out the need for further investigating
    the effects and costs of climate adaptation in the macroeconomic system and examining
    the underlying temperature effects in the trading network.
