Drivers of Risk:
  1: Floods.
  3: Floods, climate change, conflict, price shocks (wheat flour), violence
  9: Floods, price shocks, and violence are listed as drivers impacting food security
    variables.
  10: Floods, Price Shocks
  12: Floods, Price shocks
  13: Flood, Price shock
Highlights:
  1: Floods negatively impact food security (calorie and micronutrient consumption),
    decrease household income, and increase poverty in Afghanistan. Impaired livelihoods
    are the primary driver of the flood effect on food security rather than price
    hikes. Flood experience is associated with lower diet quality and quantity, and
    with consumption smoothing coping strategies like buying food on credit and taking
    loans.
  3: "Floods can lower household income and assets, detrimentally affecting calorie\
    \ and micronutrient consumption in the longer term; Shocks are responsible for\
    \ a food quantity\u2013quality trade-off; Afghanistan experiences severe micronutrient\
    \ deficiency."
  9: Flood-affected households show significant differences in food security variables
    compared to non-flood-affected ones, indicating impacts on nutritional intake
    and deficiencies.
  10: Floods negatively affect food consumption, decreasing Kcal/pc and increasing
    Kcal deficiency. Price shocks also have a negative impact on Kcal/pc and increase
    Kcal deficiency.
  12: Floods have a statistically significant negative impact on household nutrition,
    specifically reducing vitamin A and C consumption and increasing deficiency.
  13: Floods increase poverty and decrease household income. Price shocks increase
    poverty.
Methodology:
  1: Instrumental variable approach applied to data from the Afghanistan National
    Risk and Vulnerability Assessment survey.
  3: Descriptive analysis of NRVA data (2011-2012 Afghanistan National Risk and Vulnerability
    Assessment survey), 2SLS model for violence impact
  10: The analysis uses 2SLS (Two-Stage Least Squares) regressions based on NRVA (National
    Risk and Vulnerability Assessment) 2011-12 data. The regressions control for household
    characteristics, topography, and province fixed effects and are estimated using
    sampling survey weights. Standard errors are clustered at the district level.
  12: The analysis uses 2SLS (Two-Stage Least Squares) regressions on NRVA 2011-12
    data. Household characteristics, topography, and province fixed effects are controlled
    for, and standard errors are clustered at the district level.
  13: 2SLS regression using NRVA 2011-12 data, controlling for household characteristics,
    topography, and province fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the district
    level.
More Notes:
  1: The study emphasizes the need for targeted micronutrient supplementation in disaster
    relief and food aid measures even after the period of natural disaster emergency.
  3: The study focuses on Afghanistan and South Asia in general and uses household-level
    data; Considers the impact of shocks and coping strategies.
  9: The page focuses on food security analysis related to floods and other variables,
    rather than macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level.
  10: The definition of deficiency is Kcal < 2,100.
  12: The study focuses on the impact of floods on household nutrition, which is indirectly
    relevant to macroeconomic outcomes insofar as nutrition affects human capital
    and productivity. The data is specifically for Afghanistan in 2011-2012.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Impact of floods on food security, household income, and poverty status.
  3: Household calorie consumption, micronutrient consumption, food security
  9: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes or measures of economic costs and
    benefits of nation-wide adaptation mentioned.
  10: Kcal/pc (Kilocalories per person), Kcal deficiency
  12: No relevant information
  13: Poverty, household income
Quantitative material:
  1: Exposure to flooding decreases daily calorie consumption by approximately 60
    kcal. Floods increase the probability of iron deficiency by 11 percentage points,
    vitamin A deficiency by 12 percentage points, and vitamin C deficiency by 27 percentage
    points. Floods decrease income by about 3% and increase the likelihood of a household
    being poor by about 3 percentage points.
  9: Quantitative data provided on food security variables such as calorie and nutrient
    deficiencies, along with differences between flood affected and non-flood affected
    households.
  10: Flood exposure is associated with a statistically significant decrease in Kcal/pc
    (ranging from -69.334 to -57.183) and an increase in Kcal deficiency (ranging
    from 0.013 to 0.017) at a significance level of p<.01 or p<.05.
  12: Floods are associated with a statistically significant decrease in per capita
    Vitamin A and Vitamin C consumption, and a statistically significant increase
    in Vitamin A and Vitamin C deficiency. The coefficients reported can be used to
    quantify these impacts, although the units are nutritional rather than macroeconomic
    or fiscal.
  13: A flood increases poverty (0.031***, 0.025***, 0.026**), decreases income (-0.030**);
    A price shock increases poverty (0.097***, 0.081***)
