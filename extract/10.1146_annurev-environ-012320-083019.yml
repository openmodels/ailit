Drivers of Risk:
  1: Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels from fossil fuel combustion and
    deforestation, along with agriculture and land-use practices, are causing increases
    in seawater CO2 and inorganic carbon levels, reductions in pH, and alterations
    in acid-base chemistry of estuarine, coastal, and surface open-ocean waters. Climate
    change-related environmental stresses, particularly under future climate change
    and further elevated atmospheric CO2 levels, contribute to the risk.
  3: Atmospheric CO2 and the concurrent ocean acidification are projected to continue
    to rise through mid-century, if not longer, without deliberate and decisive international
    action on climate mitigation and emissions reductions.
  4: Increased atmospheric CO2 from fossil fuel combustion leads to ocean acidification,
    lowering pH and carbonate ion concentration.
  5: High-CO2 conditions and ocean acidification are identified as drivers impacting
    outcomes such as fish physiology and behavior.
  7: Ocean global change (including ocean acidification and multiple drivers of environmental
    change) is a key driver of risk impacting marine life.
  8: High CO2 conditions, hypoxia (low oxygen), temperature, and other aspects of
    ocean change are identified as drivers of risk.
  9: Anthropogenic CO2 increase causing ocean acidification, co-occurring with other
    aspects of climate change and human impacts.
  10: The primary driver of risk discussed is ocean acidification and its impact on
    various marine ecosystems.

  31: The Impacts of Ocean Acidification on Marine Ecosystems and Reliant Human Communities
Highlights:
  1: Ocean acidification puts at risk many of the valuable ecosystem services that
    the ocean provides to society, such as fisheries, aquaculture, and shoreline protection.
  3: Improved understanding is urgently needed on ocean acidification impacts from
    scientific, management, policy, and socioeconomic perspectives to develop adequate
    adaptation strategies.
  4: Ocean acidification is occurring due to rapid rise in atmospheric CO2, driven
    primarily by fossil fuel combustion. The human-induced CO2 growth rate is nearly
    two orders of magnitude faster than what occurred during the large glacial-interglacial
    transitions.
  5: Fish exhibit unexpected sensitivity to high-CO2 conditions, affecting growth
    of otoliths, mitochondrial function, metabolic rate, neurosensory processes, behavior,
    and possible disruption of GABAA-related systems.
  7: Different research approaches (mesocosms, competition experiments, acclimated
    species studies, long-term microevolution studies, multiple driver studies, CO2
    seep studies) provide information about how ocean global change impacts marine
    life at different scales of space, time, and biological organization.
  8: Adaption to high CO2 conditions is possible for microbes. Considering one factor
    of ocean change alone can yield incorrect information related to how a species
    might fare in a future ocean due to additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effects.
  9: Ocean acidification increases primary producer biomass and decreases taxonomic
    diversity. There is a trend toward the homogenization of community structure in
    space and time, attributed to altered competitive interactions. Increased primary
    production associated with high pCO2 can boost production across multiple trophic
    levels, if consumers are able to increase their consumption rates.
  10: The paper highlights changes in community structure, primary productivity, calcification
    processes, and predator-prey dynamics due to ocean acidification in critical marine
    habitats.
  11: Ocean acidification can lead to increased productivity at the base of pelagic
    food webs, but not all zooplankton benefit. Some zooplankton taxa are vulnerable
    to ocean acidification regardless of resources available. Ocean acidification
    can disrupt pelagic food webs via the proliferation of toxic algal blooms. Coral
    reefs have already suffered declines in net calcification associated with ocean
    acidification. Bioerosion may be more sensitive to changes in carbonate chemistry
    than carbonate production.
  12: Coral community shifts in acidic conditions; potential adaptation; indirect
    effects on reef-associated communities.
  13: Ocean acidification poses present-day concerns for businesses and coastal communities;
    it is very likely to decrease harvests of several bivalve shellfish species; multidisciplinary
    studies explore economics, ecosystem services, and cultural and societal institutions.
  15: Ocean acidification is expected to impact crabs, shrimps, benthic grazers, and
    bivalves in the California Current. Marine protection and ocean acidification
    have greater effects on ecosystems than adjusting fishing pressure.
  17: The foremost solution to ocean acidification is cutting atmospheric CO2 emissions.
  18: Human CO2 emissions alter surface seawater acid-base chemistry globally. Biological
    impacts reflect multiple, simultaneous chemical changes.  A wide range of biological
    responses to high CO2 exist on organism-level physiology, biomineralization, growth,
    reproduction, sensory perception, and behavior. Multiple stressors must be considered
    when determining ecological effects and any adaptation-focused intervention.
  19: Interventions designed to address other issues (e.g., biodiversity loss, water
    quality, governance) may also help address harm from ocean acidification.
  22: Negative yet variable effects of ocean acidification on marine organisms; adaptation
    to local pH conditions
  24: Ocean acidification and warming can lead to shifts in species composition, reduced
    biodiversity, changes in trophic interactions, and altered ecosystem function.

    studies of naturally acidified marine environments are used to understand the
    impacts of ocean acidification.

More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the impacts of ocean acidification in conjunction with other
    climate change-related environmental stresses. The review covers estuarine, coastal,
    and surface open-ocean waters.
  3: The review is partitioned into sections on acidification impacts on seawater
    chemistry, organismal responses to acidification, community and ecosystem impacts
    on key food-web interactions, risks to human communities, and a brief summary.
  4: The paper discusses the roles of calcite and aragonite in marine organisms, emphasizing
    their different solubilities and the impact of decreasing carbonate ion concentration
    on their stability. Coastal acidification is influenced by upwelling, excess nutrients/organic
    carbon, and freshwater fluxes.
  8: The paper notes the challenge of designing research studies to tackle the complexity
    of multiple changing parameters while remaining logistically feasible and interpretable.
    Publication bias against sharing negative experimental results may limit the representativeness
    of available data. The paper also distinguishes between organismal responses in
    lab/field settings and demonstration of ocean acidification impacts in the environment.
  9: It is challenging to disentangle ocean acidification impacts from those of other
    stressors. The effects of anthropogenic ocean acidification on coral reefs have
    not yet been confidently isolated. The probability of detecting and attributing
    change to ocean acidification will likely increase as the chemical signature of
    ocean acidification emerges from the natural variation of carbonate chemistry
    in the coastal oceans.
  15: The economic impact of ocean acidification on coral reefs is examined in relation
    to tourism and economic value. Regional vulnerability to potential losses in shellfish
    harvests from ocean acidification is greater for indigenous groups and rural communities.
  17: Existing water quality regulatory policies can help address coastal acidification
    locally. Industry-science partnerships can help address ocean acidification through
    ocean monitoring and active water quality management.
  18: The page emphasizes the need to incorporate uncertainty and disaster risk reduction
    into marine policy and governance.
  19: The paper recommends increased monitoring, targeted studies, experimental studies
    incorporating environmental context, development of adaptation solutions, updated
    management strategies, and adaptive management systems.
  22: The page includes studies focused on the California Current Ecosystem and Puget
    Sound; several studies focus on specific organisms like pteropods, krill, copepods,
    and sea urchins. Highlights the importance of considering local adaptation and
    phenotypic plasticity in species' responses to ocean acidification.
  24: Many studies focus on coral reefs and plankton communities, highlighting their
    vulnerability to ocean acidification. Several studies explore complex interactions
    and compensatory mechanisms within ecosystems.
