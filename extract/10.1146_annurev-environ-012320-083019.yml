Drivers of Risk:
  5: Increased atmospheric and oceanic CO2 concentrations, leading to ocean acidification
    (decline in seawater pH and carbonate ion concentration).
  13: Ocean acidification is very likely to decrease harvests of several bivalve shellfish
    species.
  14: Ocean acidification causing decreases in bivalve reproduction and survival,
    altered recruitment and economic value of shellfish fisheries.
  16: Ocean acidification impacts vermetid and shellfish reefs, as well as coastal
    disturbances such as trampling, sedimentation, dredging, and pollutants or poisons.
    Ocean acidification leads to reduced biodiversity, decreases ecosystem resilience
    and compromises regulating services, including habitat provision, nutrient cycling,
    and carbon storage.
  19: Ocean acidification due to human CO2 emissions; Overlapping global-scale changes
    like acidification, warming, and oxygen loss; Extreme events.
Highlights:
  5: Ocean acidification is occurring due to increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere
    and ocean, leading to a decline in seawater pH and carbonate ion concentration;
    Fish are experiencing unexpected sensitivity to CO2 increases impacting otolith
    growth, mitochondrial function, metabolic rate, larval yolk consumption, activity,
    neurosensory processes, and behavior.
  13: Ocean acidification impacts in the mid-2000s on the Pacific oyster industry
    in the Pacific Northwest framed ocean acidification as a present-day concern with
    direct implications for businesses and coastal communities.
  14: Economic damages from mollusk fishery losses in the US could be comparable to
    those from increased hurricane damages by end of century.
  16: Ocean acidification's economic ramifications for vermetid and shellfish reefs
    have not been explored, but they have important noneconomic environmental roles.
    Conservation and restoration of coastal systems to sequester carbon are being
    evaluated and promoted as part of overall carbon mitigation efforts, which may
    indirectly benefit ocean acidification. Reduced biodiversity associated with acidified
    conditions decreases ecosystem resilience and compromises regulating services.
  19: Local adaptation strategies are needed to minimize harm from the inevitable
    impacts of ocean acidification; Adaptation solutions are key priorities and will
    likely require coproduction of knowledge and close cooperation by scientists,
    resource managers, and stakeholders; Marine management strategies and adaptive
    management systems need updating to address acidification and its impacts on marine
    resources and human communities.
Methodology:
  5: "The analysis uses observational data from the Hawai\u2018i Ocean Time-series\
    \ (HOT) Program to calculate trends in surface ocean carbonate chemistry."
  14: Models with simple CO2-damage relationships and time discounting; estimates
    vary depending on per capita income and mollusk demand growth.
  19: Enhanced monitoring using autonomous ocean platforms, remote sensing, data analysis,
    and modeling; Targeted observing systems, process studies, and modeling efforts;
    Experimental studies incorporating environmental context; Increased monitoring
    and data synthesis.
More Notes:
  5: The page focuses on ocean acidification and its biological impacts on fish, particularly
    related to altered physiology and neurosensory processes, highlighting the sensitivity
    of fish to CO2 levels and the potential disruption of GABAA signaling.
  13: Detecting changes in ecosystem services and attributing those changes to ocean
    acidification is difficult because human and natural systems are constantly adapting.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  5: No relevant information
  13: Lost revenue and cultural disruption due to decreased harvests of bivalve shellfish
    species are likely to follow ocean acidification.
  14: Economic losses from decreased shellfish harvests due to ocean acidification,
    projected welfare losses, employment decreases due to ocean acidification and
    warming.
  16: "Oyster reefs provide an estimated value of $5,500\u2013$99,000 per hectare\
    \ per year via shoreline stabilization, habitat creation, and water filtration.\
    \ The economic value of blue carbon is a function of environments' carbon drawdown,\
    \ their spatial coverage, and the social cost of carbon."

    fisheries, shoreline protection, and other valuable marine ecosystem services
    due to ocean acidification; Harm to marine systems and ocean-dependent human communities.
Quantitative material:
  5: "Figure 1 shows trends in surface ocean carbonate chemistry calculated from observations\
    \ obtained at the Hawai\u2018i Ocean Time-series (HOT) Program in the North Pacific\
    \ during 1988\u20132015. It includes atmospheric and surface ocean CO2 concentrations\
    \ (ppm), seawater pH, and CO32\u2013 concentration (\u03BCmol/kg)."
  14: Projected losses of approximately 10-28% for US and UK mollusk harvests, US
    welfare losses of $400 million USD by 2100, global losses dominated by China from
    $6 billion to $100 billion USD annually.

    \ per year."
