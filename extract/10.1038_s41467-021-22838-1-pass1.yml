Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea level rise driven by anthropogenic climate change
  2: Anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR) driven by anthropogenic warming, which amplifies
    flood impacts of coastal storms.
  3: Anthropogenic climate change leading to global mean sea level rise (GMSL)
  4: Anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR) is the primary driver of increased flood
    damages.
  5: Attributable sea level rise (ASLR) from anthropogenic sources, climate-linked
    sea level rise
Highlights:
  1: 'Anthropogenic sea level rise contributed to $8.1B (range: $4.7B - $14.0B) of
    Hurricane Sandy''s damages and extended flooding to 71,000 (range: 40,000 - 131,000)
    additional people.'
  2: Human-caused sea level rise has contributed to damages associated with other
    past coastal floods and will increasingly aggravate damages in the future.
  3: Anthropogenic activities have contributed significantly to global mean sea level
    rise between 1900 and 2012.  Semi-empirical estimates for global ASLR have a high
    overlap with budget-based findings.
  4: "13% (7.5\u201323%) of Sandy damages in the tri-state area are attributable to\
    \ climate-mediated ASLR."
  5: Estimates for total climate-linked sea level rise in New York largely overlap
    with observations as well
Methodology:
  1: Simulating water levels and damage both as they occurred and as they would have
    occurred across a range of lower sea levels corresponding to different estimates
    of attributable sea level rise
  2: High-resolution dynamic flood model and spatially varying error correction to
    simulate Sandy's peak flood under actual and counterfactual conditions with lower
    baseline sea levels. Attributing rise based either on reconstructed sea-level-rise
    budgets or on semi-empirical models of sea level as a function of global mean
    temperature.
  3: Semi-empirical modeling of GMSL based on global temperature timeseries, comparing
    historical scenarios to counterfactual scenarios (stable or cooling temperatures)
    to estimate anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR). This paper applies the methodology
    of K16 through 2012.  The method also uses CMIP5 climate model simulations.
  4: Hydrodynamic modeling and spatial bias correction are used to simulate Sandy's
    flood under different sea level scenarios.
  8: Damage assessment was performed using HAZUS-MH software version MR4.
More Notes:
  1: The approach can be applied to other past and future coastal storms
  3: The study uses the HadCRUT4 global temperature record. The sea level rise projections
    are global, but estimates for the New York area are derived by multiplying the
    global results by 91%, based on a budget-based central scenario.
  4: The paper uses modeled damages to estimate relationships among damages in different
    locations and scenarios, and applies these relationships to total state-reported
    costs to develop dollar value estimates of attributable damages.
  5: Observed sea level rise total may include effects of land subsidence despite
    adjustments, potentially biasing estimates of ASLR and associated damages low.
  8: The page primarily contains bibliographic references. The study likely focuses
    on modeling the economic impacts of climate change, specifically related to storm
    surge and flooding events, with a case study on Hurricane Sandy. The mention of
    HAZUS-MH suggests a focus on direct damage assessment.
