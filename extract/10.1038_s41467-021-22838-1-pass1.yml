Driver of Risk:
  6: Sea level rise linked to climate change and its impact on coastal water levels,
    flooding, and damage in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea level rise driven by anthropogenic climate change is a key factor contributing
    to increased flooding and economic damages from Hurricane Sandy.
  2: Climate-related anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR).
  3: Global temperature timeseries, stable or cooling temperatures (counterfactual
    scenarios), natural forcing only experiments
  4: Anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR) and coastal flooding from Hurricane Sandy.
  5: Anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR) and total climate-linked sea level rise.
  7: The study examines the impact of coastal flooding due to sea-level rise (ASLR)
    during Hurricane Sandy.
  8: Storms, sea-level rise
  9: No relevant information
Evaluation overview:
  1: This study evaluates the economic damages from Hurricane Sandy attributable to
    sea level rise caused by anthropogenic climate change.
  2: Flood impacts of cyclonic coastal storms, specifically damages from Hurricane
    Sandy.
  3: Global Mean Sea Level Rise (GMSL) and Anthropogenic Sea Level Rise (ASLR)
  4: Damages from Hurricane Sandy, focusing on repair, response, and restoration costs.
  5: Property damage, population exposure, and housing unit exposure to sea level
    rise in the tri-state area (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut) and New York City.
  7: Property damage is calculated using the standard HAZUS-MH method from the U.S.
    Federal Emergency Management Agency, based on depth-damage curves which denote
    the vulnerability of a specific asset to different flood depths.

Highlights:
  1: The study provides a quantitative attribution of a significant portion of Hurricane
    Sandy's damages to human-induced sea level rise.
  2: Human-caused sea level rise has contributed to damages associated with past coastal
    floods and will increasingly aggravate damages in the future. The approach demonstrated
    here may be applied to quantify those damages. Median ASLR for New York is 87%,
    91%, and 92% of median global ASLR under low-, central- and high-attribution scenarios,
    respectively.
  3: Semi-empirical estimates for both global and New York ASLR have a high overlap
    with budget-based findings. Modeled historical results are broadly consistent
    with sea level observations.
  4: Climate-mediated anthropogenic sea level rise significantly contributed to damages
    from Hurricane Sandy. Spatial bias correction is important. Simpler models can
    serve as useful proxies.
  5: Anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR) leads to increased flood extent and depth,
    resulting in greater exposure of people and housing units and increased property
    damage.
  6: Sea level rise provides a strong foundation for event and impact attribution,
    with the study advancing progress by measuring additional exposure and damage
    associated with events like Hurricane Sandy.
  7: Damages and exposures for precise amounts of ASLR (i.e., different percentiles
    of different budget-based, semi-empirical, or integrated scenarios) are interpolated
    between results for various water levels (from 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, and 24
    cm of ASLR).

Methodology:
  1: The approach used in the study can be applied to impact assessments for past
    and future coastal storms.
  2: "Used a high-resolution dynamic flood model and spatially varying error correction\
    \ to simulate Sandy's peak flood under actual and counterfactual sea level conditions.\
    \ Global mean sea level (GMSL) increased 17.9 \xB1 4.5 cm (1\u03C3) over 1900\u2013\
    2012.  Estimates for anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR) were developed through\
    \ 2012. Budget-based attribution of sea level rise was performed, constructing\
    \ a global mean sea-level-rise budget for the study period (based on contributions\
    \ from land-ice melt, ocean thermal expansion, and land-water-storage changes),\
    \ which was then applied with GRD sea level \uFB01ngerprints to develop a New\
    \ York budget. Semi-empirical estimates were also developed, updating K16 and\
    \ finding that human-caused sea level rise contributed to damages associated with\
    \ other past coastal \uFB02oods and will increasingly aggravate damages in the\
    \ future as sea levels continue to rise, driven by anthropogenic warming. Under\
    \ the central scenario, 9.8 cm (6.4\u201313.7 cm) of global mean sea level rise\
    \ and 8.9 cm (5.2\u201313.1 cm) of New York-area rise are attributable to human\
    \ causes mediated by climate change (Table 1)."

    climate model simulations; comparison of historical and counterfactual GMSL estimates
    to attribute anthropogenic contributions
  4: Hydrodynamic modeling and spatial bias correction to simulate Sandy's flood with
    actual sea level as a baseline and then with lower sea levels to assess the impact
    of ASLR. A common damage model is then applied. Compares results with and without
    spatial bias correction and simplifications to the full model (hydrodynamic simulation
    plus damage modeling, or simulation alone).
  5: Total ensemble ASLR estimates are derived from sea-level-budget reconstruction
    and semi-empirical modeling. Hydrodynamic simulation and spatial bias correction
    are used along with flood-depth-based assessment of property damage.
  6: The analysis applies a relationship between global and New York sea-level rise
    using a budget approach, employing semi-empirical models and simulations to estimate
    damage during past and potential future storms.
  7: Hydrodynamic flood simulations are performed using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
    Coastal Storm Modeling System (CSTORM-MS). The study combines budget-based and
    semi-empirical modeling approaches to develop a total ensemble of sea level rise
    scenarios, and estimates the fraction of damages attributable to ASLR.
  8: Damage assessment was performed using HAZUS-MH software version MR4; standard
    GIS software was used.

More Notes:
  3: The study estimates anthropogenic contributions to sea level rise by comparing
    historical sea level rise with counterfactual scenarios (stable or cooling temperatures).
    The study also investigates the methodology of K16.
  4: The study focuses on the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.
    Riverine flood damages were considered negligible due to low rainfall during the
    storm.
  5: The study uses independent methodologies for estimating attributable sea level
    rise, a best practice in extreme event attribution science. The study's findings
    are consistent with observations and budgeted/modeled total global mean sea level
    rise.
  7: The study utilizes a spatially coherent bias correction to correct for errors
    in flood modeling. The code for performing spatial bias corrections and other
    analyses is publicly available on GitHub, although some code related to exposure
    assessment is not publicly available due to licensing restrictions.
