    \ were presented as follows: Supporting the formulation of adaptation strategies\u2014\
    systematic availability of impact-oriented projections and up-to-date near-term\
    \ predictions downscaled to local scale, process understanding, models and infrastructure,\
    \ downscaling, along"
  38: Gaps exist in operationalizing climate services and convincing potential users
    of their value; there is a call for integrated approaches and standardization.
  40: The demand for climate services is broadening and deepening due to increased
    focus on climate resilience and low-carbon initiatives. There's an increased focus
    on services supporting solutions and actions, particularly evident in the European
    Green Deal and the EU Horizon Europe missions. Climate services are seen as crucial
    for the success of these missions.
  42: The paper highlights the need for credible, relevant, and legitimate information
    for climate adaptation, emphasizing tested models, tailoring to the decision context,
    and transparent assumptions.
  44: "The Dutch climate change scenarios (KNMI\u201914) aggregate global and regional\
    \ climate projections into four discrete narratives that are mutually discerned\
    \ by global warming level and regional atmospheric circulation."
  45: Temperatures will continue to rise; Precipitation will increase in winter with
    more extreme events; Sea levels will continue to rise; Changes in temperature
    differ across scenarios and are greater than the natural variations; Natural variations
    are significant for different climate variables; The complexity of mapping consequences
    of remote disturbances puts strong constraints on the ability to quantify risk
    from a formalized probabilistic risk approach
  48: Comparison with historical observations alone is insufficient for validating
    impact models; global sensitivity analysis provides additional possibilities for
    model evaluation, potentially strengthening stakeholder confidence in model projections
    and adaptation strategies.
  49: The author suggests using the term 'evaluation' instead of 'validation' to highlight
    the incomplete nature of assessing a model's suitability.
  50: The paper suggests that global sensitivity analysis can help determine if parameters
    reflecting possible intervention levers adequately control the model output. It
    highlights the importance of impact models creating causal links between cause
    and effect variables for developing adaptation strategies.
  51: Wave setup uncertainty is often neglected in coastal hazard assessments and
    can invalidate conclusions if not considered.
  52: Dominant drivers of coastal defence vulnerability change significantly over
    time; wave set-up is the dominant factor up to 2050, while global climate change
    scenario matters more beyond 2070; the spatial variability in sensitivity across
    catchments was similar to that observed within catchments when assessed across
    wet and dry years.
  53: Dominant modelled processes change along a climatic gradient, and this can provide
    insight into changing model behaviour if a model is tested along climatic gradients.
  57: The paper emphasizes integrated adaptation planning mindful of multiple drivers
    of environmental change, avoiding 'climate exceptionalism'. It advocates for a
    shift away from the 'predict-then-act' framework due to growing uncertainties.
  58: The framework emphasizes collaborative dialogue among authorities, private sector
    organizations, and the legislative context, aiming for shared understanding and
    iterative decision-making.
  59: Adaptation measures should be low-regret, evidence-based and likely to deliver
    co-benefits to people and/or the environment. It may not be economically or technically
    feasible to manage impacts from most extreme scenarios, so plans are needed for
    managing "tolerable" risks against adaptation costs.
  60: Riparian shade management can be an effective adaptation measure to keep rivers
    cool, especially under hotter/drier/sunnier conditions. Cool refugia provided
    by spring flows should be protected.
  62: Stress-testing adaptation options and revealing system vulnerabilities and residual
    risks are key outcomes. The figure illustrates how changes in precipitation patterns
    impact flood magnitude under different RCP scenarios.
  65: The approach is effective in increasing the probability of avoiding maladaptation
    and improving the applicability and assimilation of scientific results by users.
  68: "An index of wide applicability for reducing the uncertainty, the so-called\
    \ Ensemble Outcome Agreement (EOA) to assessing the con\uFB01dence of the decisions\
    \ taken regarding a threshold level, such as recommended adaptation options that\
    \ are projected to provide positive adaptation values by the ensemble."
  69: The study suggests focusing on early and standard sowing dates combined with
    standard and longer cultivars for both adaptation and recovery under moderate
    climate perturbations. For adaptation alone under severe perturbations, these
    options may still provide benefit. Short spring cultivars can be used with high
    confidence when the goal is adaptation only. The study highlights the risk of
    misleading recommendations and maladaptation if this type of analysis is omitted.
  70: No relevant information
  71: Risk concept is now widely applied to climate change impact and adaptation analysis
    and further highlighted in the IPCC AR5 report.
  72: It critiques global flood models, emphasizing the quality of terrain elevation
    models, methods to estimate extreme flows, and the river network definition in
    simulating inundations.
  73: Risk reduction measures do not need to be implemented at the same time, helping
    to optimize implementation costs while reducing risk.
  74: The paper emphasizes the need for coastal authorities to assess risks and implement
    adaptive measures, and the importance of testing and validating Disaster Risk
    Reduction (DRR) measures.
  75: Process-based models such as XBeach and LISFLOOD are recommended for determining
    hazard associated with episodic erosion and/or flooding.
  76: The paper emphasizes the importance of evaluating disaster risk reduction (DRR)
    measures by simulating scenarios to understand their effectiveness in reducing
    risks from storm events.
  77: Continuity of models can allow the definition of local timeframes for coastal
    management and the optimal management approach at each moment within the next
    decades.
  78: The paper highlights the limitations of current models, including a lack of
    high-quality quantitative validation data and difficulties in direct use by end-users.
    It emphasizes the importance of addressing indirect impacts and cascade effects,
    such as economic disruption due to increased coastal flooding.
  79: The paper highlights the lack of joint use of morphodynamic models with climate
    change predictions and risk reduction measures for coastal management and aims
    to contribute to the extended use of validated coastal models for effective risk
    reduction at coastal areas.
  82: Proposes a systematic method for climate change impact and adaptation assessment
    to inform policy, focusing on sensitivity, urgency, and response. The approach
    uses observable indicators to facilitate long-term monitoring and evaluation of
    adaptation.
  86: The use of IRS analysis to estimate regional risk is illustrated. The potential
    effects of adaptation measures are also modeled, showing how they can modify impact
    thresholds and likelihood of impacts.
  87: "Climate change poses large risks of in\uFB02ow decrease and increased water\
    \ scarcity. Switching to crops with smaller water demand can increase the area\
    \ under irrigation but with enhanced sensitivity to rainfall changes."
  88: 'Three challenges highlighted for the new model-based approach to risk assessment:
    ensuring salience and credibility of impact modeling, co-exploration of current
    impact models and adaptation representation, and co-identification of critical
    thresholds for impact indicators and uncertainties.'
  90: The use of vegetation in slope stability analyses makes the modelling process
    more complex due to factors like rainfall interception and evapotranspiration.
  91: Thresholds for landslide triggering are affected by long-term precipitations
    in areas covered by deep deposits of fine-grained soils, while they are controlled
    by short-term precipitations in areas with shallower deposits with coarse-grained
    soils.
  93: NBS can represent a sustainable, efficient and cost-effective approach to reduce
    the societal risk associated with climate change and enhanced precipitation.
  94: 'Vegetation for landslide protection has positive effects: (i) increased soil
    strength due to roots, (ii) reduced pore water pressure due to plant uptake and
    canopy cover. It also has one potential negative effect: (iii) slope destabilization
    with strong winds (for trees).'
  95: The presence of vegetation influences soil parameters and processes, impacting
    the change in soil hydraulic conductivity and subsequent slope stability.
  96: Vegetation is used for erosion protection, and for shallow landslides in Europe,
    however challenges with quantifying the positive effects means use of vegetation
    is often overseen as a practical measure for landslide protection.
  97: Modelling vegetation effects on slope stability is challenging due to time-dependent
    vegetation features that differ by species. Small-scale effects of vegetation
    on slope stability are often not calculated, even though vegetation distribution
    may be spatially and temporally variable. Extreme events that imply vegetation
    (e.g., tree mortality, forest fires) need to be studied with regard to the initiation
    of extreme surface runoff and flash floods due to heavy rainfall.
  99: Single-year or single-crop assessments are insufficient for evaluating long-term
    sustainability. Crop models need more experimental data to parameterize additional
    crops for crop rotations.
  100: Warming has prolonged the thermal growing season and frost-free period for
    crops across all of Europe since the 1980s. Probability of multiple adverse climate
    events during a growing season has increased. Diversification of crop rotations
    is considered an option to increase resilience. Crop rotations play a significant
    role in resource use efficiency and can impact N surplus and losses. Winter cover
    crops prevent soils from erosion.
  101: No single model performed best across all site conditions; the mean/median
    of a model ensemble mostly provided the best estimate. There is high variability
    indicating uncertainty related to the model or its user. The interaction between
    heat and drought is genotype dependent and not sufficiently understood. The CO2
    response on photosynthesis and water use varied substantially.
  103: Highlights the need for multifactorial manipulative experiments to improve
    model-based assessments of plant growth under future environmental conditions.
  104: No relevant information
  106: Advancements in integrating human behaviour in dynamic risk assessments include
    compilation/analysis of qualitative and quantitative data, integration of qualitative/quantitative
    data into socio-hydrological models using Bayesian inference, and coupling hydrological
    flood risk models with behaviour models.
  107: Flood risk is dynamic, with hazard, exposure, and vulnerability as components.
    Effective adaptation and flood risk management have high potential to counteract
    the effect of climate change. Changing one risk component may lead to unexpected
    system behavior, such as the levee effect. Risk-based decision-making requires
    understanding, quantifying, and projecting changes in risk under an integrated,
    systems framework.
  108: The analysis suggests that integrated flood risk management, combining structural
    and non-structural solutions, can reduce vulnerability. Conversely, modern building
    standards designed for energy efficiency may increase susceptibility to flood
    damage.
  109: The primary drivers of change in flood risk, fatalities, and economic losses
    vary between flood events.
  115: The Climate-fit.City service demonstrated benefits for end user communities
    in domains like health, building energy, emergency planning, urban planning, active
    mobility, and tourism.
  119: Extreme heat increases human mortality, discomfort, mental illnesses, reduces
    productivity, increases energy consumption, affects infrastructure, agriculture,
    energy production, and poses flooding risks.
  121: The analysis found diverse potential values in improving public services, reducing
    deaths from heatwaves, and supporting evidence-based urban policy development.
  124: Weather-based insurance can help manage risks and potential losses for farmers
    in drought-prone areas
  126: WII schemes could have a great impact on making access to insurance easier
    for farmers and enhancing the resilience of farming systems. The quality of the
    weather forecast affects the optimal strategy for buying insurance.
  127: Demand for WII grows steadily with perfect weather forecasts; with imperfect
    forecasts, demand might be stable or decreasing.
  128: Producers with perfect forecasts benefit from 'perfectly efficient' adverse
    selection; imperfect forecasts lead to volatile income; climate change will exacerbate
    drought impacts on agriculture; considering non-stationary random processes will
    make the modeling relevant to climate services.
  130: Recent progress in global flood models (GFMs) supports flood impact modelling,
    with advances in modelling flood inundation in data-scarce areas. Improved flood
    hazard modelling is needed to understand how flood risk might change in the future
    with climate change.
  131: Rapid advances in the modeling of flood hazards in data-scarce areas, and a
    focus on how global flood hazard mapping innovations might support enhanced climate
    impact assessment.
  132: Airborne LiDAR data is the most accurate for flood mapping but is not globally
    available. SRTM data has been the primary source for data-sparse regions. TanDEM-X
    DEM has the potential to be more accurate than SRTM but currently has vegetation
    bias issues.
  133: There are substantial uncertainties and potential biases in flow simulations
    due to the forcing, model structure, and parameterisation in large-scale hydrological
    models.
  134: Identifies challenges in accurately mapping river locations, especially in
    low-relief areas, and parameterizing river conveyance capacity due to human alterations.
    Mentions the potential for improvement with river networks merging terrain data,
    map data, and surface water observations. Notes the potential of surface water
    dynamics inversion for a paradigm shift in GFM hydrography, especially with the
    upcoming surface water and ocean topography satellite mission.
  135: Higher resolution and more accurate process representation in flood models
    reduce the bias towards greater exposure estimates, which commonly occurs due
    to the flat nature of floodplains and the tendency of people to live adjacent
    to, but not on, floodplains.
  138: Contemporary climate risk models do not take into account adequately the sensitivities
    of cascading failure mechanisms across infrastructure networks; Socio-hydrological
    models help to overcome the gap of conventional hydroeconomic models by designing
    modular architectures; entire value chain related emission analysis and methods
    foster the much needed transparency of emissions accounting; insurance can play
    an important role in individual or collective risk reduction and adaptation to
    climate change
  139: Insurers can incentivize risk reduction through discounts, improved risk understanding,
    and targeted insurance products. Successful climate change adaptation requires
    understanding and intervening in relevant behaviors.
  140: Actors in the food system can adapt to climate change to reduce negative consequences,
    but this can create additional challenges, including further greenhouse gas emissions.
  141: LandSyMM can simulate the global food system and socio-economic development
    over long-term predictions.
  142: LandSyMM is intended to support future climate research by assessing the interplay
    between natural systems and socio-economic processes, specifically by modeling
    adaptation responses to climate change in land use, including small-scale actors'
    adaptation decisions. It addresses limitations of existing land use models that
    tend to focus on mitigation rather than adaptation and often use low spatial resolution.
    LandSyMM allows exploring adaptation measures such as crop productivity variations
    and management practices.
  143: The model captures the relationship between changes in water resources, plant
    requirements under future climates, and adaptation responses in land management.
  144: Adaptation and mitigation strategies can change food production patterns and
    may lead to agricultural productivity shifts and food substitutions impacting
    imports and exports.
  145: Agricultural adaptation measures are not necessarily positively synergistic
    with the environment and can have detrimental consequences for greenhouse gas
    emissions, fresh-water use and biodiversity loss. LandSyMM can inform policymakers
    on the trade-offs between different policy options as well as the impact on various
    aspects of the food system.
  148: Methods and models for water resource system simulation, risk analysis, and
    decision analysis provide powerful tools for dealing with the challenge of climate
    change in the water sector. These advances are now relatively mature and are increasingly
    being applied by practitioners.
  149: The paper emphasizes the importance of flexibility, robustness, and exposure
    to trade-offs in decision-making under climate uncertainty.
  150: Metrics of flexibility, robustness, vulnerability, reliability, and resiliency
    are applied to assess water resource system performance under various climate
    scenarios.
  153: Water resource system models and decision analysis methods are mature and seeing
    increasing application, though uptake in practice is less than expected; intensifying
    calls for 'outcomes-based' management of water resources and for reporting of
    climate-related risks are providing a powerful motivator for wider adoption of
    these approaches.
  155: The approach aims to select robust, reliable, and resilient water management
    portfolios, considering trade-offs between adaptation costs and reliability.
  156: "Effective adaptation should combine both structural and non-structural measures,\
    \ including regulatory and economic instruments; Selected adaptation is expected\
    \ to be economically ef\uFB01cient, environmentally sustainable, socially acceptable,\
    \ and robust"
  157: The framework aims to integrate objectives of economic efficiency, environmental
    sustainability, acceptability, and robustness at the basin scale.
  158: Local participation was key for developing an integrated vision of the evolution
    of agriculture and implications for water management in the context of the two
    SSPs and the climate change conditions corresponding to RCP 8.5.
  162: 'Scenario workshops can usefully supplement modeling methods in the design
    and assessment of climate and global change scenarios and the selection adaptation
    strategies. Decision scaling: linking bottom-up vulnerability analysis with climate
    projections in the water sector.'
  164: Recent technical, methodological, and tool-based advances made in climate vulnerability,
    risk, and adaptation modeling of large-scale infrastructure networks.
  165: The paper identifies specific issues, recent advances, and further opportunities
    in technical knowledge creation for climate adaptation modeling of infrastructure
    networks.
  167: The methodology helps to create an effective high-level screening whereby the
    efficacy of different types of adaptation options can be compared, and locations
    and assets with high (or low) adaptation benefits can be narrowed down for further
    investigation.
  170: The focus is on improving hazard modeling for infrastructure adaptation, acknowledging
    current limitations in regional climate representation and variability in estimates.
  171: Need for multi-sectoral and multi-organizational commitment to handle this
    system-of-system problem, and increased uptake for climate risk and adaptation
    methodologies supported by better data analytics.
  173: Emphasizes the need for policies insensitive to foreseeable changes and adaptive
    to unforeseen contingencies.
  174: Standard decision-making is no longer appropriate under deep uncertainty; priority
    should be given to robustness through avoidance of policies leading to unfavorable
    contingencies and avoidance of path-dependent trajectories.
  177: The modular frameworks and scenario discovery aim to identify futures where
    proposed policies meet or miss their objectives and inform the development of
    robust policies.
  178: Underlines the necessity to remove techno-institutional barriers to allow adaptive
    robustness, enabling institutions to take corrective actions more effectively.
  179: Institutions that have proven adaptively efficient are more likely to be adaptively
    robust; Longitudinal transaction cost data can help understand the emergence of
    path-dependent/adaptively robust trajectories; Water resource management is prone
    to lock-in of conventional engineering-based policies
  180: Three major recommendations focus on interdisciplinary modular hierarchy, collection
    of longitudinal data, and stakeholder integration.
  181: The research framework provides new insights for water policy and sustainable
    development, emphasizing the importance of robust adaptation policies in the water
    sector.
  183: Adaptation to climate change poses physical and transitional risks to the private
    sector, but also presents opportunities.
  185: "GHG accounting and report are in other words moving from an area of relatively\
    \ lower importance within companies to a higher degree of concern and a risk that\
    \ need to be assessed and managed in the same way as other signi\uFB01cant risks\
    \ companies need to manage and adaptation of business models."
  186: Scope 1 and 2 reporting is mandatory, while Scope 3 is optional. Inclusion
    of value chain-related emissions (Scope 3) is needed for accurate science-based
    targets in compliance with the Paris Agreement.
  187: Emphasizes the importance of collaboration across value chains for achieving
    emissions reductions in line with the Paris Agreement and EU Climate Law.
  188: ISO GHG standards can be adopted as mandatory requirements, potentially incentivizing
    companies to carry out Scope 3 analyses for a more accurate representation of
    their company's impact. Addressing Scope 3 emissions creates opportunities for
    collaboration and innovation.
  189: Strategic effort to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 according to the Green
    Deal framework.
  191: Insurance can contribute to limiting the impact of catastrophic events through
    its knowledge and expertise in assessing and pooling risks.
  192: Insurers can contribute to climate change adaptation by incentivizing risk
    reduction through premium discounts for policyholders who protect their property
    against natural catastrophes, such as floods.
  193: Significant premium reductions achieved with implementation of flood-resilience
    strategies, showcasing effectiveness in reducing flood-related damage.
  194: There is a significant protection gap for BI risks, risk transfer alone is
    not sufficient and BI can be the most important variable in the survival of a
    business after a natural catastrophe.
  196: The sharp increase in mortgage delinquency rates post-natural disasters is
    more pronounced in FEMA counties for both damaged and non-damaged properties.
  197: Prevention measures can help reduce avoidable damages from events, and without
    adaptation measures, insurance premiums may become unaffordable or insurers may
    lack financial capacity.
  210: Current assessments do not always enable to disentangle uncertainty coming
    from the climate component, the social component, the models used and the parameterisation
    used.
  212: Integration of information on changing exposure and vulnerability is needed
    to make projections of future climate risk more realistic.
  213: Adaptation measures must consider dynamic risk, influenced by both climatic
    and socio-economic changes over time.
  214: Losses from extreme weather events have risen primarily due to increased exposure.
    Integrating future dynamics of exposure is crucial for assessing planned adaptation
    measures. Changes in vulnerability also shape impacts, but are often underappreciated
    in climate impact modeling and projections.
  215: Mortality rates from storm surge floods have substantially declined over time,
    particularly in regions like Bangladesh, due to improved forecasting, early warning
    systems, evacuations, shelters, and coastal protection.
  216: The page emphasizes that climate risk metrics need adjustments based on income
    and other capacities to accurately represent risk levels.
  218: Indicates a trend towards decreasing global mortality from storm surges but
    also evidence for a sharp increase in the economic damages of extreme natural
    disasters. Also mentions empirical evidence of declining global vulnerability
    to climate-related hazards.
  220: Impact chains are perceived as (1) an appropriate means for risk analysis,
    (2) a useful tool for communication of complex cause-effect relationships in climate
    change impacts and risks, and (3) a great approach to identify entry points for
    adaptation measures.
  222: Climate risk is a function of hazard, vulnerability and exposure, which can
    be represented visually via impact chains.
  223: Vulnerability and exposure factors are complex, context-specific, and partly
    intangible. Desk-top and model-based approaches may not detect critical elements
    of a system.
  224: Qualitative understanding of vulnerabilities is often more important than quantitative
    information on hazards or impacts for adaptation planning.
  226: Impact chains are useful for analyzing and communicating complex cause-effect
    relationships in climate change impacts and risks. They can highlight impacting
    mechanisms related to different hazards and pinpoint causal relationships. Data
    availability is often a bottleneck.
  228: Presents an operational approach to include consideration of global change
    drivers in support of the design of local policies or investment plans.
  232: The framework aims to assess the robustness of different decisions or options
    within a wide range of plausible futures.
  233: "The methodology results in a comprehensive and intuitive decision support\
    \ system that helps the decision-maker to mitigate the impacts of uncertainty\
    \ and to increase the system\u2019s adaptation and resilience to scenario changes.\
    \ Identifies the most robust solution, which is the option that ranks best under\
    \ most simulated alternative scenarios."
  236: JPI Climate mobilized over 100 million EUR for climate research and aims to
    enhance societal resilience and innovation through integrated climate knowledge
    and decision support services.
  238: JPI Climate projects aim to inform and support societal transformations in
    the face of climate change, improve understanding of Arctic/Boreal systems, enhance
    user adoption of climate services, improve scientific expertise on climate change
    risks and adaptation options, and promote cross-boundary, cross-community research.
  239: The paper highlights the strategic gap in climate change assessment and communication
    at the European level and the attempt to address this gap through the development
    of pilot Knowledge Hubs (KHs).
  242: This page is a correction notice for Chapter 24 in the book 'Climate Adaptation
    Modelling'. The original publication contained an incorrect figure (Figure 24.1),
    which has been updated in the corrected version of the chapter.
  243: Average event mortality from storm surge floods varies significantly across
    different world regions and time periods (1900-1980 vs 1981-2013).
Methodology:
  7: "Presents proceedings of a high-level expert workshop on adaptation modelling,\
    \ integrated with results from the \u201CStudy on Adaptation Modelling\u201D (SAM-PS)\
    \ commissioned by the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Climate\
    \ Action (DG-CLIMA) and implemented by the CMCC Foundation. It also presents an\
    \ overview of technical, financial, economic, and non-monetary models and tools\
    \ for climate change hazards, exposure, vulnerability, and adaptation assessments."
  9: No relevant information
  11: review of climate change adaptation modelling methods and tools; developing
    guidance for their application; providing use-cases as operative examples for
    their rapid deployment
  15: Model-Based Response Surface Approach; Dynamic Flood Risk Modelling; Sectoral
    Models for Impact and Adaptation Assessment; Top-Down Meets Bottom-Up Approach
  17: Modelling adaptation to support informed decision-making for implementation;
    Prioritization of adaptation options requires extended decision support methods.
  19: The papers discussed evaluate and propose improvements to climate change impact
    models, focusing on local/regional implications, Global Sensitivity Analysis,
    stress-testing adaptation options, and managing uncertainty in agricultural projections.
  21: The paper provides a targeted review focusing on Integrated Assessment Models
    (IAMs) with a specific emphasis on damage functions and adaptation modeling.
  24: The table describes different IAMs and PEMs, noting their regional scope, the
    type of damage function used (e.g., linear-quadratic, quadratic, complex), and
    how they handle adaptation and geoengineering. Models can be cost-benefit (CB-IAM)
    or policy evaluation (PEM).
  25: "IAMs can include adaptation explicitly (conducting a cost\u2013benefit analysis),\
    \ implicitly (damage function is net of adaptation), or occurring autonomously\
    \ (impacts fade at zero cost)."
  27: Economic impact assessments using multi-region, multi-sector computable general
    equilibrium (CGE) models and a macroeconomic model (GRACE) based on standard economic
    relationships.
  28: GRACE is a global computable general equilibrium model using national accounts
    data from the GTAP database. It finds the combination of prices and quantities
    under the assumption of market equilibrium. Regional and sectoral aggregation
    is flexible. Applicable for assessing trade-offs between climate change mitigation
    and adaptation policies.
  29: Uses the GRACE model to assess global consequences of climate change on standardized,
    economic indicators. GRACE includes adaptation in production (substitutability
    among production inputs, mobility of labor and capital) and consumption (substitutability
    between imported/domestic goods and commodities).
  30: The analysis uses the GRACE model with a modified module for forest management,
    treating standing biomass as wealth similar to capital stock and harvesting as
    the return on this wealth.
  32: Uses the GRACE model implementing autonomous adaptation like air conditioning
    and mechanization, based on SSPs and regression projections.
  34: Supported by European Union's Horizon 2020 programme, focusing on economic analysis.
  35: No relevant information
  36: The Roadmap defined climate services as the transformation of climate-related
    data into customized products, including projections, forecasts, information,
    trends, economic analyses, assessments, counselling, development and evaluation
    of solutions.
  37: Stakeholder engagement workshop (November 2017) at the request of the European
    Commission; position paper prepared by Climateurope (2018); recommendations for
    the Horizon Europe (HEUR) framework programme; recommendations elaborated within
    Climateurope by a group of European experts in climate modelling and climate services.
  38: The recommendations are linked to challenges in research for climate services,
    suggesting a qualitative approach to gathering climate service requirements and
    understanding value perception.
  40: The page discusses the need for assessments of the impacts of past investments
    (e.g., Horizon 2020) and systematic assessments of remaining and emerging challenges
    in the climate services market. It also explores the extent to which climate products
    and services can support and inform climate adaptation.
  42: The paper explores storyline development approaches to select relevant and credible
    pathways and events to understand risks and options. It discusses climate scenario
    storylines and climate risk storylines using use cases.
  43: The paper discusses the use of scenario construction and the development of
    storylines to explore future conditions and potential impacts of climate change,
    particularly emphasizing climate scenario and climate risk storylines.
  44: "The Dutch climate change scenarios (KNMI\u201914) condense ~250 global and\

  68: The EOA index can be used to discard adaptation options that are promising in
    terms of adaptation response but show low confidence.
  69: The study emphasizes the need for techniques managing uncertainty in agricultural
    projections. It suggests that adaptation of winter wheat in Spain relies on finding
    local optimal combinations of cultivars and management. In NE Spain, switching
    to spring cultivars (no vernalization requirements) with standard and longer cycle
    lengths, combined with early and standard sowing dates in autumn, could benefit
    winter wheat under future conditions.

    climate change), emissions/land-use change, and socioeconomic processes (socioeconomic
    pathways, adaptation/mitigation actions, governance) to determine risk.
  73: The presented methodology is adaptable to any coastal region.
  75: The analysis emphasizes the importance of considering feedback mechanisms, regional
    data availability, dominant physical and morphological conditions, selected onshore
    hazards, selected receptors, and climate change predictions in modeling. Results
    of hazard models are translated into impact using damage curves or other relationships.
  76: The focus is on using models for decision-making regarding coastal risk prevention
    and adaptation, highlighting different types of DRR measures such as 'exposure-reducing'

    development.
  98: This page appears to be a list of references from a larger document about the
    use of vegetation for landslide risk mitigation.
  99: The study focuses on European crop production, but the methodological points
    regarding crop rotation modeling may be relevant to US agriculture.

    other than heat and drought. The statement of higher CO2 stimulation, when crops
    are under water stress, cannot be applied universally.
  103: Notes limitations of current models in simulating crop rotation effects (e.g.,
    rooting depth), mixed cropping systems, and tillage effects.
  104: No relevant information
  109: The page introduces socio-hydrological modelling approaches (stylized models,
    system-of-systems models, and agent-based models) but doesn't provide results

    is left for future research; Model improvements, such as using real-world field
    data for crop yield parametrizations and deriving weather indices from observations/forecasts,
    are planned for future research.
  128: The model currently uses stationary random processes for weather indices but
    suggests that non-stationary processes should be considered to account for climate
    change impacts and statistically significant trends.
  129: This page contains only references and licensing information; there is no original
    research presented.

    making uncertainty understanding and benchmarking difficult. A sophisticated GFM
    can be undermined by one of its components (e.g., DEM data).
  140: There is a focus on the interaction between adaptation and mitigation in the
    land use and food system, an area that has received less emphasis than land-based
    climate change mitigation.
  141: Adaptation mechanisms can be direct (response to local climatic conditions)
    or indirect (response to market/policy).
  142: Current models often neglect the implementation of adaptation decisions by
    small-scale actors.
  144: Climate mitigation actions like bioenergy and reforestation can affect agricultural
    land availability and increase food prices.

    can be explored through adding and better representing models and scenarios.
  178: Emphasizes that adaptively efficient institutions are those that can handle
    evolving and complex dilemmas over long periods despite uncertainty and unforeseen
    shocks.
  179: The paper discusses institutional lock-in, which can constrain the ability
    to take corrective action in water resource management.
  181: Policymakers in water and related sectors will benefit from the methodological
    and empirical insights of the research framework.

    with the ultimate goal being a harmonized methodology to create a detailed emissions
    inventory and risk disclosure.
  185: Mentions sustainable finance action plan and the European taxonomy on sustainable
    finance as vehicles for the Green Deal.
  186: The page emphasizes the importance of including Scope 3 emissions in GHG assessments,
    even though it's more complex and prone to double-counting or omissions. It also
    notes the limitations of both EEIO (sector aggregation errors) and LCA (truncation
    errors) methodologies.
  187: The page focuses on GHG emission assessments and reporting within the private
    sector and touches upon challenges like data availability, harmonization, and
    the complexity of ISO standards.
  188: The page provides a flowchart illustrating the relationships and sequence of
    various ISO standards related to greenhouse gas management (ISO 14064-1, ISO 14064-2,
    ISO 14067, ISO 14064-3, ISO 14065, ISO 14066).
  189: Focus on integrating emissions accounting into business value chains and aligning
    it with financial transparency standards.
  192: Focuses on the role of insurance in climate change adaptation through underwriting
    and pricing, specifically highlighting the potential of incentivizing risk reduction
    measures in property insurance (e.g., flood prevention).
  194: Standard BI insurance policies are often an 'annexe' to property insurance
    and don't offer individual assessment of BI risk, which may be insufficient when
    there is damage to the wider area.
  206: This page outlines frameworks for influencing behavior and assessing interventions,
    but does not provide any direct climate impact results.
  210: Highlights the need to increase the availability, reliability, and accessibility
    of climate information with the 'right' spatial resolution, improve the quantitative
    empirical basis on the cost and effectiveness of climate change adaptation, and
    develop systematic guidance tools and case studies.
  212: Risk metrics outputs alone are not sufficient to predict adaptation outcomes
    and must be placed in the local context.
  214: The page argues that some studies incorrectly attribute past losses solely
    to climatic changes, overlooking the major driver of increasing exposure. It emphasizes
    the importance of including socio-economic developments in assessing climate impacts.
    The use of fixed vulnerability is criticized as leading to potential underestimates
    of future risk.
  220: The framework has been applied in almost twenty national climate risk assessments
    worldwide (e.g., Burundi, Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam, Madagascar).
  222: The participatory approach emphasizes stakeholder engagement to create a shared
    understanding of climate risks and integrate local knowledge.
  223: The impact chain methodology helps reveal critical elements of a system, such
    as insufficiently maintained flood protection infrastructure or informal settlements
    in potential flood zones.
  224: "Risk assessment should not be driven by data availability only. A typical\
    \ \uFB01nal result is a report with detailed description of each single climate\
    \ risk consisting of a mix of narrative information, graphs and maps with information."
  226: Validation of hybrid and hypothesis-driven methods is a challenge and an area
    for future research. Risk assessment is value-based, dependent on priorities and
    normative settings, and should include a discussion on which effects fundamentally
    threaten a system.
  228: Focuses on medium term perspective (10-40 years). Acknowledges the prevalence
    of economic signals in the shorter term and climatic signals in the longer term.
  230: This paper emphasizes decision-making under deep uncertainty in the context
    of climate change and adaptation, focusing on identifying robust solutions rather
    than optimal ones.
  233: 'Applications mentioned: Outlook 2030 project, CORASVE projects financed by
    the Veneto Region administration, climate proofing of hydraulic safeguarding of
    infrastructures, decarbonisation and renewable energies, tourism and electric

    and Humanities communities to enable and accelerate positive transformation.
  240: This page focuses on the role of the JPI Climate initiative in coordinating
    climate change research and informing policy in Europe, particularly in relation
    to adaptation. It does not directly present original climate impact research or
    data.
