  232: Plausible trajectories of variables related to different aspects of the future
    are considered to understand potential consequences of changes in climate-related
    driving forces.
  233: Future climatic scenarios and socio-economic factors impacting decision making
    for climate change adaptation.
Highlights:
  9: The EU adaptation strategy shifts focus from understanding the problem to developing
    solutions and moving from planning to implementation.
  10: States the overall objective is to support better informed decision-making on
    adaptation. Emphasises the importance of adaptation modelling in the nexus between
    climate hazards and socioeconomic vulnerability and inequality.
  21: IAMs can be used for economic assessment of climate policies.
  22: Adaptation modelling is complex due to sector-specific measures, varying vulnerabilities
    of regions, and choices made by individuals and society regarding adaptation strategies.
  25: IAMs often do not consider the variety of adaptation possibilities at local,
    regional, and sectoral levels, leading to limitations.
  29: Without mitigation policies, the impacts of climate change on economies can
    be large, which implies high costs of adaptation; RCP4.5 may represent an optimal,
    global strategy, as it leads to a stabilization of climate change impacts in the
    long term; adaptation among economic agents results in price effects with impacts
    on sector composites and trade.
  30: Without adaptation, climate change leads to a reduction in the value added from
    forests world-wide. Adaptation related to management and harvesting turns the
    impacts positive. Impacts vary a lot across regions and RCPs.
  31: Macroeconomic assessment underestimates the vulnerability of people in the agricultural
    sector compared to micro-based assessments.
  32: Heat stress under RCP8.5 could reduce GDP by 1.4% by 2100, but autonomous mechanization
    can mitigate this decline by 0.4 percentage points.
  33: Adaptation plays a key role in diminishing adverse impacts of climate change;
    top-down and bottom-up approaches have complementary strengths that are not yet
    fully realized; many adaptation measures are implemented autonomously in CGE models
    based on socioeconomic scenarios; better integration of proactive adaptation under
    uncertainties into macroeconomic models is needed.
  34: Economic costs of heat-induced reductions in worker productivity are analyzed.
  48: Comparison with historical observations alone is insufficient for model validation;
    global sensitivity analysis provides additional possibilities for model evaluation.
  51: Global climate change scenarios only matter for long-term planning of coastal
    flood defences, while local factors such as near-shore coastal bathymetry dominate
    in the short and mid-term (~over the next 50 years).
  52: Dominant factors influencing coastal defenses change significantly over time,
    with wave setup being crucial until 2050, then global sea-level rise becoming
    most dominant.
  56: Robust decision making frameworks are recommended for evaluating project performance
    under a range of credible scenarios.
  58: Stresses the importance of collaborative, participatory, and iterative decision-making
    processes that focus on resilience and robustness under conditions of uncertainty.
  62: Deep uncertainty about the future climate and other major drivers of global
    change are not impediments to adaptation planning and options appraisal provided
    that decision-led (rather than scenario-led) frameworks are implemented.
  68: The Ensemble Outcome Agreement (EOA) index helps to discard adaptation options
    that are promising in terms of adaptation response but show low confidence, in
    favor of those with more confidence.
  72: "Representation of climate uncertainty is a main challenge; novel bottom-up\
    \ approaches can apply stress tests; impact response surfaces can depict modelled\
    \ sensitivity of indicators; better quanti\uFB01cation is needed of the hazard\
    \ reducing effect of nature-based solutions; important dynamic interactions between\
    \ abiotic and biotic components need to be considered in adaptation modelling;\
    \ dynamic interaction between hazards and human behaviour is key; high resolution\
    \ and quality climate and hazard data are instrumental."
  81: The approach tests the feasibility of applying impact models across sectors
    to represent sensitivity, urgency, and response related to climate change. It
    aims to determine the effectiveness of potential adaptation and mitigation responses.
  86: The IRS method is presented as a novel approach for estimating future climate-related
    risks, but the paper notes that its practical merits have yet to be demonstrated
    for sectors beyond water resource management and agriculture.
  100: Climate change is affecting cropping systems through increased yield variability
    and crop loss risk. Adaptation strategies include new varieties, diversification
    of crops, and shifted cultivation dates.
  106: Effective flood risk management is highly relevant for advancing climate change
    adaptation. Flood risk modelling needs to consider the dynamics, complex interactions,
    and feedbacks in human-flood systems.
  108: An observed reduction in flood impacts was driven mainly by reductions in vulnerability.
    Integrated flood risk management complements structural protection with non-structural
    solutions.
  111: Flood risk assessment modeling highlights the importance of spatial scale in
    determining vulnerability scenarios.
  121: Urban climate services represent a relevant tool that can provide scientific
    support for potential improvement of the effectiveness into a range of public
    services, and potentially provide relevant support for the development of evidence-based
    urban policies.
  124: Sharing the burden of adaptation is key for the agricultural sector in developing
    countries. Weather-based insurance schemes (WII) can overcome some of the losses.
  125: Crop insurance is an important adaptation mechanism, but is often expensive
    and unaffordable; Weather-based index insurance (WII) can be a cheaper and more
    affordable alternative; WII increases the resilience of farming systems towards
    risks.
  127: With perfect weather forecasts, there is steady growth in the number of insured
    farmers. With imperfect forecasts, the number of insured farmers might be very
    stable or even decreasing.
  128: Perfect forecasts lead to more efficient adverse selection and potentially
    higher income, while imperfect forecasts result in lower and more volatile income
    for producers compared to always having insurance.
  135: Resolution and process inaccuracy tend to bias simulations towards greater
    exposure estimates; global flood models disagree on where is at risk more often
    than they agree. Validation studies on individual GFMs usually conclude they are
    more accurate than the model benchmarking suggests, indicating that the validation
    studies to date are far from comprehensive, must pick easy to simulate locations
    and that the accuracy of GFMs is highly variable.
  140: Focuses on the interaction between adaptation and mitigation in the land use
    and food system, an area that has received less emphasis compared to land-based
    climate change mitigation.
  141: LandSyMM can be used for climate adaptation assessment, particularly related
    to food security and land allocation.
  144: "LandSyMM captures dietary requirements and preferences at the country level\
    \ and how consumption changes in response to income levels as well as endogenous\
    \ country level food commodity prices; The changing risk of shocks, such as drought\
    \ and \uFB02ood risk, can be simulated by processes endogenous to LandSyMM."
  145: Agricultural adaptation measures are not necessarily environmentally synergistic
    and autonomous adaptation can be detrimental to environmental externalities, including
    greenhouse gas emissions, fresh-water use and biodiversity loss. Expansion of
    agriculture can lead to carbon losses and intensification to negative environmental
    consequences. LandSyMM can inform policymakers on the trade-offs between policy
    options and their impact on the food system.
  155: The approach supports the selection of adaptation measures at the river basin
    level by integrating economic efficiency, social acceptability, environmental
    sustainability, and adaptation robustness. It helps select robust, reliable, and
    resilient water management portfolios.
  168: "Benefits of adaptation investments could safeguard US$ 7\u201323 of economic\
    \ value for every US$ 1 invested in Vietnam."
  169: Policy makers lack knowledge on spatial network vulnerabilities and risks,
    resulting in investments often not being prioritized with the aim of building
    systemic resilience. This gap is being filled as network analyses become more
    prevalent and achievable due to increased data availability.
  173: Standard decision-making based on probabilistic descriptions of the future
    is no longer appropriate.
  174: Standard decision-making based on probabilistic descriptions of future conditions
    is no longer appropriate under deep uncertainty; priority should be given to robustness.
    There is a gap in the scientific literature regarding consolidated modeling and
    empirical assessments of public transaction costs.
  180: Need to overcome techno-institutional lock-in to enable transition to superior
    water policies; Incremental change in public institutions hinders transformational
    responses; Importance of science-policy synergies for robust policies.
  181: Methodological and empirical insights on trade-offs and distributive implications
    of adaptation policies in the water sector.
  183: "A harmonized methodology is needed to create a detailed emissions inventory\
    \ and risk disclosure of a company\u2019s operations."
  185: Transition risks in the private sector are becoming more existential and require
    more complete, clear, and harmonized methods for assessment and reporting. GHG
    accounting and reporting are moving from an area of relatively lower importance
    to a higher degree of concern for companies.
  189: A harmonized accounting method for GHG emissions is crucial for transparency
    and the Green Deal; Companies need to acknowledge and reduce emissions for preparedness
    in the green transition; Value chain-related emission analysis should be included
    in the Platform on Sustainable Finance expertise areas.
  194: There is a significant protection gap for BI risks; risk transfer alone will
    not be sufficient to ensure sustainable insurance coverage.
  195: The role of insurance in promoting proactive management of business interruption
    (BI) risks and improving creditworthiness through adaptation measures, thus potentially
    reducing risk.
  196: Natural catastrophes significantly increase mortgage delinquency rates, even
    for properties with no damage, illustrating the broader economic impact of climate-related
    events; adaptive measures like property insurance and business contingency planning
    can potentially reduce these risks and associated costs.
  197: Climate change necessitates adequate risk transfer products, and innovative
    risk solutions require data sharing between public and private stakeholders to
    ensure risks remain insurable. Prevention measures should be integrated into insurance
    products to reduce avoidable damages, not just transfer risk.
  209: "Many models provide information with a spatial\u2013temporal resolution which\
    \ is too coarse compared with that of many adaptation policy decisions, particularly\
    \ those at the urban, municipal level. Climate change impact, vulnerability and\
    \ adaptation assessments can exceed the funding and technical capacity of smaller\
    \ administrations and the time needed to release such analyses is often too long\
    \ compared to that of decision-making."
  210: Current assessments often fail to disentangle the sources of uncertainty in
    climate change impact assessments. Most models focus on climate change risk and
    impact assessment, with fewer addressing the full adaptation policy cycle. Integrating
    top-down modeling with local experience is key to effective adaptation.
  212: Current climate risk products may fall short of informing adaptation decision-making
    on the ground because they don't incorporate local context.
  223: Impact chains can reveal critical elements of a system (vulnerability and/or
    exposure factors) that desk-top or model-based approaches might miss. Vulnerability
    and exposure factors are predominantly complex, context-specific, and partly intangible.
  232: Scenario development and participatory qualitative scenarios are vital for
    understanding future problems and opportunities and integrating multiple points
    of view.
  233: The decision support system helps identify robust solutions for climate change
    adaptation by simulating alternative scenarios.
Methodology:
  21: The paper reviews Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), distinguishing between
    cross-sectoral optimization models (POMs) and economic assessment of climate policies
    (PEMs). It identifies 'generations' of models that enhance the scientific understanding
    of climate change and influence economic recommendations for climate policy.
  22: Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), including CGE (Computable General Equilibrium)
    and PE (Partial Equilibrium) models, are used to analyze climate change. Models
    range from welfare optimization to cost minimization. The recent trend is towards
    modularized, open-source IAMs (MIMI models).
  25: Adaptation is included in IAMs explicitly, implicitly, or autonomously, but
    with highly aggregated approaches lacking granularity.
  28: The paper describes the GRACE model, a global computable general equilibrium
    (CGE) model calibrated using GTAP data. It models the interactions between production
    sectors, consumption, and international trade to simulate economic outcomes under
    different scenarios. The model allows for flexible regional and sectoral aggregation.
  29: Uses the GRACE model to assess global consequences of climate change on economic
    indicators and economic development.
  30: The GRACE model with a modified module for forest management is used, where
    standing biomass is interpreted as wealth and harvesting as the return of this
    wealth. Analysis is performed for 27 countries. Results are applicable to the
    economic consequences of climate change on biomass in forests.
  31: Comparison of macroeconomic (GRACE model) and micro-level household studies
    under a high emission pathway (RCP8.5) up to 2050
  32: Economic impact assessment using the GRACE model, implementing autonomous adaptation
    such as air conditioner penetration and mechanization of outdoor work, linked
    to different SSPs. Mechanization projections are extrapolated based on a regression
    analysis using tractors per hectare as a proxy and GDP per capita as an explanatory
    variable.
  33: Compares top-down (CGE models) and bottom-up modelling approaches for adaptation;
    suggests integrating results and methodologies from local studies into broader
    macroeconomic models; advocates for interdisciplinary studies combining top-down
    and bottom-up approaches.
  34: Uses the GRACE model; CGE modeling (likely implied by reference to GTAP)
  48: Impact models are used to translate potential future climate conditions into
    variables of interest to create causal connections between climate and impact
    for scenario-based analyses. Global sensitivity analysis is suggested as an additional
    model evaluation tool to ensure transparency and robustness of model-based analyses.
  51: Global sensitivity analysis is used to determine factors that most strongly
    control the vulnerability of coastal flood defenses over time.
  52: Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) used to assess temporal sensitivity of factors
    affecting coastal defense vulnerability.
  56: "Stress-testing options using models of the system being managed and assessing\
    \ against decision-relevant performance indicators; Field experiments and model\
    \ simulations to test costs and bene\uFB01ts of adaptation measures; Monitoring,\
    \ evaluation and learning to benchmark bene\uFB01ts."
  58: Highlights the use of robust decision making frameworks comprising portfolios
    of management options, system models, project performance metrics, and options
    appraisal criteria.
  59: Control experiments or counterfactual simulations are needed to benchmark outcomes
    'with' versus 'without' adaptation.
  62: Stress-testing of physical (field-based) or virtual (model-based) systems under
    climate change, with and without adaptation, to reveal the efficacy of adaptations,
    system vulnerabilities, and residual risks. Expert elicitation and ranking of
    options performance under different storylines.
  72: "Uses down-scaled GCM projections; applies stress tests to analyse combinations\
    \ of stressors; uses impact response surfaces to depict model sensitivity; modelling\
    \ vegetation behavior for landslide mitigation; modelling crop sensitivity to\
    \ climate and soil hydrology; analyzing dynamic trends in hazard, exposure and\
    \ vulnerability indicators; using high-resolution climate and hazard data combined\
    \ with user-speci\uFB01c vulnerability information; assesses the quality of global\
    \ flood models based on terrain elevation, flow estimation, river network definition,\
    \ and numerical simulation."
  81: The paper presents a 'Response Surface Approach' using impact models across
    sectors to assess climate change impacts and adaptation. It involves constructing
    Impact Response Surfaces (IRSs) based on impact model simulations, capable of
    simulating some adaptation measures. The approach focuses on climate-sensitive
    sectors and uses observable indicators for long-term monitoring and evaluation
    of adaptation success.
  84: 'A modelling methodology is being designed to ensure commonality of approach
    between sectoral applications, requiring collective decisions agreed upon early
    in the assessment through co-design across sectors and between researchers and
    stakeholders. This involves modelling impacts of climate change for key indicators
    co-selected with stakeholders across a range of sectors, relating these impacts
    to impact thresholds and simulating the effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation
    in ameliorating key risks. The IPCC Risk Framework is operationalized, depicting
    climate change risk (R) as a function of hazard (H), exposure (E), and vulnerability
    (V): R = f(H, E, V).'
  86: The paper describes an 'Impact Response Surface' (IRS) method, which combines
    yield sensitivity to temperature and precipitation with probabilistic climate
    projections to estimate future climate-related risks. This is applied to crop
    yield shortfall.
  100: The analysis focuses on the impact of climate change on agricultural production
    systems in Europe, with an emphasis on crop rotations and their management.
  106: Dynamic flood risk modelling that considers the dynamics, complex interactions,
    and feedbacks in human-flood systems. Integration of qualitative and quantitative
    data into socio-hydrological models using Bayesian inference and the coupling
    of hydrological flood risk models with behavior models in socio-hydrological modelling
    systems are recommended.
  108: Paired event case studies around the world. Modelling approaches that consider
    drivers of risk along with their interactions and feedbacks. Temporal trend analyses
    on flood damage data.
  111: The analysis involves a series of modeling steps including weather generation,
    rainfall-runoff modeling using SWIM, river network routing with a 1D hydrodynamic
    model, hinterland inundation modeling with a 2D raster-based hydrodynamic model,
    and flood loss assessment using the FLEMOps+r model.
  119: Statistical downscaling of global and regional climate model outputs to the
    local scale of the city; Perturbation of local time series of measured precipitation
    intensity according to climate change signals obtained from climate model outputs.
  124: Presents weather-based insurance schemes (WII) based on weather index objectively
    determined for the specific agricultural region. Examines decisions based on perfect
    and imperfect weather forecasts.
  127: Uses a conceptual model for Weather Index Insurance (WII) with a simple power
    law for crop yield dependence on the weather index and a simple random process
    for actual and forecasted weather index dynamics.  Analyzes adverse selection
    in a hypothetical scenario where only policy buyers base decisions on weather
    index forecasts.
  128: A simple Weather Index Insurance (WII) model simulates the stochastic dynamics
    of weather, comparing outcomes under 'always insurance,' 'perfect forecast,' and
    'imperfect forecast' scenarios. The methodology could be adapted to incorporate
    non-stationary random processes and climate change effects.
  135: Simulating inundation over two-dimensional grids. Global Flood Models (GFMs)
    that can use numerical schemes.
  140: Presents a modelling approach to better understand and plan the interactions
    between climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the land use and
    food system.
  141: The paper outlines the Land System Modular Model (LandSyMM), a coupled model
    that integrates commodity consumption, land use management, vegetation, and climate
    into a worldwide dynamic economic system at a fine spatial scale. It simulates
    the global food system and socio-economic development over long-term predictions.
  142: The paper describes a coupled model system, the Land System Modular Model (LandSyMM),
    which aims to support future climate research by assessing the interplay between
    natural system dynamics and socio-economic processes related to supply and demand.
  144: Uses LandSyMM to simulate the effects of shocks and policies on food systems,
    diet, land use, and climate; Allows implementation of policy levers such as international
    trade tariff barriers and agricultural subsidies.
  145: LandSyMM model is used to predict changes in surface runoff between 1971-2000
    and 2071-2100 under different SSP and RCP scenarios.
  150: The analysis involves simulation modelling to test and explore shocks and scenarios
    on water resource systems, incorporating metrics of vulnerability, reliability,
    resiliency, flexibility, and robustness across large sets of plausible future
    climate scenarios.
  158: The study uses a mixed-methods approach, combining narrative storylines with
    quantitative scenarios to assess future irrigation water demand under climate
    change. It involves expert interviews, participatory workshops with representatives
    from the local agricultural sector, and agroclimatic simulation models.
  166: Proposes a hybrid top-down and bottom-up climate vulnerability, risk, and adaptation
    assessment of infrastructure networks.

    \ toward robust decision-making; proposes a modeling hierarchy of human\u2013\
    water systems and longitudinal accounting of public transaction costs."
  174: The paper proposes an interdisciplinary, replicable, and scalable research
    framework integrating data and methods from (socio-)hydrology and economics to
    quantify the implications of adaptation policies. It emphasizes the importance
    of a modeling hierarchy and longitudinal accounting of public transaction costs.

    of data and methods from natural and social sciences; Development of a flexible
    and interdisciplinary modular hierarchy for multi-system ensembles; Econometrics

    of alternative solutions to water-related challenges; application of the research
    framework will provide new insights for water policy.
  183: "Environmentally Extended Input\u2013Output models are used as a screening\
    \ tool to identify emission-dense sectors. Process-based LCA inventory data is\
    \ used to increase the resolution of decision-making tools."
  185: The text mentions the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) as a method used
    by companies to assess and report transitional climate risks.

More Notes:
  7: This preface introduces a book focusing on the gap between adaptation science/modeling
    and policy making at different levels. It highlights the proceedings of a workshop
    and a study (SAM-PS) commissioned by the European Commission. The book presents
    an overview of models and tools for climate change hazards, vulnerability, and
    adaptation assessments, focusing on their usability for policymakers. It also
    proposes practical approaches for adaptation assessments and discusses the interconnections
    between science and policy of adaptation.
  9: Emphasis on smarter adaptation through data collection and sharing, promotion
    of nature-based solutions, and consideration of fiscal policies.
  10: The EU Adaptation Strategy emphasizes the need to advance on adaptation modelling,
    risk assessment and management tools. The Commission supports the development
    of rapid response solutions for decision makers and aims to enrich the toolbox
    for adaptation practitioners.
  21: The paper focuses on damage functions and adaptation modelling within IAMs.
  22: Early IAMs underwent a 'learning by doing' phase, improving the understanding
    of economic opportunities from stringent climate policies. Adaptation modeling
    is often blended with geo-engineering in models. Adaptation's success depends
    on regional vulnerabilities and capabilities (e.g., the Netherlands vs. Bangladesh
    regarding sea level rise).
  25: IAMs blur the distinction between direct damages and adaptation costs, and adaptive
    capacity varies significantly across SSPs.
  31: The study highlights the limitations to adaptation due to farm size constraints.
  32: The analysis considers the impact of different epidemiological exposure-response
    functions (Hothaps and ISO:7243:1989 standards) on worker productivity.
  33: Market-related barriers and inertia are often not implemented in macroeconomic
    models, potentially underestimating economic costs; top-down approaches may have
    weak empirical foundations at the national level; static or recursive-dynamic
    CGE models may not fully capture anticipatory adaptation; adequate representation
    of extreme events and variability within countries can improve CGE modelling.
  34: Several CICERO reports are cited, potentially providing further details on specific
    regions and sectors.
  40: There is an increased focus on climate services for solution-support related
    to the European Green Deal and EU Horizon missions.
  48: The paper focuses on the evaluation of climate change impact models for adaptation
    decisions, emphasizing the importance of model validation and the use of global
    sensitivity analysis to improve model transparency and robustness. It aims to
    strengthen stakeholder confidence in model projections and adaptation strategies
    derived from them.
  51: The study emphasizes the importance of incorporating uncertainty in wave setup
    parameters in coastal hazard assessments, as neglecting this uncertainty may invalidate
    conclusions and lead to an overestimation of the effects of other drivers, at
    least for short and mid-term planning periods.
  56: The insights gained from field-based adaptation stress-testing are limited by
    the conditions experienced during the observation period. Model simulations overcome
    this constraint by applying credible climate changes within the virtual worlds
    of system models.
  58: Emphasizes that uncertainty in climate impacts must be embraced rather than
    avoided, suggesting that satisficing investments may be more practical than optimizing.
  68: The described methodology can be applied to reduce uncertainty when evaluating
    the effect of adaptation measures.
  72: Chapters 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 provide more details on specific
    methodologies and applications.
  86: The paper presents a hypothetical extension of a site-based modeling study to
    illustrate how an IRS analysis can be used to estimate regional risk, focusing
    on crop yield shortfall in Finland. The inclusion of adaptation measures in IRS
    analysis is also mentioned.
  100: The diversification of crop rotations can increase the resilience of European
    crop production under climate change. The sequence of crops plays a significant
    role in resource use efficiency.
  106: The authors recommend further developing process-based, dynamic modelling for
    large-scale flood risk analyses, which is increasingly feasible due to improvements
    in computational power and data science.
  108: Knowledge about changes in vulnerability and risk, particularly their drivers
    and driver interactions is scarce. Recent reports by insurers emphasize that floods
    cause tremendous losses, particularly to modern buildings with good thermal insulation
    and innovative building materials.
  111: Local/regional studies can use specific vulnerability scenarios, while large-scale
    assessments depend on shared socioeconomic pathway scenarios for vulnerability
    inputs.
  121: The Climate-fit.City project includes services like heat-health service, emergency
    planning service, and socio-economic impact service. The socio-economic impact
    service provides an assessment of socio-economic impacts by the climate services
    for each demonstration case of Climate-fit.City.
  127: The model is a simplified representation and future research is planned to
    incorporate more realism, including crop yield parameterizations from real-world
    field data and weather indices from observations/forecasts of weather and climate
    variables, and probabilistic forecasts including confidence intervals.
  128: The study suggests that future research should focus on incorporating climate
    change projections (e.g., wetter areas getting wetter, dry areas getting drier)
    into the WII model to better assess the long-term impacts on agriculture. Also
    it shows the difference in income for decisions on buying insurance.
  135: The sophistication of each component of a global flood hazard simulation model
    is contingent on the others.
  140: The modelling approach considers the capacity of food system actors to respond
    and adapt to climate change based on economic drivers and other factors.
  141: The model considers both direct (response to climatic conditions) and indirect
    (response to market movements or policy decisions) adaptation mechanisms.
  142: The model aims to represent interactions of bottom-up adaptation dynamics and
    top-down mitigation policies, operating at multiple scales.
  144: Mitigation and adaptation to climate change do not always co-benefit, e.g.
    widespread adoption of climate mitigation actions such as bioenergy and reforestation
    can impact the land and food systems.
  145: The LandSyMM model can explore the potential of climate adaptation via implementation
    of different scenarios that underpin climate change. These scenarios consider
    economic growth, population demographics, international trade regimes, and dietary
    preferences.
  155: The study focuses on water resource systems at the river basin level, not nationwide
    analysis.
  158: The study focuses on the Jucar basin in Spain, specifically analyzing irrigation
    water demand for agriculture. It translates global SSP narratives into local storytellings
    using fake future news articles to engage local stakeholders.
  168: Increasing exposure of transport networks to severe and frequent extreme hazards
    requires significant investments in higher climate-resilient design standards.
  174: The research agenda aims to allow stakeholders to explicitly trade-off incremental
    changes in robustness with expected policy performance (e.g. cost-effectiveness).
  180: The paper advocates for an interdisciplinary research framework to quantify
    the socioeconomic and environmental implications of adaptation policies related
    to water resource management.
  181: The research is relevant for policymakers who have committed to the good ecological
    status of water bodies, and who need to be aware of trade-offs and distributive
    implications of adaptation policies.
  183: The paper focuses on the private sector's role in adapting to climate change
    and the associated risks and opportunities, particularly concerning transitional
    risks and Scope 3 emissions.
  185: The science-based targets initiative and the European taxonomy on sustainable
    finance are mentioned as tools to help companies comply with the Paris Agreement
    and steer finance towards low-carbon assets.
  189: The page emphasizes the importance of transparency and standardization in GHG
    emissions accounting and reporting for private sector companies. It also highlights
    the need for greater harmonization of practical guidelines for assessing value
    chain-related emissions.
  191: The paper focuses on the role of insurance in climate change adaptation, particularly
    in transferring risk and reducing avoidable damages.
  194: "BI insurance is often considered as an \u201Cannexe\u201D to property insurance,\
    \ and no individual assessment of the BI risk is done."
  196: Credit insurers can contribute to climate change adaptation by improving risk
    assessment, supporting insured parties in risk mitigation, and adapting insurance
    terms following disasters.
  209: The EU Adaptation Strategy emphasizes the need to 'support better-informed
    decision making on climate adaptation at multiple governance levels'. The new
    Adaptation Strategy of the EU, presented in March 2021, iterated the concept.
  210: Promoting a systematic survey of existing quantitative evidence on costs and
    effectiveness of adaptation; developing systematic guidance tools and case studies
    ('rapid and light touch' analyses).
  212: Adaptation feasibility is determined by technical and physical possibilities,
    local capacities, governance, and preference, which determine the hard and soft
    limits of adaptation.
  222: The impact chains methodology involves identifying factors and processes associated
    with hazard, vulnerability, and exposure. The approach integrates local data and
    knowledge.
  223: Impact chains are built around current climate risks and then extended through
    the identification of factors related to a potential future situation considering
    future climate projections, urbanization, and aging populations.
