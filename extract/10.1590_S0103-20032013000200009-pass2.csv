1,Agriculture,Irrigation,Brazil,A1B,Comparison of land values,MonetaryBenefits,Economic,Need,%,21.6,5.8,NA,NA,NA,NA,Page 12,"The quantification reflects the increase in land value for irrigated farms compared to non-irrigated farms. Specifically, there is an expected increase of 21.6% in 2020 and 2050, and 20.5% in 2080 due to irrigation, with a standard deviation of 5.8 for irrigated land values. Uncertainty quantiles are not provided in this excerpt."
