Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme weather events, increased total rainfall, increases in mean average temperature,
    and increases in mean minimum temperatures.
  2: "Climate change impacts (heavy rains, flooding, droughts, rising sea levels,\
    \ El Ni\xF1o/La Ni\xF1a), natural disasters (tsunami, floods, droughts, windstorms),\
    \ greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, improper land use."
  4: Climatic factors (rainfall, rainfall intensity, average temperature, min/max
    temperatures) and non-climatic factors (agricultural land use, number of agricultural
    households).
  5: Climatic factors (lnAverT, lnMinT, lnMaxT, lnRf, lnRfd are likely temperature
    and rainfall variables) and non-climatic factors (lnA likely represents technology,
    lnL likely represents labor, and lnCF is present but undefined in this page).
  6: Changes in mean average temperature, total rainfall, rainfall intensification,
    mean minimum temperature, mean maximum temperature, agricultural land use, agricultural
    households
  7: Temperature increases (mean average, mean maximum, mean minimum), rainfall intensification,
    rainfall variability, decreases in total rainfall.
  8: Climate change, extreme events, weather variability, agricultural production
    (as a key factor for global warming)
  10: The table includes variables like 'lnAverT', 'lnMinT', 'lnMaxT', 'lnRf', and
    'lnRfd', which likely represent the natural logarithms of average temperature,
    minimum temperature, maximum temperature, rainfall, and rainfall duration respectively,
    and 'lne' might be energy use.
Highlights:
  1: Extreme weather events have a negative impact on the agricultural economy, increased
    total rainfall has a positive association with the agricultural economy, and increases
    in mean average and mean minimum temperatures will reduce the variability of agricultural
    growth.
  2: Climate change has a negative effect on economic growth, affecting livelihoods
    and the environment, with significant impacts on Thailand's agricultural sector
    and export performance.
  5: The study examines the relationship between climatic and non-climatic factors
    and economic value in the agricultural sector using an ARDL-ECM framework.
  6: Total rainfall and the number of agricultural households positively affect the
    agricultural economy, while mean minimum temperature, mean maximum temperature,
    and rainfall intensity have a negative effect in the long run.
  7: Extreme climate events (increased max/min temperatures, rainfall intensification)
    negatively affect the agricultural economy in Thailand. Increased total rainfall
    can mitigate these negative impacts. Agricultural households with better access
    to water resources can contribute to raising agricultural revenue.
  10: The p-values for the tests on 'lnY', 'lnAverT', 'lnMinT', 'lnMaxT', 'lnRf',
    'lnRfd' and 'lne' indicate that these variables are likely integrated of order
    one (I(1)) based on the null hypothesis rejection with p < 0.001, following differencing,
    suggesting they are stationary in first differences.
  11: The ARDL bounds tests indicate cointegration for both lnY and lne^2 (p < 0.001).
Methodology:
  1: Panel data analysis consisting of unit root tests, autoregressive distributed
    lag (ARDL) bounds for analyzing cointegration, and pool mean group (PMG) estimation
    for detecting long-run and short-run effects. Applicable to understanding the
    impact of climate change on Thailand's agricultural economy.
  2: Panel data analysis to estimate the impact of climate and weather variability
    on the economic growth of the agricultural sector in Thailand using data from
    76 provinces from 1995 to 2019.
  4: Panel cointegration using an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds cointegration
    analysis, Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimation.
  5: The analysis uses an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach
    and an Error Correction Model (ECM). The ARDL model is suitable when variables
    are integrated of different orders (I(0) or I(1)). The unit root tests (LLC, IPS,
    ADF-Fisher, PP-Fisher) are used to determine the order of integration of the variables.
    The Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Schwarz information criterion (SIC)
    are used to select lag lengths. The F-statistic or Wald coefficient test is used
    to test for cointegration (long-run relationship) between variables. The ECM is
    used to capture short-run dynamics and the speed of adjustment to equilibrium.
  6: Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach with a general-to-specific
    cointegration structure and Panel Mean Group (PMG) estimation based on the ARDL
    structure using the Cobb-Douglas function. The PMG assumes long-run coefficients
    are homogeneous across provinces, while short-run coefficients are heterogeneous.
  7: ARDL-PMG estimation with a Cobb-Douglas structure is used to analyze the impacts
    of climatic and non-climatic factors on the agricultural economy in Thailand.
    The model examines both long-run equilibrium and short-run relationships.
  8: Empirical study providing an indirect analysis of the impact of climate and weather
    variability on the agricultural economy
  10: Panel unit root tests (LLC, IPS, ADF-Fisher, PP-Fisher) are used to determine
    the order of integration (I(0) or I(1)) of the variables, which is a necessary
    step before conducting panel data analysis. These tests are designed to determine
    if time series data have a unit root and are non-stationary (I(1)), or if they
    are stationary (I(0)).
  11: The analysis uses Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds tests. It refers
    to Pesaran et al. (2001) for the bounds test methodology.
More Notes:
  1: The study also identifies that productivity of agricultural households and water
    resources increases agricultural revenue and reduces its variability for long-term
    development.
  2: The study focuses on the agricultural sector and aims to assess the impact of
    climate change on value-added rather than just productivity; it also includes
    both climatic and non-climatic variables.
  5: The variables lnAverT, lnMinT, lnMaxT, lnRf, and lnRfd are assumed to be related
    to climate (likely temperature and rainfall). The variable lnA is assumed to represent
    technology and lnL is assumed to represent labor. The variables must be integrated
    of order zero or one (I(0) or I(1)).
  6: "The study focuses on the agricultural sector in Thailand. Rainfed agriculture\
    \ accounts for approximately 78 percent of the country\u2019s total arable land."
  7: The study focuses specifically on the agricultural sector in Thailand. Findings
    might not be generalizable to other sectors or countries without similar climatic
    and economic conditions.
  8: Highlights the need for raising awareness, appropriate agricultural production
    supervision and control measures, and transferring responsibility for environmental
    impacts to stakeholders in the agricultural supply chain.
  10: The variables 'lnA', 'lnL' are also tested, and appear to refer to productivity
    and labor.

    by US$2.5 billion due to the 2011 flood; headline inflation reached 3.9% in 2011;
    2015-2016 drought caused US$468.72 million in agricultural damage; US$5.77 billion
    damage to agriculture due to droughts, floods, and windstorms from 1989 to 2012.

  5: "The page describes the ARDL bounds testing approach, but doesn't provide actual\
    \ quantitative estimates. The regressions use coefficients \u03B2 to quantify\
    \ the relationship between variables."
  6: A one percent increase in the number of agricultural households will increase
    the agricultural economy by 0.335 percent. A one percent increase in total rainfall
    will increase the agricultural economy by 2.491 percent. A one percent increase
    in the mean minimum temperature, mean maximum temperature, and rainfall intensity
    will reduce the agricultural economy by 6.223 percent, 6.238 percent, and 0.944
    percent, respectively.
