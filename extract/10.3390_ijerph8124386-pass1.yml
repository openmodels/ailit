Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on cholera incidence.
  2: Increased temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns as a result of climate
    change.
  3: Future climate change in East Africa will likely lead to increased precipitation
    in winter months, increased intensity of rain in shorter periods, and drought
    in other periods.
  4: Climate change impacts on the prevalence of cholera in Tanzania.
  5: Rainfall and temperature are linked to cholera cases.
  6: Climate change impact on diarrheal disease and cholera incidence, rainfall patterns.
  9: Climate change leading to increased risk of cholera incidence.
  10: Climate change leading to increased cholera cases.
  11: Climate change (temperature increase and drought season), leading to increased
    cholera cases.
  12: "Climate change (specifically, 1\xB0C and 2\xB0C increases in temperature)."
  13: "Climate change (specifically, 1\xB0C and 2\xB0C warming scenarios), Insufficient\
    \ preventive adaptation measures (e.g., water and sanitation infrastructure),\
    \ Socioeconomic factors"

Highlights:
  1: The study focuses on the costs associated with climate change exacerbating cholera
    outbreaks in Tanzania.
  2: Climate change could lead to cholera costs in Tanzania ranging from 0.32 to 1.4%
    of GDP by 2030.
  3: The effective and timely adaptation measures are crucial to reduce the magnitude
    of climate change-related health impacts over the next few decades.
  4: Estimates the total costs of cholera attributable to climate change, including
    the costs of reactive adaptation, productivity losses, and lost lives.
  5: Cholera cases exhibit a seasonal pattern, with lower cases coinciding with lower
    minimum/maximum temperatures and lower rainfall between June and October in Tanzania.  The
    2004 Cholera cases had a larger peak than the other years studied.
  6: No relevant information
  9: 'Preventive adaptation measures (hygiene, water, and sanitation) are assumed
    to be implemented in line with socioeconomic development and are not included
    in the total estimates of adaptation costs in this study. Reactive adaptation
    measures will be needed in terms of cholera cases continuing to be treated after
    preventive adaptation measures have been put in place, and costs of residual damages
    are included. '
  10: The paper estimates the additional costs of reactive adaptation measures and
    productivity losses resulting from climate change-induced cholera.
  11: Cholera cases in Tanzania are positively correlated with temperature. A 1 degree
    Celsius increase in temperature increases the relative risk of cholera cases by
    15-29%. The cost of cholera deaths attributable to climate change is calculated
    using a VOSL of USD 32,958. The GDP share of the total cost of cholera attributable
    to climate change by 2030 is calculated.
  12: "A 2\xB0C temperature increase by 2030 could lead to an additional 245,573 cholera\
    \ cases and 7,809 deaths. Reactive adaptation costs could range from USD 11.7\
    \ million to USD 24 million under a pessimistic scenario with a 2\xB0C increase.\
    \ A 44-47% cost reduction can be achieved if the temperature increase is limited."
  13: The study estimates the annual costs of cholera attributable to climate change
    in Tanzania by 2030. A large share of the costs (90 percent) is related to loss
    of lives. The estimates suggest that cholera alone could cost Tanzania up to 0.6%
    of GDP under certain climate change scenarios.
  14: Climate change-induced cholera increases in Tanzania could cost 0.03-0.12% of
    GDP by 2030 in reactive costs alone.
  15: Loss of lives accounts for 90 percent of total costs of cholera attributable
    to climate change.
  16: The cost estimates are substantial and higher than current budgets allocated
    for diarrheal diseases, necessitating budgetary increases.
  21: Real GDP per capita and water cover are found to have a statistically significant
    negative relationship with cholera deaths.
Methodology:
  1: The paper uses a case study approach focused on Tanzania.
  2: Integrates historical data on temperature and rainfall with the burden of disease
    from cholera in Tanzania, controlling for socioeconomic factors. Projects the
    number and costs of additional cholera cases attributable to climate change by
    2030 in Tanzania.
  3: The WHO has made projections based on case studies from Peru and Fiji, incorporating
    socio-economic development and water and sanitation coverage into their predictions.
  4: Analysis draws on primary data sources to estimate the relationship between climate
    variables and cholera, using historical data from Tanzania and projecting future
    disease burden by 2030.
  5: Statistical analysis of cholera cases, rainfall, and temperature at country and
    regional levels. A health impact assessment is proposed, based on climate change
    predictions, population growth and economic development.
  6: Baseline scenario (C0) for 2030 uses Mathers and Loncar [35] projections, including
    diarrheal disease estimates.  These estimates are based on correlations between
    economic growth and mortality trends. Downscaling of regional diarrheal disease
    projections to the country level using projected total deaths from diarrheal diseases.
    Cholera deaths are estimated based on proportion of cholera deaths relative to
    diarrheal deaths in Tanzania from WHO data.  Cholera cases are then estimated
    using a case fatality rate (CFR).
  9: Regression models are used to assess the impact of climate variables and socioeconomic
    factors on cholera incidence. Models are chosen based on significance of regressors
    and goodness-of-fit criteria (log-likelihood, Wald chi-squared, Akaike and Bayesian
    information criteria).
  10: Reactive adaptation costs are calculated by multiplying the number of climate
    change-attributable cholera cases by the unit cost per case treated; Productivity
    losses are calculated from daily wages multiplied by days out of work; VOSL is
    adjusted for Tanzania using the ratio of real per capita GDP relative to the US,
    taking purchasing power into account.
  11: Correlation and regression analysis of cholera cases with climate variables
    (temperature, rainfall, drought season). Cost estimation based on VOSL and projected
    cholera deaths. GDP share calculated based on GDP projections for annual GDP growth
    rates for Sub-Saharan Africa. Analysis dealt with seasonality via introduction
    of a dummy variable indicating the period of less or more rainfall.
  12: The study uses annual and monthly datasets to compute cases and deaths attributable
    to climate change for 2030, assuming CFR from WHO. Projections are estimated for
    lower and upper boundaries based on different assumptions about the relative risk
    increase with temperature.
  13: The study links cases of cholera to environmental and socioeconomic factors
    to predict climate change impacts to cholera in Tanzania and assesses the related
    costs. The study incorporates a future baseline disease burden, implying a reduction
    in incidence rates due to economic growth and health sector developments. Applicable
    to Tanzania by 2030.
  14: Econometric analyses using long-term datasets; cost estimates based on unpublished
    data from the Tanzanian Ministry of Health.
  15: Cost calculations considered the value of statistical life (VOSL), adjusted
    for GDP.
  16: The study assesses the costs of adaptation in the health sector at the national
    level in Tanzania, taking into account expected future economic development including
    a strengthening of the health system.
  21: Negative binomial regression is used to model the relationship between cholera
    deaths (dependent variable) and other factors. Table A3 uses annual data for cholera
    deaths and income, while Table A4 uses annual data for cholera deaths and water
    cover. Significance levels are noted (*** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.10).
More Notes:
  1: The paper was published in 2011, so the data and methodologies might be somewhat
    outdated. The title suggests a focus on costs rather than broader macroeconomic
    effects, but cholera incidence could have implications for public health expenditure
    and labor productivity, thus affecting fiscal and macroeconomic outcomes.
  2: The study focuses on the health sector implications of climate change and aims
    to inform national and international debates on financing and planning adaptation.
  5: The analysis acknowledges the limited reliability of the econometric analysis
    due to the reduced number of observations (7 years) in the datasets.
  6: The rainfall seasonality data shows the pattern of rainfall in Tanzania, which
    is related to climate risks.  The paper uses diarrheal diseases and cholera as
    example health impacts that could be affected by climate.
  9: The study focuses on Tanzania and the Water Sector Development Programme (WSDP)
    as an example of structural development in the water sector. A time-trend variable
    is integrated into the model to capture the effect of other socioeconomic variables
    that potentially influence cholera cases but are absent from the dataset.
  10: The paper assumes that even unemployed individuals contribute to economic activity
    and uses an agricultural worker's wage as a proxy for their productivity; For
    child cholera cases, the productivity loss includes time taken off work by an
    adult to care for the child.
  11: "The costs of preventive measures are not included in the calculations of total\
    \ costs of cholera attributable to climate change, since these cost measures are\
    \ assumed to be implemented in line with Tanzania\u2019s national development\
    \ objectives. The study estimates costs of reactive adaptation and impacts remaining\
    \ after preventative adaptation."
  12: The study focuses solely on the economic costs of cholera as an effect of climate
    change, not on other macroeconomic or fiscal impacts more broadly.
  13: Cost estimates assume preventive adaptation measures are introduced and Tanzania
    meets its national goals of universal water and sanitation coverage by 2025. The
    full health costs of climate change would be much larger if other health variables
    (e.g., diarrhea, typhoid, malnutrition, food-borne and vector-borne diseases)
    were accounted for.
  14: Preventive measures were assumed to be implemented along with general socio-economic
    development, and were thus not included in the cost estimates.
  15: The distributional impacts of adaptation measures were not considered.
  16: The study emphasizes the importance of quantifying the burden of disease attributable
    to climate change at national and local levels due to varying vulnerabilities.
    It also calls for refining national costs of preventative and reactive adaptation
    measures in the health sector.

    the range of 0.32 to 1.4 percent of GDP in Tanzania 2030 for a 1 and 2 degree
    increase in temperatures, respectively. A 1 degree Celsius temperature increase
    leads to an initial relative risk of cholera increase by 15 to 29 percent.
  3: The World Health Organization (WHO) has projected an average 5 percent increase
    in the relative number of diarrheal incidences for 2030 in Sub-Saharan Africa.

  9: Household-based chlorination is found to be the most cost-effective intervention,
    with an annual cost of US $59 per DALY averted (from a referenced study, not this
    paper's original result).
  10: Cost of managing a cholera patient (treatment, bed, personnel, outpatient surveillance)
    is US$98 per case; Weighted average daily wage is used to calculate productivity
    loss; VOSL for Tanzania is calculated based on US VOSL of USD 4 million, adjusted
    for real per capita GDP and purchasing power parity.
  11: 'Value of Statistical Life (VOSL) for Tanzania: USD 32,958. Risk ratio: An increase
    in temperature equal to 1 degree Celsius would increase the relative risk for
    cholera cases in Tanzania by 29 percent (monthly data) or 15 percent (annual data).
    Linear correlation between cholera cases and total rainfall was not significant.'

    \ deaths, DALYs, and additional DALYs attributable to climate change in 2030 under\
    \ different temperature increase scenarios (1\xB0C and 2\xB0C). Annual costs of\

    \ cases in 2030 ranging from USD 5.5 million to USD 24 million, depending on the\
    \ temperature increase and scenario (optimistic vs. pessimistic)."
  13: "Annual costs of cholera attributable to climate change by 2030 in Tanzania\
    \ under 1\xB0C and 2\xB0C warming scenarios, including costs of reactive measures,\
    \ productivity losses, loss of lives, total costs, and total cost as a percentage\
    \ of GDP. Productivity losses account for approximately 11-13% of the total cost\
    \ of illness. The cost of illness (reactive measures + productivity losses) accounts\
    \ for 0.03 to 0.13 percent of GDP. Upper bound estimate for the 1\xB0C scenario\
    \ and lower bound estimate for the 2\xB0C scenario lie at around 0.6 percent of\
    \ GDP."
  14: 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature leads to 0.05 to 0.1 percentage point
    increase in cholera incidence for Tanzania; reactive costs of additional cholera
    cases could be 0.03-0.12% share of GDP by 2030.
  15: Cholera health cost of increased temperatures of 1 to 2 degrees Celsius by 2030
    will be in the range of 0.03 to 0.12 percent of GDP for treatment costs alone.
  16: Costs may be as much as 1.4 percent of GDP by 2030 for the upper boundary. Budgetary
    increases around 0.75 percent may be necessary
  21: Real GDP per capita has a statistically significant negative coefficient (-0.0028)
    on cholera deaths, indicating that higher real GDP per capita is associated with
    lower cholera deaths. Water cover has a statistically significant negative coefficient
    (-12.5607) on cholera deaths, indicating that increased water cover is associated
    with lower cholera deaths.
