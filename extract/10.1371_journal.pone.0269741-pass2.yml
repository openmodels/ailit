Highlights:
  1: SLR zones developed faster and continue to have higher structure density than
    non-coastal, urban, and inland areas. Density levels in historically less-developed
    coastal areas are now quickly converging on early settled SLR zones, many of which
    have reached building saturation.
  2: First fine-scale nationwide analysis of the exposure of the coastal built environment
    to hazards over the twentieth century. Establishes a robust link between coastal
    conditions, specifically hurricane activity, and the long-term spatial development
    of urban areas.
  3: The study investigates critical land transitions that inform the measurement
    of exposure of the built environment over the past century to sea level rise.
  4: Provides unique opportunities for historical analysis of residential land use,
    housing markets and the built structure. Foremost of interest is information about
    residential, commercial and industrial land use related to built structures, building
    area and the construction year.
  5: Demonstrates that using year built data can provide insight into post-hurricane
    rebuild activities.
  6: The analysis assesses how transitional units developed over time in relation
    to exposure to sea level rise and hurricanes, using contemporary MSA boundaries
    to account for urbanization.
  7: Developed area and housing stock dramatically increased along the coastline over
    the past century, particularly between 1950 and 2000. SLR zones have higher structure
    density and have densified and expanded at higher rates than inland coastal areas
    and MSAs.
  8: The image depicts significant urban expansion and increased density in coastal
    areas over more than a century, highlighting the effects of coastal urbanization.
  9: SLR zones and coastal MSAs are denser, more developed, and consistently have
    higher rates of expansion than MSAs across the country as a whole.
  10: The Pacific U.S. had high rates of growth after 1950, converging to the already
    developed Northeast in built environment characteristics. The West South Central
    remains lower in density of structures and percent of SLR zone developed, but
    the Pacific division overtook New England in structure density within developed
    land yet remains low in percent of SLR zone developed.
  11: Coastlines, particularly in Florida and the South Atlantic division, exhibit
    high exposure to sea level rise. The Western Gulf coastline remains less developed
    than the Northeast, Pacific, and Southeast but is a potential hotspot for new
    building and land-use transitions.
  12: Absolute exposure to sea level rise increased across all divisions, even as
    relative exposure remained steady or decreased. Areas at highest risk of hurricanes,
    the South Atlantic, have higher exposure across both sea level rise and hurricane
    risk measures, suggesting more development in these areas. Hurricane activity
    tends to be associated with more compact and more dense building patterns.
  13: MSAs affected by hurricanes are denser and more developed than those not affected
    by hurricanes. They found that cumulative hurricane events are correlated with
    differences in building between SLR zones and interior areas within MSAs.
  14: Hurricane-prone environments may produce more dense, compact urban landscapes.
  15: Coastal regions generally follow a trend of expansion followed by densification,
    with no regions currently showing increasing expansion, pointing to growing densification
    and increased built environment exposure along the coast. There is increasing
    convergence of density and expansion characteristics of SLR zones across regions.
  16: Areas at risk of hurricane impacts are more highly developed than those that
    are not at risk; U.S. coastlines look different after even one hurricane hit,
    and even more different after multiple hits; Hurricane disasters affect the physical
    structure of the built environment in hurricane-prone areas, with increased development
    intensity and building sizes along the coast; Coastal hazards are associated with
    increases in exposure, but the densified nature of development will constrain
    future adaptation efforts.
  17: Building age is an indicator of vulnerability due to outdated building codes
    and construction practices. Identifies metropolitan areas and neighborhoods vulnerable
    to coastal hazards. Density and development patterns do not completely illustrate
    exposure; building condition and adaptation are also important.
  18: Coastal communities have denser and more intensely developed built environments
    than inland areas, leading to high exposure regardless of the probability of natural
    hazards. There is a need to avoid 'business as usual' coastal development scenarios
    and to promote sustainable development, building policies, and coastal retreat
    after disaster.
  19: Built environment exposure to sea level rise and hurricanes is analyzed using
    ZTRAX data and regression analysis. Data incompleteness is addressed by excluding
    regions with significant missing data.
  20: Several papers focus on the impact of climate change and sea level rise on coastal
    communities and infrastructure, including housing and real estate.
Methodology:
  1: Leveraging new historical settlement layers from the Historical Settlement Data
    Compilation for the U.S. (HISDAC-US) to examine building patterns within and between
    the SLR zones of the conterminous United States since the early twentieth century.
  2: "Analysis of built-up property records across coastal regions of the U.S. from\
    \ pre-1900 to 2015 using gridded historical settlement data layers derived from\
    \ Zillow\u2019s ZTRAX database and the Historical Settlement Data Compilation\
    \ of the United States. Overlaid with sea level rise zones from NOAA."
  3: The study investigates trends of urban expansion into coastal areas at risk of
    sea level rise impacts, comparing them to inland areas. It uses measures including
    built-up property density, coastal land development, and the age of buildings.
    The data used are from Zillow's ZTRAX dataset and historical settlement layers
    in HISDAC-US. The analysis covers the conterminous United States and uses Census
    Divisions and core-based statistical areas.
  4: "Using the ZTRAX database, a new settlement data product covering the time period\
    \ 1810\u20132010 (i.e., the HISDAC-US) was created. Gridded data layers representing\
    \ built-up intensity, year of first settlement, number of built property locations,\
    \ and accompanying uncertainty were produced at 250-meter spatial resolution and\
    \ 5-year temporal resolution. Data was resampled to 50-meter resolution to better\
    \ use it with sea level rise zones."
  5: "Uses NOAA Sea Level Rise dataset to determine boundaries of 3 feet and 6 feet\
    \ zones. Analyzes settlement patterns in SLR zones using Metropolitan and Micropolitan\
    \ Statistical Areas (MSAs) with consistent 2010 boundaries. Only best quality\
    \ data used, with grid cell-level year built missingness < 5% (except for the\
    \ exception for rebuilds post hurricane). Missingness assessed using TPixMiss\
    \ data layer in HISDAC\u2013US [42]."
  6: The study uses Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) as the
    unit of analysis. Hurricane impacts are determined by intersecting MSAs with hurricane
    eye landfalls from the HURDAT2 database (1900-2015), considering MSAs within 20
    km of a landfall as affected. Protected areas and wetlands are excluded from the
    SLR zones before development metrics are calculated. Zonal statistics are used
    to determine the total number of structures, built interior area, and built grid
    cells within SLR zones and MSAs in five-year increments from 1900-2015.
  7: The study uses settlement layers to analyze building trends along U.S. coastlines,
    measuring expansion and densification of built-up areas over time using grid cells.
  9: The analysis uses the Built-Up Properties Layer (BUPL) data from HISDAC to measure
    urban development. Expansion and densification were calculated over 10-year time
    increments.
  10: Analysis based on structure density (structures per developed grid cell), densification
    (structures added relative to expansion), proportion of the SLR zone developed,
    and expansion (increase in developed grid cells) calculated over 10-year increments.
    Coastal MSAs are aggregated to Census Divisions.
  11: Quantifies the absolute and relative exposure of MSAs to SLR by comparing the
    total number of buildings to the percentage of buildings inside SLR zones.
  12: Regression analysis and fixed effect panel regression models are used to examine
    building patterns in SLR zones vs. interior areas based on environmental context,
    and to predict 2015 building attributes. A within-metropolitan analysis of historical
    building patterns and hurricane trends is performed by dividing coastal MSAs into
    areas inside and outside of the 6-foot SLR zone and using 5-year time steps from
    1900 to 2015.
  13: The study uses regressions with census division fixed effects to analyze the
    impact of sea level rise and hurricanes on building characteristics in MSA zones.
    The data covers the period from 1900-2015, with dependent variables measured in
    2015. Hurricane severity is defined based on average max wind speeds or number
    of storm hits since 1900.
  14: Panel regression analysis from 1900-2015 is used to examine the relationship
    between sea-level rise, hurricanes, and the built environment. Standard errors
    are clustered at the MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area) scale. Fixed effects
    include individual year, MSA, and individual year x census division.
  15: Analysis of coastal settlements reveals patterns of expansion (lateral growth)
    and densification (addition of structures). Results applicable to understanding
    historical development and projecting future trends in coastal exposure.
  16: The study identifies increasing dense SLR zones in areas affected by hurricanes
    in recent decades.
  17: Uses HISDAC-US data to understand the development and age of neighborhoods,
    relating building age to building codes and practices.
  18: The analysis uses settlement data to understand the evolution of exposure along
    the coast.
  19: The study uses ZTRAX data, comparing the number of structures across datasets.
    They perform regression analysis of storm hits. The spatial unit of analysis includes
    Metro- and Micro-Statistical Areas (MSA). They exclude areas with significant
    data incompleteness, specifically grid cells with missing year built information.
  20: Various modeling and statistical approaches are employed, including analysis
    of historical settlement data and climate change projections.
More Notes:
  2: Focuses on how communities build and where they build, and argues that effective
    decisions on these fronts require a fact base rooted in the best available data
    on both hazards and the built environment.  The research contends with the historical
    forces that have shaped our cities, and specifically incorporate the role of human-hazard
    interactions as a central feature of that research.
  3: The figure and data are available through open licenses for U.S. government datasets
    or a CC0 license.
  4: ZTRAX data has limitations related to data quality including spatial, temporal
    and thematic uncertainties. Can have commission and omission errors.
  5: Data quality issues with ZTRAX database, particularly in Louisiana.  Excluding
    low quality data leads to a more conservative but reliable estimate of growth
    in the Southeast.  Uses MSAs to aggregate results to representative areas along
    the coast.
  7: Densification (number of structures added per developed grid cell) was greater
    than one after 1980.
  9: The paper examines expansion (aerial growth of developed land) and structure
    density (addition of structures to already developed areas) as key aspects of
    urban development in relation to SLR.
  10: The study uses coastal MSAs aggregated to Census Divisions for analysis of development
    trends.
  11: Distinguishes between densification- and sprawl-based development trajectories
    related to coastal development.
  12: The South Atlantic is a key region of focus due to high exposure and specific
    building trends. The analysis attempts to determine whether building patterns
    reflect adaptation to cyclonic activity.
  13: The analysis focuses on metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and aims to identify
    distinctive building patterns in hurricane-prone environments, considering the
    differences between SLR zones and the remainder of the metro area.
  14: The interaction term (SLRZ x Cumulative storms) primarily comes from within-MSA
    differences over time.
  15: Densification implies potentially decreasing built environment vulnerability
    through less land expansion into hazardous areas and more modern building codes.
    The Southeastern coastline is almost at 50% built-up proportion in the SLR zone,
    and the Pacific even exceeds the coastal density in New England.
  17: The paper advocates for policies and incentives that prioritize adaptation in
    coastal communities, discussing options like structural alterations, nature-based
    approaches, and retreat from the coastline.
  18: "The study points to saturation along many parts of the coastline, where expansion\
    \ has decreased and structure addition has remained steady, resulting in high-density\
    \ built environments. The United States\u2019 aging infrastructure, older buildings,\
    \ and increasing density can lead to extremely exposed and vulnerable coastlines\
    \ in the future. Building size and density has tended to increase after hurricanes\
    \ hit an area, meaning that coastal exposure to hazards followed compounding trajectories."

    coastal MSAs and 17.2% of the built-up properties recorded in ZTRAX in coastal
    MSAs.
  6: The analysis calculates the proportion of grid cells developed (Built Area Proportion
    - BAP) by dividing the number of built grid cells by the total number of grid

    developed land by dividing the number of structures by the total number of developed
    grid cells.
  7: 446% increase in structures and a 220% increase in developed land area along
    the US coastline between 1950 and 2000.
  9: The analysis provides quantitative information about changes in density, densification,
    percentage of developed land, and expansion of developed area within different
    zones (SLR, Coastal MSAs, and all CONUS MSAs) over time (1900-2010), including
    showing differences in their trends.

  12: The South Atlantic division has the highest percentage of total MSA structures
    in the SLR zone. Since about 1970, the percentage of total MSA structures in the
    SLR has dropped in the South Atlantic because of increasing addition of structures
    in inland areas.
  13: The analysis uses coefficient estimates from regressions to quantify the relationship
    between hurricane severity/sea level rise and building characteristics (share
    of built-up land, structure density, total structures).
  14: Hurricane activity is associated with fewer built structures among hurricane-hit
    locations.
  15: Coastal building transitioned from expansion to densification from roughly 1980
    on.

    areas like Miami, New York, Boston, Houston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Notes
    higher rates of structure additions in the South Atlantic and Florida.
  17: Shows the percent of structures older than 1975 across MSAs.
  18: The rate of exposure growth has slowed across all divisions, possibly due to
    saturation of coastal areas and decreasing availability of developable land.
