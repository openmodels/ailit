Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea level rise (SLR) and damaging flood events, climate change, oceanic thermal
    expansion, and melting of ice sheets.
  2: Sea level rise and hurricanes.
  3: Sea level rise, specifically focusing on 3 feet/0.91 meters and 6 feet/1.83 meters
    scenarios.
  10: Exposure to sea level rise and hurricanes.
  14: Sea-level rise and hurricanes (cumulative storm hits).
  15: Development along US coastlines, particularly expansion and densification of
    settlements in SLR zones.
  18: Coastal communities experiencing denser and more intensely developed built environments
    leading to high exposure to natural hazards like sea-level rise and hurricanes.
Highlights:
  1: SLR zones developed faster and continue to have higher structure density than
    non-coastal, urban, and inland areas; Density levels in historically less-developed
    coastal areas are now quickly converging on early settled SLR zones; Suggests
    adaptation policies targeting existing buildings and developed areas are likely
    to grow in importance.
  2: First fine-scale nationwide analysis of the exposure of the coastal built environment
    to hazards over the twentieth century.
  3: Analysis focuses on the exposure of the built environment over the past century
    to sea level rise by assessing critical land transitions in coastal areas.
  10: The Pacific U.S. experienced high rates of growth after 1950, converging to
    the built environment characteristics of the Northeast; The West South Central
    remains lower in density of structures and percentage of SLR zone developed; The
    Pacific division overtook New England in structure density within developed land.
  14: Sea-level rise zones tend to have a higher share of built-up land. Cumulative
    storm hits are associated with an increase in the share of built-up land. The
    impact of storms on the built-up share of land is concentrated in the SLR zones.
    Hurricane activity is associated with fewer structures in the more restrictive
    sample (hurricane-hit locations). Hurricane-prone environments may produce more
    dense, compact urban landscapes.
  15: Coastal building tends to expand with low-density construction early in development
    but has transitioned to densification from roughly 1980 on; Regardless of the
    cause of growing densification along coastlines, this trend leads to increasing
    exposure through added structures and increased square footage within SLR zones
    and It implies possibly decreasing built environment vulnerability through less
    land expansion into hazardous areas and more modern building codes.
  18: Critical need for adaptation in saturated and dense coastal communities; Importance
    of retrofitting and protecting existing structures in densely developed areas.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of historical settlement data (HISDAC-US) to examine building patterns
    within and between the SLR zones of the conterminous United States since the early
    twentieth century.
  2: "Analysis of built-up property records across coastal regions of the U.S. from\
    \ pre-1900 to 2015, overlaid with sea level rise zones from NOAA, and using gridded\
    \ historical settlement data layers derived from Zillow\u2019s ZTRAX database\
    \ and the Historical Settlement Data Compilation of the United States (HISDAC-US)."
  3: Investigates trends of urban expansion into coastal areas at risk of sea level
    rise and compares them with inland areas using Census Divisions and core-based
    statistical areas. Uses Zillow's ZTRAX dataset and historical settlement layers
    in HISDAC-US to analyze housing transactions, home values, and property-related
    information.
  10: Analysis of structure density, densification, proportion developed within the
    sea level rise (SLR) zone, and expansion of developed grid cells over time, broken
    down by US Census Divisions, calculated over 10-year increments between 1900 and
    2000.
  14: Panel regression analysis from 1900-2015 using MSA-level data with fixed effects
    (year, MSA, year x census division). Standard errors are clustered at the MSA
    level.
More Notes:
  2: The study examines long-term changes in density and expansion across areas most
    likely to be impacted by coastal hazards, using NOAA-defined SLR zones, and explores
    how hurricane exposure relates to historical development.
  3: The study uses publicly available datasets (U.S. government datasets and CC0
    licensed data).
  10: The analysis focuses on historical coastal development trends in the U.S. and
    does not directly quantify macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes of climate change
    or adaptation costs and benefits.
  14: The analysis focuses on the relationship between coastal hazards and the built
    environment, not directly on macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes. The negative
    effect of hurricane activity on structure count is not statistically significant
    in the main sample.
  18: Geographic differences in coastlines play a role in shaping built environments;
    Increasing biophysical exposure and aging infrastructure contribute to vulnerability.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: U.S. property at risk of coastal hazards and sea level rise (SLR).
  2: Exposure to sea level rise and hurricanes puts $1.07 trillion dollars worth of
    national wetlands at risk of disruptive flooding by 2100.
  3: Exposure of the built environment to sea level rise.
  10: No relevant information
  14: Impacts on the built environment, specifically share of built-up land, structure
    density, and total structures.
  15: Exposure to sea-level rise and hurricanes due to increasing development in coastal
    zones.
Quantitative material:
  1: Current estimates of U.S. property at risk are evaluated at over a trillion U.S.
    dollars.
  2: $1.07 trillion dollars worth of national wetlands are at risk.
  3: Uses spatial data on built-up property density, coastal land development, and
    building age within sea level rise zones. HISDAC-US provides data on year the
    first structure was built in an area.
  10: Presents graphs of structure density, densification, proportion of SLR zone
    developed, and expansion, by US Census division from 1900-2000.
  14: Regression coefficients are provided showing the relationship between sea-level
    rise zone, cumulative storms, their interaction, and various measures of the built
    environment (share of built-up land, structure density, total structures). R-squared
    values indicate the goodness of fit for each regression model.
