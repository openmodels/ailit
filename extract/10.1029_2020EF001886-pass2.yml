Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change and population growth are increasing the frequency, severity,
    and spatial extent of heat stress events in the US.
  7: Climate change (represented by RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios) and population change,
    along with their interaction.
  11: Climate change and population changes
  12: Increase in the risk of prolonged heat stress (HS) events primarily due to global-mean
    warming and population growth.
Highlights:
  1: Heat stress risk is projected to more than double in certain areas of the US,
    with significant increases in densely populated regions.
  5: No relevant information
  7: Heat stress is projected to increase significantly under both RCP8.5 and RCP4.5
    scenarios. The relative impact of climate change is examined in a framework that
    considers the non-linearity of each effect.
  11: The risk of potential impact (PI) of heat stress (HS) events is likely to increase
    significantly in the future, particularly under the RCP8.5-SSP5 scenario. The
    northern Midwest, coastal Pacific Northwest, central California, and northern
    Utah are projected to experience the greatest increase in risk.
  12: Substantial increase in risk of prolonged heat stress in several parts of the
    CONUS due to global-mean warming; risk more than doubled in certain regions due
    to population growth.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis uses observations, climate projections from the CMIP5 model, and historical
    and future population estimates to examine potential impacts using the IPCC risk
    framework.
  7: Uses the concept of Relative Risk (RR) to investigate changes in PI of heat stress
    due to population change, climate change, and their interaction. Fixes either
    population or climate change at 2015 levels to isolate the effect of the other.
  11: The study investigates changes in the risk of potential impact (PI) of high-end
    summer heat stress (HS) events based on relative risk (RR). The analysis considers
    different durations of HS events (1-day, 3-day, and 7-day) under different climate
    scenarios (RCP4.5-SSP2 and RCP8.5-SSP5) in the near-future and far-future.
  12: Analysis based on severity and temporal variability of events, using a generalized
    extreme value (GEV) approach applicable across different locations.
More Notes:
  7: Focuses on heat stress exposure within the CONUS (contiguous United States).
    The heat stress metric is the Annual Maximum Heat Index (AM-HI).
  11: The effect of climate change is greatest in central California, coastal Pacific
    Northwest, and the Great Lakes, while population changes contribute substantially
    to the other regions mentioned.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  5: No relevant information
  7: Heat stress exposure, measured by changes in the probability index (PI) of heat
    stress.
  11: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  5: No relevant information
  7: Presents modeled projections of extreme heat stress (AM-HI) for RCP8.5 and RCP4.5
    scenarios from 2020-2100. Also shows spatial maps of the temporal mean of AM-HI
    for the CONUS for present, near-future, and far-future periods.
  11: More than 3x likely increase in risk of PI due to the total effect of climate
    and population changes in the northern Midwest, coastal Pacific Northwest, central
    California, and northern Utah under the RCP8.5-SSP5 emission scenario, and a 2.5x
    increase in the Southeast Piedmont, northern Texas, and portions of the Southwest.
