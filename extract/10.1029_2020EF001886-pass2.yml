Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Short-to-medium duration (1\u20137 days) heat stress (HS) events, climate change,\
    \ population growth."
  3: Daily maximum air temperature (Tmax) and daily mean relative humidity (RH) are
    the key climate drivers. Population changes are also considered as a risk driver.
  4: The primary driver of risk is extreme heat, specifically 1-, 3-, and 7-day HS
    events. Future climate scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are used. Population changes
    based on SSP2 and SSP5 scenarios are also included.
  7: The drivers of risk are climate change (specifically changes in 40-year heat
    index and warm temperature spell trends) and population change. The climate change
    scenarios examined are RCP8.5 and RCP4.5.
  8: The primary driver of risk is increasing temperature and absolute humidity, which
    leads to a nonlinear increase in the Heat Index (HI). The analysis focuses on
    the impact of RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 emission scenarios on future heat stress severity.
  10: Climate change effect, population effect, and a residual effect.
  11: Changes in 40YHI (heat index threshold) and WTS (trends in summer extremes),
    climate change, and population changes.
  12: Global-mean warming and population growth are identified as key drivers of PI
    increases.
  13: Rising temperatures, humidity, changes in precipitation patterns, compound drought
    and heatwaves, weakened flow and persistent circulation.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Potential impact (PI) of summer heat stress for the contiguous United States
    as a function of non-stationary HS characteristics and population exposure.
  3: Health risks are the outcome being evaluated, specifically heat stress (HS).
  4: This study evaluates high-end heat stress (HS) severity, defined as the magnitude
    of the 40-year return value of the Heat Index (HI).
  7: The paper evaluates heat stress exposure due to population change, climate change,
    and their interaction, focusing on extreme heat severity as measured by AM-HI
    (annual mean heat index).
  8: The paper evaluates the severity of extreme heat stress (HS) using the Heat Index
    (HI) and its potential impact based on mortality rates associated with severe
    heat conditions.
  10: Heat stress incidents across the United States.
  11: Changes in population exposure to heat stress (HS) characteristics, and risk
    of potential impact (PI) of high-end summer HS events.
  12: Potential Impact (PI) from short and long duration extreme Heat Stress (HS)
    is evaluated.
  13: Heat wave exposure; heat-related health impacts (illness, mortality).
Highlights:
  1: "Potential impact of short-to-medium duration (1\u20137 days) heat stress (HS)\
    \ events is likely to increase more than three-fold across densely populated regions\
    \ of the U.S. The largest increase in HS risk is projected across the coastal\
    \ Pacific Northwest, central California, and Great Lakes. In the coastal East\
    \ and many parts of the West, population growth alone is responsible for a large\
    \ share of the increases."
  3: The study decomposes the relative importance of climate and population changes
    to identify targeted strategies for limiting total health risks in each region.
  4: "The study estimates high-end heat stress severity by calculating the 40-year\
    \ return value of the heat index under various climate scenarios and time periods.\
    \ Non-stationarity is incorporated into the GEV model by allowing the location\
    \ (\xB5) and scale (\u03C3) parameters to vary with time."
  7: The study quantifies the relative impacts of climate change and population change
    on heat stress exposure. It examines extreme heat severity using AM-HI for different
    durations (1-day, 3-day, 7-day) under RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios. The investigation
    uses a relative risk framework to examine future increases in heat stress exposure.
  8: "Extreme heat stress severity is projected to increase significantly across the\
    \ CONUS, especially in the Gulf of Mexico, Southeast Atlantic coastal regions,\
    \ East, Midwest, and Great Plains, with HI values potentially exceeding 40.6\xB0\
    C, which are associated with high mortality rates. The analysis highlights that\
    \ heat stress increases may be more pronounced than increases in temperature alone,\
    \ particularly in the Midwest and South. The 40-year return levels for annual\
    \ maximum HI will amplify in the Gulf of Mexico, Southeast Atlantic coastal plains,\
    \ Appalachians, Midwest, and Great Plains regions"
  10: Examines how climate change and population factors might influence future heat
    stress incidents across the U.S. in various scenarios, regions, and time frames.
  11: A considerably larger population is likely to be exposed to more severe 40YHI
    in future decades, particularly under the RCP8.5-SSP5 scenario. The risk of PI
    due to climate and population changes is expected to increase significantly in
    several regions under the RCP8.5-SSP5 scenario.
  12: Substantial increase in the risk of PI from both short and long duration extreme
    HS in several parts of the CONUS is indicated. The possible increases noted over
    the Pacific Northwest, central California, and a major portion of the Mid-west
    will most likely be dominated by global-mean warming. Population growth will significantly
    increase PI in the Northeast, Southeastern Piedmont, coastal Pacific Northwest,
    and parts of Texas, Utah, and California.
  13: Deadly heat waves are projected in densely populated agricultural regions; the
    emergence of heat and humidity too severe for human tolerance; increasing probability
    of mortality during Indian heat waves; climate change will affect global water
    availability through compounding changes in seasonal precipitation and evaporation.
Methodology:
  1: Uses observations, climate projections from the CMIP5 model ensemble, and historical
    and future population estimates, and applies the IPCC risk framework.
  3: "Heat Index (HI) is calculated using Tmax and RH data. Historical Tmax is from\
    \ CPC, and RH is derived from CPC Tmax and ERA5 dew point temperature (Td) using\
    \ the Magnus approximation. Future projections use CMIP5 GCM outputs. Bias correction\
    \ is applied to model-calculated HI, matching it to reanalysis data (CPC and ERA5)\
    \ for the historical period (1979\u20132005). RH for GCMs is derived from specific\
    \ humidity (q) and surface pressure (Ps)."
  4: The study uses a non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) framework to
    estimate the 40YHI for different climate scenarios (present, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5)
    and time periods (historical (1980-2019), near-future (2020-2059), and far-future
    (2060-2099)). The Block Maxima (BM) method is applied to yearly maxima of summer
    HI (AM-HI). Population data is interpolated to a 2-degree grid resolution.
  7: The paper uses CMIP5 model projections and historical observations. It investigates
    changes in heat stress exposure using a relative risk (RR) concept. The effects
    of climate change and population change are assessed by fixing one indicator (population
    or climate) at 2015 levels while allowing the other to change, examining the contribution
    of each while accounting for non-linear effects.
  8: "The analysis uses the daily maximum Heat Index (HI) to estimate the annual maximum\
    \ magnitude of summer extreme heat stress (HS) severity. Historical data is derived\
    \ from a reanalysis data set. Future projections are based on the model-ensemble\
    \ average from 9 CMIP5 global-climate models (GCMs) and are bias-corrected. The\
    \ study examines 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day rolling averages of daily HI values.\
    \ The analysis considers present (1980\u20132019), near-future, and far-future\
    \ periods under RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 emission scenarios."
  10: Maps and boxplots analyzing projected changes in heat stress across the US under
    different scenarios (RCP4.5-SSP2 and RCP8.5-SSP5) for near-future and far-future
    periods, considering climate change and population effects.
  11: Uses mean population estimates for near- and far-future periods under SSP2 and
    SSP5 socioeconomic pathways, with RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios. Analyzes
    changes in population exposure to 40YHI and WTS using contour plots. Investigates
    changes in risk of PI based on relative risk (RR). Baseline population fixed to
    2015 CONUS.
  12: The analysis uses a GEV (Generalized Extreme Value) approach, considering severity
    and temporal variability relative to local climate, and changing population patterns.
    The approach is flexible and applicable across a range of event types and durations.
    The analysis focuses on Heat Stress (HS).
  13: Statistical modeling of extreme values; analysis of remotely sensed data and
    social-ecological indicators; climate model ensembles; analysis of temperature-duration-frequency
    curves.
More Notes:
  8: The study emphasizes the importance of considering temporal aspects of heat extremes
    (1-day, 3-day, and 7-day durations). The averaging of multiple models may smooth
    out spatial structures in future projections.
  10: The analysis decomposes the total effect into climate change, population, and
    residual effects.
  11: The effect of population dynamics and trends in WTS is reflected in the changes
    in the risk of PI of HS over the CONUS. Climate models may not faithfully capture
    slower-moving Rossby waves in the Northeast.
Quantitative material:
  1: "PI of short-to-medium duration (1\u20137 days) HS events is likely to increase\
    \ more than three-fold across densely populated regions of the U.S. by late this\
    \ century (2060\u20132099) under the highest emissions scenario. Climate change\
    \ alone more than doubles the impact in the coastal Pacific Northwest, central\
    \ California, and the Great Lakes region."
  3: "Heat Index (HI) is calculated based on an algorithm discussed in Anderson G.\
    \ Brooke et al., 2013, using Tmax and RH. Historical analysis covers 1979-2019.\
    \ Future projections use RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios from 2006 to 2100. Spatial\
    \ resolution is 2\xB0 within the CONUS region. Population data is at 1 km resolution,\
    \ available from 2000-2020 at a five-year interval."
  4: The study estimates the 40-year return value of the HI (40YHI).
  7: The paper presents spatial averages of historical observations and CMIP5 model
    projections of AM-HI under RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios from 2020-2100. Relative
    risk (RR) values are used to compare future and present climate scenarios, with
    RR > 1 indicating an increase. The analysis also uses 40YHI (40-year Heat Index)
    values. Maps show mean AM-HI for 1980-2019, 2020-2059, and 2060-2099 under RCP8.5
    for 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day heat severity metrics.
  8: "Under RCP8.5, CONUS-mean 1day-HS (7days-HS) severity is projected to increase,\
    \ resulting in HI values up to 3.6\xB0C (2.5\xB0C) and up to 6\xB0C (4.6\xB0C)\
    \ warmer than the measured air temperature beyond mid-century. Heat Index values\
    \ exceeding 40.6\xB0C are projected to intensify and spread over the East, Midwest,\
    \ and Great Plains under the RCP8.5 emission scenario. They also calculate 40-year\
    \ return intervals for annual maximum HI and temperature."
  10: Projected relative risk (R.R.) of heat stress incidents, with a color scale
    representing increase or decrease.
  11: More than 3x likely increase in risk of PI in the northern Midwest, coastal
    Pacific Northwest, central California, and northern Utah under the RCP8.5-SSP5
    emission scenario, and a 2.5x increase in the Southeast Piedmont, northern Texas,
    and portions of the Southwest.
  12: Risk of PI is likely to increase by more than two times due to population growth
    alone in the Northeast, Southeastern Piedmont, coastal Pacific Northwest, and
    parts of Texas, Utah, and California.
