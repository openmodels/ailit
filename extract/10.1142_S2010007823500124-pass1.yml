Drivers of Risk:
  6: Droughts, higher rainfall variability, increased average temperatures, heat extremes,
    and high atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.
  14: Increase in the maximum and minimum temperatures higher than the average temperature
    rise projections; reduction of average rainfall
  15: Temperature rise, more evapotranspiration, increase in very hot days, more heatwaves,
    increase in solar radiation, reduction in average rainfall, greater interannual
    variability of rainfall, more consecutive dry days, reduction in the number of
    consecutive humid days, increase in the dry season duration.
  16: Climate change impacts on agriculture, especially on key commodities like soybeans
    and corn.
  17: Declining agricultural productivity due to climate change.
  18: Climate change represented by IPCC-AR5 (2013) scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5,
    changes in temperature and rainfall patterns.
  19: 'Climate change, specifically considering two Representative Concentration Pathways
    (RCP) scenarios: RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5.'
  20: "Increase of 1\xB0C in average temperature."
  21: Difficulty for family farming to invest in and use agricultural technological
    innovations, limited access to technical assistance, rural extension services,
    agricultural credit, and climate information.
  23: Increased frequency and intensity of extreme events (high temperatures, floods,
    droughts, low water levels) in the Amazon; Deforestation and forest degradation.
  25: Projected climate change, increased temperature, drought, increased desertification,
    more extreme heat, reduction of average rainfall, increased seasonal and spatial
    variability, greater frequency and intensity of droughts.
  29: High cost of implementing climate-smart agricultural techniques compared to
    conventional production systems.
  32: Temperature rise, rainfall reduction, longer and more frequent heat waves and
    droughts, increased risk of forest fires and floods (north), increased desertification
    in the semiarid, higher risk of savannization of the Amazon rainforest.
  33: Extreme weather conditions (droughts, floods, intense climate events) affecting
    crops and agricultural production; limited access to public policies for climate
    change adaptation, including financing and technical assistance; socioeconomic
    and political inequalities faced by traditional women and peoples; gender discrimination
    limiting women's access to resources.
Highlights:
  6: Climate change negatively impacts agriculture, leading to harvest losses, reduced
    productivity, and increased food insecurity, with significant implications for
    poverty, income inequality, and hunger.
  14: Rainfall reduction is clearer in the Northern region, with significant increase
    in variability. The Northeast also reveals great rainfall variability. Temperature
    increase is projected for both regions, with higher increases under the SSP5-8.5
    scenario.
  15: Climate change is expected to intensify throughout the 21st century, particularly
    under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, leading to negative shocks in water and food security,
    health, socioeconomic development, and agricultural production in the North and
    Northeast regions.
  16: Climate change is likely to increase regional disparities across Brazilian states
    and municipalities because the most affected areas are those that already show
    lower productivity. The North and Northeast regions will be greatly impacted,
    while the South may even benefit.
  17: Regions whose economies are more dependent on agriculture will experience greater
    losses. Poor workers and low-income groups dependent on agriculture will experience
    consumer losses and well-being losses, mainly in the Northeast and Midwest.
  18: Family farmers are more vulnerable to climate change. Family farming experiences
    greater productivity losses than large-scale agriculture. Certain crops (cassava,
    coffee beans, and banana in family farming; maize, cotton, and orange in large-scale
    agriculture) are expected to experience the greatest accumulated losses by 2050.  The
    negative impacts on agriculture have a negative and cumulative impact on the rest
    of the economy.
  19: Climate change is projected to negatively impact family farming and commercial
    agriculture productivity in the Northern and Northeastern states of Brazil, with
    some areas potentially experiencing up to a 100% decrease in productivity under
    the RCP 8.5 scenario.
  20: "An increase of 1\xB0C at average temperature causes losses of up to 20% to\
    \ national agriculture. The North and Northeast regions are more impaired than\
    \ the national average. Lower levels of agricultural productivity experience more\
    \ significant negative effects of climate change."
  21: Family farming in Brazil, particularly in the North and Northeast, faces barriers
    to adopting technological innovations, leading to lower productivity and increased
    vulnerability to climate change.
  23: Climate change, deforestation and forest degradation have multiple socioeconomic
    effects which are more intensely felt by family farmers and traditional communities
    in the Amazon region, specifically leading to lower availability of flora, animals
    for hunting and fish; reduction of forest resources; and increased exposure to
    disease vectors.
  25: Climate change is expected to compromise agricultural activities, mainly those
    of family farmers, and disrupt local and regional food markets in semiarid regions.
  29: Agroecological techniques including integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems
    (ICLFS) reduce GHG emissions with higher technological adhesion.
  32: Family farmers in the North and Northeast regions have lower adaptive capacity
    due to low income, dependence on agricultural production, and limited access to
    climate predictions or information about resilient agricultural practices.
  33: Family farmers in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil are particularly
    vulnerable to climate change impacts on their income and subsistence. Traditional
    groups (indigenous, quilombolas, riverine) and women are disproportionately affected
    due to existing inequalities.

    rainfall (1960-1990 and 1996-2006) on the Brazilian commercial agriculture, with
    disaggregated analyses for different categories of land values and productivity
    levels.
More Notes:
  14: There is greater uncertainty concerning rainfall projections.
  16: The analysis focuses on the impacts on family farming in the North and Northeast
    regions, an area that has been understudied
  17: The model differentiates between family farming and large-scale agriculture,
    and takes a large set of agricultural activities into consideration, representing
    the diversity of national production.

    loss, weakening the regional economy and quality of life, and potentially leading
    to migratory processes.
  33: Climate change threatens poverty reduction and improvement of living conditions
    associated with economic gains.
