Drivers of Risk:
  3: Constraints and limits to adaptation are critical to understanding the extent
    to which human and natural systems can successfully adapt to climate change.
  10: Constraints and limits to adaptation efforts, including economic, socio-cultural,
    physical, institutional, informational, awareness, technological, and financial
    constraints. Specific drivers mentioned are geographical features (rivers, coastlines)
    for ecosystem-based responses.
Highlights:
  3: Most literature identifies constraints to adaptation, but there is limited literature
    focused on limits to adaptation. Central and South America and Small Islands generally
    report greater constraints and both hard and soft limits to adaptation. Technological,
    infrastructural, and ecosystem-based adaptation suggest more evidence of constraints
    and hard limits. Individuals and households face economic and socio-cultural constraints
    which also inhibit behavioral adaptation responses. Finance, governance, institutional,
    and policy constraints are most prevalent globally.
  10: Adaptation constraints and limits may have widespread effects, particularly
    in Small Islands. Food, fiber, and other ecosystem products, and poverty and livelihoods/sustainable
    development emerge as sectors with the largest share of papers on constraints/limits.
    Ocean and cryosphere adaptation is particularly challenging and already faces
    limits. Technological and infrastructural responses are strongly associated with
    information, awareness, technology, and financial constraints.
Methodology:
  3: Systematic review of academic studies on human adaptation responses to identify
    patterns in constraints and limits to adaptation for different regions, sectors,
    hazards, adaptation response types, and actors. Uses IPCC definitions of constraints
    and limits.
  10: The analysis involves a review of adaptation papers and statistical analysis
    (Bonferroni-corrected chi-square tests) to identify relationships between constraints
    and adaptation response types.
More Notes:
  3: Findings provide early signposts for boundaries of human adaptation and are of
    high relevance for guiding proactive adaptation financing and governance from
    local to global scales.
  10: The paper identifies regional differences in sectoral concentrations regarding
    constraints/limits (e.g., health in Australasia/Small Islands, infrastructure
    in Europe). It also distinguishes between 'soft' and 'hard' limits to adaptation
    and suggests that Small Islands may face more difficult-to-overcome soft limits
    due to a high number of identified constraints.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: No relevant information
  10: The paper implicitly addresses economic costs and benefits of adaptation by
    examining constraints and limits to adaptation efforts.
Quantitative material:
  3: The paper reviews 1,682 academic studies.
  10: The paper includes quantitative data on the number of adaptation papers and
    papers identifying constraints/limits across different regions, including the
    percentage of papers focusing on specific sectors and regions.
