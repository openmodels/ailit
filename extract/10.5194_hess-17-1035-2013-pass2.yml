Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global warming causing changes in glacier and snow melt.
Highlights:
  1: "Glacier melt is an important water source for central Chile in (La Ni\xF1a)\
    \ years with little precipitation."
Methodology:
  1: Quantitative analysis of the isotopic composition of streamflow and its sources
    to determine glacier melt and snowmelt contributions. Isotopic ratios of both
    H and O were monitored during one year in a high-altitude basin.
No relevant information:
  9: No relevant information
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Predicted decreases in glacier melt due to global warming may have a negative
    long-term impact on water availability in the Central Andes, which houses much
    of the country's growing economic production.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Glacier melt contribution of 50\u201390% to streamflow for the unusually dry\
    \ melt year of 2011/2012 in the studied basin. Glacier cover of the studied basin\
    \ is 11.5%."
