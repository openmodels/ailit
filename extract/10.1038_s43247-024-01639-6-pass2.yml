Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in climate (temperature and humidity), urbanization, and population growth
  2: The primary driver of risk is climate, specifically temperature and humidity,
    which affect mosquito survival and viral propagation.
  3: Changes in temperature and relative humidity, represented by the climate suitability
    Index P, and population growth are analyzed as drivers of changes in DENV transmission.
  4: Climate effects, population effects
  5: Changes in climate suitability (defined as average suitability from 1979-1983
    vs 2018-2022), human population growth, and non-climatic factors (e.g., herd immunity).
  6: Increases in dengue climate suitability due to changes in climate and population
    growth, particularly in densely populated urban environments.
  7: Population growth in areas with high climate suitability and poor urban planning
    are driving increased DENV transmission risk.

Highlights:
  1: Expansion in climate suitability in North America, East Asia, and the Mediterranean
    basin. In the Global South, increase largely driven by population growth in areas
    with historically favorable climate suitability, while in the Global North this
    increase predominantly occurred in previously unfavorable areas with limited population
    growth.
  2: Climate suitability is concentrated in tropical and near-equatorial regions.
    There is a correlation between climate suitability and dengue incidence across
    different countries (Taiwan, Vietnam, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Thailand).
  3: The study presents the average climate suitability per pixel from 1979 to 2022,
    highlighting areas that remain suitable for transmission throughout the year and
    also accounts for areas.
  4: Areas of high climate suitability generally had higher dengue incidence than
    areas of low climate suitability across municipalities in Brazil and Colombia.
  5: Population growth is responsible for a larger increase in people living in high-risk
    areas than climate change alone, except in the Global North.
  6: The most significant increases in dengue climate suitability occurred in high-density
    urban areas and regions with historically high suitability, while some regions
    like Europe saw little change.
  7: A substantial increase in global populations living in high climate suitability
    areas for DENV transmission, leading to expected increases in DENV activity in
    the Global South.

Methodology:
  1: Examined how shifts in temperature, humidity, and human population growth have
    contributed to changes in the geographical distribution and size of the global
    population living in areas with high climate suitability from 1979 to 2022, using
    estimates of dengue transmission suitability based on historical temperature and
    humidity data.
  2: The analysis uses mechanistic and statistical modeling approaches, including
    species distribution modeling, to estimate associations between climate variables
    and dengue or vector observations. Mechanistic models aim at quantifying transmission
    potential based on mosquito-viral traits and climate interactions. Statistical
    approaches estimate associations between climate variables and dengue or vector
    observations. The applicability of the results spans from 1979 to 2022 for climate
    suitability and varies by country for incidence data (e.g., 2000-2014 for Brazil,
    2007-2017 for Colombia).
  3: The study uses Index P, a mechanistic dengue suitability measure for Ae. aegypti
    mosquitoes based on temperature and relative humidity, to estimate monthly time
    series of global climate suitability from 1979 to 2022 at a spatial resolution
    of approximately 11 km. Trends were analyzed using monthly Index P time series
    from 1979-2022, with significance assessed using a false discovery rate (FDR)
    < 0.10.
  4: Uses reported dengue case counts for countries with dengue surveillance data
    to characterize the relationship between estimated climate suitability and observed
    dengue incidence. Climate suitability was considered high when it exceeded a threshold
    of 0.5.
  5: "Censored linear regression model for each country was fitted with mean annual\
    \ incidence as the outcome, climate suitability as a binary independent variable,\
    \ and population density and population size as covariates.  A random-effects\
    \ model was used for meta-analysis across countries. Long-term trends in monthly\
    \ time series of suitability were quantified using a seasonal Mann\u2013Kendall\
    \ test."
  6: Analysis uses a dengue suitability measure incorporating temperature and humidity
    effects on mosquito-viral traits, applied globally for periods 1979-1983 and 2017-2022.
  7: The study considers empirical effects of temperature and humidity on transmission
    suitability but acknowledges limitations due to other factors like precipitation,
    altitude, and urbanization.
  8: Technical validation involves correlation with reported dengue case data in Brazil,
    Thailand, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Taiwan for various periods.
  9: Uncertainty was addressed using 1000 samples to estimate credible intervals for
    Index P distributions.

More Notes:
  2: The paper acknowledges limitations of both mechanistic and statistical approaches,
    including sparse reporting in low-transmission areas, difficulty capturing nonlinear
    interactions, and reliance on single minimum/maximum values for climate-based
    limits. It also mentions that models are often developed on locally-specific parameter
    estimates, which limits their applicability.
  3: The study focuses on Ae. aegypti mosquitoes due to their primary role in vector-human
    transmission of dengue virus and the availability of detailed empirical data on
    meteorological variables and vector-viral traits.
  4: The study identifies areas where reported dengue cases are lower than expected
    from the estimated climate suitability, potentially due to factors such as low
    population density, poor surveillance, and limited connectivity.

Quantitative material:
  1: Estimated that the population in areas with high climate suitability has grown
    by approximately 2.5 billion globally from 1979 to 2022.
  2: "The paper presents data on mean yearly dengue incidence (cases per 100,000 population)\
    \ across municipalities/provinces/cantons in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Taiwan,\
    \ Thailand, and Vietnam. It also presents climate suitability on an Index P scale,\
    \ categorized into low (<0.5) and high (\u22650.5)."
  3: The study quantifies local and global changes in climate suitability for DENV
    transmission using a monthly time resolution and a spatial resolution of approximately
    11 km. It uses a color scale where dark blue indicates decreases in climate suitability
    [(-1, -0.010]], light blue = [[-0.010, -0.005)], [-0.005, -0.0001)], and colors
    indicating increasing suitability such as light orange = [[0.0001, 0.005)], medium
    orange = [[0.005, 0.010)], dark orange = [[0.010, 1]].
  4: "Estimated changes in land area and population with high climate suitability\
    \ from 1979\u20131983 to 2018\u20132022."
  5: Population and climate effects independently contributed 2.16 billion and 182
    million more people in high-risk areas, respectively, globally.
  6: Quantitative changes in high climate suitability areas are reported, e.g., global
    increase from 58.5% to 66.2% in high-density areas and from 48.1% to 63.6% in
    very high-density areas.
  7: Approximately 70% of populations in Africa and Asia are living in areas with
    a high risk of dengue infection, a 15% increase relative to four decades earlier.
