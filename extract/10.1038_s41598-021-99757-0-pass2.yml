Drivers of Risk:
  3: The main drivers of risk are different Representative Concentration Pathways
    (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), representing varying levels of
    greenhouse gas emissions and societal development patterns.
  4: The primary drivers of risk include changes in GDP per capita and climate variables
    (e.g., temperature changes).
  6: Climate change scenarios RCP2.6/SSP1 (sustainable) and RCP8.5/SSP5 (fossil-fuel
    dependent).
  8: Future heat exposure
  9: In a RCP8.5/SSP5 future, cities in arid and semi-arid climates face increased
    heat exposures and related risks.
  10: Climate change (specifically heat exposure), socio-economic development pathways
    (SSPs), greenhouse gas concentration trajectories (RCPs)
  11: Changes in climate variables like daily mean temperature, daily mean humidity,
    and daily mean wind speed leading to exceedance of minimum mortality temperatures
    (MMTs) in cities.
Highlights:
  3: "The paper highlights the distributions of absolute MMT for 2100, 2090\u2013\
    2099 exceedance days, and 2090\u20132099 exceedance magnitude, as well as parameter\
    \ changes in MMT from 2000\u20132100 and changes in exposure from 1991\u20132000\
    \ to 2090\u20132099."
  4: Cities in the northern hemisphere show larger adaptation gains with high GDP/capita
    enabling more significant adaptation, especially under RCP8.5/SSP5; highest GDP/capita
    is observed in SSP5 scenario.
  6: The paper highlights disparities in future exposure concerning the selected scenario
    combinations. A fossil fuel-dependent future (RCP8.5/SSP5) leads to increased
    EXD and MAG in many cities, particularly in southern Europe, North America, Sub-Saharan
    Africa, India, East Asia, northwestern Mexico, Brazil, and Pakistan, India. A
    sustainable scenario (RCP2.6/SSP1) leads to reduced EXD and smaller MAG changes.
  8: "Future adaptation and heat exposure for\_3820 cities worldwide have been assessed\
    \ jointly for the first time. Under RCP2.6/SSP1, 84% of cities see a reduction\
    \ in days of exposure, while 59.8% see a reduction under RCP8.5/SSP5."
  9: RCP2.6/SSP1 offers significant benefits for urban populations' health by reducing
    heat exposure more than RCP8.5/SSP5.
  10: Demonstrates the necessity to integrate a socio-economic aspect to assess future
    adaptation; Sustainable economic growth contributes to adaptation and maintains
    low forcing; A strong socio-economic development based on fossil-fuel exploitation
    amplifies extreme heat exposures.
  11: The study estimates future MMTs for cities using a calibrated model based on
    climate, topography, and socio-economic variables. The re-calibrated model using
    gridded climate data preserves the relative importance of all independent variables
    as in Krummenauer et al.20, with only a minor penalty of using coarser gridded
    climate data (RMSE of 3.2 C vs. 2.8 C).
Methodology:
  3: The analysis examines the distributions of adaptation and exposure parameters
    (MMT, EXD, MAG) under different RCP/SSP combinations for the periods 2090-2099,
    compared to 1991-2000 for exceedance days and magnitude, and 2000 for Mean Maximum
    Temperature.
  4: The analysis is based on scenario combinations of RCP and SSP, calculating changes
    in climate and economic variables (e.g., GDP/capita) and their effects on mean
    temperature deviations (MMT).
  6: The study uses scenario analysis (RCP2.6/SSP1 and RCP8.5/SSP5) to project changes
    in EXD and MAG between 2000 and 2090-2099.
  8: "The analysis assesses future adaptation and heat exposure for 3820 cities worldwide,\
    \ considering RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 and SSPs 1\u20135 until 2100. The study\
    \ contrasts two options of high socio-economic development facilitating wealth-enabled\
    \ adaptation but diverging heat exposure to identify the least unfavorable choice\
    \ for human health outcomes."
  9: The study examines urban populations' adaptation and exposure to heat in 3820
    cities globally under different climate and socio-economic pathways.
  10: Uses locally extended SSPs jointly with RCPs to estimate future summer excess
    mortality; Assesses future adaptation and exposure changes until the end of the
    century; Employs climate data from CMIP5 and ISIMIP for GCMs under different RCPs;
    Calculates ensemble means across GCMs.
  11: A multivariate non-linear model is used to estimate future minimum mortality
    temperatures (MMTs) for cities based on climatic, topographic, and socio-economic
    variables. The model is calibrated using historical climate data (1965-1995) and
    socio-economic data from 2000. Future MMTs are estimated for 2100 using projected
    climate data (2065-2095) and GDP/capita data from various Socio-economic Pathways
    (SSPs). The frequency of days exceeding MMT is calculated for 2000 and 2099 to
    assess the magnitude of the exceedance.
More Notes:
  3: The vertical lines in the distributions indicate the medians, and distributions
    for exceedance days and magnitude are trimmed.
  6: The page focuses on specific cities and does not provide national-level macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes, cost/benefit analysis of adaptation strategies, nor does it
    mention adaptation strategies.
  8: The paper focuses on heat exposure and adaptation at the city level and its impact
    on human health outcomes. It does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes at the national level.
  9: A future according to RCP8.5/SSP5 would critically endanger cities in specific
    global regions with increased heat-related mortality.
  10: The study assumes instantaneous adaptation to heat (especially wealth-enabled
    adaptation) and no changes in health condition and heat-related mortality among
    city populations until 2100; The study focuses on ensemble means instead of scrutinising
    the influence of GCMs.
  11: The study uses data from multiple sources, including the World Bank, IIASA,
    OECD, and CIESIN. The analysis is performed for 400 cities across all climate
    zones and world regions. The study uses a non-linear least-squares fit to re-calibrate
    the model.

    \ EXD reductions in some cities (\u2212 50 to 0 EXD). Specific MAG changes (both\
    \ increases and decreases in degrees Celsius) are provided for several cities\
    \ under both scenarios."
