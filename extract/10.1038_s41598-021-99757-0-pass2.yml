Drivers of Risk:
  4: The drivers of risk include changes in climate variables and GDP/capita. Specific
    shocks include future heat exposure.
  6: Changes in adaptation until 2100 are evaluated in RCP8.5/SSP5 scenarios, impacting
    extreme degree days (EXD) and mean annual temperature gradient (MAG) in cities.
  7: The primary driver of risk identified is climate change leading to increased
    heat exposure, as projected under different climate scenarios (RCP2.6/SSP1 and
    RCP8.5/SSP5).
  8: Changes in future heat exposure magnitude
  9: The drivers of risk are climate trajectories (RCPs) and socio-economic pathways
    (SSPs). Specifically mentioned are RCP2.6/SSP1 and RCP8.5/SSP5.
  11: Changes in climate variables, specifically daily mean temperature and humidity,
    and socio-economic factors such as GDP/capita.
  12: Daily mean apparent temperature (ATmean) is the primary driver of heat exposure
    risk. The study uses RCP/SSP combinations to project future climate scenarios.
  13: The papers referenced explore the impact of climate change, global warming,
    heat waves, and temperature (including summer temperatures) on mortality and health.
Evaluation overview:
  4: The paper evaluates changes in adaptation and exposure related to heat and its
    related mortality for urban populations.
  7: The paper discusses changes in future heat exposure frequency, specifically evaluating
    outcomes like increased heat exposure frequency (EXD) and magnitude (MAG) in cities
    worldwide, with implications for mortality.
  8: Future adaptation and heat exposure for 3820 cities worldwide
  9: The study evaluates heat exposure in cities.
  11: The study estimates Minimum Mortality Temperatures (MMTs) for historic and future
    scenarios across cities.
  12: Human heat adaptation in cities is evaluated by assessing critical heat exposure
    exceeding the MMT (a measure for human heat adaptation in cities).
  13: The papers referenced here seem to focus on temperature-related mortality impacts,
    heat adaptation as indicated by minimum mortality temperatures, and health effects
    of weather conditions.
Highlights:
  4: SSP5 generates the highest future mean country-based GDP/capita, but a high GDP/capita
    does not automatically lead to a better bearable situation regarding future heat
    and its related mortality for urban populations. Adaptation gains (Delta1MMT)
    are generally larger in the northern hemisphere (especially Western Europe) than
    in subtropical and tropical cities.
  6: In a RCP8.5/SSP5 future, a significant number of cities experience increases
    in EXD and MAG; these increments show intensified climate outcomes in certain
    regions.
  7: Key outcomes include potential substantial worsening of heat exposure under RCP8.5/SSP5,
    with many cities facing increased mortality, and a better outlook under RCP2.6/SSP1
    with reduced heat exposure in most cities.
  8: "For the first time, future adaptation and heat exposure for\_3820 cities worldwide\
    \ have been assessed jointly. Assessment envisages potential adaptation and exposure\
    \ changes until 2100"
  9: RCP2.6/SSP1 is beneficial for urban populations' health regarding heat exposure
    compared to RCP8.5/SSP5.
  11: "The model is re-calibrated to preserve the importance of all variables with\
    \ a minor increase in RMSE from 2.8\xB0C to 3.2\xB0C."
  12: The study assesses changes in critical heat exposure in cities by comparing
    historical (1991-2000) and future (2090-2099) periods, considering human heat
    adaptation.
Methodology:
  4: "The analysis is performed for a city sample under different RCP/SSP combinations,\
    \ projecting changes from 1991-2000 to 2090-2099. The results are applicable for\
    \ understanding the interplay between socioeconomic pathways and climate change\
    \ impacts on urban areas by the end of the 21st century. The greatest weighted\
    \ variable change (climate or GDP/capita) was identified for each city and compared\
    \ to the aggregated weight of the remaining variables\u2019 changes to determine\
    \ primary contributors to MMT."
  6: Analysis for RCP8.5/SSP5 scenarios includes regional assessments in world cities
    from 2000-2100 using tmap package in R version 3.6.2.
  8: Assessment of future adaptation and heat exposure jointly using RCPs 2.6, 4.5,
    6.0 and 8.5 and SSPs 1-5 until 2100.
  9: The approach assesses urban populations' adaptation and exposure to heat in 3820
    cities across the globe. The analysis compares changes from 1991-2000 to 2090-2099.
  11: The analysis uses a generalized multivariate non-linear model to estimate MMTs
    based on climate, topographic, and socio-economic variables, with calibration
    done using gridded climate data from ISIMIP project for historic and future periods.
  12: "The study uses historic and projected MMTs for 3820 cities under different\
    \ RCP/SSP combinations.  It calculates the number of days ATmean exceeds MMT,\
    \ then computes the mean number of exposure days (EXD) for the historical period\
    \ (1991-2000) and future period (2090-2099). Delta changes (\u0394EXD and \u0394\
    MAG) are calculated by subtracting historical values from future values.  The\
    \ analysis is performed in R."
  13: The references include the use of climate change scenarios (RCPs and SSPs),
    Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2b) simulations, statistical
    computing in R, and modeling methods for heat-related mortality.
More Notes:
  8: EXD and MAG are not defined on this page, so it is hard to understand precisely
    what the numbers mean.
  9: Arid and semi-arid climates (e.g., southwestern USA, northern Mexico, Brazil,
    Sahel, Arabian Peninsula, Middle East, Pakistan, and India) are likely to experience
    increased heat-related mortality under RCP8.5/SSP5. Socio-economic growth only
    contributes to future heat adaptation as long as it is generated sustainably.
  11: The combination of RCP 2.6 with SSP3 is excluded from future MMT estimations.
  12: The study acknowledges that the feasibility of combining RCP2.6 and SSP5 is
    questionable and largely neglected in their analysis. They account for long-term
    physiological acclimatization by employing long-term climate variables. Adaptation
    likely does not change significantly from one year to another.

    those references likely cover. The Krummenauer study was supported by the Potsdam
    Graduate School (PoGS).

Quantitative material:
  4: The paper provides quantitative information on the change in exceedance days
    from 1991-2000 to 2090-2099, changes in mean mortality temperature (MMT) between
    2000-2100, and GDP/capita in 2000 and projected for 2100 under different SSPs.
    It also gives specific cities and their changes in MMT.
  6: "RCP8.5/SSP5 scenarios show EXD increases of 0-92 in northwestern Mexico, Brazil,\
    \ Pakistan, and India, while positive \u03941MAG increments are observed up to\
    \ +5.4\xB0C in some cities."
  7: The analysis indicates that under RCP8.5/SSP5, 30% of cities will experience
    additional EXD, whereas under RCP2.6/SSP1, 6% of cities will face additional EXD.
    RCP2.6/SSP1 is expected to lead to reduced EXD by 84% of cities by 2090-2099.
  8: "Changes in exposure from 1991-2000 to 2090-2099 under RCP2.6/SSP1 and RCP8.5/SSP5\
    \ for 3820 world cities; e.g., Days reduction/increase in EXD, Reduction/Increase\
    \ in MAG [\xB0C], Percent of year EXD, >350 EXD"
  9: Under RCP8.5/SSP5, 5.1 times as many cities will face more frequent heat exposures
    and 4.3 times as many will experience higher exposure magnitudes than in RCP2.6/SSP1.
  12: "The analysis quantifies the annual number of days exceeding the MMT (EXD),\
    \ the delta change in EXD (\u0394EXD), the exceedance magnitude (MAG), and the\
    \ delta change in MAG (\u0394MAG) between 1991-2000 and 2090-2099."
