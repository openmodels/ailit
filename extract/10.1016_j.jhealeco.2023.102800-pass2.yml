Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increasing global temperatures leading to increased worker exposure to extreme
    heat, which negatively impacts cognition, learning, and task performance, potentially
    leading to workplace injuries and illnesses.
  2: Higher maximum temperatures.
  3: Maximum daily temperature within a postcode within a month-year.
  5: Outside ambient air temperature
  6: Maximum daily temperature, occupation type (laborers, tradespersons), time period.
  7: Daily maximum temperature
  8: Daily maximum temperature.
  9: Daily maximum temperature (today, yesterday, day before yesterday), last night
    minimum temperature.
  10: Increases in maximum temperature.
  11: Maximum daily temperature
  12: Maximum temperature (both today's and yesterday's) is the main driver of risk.
  13: Maximum temperature, climate warming.
  14: High outside temperatures leading to increased workplace injuries and diseases,
    particularly affecting manual workers in outdoor-based industries.
Highlights:
  1: High temperatures cause significantly more workplace injury claims, especially
    for manual workers in outdoor industries; this effect has increased over time.
  2: Higher maximum temperatures generate significantly more occupational health claims.
  3: The study identifies a relationship between daily temperature and occupational
    health claims.
  5: Impact of heat on daily number of occupational health claims is identified through
    day-to-day variation in temperature within a given month-year of a specific postal-area.
  6: Heat increases work-related accidents. The effect of temperature on claims is
    higher for laborers and tradespersons compared to other occupations. Hot weather
    has remained a significant threat to manual workers despite policy attempts and
    changes to the scheme.
  7: Higher maximum temperatures are associated with increased occupational health
    claims. The effect is more pronounced for 'high risk' occupations like tradespersons
    and laborers.
  8: Increased maximum temperatures lead to increases in occupational health claims,
    particularly for laborers and tradespersons.
  9: Same-day temperature has the largest impact on occupational health claims, but
    yesterday's temperature also has a statistically significant effect.
  10: Heat-related accidents significantly increase with temperature, particularly
    burns and accidents caused by 'heat'. The effect of heat extends beyond direct
    physiological responses, affecting concentration and psychomotor performance,
    leading to accidents such as hitting objects and being hit by moving objects.
  11: "Maximum temperature increase is associated with increased workers' compensation\
    \ claims, particularly for laborers and tradespersons in agriculture and construction.\
    \ The effect of temperature on worker's compensation claims varies by industry,\
    \ occupation, age, and firm size. High-income laborers and tradespersons in agriculture\
    \ and construction have the largest effects, with a 0.77% increase in claims per\
    \ 1\xB0C compared to 0.21% and 0.48% for their low-income and middle-income counterparts"
  12: The impact of temperature on worker health varies across different worker characteristics
    (sex, age, earnings, firm size). Low claim firms experience a greater percentage
    increase in claims per degree Celsius increase in temperature, suggesting that
    firm-level decisions and risk management practices may play a significant role
    in mitigating heat-related risks.
  14: Significant negative impact of high temperatures on workers' health; manual
    workers in high-risk occupations are most affected.
Methodology:
  1: "Analysis uses records spanning 1985\u20132020 from an Australian mandatory insurance\
    \ scheme."
  2: "Analysis of over two million occupational health claims submitted to a state-run\
    \ mandatory workers\u2019 compensation scheme in Victoria, Australia from 1985\
    \ to 2020, comparing differences in accident rates across days within the same\
    \ postcode and month."
  3: The study uses the Compensation Research Database (CRD) to analyze occupational
    health claims in Victoria, Australia, and matches claims with climatic variables
    at the postcode level.
  5: Area fixed-effects regression model to estimate the causal effect of outside
    ambient air temperature on the daily number of occupational health claims, using
    month-year-postcode fixed-effects, controlling for day of week and precipitation.
  6: "Regression analysis with standard errors clustered at the postcode level. Semi-elasticity\
    \ calculated as the percentage change in the number of claims for a 1\xB0C increase\
    \ in maximum temperature. Poisson and OLS regressions are used."
  7: Poisson regression is used to estimate the effect of daily maximum temperature
    on the number of occupational health claims per postcode. The main specification
    includes month-year-postcode fixed effects, day of the week fixed effects, and
    precipitation controls. Robust standard errors are clustered by postcode.
  8: "Poisson regression with Month-Year-Postcode fixed-effects. Effects shown for\
    \ the period 2000\u20132020."
  9: Poisson Regression with Month-Year-Postcode fixed effects. Analysis applies to
    laborers and tradespersons in 2000-2020. Robust standard errors clustered by postcode.
  10: "Poisson Regression with Month-Year-Postcode fixed effects. Analysis covers\
    \ the period 2000\u20132020 for high-risk occupations (laborers and tradespersons).\
    \ Standard errors clustered by postcode."
  11: Poisson regression with Month-Year-Postcode fixed effects. Robust standard errors
    clustered at postcode level. Data from 2000-2020. Semi-elasticity as percentage
    increase/decrease in number of claims.
  12: Poisson regression is used to estimate the effect of temperature on the number
    of claims, with robust standard errors clustered at the postcode level. A two-stage
    approach is used to analyze the impact of heat on worker health between different
    types of firms; a firm fixed effects model is applied to identify high- and low-claim
    firms.
  13: Poisson regression to estimate the effect of temperature on occupational health
    claims using data on laborers and tradespersons between 2005 and 2019 for firms
    in Construction, Manufacturing and Agriculture, Forestry & Fishing. Costs are
    estimated using unit costs of AU$258,700 for claims and AU$126,500 for all occupational
    injuries and diseases (Safe Work Australia, 2015).
  14: "Analyzed the number of days per year in 3\xB0C temperature bins and corresponding\
    \ claims data over a 35-year period to estimate cost impacts."
More Notes:
  1: The paper highlights that the effects of heat are context-specific, depending
    on location, time-period, and industrial relations and mitigation contexts, suggesting
    the need for data analysis from various settings.
  2: The study focuses on the impact of heat on worker's compensation claims in Victoria,
    Australia, considering factors like occupation, worker characteristics, and workplace
    characteristics. The effects measured are the residual risk after accounting for
    existing adaptation measures.
  3: "The study presents results as a semi-elasticity (i.e. the percentage change\
    \ in the number of claims for each 1 \u25E6C)."
  5: Results are presented as a semi-elasticity, interpreted as the residual effect
    of temperature on worker health net of adaption measures, such as reducing labor
    supply.
  6: The study uses workers' compensation claims data from Victoria, Australia. It
    acknowledges that the estimates focus on more serious accidents. The study accounts
    for compositional changes in the labor force.
  7: The study controls for air pollution (PM2.5) and calendar date fixed effects
    in some specifications. The largest effects may appear in the warmest time period
    suggesting limits on workers' ability to adapt.
  8: "Victorian workplaces may have implemented measures to mitigate worker heat exposure,\
    \ leading to lower claim effects at extreme temperatures (> 36 \u25E6C) compared\
    \ to other studies."
  9: Multicollinearity may be a concern given the correlation between current and
    past temperatures. The analysis attributes the effect of yesterday's temperature
    to delayed effects of heat exposure, rather than reporting errors.
  10: Heat may increase the volatility of chemicals and create hot surfaces, explosions
    or fires, leading to increased chemical-related accidents. The effects vary by
    industry, with 'Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing' being more negatively affected.
  11: The study finds that workers in large firms are less affected by temperature
    than those working in medium and small firms, potentially due to heat policies.
  12: The analysis focuses on claims from laborers and tradespersons at firms in the
    Construction, Manufacturing and Agriculture, Forestry & Fishing industries. Firm
    size is based on total annual remuneration in 2010/11 deflated to 2005/06 dollars.
    The study uses firm identification numbers for each claim, allowing for the analysis
    of firm-level effects.

Quantitative material:
  1: "High temperatures are found to cause significantly more claims, particularly\
    \ among manual workers in outdoor-based industries. The largest effect observed\
    \ for the 2015\u20132020 period, indicating increasing vulnerability to heat."
  2: "A one-degree Celsius increase in the daily maximum increases claims by 0.24%;\
    \ a day reaching 33\u201336 \u25E6C averages 5.3% more claims than a day 18\u2013\
    21 \u25E6C."
  3: The CRD recorded 2,156,960 claims corresponding to 1,159,249 unique claimants
    between 2nd September 1985 and 31st July 2020.
  5: No relevant information
  6: "A 1\xB0C increase in maximum temperature results in a 0.24% increase in occupational\
    \ health claims in Victoria per day."
  7: A 1 degree Celsius increase in daily maximum temperature is associated with a
    0.24% increase in occupational health claims (semi-elasticity) for all occupations.
    This effect varies by occupation, with high-risk occupations (Tradespersons and
    related workers; Laborers and related workers) showing larger effects (0.38% and
    0.33% respectively). Effects also vary over time, with the period 2000-2020 showing
    slightly different estimates compared to 1985-1999.
  8: "Laborers and tradespersons make 6.2% additional claims when the maximum temperature\
    \ is 33\u201336 \u25E6C, compared to 18\u201321 \u25E6C."
  9: "A 1\xB0C increase in today's maximum temperature leads to a 0.34% increase in\
    \ occupational health claims (p<0.01). A 1\xB0C increase in yesterday's maximum\
    \ temperature leads to a 0.14% increase in claims (p<0.01), conditional on today's\
    \ temperature. The combined effect of today's and yesterday's temperature increase\
    \ is a 0.42% increase in claims."
  10: "A 1 \xB0C increase in maximum temperature causes a 2.11% increase in heat-related\
    \ claims for laborers and tradespersons (p<0.01). Burns increase by 1.57% per\
    \ 1\xB0C (p<0.01). Diseases increase by 0.19% per 1\xB0C (p=0.02)."
  11: Semi-elasticity estimates (%) of maximum temperature on number of worker's compensation
    claims for various industries and occupations, e.g., for laborers and tradespersons
    in agriculture, forestry and fishing, a 0.76% increase in claims per degree Celsius
    increase (p=0.04). For laborers and tradespersons in Construction, 0.51% increase
    in claims per degree Celsius increase (p<0.01).
  12: "Table 6 provides semi-elasticities (%) showing the percentage increase or decrease\
    \ in the number of claims for different worker characteristics per unit increase\
    \ in maximum temperature. For example, a 0.35% increase in claims for all male\
    \ workers, a 0.46% increase for male laborers and tradespersons, and a 0.48% increase\
    \ for male laborers and tradespersons in agriculture or construction. Table 7\
    \ (not shown here but discussed in the text) finds that low claim firms experience\
    \ a 0.69% increase in claims for each additional 1\xB0C in daily maximum temperature."
  13: "A warming of Victoria\u2019s climate by 1.5 \u25E6C would result in an additional\
    \ 0.38% occupational health claims for all workers, equating to an additional\
    \ 156 claims per annum at a cost of AU$40.3 million for Victoria.  If we consider\
    \ all injuries and diseases, regardless of compensation, the annual cost of 1.5\
    \ \u25E6C of warming is AU$54.8 million, of which laborers and tradespersons account\
    \ for AU$37.4 million. Victoria averages 36 days each year over 30\u25E6C since\
    \ 2015, compared to 25 days each year in the 1980s."
  14: Annual cost of AU$26.3 million for claims and AU$35.6 million for all workplace
    injuries and diseases due to heat in Victoria.
