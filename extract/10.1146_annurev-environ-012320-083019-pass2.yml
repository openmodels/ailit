    \ the seafloor around carbonate platform environments in the Florida Keys, Caribbean,\
    \ and near Hawai\u2018i, accelerating the rate of relative sea-level rise and\
    \ endangering human safety and property."

Highlights:
  4: Ocean acidification is occurring due to rising atmospheric CO2. Coastal acidification
    can be exacerbated by upwelling systems, nutrient and organic carbon inputs, and
    low-alkalinity freshwater fluxes.
  5: Fish physiology is notably affected by high-CO2 conditions impacting otolith
    growth, mitochondrial function, metabolic rate, and neurosensory processes.
  6: Generalizations about species sensitivity to ocean acidification are difficult
    to make due to variations between species, life stages, populations, and co-stressors.
    Species sensitivity to CO2 is influenced by exposure to other aspects of climate
    change, with negative additive effects occurring with simultaneous exposure to
    high CO2 and low dissolved oxygen or elevated temperature. Predicting how marine
    populations will evolve in response to climate change and ocean acidification
    requires consideration of phenotypic plasticity and natural selection.
  7: Organisms may evolve more quickly than previously thought, especially via epigenetics.
  8: Experimental results from static environmental conditions may not be fully relevant
    to the dynamic conditions organisms experience in nature. Sensitivity research
    is focused on a limited group of taxa and may not reflect the diversity of marine
    species. Publication bias against sharing negative experimental results may limit
    the representativeness of available data. Considering one factor alone can yield
    incorrect information related to how a species might fare in a future ocean (additive,
    synergistic, or antagonistic effects).
  11: Ocean acidification, warming, and increased stratification drive changes in
    marine microbial community makeup, but effects on global ecosystem functions are
    not yet fully understood. Some zooplankton taxa are vulnerable to ocean acidification.
    Pteropods may already be experiencing shell dissolution in low-pH waters along
    the California Current. Ocean acidification could disrupt pelagic food webs via
    the proliferation of toxic algal blooms. Coral reefs have already suffered declines
    in net calcification associated with ocean acidification. Bioerosion may be more
    sensitive to changes in carbonate chemistry than carbonate production.
  13: Ocean acidification poses a present-day concern with direct implications for
    businesses and coastal communities, especially impacting bivalve shellfish harvests.
  15: Overlapping risk of reef loss from warming and acidification and social and
    economic vulnerability puts Southeast Asia at particular combined risk.
  18: Human CO2 emissions alter surface seawater acid-base chemistry globally. Biological
    impacts involve multiple chemical changes. Organism-level effects are being studied
    for impacts on communities and ecosystems. Multiple stressors need consideration
    in adaptation strategies.
  19: Local adaptation strategies are needed to minimize harm from the inevitable
    impacts of ocean acidification; Marine management strategies need updating to
    balance protection and sustainable human uses; Adaptive management systems must
    be developed to accommodate geographic and temporal shifts in living marine resources,
    and to nimbly address extreme events.

  21: Connects acidification to ecological principles, systematic assessment of ocean-based
    solutions, synthesis covering marine fish physiological impacts.
  22: Local adaptation can define sensitivity to future ocean acidification. Species-specific
    responses should account for local adaptation and adaptive plasticity. Negative
    yet variable effects of ocean acidification on marine organisms are revealed.
  24: Ocean acidification can lead to shifts in community structure, altered competitive
    interactions, loss of biodiversity, changes in trophic dynamics, and impacts on
    specific species' physiology.
  25: Ocean acidification can lead to food web changes, coral reef decline, shifts
    in species dominance, altered fish behavior, and impacts on shellfish.
  26: Seagrass and marine macroalgae are affected by climate change and ocean acidification;
    ocean acidification impacts shellfish industries and fisheries; ocean acidification
    and warming can alter the sensory quality and biochemical composition of seafood;
    eutrophication can offset some effects of ocean warming and acidification; some
    seagrass systems show unexpected resilience to global stressors.
  27: Lower pH drives strongest declines in benthic species in southern regions of
    the California Current, while greatest economic impacts occur in northern regions.

    acidification; Blue carbon emissions from degradation of coastal ecosystems

    responses to acidification; community and ecosystem impacts on key food-web interactions
    such as competition and predator-prey interactions; risks to human communities.

    \ 1988-2015, using discrete water samples to calculate trends."
  6: Experimental strategies are used to characterize species sensitivity to acidification
    now and in the future. Complementary approaches are needed due to limitations
    of individual techniques, such as short-term experiments or small-scale spatial
    range.

    dimensions.
  13: Highlights the challenges of detecting changes in ecosystem services and attributing
    them solely to ocean acidification due to multi-stressor contexts and adaptation.
  19: Interventions designed to address other issues (e.g., biodiversity loss, water
    quality, governance) may also help address harm from ocean acidification; Ultimate
    solution involves global-scale reductions in human CO2 emissions; Highlights need
    for increased monitoring, data synthesis, development and evaluation of adaptation
    solutions, and coproduction of knowledge between scientists, resource managers,
    and stakeholders.

    While the literature cited may be relevant, this specific page does not contain
    any direct findings or analyses.
  22: The page emphasizes the importance of considering multiple drivers of global
    ocean change and the role of inter-individual variation in predicting species'
    responses. There is evidence for adaptation to local pH conditions in the California
    Current Ecosystem. Transgenerational learned pathogenic avoidance has also been
    observed in the context of marine ecosystems.
  24: Many of the studies focus on the effects of ocean acidification alone or in
    combination with other stressors (e.g., warming). Several papers explore the role
    of trophic interactions and functional diversity in mediating the impacts of ocean
    acidification.
