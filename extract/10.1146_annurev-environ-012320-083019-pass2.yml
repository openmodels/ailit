Drivers of Risk:
  1: Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, from fossil fuel combustion and
    deforestation, along with agriculture and land-use practices are causing wholesale
    increases in seawater CO2 and inorganic carbon levels; reductions in pH; and alterations
    in acid-base chemistry.
  3: "Atmospheric CO2 and the concurrent ocean acidification are projected to continue\
    \ to rise through mid-century, if not longer, without deliberate and decisive\
    \ international action on climate mitigation and emissions reductions. Addition\
    \ of CO2 from natural and anthropogenic sources causes acidification and shifts\
    \ in the speciation of dissolved ions. Acidification impacts will depend on organism\
    \ responses to multiple, simultaneous chemical changes\u2014increasing CO2(aq),\
    \ HCO\u22123, and H+ and decreasing CO23. Many types of marine organisms that\
    \ form shells and skeletons from calcium carbonate (CaCO3) minerals are sensitive\
    \ to acidification."
  5: Increase in atmospheric CO2 leads to increased CO2 in surface ocean, declining
    seawater pH, and declining carbonate ion concentration.
  8: Ocean acidification and the complex combination of changing ocean conditions.
  13: Ocean acidification, worsened by enhanced coastal upwelling, decreasing harvests
    of bivalve shellfish species.
  14: Ocean acidification causing decreases in bivalve reproduction, survival, and
    maturation, potentially altering recruitment, harvestable biomass, maximum sustainable
    yield, and economic value of shellfish fisheries; ocean acidification and warming
    together decreasing shellfish biomass
  16: Ocean acidification, coastal disturbances such as trampling, sedimentation,
    dredging, and pollutants or poisons affect vermetid and shellfish reefs. Ocean
    acidification reduces biodiversity, decreasing ecosystem resilience and compromising
    regulating services like habitat provision, nutrient cycling, and carbon storage.
Highlights:
  3: Ocean acidification impacts from scientific, management, policy, and socioeconomic
    perspectives need to be understood to develop adequate adaptation strategies.
  5: The linked increase in atmospheric and surface ocean CO2, decline in seawater
    pH, and decline in carbonate ion concentration are presented.
  8: Ocean acidification is part of a complex of changing ocean conditions, making
    sensitivity studies challenging. Some studies find a signature of ocean acidification
    impacts on marine species, while many do not.
  13: Ocean acidification is very likely to decrease harvests of several bivalve shellfish
    species, with lost revenue and cultural disruption to follow.
  14: Ocean acidification poses a significant economic risk to shellfish fisheries,
    potentially leading to substantial losses in harvest value, welfare, and employment,
    comparable to hurricane damages in the US.
  16: Conservation and restoration of coastal systems to sequester carbon are being
    evaluated and promoted as part of overall carbon mitigation efforts, which may
    indirectly benefit ocean acidification. Loss of ocean biodiversity can decrease
    system productivity, stability and resiliency, and increase the risk of large-scale
    ecosystem shifts.
Methodology:
  3: This review focuses on the rapidly expanding body of knowledge on ocean acidification
    in the scientific literature over the past decade.
  5: "Calculated trends in surface ocean carbonate chemistry from observations obtained\
    \ at the Hawai'i Ocean Time-series (HOT) Program in the North Pacific during 1988\u2013\
    2015."
  8: Utilizes both a mechanistic, reductionist approach and a scenario-based approach
    to research the effects of ocean acidification and changing ocean conditions.
  14: Models with simple CO2-damage relationships for all bivalves and time discounting
    are used to project economic losses.
More Notes:
  5: The page focuses on ocean acidification and its impacts on marine organisms,
    particularly fish, which is an indirect link to the broader macroeconomic and
    macro-fiscal analysis, discussing how high CO2 conditions influence fish physiology
    (e.g., growth of otoliths, mitochondrial function, metabolic rate, larval yolk
    consumption, neurosensory processes, and behavior).

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: The paper mentions that ocean acidification potentially puts at risk many of
    the valuable ecosystem services that the ocean provides to society, such as fisheries,
    aquaculture, and shoreline protection.
  3: "The implications for human society\u2014for fishery and resource management,\
    \ marine conservation, and impacts on communities reliant on the ocean\u2014are\
    \ just now coming into focus. Improved understanding is urgently needed on ocean\
    \ acidification impacts from scientific, management, policy, and socioeconomic\
    \ perspectives to develop adequate adaptation strategies. Risks to human communities\
    \ that rely on the natural resources provided by the ocean via fisheries, aquaculture,\
    \ and cultural and social connections."
