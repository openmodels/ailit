Drivers of Risk:
  6: Natural disasters, climate change
  9: The direct effects of climate change, such as increased morbidity, reduced labour
    supply, and diminished agricultural yields.
  10: Frequency and intensity of natural hazards (NH), population exposed to disaster
    (P), level of resilience (R), human pressure on resources, choices made in economic
    development strategies, climate change increasing the intensity and frequency
    of NH
  11: Increase in climate change-related disasters such as droughts, floods, and extreme
    events influencing economic activity.
  14: Natural disasters (damage to buildings, crops, social infrastructure, lost output)
  15: Natural disasters create uncertainty and growth shocks leading to conflict risk;
    they reduce capital stock leading to GDP losses.
  16: Disasters (earthquakes, droughts)
  17: None
  24: In La Josefina, the landslide was caused by a combination of human and natural
    factors (permanent danger of landslide, dense rural population, land reforms dividing
    lands into small plots, farmers with little experience using overly intensive
    agriculture, monocultivation of maize in rows following the slope).
  27: Climate change exacerbates desertification, food insecurity, water scarcity,
    and related conflicts; population growth increases stress on water and food resources.
  33: Natural disasters; tendency of donor community to be reactive rather than proactive;
    delays or lack of coordination in aid; moral hazard; low density of weather watch
    stations.
  34: Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are highly exposed to natural hazards such as
    floods, droughts, and windstorms.
  35: Natural disasters and climate change.
  36: Natural disasters (various types and frequencies), climate change, conflict,
    population pressure, land degradation, desertification, choices countries make
    on economic development
  37: Africa is a very small contributor to the factors causing global warming and
    climate change, but is likely to be the continent most adversely affected.
Highlights:
  6: African governments need to develop a more robust adaptation and response capability
    to disasters as part of their overall development planning.
  9: Climate change can reduce annual productivity growth by 0.11 percentage points
    in the medium term without adaptation policies.
  10: Disasters are largely manmade; development and disasters are closely interlinked;
    climate change can affect vulnerability by increasing the intensity and frequency
    of natural hazards and increasing the affected population
  11: Africa's vulnerability to climate change impacts despite being a minor contributor;
    growing link between climate change and disasters; expected intensification of
    debate around these issues.
  14: Natural disasters have severe short-term consequences for the economy.
  15: Natural disasters can result in immediate GDP losses and potentially long-term
    capital stock reduction, influencing growth rates.
  16: Disasters can have varying long-term impacts on GDP per capita, ranging from
    a new lower equilibrium to technological change that enhances the long-term growth
    rate.
  17: None
  27: Desertification and water scarcity are severe issues in Africa, with significant
    socio-economic implications, including urban migration, reduced agricultural yields,
    and industrial threats due to water scarcity.
  33: International aid can minimize the long-term negative economic impact of natural
    disasters; debt relief can rapidly reduce financial pressure on disaster-stricken
    countries; ex ante conditionality in aid could reduce delays and moral hazard;
    investments in early warning systems can reduce the financial costs of disasters.
  34: "Development strategies that reduce people\u2019s vulnerability can help prevent\
    \ or reduce the frequency of natural disasters."
  35: Development is a key to long-term adaptation to climate change.
  36: Natural disasters have large costs to African development, sometimes larger
    than aid inflows; the intensity of disasters is determined by choices countries
    make on economic development; natural disasters should not be considered as one-off
    events
  37: Africa is likely to be the continent most adversely affected by climate change.
Methodology:
  6: Outlines a framework for thinking about the links among natural disasters, climate
    change, and economic development; argues for more forecasting research
  9: Developed a growth model to simulate the impact of climate change on productivity
    growth in the absence of adaptation policies.
  10: 'Conceptual framework expressing vulnerability (V) as a function of natural
    hazards (NH), population (P), and resilience (R): V = f(NH, P, R)'
  14: Economic linkage and substitution effects used to construct a macroeconomic
    model of the economic impact of a natural disaster.
  15: Recursive Keynesian growth models and the World Bank's model used to analyze
    disaster impacts on fiscal and growth outcomes.
  16: Conceptual scenarios are presented illustrating potential long-term GDP per
    capita impacts of disasters.
  17: None
More Notes:
  6: Argues for more market-based financing mechanisms and a new way of looking at
    disaster resilience as a continuum to development strategies.
  10: Vulnerability to natural hazards is decomposed into exposure to shocks and resilience.
    Conflict, security, and disasters are linked with pressure on resources leading
    to increased probability of conflict.
  14: 'There are conflicting theories about the long-term impact of natural disasters
    on growth: one suggests a temporary disruption with no long-term impact, while
    another argues for a negative impact due to resource diversion and opportunity
    costs.'
  16: Different types of disasters may lead to different long-term economic scenarios.
    The restitution of capital following some disasters (e.g., earthquakes) may lead
    to technological advancement. Droughts may have more limited long-term impacts
    unless they prompt major investments in mitigation.
  17: This page does not contribute original research or analysis directly assessing
    macroeconomic/fiscal impacts of climate change or adaptation at a national level,
    but reviews existing literature on natural disasters.
  35: In highly exposed countries, governments should prepare a clearly defined policy
    framework to meet urgent needs as well as to minimize the long-term negative consequences
    of disasters; Firm measures to strengthen adaptation include the integration of
    climate change impact in all national, subnational, and sectoral planning processes
    and macroeconomic projections.

  23: GDP per capita
  24: In Mozambique, the flood of 2000 killed 700 people, displaced 650,000, and affected
    4.5 million (a quarter of the population); Devastated 140,000 hectares of crops
    and irrigation systems; 350,000 livestock were lost or seriously injured; 6,000
    fishermen lost at least half of their boats and gear; and about 500 primary and
    7 secondary schools were destroyed.
  27: Desertification reduces agricultural and livestock yields, affecting land's
    capacity to support people, leading to urban migration; drought impacts industrial
    activity (as evidenced by electricity rationing in Ghana).
  33: Long-term economic effects due to high insurance costs diverting capital from
    investment or other spending; impact of debt service burden on crowding out other
    important uses of scarce resources.

Quantitative material:
  9: Model results suggest that without adaptation policies, annual productivity growth
    in the medium term is reduced by 0.11 percentage points.
  10: Costs of natural disasters between 1990 and 1999 surpassed US$650 billion in
    material losses (constant dollars), which is more than 15 times higher than the
    cost from 1950 to 1959
