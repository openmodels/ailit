Drivers of Risk:
  1: Natural disasters
  2: Natural disasters (unspecified types).
  4: Natural disasters (measured by the percentage of the population affected).
  5: Natural disasters (overall, biological, climatic, geophysical, hydrological,
    and meteorological).
  6: Natural disasters.
  8: Natural disasters (specifically, the number of people affected by disasters)
  10: Natural disasters (% Population Affected), lagged values of natural disasters.
  11: Natural disasters (climatic, hydrological, geophysical, meteorological, oceanic,
    or biological).
  13: Natural disasters (% Population Affected) - geophysical, hydrological, meteorological,
    biological, and combinations thereof.
  14: Biological disasters, Climatic disasters, Geophysical disasters, Hydrological
    disasters, Meteorological disasters, Disaster (% Population Affected), lagged
    values of Disaster (% Population Affected)
Highlights:
  2: Natural disasters decrease income inequality in per adult equivalent household
    income in Sri Lanka.
  4: Natural disasters affect a significant percentage of the population in Sri Lanka,
    and income inequality varies substantially across districts.
  5: There appears to be a significant negative correlation between disasters and
    income inequality, suggesting a possible reduction of income inequality by natural
    disasters.
  6: Natural disasters affect income inequality.
  8: Natural disasters have a statistically significant negative impact on income
    inequality, with effects observed for disasters occurring up to three years prior
    to the survey.
  10: Natural disasters and their immediate lags reduce income inequality as measured
    by the Theil index, Gini coefficient, and inter quintile range of average income.
    Lagged disasters in the previous year appear to significantly reduce inter quartile
    range of income. Current disasters significantly decrease income inequality measured
    by alternative inequality metrics when controls on access to safe water, hygienic
    facilities, structure of house and possession of movable properties are included.
  11: Natural disasters affect income of all quintiles. Current disasters negatively
    affect both the poorest and richest quintiles. Changes in income levels of different
    quintiles feed into changes in overall income inequality due to natural disasters.
  13: Contemporaneous natural disasters and their immediate lags decrease district-level
    income inequality as measured by the Theil index.
  14: Natural disasters lead to lesser income inequality. Reduction in income inequality
    was not derived through enhanced receipts or remittances. Natural disasters decreased
    non-seasonal agricultural income inequality and non-agricultural income inequality,
    but increased seasonal agricultural income inequality.
Methodology:
  1: Empirical analysis of the impact of natural disasters on income inequality.
  2: Panel fixed effects estimator using a unique panel dataset constructed for Sri
    Lanka, based on household income reported in six waves of the Household Income
    and Expenditure Survey of Sri Lanka during the period between 1990 and 2013, and
    data on disaster-affected population and other economic and social indicators.
    Ordinary Least Squares and System GMM are also used.
  4: Panel data analysis using household income and expenditure survey (HIES) data
    from 25 administrative districts in Sri Lanka across six survey time periods.
    The analysis examines the impact of natural disasters on income inequality at
    the district level. Income is equivalized using the OECD modified equivalence
    scale. Inequality is measured using Theil index, Gini coefficient, and inter-quartile
    range.
  5: Panel regression estimator with district and time fixed effects. Uses fixed effects
    estimator to control for time-invariant spatial heterogeneity and time-variant
    shocks.
  6: Panel fixed effect estimator, ordinary least squares (OLS), and System GMM are
    used. They check against omitted variable bias by adding more control variables.
    Regressions are rerun excluding the extreme survey waves, i.e., 2006/07 and 2009/10.
    They decompose inequality measured by Theil index into income components. The
    analysis considers the impact of lagged disasters.
  8: Panel data regression analysis using district-level inequality measures and disaster
    data with district and time fixed effects, clustering errors at the district level
    in Sri Lanka. Analysis uses data for six waves of surveys. Includes disaster lags
    up to five years.
  10: Panel data regression with district and time fixed effects, errors clustered
    at the district level, using data from 17 or 25 districts over six survey waves.
    OLS, difference and system GMM are used as further robustness checks.
  11: Panel data analysis with district and time fixed effects, using OLS and system
    GMM estimators. Difference GMM is also used. The analysis uses district-level
    inequality measures for multiple waves of surveys with corresponding disaster
    data. Different models exclude potentially outlier waves. The results are applicable
    to the specific panel dataset used in the study.
  13: Panel fixed effects estimator using district-level data for Sri Lanka across
    six survey periods (1990-2013). Models include district and time fixed effects,
    with errors clustered at the district level.
  14: Panel data analysis at the district level for six waves of surveys with contemporaneous
    and lagged disaster data. Models include district and time fixed effects with
    errors clustered at the district level.
More Notes:
  2: Natural disasters decrease non-seasonal agricultural and non-agricultural income
    inequality but increase seasonal agricultural income inequality; natural disasters
    do not affect household expenditure inequality.
  5: The data covers districts in Sri Lanka, but Jaffna, Kilinochchi and Mannar Districts
    were covered only in the last survey wave (2012/13).
  6: The data used is household income and expenditure survey data. Biological and
    meteorological disasters are also analyzed separately.
  8: After four years, non-agricultural income and receipts drive the positive impact
    on the Theil index (meaning increased income inequality).
  10: The paper checks for robustness by excluding specific survey waves (post-tsunami
    and post-civil war) and using alternative estimators to address potential simultaneity.
  11: No impact of natural disasters is found on expenditure inequality measures using
    panel fixed effects estimators.
  13: The study explores the impact of natural disasters on income inequality in Sri
    Lanka at the district level. Richer quintiles disproportionately bear direct disaster
    damages at a higher cost, but the poor can easily diversify their income sources
    after a natural disaster.
  14: The study focuses on Sri Lanka. Results should be read with caution; lower income
    inequality derived through higher damages to middle and richer quintiles does
    not reflect distributive justice.

Quantitative material:
  2: Contemporaneous natural disasters and their immediate lags significantly and
    substantially decrease inequality in per adult equivalent household income as
    measured by the Theil index.
  4: On average, disasters affect 5% of the population in a district per annum in
    Sri Lanka, with a maximum of 118% affected in a year (due to multiple disasters).
    District-wise income inequality measured by the Theil index is around 0.44, and
    the Gini coefficient is around 0.43. Per adult equivalent real mean household
    income is Rs. 8891 (in constant 2006 rupees). The income of the richest quintile
    is more than 10 times larger compared to the poorest quintile. Average household
    size is around 4, and about 15% of households are poor.
  5: Provides summary statistics (Obs, Mean, Std. Dev, Min, Max) for income inequality
    measures (Theil, Gini), income levels (Mean Household Income, Median Household
    Income, Income Quintiles), poverty measures (Head Count Index, % of Poor Households),
    household characteristics (Household Size, access to utilities), and disaster
    impacts (% of Population Affected).
  6: Table 2 provides mean income, median income, Theil index, Gini coefficient, IQ4R,
    and IQ5R for various districts in Sri Lanka.  The map visually represents the
    variation of mean inequality measured by the Theil index across districts.
  8: Statistically significant negative impact of natural disasters that occurred
    in the same year, two years and three years prior to the survey on income inequality
  10: Tables 6 and 8 present regression results showing the effect of disaster (%
    Population Affected) and its lags on income inequality metrics. Table 7 shows
    regression results with additional controls such as real median household income
    and HCI.
  11: Current natural disasters negatively affect mean household income. Disasters
    in the previous year negatively affect median household income. Income of the
    poorest quintile is reduced by current disasters and disasters occurring three
    years before. Income of the middle quintiles is reduced by disasters occurring
    in the previous year. Richest quintile's income is decreased by current disasters
    and disasters occurring two and three years before. Disaster (% Pop. Affected)
    has a statistically significant effect on income inequality measures (Theil, Gini,
    IQ5R). Disaster_lag2 has a statistically significant effect on income inequality
    measures (Theil)

    quintiles (logged). Table 17 shows the impact of disasters (excluding meteorological
    disasters) on income inequality (Theil).
