Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate warming results in more frequent and persistent natural hazards such
    as droughts.
  3: Changes in global drought conditions
  6: "Higher evaporative demands, more frequent and persistent dry spells associated\
    \ with rising temperatures, projected increases in dryness under 1.5 and 2.0\xB0\
    C warming conditions."
  7: Global temperature rise, specifically from 1.5 to 2.0 degrees Celsius warming,
    leading to increased drought frequency, duration, and severity.
  9: Increasing drought risks (more frequent historical 50-year events) driven by
    climate change and warming scenarios.
  10: "Increased drought duration and severity due to climate warming, specifically\
    \ the difference between 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming targets."
  11: "Climate warming, specifically increases of 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C, altering\
    \ drought frequency, duration, and severity."
  12: Increasing drought frequency and severity due to warming climates is identified
    as a major challenge for sustainable development.
  14: "More frequent severe droughts due to climate change under 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0\
    C warming targets; different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) influencing\
    \ exposure levels."
  15: "Changes in drought risks (magnitudes and spatial variability), warming scenarios\
    \ (1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C targets)."
  17: Increasing drought risks, magnitude of drought risk changes, population growth,
    and GDP growth.
  18: "Changes in drought duration and severity due to global warming (1.5\xB0C and\
    \ 2.0\xB0C warming levels)."
Highlights:
  1: "Limiting global warming to 1.5\xB0C can perceptibly mitigate drought impacts\
    \ over major regions compared with 2\xB0C warming."
  3: "Quantifies changes in global drought conditions and socioeconomic exposure (GDP)\
    \ with additional levels of 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warming under different SSPs (SSP1,\
    \ SSP2, SSP3, SSP4, and SSP5), using climate scenarios simulated by 13 CMIP5 global\
    \ climate models (GCMs) under three RCPs (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5)."
  6: Projected increases in drought severity and duration with warming; socioeconomic
    implications based on increased drought risks; urgent need to increase societal
    and environmental resilience in certain regions.
  7: Drought conditions become more extreme and frequent under warming climates, posing
    challenges for socio-hydrological systems.
  9: Large percentages of population and GDP will be exposed to increasing drought
    risks globally.
  10: "Limiting warming to 1.5\xB0C instead of 2\xB0C provides benefits, particularly\
    \ for mitigating population and GDP exposure to drought."
  11: Tropical regions (e.g., Mexico and Brazil) are projected to experience more
    severe and frequent droughts with worse socioeconomic influences compared to extratropical
    regions (e.g., Canada) under warming climates.
  12: "Substantial mitigation of future drought risks and corresponding socioeconomic\
    \ exposures can be achieved by limiting warming to 1.5\xB0C."
  14: The study projects the national population and GDP fraction exposed to more
    frequent severe droughts under different warming scenarios and SSPs.
  15: Aggravated drought risks are projected globally, with more significant increases
    over mid-latitudes and tropical regions. Tropical and mid-latitude regions, where
    the vast majority of the global population resides, would bear the greatest drought
    risks. Model agreement on projected changes is strong in certain regions, implying
    high confidence, while uncertainty is substantial in regions with small changing
    amplitudes.
  17: "The study strengthens the benefits and necessity of controlling global warming\
    \ at the 1.5\xB0C level due to the divergent impacts on local population and economy\
    \ at 2.0\xB0C."
  18: Drought severity and duration are projected to increase in a future warming
    world. There are variations in drought evolutions even at the same warming level
    due to the complex circulation system.
Methodology:
  1: Drought conditions and socioeconomic exposures are quantified using a bivariate
    framework with Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) projected
    by CMIP5 global climate models, evaluated under different warming scenarios.
  3: "A bivariate framework is used to quantify changes in global drought conditions\
    \ and socioeconomic exposure with 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warming. Drought characteristics\
    \ are identified using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index\
    \ (SPEI). Copula functions are used to model drought severity and duration. Drought\
    \ exposures of populations and regional GDP under different SSPs are assessed\
    \ globally."
  6: The analysis involves recalculating joint occurrence frequency of droughts under
    historical and future warming conditions, employing multi-model ensemble means,
    and considering different SSPs and RCPs to estimate socioeconomic exposures.
  9: "Drought projection is combined with population and GDP information based on\
    \ SSPs to estimate exposures in 1.5\u25E6C and 2.0\u25E6C warmer worlds. Nation-wide\
    \ population and GDP fraction is employed as the indicator."
  11: Spatially aggregating mean changes in drought return period relative to a historical
    50-year drought at a national scale. Land fractions of each grid cell are binned
    and plotted against the change in drought return period.
  12: "The study uses the reference crop Penman\u2013Monteith model to calculate potential\
    \ evapotranspiration and assesses drought conditions under various warming scenarios."
  14: "The study uses Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to project exposure of\
    \ population and GDP to more frequent severe droughts under different warming\
    \ scenarios (1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C)."
  15: Analysis of drought risks using the SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration
    Index) with thresholds of -0.5 and -0.8 to categorize drought severity. Joint
    return period deriving from the threshold of -0.8 is calculated. Assessment of
    socioeconomic exposures is based on drought risks and dynamic population and GDP
    pathways. Analysis is applicable to drought-prone countries and regions with significant
    drought projections.
  17: The study uses multi-model ensembles and RCP scenarios to quantify uncertainties.
    Bivariate return periods are used to analyze drought conditions.
  18: "The study quantifies changes in drought magnitude and socioeconomic consequences\
    \ (GDP exposure) in 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warmer worlds using climate projections\
    \ under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. Drought characteristics are identified using\
    \ the SPEI and run theory, with copula functions. The spatial resolution of population\
    \ and GDP is 0.5\xB0 x 0.5\xB0, upscaled to match GCM outputs (1\xB0 or 2\xB0\
    )."
More Notes:
  1: "More than 75 countries' populations and 73 countries' GDP will be affected by\
    \ increasing drought risks under 1.5\xB0C warming, with an additional 17 countries\
    \ affected at 2\xB0C."
  3: "The study employs spatially explicit global shared SSPs (gridded population\
    \ and GDP data) covering the period 2010\u20132100 at a spatial resolution of\
    \ 0.5\u25E6\xD70.5\u25E6. The SPEI with a 3-month timescale (SPEI-3) is used."
  9: The paper assesses the fraction of drought-affected population (or GDP) divided
    by total national population (or total GDP) to provide a fairer assessment of
    socioeconomic consequences.
  10: "There is spatial heterogeneity in drought exposure variations between 1.5\xB0\
    C and 2.0\xB0C warming, with some regions like Canada potentially seeing decreased\
    \ drought exposure at 2.0\xB0C compared to 1.5\xB0C. Focus on local scales is\
    \ important when assessing climate change impacts on extreme events."
  11: 'The analysis focuses on eight hotspot countries: Argentina, Australia, Canada,
    China, United States, South Africa, Brazil, and Mexico.'
  14: The figures (9 and 10) provide a visual representation of the distribution of
    risk across countries under different scenarios.
  15: The paper uses different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to project drought
    risks, with a focus on SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585 scenarios, whose probability
    distributions vary by country. Results are presented for Argentina, Australia,
    Canada, China, South Africa, United States, Brazil, and Mexico.
  17: Model uncertainty is relatively large, particularly for South America and Africa;
    the impact of dynamic population and GDP is considered in exposure calculations.
  18: "The study acknowledges uncertainties from GCM structure, RCPs, and internal\
    \ climate variability, but doesn't fully address them. The warming level is determined\
    \ by the multi-model ensemble mean, involving more future projections. Re-gridding\
    \ the data to a 2\xB0 grid confirms the reliability of the 1\xB0 resolution results."

    in regions like Mediterranean regions, South Africa, and South America.
  9: GDP exposure from increasing drought risks is analyzed.
  10: "GDP exposure to drought is projected to increase in several regions, with more\
    \ than 10 countries potentially experiencing a 30% increase in population and\
    \ GDP exposure if warming increases from 1.5 to 2.0\u25E6C."
  11: National populations and GDPs exposed to drought risk are used as a proxy for
    socioeconomic impacts.

  18: GDP exposure to drought is examined at the national level.
Quantitative material:
