Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global warming leading to more frequent and persistent droughts.
  3: The shocks impacting the outcomes are changes in drought characteristics identified
    using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), based on
    climate scenarios simulated by 13 CMIP5 global climate models under three RCPs
    (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5).
  4: The primary driver of risk is projected temperature increases under different
    RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) which impact drought.
  5: Changes in SPEI-3 (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) which
    is derived from precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET).
  6: Rising temperatures leading to higher evaporative demands and more frequent/persistent
    dry spells.
  7: "Global temperature rise, specifically from 1.5\xB0C to 2.0\xB0C warming; Changes\
    \ in SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index)"
  8: "Changes in the mean and standard deviation of the Standardized Precipitation\
    \ Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) are considered as drivers of drought risk. Different\
    \ warming levels (1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C) are also drivers."
  9: Increasing drought risks (more frequent historical 50-year events).
  10: "The primary driver of risk is global warming, specifically comparing the impacts\
    \ of 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming targets."
  11: "Climate warming, specifically 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming scenarios."
  12: Increasing precipitation and evaporative demand due to warming, potential evapotranspiration
    increases.
  13: Droughts, as indicated by a threshold on some index, are the driver of risk
    considered.
  14: Increased frequency of severe droughts under different warming scenarios and
    socioeconomic pathways considered as drivers of risk.
  15: Changes in drought risks as indicated by the 50-year joint return period are
    a driver of risk. Also, drought risk changes are analyzed for 20- and 100-year
    drought events.
  16: "Drought risks increasing under different warming levels (1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0\
    C warming targets)"
  17: Increasing drought risks measured by changes in SPEI-3 (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration
    Index), and uncertainty induced by GCMs and RCP scenarios.
  18: Changes in drought duration and severity, evaluated using the SPEI combined
    with run theory and copula functions.
  20: Droughts are the primary driver of risk discussed.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Socioeconomic exposure to droughts, including population and regional gross domestic
    product (GDP).
  3: "The study quantifies changes in global drought conditions and socioeconomic\
    \ exposure with additional levels of 1.5 and 2.0\xB0C warming, specifically assessing\
    \ the drought exposures of populations and regional gross domestic product (GDP)\
    \ under different SSPs globally."
  4: The paper evaluates projected increases in the magnitude and socioeconomic exposure
    of global droughts (from title).
  6: "The paper evaluates drought conditions and socioeconomic exposure to drought\
    \ under 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming scenarios."
  7: Drought conditions, including drought frequency, duration, and severity
  8: Drought risks are evaluated through changes in drought severity and duration.
  9: "Population and GDP exposure to increasing drought risks (defined as more frequent\
    \ historical 50-year events) in 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warmer worlds."
  10: The paper evaluates the projected changes in drought duration and severity,
    and socioeconomic exposure (population and GDP) to drought.
  11: Socioeconomic exposure to drought risks, including impacts on national populations
    and GDPs.
  12: Drought risks and corresponding socioeconomic exposures.
  13: No relevant information
  14: The page provides an overview of population and GDP exposure to more frequent
    severe droughts under different warming targets and socioeconomic pathways.
  15: Drought risks and socioeconomic exposures to drought are evaluated.
  16: Socioeconomic exposure to drought
  17: "Evaluates drought risk, affected population, and affected GDP under 1.5\xB0\
    C and 2.0\xB0C warming scenarios."
  18: "Global drought magnitude and socioeconomic consequences in 1.5 and 2.0\xB0\
    C warmer worlds"
  20: The paper focuses on projected increases in the magnitude and socioeconomic
    exposure of global droughts.
Highlights:
  1: "Limiting global warming to 1.5\xB0C, compared with 2\xB0C warming, can perceptibly\
    \ mitigate drought impacts over major regions of the world."
  3: The study systematically investigates changes in the bivariate return period
    with global warming, and assesses the drought exposures of populations and regional
    GDP under different SSPs.
  4: "The paper projects future temperature changes under different emissions pathways\
    \ (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) to assess when global mean temperatures reach 1.5\xB0\
    C and 2.0\xB0C warming."
  5: The paper aims to evaluate the change in drought occurrence frequency in a bivariate
    context (duration and severity) under warmer conditions and to calculate the socioeconomic
    exposures by droughts in different warming environments.
  6: Dryness is projected to intensify globally in a warmer world. Drought duration
    and severity are projected to increase, especially in Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean,
    southern Africa, southern North America, and South America. Short, intense bursts
    of drought are projected in the tropics and high-latitude areas.
  7: "The world will experience more severe drought conditions with further warming\
    \ from 1.5 to 2.0\xB0C. Drought severity increases more rapidly than drought duration.\
    \ Extreme drought conditions are projected to occur more frequently under warming\
    \ climates. Certain regions like Mediterranean regions, South Africa, and South\
    \ America are particularly vulnerable"
  8: Most areas of South America (except around the Equator), northeastern America,
    central and western Asia, and Northwest China are projected to experience historical
    50-year droughts 2 to 10 times more frequently.
  9: Globally, three SSPs suggest a consistent projection that large percentages of
    population and GDP will be exposed to increasing drought risks. The most drought-affected
    countries are presented by high fractions of drought-affected population or GDP.
  10: "Limiting warming to 1.5\xB0C instead of 2\xB0C would reduce drought risk in\
    \ many regions. Some regions, like Canada, may experience slightly decreased drought\
    \ exposure at 2.0\xB0C compared to 1.5\xB0C due to decreasing land fraction exposure\
    \ to more frequent droughts. Mexico, southern Europe, central and southern Africa,\
    \ and the Mediterranean regions are projected to experience more severe drought."
  11: "Drought risks are projected to increase significantly in hotspot countries,\
    \ particularly in tropical regions like Mexico and Brazil, under 1.5\xB0C and\
    \ 2.0\xB0C warming scenarios. The tropics may confront more severe and frequent\
    \ droughts. Increasing drought risks are more profound in tropical regions than\
    \ in high-latitude country."
  12: "Limiting warming to 1.5\xB0C would substantially mitigate future drought risks\
    \ and corresponding socioeconomic exposures. Climate warming is expected to lead\
    \ to a general intensification of drought conditions."
  13: No relevant information
  14: Projections indicate increased exposure of population and GDP to more frequent
    severe droughts under various warming targets and socioeconomic pathways.
  15: Aggravated drought risks are projected globally, with larger increases in mid-latitudes
    and tropical regions. Regions like the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and southern
    North America are highlighted as having large projected changes.
  16: "Drought risks and population (GDP) both contribute to the exposure change.\
    \ Under the 1.5\xB0C warming climate, there are around 88% of global landmasses\
    \ being exposed to increasing drought risks."
  17: "Controlling global warming at the 1.5\xB0C level is beneficial and necessary.\
    \ Model uncertainty is large, especially for South America and Africa."
  18: "The means of SPEI-3 are projected to descend at a global scale in 1.5 and 2.0\xB0\
    C warmer worlds, while the standard deviation exhibits large increases. The distribution\
    \ of SPEI-3 would shift towards the negative side, implying a more severe drying\
    \ condition."
Methodology:
  1: Uses the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) combined
    with the run theory, climate scenarios from 13 CMIP5 GCMs under RCP 2.6, RCP4.5
    and RCP8.5. Copula functions are used to model the joint distribution of drought
    severity and duration.
  2: The paper discusses different approaches to selecting variable combinations in
    a multivariate framework, including the equivalent frequency combination (EFC)
    method and the 'most likely design realization' approach.
  3: "The analysis uses the SPEI combined with run theory and climate scenarios from\
    \ 13 CMIP5 GCMs under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. Copula functions model drought\
    \ severity and duration concurrently. Population and GDP data under five SSPs,\
    \ covering the period 2010\u20132100 at a spatial resolution of 0.5\xB0\xD70.5\xB0\
    , are used to assess drought exposures."
  4: The paper uses 13 GCMs (listed in Table 1) to project future temperatures. Potential
    evapotranspiration (PET) is calculated using the Penman-Monteith approach. The
    methodology is applicable for projecting future drought conditions based on temperature
    projections from GCMs and PET calculations.
  5: This study jointly models drought duration (D) and severity (S) via the copula
    function, using the Gamma distribution for drought variables and the Gumbel copula
    to model the joint distribution. The most likely realization method is used to
    choose the drought scenario with the highest likelihood along the Tor-level isoline.
  6: "The analysis uses the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI-3)\
    \ to assess dryness. It recalculates joint occurrence frequencies of drought events\
    \ under 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming conditions based on historical 50-year bivariate\
    \ quantiles. Socioeconomic exposure is evaluated by recording population and GDP\
    \ in areas with more severe drought, using SSPs. The analysis uses multi-model\
    \ ensemble means to reduce model bias, considering three RCPs and corresponding\
    \ SSPs. The results are applicable to 30-year periods determined by different\
    \ warming levels."
  7: "Analysis uses multi-model ensemble mean results to project drought characteristics\
    \ (frequency, duration, severity) under different warming scenarios (historical,\
    \ 1.5\xB0C, 2.0\xB0C); Violin plots are used to display the probability distribution\
    \ of drought characteristics across all land pixels"
  8: A copula-based approach is used to assess drought severity and duration under
    different warming levels, focusing on changes in the historical 50-year drought
    conditions.
  9: Combines drought projections with population and GDP information based on SSPs
    to estimate exposures by droughts. Uses nation-wide population (and GDP) fraction
    instead of absolute value.
  10: "The analysis compares drought duration, severity, and socioeconomic exposure\
    \ under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and warming levels (1.5\xB0\
    C and 2.0\xB0C)."
  11: Spatially aggregating mean changes in drought return period relative to historical
    50-year drought for different land fractions in eight countries. Land fractions
    of each grid cell are binned and plotted against the change in drought return
    period. Distributions for drought characteristics are analyzed under different
    time periods.
  12: Climate models, Penman-Monteith model for potential evapotranspiration, SPEI-3.
  13: The study employs the run theory with a threshold of -0.5 to identify drought
    events. A fixed rs method is used to calculate potential evapotranspiration. The
    robustness is tested by using a threshold of -0.8. Bivariate frequency analysis
    is used.
  15: Drought risks are calculated using different thresholds (-0.5 and -0.8) for
    the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Socioeconomic
    exposures are based on drought risk variations and dynamic population/GDP pathways.
    The Return Period (RP) of a 50-year event is calculated under SSP126, SSP245,
    and SSP585 scenarios. Histograms compare the change in Return Periods across eight
    countries.
  16: "Dynamic characteristics are considered differences in population (and GDP)\
    \ between the fixed 30-year 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warming periods. The exposure is\
    \ defined as the number of people (GDP) being exposed to areas where the bivariate\
    \ drought risks increase under the warming climate."
  17: Uses multi-model ensembles to quantify changes in SPEI-3 under three RCPs. Bivariate
    return period of present 50-year drought condition for each model under RCP4.5
    is presented.
  18: "Uses multi-model ensemble under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 to project climate\
    \ and SPEI to identify drought characteristics. Analysis applies to 1.5\xB0C and\
    \ 2.0\xB0C warmer worlds."
  20: The page is a list of references; the methodology would be in the body of the
    paper. The paper seems to consider socioeconomic pathways in its analysis.
More Notes:
  1: Focuses on the multifaceted nature of droughts (severity and duration) using
    a bivariate framework.
  2: The paper highlights the limitations of univariate drought analysis and the need
    to consider the interdependence of drought characteristics for a comprehensive
    global impact assessment under different warming levels.
  3: The study employs spatially explicit global shared SSPs instead of a static socioeconomic
    scenario. The SPEI with a 3-month timescale (SPEI-3) is used.
  4: Table 1 lists the GCMs used in the study, including their resolution and institution.
    The equations for calculating PET and related variables are also provided.
  9: "Economically prosperous regions are associated with higher population and immigration,\
    \ so the drought-affected GDP exposures usually exhibit similar changing patterns\
    \ with the population. The paper considers drought impacts can be fatal and destructive\
    \ for countries with low GDP and population density and poor drought resilience,\
    \ even if total socioeconomic exposures seem small. Fraction of drought-affected\
    \ population or GDP is used to give a fairer and more impartial assessment of\
    \ droughts\u2019 socioeconomic consequences."
  10: "The paper notes spatial heterogeneity in drought exposure variations when warming\
    \ climbs from 1.5 to 2.0\xB0C."
  11: The increase in drought risks over tropical countries may be attributed to oceanic
    forcing that favors the formation of deep convection over the ocean and thus weakened
    the continental convergence associated with the monsoon.
  13: The paper acknowledges that neglecting increasing rs (stomatal resistance) may
    overestimate future drying conditions. The impact of rs on drought assessments
    deserves further study but is beyond the scope of this study.
  15: Model agreement is generally strong for drought-prone areas but substantial
    model uncertainty exists in regions with small changing amplitudes. Drought characteristics
    tend to slightly decrease across different periods. The vast majority of the global
    population resides in tropical and mid-latitude regions that would bear the greatest
    drought risks.
  16: "Figures 13 and 14 display distributions for drought characteristics and projected\
    \ changes in joint 50-year return periods of droughts, respectively. Figure 13\
    \ uses -0.5 and -0.8 as thresholds, and Figure 14 uses -0.5 and -0.8 as the threshold\
    \ under the 1.5\u25E6C warming target."
Quantitative material:
  1: "Historical 50-year droughts may double across 58% of global landmasses in a\
    \ 1.5\xB0C warmer world. An additional 9% of world landmasses would be exposed\
    \ to catastrophic drought deteriorations at 2.0\xB0C warming."
  3: "The study uses 1.5 and 2.0\xB0C warming levels above pre-industrial conditions,\
    \ relative to a baseline period of 1976-2005 (0.51\xB0C warmer than pre-industrial)."

    \ under the half-degree additional warming (2.0\xB0C vs. 1.5\xB0C) accounts for\
    \ 71% of continental areas."
  9: "In more than 67 (140) countries, 100% (50%) of both populations and GDPs are\
    \ exposed to more severe droughts under the 1.5\u25E6C warming target."
  10: "The paper projects percentage changes in drought duration and severity, as\
    \ well as the fraction of population and GDP exposed to drought under different\
    \ warming scenarios and SSPs. It mentions that under an extra half-degree warming,\
    \ an additional 17 countries are projected to exhibit a 100% fraction in socioeconomic\
    \ exposure, and more than 10 countries would experience a 30% increase in population\
    \ and GDP exposure. It also gives an example where the land fraction suffering\
    \ more frequent severe droughts in Canada will decrease (\u221212.77%) in the\
    \ 2.0\xB0C warming level compared to 1.5\xB0C warming under the SSP126 scenario."
  11: "In a 1.5\xB0C warming world, more than 85% of the grid cells (associated with\
    \ around 65%\u201397% of the national populations and GDPs) over Mexico and Brazil\
    \ could be exposed to the historical 50-year drought every 20 years."
  12: "More than 90% of grid cells (associated with around 90%\u2013100% of the national\
    \ population and GDP) across Brazil and Mexico will experience drought frequency\
    \ double that of the historical 50-year drought."
  13: "The study projects changes in joint 50-year return periods of droughts between\
    \ the 1.5 and 2.0\xB0C warming targets."
  14: Maps depict fractional changes in population and GDP exposure to droughts using
    a color scale, with specific percentages represented through color gradients.
  15: "Projected changes in drought risks are presented. Figures 11 and 12 show projected\
    \ changes in drought risks for eight typical drought-prone countries under 1.5\xB0\
    C and 2.0\xB0C warming targets, respectively. Figures S5 and S6 show changes in\
    \ drought risks for the 20-year and 100-year drought events. 100% of the population\
    \ in tropical regions like Brazil and Mexico would be affected by increasing drought\
    \ risks."
  16: "Around 88% of global landmasses being exposed to increasing drought risks under\

  17: "At 2.0\xB0C warming, affected population soars to 1538.2 million and USD72852.2\
    \ billion in GDP. Drought risks will double across around 58% of global landmasses\
