Drivers of Risk:
  3: Meteorological variables during the cold period (CP), including temperature (mean,
    min, max, delta), precipitation, wind velocity, solar radiation, vapor pressure
    deficit, and evapotranspiration.
  4: Meteorological variables are the drivers of risk. Table 3 lists meteorological
    variables during the cold period including days, temperature, and precipitation.
  5: Meteorological variables like cold temperatures, extreme temperature counts,
    and wind chill impact the survival clusters.
  6: "Meteorological survival clusters (poor, medium, high) based on simulation of\
    \ cold period (CP, mean temperature below 0\xB0C). Essentially, cold stress during\
    \ winter."
  7: "Meteorological variables such as Colder (5 days), ncycle (24 cycles), cET (465\
    \ mm cumulative ET), meanWindchill (-3.6\u25E6C), Colder_pct (3%), and maxTmean\
    \ (13.4\u25E6C) are identified as relevant drivers of winter canola survival."

Evaluation overview:
  3: Winter survival of canola, measured as the percentage of plants alive in spring
    relative to those present before winter.
  4: Survival of canola germplasm is the outcome being evaluated, specifically its
    risk level.
  5: The analysis evaluates meteorological survival clusters of canola based on cold
    periods.
  6: Winter survival of canola genotypes
  7: Winter canola survival is evaluated, ranging from 0 to 100%.

Highlights:
  3: The study identifies meteorological variables that characterize winter harshness
    and impact canola winter survival.
  4: The analysis predicts meteorological survival class based on meteorological covariates
    and estimates the area of adaptation of canola germplasm based on survival risk,
    using long-term weather data.
  5: The decision tree identifies distinct clusters of canola survival based on meteorological
    conditions, with geographic variation across the U.S.
  6: Genotype by environment interaction (GxE) is an important determinant of canola
    winter survival, but the environment (E) has a much larger effect.
  7: 'Four different genotype-specific behaviors were identified: tolerant, semi-tolerant,
    semi-susceptible, and susceptible, with varying survival rates depending on the
    meteorological survival cluster (poor, medium, high).'

Methodology:
  3: Daily weather data from Google Climate Engine (1979-2019) is used to calculate
    secondary weather variables and identify the cold period (CP). Statistical analyses
    are performed to estimate the contribution of genotype, environment, and their
    interaction to canola winter survival.
  4: A multi-step process is used to model and predict canola survival based on meteorological
    variables. This includes random-effect models, mixed models, cluster analysis
    of environment BLUEs for survival, conditional inference tree methodology, and
    integrating meteorological survival class with meteorological predictors. Step
    5 utilizes long-term daily weather records (1979-2019) to estimate area of adaptation.
  5: Analysis is performed using a conditional inference tree leveraging meteorological
    variables from cold periods across 190 site-years.
  6: Mixed-effect models were used to analyze winter survival data, accounting for
    genotype, meteorological survival cluster, and their interaction. Tree models
    and cluster analyses were also employed. Analyses were conducted within the R
    framework using lme4, partykit, and stats packages.
  7: A conditional inference tree was used to classify site-year cold periods into
    meteorological survival clusters based on meteorological variables, using data
    from 94 sites during 1979-2019.

More Notes:
  3: "The cold period (CP) is defined as the period when temperatures are below 0\xB0\
    C. Windchill is calculated using a specific formula. A log transformation is applied\
    \ to the winter survival data due to its non-normal distribution."
  4: The modeling approach focuses on the cold period's impact on survival. The paper
    uses a conditional inference tree method with hyperparameters (maximum depth and
    alpha) tuned via leave-one-out cross-validation.
  6: The study identified four distinct genotype survival groups (tolerant, semi-tolerant,
    semi-susceptible, and susceptible).
  7: The map displays the distribution of each genotype survival group across the
    US based on the National Winter Canola Variety Trial sites.
  9: This page is an appendix listing crop genotype groups, their names, decade of
    release, and type (open-pollinated or hybrid). It does not contain information
    directly relevant to assessing climate impacts for the National Climate Assessment
    but could be part of a larger study.
  10: This page is a table listing different genotypes of crops, their decade of release,
    and whether they are open-pollinated or hybrid. It does not provide information
    on climate impacts, risk drivers, or quantitative results. Therefore, there is
    no relevant information for most categories.
Quantitative material:
  3: Includes counts and percentages of days within specific temperature and temperature
    difference ranges during the cold period. Also includes minimum, mean, and maximum
    values for temperature and temperature difference. Cumulative values for precipitation,
    evapotranspiration, solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and growing degree
    days are also calculated.
  4: Table 3 provides summary statistics (minimum, mean, median, maximum, and coefficient
    of variation) for meteorological variables related to canola survival during the
    cold period.
  5: Node and leaf bar plots in the decision tree classify survival as high, medium,
    or poor with specific thresholds for variables.
  6: G, E and GxE explained 3%, 71%, and 7% of the variation in winter canola survival,
    respectively. The rest of the variation was pooled into model residuals (19%).
    Survival percentages of different genotypes across meteorological survival clusters
    are shown in figures.
  7: Tolerant genotype survival group had a significant greater survival (40%) in
    the poor meteorological survival cluster.
