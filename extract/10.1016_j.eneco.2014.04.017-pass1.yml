Drivers of Risk:
  5: Changes in the distribution of outdoor temperature (F0), other climate variables
    (e.g., humidity)
  6: "Changes in the probability distribution of experiencing temperature (f(t) changing\
    \ from F0(t) to F\u03C4(t) due to climate change)."
  8: Global warming/Climate change (warmer summers and winters).
  12: Temperature fluctuations, specifically very cold and hot days, impacting electricity
    consumption.
  13: Weather shocks, temperature changes
  16: Cooling Degree Days (CDDs) as a result of climate change.
  18: Predicted shifts in climate for EU member countries and the relatively high
    incomes.
  20: Cooling degree days (CDD), income levels.
  21: Climate affects energy consumption via short-run weather shocks (intensive margin)
    and long-run adaptation through changing durable goods (extensive margin).
  29: Temperature changes (implied)
Highlights:
  6: Climate change alters the distribution of temperatures, affecting energy expenditures
    needed to maintain desired indoor temperatures. Welfare effects of climate change
    can be measured by changes in these expenditures, considering both the cost of
    energy and adjustments in durable goods. Panel data provides better estimates
    of this effect.
  8: Global warming will result in fuel switching in the United States with more homes
    heating with electricity. Warmer summers result in more electricity and oil consumption,
    while warmer winters will result in less natural gas consumption for households.
    Commercial firms are expected to increase electricity consumption and decrease
    oil consumption as temperatures increase.
  9: Cross-sectional approaches may be biased due to unobservable differences and
    non-random sorting. Time-series approaches offer an alternative to assess weather's
    impact on energy consumption.
  12: The study finds a U-shaped response function where electricity consumption is
    higher on very cold and hot days.
  13: Panel data is the most promising method for estimating the effect of weather
    on energy expenditures.
  16: "Ignoring the adoption decision of air conditioners would lead to an underestimation\
    \ of future electricity consumption. Higher CDDs lead to increased adoption of\
    \ air conditioners and higher use. Adding the extensive margin adjustment results\
    \ in increases that are signi\uFB01cant and matter when making forecasts. Technological\
    \ progress and uncertainty in durable goods efficiency play a role in consumer\
    \ decisions."
  20: Air conditioner adoption is climate-dependent and income-dependent. Adoption
    rates are low in many developing countries but rise significantly at income levels
    of $25,000.
  21: Understanding of air conditioner penetration by country is limited, making projections
    of future penetration under different climate, income and price scenarios a challenging
    but important task.
  29: Temperature slope coefficients are estimated for different climate zones, represented
    by a representative city for that climate zone.
Methodology:
  5: Theoretical model of household utility maximization subject to budget constraints,
    considering energy prices, durables prices, and temperature distribution
  6: "The paper proposes using changes in energy expenditures as a proxy for the welfare\
    \ effects of climate change. It distinguishes between a comprehensive measure\
    \ (\u2206W) considering changes in both energy and durables and an intensive margin\
    \ measure (\u2202W/\u2202t) focusing on the immediate impact of temperature changes\
    \ on energy expenditures. Panel data estimates are highlighted as preferable to\
    \ time series data for estimating the effect of temperature on energy expenditure."
  8: Discrete-continuous choice model where fuel choice is endogenous to climate change.
    The first step estimates a multinomial logit model, and the second equation is
    of conditional demand.
  9: The paper discusses and critiques cross-sectional and time-series approaches
    to analyzing the effects of weather and climate on energy consumption. Cross-sectional
    studies are criticized for potential omitted variable bias due to non-random sorting
    of households into different climate zones and the assumption that the year of
    the sample reflects long-run expectations. Time-series studies, specifically univariate
    time-series data, are discussed as an alternative, with examples focusing on electricity
    load and energy demand.
  12: The study uses state and census division fixed effects and flexible functions
    of precipitation, population, and income to model log consumption with temperature
    data entering as the number of days in a temperature bin.
  13: Panel data estimation of the effect of weather on energy expenditures, estimating
    separate models for each climate zone. Could be improved by understanding the
    likelihood of relevant weather events in a given climate zone.
  16: Estimates a relationship between saturation and cooling degree days using an
    equation, and also estimates an equation between state per capita electricity
    consumption and CDDs, HDDs, and wind speed. Another study estimates a discrete-time,
    infinite horizon dynamic consumer optimization problem.
  18: Uses cross sectional US data to parameterize relationships which determine climate
    dependent saturation levels in other countries.
  20: Cross-sectional regression analysis using appliance penetration data (mostly
    from the World Bank's LSMS database) and cooling degree days (CDD). First, a relationship
    between climate maximum (saturation level) and CDD is estimated using US city
    data. This is then used to predict saturation levels for developing countries.
    Air conditioner diffusion is modeled as a function of income, conditional on the
    climate maximum.
  29: Estimation of temperature slope coefficients using percentile and equidistant
    temperature bins, normalized to the 60-65 temperature bin coefficient.
More Notes:
  6: The paper acknowledges several caveats to its welfare measure, including price
    responses to climate change, transition costs, discounting of future costs, exclusion
    of direct utility effects of climate, and the possibility of relocation. The analysis
    focuses on the household level.
  9: The paper highlights the potential for bias in cross-sectional studies when assessing
    the effects of climate change on energy-related outcomes, suggesting caution in
    their application without a better understanding of the magnitude of the bias.
  13: The paper focuses on short-run responses to weather and does not address long-run
    adaptation. The data is only for California and may not be representative of other
    regions or countries. There is a need for more research on how building characteristics
    (air conditioning, fuel choice, insulation) vary with climate.
  16: One study's relationship between saturation and cooling degree days does not
    control for observables like income and lacks standard errors, limiting its robustness.
  18: Data on air conditioner usage and adoption in Europe are scarce.
  19: The page discusses the potential for increased energy demand in Europe due to
    climate change driving increased air conditioner use. It does not explicitly discuss
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes or adaptation costs/benefits but rather frames
    the issue as one of changing energy consumption patterns, particularly peak demand,
    and the need for better data collection and analysis.
  20: The analysis uses a climate-dependent saturation level (Climate Maximum) based
    on US data as a frontier for developing country adoption.
  21: The paper reviews literature on the relationship between climate and the energy
    sector, focusing on empirical papers published in peer-reviewed economics journals
    on how climate affects energy expenditures.
  29: This page references Auffhammer and Aroonruengsawat (forthcoming), suggesting
    a replication of their analysis. The normalization to the 60-65 temperature bin
    likely serves as a baseline or comparison point across climate zones.

  15: This page primarily discusses air conditioning adoption in the US and does not
    directly address the macroeconomic or macro-fiscal impacts of climate change or
    adaptation at a national level.

  16: Los Angeles' per capita residential electricity consumption is projected to
    increase by eight percent in July for a 20 percent increase in CDD, compared to
    a five percent increase if market saturation were assumed to remain constant.
  20: Explains 70 percent of the variation in the transformed dependent variable (log(Climate
    Maximum/Saturation -1)) with a regression based on 24 observations. Air conditioner
    penetration rates are very low and clustered around zero for a number of countries.
    At income levels of $25,000 the adoption rates seem to rise drastically.
