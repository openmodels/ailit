Drivers of Risk:
  1: Maintaining ambition as reflected in current NDCs up to 2100 and beyond; Incremental
    NDC improvements.
  4: Temperature changes leading to economic damages.
  5: Temperature increase, specifically in tropical regions, causes economic damages.
  7: Climate change impacts including sea-level rise and temperature increases are
    the drivers of risk.
  8: "Changes in hot extremes (TXx), different scenarios of global mean temperature\
    \ (GMT) increase (no change in current NDCs, BE33 scenario resembling a 33% change\
    \ in NDCs of big emitters, and a 1.5\xB0C pathway)"
Highlights:
  1: Incremental improvements in reduction targets, even if achieved globally, are
    insufficient to align collective ambition with the goals of the Paris Agreement;
    A transformational increase in 2030 ambition is required to achieve the goals
    of the Paris Agreement and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
  4: "Illustrates the relevance of temperature changes on economic damages using three\
    \ climate pathways (current NDCs, BE33, and a 1.5\u25E6C pathway) with respect\
    \ to a counterfactual with no climate change."
  5: "The importance of comparable levels of action by all emitters to achieve the\
    \ Paris Agreement\u2019s goals; larger emission reductions can significantly reduce\
    \ global warming and economic damages."
  7: "Current NDC trajectories imply substantial additional impacts, and even a 33%\
    \ increase in ambition by big emitters only reduces about half the inferred impacts\
    \ compared to limiting warming to 1.5\xB0C."
  8: GDP per capita tends to show a decline under climate change scenarios for Latin
    America, LDCs, SIDS, and South Asia. The impacts are more pronounced by the end
    of the century (2100) than mid-century (2050).
Methodology:
  1: "Assessment of different scenarios of NDC updating that fall short of achieving\
    \ the 1.5\u25E6C benchmark; projection of GDP reduction based on current NDCs\
    \ up to 2100 and beyond."
  4: Economic damages are calculated based on the methodology by Burke et al. (2018).
    This combines historical relationships between GDP growth and temperature variability
    and projects future temperature changes using the specified climate pathways.
  7: "The analysis compares climate impacts under different scenarios of mitigation\
    \ ambition, including NDC reference, a 33% ambition increase for big emitters,\
    \ and a 1.5\xB0C scenario."
  8: The analysis uses different GCMs (Global Climate Models) to estimate economic
    damages under different temperature pathways. The estimates are given for mid-century
    (2046-2065) and end of century (2081-2100).
More Notes:
  1: The paper also mentions climate impacts such as extreme temperature and long-term
    sea-level rise in addition to economic damages.
  2: This page focuses primarily on mitigation, rather than adaptation, and its economic
    impact analysis seems to be limited to referencing existing literature.
  5: Sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and non-linear trends are not considered
    in the economic damages model but are expected to exacerbate economic impacts.
  7: The paper emphasizes the importance of increased ambition from all countries
    to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, not just big emitters.
  8: The definition of the BE33 scenario is 'resembling a 33% change in NDCs of big
    emitters'.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) in tropical countries.
  4: Economic damages expressed in terms of the gross domestic product (GDP).
  5: Estimated median reduction in GDP per capita around 2050 ranges from 11% to 20%
    across different climate pathways.
  7: Median GDP reductions for LDCs relative to a no-climate-change scenario are presented.
  8: GDP per capita change relative to a no-climate-change scenario
Quantitative material:
  1: "Under the assumption of maintaining ambition as reflected in current NDCs up\
    \ to 2100 and beyond, a reduction in the gross domestic product (GDP) in tropical\
    \ countries of around 60% compared to a no-climate-change scenario is projected;\
    \ Median long-term sea-level rise of close to 2m in 2300; An increase in aggregated\
    \ NDC ambition of big emitters by 33% in 2030 does not reduce presented climate\
    \ impacts by more than about half compared to limiting warming to 1.5\u25E6C."
  4: "GDP is estimated at the degrees of warming reached with current NDCs, BE33,\
    \ and a 1.5\u25E6C pathway and then compared to the GDP in a counterfactual scenario\
    \ without climate change. The impacts are calculated for midcentury (2046\u2013\
    2065) and end of century (2081\u20132100)."
  5: "Reduction in GDP per capita is 11%-14% for 1.5\xB0C pathway, 14%-17% for the\
    \ BE33 scenario, and 17%-20% for the baseline pathway of current NDCs around 2050;\
    \ projections range from 29%-50% by 2100."
  7: "Median GDP reductions for LDCs in 2050 are -20% (NDC), -17% (33% ambition increase),\
    \ and -14% (1.5\xB0C scenario). In 2100, the reductions are -66% (NDC), -50% (33%\
    \ ambition increase), and -34% (1.5\xB0C scenario)."
  8: "Percentage difference between GDP per capita under selected temperature pathways\
    \ and GDP per capita under a no-climate-change scenario, presented as boxplots\
    \ showing estimates for different GCMs for mid-century (2046\u20132065) and end-of-century\
    \ (2081\u20132100)"
