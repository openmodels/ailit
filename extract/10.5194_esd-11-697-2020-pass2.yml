Drivers of Risk:
  1: Incremental NDC improvements, maintenance of current NDC ambition, global mean
    temperature increase.
  2: Global mean temperature increase
  3: No relevant information
  4: The drivers of risk include temperature trajectories, specifically focusing on
    global mean temperature increases. Sea-level rise is driven by thermal expansion,
    glacier mass loss, and ice sheet contributions. Extreme hot days are driven by
    changes in the intensity of the hottest day in a year (TXx). Economic damages
    are driven by projected future temperature changes.
  5: Hottest day in a year (TXx)
  6: The primary driver of risk is greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2 equivalent
    emissions, which directly influence global mean temperature increases.
  7: "Different scenarios of mitigation ambition (NDC reference scenario, 33% ambition\
    \ increase for big emitters, and a 1.5\u25E6C scenario) influence sea level rise,\
    \ temperature increases, and GDP reductions."
  8: "Changes in hot extremes (TXx), different scenarios of global mean temperature\
    \ (GMT) increase (NDC, BE33, 1.5\xB0C pathway)."
  9: Temperature extremes
Evaluation overview:
  1: Climate impacts under median scenarios for extreme temperature, long-term sea-level
    rise, and economic damages for the most vulnerable countries.
  2: Sea-level rise, extreme temperatures and economic damages
  3: No relevant information
  4: The paper evaluates long-term sea-level rise, extreme hot days (TXx), and economic
    damages (GDP loss).
  5: Extreme temperature; Economic damages
  6: No relevant information
  7: Global mean sea-level rise, annual maximum temperature (TXx) increase, and GDP
    reductions for Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
  8: Economic damages, measured as percentage difference in GDP per capita under different
    temperature pathways compared to a no-climate-change scenario.
  9: Economic damages
Highlights:
  1: Incremental improvements in reduction targets are insufficient to align collective
    ambition with the goals of the Paris Agreement; a transformational increase in
    2030 ambition is required to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and avoid
    the worst impacts of climate change.
  2: Near-term mitigation efforts are linked directly to climate impact projections
    up to 2100 and beyond.
  3: The study analyzes the impact of incremental improvements in Nationally Determined
    Contributions (NDCs) on global warming, comparing scenarios with different levels
    of ambition.
  4: "The paper illustrates the implications of different temperature trajectories\
    \ on long-term sea-level rise, extreme hot days, and economic damages. It uses\
    \ the current NDC pathway as a reference, comparing it to a gradual improvement\
    \ scenario (BE33) and a 1.5\xB0C scenario."
  5: "Differences in extreme temperature and economic damage outcomes are clearly\
    \ distinguishable between scenarios with no increase in ambition, a 33% increase\
    \ in ambition, and a 1.5\xB0C scenario."
  6: "Gradual improvements in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are insufficient\
    \ to achieve the 1.5\xB0C limit. More ambitious mitigation targets for big emitters\
    \ have the biggest effect on global mean temperature and related impacts."
  7: "Current NDC trajectories imply substantial additional impacts, and even a 33%\
    \ increase in ambition by big emitters only reduces about half the inferred impacts\
    \ compared to limiting warming to 1.5\u25E6C. Differences in median sea-level\
    \ rise between a 1.5\u25E6C and NDC scenario in 2100 amount to about 20cm. Extreme\
    \ heat impacts are doubled between 1.5\u25E6C and NDC pathways."
  8: "Illustrates the projected economic impacts of climate change by region and scenario,\
    \ with a general negative trend in GDP per capita by 2100. The impact appears\
    \ more severe under the NDC pathway compared to the 1.5\xB0C and BE33 pathways.\
    \ SIDS show particularly steep negative changes, especially by 2100 under the\
    \ NDC scenario."
  9: "The overall percentage reductions need to be translated back to each country's\
    \ specific NDC 'language'. A transformational increase in 2030 ambitions by countries\
    \ is needed to achieve the 1.5\u25E6C limit and to avoid the impacts of exceeding\
    \ this level of warming."
Methodology:
  1: "Assessments of different scenarios of NDC updating that fall short of achieving\
    \ the 1.5\u25E6C benchmark and projections of global mean temperature increase\
    \ by 2100 for different incremental NDC update scenarios."
  2: The analysis combines in-depth analysis of mitigation targets by big emitters
    to climate impact projections. It uses the Climate Action Tracker (CAT) methodology
    to estimate the collective result of current NDCs in global emissions. The CAT
    provides global mean temperature estimates of this pathway until the end of the
    century.
  3: GHG emission pathways are used to derive probabilistic projections for the global
    mean temperature (GMT) with the reduced complexity carbon cycle and climate model
    MAGICC6 (Meinshausen et al., 2011).
  4: "The analysis uses the MAGICC sea-level model for sea-level rise projections\
    \ from 1850 to 2300, emulating IPCC AR5 process-based model projections. Changes\
    \ in hot extremes (TXx) are based on a time-slicing approach using CMIP5 models,\
    \ selecting 21-year periods corresponding to specific global warming levels. Economic\
    \ damages are calculated based on the methodology by Burke et al. (2018), combining\
    \ historical GDP growth and temperature variability with projected future temperature\
    \ changes for mid-century (2046\u20132065) and end-of-century (2081\u20132100)."
  6: The analysis uses scenarios with different levels of emission reductions (5%,
    10%, 25%, and 33%) applied to either big emitters only or all countries. Global
    mean temperature projections are provided for the year 2100 relative to 1750,
    based on these emission scenarios.
  7: The analysis compares selected climate impacts under different scenarios of mitigation
    ambition. It projects median values and model ranges (66% and 95%) for sea-level
    rise. The results are applicable for understanding the potential benefits of increased
    mitigation ambition on the selected climate impacts.
  8: Climate model projections (GCMs) used to estimate economic damages under different
    temperature pathways; Cumulative distributions based on area-weighted aggregation
    of TXx change values projected at grid cells within a region; Boxplots show distribution
    of GDP changes.
  9: The study computes emission pathways and provides temperature and sea-level projections.
    It assumes that the contribution to the NDC enhancement will be equal for LULUCF
    and no-LULUCF sectors. The economic analysis uses code openly available on GitHub.
More Notes:
  2: The paper focuses on how incremental improvements to NDCs affect climate impacts.
  3: The study focuses on global emissions and temperature increases, without specifically
    addressing regional or U.S. impacts.
  4: "The Antarctic sea-level component in the MAGICC model does not reflect the proposed\
    \ process of marine ice cliff instability. The post-2100 model responses are more\
    \ stylized as radiative forcing levels are held constant at 2100 levels. Downscaling\
    \ factors are calculated for each model based on differences in annual mean temperature\
    \ between two 20-year periods (2046\u20132065 and 2081\u20132100) and a reference\
    \ period (1986\u20132005)."
  6: The scenarios are evaluated based on emission reductions relative to present-day
    NDC emission levels in 2030.
  7: The analysis focuses on the overall collective aggregate ambition increase needed
    in the short term rather than individual NDC updates.
  9: The study acknowledges the importance of considering fair share and equity in
    emissions reductions. The study emphasizes the need for all countries to contribute
    their fair share in their 2020 NDCs to meet the Paris Agreement's long-term temperature
    goal.
Quantitative material:
  1: "GDP reduction in tropical countries of around 60% compared to a no-climate-change\
    \ scenario under maintained current NDCs up to 2100 and beyond; median long-term\
    \ sea-level rise of close to 2m in 2300 under maintained current NDCs up to 2100\
    \ and beyond; an increase in aggregated NDC ambition of big emitters by 33% in\
    \ 2030 does not reduce presented climate impacts by more than about half compared\
    \ to limiting warming to 1.5\u25E6C."

  3: Incremental NDC improvement scenarios are created assuming 5%, 10%, 25% and 33%
    reduction in global GHG emission levels below the current NDC reference pathway
    by 2030.
  4: The paper presents land fraction distributions of changes in the intensity of
    the hottest day in a year (TXx). Economic damages are expressed in terms of gross
    domestic product (GDP) loss.
  5: "Under a 1.5\xB0C scenario, for 50% of the land area TXx would increase by at\
    \ least 1.1\xB0C compared to current conditions; For the BE33 scenario, half of\
    \ the land area would experience an increase in TXx of at least 1.8\xB0C; The\
    \ global median increase of TXx under the NDC scenario is projected to be 2.7\xB0\
    C above the 1986\u20132005 level; Estimated median reduction in GDP per capita\
    \ around 2050 for vulnerable regions ranges between 11% and 14% for the 1.5\xB0\
    C pathway, between 14% and 17% for the BE33 scenario, and between 17% and 20%\
    \ reduction for the baseline pathway of the current NDCs."
  6: "Projects a median global mean temperature increase for 2100 relative to 1750\
    \ under different emission reduction scenarios, ranging from 3.0\xB0C to 1.75\xB0\
    C depending on the level of emission reduction (0% to 33%) by big emitters or\
    \ all countries. Provides projected GHG emissions for 2030 in CO2 equivalent for\
    \ various scenarios."
