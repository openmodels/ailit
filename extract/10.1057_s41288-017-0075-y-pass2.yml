Drivers of Risk:
  1: Underinsurance of climate-related extreme events such as windstorm, flood, drought,
    and brushfire, which constitutes a significant portion of global property protection
    gap.
  2: Risk takers not fully insuring due to transaction costs, affordability issues
    particularly for lower-income households and SMEs, moral hazard, risk-adjusted
    premiums challenging low-income individuals in hazard-prone areas. Natural catastrophes
    (earthquakes, floods, and wind) are drivers of property damage losses.
  5: Extreme events (earthquake, windstorm, flood); Lack of insurance penetration;
    Cultural/religious acceptance of insurance; Historic under-representation of specific
    events (e.g., earthquakes) in loss data.
  6: Exposure to natural catastrophes; urbanization; mortgage penetration; access
    to the formal financial sector and domestic credit; savings as a substitute to
    insurance.
  8: Earthquakes, floods, and windstorms are the costliest perils, particularly in
    areas of high population and property value concentrations; the shift of exposures
    moving to emerging economies, which are less resilient in coping with the economic
    consequences of natural catastrophes.
  9: Natural catastrophes (earthquakes, wind, flood, drought, etc.), economic development,
    protection gap (difference between insured and total losses).
  10: Windstorm, earthquake, and flood.
  12: Insurance penetration increases with economic development but can lag due to
    factors like risk perception, buying behavior, and market inefficiencies, especially
    in middle-income countries.
  13: Consumption per capita and natural catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, and wind).
  15: Historical disaster losses and availability bias, financial market access, and
    the prevalence of foreign ownership affecting insurance penetration.
  16: Natural catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, wind), lack of insurance coverage,
    restrictive policy terms, undervaluation of insured assets.
  19: Natural catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, wind), underinsurance, and lack of
    Sharia-compliant insurance products in Muslim-majority countries are highlighted
    as drivers of risk.
  20: Natural disasters, extreme weather events, and climate change present a growing
    burden on government budgets.
  21: Economic development and the shift of growth to less-insured lower-income economies
    are drivers of increased weather-related economic and insured losses; Economic
    development drives insurance penetration; Rapid growth during the prior decade
    lags behind in protection compared to countries with slower paced growth; Financial
    sector development, access to the formal financial sector (specifically mortgage
    penetration), openness to foreign competition and low market concentration drive
    property insurance penetration.
  22: Natural catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, wind), inadequate insurance coverage.
  24: Natural catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, wind) are identified as drivers of
    risk, impacting property damage and leading to insured and uninsured losses.
  26: Natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, floods, and wind, as represented by
    expected economic losses and historical economic damages in different GDP periods.

Highlights:
  1: The paper identifies a large protection gap in climate-related risks, estimating
    more than USD 2.9 trillion in uninsured losses globally and proposes measures
    to reduce underinsurance.
  2: Property insurance penetration is influenced by economic factors such as consumption
    per capita. A significant portion of natural catastrophe losses are uninsured,
    particularly in emerging economies.
  5: The protection gap can be narrowed by reducing expected economic losses E(L j,c)
    or increasing expected insured losses E(I j,c). Significant portion of potential
    customers in emerging economies have never had formal insurance before.
  6: Economic development (specifically consumption per capita) is positively correlated
    to insurance demand. High exposure to natural catastrophes increases perception
    of risk and demand for property insurance, but this effect may be outweighed by
    income constraints in low-income economies.
  8: There is a substantial natural catastrophe protection gap worldwide. Uninsured
    losses are growing in relation to GDP, particularly in emerging economies.
  9: Uninsured losses from natural catastrophes are growing faster than GDP, especially
    in emerging economies. Economic development contributes significantly to the growth
    of uninsured losses. The growth of exposure to losses outpaces GDP growth.
  10: The US, Japan, and China have the largest absolute uninsured losses from natural
    catastrophes. Smaller economies like Taiwan, Turkey, Chile, Philippines, Hong
    Kong, and Mexico are particularly vulnerable when losses are measured as a percentage
    of GDP. Uninsured emerging economies have fluctuating uninsured losses that peaked
    in the early 2000's, while uninsured advanced economies have seen relatively stable
    losses over time.
  12: Middle-income economies are most underinsured in relation to GDP, indicating
    potential macroeconomic vulnerabilities due to substantial uninsured property
    risk.
  13: Empirical evidence suggests the logistic model fits high-income countries better
    than low-income countries. A linear or double-log model may be more appropriate
    for modelling drivers of insurance.
  15: Mortgage penetration significantly increases insurance penetration, while mobile
    phone access has a negative correlation due to multiple SIM card usage.
  16: Underinsurance is a significant problem in emerging markets, with a large portion
    of risk uninsured;  Uninsured losses are a significant percentage of GDP, particularly
    in emerging economies.
  19: Mandatory insurance schemes can form the widest possible risk community and
    eliminate adverse selection, leading to more affordable premiums through cross-subsidization.
    Underinsurance is a significant problem, especially in emerging markets.
  20: Governments can reduce fiscal vulnerability to disasters by transferring contingent
    costs of natural catastrophe damage off government balance-sheets and into the
    capital markets.
  21: Underinsurance of property risks is a global challenge, driven by economic development
    and the shift of growth to less-insured lower-income economies; Weather-related
    uninsured losses are growing faster than GDP; Closing the insurance gap requires
    measures by insurers and governments.
  22: The USA has the highest total losses from natural catastrophes. Uninsured losses
    are significant, particularly in emerging economies. There is a potential 'underinsurance'
    gap based on a best-practice benchmark for insurance penetration vs consumption.
  24: 'The graphs and citations suggest that: 1) The USA experiences the highest total
    losses from natural catastrophes, with significant uninsured earthquake and flood
    losses. 2) Underinsurance is observed in property insurance markets as compared
    to best-practice benchmarks in markets with similar consumption.'
  26: Charts reveal insights into insurance penetration related to GDP per capita
    and uninsured losses over time, highlighting underinsurance in various economies.
  27: USA, Japan, and China have the highest total losses from natural catastrophes;
    Uninsured emerging economies show the most fluctuation in weather-related uninsured
    losses as a percentage of GDP; There is an underinsurance gap between current
    insurance penetration and best-practice benchmarks.
  28: The USA, Japan, and China are identified as countries with the highest total
    expected annual property damage losses from natural catastrophes. The analysis
    suggests underinsurance is a significant issue in many countries, as indicated
    by data points falling below the 'best-practice benchmark' in the scatter plots.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis uses a framework to define the protection gap in historical and
    expected terms through modeling uninsured expected losses using geophysical vulnerability
    maps, economic exposure data, and insurance market information; it assesses expected
    insurance penetration for 53 countries over a 15-year period.
  2: Panel data analysis of 53 countries over 15 years to identify drivers of property
    insurance penetration. Multi-variate panel specifications are used to test the
    significance of economic, socio-demographic, legal-political, financial, and insurance
    market structural variables. Geo-physical scenario models quantify the expected
    protection gap.
  5: The protection gap is calculated by summing the difference between economic losses
    and insured losses across different types of extreme events, countries, and years.
    A static model is used, calculating expected losses and insured values for the
    year 2015. Expected economic loss is based on historical data (1980-2015) and
    underlying risk distributions.
  6: Modeling the estimated gap between expected losses E(L j,c) and industry data
    on E(I j,c). Empirical test of significant determinants of E( Ip,c), where p encompasses
    property lines. Uses property penetration as a proxy for changes in take-up rates
    over time.
  8: Analysis is based on historical data of natural catastrophe losses from Swiss
    Re's sigma data and global cat loss database.

    penetration; Cross-section data analysis; Comparison of emerging and mature economies.
    Applies to the period 1990-2016.
  10: Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate expected losses for 30 countries,
    using global hazard maps for windstorm, earthquake, and flood, with probability
    distributions at the sub-national level, a vulnerability module, data on the value
    of insured objects, and information about insurance market conditions.
  12: An insurance penetration model uses logistic regression to estimate a 'best-practice
    benchmark' for property risk insurance penetration based on economic development
    levels, using a sample of 45 countries.
  13: The study uses a logistic model to analyze property insurance penetration and
    consumption per capita, and the relationship between income and insurance is analyzed
    with linear and double-log models. Robustness checks are performed using a double-log
    model.
  15: Analysis performed using panel data models and correlation analysis, focusing
    on factors influencing insurance penetration across different countries.
  16: Presents a taxonomy of underinsurance and proposes measures to narrow the protection
    gap. Uses statistical data to illustrate relationships between consumption, insurance
    penetration, and uninsured losses.
  21: Analyzed economic, financial, geographic, and social variables to identify significant
    determinants of property insurance penetration.
  24: The methodology used to generate the bar chart and the scatter plots is not
    explicitly described but the graphs present empirical relationships. Time periods
    are mentioned for losses (1990-2015).
  26: No explicit methodology is described; the text primarily presents graph analyses
    and descriptive statistics.
  27: Panel models used to analyze drivers of insurance penetration; Benchmarking
    to identify underinsurance based on consumption per capita; Analysis of catastrophe
    scenarios to determine protection gaps; Time series analysis of uninsured losses
    as % of GDP
  28: The analysis uses log-linear and logistic models to estimate GDP losses due
    to climate change, comparing modeled values to benchmark values to calculate a
    'gap to benchmark'. A scenario-based approach is also used to assess the 'modeled
    protection gap' related to property insurance penetration. The timeframe or scope
    of the analysis is not explicitly stated, but losses are presented as annual figures.
More Notes:
  1: The paper utilizes a unique dataset of property insurance premiums for 53 countries,
    allowing for analysis of insurance penetration related to consumption and geographical
    risk exposure.
  2: The paper aims to identify and quantify the protection gap in property insurance
    related to climate-related extreme events using cross-country panel analysis.
    The analysis includes exploring the drivers of property insurance penetration
    and proposing measures to close the protection gap.
  5: The model is static and does not address the impact of long-term climate change
    scenarios, economic development, or changes in insurance penetration.
  6: Property policy is a necessary pre-requisite to coverage for natural catastrophe
    damages in many markets.
  9: The paper emphasizes the role of economic development and shifting patterns of
    growth to less insured high-growth economies in explaining the increase in uninsured
    catastrophe losses. There is an analysis of a 'protection gap' - where emerging
    economies have larger gaps.
  10: The study estimates the 'protection gap,' which is the difference between expected
    economic loss and insured loss.
  13: The symmetrical design of a logistic function implies that low-income countries
    are as slow in advancing from low penetration as high income countries are decelerating
    when reaching maturity.
  15: The paper indicates Internet access has a weakly positive correlation with insurance
    penetration, and discusses inconclusive results for variables like property rights
    and corruption.
  16: The page focuses on property insurance related to natural catastrophes. It categorizes
    different types of underinsurance and suggests potential entry points for promoting
    insurance uptake, such as agriculture, motor, or health insurance.  The scatter
    plots and line graph indicate relationships between economic development, insurance
    penetration, and uninsured losses. The bar chart provides a visual comparison

    mitigating the economic impact of natural disasters. The data spans from 1990
    to around 2015, and the working paper from Aseervatham, Born and Richter suggests
    the importance of considering behavioural factors when assessing risk reactions.
    This page suggests macroeconomic risk management strategies are not optimized
    in general.
  24: The references suggest a focus on insurance markets, risk management, and the
    economic consequences of natural disasters, with a particular emphasis on factors
    influencing insurance demand and the role of public-private partnerships in mitigating
