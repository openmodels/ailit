Drivers of Risk:
  5: "Strong El Ni\xF1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events (El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1\
    a shocks), climate hazards, weather shocks associated with strong ENSO events,\
    \ economic development, prudential regulation, the specific characteristics of\
    \ banks and their counterparties."
Highlights:
  5: "Strong El Ni\xF1o shocks are associated with lower banking stability, increased\
    \ sovereign spreads, and increased credit and liquidity risks. Strong La Ni\xF1\
    a shocks are associated with higher sovereign spreads in the medium term, and\
    \ can have benefits for banks, with no significant impact on banking stability,\
    \ but higher banks\u2019 performances and lower credit risk. Climate risks can\
    \ lead to a vicious cycle where banking instability prompts tighter credit constraints,\
    \ leading to underinvestment in climate adaptation and mitigation."
Methodology:
  5: 'Paper 1: Uses strong ENSO events as a natural experiment for climate shocks.  Paper
    2: Uses Local Projections to assess the dynamic response of sovereign spreads
    to ENSO events.  Paper 3: Review of empirical literature, aligned with financial
    accelerator theory.'
More Notes:
  5: "The findings are specific to Latin American countries and the impact of strong\
    \ ENSO events.  The papers suggest potential asymmetries in the effects of El\
    \ Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a shocks. Banks with a larger size, a higher capital ratio,\
    \ and less market-oriented activities are more resilient to adverse climate shocks\
    \ resulting from ENSO events."

Outcome(s) of Interest:

    \ liquidity risks, economic activity, access to credit markets, underinvestment\
    \ in climate adaptation and mitigation projects."
Quantitative material:
  5: 'Paper 1: Uses panel data of 1208 banks from 16 Latin American countries over
    2005-2019. Paper 2: Uses monthly panel data from 2007-2019 for seven Latin American
    countries.'
