Drivers of Risk:
  2: Sea level changes driven by ice volume changes, CO2 concentrations, and tectonic
    processes impact coastal living space, food resources, and economy.
  3: Changes in ocean temperature, land ice volume, and the volumes of ocean basins
    are noted as drivers impacting sea level variations.
  4: No relevant information
  5: "Sea level variations on the order of 15\xB110 m occurred as significant ice\
    \ sheets grew and decayed."
  6: Fluctuations in atmospheric CO2 levels, orbital cycles (precession, tilt, eccentricity),
    volcanic activity (Columbia River basalts)
  7: None described in the context of this page.
  8: Anthropogenic warming, ocean warming, melting of ice sheets and mountain glaciers.
Evaluation overview:
  2: The paper provides an overview of sea level changes as indicators of Earth's
    climate states and notes their impact on society, particularly along coastlines.
  3: No relevant overview of a specific climate outcome like mortality or productivity
    loss is provided.
  4: No relevant information
  5: No relevant information
  6: No relevant information
  7: None provided on the provided page; the focus is on historical and future sea
    level changes.
  8: Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) rise.
Highlights:
  2: GMSL changes indicate historical climate states, and under ongoing global warming,
    ancient analogs suggest a long-term rise of ~10 m under moderate emissions scenarios.
  3: Current anthropogenic CO2 trends could lead to significant increases in atmospheric
    CO2, impacting sea levels; Ice volume changes dominantly influence historical
    sea level changes.
  4: Convergence of independent methods allows identification of GMSL changes and
    inferences about their mechanisms.
  5: "Small (15\u201325 m sea level equivalent or 25%\u201340% of modern volume),\
    \ ephemeral ice sheets existed during the Late Cretaceous to Eocene in the interior\
    \ of Antarctica. Marine-terminating glaciers existed at the Sabrina Coast, adjacent\
    \ to the Aurora Basin, Antarctica, by the Early to Middle Eocene. Significant\
    \ ice sheets can exist in regions of high Antarctic topography even while subtropical\
    \ conditions persist along the coast."
  6: "Dynamic growth and collapse of moderately large ice sheets (0%\u201375% of modern\
    \ EAIS) during the Middle to Late Eocene, controlled by the 1,200 kyr tilt cycle.\
    \ Development of a continental-scale EAIS in the Early Oligocene associated with\
    \ million-year sea level falls of 40\u201360 m. The Pliocene recorded the last\
    \ major warm period (4.5\u20133 Ma) when global mean surface temperatures were\
    \ 2\xB0\u20133\xB0C warmer than 1850 CE, CO2 was similar to 2020, and sea levels\
    \ stood ~22\xB110 m above present."
  7: No specific outcomes highlighted on this page.
  8: The modern period of GMSL rise began in the late nineteenth century, and the
    rate of rise over the twentieth century was the fastest in at least 3,000 years.
    GMSL acceleration is occurring. Even with emissions reductions, substantial sea
    level rise is inevitable. Under higher emissions scenarios, twenty-first century
    GMSL rise greater than 2 m cannot be excluded.
Methodology:
  2: The results reflect studies of ancient sea levels, combined with modern imaging,
    data, and modeling techniques.
  3: Sea level change is measured using tide gauges and satellite data; ancient sea
    level reconstructions use proxies and radiometric data.
  4: Uses sea level curves, drilling data, sequence stratigraphy, and backstripping
    for estimating historical sea level changes and their mechanisms.
  5: "Sea level estimates were derived using benthic (Cibicidoides) foraminiferal\
    \ \u03B418Obenthic splice and \u03B418Oseawater using temperatures from Mg/Ca\
    \ records. Smoothing was performed by interpolating to 20 kyr intervals and using\
    \ a 49-point Gaussian convolution filter, removing periods shorter than 490 kyr.\
    \ Backstripping (progressive accounting for the effects of compaction, loading,\
    \ and thermal subsidence) was used for onshore New Jersey estimates."
  6: "Uses \u03B418O-Mg/Ca-based estimates to show sea level changes over geological\
    \ time scales, analysis of sediment tracer data."

    projections for sea level changes.

    using satellite data. Discussion of process modeling and ancient sea level analogs
    for long-term projections.
More Notes:
  2: The paper provides context for the use of sea level as a climate indicator and
    mentions regional effects on sea level such as land motion and thermal subsidence.
  3: Discussion of climate states (Hothouse, Icehouse, Greenhouse) and their historical
    context is provided.
  4: No relevant information
  5: "The sea level record older than 48 million years is dashed because of uncertainties\
    \ in the Mg/Ca record. New Jersey estimates for the Early to Middle Eocene were\
    \ shifted by \u201350 m to compensate for long-term (2\u201310 million years)\
    \ effects that are likely due to changes in mantle dynamic topography."
