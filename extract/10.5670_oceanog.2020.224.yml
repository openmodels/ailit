Drivers of Risk:
  7: "The drivers of risk are related to past climate change (Late Pleistocene, Early/Middle/Late\
    \ Holocene), current climate change (Anthropocene), and future climate change\
    \ scenarios (2\xB0C and 5\xB0C warming scenarios)."
Highlights:
  7: Sea level rise projections extend to 2200, with potential for over 0.7m of sea
    level rise by 2100 and a rise rate of ~12.5 mm/yr in 2100 based on a quadratic
    regression model.
Methodology:
  7: The analysis utilizes coral data, glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models,
    statistical analyses of satellite and tide gauge records, and process-model projections
    to estimate and project sea level rise.
More Notes:
  7: The paper uses past sea level changes to help inform future model-based projections,
    and shows a high level of uncertainty in these projections (indicated by shading).
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  7: This page focuses on sea level rise as a key outcome, but does not directly address
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
Quantitative material:
  7: The graphs provide quantitative information on sea level rise over time, measured
    in meters (m) relative to a baseline. Specific data points and projections are
    included, showing sea level at various years.
