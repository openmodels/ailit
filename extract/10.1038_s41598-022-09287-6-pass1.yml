Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increase in the number of major tropical cyclone landfalls.
  3: Landfall intensity (LI) and Landfall Maximum Intensity (LMI) of tropical cyclones
    (TCs) are the primary risk drivers examined. The paper explores the relationship
    between global annual mean LMI and LI.
  4: Changes in the number of tropical cyclones making landfall as major storms (intensity
    at landfall).
Highlights:
  1: The annual global number of tropical cyclone landfalls with major intensity has
    nearly doubled from 1982 to 2020.
  3: The paper finds a significant increase in global landfalls based on Poisson regression,
    and that the increase in LMI has increased the number of landfalls as major TCs,
    while their mean intensity at landfall has not changed. It also notes a weak relationship
    between global annual mean LMI and LI of landfalling storms.
  4: "Significant global changes in the number of tropical cyclones making landfall\
    \ as major storms for the period 1982\u20132020 are observed, which poses a direct\
    \ socio-economic threat."
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of global tropical cyclone landfall changes, focusing on major landfall
    count and intensity change of major TCs from 1982 to 2020, with additional analysis
    for the period 1970-2020. Statistical significance is assessed using Poisson and
    linear regressions.
  3: The study employs Poisson regression to analyze landfall counts and assess the
    statistical significance of trends. It also uses Lanczos filtering to examine
    decadal correlations. Epochal analysis (2001-2020 minus 1982-2000) is used to
    compare changes in LI and LMI. Synthetic TC tracks downscaled from global climate
    analyses are mentioned as a potential future analysis tool.
  4: "Analysis of best-track data (LMI \u2265 33 m s\u207B\xB9) from the International\
    \ Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) v04r00."
More Notes:
  1: "The study emphasizes the importance of major tropical cyclones at landfall (LI\
    \ \u2265 50 m s\u22121) because they account for most of the TC-related damage."
  3: The analysis suggests that the increase in landfall counts is not sensitive to
    the period examined or how landfall is defined, but notes that a lack of significant
    trends by basin may be due to large inter-basin variability. The paper also discusses
    the decoupling of LI and LMI, where TC LI has a much larger variation compared
    to that of TC LMI.
  4: The study focuses on the intensity at landfall, differentiating it from previous
    analyses that considered lifetime maximum intensity over oceans (LMI).
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Socio-economic impact from tropical cyclones.
  3: The paper focuses on changes in tropical cyclone (TC) landfall frequency and
    intensity, which could have downstream macroeconomic and fiscal implications,
    though these are not explicitly modeled.
  4: Major tropical cyclone landfalls are a direct socio-economic threat due to the
    large majority of tropical-cyclone-related damage being caused by them.
Quantitative material:
  1: "The number of annual global tropical cyclone (TC) landfalls with major landfall\
    \ intensity (LI \u2265 50 m s\u22121) has nearly doubled from 1982 to 2020. The\
    \ lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) of global major landfalling TCs has been increasing\
    \ by 0.8 m s\u22121 per decade (p < 0.05). Global number of landfalls with a doubling\
    \ time of 46 years (p < 0.05), increasing from about four to seven annually over\
    \ the last 40 years. There is also an increase in the global number of TCs (Fig.\
    \ 1b), showing a consistent and significant doubling time of 47 years (p < 0.05).\
    \ Linear trend analysis shows a significant increase in the annual number of landfalls\
    \ (+0.8 count per decade, p < 0.05) and TCs (+1.6 count per decade, p<0.05)."
  3: "The paper finds a doubling time of 48 years (p = 0.02) for 1970\u20132010 and\
    \ 70 years (p = 0.03) for 1970\u20132017 for global landfalls using Poisson regression."
  4: "Significant global changes in the number of tropical cyclones making landfall\
    \ as major storms for the period 1982\u20132020 are observed."
