Drivers of Risk:
  1: Observed increase in air temperature in major Polish cities.
Highlights:
  1: "Mean daily temperature in all major Polish cities is exhibiting a statistically\
    \ significant increasing trend, up to 0.52 \xB0C/decade. Increasing air temperature\
    \ reduces heating demand but increases cooling needs. The climate warming affects\
    \ operation conditions, energy source, driving force, capacity and efficiency\
    \ of renewable energy sources. Changes were stronger on the demand side than on\
    \ the supply side."
Methodology:
  1: "Statistical analysis of historical mean daily temperature observed in 19 major\
    \ Polish cities over the 1968\u20132018 period; qualitative analysis of potential\
    \ impact on the operation of selected renewable energy sources; review of the\
    \ relation between air temperature and observed electrical load."
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the impact of temperature changes on the renewable energy
    sector and electricity demand, rather than direct macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: "Mean daily temperature in all major Polish cities exhibiting a statistically\
    \ significant increasing trend, up to 0.52 \xB0C/decade (over 1968-2018 period)."
