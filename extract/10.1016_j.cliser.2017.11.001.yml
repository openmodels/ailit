Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate shocks, drought, floods, inter-annual climate variability, increase in
    frequency and intensity of extreme weather phenomena, including rainstorms and
    drought.
Highlights:
  2: The paper assesses the drivers of investment in climate services within Uruguay
    by using semi-structured interviews to identify factors contributing to the decision
    to invest in a national-level climate service for the agricultural sector.
Methodology:
  2: Semi-structured interviews were used to identify several factors that contributed
    to the decision to invest in and develop a national-level climate service for
    the agricultural sector in Uruguay.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: "Economic losses associated with the 2008\u20132009 drought neared $1 billion\
    \ USD. The 2015\u20132016 El Ni\xF1o event also contributed to the worst \uFB02\
    oods experienced in Uruguay in more than 50 years, with more than 12,000 people\
    \ made temporarily homeless and economic losses in a range of productive sectors."
Quantitative material:
  2: "Economic losses from 2008-2009 drought neared $1 billion USD. 2015-2016 floods\
    \ made more than 12,000 people temporarily homeless. Agriculture contributes roughly\
    \ 6% to its GDP, but accounts for 13% of the workforce and more than 70% of exports.\
    \ The total contribution of Uruguay\u2019s agricultural sector reaches nearly\
    \ 25% of GDP."
