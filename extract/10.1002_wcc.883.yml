Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate-related changes, increasing global warming, sea level rise.
  7: Reduced availability of water resources and flood risks driven by factors like
    riverine, pluvial, and coastal flooding.
  8: Heat extremes (KR1)

Highlights:
  2: Adaptation pathways can diverge as global warming increases, leading to radically
    different futures. Adaptation measures for different risks interact, resulting
    in trade-offs. Supporting conditions such as legitimacy, buy-in, collaboration,
    and effective governance are needed for successful implementation of adaptation.
  7: Adaptation options include supply-side solutions like reservoirs and desalination;
    demand-side options like water pricing and land management for water scarcity,
    and structural defenses and flood accommodations for flood risks.
  8: Current adaptation is focused mainly on 'low hanging fruit,' existing options,
    and near-term risks, resulting in inertia and societies being ill-prepared for
    unexperienced heat extremes. Adaptation options like air conditioning can reinforce
    existing inequalities and lock in societies.

Methodology:
  2: Illustrative pathways built on quantitative and qualitative assessment of adaptation
    effectiveness; examination of adaptation pathways developed for the Europe Chapter
    of the IPCC AR6.
  8: A dynamic adaptation approach combining existing measures to reduce risks quickly,
    allowing time for more resource-demanding, transformative adaptation with longer
    lead times. Warming-sensitive adaptation pathways are designed based on author
    consensus, collated adaptation options, and risk characterization from literature
    and databases.

More Notes:
  8: The study emphasizes the need for transformative adaptation measures beyond current
    practices and the importance of dynamic adaptation planning embedded in specific
    contexts.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Adaptation pathways and their effectiveness; trade-offs between adaptation measures
    for different risks (e.g., increasing water scarcity).
  7: Potential maladaptation leading to adverse impacts on ecosystems and cascading
    impacts beyond the water sector.
