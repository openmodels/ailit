Drivers of Risk:
  2: "Global mean temperatures > 2\xB0C above pre-industrial levels (high-end climate\
    \ change scenarios); greenhouse gas emissions trends pointing to possible increases\
    \ of 4\xB0C or more in the long-term."
  11: Climate change impact and adaptation modelling
Highlights:
  2: Benefits in some regions and sectors, such as increasing forest productivity
    in northern Europe, are offset by detrimental effects in others. Shifting to sustainable
    lifestyles, good governance for sustainability and climate resilience, and new
    forms of integrated and sustainable resource management are important.
  4: The IMPRESSIONS project uses a stakeholder-driven approach to develop and evaluate
    adaptation, mitigation, and transformation pathways under different climate change
    scenarios.
  11: The IMPRESSIONS project explores climate change impacts and adaptation using
    a multi-faceted approach.
Methodology:
  2: 'The IMPRESSIONS project developed integrated climate and socio-economic scenarios
    and applied these to multi-sectoral impact models in five case studies: Hungary,
    Scotland, Iberia, Europe as a whole, and Central Asia. Adaptation and mitigation
    pathways were generated with stakeholders.'
  3: The IMPRESSIONS project developed a stakeholder-driven methodology to create
    integrated high-end climate and socio-economic scenarios and applied them to models
    of impacts and adaptation to analyze multi-scale and cross-sectoral synergies
    and trade-offs. It involved participatory workshops and online engagement with
    stakeholders.
  4: The study uses the IPCC scenario framework of Shared Socio-economic Pathways
    (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to create integrated scenarios
    of potential futures under high-end climate change. These scenarios drive models
    that project future changes in impacts for different sectors. Stakeholder engagement
    is used to co-create visions of sustainable futures and adaptation, mitigation,
    and transformation pathways. The effectiveness of pathways is evaluated using
    models and qualitative analyses, with results fed back into stakeholder engagement.
  11: The IMPRESSIONS project uses decision-maker needs assessments, high-end climate
    and socio-economic scenarios, climate change impact and adaptation modelling,
    stakeholder engagement processes, adaptation and mitigation pathways, and integrated
    and transformative solutions.
More Notes:
  2: The stakeholder-led approach ensured the research was driven by the priorities
    of decision-makers. The project aimed to identify robust, innovative, and effective
    solutions for addressing high-end climate change.
  3: The IMPRESSIONS project involved five case studies, one of which was at the national
    scale in Scotland.
  4: The page describes the IMPRESSIONS project's methodology, which emphasizes stakeholder
    involvement and the creation of integrated scenarios. It doesn't provide specific
    quantitative results or detail macroeconomic/fiscal outcomes but focuses on the
    process of developing and evaluating pathways to a sustainable future.
  11: The figure presents methodological components and references publications within
    the IMPRESSIONS project, suggesting a comprehensive approach to climate change
    impact and adaptation research across various European regions and Central Asia.
    The page itself does not contain the specific results of that research.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Severe water scarcity, heat stress, and loss of productivity are detrimental
    effects in southern Europe and parts of central and eastern Europe; widespread
    flood damage.
