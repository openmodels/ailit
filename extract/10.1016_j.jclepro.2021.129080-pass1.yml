Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, specifically rising temperatures, increasing peak electricity
    load.
  3: Temperature changes impacting electricity peak loads.
  4: The increase of regional economic growth, urbanization rate, and expansion of
    population will push up regional power load.
  5: Temperature changes (specifically, rises in maximum temperature).
  6: Annual maximum temperature increases and socioeconomic development are major
    drivers impacting national peak load and infrastructure investment needs.
  7: Climate change impacts on peak load demand, socioeconomic factors
  8: Different climate change scenarios (SSP1-RCP2.6, SSP2-RCP4.5, SSP4-RCP6.0, SSP5-RCP8.5);
    inclusion or exclusion of socioeconomic variables in modeling.
Highlights:
  1: There is a significantly positive correlation between the provincial highest
    temperatures and peak loads in China. The impacts of maximum temperature on the
    peak load vary substantially among different regions, and the impacts are the
    most significant in the Eastern China region. The adoption and penetration of
    air conditioners is an important channel to materialize the impacts from temperature
    change to peak load.
  3: The study finds a consistent relationship between maximum temperatures and peak
    load, indicating climate change impacts on electricity demand.
  4: The study finds that temperature rise has a significant impact on peak load,
    greater than its impact on total electricity consumption. The estimation results
    are robust and comparable to studies conducted in other regions.
  5: Climate change impacts on peak load are significantly different across regions
    in China, with the economically developed Eastern region being the most sensitive
    to temperature increases due to higher air conditioning ownership and usage.
  6: China's national peak load is projected to increase significantly by the end
    of the century, necessitating substantial investment in power infrastructure.
  7: Peak load demand in China is projected to increase significantly by 2100, with
    the majority of the increase driven by socioeconomic factors rather than temperature
    increases alone; spatial distributions of the load will remain the same with the
    current status, and the Eastern China Region will still have the highest peak
    load.
  8: Inclusion of socioeconomic variables significantly increases the projected peak
    load growth rate in China under all SSP-RCP scenarios.
Methodology:
  1: Estimates the response functions of annual peak loads to maximum temperatures
    in China and then predicts the future peak loads under different scenarios.
  3: A two-way fixed effect panel data model is used to estimate peak load response
    to temperature using linear regression.
  4: Robustness tests using instrumental variables and Two-Stage Least Squares estimation
    show no endogenous effect in the estimation of GDP on peak load.
  5: Regression analysis of panel data across regions in China, analyzing the mediating
    effects of air conditioner ownership on the temperature-load relationship (equations
    2-4).
  6: Analysis is performed using a fixed-effects panel data model to estimate peak
    load response to temperature from 1998 to 2018 and includes regional income level
    comparisons.
  7: Estimated load-temperature response functions are used to project national peak
    load under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration
    Pathways (RCPs) scenarios.
  8: Peak load forecasting for the period 2018-2100 using different SSP-RCP scenarios,
    with and without the inclusion of socioeconomic variables. Results presented as
    peak load growth rate.
More Notes:
  1: This study focuses on peak electricity load and associated infrastructure investment
    costs, not broader macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes.
  5: The study uses the number of air conditioners as a mediating variable in load-temperature
    responses. The study also controls for Province and Year fixed effects in the
    regressions.
  7: Policy implications include integrating climate change into power system planning,
    promoting energy-efficient air conditioners and demand response programs, and
    utilizing electricity markets for optimal investment.
  8: The study uses maps with bar graphs to illustrate the forecast of provincial
    peak loads in 2030, 2050, and 2100 under different climate scenarios.

  1: No relevant information

  7: No relevant information
  8: Peak load growth rate; implied economic costs associated with increased energy
    demand due to climate change.
Quantitative material:
  1: "An increase of highest temperature by 1 \u25E6C will, on average, rise the peak\
    \ load by 0.385 GW in China. The national peak load is forecasted to reach between\
    \ 3807 GW and 6815 GW by the end of this century, requiring an additional infrastructure\
    \ investment of 275\u2013617 billion yuan per year."
  4: "A 1\xB0C increase in maximum temperature will increase peak load by an average\
    \ of 0.385 GW, representing a 2.33% increase compared to the historical average\
    \ level."
  5: "A 1\xB0C rise in maximum temperature in Eastern China results in a 0.708 GW\
    \ increase in peak load. This impact is reduced to 0.116 GW in Central China and\
    \ is insignificant in Western China."
  6: Forecasted investment requirements for infrastructure range from 275 to 617 billion
    yuan annually for wind and solar generators.
  7: National peak load is expected to reach between 3807 GW and 6815 GW in 2100 under
    different climate and socio-economic scenarios; temperature rise can contribute
    to 20% of the peak load increase.
  8: 'Peak load growth rate forecasts for China under different SSP-RCP scenarios:
    37% (SSP1-RCP2.6), 40% (SSP2-RCP4.5), 41% (SSP4-RCP6.0), 41% (SSP5-RCP8.5) when
    only climate variables are included; 365% (SSP1-RCP2.6), 445% (SSP2-RCP4.5), 280%
    (SSP4-RCP6.0), 580% (SSP5-RCP8.5) when climate and socioeconomic variables are
    included.'
