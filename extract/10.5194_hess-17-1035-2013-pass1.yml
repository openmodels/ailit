Drivers of Risk:
  11: Changes in glacier melt contribution due to temperature changes and precipitation
    patterns.
  14: Long-term decreases in glacier melt volumes due to global warming.
Highlights:
  11: The study estimates glacier melt contribution to streamflow during a specific
    period using isotope data and mass balance equations. The contribution varies
    depending on the altitude of snow and other environmental variables.
Methodology:
  11: "Mass balance equations using stable water isotope data (\u03B4 2H) in streamflow\
    \ and its sources (glacier melt, snowmelt) are used to estimate the contribution\
    \ of these sources to streamflow on specific dates (15 October and 15 December\
    \ 2011). Scenarios are considered based on different assumptions about the altitude\
    \ origin of snow."
More Notes:
  11: The analysis focuses on hydrological processes and source water contributions,
    not direct macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes. However, changes in streamflow
    could have implications for water resources and sectors dependent on them, which
    could indirectly affect the economy.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  11: No relevant information
  14: Dramatic decline in water availability for central Chile, especially in years
    with low precipitation.
Quantitative material:
  11: Equations (1) and (2) provide a framework for calculating the glacier melt contribution
    to streamflow based on isotope data. Table 3 shows resulting glacier melt contributions
    under various scenarios of snow altitude.
