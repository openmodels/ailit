Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increases in the number of wet days and extreme daily rainfall are identified
    as drivers reducing economic growth rates.
  3: Annual total rainfall, Monthly rainfall deviations (negative shock), Number of
    wet days, Extreme daily rainfall
  4: Extreme daily rainfall, Number of wet days, Monthly positive rainfall deviations,
    Monthly negative rainfall deviations, Annual total rainfall
  5: Annual total rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days, and extreme
    daily rainfall.
  6: Annual total rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, the number of wet days, and
    extreme daily rainfall are impacting the outcomes.
  7: The drivers of risk are rainfall measures including total rainfall (RA), number
    of wet days (RD(1mm)), and extreme rainfall days (RD^(99.9%)).
  8: Annual total rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days, extreme
    daily rainfall
  9: Rainfall variability, including annual total rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations,
    number of wet days, and extreme daily rainfall.
  10: Total annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days, and
    extreme daily rainfall, as well as annual mean temperature, are the drivers impacting
    economic growth.
  11: "Total annual rainfall (mm), monthly rainfall deviations (standard deviations),\
    \ number of wet days per year, and annual mean temperature (\xB0C)."
  12: Daily temperature variability (T_var), annual mean temperature (T_mean), annual
    rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, and number of wet days. The analysis considers
    both the first difference (D) and one-year lag (L) of some variables.

    specifically how increases in the number of wet days and extreme daily rainfall
    reduce economic growth rates.

    of the logarithm of gross regional product per capita.

  8: No relevant information
  9: No relevant information
  10: Economic growth rate is the outcome being evaluated.
  11: Economic growth rates in agricultural ('ag'), manufacturing ('man'), and service
    ('serv') sectors.
  12: Economic growth rates
Highlights:
  1: High-income nations and the services and manufacturing sectors are most affected
    by daily rainfall patterns, suggesting significant global economic consequences
    from anthropogenic intensification of rainfall extremes.
  3: The effects of the daily measures are decreased by the exclusion of the annual
    and monthly measures, and vice versa, suggesting that they are complementary measures.
    Greater rainfall may be beneficial if it does not cause increases in the number
    of wet days or in the extent of extreme daily rainfall.
  4: The effects of both number of wet days and extreme daily rainfall are strongest
    in winter and autumn, showing little response in summer and spring. The impact
    of extreme rainfall is modulated by annual mean temperature. No evidence for rebound
    effects in the short term is found, but some persistence is identified in the
    effect of the annual total and number of wet days. Economic impacts in the historical
    period have been largest from the number of wet days and negative monthly rainfall
    deviations.
  5: Effects from aspects of rainfall distribution (annual total, monthly deviations,
    wet days) have been larger than those of extreme daily rainfall in the historical
    period.
  6: "Identifies statistically significant effects from the number of wet days RD(1\
    \ mm)x,y and the measure of extreme daily rainfall RD\u02C6(99.9%)x,y. Notes a\
    \ quadratic effect of the number of wet days."
  7: The paper finds that considering a nonlinear effect of the number of wet days
    with income level considerably increases the statistical power of the model. It
    also assesses the magnitude of historical effect sizes for rainfall measures by
    multiplying marginal effects by the within-region standard deviation.
  8: 'The study maps the historical means of four principal rainfall measures: annual
    total rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days, and extreme daily
    rainfall.'
  9: The maps show spatial distributions of historical rainfall variability across
    the globe for four different rainfall measures, highlighting regions with greater
    or lesser variability in each category. Southeast Asia and parts of South America
    show high variability across multiple rainfall measures.
  10: Rich and poor countries have different economic growth responses to changes
    in rainfall and other climate variables. The effects of various climate-related
    factors on growth rates are visually distinguished for 'Rich' and 'Poor' countries,
    showing differences in impacts and distributions.
  11: The paper quantifies the impact of various rainfall characteristics (total rainfall,
    rainfall deviations, wet days) and temperature on the growth rates of different
    economic sectors (agriculture, manufacturing, services).
  12: Coefficients, standard errors, and significance levels for various climate variables
    on economic growth are provided.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis uses a global panel of subnational economic output from 1,554 regions
    worldwide over the past 40 years. It examines the distribution of daily rainfall,
    including thresholds set as constants or percentiles, to assess economic impacts.
    Further, it uses climate data from ERA-5 reanalysis and evaluates standardized
    monthly rainfall anomalies.
  3: "The estimates are obtained via the product of the region-specific marginal effects\
    \ and the region-specific standard deviation for each rainfall measure (from annual\
    \ variability over the historical period 1979\u20132019). The effects from rainfall\
    \ are separately identifiable when included as competing independent variables\
    \ on economic growth rates (see equation (5) in Methods)."
  4: The study assesses the effect of rainfall on economic growth rates by partitioning
    the data based on national income per capita and sector.  Spatial heterogeneity
    is assessed by multiplying regional estimates of marginal effects with historical
    standard deviations of each rainfall measure. A distributed lag model assesses
    the persistence of rainfall impacts.
  5: Regression model with interaction term to account for nonlinear dependence of
    economic response to number of wet days on regional income level.
  6: Fixed-effects panel regression models are used to estimate relationships between
    changes in annual climate measures and subnational per-capita growth rates. The
    analysis uses climate data from 1979-2019 (ERA-5), 1979-2019 (MSWEP), and 1948-2016
    (PGF) and economic data from 1901-2014. Grid-cell values are aggregated to the
    regional level using area-weighted mean of grid cells that fall at least partially
    within the administrative boundaries.
  7: The analysis uses a regression equation (equation 5) with controls for temperature
    variability and a function of annual mean temperature. It assesses heterogeneity
    of rainfall effects by income level, partitioning nations into above- and below-medium
    income per capita. The marginal effects are calculated as the first derivative
    of the regression equation with respect to each rainfall measure and evaluated
    at the sample or regional mean of the moderating variable.
  8: Historical means (1979-2019) of four rainfall measures were mapped globally.
    Monthly rainfall deviations are weighted annual sums of anomalies from climatological
    means. Extreme daily rainfall is the annual sum of rainfall exceeding the 99.9th
    percentile of the historical distribution.
  9: The analysis calculates the standard deviation of annual values for each of the
    four rainfall measures over the period 1979-2019.
  10: Economic responses to rainfall are estimated separately for rich and poor countries;
    analysis presented in Figure 2 is extended to differentiate between rich and poor
    countries.

    separately; The analysis presents marginal effects and their confidence intervals,
    along with data distributions using histograms.

    Statistical significance is indicated by asterisks (* p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01).
More Notes:
  3: The heterogeneity in the effects of increases in extreme daily rainfall is best
    described by the annual mean temperature. The paper explores the independence
    and interdependence of different rainfall measures. Maps are used to visualize
