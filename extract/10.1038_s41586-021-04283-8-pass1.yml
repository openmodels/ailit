Drivers of Risk:
  1: Anthropogenic intensification of daily rainfall extremes
  3: Shocks in annual total rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days,
    and extreme daily rainfall.
  4: Extreme daily rainfall, Number of wet days, Monthly positive rainfall deviations,
    Monthly negative rainfall deviations, Annual total rainfall
  5: Shocks or changes impacting outcomes include deviations of monthly rainfall and
    extreme daily rainfall.
  7: Extreme daily rainfall and annual mean temperature, day-to-day temperature variability,
    number of wet days.
  10: Changes in rainfall (total annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number
    of wet days, extreme daily rainfall)
  11: Total annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days, and
    annual mean temperature.
  12: Daily temperature variability (T_var), annual mean temperature (T_mean), changes
    in annual rainfall, changes in monthly rainfall deviations, extreme daily rainfall,
    number of wet days.
Highlights:
  1: High-income nations and the services and manufacturing sectors are most strongly
    hindered by both measures of daily rainfall.
  3: Findings show competing and complementary effects of different rainfall measures
    on growth rates, suggesting distinct, additive impacts.
  4: The effects of both number of wet days and extreme daily rainfall are strongest
    in winter and autumn; seasonal economic vulnerability rather than differing seasonal
    characteristics of rainfall.
  5: The paper highlights that extreme daily rainfall and the number of wet days are
    adverse for economic growth, particularly in high-income countries via the manufacturing
    and services sectors.
  7: The study strengthens the interpretation of rainfall effects as independent and
    additive. It considers nonlinear effects of the number of wet days and income
    levels. It assesses the heterogeneity of rainfall impacts using country income
    levels.
  10: The impact of rainfall changes on economic growth differs between rich and poor
    countries.
  11: Sectoral growth rates are affected by rainfall and temperature changes. The
    magnitude and uncertainty of these effects are visualized through response curves
    with confidence intervals for agricultural, manufacturing, and service sectors.
  12: The table presents regression coefficients indicating the impact of temperature
    and rainfall variables on economic growth rates, with significance levels (p<0.01,
    p<0.05, p<0.1).
Methodology:
  1: Assess higher-order moments of the annual distribution of daily rainfall in conjunction
    with subnational economic output using a threshold approach, counting both the
    number of days and the amount of rainfall above critical thresholds (constants
    or percentiles of the historical distribution).
  3: "Estimates obtained via product of region-specific marginal effects and standard\
    \ deviation for each rainfall measure over 1979\u20132019. Analysis performed\
    \ using independent variables on economic growth rates with robustness tests."
  4: Regression analysis partitioning data based on national income per capita and
    assessing sector specific economic output; Distributed lag model to assess persistence
    of climate impacts on economic growth.
  5: The analysis reassesses effects separately on sectoral economic output and aligns
    data by national income. It considers interdependencies between different rainfall
    measures and assesses their effects on rich and poor countries.
  7: Panel regression analysis is performed, partitioning data by income level (above-
    and below-medium income per capita) to assess heterogeneity. The regressions include
    controls for temperature variability and function of annual mean temperature.
    Marginal effects are calculated as the first derivative of equation (5) and are
    evaluated at the sample or regional mean of the moderating variable.
  10: "Estimation of economic responses to rainfall for rich and poor countries separately.\
    \ The effect on growth rate is measured as the marginal effect per 1\xB0C increase\
    \ for different climate variables."
  11: The paper estimates economic responses to rainfall for the agricultural, manufacturing,
    and service sectors separately, showing the marginal effects on growth rates from
    changes in various climate variables.
  12: Econometric specification with regression analysis, controlling for temperature
    and rainfall variables. First differences and one-year lags are used. Results
    are clustered regionally and nationally. The analysis uses 3,011 observations.
More Notes:
  1: The study uses surface precipitation rate from the European Centre for Medium-Range
    Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA-5) of historical observations.
  4: "The study assesses the spatial heterogeneity in the magnitude of historical\
    \ impacts from rainfall by multiplying regional estimates of the marginal effects\
    \ with the historical standard deviation of each measure (1979\u20132019)."
  7: The code and data used in the analysis are publicly available at specified repositories.
    The study received funding from the Volkswagen Foundation and the Horizon 2020
    Framework Programme of the European Union.
  10: The graphs present the marginal effects of climate variables on growth rates,
    suggesting a statistical relationship rather than a definitive causal link.
  11: The legend indicates which line colour corresponds to which sector (agriculture,
    manufacturing, services, and one unspecified). The X-axis variables differ in
    each panel, referring to total rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, the number
    of wet days, and annual mean temperature.
  12: The coefficients are presented twice, once for errors clustered regionally and
    once for errors clustered nationally, allowing for a comparison of the robustness
    of the findings across different clustering assumptions.

  1: Economic growth rates are reduced by increases in the number of wet days and
    in extreme daily rainfall, in addition to responding nonlinearly to the total

  5: The paper discusses the impact of rainfall changes on economic growth, particularly
    noting adverse effects from increases in extreme daily rainfall and the number
    of wet days on high-income countries, and via the manufacturing and services sectors.
