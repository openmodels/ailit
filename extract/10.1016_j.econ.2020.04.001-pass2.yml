Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change scenarios proposed by the IPCC leading to changes in temperature
    and precipitation patterns
  3: Changes in rainfall and temperature responsible for climate change will impact
    the level of agricultural productivity in a heterogeneous way.
  4: Climate change negatively impacts agricultural production.
  6: Decrease in agricultural productivity as a result of climate change is the primary
    driver of risk.
  7: Differential pay and yield of land types influences the conversion of land between
    different uses.
  8: The primary drivers of risk are changes in precipitation and temperature impacting
    agricultural productivity, specifically analyzed through the A1B climate change
    scenario from the IPCC's 4th report.
  9: Negative shock of land productivity, understood to be due to climate change;
    impacts on temperature and rainfall.
  10: Climate change impacting crop area, pasture, planted forest, and natural forest.
  11: Changes in rainfall and temperature due to climate change, leading to decreased
    agricultural productivity.
  12: Climate change impacts on agricultural production
  13: Changes in rainfall and temperature leading to decreased agricultural productivity.
  15: Changes in land use, influenced by economic factors such as the remuneration
    of land and land supply elasticity.
  16: Changes in the remuneration of agriculture relative to pasture (demand side).
  17: Changes in elasticities of land supply and substitution of primary factors are
    drivers of risk, particularly impacting agriculture production in specified regions.
Highlights:
  1: "Climate change leads to a loss in real GDP in the Legal Amazon, decreased agricultural\
    \ production and employment, and increased deforestation. The states of Mato Grosso,\
    \ Tocantins, and Par\xE1 are most affected."
  3: Climate change has great potential to trigger significant costs in the Brazilian
    economy especially in agriculture and the Northern region where it concentrates
    a larger portion of the Legal Amazon.
  4: Climate change is projected to negatively impact agricultural productivity in
    Brazil, particularly in the Legal Amazon region. The Legal Amazon plays a significant
    role in the national GDP.
  6: Highlights the importance of evaluating the economic impacts of decreased agricultural
    productivity due to climate change in the Legal Amazon.
  7: The land use module in REGIA models the impact of land conversion between different
    sectors (agriculture, pasture, planted forest, natural forest) driven by economic
    incentives and constrained by land availability, legal reserves, and preservation
    areas.
  8: The analysis captures a portion of the impact of climate change on the Legal
    Amazon, considering only the effects of variations in average accumulated precipitation
    and average temperature on agricultural productivity. The study uses a recursive
    dynamics model to assess the cumulative deviations from a baseline scenario without
    climate change.
  9: A decline in land productivity leads to increased production costs, higher market
    prices, and decreased production. Regions with economies focused on agriculture-export
    activities will be most affected. There is a potential expansion of the agricultural
    frontier to compensate for decreased soil productivity, leading to deforestation.
  10: Climate change is projected to decrease natural forest area by 0.90 million
    hectares and pasture area by 1.06 million hectares across the Legal Amazon region
    by 2030-2049, while increasing agriculture by 2.10 million hectares based on the
    paper's data aggregated for the Amazon Legal region.
  11: "Climate change will negatively impact agricultural production in the Legal\
    \ Amazon, with sugar cane, soybeans, maize, sugar cane and rice being particularly\
    \ affected. The mesoregion MetropolitanadeBel\xE9m is particularly vulnerable.\
    \ Soybean and cotton production decreases will significantly impact the economies\
    \ of Norte Mato-grossense and Nordeste Mato-grossense. Cassava production decline\
    \ will affect food security."
  12: Climate change is projected to negatively impact agricultural production in
    most mesoregions of the Brazilian Amazon, leading to negative effects on key macroeconomic
    variables such as GDP, family consumption, and investment at the state and Legal
    Amazon levels. Some crops in specific regions can benefit from climate change.
  13: Mato Grosso and Tocantins are the most affected states due to their greater
    dependence on agricultural activities.
  17: Aggregate results for regions, such as GDP, investment, and household consumption,
    are robust to variations in elasticities, with some sensitivity in investment
    results towards the end of the simulated period (2040-2050).
Methodology:
  1: Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, REGIA - Inter-regional General Equilibrium
    Model for the Brazilian Legal Amazon; analysis applicable for 2030-2049
  4: The map depicts projected effects of climate change on agricultural production
    from 2030 to 2049.
  6: Uses a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to evaluate the economic impacts
    of climate change on a large scale, both regionally and sectorally. Specifically,
    it uses the REGIA model, an inter-regional CGE bottom-up structure of the Johansen
    type encompassing 30 mesoregions of the Legal Amazon plus the rest of Brazil.
  7: The REGIA model is a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model with a land use
    module. The land use module allows for conversion between agricultural, pasture,
    and planted forest land uses, controlled by a transition matrix. The model uses
    a constant elasticity of transformation (CET) function to allocate land between
    different agricultural sectors.
  8: A CGE (Computable General Equilibrium) model is used to simulate the effects
    of climate change on agricultural productivity. The analysis is performed for
    Brazil, specifically focusing on the Legal Amazon and the rest of the country,
    across the period 2030-2049, divided into four 5-year periods. Two model closures
    (historical/baseline and policy) are used.
  9: The REGIA model is used to simulate the effects of climate change by comparing
    a baseline scenario with a scenario that includes climate change effects. The
    land-use mechanism projects land use dynamics considering the total available
    area, productivity of each region, and the relative profitability of the crops.
  10: The analysis projects changes in land use (crop area, pasture, planted forest,
    and natural forest) due to climate change, accumulating the impact over the period
    2030-2049.
  11: The analysis projects percentage variation of agricultural production between
    2030 and 2049 compared to a baseline scenario, focusing on mesoregions within
    the Legal Amazon. The study assesses the effects of climate change on pasture
    and planted forest areas.
  12: The analysis simulates the impact of climate change on agricultural production
    by mesoregion and crop, then models the macroeconomic effects at the state and
    Legal Amazon region levels. Results are applicable to the period 2030-2049 relative
    to a base scenario.
  13: Simulation of the effects of productivity decrease due to climatic changes on
    agricultural crops in the Brazilian Legal Amazon from 2030 to 2049 to project
    impacts on land use and economic indicators.
  15: The paper uses a transition matrix approach, calibrated with TerraClass satellite
    data (2008 and 2010) and agricultural census data (1995 and 2006), to model land
    use changes between agriculture, pasture, planted forest, and unused land in the
    Brazilian Legal Amazon. The matrix indicates how land use changes over time and
    is adjusted for changes in the remuneration of land according to a CET function
    and land supply elasticity.
  16: The transition matrix is adjusted annually, as is the supply of land, based
    on the remuneration of agriculture vs. pasture. The REGIA model is used.
  17: The analysis uses the REGIA model and employs a systematic sensitivity analysis
    with the Gaussian quadrature methodology, focusing on elasticities of land supply
    and substitution of primary factors.
More Notes:
  1: Deforestation increases due to replacement of pasture with crop fields.
  4: The Legal Amazon is a heterogeneous region with diverse economic activities,
    including agriculture, forestry, mining, and industry. The region's economic dynamics
    are essential for formulating climate change adaptation policies. The effect of
    climate change is heterogenous within Brazil.
  6: The REGIA model incorporates land use change (ILUC) and is suitable for analyzing
    the dynamics of decreased agricultural productivity. The model focuses on how
    the impacts of global warming on agricultural production will occur in a disparate
    manner across the Legal Amazon.
  7: The model removes Legal Reserve (RL) and Permanent Preservation Areas (APPs)
    from available land to calculate the elasticity of land use supply. The model
    incorporates regional information from sources like IBGE, RAIS, SECEX and POF.
    The REGIA database has a matrix structure of 31 regions and 27 sectors.
  8: The study acknowledges several limitations, including not incorporating other
    effects of climate change such as floods, storms, droughts, savanization, shocks
    over other sectors, or advances in technology. The results should be read as accumulated
    deviations from the baseline scenario where climate change did not occur.
  9: The model takes into account the integration of regional trade and the productive
    structure of the regions. The REGIA model deducts from the available area the
    areas of environmental preservation for the calculation of the supply elasticity
    that guides the allocation of different types of land use.
  10: The study focuses on the Legal Amazon region of Brazil. The effects are quantified
    in terms of changes in land area, not direct economic costs or benefits. The maps
    indicate spatial variation in percentage changes for natural forest and agriculture.
  11: The conversion of pasture to cropland is identified as a key response to declining
    agricultural productivity. The study compares the impact on pasture, planted forest
    and deforestation.
  12: The paper also mentions the reduction of livestock production, mainly cattle,
    and in smaller part milk, pork and poultry, due to the loss of pasture area.
  13: There will be a gradual replacement of pasture areas (-0.3%) and natural forest
    (-0.3%) for cropping areas (0.6%).
  16: The REGIA model is used to analyze regions within Brazil. The table of land
    supply elasticities provides a regional breakdown.

  5: This page primarily describes the agricultural, livestock, mineral, and industrial
    sectors of the Legal Amazon region in Brazil, without explicitly linking these
    activities to climate change risks, adaptation costs/benefits, or macroeconomic/fiscal
    outcomes. The page also references the role of the public administration sector
    in the Legal Amazon region.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Real GDP, agricultural production, land use, job creation
  2: GDP effects, employment, income, consumption, migration flows, and food security
    are affected by changes in agricultural productivity.
  3: This work aims to fill the gap in the literature to measure the impacts of climate
    change at the most disaggregated regional level possible, because the effects
    of climate change are heterogeneous regionally and among economic sectors.
  4: Agricultural productivity (per hectare) is negatively affected by climate change.
    GDP of the Legal Amazon region is mentioned as an economic aspect.
  6: Economic impacts of the decrease in agricultural productivity due to climate
    change.
  7: The model implicitly considers GDP effects through sectoral linkages and land
    use changes impacting agricultural and forestry production. Deforestation (decrease
    in natural forest area) is a proxy for measuring expansion of agriculture or forestry.
  8: The study focuses on the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity
    and its subsequent effects on the economy, without directly measuring macroeconomic
    outcomes such as GDP effects, inflation, or fiscal variables, instead considering
    accumulated deviations from a baseline scenario where climate change did not occur.
  9: GDP effects, employment levels, household consumption, and price changes. Specifically,
    the impacts on the level of activity of each mesoregion are assessed.
  10: No relevant information
  11: GDP effects are indicated, specifically related to decreases in soybean and
    cotton production in Norte Mato-grossense and Nordeste Mato-grossense mesoregions.
    Mention of impacts on the food security of vulnerable family farmers through decreased
    cassava production.
  12: GDP effects; Family consumption; Investment; Government consumption; Exports;
    Imports
  13: Decrease in household consumption, government spending, investment, exports,
    imports, GDP, employment, and real wages in the Legal Amazon region due to climate
    change.
  16: Land supply elasticities, conversion from pasture to agriculture.
Quantitative material:
  1: Loss in real GDP in the Legal Amazon of 1.18% in 2049
  2: Average reduction of productivity by 18% nationally, but with a wide regional
    variation (-40% to + 15%).
  4: GDP of the Legal Amazon was R$136.7 billion in 2010, representing 8.1% of the
    national GDP. There's a map showing the percentage effect of climate change on
    Brazilian agricultural production per hectare at a municipal level (2030 to 2049).
  7: The model uses a transition matrix and supply elasticity to determine land use
    conversion.
  9: It models changes in land use (agriculture, pasture, planted forest, and natural
    forest) in millions of hectares, and percentage variation in deforestation rate
    between 2030 and 2049.
  10: Table 1 presents accumulated values (2030-2049) in millions of hectares for
    changes in crop area, pasture, planted forest, and natural forest in specific
    mesoregions and states within the Legal Amazon region of Brazil, including the
    total impact across the Amazon Legal region.
  11: "Drop of 11.34% in sugar cane production in the Legal Amazon region. Average\
    \ production decrease of soybeans, maize, sugar cane, and rice of 20.2% in relation\
    \ to the reference scenario in the mesoregion MetropolitanadeBel\xE9m. Decreases\
    \ of 6.2% of soybean production in Norte Mato-grossense and 5.4% in Nordeste Mato-grossense,\
    \ and decreases of 1.3% and 1.07% respectively for cotton production. Decline\
    \ of 1.14% in cassava production in the Legal Amazon region."
  12: Table 3 provides cumulative percentage deviation between 2030 and 2049 related
    to the base scenario for macroeconomic variables by state and Legal Amazon region,
    including Family Consumption, Investment, Government Consumption, Exports, Imports,
    and GDP.
  13: Average accumulated decrease in GDP for Mato Grosso is 2.00% and Tocantins is
    1.69% between 2030 and 2049 in relation to the base scenario (Legal Amazon average
    decrease of 1.18%).
  15: "The paper provides transition matrices for Brazil and Sudeste do Par\xE1, showing\
    \ land use changes in million hectares. For example, approximately 10 million\
    \ hectares of pasture have been converted to agriculture land in Brazil and about\
    \ 70 thousand hectares of pasture have been converted to agriculture in Sudeste\
    \ do Par\xE1."
