Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on cholera incidence.
  2: Increased temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns as a result of climate
    change, leading to an increased risk of diarrheal diseases like cholera.
  4: Climate variables impacting cholera in Tanzania.
  5: Cholera cases show a seasonal pattern, with higher cases during periods of higher
    temperatures and rainfall, indicating climate change impacts.
  6: Climate change (inferred from the scenario comparison), diarrheal diseases, cholera,
    economic development (GDP, socio-economic factors)
  10: Climate change leading to increased cholera cases.
  11: Climate change leading to increased cholera cases and deaths; specifically,
    temperature increases are correlated with cholera cases.
  12: Temperature increase (1 degree Celsius and 2 degrees Celsius scenarios).
  13: Climate change leading to increased incidence of cholera and related diseases.
  14: Climate variability, specifically temperature increases, impacting the incidence
    of cholera.
  15: Increased temperatures (1 to 2 degrees Celsius by 2030), impacting cholera incidence
  16: Climate change leading to an increased burden of diarrheal diseases.
Highlights:
  2: The results provide insights into national-level estimates of the implications
    of climate change on the health sector and inform debates on financing and planning
    adaptation.
  4: Estimation of future cholera burden due to climate change in Tanzania provides
    a basis for estimating total costs attributable to climate change.
  5: Major cholera outbreak in September 2004, peaking over 2800 cases, indicates
    a clear impact of climate variables on health outcomes.
  6: Economic development is expected to have a positive influence on health sector
    performance, decreasing the relative burden of disease in 2030; Developing countries
    are expected to have constant growth without crises, influencing health outcomes.
  10: The study estimates the cost of reactive adaptation measures to address cholera
    outbreaks, including treatment costs, productivity losses, and the value of lost
    lives.
  11: Cholera cases in Tanzania are positively correlated with temperature. An increase
    in temperature increases the relative risk for cholera cases. The GDP share of
    total cost in Tanzania by 2030 is calculated.
  12: Reactive adaptation costs for cholera management can be reduced by 44-47% if
    the temperature increase is limited to 1 degree Celsius instead of 2 degrees Celsius.
  13: Loss of lives constitutes 90% of total costs; even without the value of lost
    lives, illness costs represent 0.03 to 0.13 percent of GDP.
  14: The estimated cost of reactive adaptation to climate change-induced cholera
    in Tanzania by 2030 is 0.03-0.12% of GDP. This is considered a reasonable estimate
    given existing data and projections.
  15: Loss of lives accounts for 90 percent of total costs of cholera attributable
    to climate change.
  16: The cost estimates are considerably higher than current budgets allocated for
    diarrheal diseases in developing countries.
Methodology:
  1: The paper is a study focusing on Tanzania, and it's published in 2011.
  2: The study integrates historical data on temperature and rainfall with cholera
    incidence in Tanzania, using socioeconomic data to control for impacts of general
    development.
  4: Analysis based on historical data of cholera cases and deaths, as well as climate
    variables like rainfall and temperature; projections of future cholera burden
    attributable to climate change by 2030 in Tanzania.
  5: Analysis follows the methodological framework suggested by Chiabai et al., focusing
    on climate change, population growth, and economic development predictions; it
    uses econometric analyses with data limited by the number of observations.
  6: Downscaling regional projections of diarrheal deaths to the country level, using
    the percentage contribution of each country to the regional burden of disease;
    Calculating cholera deaths based on the proportion of cholera deaths to diarrheal
    deaths in Tanzania (based on WHO data); Estimating cholera cases based on deaths
    and a case fatality rate.
  10: Reactive adaptation costs are calculated by multiplying the number of climate
    change-attributable cholera cases by the unit cost per case; Productivity losses
    are calculated from daily wages multiplied by days out of work; A GDP-adjusted
    VOSL method is used to account for loss of lives.
  11: Correlation analysis of cholera cases with temperature and rainfall. Calculation
    of total economic costs of cholera attributable to climate change by totaling
    the costs of reactive adaptation and impacts after preventive adaptation. Costs
    of impacts are estimated from cases (productivity losses) and deaths.
  12: Estimates are based on projected cholera cases and deaths attributable to climate
    change in 2030, using different temperature increase scenarios and considering
    both annual and monthly datasets to derive lower and upper boundaries.
  13: "Projection based on scenarios of 1\xB0C and 2\xB0C temperature increase by\
    \ 2030 and linkage of cholera cases to environmental and socioeconomic factors."
  14: Econometric analyses of long-term datasets, cost estimation based on Tanzanian
    Ministry of Health data, and comparison with other studies. Cost estimates for
    preventative measures are not included as they are assumed to be implemented with
    general socio-economic development.
  15: Cost calculations considering the impacts of autonomous adaptation at the individual,
    household or even community levels were not considered; GDP-adjusted Value of
    Statistical Life (VOSL) included in the estimate of total costs of cholera attributable
    to climate change
  16: The study performs a national-level assessment, taking into account expected
    future economic development in Tanzania, including strengthening of the health
    system.

  1: The DOI (10.3390/ijerph8124386) can be used to locate the full paper and obtain
    further details.
  6: The CFR of 0.078 from the econometric analysis was not reliable, so the WHO average
    of 0.0318 was used. The study projects diarrheal diseases and cholera in Tanzania.
    The rainfall graph informs seasonality relevant to disease spread and should be
    cross-referenced with the model.
  11: The costs of preventive measures are not included in the calculations as they
    are assumed to be implemented in line with Tanzania's national development objectives.  Seasonality
    is addressed using a dummy variable for drought months. The study considers productivity
    losses and deaths as key economic impacts of cholera.
  12: The analysis focuses on the costs of reactive adaptation, not proactive adaptation.
    The results are specific to cholera and its management, and do not reflect other
    climate change impacts or adaptation strategies.
  14: The reliability of econometric analyses is limited due to data limitations.
    The study assumes Tanzania will meet its goal of near-universal water and sanitation
    coverage by 2025, which would impact the costs of preventive measures.
  15: The paper acknowledges limitations and distributional impacts of adaptation
    measures are often challenged, and people with low bargaining power tend to be
    the last to receive benefits
  16: The study emphasizes the need to quantify the burden of disease at national
    and local levels, as opposed to regional levels, due to varying vulnerabilities.

Quantitative material:
  1: The paper is published in the International Journal of Environmental Research
    and Public Health, suggesting it may contain quantitative analysis related to
    cholera costs.
  2: For a 1 degree Celsius temperature increase, the initial relative risk of cholera
    increases by 15 to 29 percent.
  5: Cholera case data from 1977 to 2004, with detailed monthly aggregation from 1998
    to 2004, showing fluctuations and a major outbreak in 2004.
  10: Cost of treating a cholera patient admitted to a hospital is US$98; Weighted
    average wage (including self-employed, formal employees, and unemployed) is used
    to calculate productivity losses; Productivity loss is calculated as daily wage
    multiplied by five working days; A US VOSL of USD 4 million is adjusted for Tanzania
    using the ratio of real per capita GDP and purchasing power parity.
  11: 'Value of Statistical Life (VOSL) for Tanzania: USD 32,958.  Risk ratio: A 1
    degree Celsius increase in temperature increases the relative risk for cholera
    cases in Tanzania by 29 percent (using monthly data) or 15 percent (using annual
    regional panel data).'
  12: Annual costs of reactive adaptation measures range from USD 5.5 million to USD
    10.5 million in the optimistic scenario (1 degree Celsius) and from USD 11.7 million
    to USD 24 million in the pessimistic scenario (2 degree Celsius).
  13: 'Annual costs of cholera due to climate change by 2030: between 64,069,209 USD
    and 283,655,743 USD; productivity losses account for approximately 11-13% of total
    costs.'
  14: A 1 degree Celsius increase in temperatures is associated with a 0.05 to 0.1
    percentage point increase in cholera incidences for Tanzania.
  15: Cholera health cost of increased temperatures will be in the range of 0.03 to
    0.12 percent of GDP for treatment costs alone; total additional cost attributable
    to climate change, including productivity losses and the value of lost lives averages
    out at greater than 0.12% of GDP.
  16: The cost of treating additional diarrheal diseases attributable to climate change
    may be as much as 1.4 percent of GDP by 2030.
