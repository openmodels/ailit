    index, which considers exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity related to
    health, food, ecosystems, habitat, water, and infrastructure sectors to assess
    vulnerability.

Highlights:
  1: It emphasizes the importance of understanding how asymmetric sovereign risk impacts
    fiscal stability in the context of climate change adaptation.
  5: Sovereign risk reacts asymmetrically to its determinants. Climate change preparedness
    is effective in mitigating sovereign risk for countries with low spreads and long-term
    debt. Climate change vulnerability has a stronger impact on spreads than the actual
    occurrence of natural disasters.
  6: Climate change vulnerability significantly impacts shorter-term debt maturities,
    especially for high-risk countries with elevated borrowing costs.
  8: External factors consistently significantly impact sovereign risk across different
    spread segments. The effects of variables such as economic shocks are greater
    in short-term maturities and for higher quantiles of spreads.
  9: Comprehensive overview of the literature linking sovereign debt and climate change
    risk; challenges and opportunities faced by developed and emerging economies as
    they grapple with the consequences of climate change through fiscal and policy
    measures.
  10: For longer-term maturities, climate change vulnerability impacts low-risk countries
    more.
  11: Vulnerability to climate change disproportionately affects emerging and low-income
    developing countries' borrowing costs; natural disasters have modest effects compared
    to climate change vulnerability and readiness.
  15: RF is used due to its ability to handle complex and nonlinear relationships
    in data, which is important for capturing different fragments of sovereign yield
    spread distributions. RF's capability to handle both categorical and continuous
    variables makes it preferable to linear factor-based models.
  19: Panel quantile models are essential for estimating the direct effects of economic
    and climate-related determinants on sovereign credit spreads, accounting for unobserved
    heterogeneity between countries. A single factor can adequately capture the variation
    in the common dynamics affecting sovereign credit spreads globally.
  23: Some countries, like Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom, have exhibited
    lower sovereign spreads than those of the United States. Emerging nations have
    consistently maintained positive spreads. Natural disasters could affect sovereign
    spreads, and repeated exposure to such disasters may incentivize a country to
    enhance its preparedness for future occurrences.
  28: Higher debt-to-GDP ratio, inflation, and increased vulnerability to climate
    change contribute to higher spreads across all maturities. Improved institutions
    contribute to lower spreads.
  29: Heightened preparedness for climate change adaptation contributes to lower sovereign
    risk spreads. Vulnerability to climate change and inflation have substantial positive
    effects on sovereign risk. The impact of inflation on sovereign risk is well documented,
    particularly in its erosion of the real value of bonds, with longer-term debt
    instruments being more significantly affected.
  30: Higher inflation increases sovereign risk, and this effect is more pronounced
    when sovereign risk is already high (90th quantile). The debt-to-GDP ratio is
    generally non-significant at short maturities in most specifications, and when
    significant, its effect is relatively modest.
  31: A distinct positive relationship between vulnerability and sovereign risk, comparable
    in magnitude to the effect of inflation.
  32: Climate change vulnerability positively influences sovereign borrowing costs.
    Climate change readiness can offset the positive effects of vulnerability on borrowing
    costs.
  33: Market prices climate risk for short-term maturities, particularly for countries
    with riskier profiles. Climate change vulnerability acts as a rollover risk for
    high-risk countries but poses a long-term solvency risk for advanced economies.
    Climate change preparation can mitigate the exposure to climate risk, especially
    at longer maturities and lower quantiles of spreads.
  34: The effects of the determinants of sovereign yield spreads vary across quantiles
    of the spreads distribution, suggesting that climate change risks are different
    for emerging and low-income countries compared to advanced economies. Climate
    change preparation can have mitigating effects.
  35: Economic complexity is a reliable predictor of future fiscal crises and economies
    with higher complexity experience lower borrowing costs. The impact of economic
    complexity is more pronounced for higher quantiles. Annual real growth rate of
    economies is significant across all maturities and quantiles.
  36: Terms of trade have a consistently significant negative impact, while natural
    resource rents result in a marginal increase in spreads but often lack statistical
    significance.
  37: Institutional quality (Rule of Law) is a statistically significant determinant
    of long-maturity yield spreads at lower quantiles; quantile regressions are used
    to analyze yield spreads and are robust to outliers.
  39: The correlation within categories of disaster measurement is high, but the correlation
    between different ways of measuring the effects of disasters is low.
  40: Incorporation of natural disasters improves the model, particularly for 5-year
    maturities (though the provided excerpt only shows results for 1 and 2 year spreads).
    Rule of Law becomes significant on five occasions.
  41: Natural disasters are generally insignificant across quantiles and maturities.
  43: Increases in disasters in the third category lead to higher spreads in six cases.
    Surprisingly, higher deaths and population affected by disasters often lead to
    negative effects on spreads. Effects are generally small (below 4%) except for
    a few cases.
  44: Climate change poses asymmetric risk to emerging and low-income developing countries,
    disproportionately affecting high quantiles of the spread distribution; responses
    to determinants of sovereign spreads are asymmetric.
  45: Readiness indicators reduce sovereign risk at long-term maturities, but effects
    are smaller in high-spread countries with short-term debt.
  46: Climate change vulnerability can increase borrowing costs for European countries,
    particularly in longer maturities; An increase in natural disasters could shift
    the entire spread distribution upward, exacerbating sovereign risk; Preparation
    is insufficient to counterbalance vulnerability impacts, requiring additional
    measures like enhancing productive structure
  47: Adaptation to climate change and its macro-fiscal implications as noted by Aligishiev,
    Massetti, and Bellon (2022).
  55: The figure illustrates the extent of missing data for sovereign spreads across
    different countries and maturities. This data availability issue impacted the
    inclusion of countries and maturities in the subsequent analysis.
Methodology:
  4: Working paper; The opinions expressed in this work are those of the authors and
    do not necessarily reflect the views of the Inter-American Development Bank, its
    Board of Directors, or the countries they represent.
  5: Panel-quantile regressions are used to analyze the relationship between sovereign
    risk, disaster risk, preparedness, and vulnerability. Applicable to countries
    with varying levels of credit spreads and debt structures.
  6: Novel and comprehensive empirical framework to evaluate the effects of variables
    across the entire conditional spread distribution.
  8: Empirical assessment involves including a common international factor in models
    to examine its impact on country-specific risk across different segments of the
    spread distribution and maturities. The research looks into how different maturities
    of sovereign yields and spreads respond to economic shocks.
  9: Analysis involves exploration of financial costs, investigation of green bonds,
    and projections of GDP and fiscal losses using data on emissions, energy sources,
    and fiscal revenue.
  10: The analysis uses a sample of 68 countries (N=68).
  11: Analysis incorporates sovereign spread distributions and determinants influenced
    by climate change, including the occurrence of natural disasters, and relates
    these to various macroeconomic factors.
  12: Panel quantile regression framework enhanced by incorporating common unobservable
    factors (factor-augmented panel quantile regression); Random forest for imputation
    of missing values
  13: The paper develops a model to impute missing sovereign yield data using mixture
    distributions with fixed unobserved effects and a time-varying market factor derived
    from the cross-section of yield spreads via principal component analysis (PCA).
    The methodology allows for sensitivity testing by including more than one factor.
  14: Machine learning approach (Random Forest) to maximize dataset size for sovereign
    risk models; trained on data from 2000 to 2019; incorporates 66 variables related
    to spread dynamics.
  15: Uses Random Forest (RF) to complete missing data for variables predicting sovereign
    yield spreads, treating missing values as the target variable. Aims to accurately
    characterize spreads for countries in years with missing data and predict them
    when data is absent.
  16: The analysis involves imputing missing data using a Random Forest (RF) model
    based on observed variables, followed by a Factor-Augmented Panel Quantile Model
    for completed data on different maturities.
  17: Quantile regression models are used, considering both distribution-free and
    likelihood-based methods.

    common factor, factor-based approach to capture global macroeconomic forces.
  20: The study uses panel-quantile models and a Random Forest (RF) approach to analyze
    data.
  23: The analysis incorporates macroeconomic, fiscal, and institutional covariates
    to address potential confounding factors. The analysis excludes the years 2020
    and 2021.
  24: The paper uses the ND-GAIN index and its constituent elements to assess climate
    vulnerability and readiness for adaptation. The ND-GAIN index is broken down into
    vulnerability and readiness dimensions. Vulnerability is further subdivided into
    health, food, ecosystems, habitat, water, and infrastructure sectors, each evaluated
    across exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Readiness is broken down
    into economic, social, and governance categories.
  26: The authors use a Random Forest (RF) imputation method with 100 trees, sampling
    the square root of the number of variables at each split, to address missing data
    in their dataset.
  28: Panel data analysis using quantile regressions. Variables are scaled to have
    zero mean and unitary variance before estimation.
  29: Quantile regression analysis; PCA to construct a common factor representing
    common market shocks
  30: The analysis examines the asymmetric effect of higher inflation on sovereign
    risk across different quantiles of spreads.
  32: Quantile regression analysis is used to determine the determinants of sovereign
    yield spreads at short maturities (1 year and 2 years). The analysis considers
    three quantiles (0.1, 0.5, and 0.9) of the spread distribution. All variables
    are scaled to have zero mean and unit variance.
  33: Quantile regression analysis of sovereign spreads with respect to climate change
    vulnerability.
  34: Quantile regression is used to analyze the determinants of sovereign yield spreads.
    All variables are scaled to have zero mean and unit variance for easier comparison
    of effects. The analysis distinguishes between short- and long-term maturities
    and varying effects across quantiles of spreads distribution.
  35: The paper uses economic complexity and annual real growth rate of economies
    as explanatory variables to explain borrowing costs.
  37: Panel quantile model; quantile regressions are robust to outliers and are constructed
    based on order statistics
  39: The analysis uses correlations among different proxies for natural disasters
    to understand how disaster intensity is measured. The model incorporates three
    disaster variables simultaneously into the location equation of the idiosyncratic
    country-specific components.
  40: The analysis uses a model that explicitly considers the occurrence of natural
    disasters in determining cross-country heterogeneity in sovereign debt markets,
    employing quantile regression.
  41: Modeling outcomes of country-idiosyncratic effects, considering traditional
    country-specific effects and variations in spread distributions due to natural
    disasters. The analysis is applicable to understanding the determinants of sovereign
    yield spreads. Variables are standardized to have zero mean and unit variance.
  43: A model is used with idiosyncratic components modeled as a mixture of three
    distributions. The impact of natural disasters is assessed using country-specific
    variables. Significant coefficients are emphasized.
  44: Models integrate the occurrence of natural disasters into the determination
    of sovereign spreads; analysis differentiates between high (0.9 quantile) and
    low (0.1 quantile) spread distributions.

    institutional, and fiscal variables, highlighting readiness as a factor.

    on public budgets.
  55: The analysis focuses on sovereign spreads. Countries or maturities with a larger
    amount of missing data were excluded from the analysis.
More Notes:
  4: The paper explores the implications of asymmetric sovereign risk for climate
    change preparation in Latin America and the Caribbean; The paper is IDB Working
    Paper Series ; 1588
  5: The study highlights the importance of considering the conditional distribution
    of credit spreads when assessing climate-related sovereign risk. Countries with
    high spreads and short-term debt require additional measures beyond climate change
    readiness to offset vulnerability effects.
  6: The impact of vulnerability, preparedness, and other determinants are not uniform
    across the spread distribution, with adverse effects of climate change disproportionately
    affecting countries with higher spreads and reliance on short-term debt.
  9: The page highlights the role of the Inter-American Development Bank, the International
    Monetary Fund, and the United Nations in contributing to the body of work on sovereign
    risk and climate change.
  13: The paper focuses on addressing missing data in sovereign yield datasets, which
    is a prerequisite for macroeconomic analysis but is not itself focused on the
    impact of climate change. Therefore, this paper contributes a methodology that
    could be applied in a climate change adaptation study, but by itself it does not
    address the outcomes of interest in the review.
  14: The paper addresses the issue of missing data in datasets used for credit risk
    analysis by employing a Random Forest (RF) model to impute missing values.
  19: The inclusion of a time-varying factor is an alternative to explicitly including
    general macro-forces such as the VIX, oil prices, uncertainty, world interest
    rates, TED spreads, and other proxies for global financial cycles, inflation cycles,
    or commodity cycles.
  26: The analysis seems focused on preparing data for further analysis rather than
    presenting final results. The paper imputes spreads at various maturities, which
    are then likely used as inputs in another model, and this particular excerpt is
    focused on the imputation methodology.
  28: All variables demonstrate the expected signs in accordance with theoretical
    expectations.
  29: The effects of explanatory variables are most pronounced in short-term maturities,
    particularly within the highest quantiles of spreads. Individual variables exhibit
    greater explanatory power for the center and left tail of the spread distribution
    for shorter maturities, and on the center and right tail for longer maturities.
  30: The paper focuses on the relationship between inflation, debt-to-GDP ratio,
    and sovereign yield spreads. It highlights the asymmetric impact of inflation
    on sovereign risk across different quantiles of the spread distribution.
  32: The study diverges from Beirne, Renzhi, and Volz (2021) by highlighting the
    importance of climate change readiness in influencing sovereign borrowing costs.
    The effects of readiness generally mirror the magnitude (but with opposite signs)
    of vulnerability effects.
  33: The effect of climate vulnerability on sovereign spreads depends on the maturity
    of the debt and the initial risk profile of the country. Climate change readiness
    provides less attenuation for high-quantile spreads at shorter maturities.
  34: Significant effects are in bold and shadow in the original table.
  37: The study investigates the impact of natural disasters on yield spreads in a
    subsequent section.
  39: The paper uses ndisaster1, ndisaster2, and ndisaster3 to represent different
    categories of disaster measurement, namely number of people affected, number of
    deaths, and percentage of economic loss to GDP, respectively. The paper incorporates
    the three disaster variables into the location equation of the idiosyncratic country-specific
    components of their model as components of z12 in equation 10.
  40: The magnitudes and signs of effects are consistent with a previous model (Table
    3), though some variables gain or lose significance with the inclusion of natural
    disasters.
  41: Significant effects are denoted in bold and shaded. Variables achieving significance
    in the updated model (incorporating natural disasters) are highlighted in green.
    Variables losing significance in the new models are highlighted in red.
  43: The table presents the idiosyncratic components of a model, which are modeled
    as a mixture of three distributions using location parameters, and country-specific
    natural disaster variables. Spreads are higher in six cases due to increments
    in disasters in the third category. Significant coefficients are emphasized with
    bold text and shading, while coefficients associated with natural disasters are
    enclosed within a box.
  44: The model directly examines the impact of natural disasters while accounting
    for key determinants of sovereign debt (macroeconomic, institutional, and fiscal
    variables).
  45: The link between climate change and sovereign risk is influenced by macroeconomic
    and institutional contexts rather than direct effects.
  46: The paper highlights a potential challenge for sustaining climate change funding
    schemes in the long term due to the amplification of climate change effects; It
    also emphasizes the importance of monitoring efforts to minimize systemic risk
    from natural disasters due to climate change.
  55: The paper assesses data availability for sovereign spreads, a proxy for borrowing
    costs, which are potentially impacted by climate-related risks.

Quantitative material:
  5: No specific quantitative estimates are provided on this page, but the study quantifies
    the asymmetric reactions of sovereign risk to its determinants across the conditional
    distribution of credit spreads.
  6: Climate change vulnerability becomes notably significant for shorter maturities,
    especially those equal to or less than two years.
  10: For longer maturities (5-year and 10-year), a one standard deviation increase
    in the climate vulnerability index does not impact the spreads at the 90th and
    50th percentiles but increases the 10th percentile by approximately 13-14%.
  19: The first principal component in the factor model of credit spreads accounts
    for 42.8 percent of the variability in the 272 series of spreads.
  20: There is no specific quantitative information provided on this page.
  21: Quantitative summary statistics for variables like sovereign spreads, GDP growth,
    inflation rate, etc.
  23: The minimum spread is negative across all maturities. The average spreads are
    notably higher in the short term (especially the 2-year spreads) compared to the
    medium (5-year) and long-term (10-year) maturities. The sample consists of 68
    countries, roughly 44 percent of which are advanced and the remaining 56 percent
    are emerging or low-income developing nations.
  28: The figure summarizes the effects of all determinants across spreads quantiles
    and maturities using scaled variables (zero mean and unitary variance).
  29: The common factor's magnitude ranges between -3 and -6 percent
  30: Inflation's impact on 1-year spreads falls from 0.27 to 0.17-0.18 when transitioning
    from the 90th quantile to the 50th and 10th quantiles. For the 2-year spread,
    this decreases from 0.21 to 0.12 to 0.08. For 10-year maturities, the effects
    diminish from 0.20 to 0.13 to 0.09 as we transition from the 90th quantile to
    the 50th and 10th quantile. The effect of the debt-to-GDP ratio ranges between
    8 and 11 percent for the median and 90th quantile of the 2-year spread, and between
    6 and 8 percent for the lower quantiles of the 10-year spread.
  32: Table 3 presents estimates, standard errors, z-values, and p-values for the
    impact of climate change vulnerability and readiness on 1-year and 2-year sovereign
    yield spreads at the 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 quantiles of the spread distribution. For
    example, a one unit increase in vulnerability leads to a 0.14 increase in the
    1-year spread at the 0.9 quantile, with a p-value of 0.01. A one unit increase
    in readiness leads to a -0.15 decrease in the 1-year spread at the 0.9 quantile,
    with a p-value of 0.00.
  33: 'Impact of vulnerability on 1- and 2-year yield spreads at highest quantile:
    0.14 and 0.27; Impact of vulnerability on 5- and 10-year yield spreads at lowest
    quantiles: 0.12 and 0.13'
  34: Table provides estimates, standard errors, z-values, and p-values for the impact
    of the drivers of risk on 5-year and 10-year sovereign yield spreads at the 0.1,
    0.5, and 0.9 quantiles of the spread distribution.
  35: The effects of economic complexity on borrowing costs range between -0.24 and
    -0.07 across various maturities and quantiles. The effect of real growth rate
    on borrowing costs ranges between -5 and -10%.
  36: Terms of trade impact quantitative range is from -4% to -10%.
  37: 'Examples of 1-year spread results at the 0.9 quantile: first group centers
    around spreads with a mean of zero, second encompasses countries close to spreads
    around 0.36 standard deviations, and a high-risk group clusters around 1.17 standard
    deviations; estimated location parameters consistently shift to the left, and
    the groups cluster around negative values at the 0.1 quantile.'
  39: The correlation between disasters estimated as a percentage of economic loss
    to GDP (category 3), the number of deaths (category 2), or the number of people
    affected (category 1) is low. The correlation between disasters in category 1
    and category 2 is 0.22; between category 2 and category 3 is 0.17 and it is 0.23
    between the second and third categories.
  40: Estimates, standard errors, z-values, and p-values for the impact of the drivers
    of risk on sovereign debt spreads at different quantiles (0.9, 0.5, 0.1) for 1-year
    and 2-year maturities.
  41: The table shows the impact of the determinants on sovereign yield spreads across
    maturities of 5 and 10 years, presented in quantiles (0.1, 0.5, and 0.9). Includes
    coefficients, standard errors, and t-statistics for each determinant.
  42: The page provides quantitative estimates, standard errors, z-values, and p-values
    for various components and natural disaster impacts on macroeconomic variables
    over 1, 2, and 5-year spreads.
  43: The table provides spread changes at the 90th, 50th, and 10th percentiles over
    a 10-year period, broken down by different components and natural disaster categories.
    Some disaster variable coefficients are presented.
  44: Spreads predominantly react to vulnerability and readiness to climate change
    as a general concept, rather than the actual occurrence of natural disasters.
  46: Modest impact of natural disasters on sovereign risk, positive relation between
    natural disasters and economic losses to GDP
  55: Shows the frequency of missing observations per country for the different sovereign
    spread maturities (1Y, 2Y, 5Y, 10Y) with a range of 0 to 20 missing years. The
    total number of years in the sample is 20.
