Drivers of Risk:
  3: Climate change impacts exceeding the capacity of adaptation efforts.
  10: Physical constraints (geographical features), governance, institutional and
    policy constraints, information, awareness, and technological constraints, and
    financial constraints.
  11: Constraints and limits for adaptation to increased frequency and intensity of
    extreme heat; constraints and limits for adaptation to precipitation variability
    and drought; Ocean temperatures and acidification and loss of arctic sea ice;
    Sea level rise
Highlights:
  3: Constraints and limits to adaptation are critical to understanding the extent
    to which human and natural systems can successfully adapt to climate change. Most
    literature identifies constraints to adaptation, but there is limited literature
    focused on limits to adaptation. Finance, governance, institutional, and policy
    constraints are most prevalent globally.
  10: Small Islands emerge as a specific region where soft limits may arise and be
    more difficult to overcome given the high number of identified constraints. Ecosystem-based,
    technological, and infrastructural responses face constraints that may lead to
    limits.
Methodology:
  3: Systematic review of 1,682 academic studies on human adaptation responses to
    identify patterns in constraints and limits to adaptation for different regions,
    sectors, hazards, adaptation response types, and actors.
  10: The study uses chi-square tests of independence (Bonferroni-corrected) to indicate
    relationships between articles.
  11: Bonferroni-corrected chi-square tests; analysis of articles on adaptation constraints
    and limits
More Notes:
  3: The study uses IPCC definitions of constraints and limits to adaptation.
  11: The radar chart displays the percentage of articles mentioning each sector (e.g.,
    terrestrial & freshwater ecosystems, ocean & coastal ecosystems, water, food,
    fiber & other ecosystem products, cities, settlements, and key infrastructure,
    health, wellbeing & communities, poverty, livelihoods & sustainable development)
    over the total number of articles. Two lines represent the percentage of papers
    only identifying constraints and the percentage of papers linking constraints
    to limits.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: No relevant information
  10: Adaptation constraints and limits may have widespread effects affecting a range
    of sectors; Food, fiber, and other ecosystem products and poverty and livelihoods
    and sustainable development emerge as sectors with the largest share of papers
    on constraints and limits.

  10: Africa (552 adaptation papers, 423 with constraints/limits); Asia (592, 462);
    Australasia (77, 45); Central & South America (102, 76); Europe (189, 117); North
    America (225, 167); Small Islands (80, 63). 81% of papers identify more than one
    constraint. Small Islands have the largest percentage of papers with four or more
    constraints (32%), while Europe leads in papers acknowledging only one constraint
    (43%).
