Drivers of Risk:
  2: Rising atmospheric CO2, affecting plant growth and microbial decomposition, and
    thus soil C input and turnover.
Highlights:
  2: The increase in soil C turnover with rising CO2 leads to lower equilibrium soil
    C stocks than expected from the rise in soil C input alone, indicating that it
    is a general mechanism limiting C accumulation in soil.
Methodology:
  2: Combining meta-analysis with data assimilation using a one-pool biogeochemical
    model constrained by multiple independent data streams from 53 CO2 enrichment
    experiments.
More Notes:
  2: "The study uses a one-pool model, and also a two-pool model, of soil C cycling.\
    \ Equation 1: Ct = C0[exp(\u2013kt)] + I/k[1 \u2212 exp(\u2013kt)] is used to\
    \ model soil C content, decomposition rate, and annual carbon input."
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Soil C stocks
Quantitative material:
  2: Atmospheric CO2 enrichment stimulates both the input (+19.8%) and the turnover
    of C in soil (+16.5%). Cropland soil C input increases 10.9%, grassland 20.1%
    and forest 23.3% with CO2 enrichment.
