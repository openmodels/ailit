Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, specifically changes in temperature in origin and destination
    countries impacting tourist preferences.
  8: Climate change (temperature, precipitation), changes in tourist climate preferences.
  9: Climate change (temperature, precipitation), GDP per capita, population.
  10: Changes in tourist arrivals caused by changes in temperature.
  11: Change in temperatures and GDPpc (GDP per capita)
  12: Climate change (specifically changes in climate variables) and GDP per capita
    growth.
  13: Climate change is a driver of risk, specifically impacting tourism flows.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change implies a greater loss of attractiveness for traditional warm
    destinations and would increase attractiveness for high latitude countries.
  8: There exists a turning point temperature in both destination and origin countries
    that influences tourist flows. These turning points have changed over time, potentially
    due to warming or shifting climate preferences.
  9: Climate change is expected to lead to a gradual shift of tourist destinations
    towards higher latitudes. Colder countries like Canada or Russia would become
    more attractive, while warmer countries from the Southern Hemisphere, like the
    United States and Mediterranean countries, would be the losers.
  10: Current warmer traditional tourist destinations may experience changes in international
    tourist arrivals due to temperature changes.
  11: Countries located in lower latitudes may experience a decrease in tourist arrivals,
    potentially being replaced by countries in higher latitudes such as China, Russia,
    and Canada.
  12: Global warming is generally negative for warm destinations in terms of competitiveness
    in attracting international tourism. Climate change can cause a loss of attractiveness
    for traditional winter resorts and warmer destinations, while increasing attractiveness
    for high-latitude countries.
  13: The projection of international tourism demand is made through constant elasticities,
    ignoring possible saturation, which might be plausible regarding income elasticity.
Methodology:
  1: A demand model for international tourism is estimated, including classic determinants
    and allowing a time-varying climatic sensitivity of tourists, using data from
    178 countries for 1995-2010. Scenarios A2, B1 and B2 are used to project the impact
    on international tourism flows.
  8: Regression analysis (Eq. 1, Eq. 3, Eq. 4) using tourism data from 1995-2010.
  9: Simulation using IPCC climate change scenarios (A2, B1, B2) to project tourism
    flows based on GDP, population, temperature, and precipitation. Baseline year
    is 2007. The estimates presented in Table 1 are used to generate predicted tourist
    arrivals for 2007.
  11: Compares tourist arrivals in 2080 to those in 2007 under climate change scenarios
    A2, B1, and B2.
  12: An econometric model that extrapolates estimates for A2, B1, and B2 climate
    scenarios based on a database and estimation method not fully described in this
    page.
  13: The paper uses a model operating on a national scale with annual data, projecting
    international tourism demand through constant elasticities. Sensitivity analyses
    are performed on the parameters.
More Notes:
  8: The paper suggests that colder countries are becoming more attractive tourist
    destinations, and warmer origin countries are seeing more international departures.
  9: Economic growth moderates the negative impact of climate change on tourism, although
    the distribution of gains and losses still favors colder countries.
  11: The study suggests a shift in the 'gravity' of tourism towards higher latitudes
    due to climate change.
  12: The analysis suggests a non-linear (inverted u-shape) relationship between temperature
    at the destination and tourism demand, indicating an optimal climatic condition
    for tourism. A u-shape relationship between temperature in the origin country
    and tourism demand is also found.
  13: The model doesn't consider domestic tourism or changes in preferences, age structure,
    working hours, and life styles that could affect tourist behavior. The paper acknowledges
    limitations related to spatial-temporal scales due to reliance on national-level,
    annual tourism data, consistent with UN-WTO recommendations.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Loss of competitiveness for traditional warm destinations and increased attractiveness
    for high latitude countries due to climate change.
  8: Tourist arrivals/departures, competitiveness of tourist destinations.
  9: Tourism flows/tourist arrivals are used as a proxy for economic impact, with
    increases in tourism considered beneficial and decreases detrimental.
  11: Percentage variation in tourist arrivals
  12: Distributional effect of climate change on international tourism arrivals in
    top tourist countries.
  13: The paper focuses on international tourism demand and its sensitivity to climate
    change at a national level.
Quantitative material:
  1: Data for the projected growth of Gross Domestic Product per capita and climatic
    conditions within A2, B1 and B2 scenarios are used to assess the impact on international
    tourism flows.
  8: "Optimal destination temperature for international tourists is 15.7 \xBAC. Optimal\
    \ origin temperature for not travelling abroad is 14.7 \xBAC on average."
  9: Projections for tourist arrivals in 2007 and 2080 under different climate change
    scenarios (A2, B1, B2).
  10: Percentage change in tourist arrivals for 2080 compared to 2007 under different
    climate scenarios.
  11: Percentage change in tourist arrivals for 2080, compared to arrivals in 2007,
    under scenarios A2, B1, and B2. Maps show regional variations using a color gradient
    from >300% to -25% to 0%.
  12: Projected percentage change in international tourism arrivals in 2080 under
    climate scenarios A2, B1, and B2, both with and without GDP per capita growth
    considerations, for various countries.
