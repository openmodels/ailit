Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes to the stages and other characteristics of severe drought occurrence,
    particularly longer persistence stages, driven by climate change as projected
    by global climate models.
  2: Projected future changes to Canadian Prairie droughts based on climate models;
    Increased drying in summer and annual scales, particularly at the end of the century
    under higher emission scenarios.
  6: Droughts, including growth, persistence, and retreat stages, as well as severity
    and intensity.
  10: Increased frequency and persistence of severe droughts due to climate change,
    particularly under higher emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5).
  11: The primary driver of risk explored on this page is the changing characteristics
    of severe droughts, specifically their growth, persistence, retreat, duration,
    severity, and intensity, influenced by different Representative Concentration
    Pathways (RCPs) of climate change.
  12: Increased persistence of severe droughts, particularly during the growing season
    (May to August).
  14: Increased frequency, persistence, severity, and intensity of large-area severe
    droughts associated with warming and reduced summer precipitation are expected
    to impact economic sectors.
Highlights:
  1: Future severe drought conditions are projected to increase in duration and intensity,
    mainly due to longer persistence stages.
  2: More persistent droughts are projected for the southern Canadian Prairies, particularly
    after 2040, with multi-year droughts becoming more probable. Southern watersheds
    are projected to experience a gradual increase in annual water deficit throughout
    the 21st century. Drying tendency expected to accelerate mid-century.
  6: The 1930s were a severe drought decade. The 1917-1920 drought had the longest
    duration and third-highest severity, making it the most intense. The most extreme
    SPEI values were located in central Alberta and west-central Saskatchewan.
  10: Frequency and duration (persistence) of severe droughts are projected to increase,
    especially in the far future under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Longer droughts
    consume adaptive resources and inflict more damage, particularly those exceeding
    two years.
  11: Modelled historical data underestimates drought duration compared to observations.
    Near future drought durations are projected to be similar to historical observed
    droughts. Far future drought characteristics are significantly impacted by future
    emissions scenarios (RCPs).
  12: Severe droughts are projected to be longer in the future due to greater persistence.
    Drought intensity is more scenario-dependent in the far future, with higher intensity
    under RCP8.5. The average of GCMs underestimates the percentage of severe droughts
    peaking during the growing season in the historical period compared to observed
    data (CANGRD).
  14: Severe drought occurrences expected to double by the end of the century under
    RCP 8.5, with increased duration and persistence contributing to increased severity.
Methodology:
  1: The study assesses historical and projected future changes to the stages and
    other characteristics of severe drought occurrence across the agricultural region
    of the Canadian Prairies using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration
    Index and 29 global climate models (GCMs) with three representative concentration
    pathways.
  2: Analysis is based on Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and Standardized Precipitation
    Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) projections from global climate models (GCMs)
    under various emission scenarios (A2, A1B, B2, RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5) for
    the periods 2011-2100 and 2041-2070/2071-2100 (relative to 1971-2000). Uses 29
    GCMs participating in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase Five (CMIP5).
  6: "Analysis based on the percentage of grid cells in severe drought or worse (SPEI\
    \ < -1.5) during the 12-month agricultural year (September to August) for the\
    \ period 1900\u20132014. Drought growth, persistence and retreat are considered.\
    \ Drought severity is measured by the SPEI values."
  10: Analysis based on 29 global climate models (GCMs) under different Representative
    Concentration Pathways (RCPs) comparing historical (1900-2005), near future (2021-2060)
    and far future (2061-2100) drought patterns. Uses Canadian Gridded Dataset (CANGRD)
    for observed drought data.
  11: "The analysis uses 29 Global Climate Models (GCMs) to model drought characteristics\
    \ under historical (1900\u20132005), near future (2021\u20132060), and far future\
    \ (2061\u20132100) periods, considering RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. Severe droughts\
    \ were identified from 1900\u20132014 using CANGRD data for comparison."
  12: Analysis of 29 GCM projections of drought severity and intensity using the Standardized
    Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The results are applicable for
    the Prairie region of Canada, specifically examining historical (1900-2005), near
    future (2021-2060), and far future (2061-2100) periods under different Representative
    Concentration Pathways (RCPs).
  14: Analysis based on projections from 29 CMIP5 GCMs using RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and
    RCP 8.5 emission scenarios, examining past and projected drought characteristics.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the characteristics of drought itself (stages, duration,
    intensity) and identifies some economic effects of drought, but does not quantify
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  2: There are considerable differences among individual climate model projections.
    The study area focuses on the agricultural region of the Canadian Prairies, encompassing
    parts of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.
  10: The retreat stage of droughts is underestimated in historical model projections.
  11: The page provides valuable insights into the projected changes in drought characteristics
    under different climate scenarios, however, it does not directly quantify the
    macroeconomic or fiscal impacts of these changes. Further analysis would be needed
    to translate these drought characteristics into economic costs and benefits.
  12: The spatial extent and pattern of severe drought changes are analyzed, with
    increased severity projected mostly over northern to central Alberta and southeastern
    Saskatchewan, and southwestern Manitoba. The historical ensemble underestimates
    drought intensity compared to actual observed intensity.
  14: The study emphasizes the critical need for understanding anticipated drought
    changes for future management of impacts.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Decreased agricultural production and hydro-electric power generation and increased
    freshwater transportation costs are mentioned as economic effects of drought.
  2: The economic dependence of the Canadian Prairies on agriculture makes the region
    susceptible to drought impacts.
  6: Longer drought events tend to cause greater losses as storage of water and other
    adaptive resources are depleted.
  10: Implies GDP and productivity losses through statements about consumption of
    adaptive resources and infliction of damage from longer droughts, and impacts
    to growing seasons.
  11: This page focuses on drought characteristics rather than direct macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes, but severe droughts can be considered a *driver* of macroeconomic
    risk, impacting GDP, productivity, and potentially requiring increased public
    expenditure for disaster relief and adaptation measures.
  12: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: No specific quantitative information on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes is provided
    on this page.
  6: Ten severe droughts exceeding the 45% threshold of grid cells in severe drought
    were identified between 1900 and 2014. Median drought duration is 19.5 months,
    ranging from 15 to 32 months. Median retreat stage is five months. Drought severities
    ranged from -0.89 to -1.47, with a median of -1.36 (SPEI values).
  10: Projects an average increase in drought persistence of around eight months in
    the worst-case scenario (RCP 8.5 far future).
  11: The box plots provide quantitative information on drought characteristics. For
    example, the modelled historical median underestimates severe drought duration
    by nearly six months (14 versus 19.5 months) compared to CANGRD data. Near future
    projections range from 18 to 21 months, closely matching CANGRD values.
  12: Percentage of severe droughts peaking during the growing season for historical,
    near future (2021-2060), and far future (2061-2100) periods under RCP 2.6, 4.5,
    and 8.5 scenarios; Median severity (SPEI value) and intensity of severe Prairie
    droughts for historical, near future, and far future periods under RCP 2.6, 4.5,
    and 8.5 scenarios.
