Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Uncertainties in predicting the behavior of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets\
    \ due to limitations in ice sheet models and understanding of ice dynamic effects;\
    \ temperature scenarios (+2\xB0C and +5\xB0C)."
  2: "Temperature change scenarios (2\xB0C and 5\xB0C warming relative to pre-industrial\
    \ levels)."
  3: Sea-level rise (SLR) contributions from Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), West Antarctic
    Ice Sheet (WAIS), and East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) under different temperature
    scenarios (Low/L and High/H).
Highlights:
  1: Expert uncertainty in SLR projections has grown since the AR5, particularly due
    to uncertain ice dynamic effects. The findings support the use of scenarios of
    21st-century global total SLR exceeding 2 m for planning purposes. Beyond 2100,
    uncertainty and projected SLR increase rapidly.
  2: The experts' joint view is that large amplitude, nonlinear instabilities could
    be triggered at the higher temperature scenario, even by 2050, leading to an extended
    upper tail in the probability density functions (PDFs) for sea level rise contributions.
  3: The contribution of the GrIS to total SLR declines statistically relative to
    AIS with higher mean estimates, and the EAIS exhibits a long tail in its probability
    distribution. At lower total SLR values, linear processes dominate, while highly
    nonlinear dynamic processes are crucial for marine sectors of the AIS to achieve
    higher total SLR values.
Methodology:
  1: "Structured expert judgment (SEJ) study using unique techniques for modeling\
    \ correlations between inter- and intra-ice sheet processes and their tail dependences.\
    \ The analysis considers uncertainties in ice sheet dynamics and uses temperature\
    \ scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement (+2\xB0C) and unchecked emissions\
    \ growth (+5\xB0C)."
  2: Structured expert judgement (SEJ) exercise using calibrated expert responses
    to estimate uncertainties in ice sheet projections. Experts quantified uncertainties
    for accumulation, discharge, and surface runoff for Greenland, West Antarctic,
    and East Antarctic ice sheets under two temperature change scenarios. Dependence
    between processes was also elicited.
  3: Probabilistic projections of ice sheet contributions to sea-level rise are estimated
    under two temperature scenarios (L and H) representing different warming levels
    roughly comparable to RCP2.6/4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. The analysis considers
    dependencies between different ice sheet contributions. Results are cumulative
    from 2000.
More Notes:
  2: The study highlights the importance of accounting for tail dependence in assessing
    sea-level rise risk, as ignoring it may lead to underestimating the probability
    of high SLR contributions.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Estimates of global mean sea-level rise (SLR) and its impact on coastal communities
    and ecosystems.
  2: Sea level rise (SLR) contributions from ice sheets.
  3: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: "For a +2\xB0C temperature scenario, the median SLR contribution by 2100 is 26\
    \ cm, with a 95th percentile of 81 cm. For a +5\xB0C scenario, the corresponding\
    \ values are 51 cm and 178 cm. Inclusion of thermal expansion and glacier contributions\
    \ results in a global total SLR estimate exceeding 2 m at the 95th percentile.\
    \ The 95th percentile ice sheet contribution by 2200, for the +5\xB0C scenario,\
    \ is 7.5 m."
  2: "For 2050, median ice sheet contributions are projected at 10 cm (5-18 cm) for\
    \ the 2\xB0C scenario and 12 cm (6-24 cm) for the 5\xB0C scenario. By 2100, projected\
    \ contributions are 26 cm (12-53 cm) and 51 cm (22-113 cm) for the 2\xB0C and\
    \ 5\xB0C scenarios, respectively."
  3: Projected SLR contributions (cm) from GrIS, WAIS, EAIS for 2050, 2100, 2200,
    2300 under Low and High temperature scenarios; includes mean, standard deviation,
    median, 5-95% credible interval, and 17-83% likely range.
