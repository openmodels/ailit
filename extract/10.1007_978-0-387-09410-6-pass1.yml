Highlights:
  5: A statistical model of Atlantic hurricanes indicates a recent upswing in the
    number of strongest hurricanes with little or no multidecadal variation; smoothing
    hurricane count data introduces low frequency patterns that may not be significant.
  54: Coral rubble ridges are formed by successive cyclones and can be used to estimate
    the frequency of cyclone events over long periods. Sheltered sides of islands
    are more likely to preserve ridges due to reduced wave energy.
  64: Ridge and terrace records in Queensland can be used to reconstruct the intensity
    of past tropical cyclone events. The height of landforms represents the minimum
    height of storm inundation.
  65: The table presents calculated central pressure of tropical cyclones responsible
    for emplacing ridges and eroding terraces at specific locations.
  69: "Intense cyclones correlate with peaks in the isotope depletion curve. Isotope\
    \ depletion levels are related to cyclone intensity and proximity, with R2 = 0.6,\
    \ p < 0.001. A value of /C0 2.50 \u2030 represents critical value for moderate\
    \ to severe hazard impact at-a-station."
  72: Extreme tropical cyclones occur in the Cairns region considerably more frequently
    than previously estimated from the short instrumental record; Incorporating Quaternary
    data will lead to a more realistic assessment of tropical cyclone magnitude and
    frequency relationship and a reduction in risk as a consequence.
  75: The paper suggests that relatively small changes in the sun's output can significantly
    alter the climate due to the amplification effect of tropical cyclones.
  88: The paper focuses on developing five-year hurricane number prediction schemes
    by estimating the current climate state, and modeling future climate changes.
  90: The study focuses on predicting the number of hurricanes that make U.S. landfall,
    using data from 1950 onwards.
  93: Change-points in hurricane numbers are more easily detectable in basin data
    compared to landfall data due to the reduction in sample size (number of storms)
    when considering only landfalling hurricanes. This suggests that statistical noise
    can obscure trends in landfall data even if trends exist in the overall number
    of hurricanes.
  95: Change-point analyses all identify the same point in time for the most recent
    change-point (1994/1995), leading to the same short baseline prediction.
  105: Indirect methods to forecast hurricane numbers have less error than direct
    methods. Historically (since the 60s) all models tested produce more accurate
    forecasts than the long term baseline.
  106: Models based on sea surface temperature (SST) predictions have significantly
    lower error than the long-term mean for predicting Category 3-5 hurricanes.
  108: Specific predictions on the number of Category 1-5 and Category 3-5 hurricanes
    making landfall in the U.S. using different SST prediction models for years 2006-2010.
  144: The probability of a storm becoming a strong hurricane depends on its genesis
    location and whether the year is warm or cold.
  160: The paper shows that modifications to trend and correlation analysis between
    Sea Surface Temperature Changes (SSTC) and Tropical Cyclones (TC) do not affect
    the main results.
  165: Certain regions like Louisiana have high hurricane occurrence rates but not
    necessarily high connectivity. Southwest Florida, northwest Florida, and North
    Carolina have the highest connectivity. Virginia, with a low occurrence rate,
    is centrally located in the network with high betweenness. Significant differences
    in network connectivity are noted between phases of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.
  166: Network analysis offers a more direct and systematic way to look at the correlated
    risk of hurricanes than previous studies.
  169: The Gulf and Southeast coasts from Texas to North Carolina are most frequently
    affected by hurricanes, with Louisiana, northwest Florida, and North Carolina
    experiencing the most frequent hurricanes within this zone. The northeast coast
    of Florida experiences the fewest hurricanes, while the northwest coast experiences
    the most. The rate of hurricanes affecting Louisiana is relatively constant over
    time, while the rate affecting southeast Florida is variable.
  172: Highlights linkages between regions affected by hurricanes, particularly the
    high number of links between northeastern Florida and New England due to traveling
    hurricanes.
  174: Southwest Florida and North Carolina have large node degrees.
  192: Spatial/temporal shifts in major hurricane landfall intervals result from the
    migration of the zone of maximum TC frequency.
  217: Impact of continental aerosol on hurricane cloud structure and lightning rate
    investigated.
  219: "Aerosols affect cloud structure, intensity, and spatial distribution of precipitation\
    \ of TCs approaching and penetrating the land; Precipitation in the TC zone of\
    \ 350\u2013400 km radius decreases in dirty air due to weakening of convection\
    \ in the central zone; Decrease in TC intensity under the influence of small aerosols\
    \ allows consideration of hurricane intensity decrease by seeding of small aerosols\
    \ near cloud base at TC periphery"
  225: The paper explores the potential of the Convective Yearly Genesis Parameter
    (CYGP) for analyzing tropical cyclone genesis in climate simulations by applying
    it to past climate and A2 scenario future climate simulations.
  236: The spatial distribution of the change in TC genesis is shown across different
    climate models, with positive changes indicated by solid lines and negative changes
    by dashed lines.
  245: This study finds the possibility of tropical cyclone development over the Mediterranean
    due to climate change, with a large model spread predicting anything from no change
    to the formation of strong tropical cyclones.
  252: No trend observed in the number of most intense cyclones when considering an
    aggregate of five models. A visual inspection reveals no correlation between the
    number of intense cyclones and SST. One model (REMO) showed a relationship between
    higher SST areas and intensity increase, and the three most intense cyclones occurred
    during the last decade of the simulation for that model.
  264: The proposed method aims to achieve high speed detection of tropical cyclone
    centers without relying on empirical conditions, addressing limitations of conventional
    methods when applied to high-resolution numerical models.
  268: No relevant information
  296: General reduction of tropical cyclone frequency with increased CO2 concentration,
    particularly in the tropical North West Pacific and North Atlantic. Weaker TC
    activity in NWP seems associated with reduced convective instabilities. Weaker
    TC activity in the ATL region seems due to both the increased stability of the
    atmosphere and a stronger vertical wind shear. Evidence of increased rainfall
    associated with the simulated cyclones despite overall warming of the tropical
    upper ocean.
  300: The paper explores the effects of greenhouse global warming on simulated tropical
    cyclones using idealized experiments involving doubling and quadrupling of atmospheric
    CO2.
  304: The climate model underestimates the total number of tropical cyclones per
    year compared to observations.
  310: Model indicates intense convective disturbances similar to observed tropical
    cyclones, suggesting suitability for climate change impact investigation on tropical
    cyclone activity.
  311: The spatial features of SST and precipitation changes are similar for 2CO2-PREIND
    and 4CO2-PREIND, but the amplitudes differ.
  343: The frequency of model TCs is related to vertical wind shear induced by SST
    anomalies in the eastern equatorial Pacific; Upward trend in model TC frequency
    seems related to SST warming in the North Atlantic.
  347: The trend in damages from hurricanes highlights the importance of and need
    for better TC track and intensity forecasting.
  368: Total losses increase non-linearly, amplifying the role of the most extreme
    events.
  371: The paper's main aim is to demonstrate a methodology for estimating climate
    change damages, rather than providing new estimates of aggregate climate change
    damages.
  372: Downscaling is crucial for localized impacts where local characteristics and
    weather variability play a significant role, like in mountain areas or cities.
  374: Climate change increases the annual probability of hurricane landfall, especially
    for intense hurricanes. The risk of large-scale disaster from category 5 hurricanes
    could significantly increase. Some regions, like New Orleans, face a disproportionately
    higher risk.
  377: Method provides an assessment of local vulnerability parameters.
  378: A 10% increase in potential hurricane intensity significantly increases both
    the average annual hurricane losses and the probability of extreme hurricane events
    (losses exceeding $10 billion and $50 billion).
  379: Adaptation measures like building codes, protection infrastructure, and warning
    systems can significantly reduce hurricane damages.
  380: Uncertainty about future climate is a strong obstacle to the implementation
    of adaptation measures because costs of adaptation are immediate but benefits
    are uncertain and delayed.
  382: The Economic Amplification Ratio (EAR) increases dramatically for large-scale
    disasters due to propagation effects and production losses during reconstruction;
    indirect losses must be estimated for fair cost-benefit analyses; propagation
    effects between sectors and reconstruction duration are important indirect effects.
  383: Hurricane Katrina caused an 8% instantaneous reduction in Louisiana's economic
    production, and the model predicts a reconstruction period of approximately 10
    years.
  384: Hurricane Katrina caused a 2.8% production loss in Louisiana in the last four
    months of 2005, underestimating the observed growth loss of 4.5%.
  385: Hurricane Katrina resulted in significant production losses ($47 billion) and
    total losses ($154 billion) in Louisiana, with an economic amplification ratio
    of 1.44, meaning indirect economic effects were significant relative to direct
    damage.
  386: Total losses increase nonlinearly with direct losses; when direct losses exceed
    US$40 billion, the economic system's ability to dampen the shock is reduced; The
    Economic Amplification Ratio (EAR) increases with the size of the disaster.
  387: Taking into account indirect effects leads to a reduction in the mean annual
    economic losses due to hurricanes in the present climate.
  388: A resilient economy is able to cope with disasters in an efficient manner;
    reconstruction must be done as fast as possible to restore production and housing;
    increasing the number of specialists (e.g., glaziers, roofers) can significantly
    reduce reconstruction duration.
  389: Disasters can be opportunities for improving productivity through the adoption
    of new technologies during reconstruction.
  390: Decision-makers should not ignore the economic costs of extreme events in designing
    responses to climate change, including indirect costs in cost estimates.
  399: "Scientists are ninety percent certain that human activities are the cause\
    \ of the conspicuous increase in the warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere."
Methodology:
  5: Statistical modeling is superior to data analysis (trend lines, etc.) for studying
    hurricanes; Poisson distribution is useful for modeling tropical storm counts
    over time.
  54: Radiocarbon dating of coral rubble ridges to determine the timing of past cyclone
    events.
  64: Analysis involves radiocarbon dating of coral/shell or OSL dating of sands from
    ridge and terrace deposits to determine minimum inundation heights. Inundation
    height is related to paleocyclone intensity. The elevation of ridges and terraces
    is surveyed.
  65: Numerical storm surge and shallow water wave models are used to determine the
    relationship between surge height and central pressure for locations with paleocyclone
    evidence. Models also relate surge height to cyclone translational velocity, radius
    of maximum winds, and track angle. Model results are compared to measured surge
    heights.
  69: Isotope analysis of rainfall and soil water to reconstruct cyclone history.
    Multiple regression analysis used to relate isotope depletion to cyclone intensity
    and distance. Analysis spans AD 1228 to 2003.
  72: Paleo-environmental studies (e.g., analysis of stalagmites) to reconstruct long-term
    time series of tropical cyclone events.
  88: The analysis uses historical data, weighting recent data more heavily, to estimate
    the current climate state and models potential future changes. It incorporates
    methods that assume no change from the current state, trend extrapolation, and
    estimation of future climate shifts. The models incorporate past effects of trends
    and variability. Simple classical statistical methods are used, with some model
    shrinkage.
  90: Uses hurricane data from 1950 onwards to build relationships between SSTs, hurricane
    numbers in the Atlantic basin, and hurricane landfalls. Data prior to 1900 is
    not used, and data between 1900 and 1950 is only used for landfall numbers.
  93: Change-point analysis is used to identify shifts in hurricane numbers over time.
    Statistical analysis is used to determine the probability of detecting change-points
    in basin data versus landfall data.
  95: A 'short baseline' method is used to predict the number of landfalling hurricanes,
    based on change-points identified in the basin hurricane number time-series. This
    method averages the number of landfalling hurricanes since the most recent basin
    change-point (1994/1995). A 'long baseline' method is also mentioned, but argued
    to be biased due to non-stationarity in the series. The probability of storms
    making landfall is modeled as constant.
  106: Presents a set of models to predict the number of US landfalling hurricanes
    likely to occur in the next five years based on various assumptions and methods.
    The models are hindcast from 1960-1964 to 2003-2007.
  108: Various models used for predicting hurricane landfall numbers based on SST
    predictions with different assumptions and statistical links.
  144: The probability patterns for genesis locations of storms becoming strong hurricanes
    are plotted for all years (1948-2006), warm years, and cold years. Genesis locations
    are shown, with those becoming strong hurricanes marked with squares containing
    a center dot. The shading indicates the percentage of storms forming in that region
    that became strong hurricanes.
  160: "Time series analysis and statistical testing, specifically wavelet coherence\
    \ analysis. The analysis examines the relationship between Tropical Cyclone (TC)\
    \ occurrences and Eurasian autumn snow cover from 1930 to 2000, investigating\
    \ the time lag (\u0394) and period (\u03BB) of coherence between these variables.\
    \ Plots visualize the coherence using grayscale shading and contour lines to identify\
    \ regions of significant correlation."
  165: Network analysis is used to study hurricane climatology, linking coastal locations
    (nodes) with particular hurricanes (links).
  166: Network analysis is used to examine hurricane landfalls in a relational way,
    focusing on the correlated risk of hurricanes in US coastal regions. The analysis
    involves constructing an adjacency matrix from an incidence matrix to create a
    network of landfalls. Local and global network metrics are computed, and their
    relationship with climate covariates is examined.
  169: Network analysis is used to study the relationship between regions affected
    by the same hurricane. Analysis is based on historical hurricane data and considers
    frequency, cumulative sums, and co-occurrence of hurricanes in different regions.
  172: Constructs a U.S. hurricane network based on hurricane incidence data from
    1851-2005 using incidence and adjacency matrices. The network maps linkages between
    regions affected by the same hurricane. Analysis is done using the R language.
  174: Network analysis is used to model the spread of hurricane impacts across regions.
    The measures used include degree, closeness and betweenness, focusing on the concept
    of centrality in the network to measure the number of links between regions.
  192: Hindcasting paleopositions of the Bermuda High (BH) and TC zone based on ITCZ
    position using the Cariaco record. Correlation of low-frequency ITCZ and BH movements
    is suggested.
  217: Used 2D cloud model with spectral bin microphysics and 3D WRF model with bulk
    microphysics.
  219: Numerical simulation; 2-D cloud model; WRF mesoscale model
  225: "The CYGP replaces the thermal contributions of Gray\u2019s YGP with convective\
    \ precipitation, integrating atmospheric stability, low-level humidity, and sea\
    \ surface temperature (SST) anomalies. This new formulation avoids the dependence\
    \ on a fixed SST threshold."
  236: "The model CYGP (change in tropical cyclone genesis potential) change is analyzed\
    \ at the end of the 21st century (2070\u20132099) with respect to the end of the\
    \ 20th century (1970\u20131999) using various climate models."
  245: Analysis is performed using an ensemble of regional climate models nested in
    a global climate model and the cyclone phase space method to detect tropical characteristics.
  247: The study uses regional climate model simulations with a horizontal resolution
    of 50-55 km to analyze potential tropical cyclone development in the Mediterranean
    during September. It compares a control run (1960-1990) with observed greenhouse
    gas levels to a scenario run (2070-2100) considering SRES-A2 emissions. Cyclone
    detection is based on an objective method using sea level pressure (SLP) fields.
  252: Uses SCEN simulation, cyclone phase space method (Hart, 2003) with 3 parameters
    related to thermal symmetry and warm/cold core analysis in the troposphere. Analyzes
    the 10 most intense cyclones from five models and aggregates their frequency.
    Considers SST evolution and correlation with cyclone frequency. The analysis covers
    the period 2071-2100.
  264: Proposes a new method for tropical cyclone detection using coordinate transformation
    and streamline curvature, aiming for high speed detection without empirical conditions,
    using NCEP reanalysis dataset for velocity fields. It transforms latitude-longitude
    coordinates to 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates.
  268: No relevant information
  296: Analysis of scenario climate simulations using a fully coupled high-resolution
    global general circulation model, compared with 20th-century simulations and observations.
  300: Climate scenario simulations using the SINTEX model (SXG), which includes a
    sea-ice model. The model simulates TC-like vortices under different CO2 concentrations
    (PREIND, 2CO2, 4CO2) and compares these simulations. The 20C3M experiment uses
    historical data from 1970-1999. The CO2 concentration in the 2CO2 and 4CO2 scenarios
    is increased by 1%/year until the target concentrations are reached, and then
    the model is run for 100 years at those constant levels.
  304: "The paper analyzes the ability of a climate model to simulate tropical cyclone-like\
    \ vortices (TCs) using a methodology discussed in Section 2.4. The analysis compares\
    \ the total number of TCs per year detected in the model simulation and in observations\
    \ over the period 1970\u20131999."
  310: Climate scenario experiments using models (PREIND, 2CO2, 4CO2) to investigate
    impacts of increased atmospheric CO2 on tropical climate.
  311: The study compares the seasonal mean SST and precipitation in experiments with
    doubled (2CO2) and quadrupled (4CO2) CO2 concentrations to a pre-industrial (PREIND)
    control.
  343: Analysis using 71-yr outputs simulated in a high-resolution (T213) coupled
    ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (CGCM).
  368: Uses the Emanuel hurricane model to estimate present and future local landfall
    probabilities; statistical analysis of historical landfalls to translate probability
    changes into direct economic losses; a modified Input-Output model to investigate
    indirect losses due to macroeconomic mechanisms and feedbacks.
  371: The paper develops a methodology to estimate climate change damages. It follows
    the causal chain from global climate change to economic damages. This involves
    downscaling global climate change simulations and translating changes in hurricane
    risk into changes in direct losses and then into indirect economic impacts, considering
    macroeconomic feedbacks and reconstruction capacity.
  372: 'The paper discusses two approaches to impact assessment: (1) socio-economic
    downscaling to develop local scenarios based on predicted social and economic
    trends, and (2) assessing the impact of future climate on current societies and
    economies. It also discusses downscaling climate change data from Global Climate
    Models (GCMs) to a spatial scale suitable for impact analysis.'
  374: "Uses synthetic hurricane tracks (Modi\uFB01ed Climate or MC) generated from\
    \ Emanuel's model, validated against historical data (HURDAT), to assess the impact\
    \ of increased potential hurricane intensity on landfall probabilities along the\
    \ U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coastline. The model is able to reproduce historical\
    \ probabilities well for category 2-5 hurricanes but less so for category 1."
  376: 'Two methods are described: physical models (developed by consulting companies
    advising the insurance industry) and statistical models (using past hurricanes
    and resulting direct economic losses to create statistical relationships).'
  377: Estimate county vulnerability based on historical hurricane data and a formula
    linking losses to wind speed and a vulnerability parameter, then estimate mean
    direct losses due to synthetic hurricanes.
  378: Uses a hurricane model to simulate hurricane tracks and estimate direct losses
    based on historical data and modified climate assumptions. Values are considered
    similar to historical losses.
  379: The analysis uses normalized losses that remove the influence of inflation,
    population, and wealth to estimate future losses.
  382: Uses the Economic Amplification Ratio (EAR) to measure the ratio between the
    overall economic cost and the direct loss due to a disaster. Suggests using a
    model to assess a fraction of indirect losses. Mentions Input-Output (IO) models
    to assess how a shock propagates into the economy through intermediate consumption
    and demand.
  383: Adaptive Regional Input-Output (ARIO) model, a modified IO model based on IO
    tables and a hybrid modelling methodology. Dynamic model that accounts for changes
    in production capacity due to capital losses and adaptive behavior.
  384: Model-based analysis examining the evolution of production of each sector over
    time; Model does not reproduce the New Orleans disorganization due to lifeline
    interruptions, bankruptcy and supply-chain issues; Model does not account for
    political and practical issues linked to reconstruction.
  385: The model assesses production loss in various sectors and housing services
    due to damage from the hurricane, incorporating the reconstruction period and
    duration to estimate total losses. The model cannot capture all indirect losses
    and assumes the economy will return to its initial situation.
  386: The analysis uses a model that relates direct losses to total losses based
    on the sectoral structure of Katrina in Louisiana in 2005. The results are applicable
    for disasters with a similar sectoral structure to Katrina.
  387: The analysis assesses how future hurricane risks would impact the present-day
    economy.
  388: Discussion of adaptation options to reduce indirect losses by building a resilient
    economy and speeding up reconstruction.
  389: Presents a methodological roadmap to assess climate change economic impacts,
    including downscaling climate change projections to a spatial scale, translating
    local changes into direct losses, investigating adaptation strategies to limit
    these losses, and investigating economic mechanisms that reduce or amplify direct
    losses (propagation from sectors to sectors, production losses during reconstruction,
    macroeconomic feedback).
  390: The analysis uses modelling exercises to assess changes in landfall probabilities,
    direct losses, and indirect losses, but only one model was used for each component
    of the analysis.

More Notes:
  5: The paper focuses on the science of hurricane climate and doesn't explicitly
    address macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes of adaptation. It emphasizes analyzing
    hurricanes as passive responses to climate forcing.
  54: The study focuses on the physical impacts of cyclones on coastal landscapes
    (coral rubble ridge formation) rather than direct macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes. The information on cyclone frequency derived from ridge dating could
    potentially be used in models to assess future economic risks from cyclones, but
    this is not done within this page of the paper itself.
  64: The study assumes that the height of landforms represents the minimum height
    of storm inundation during past cyclone events.
  65: The study focuses on paleocyclones and their impact on coastal geomorphology,
    using numerical models to reconstruct cyclone characteristics from geological
    evidence. The table provides data on various parameters related to cyclone intensity
    and impact at specific locations in Australia.
  72: Lack of familiarity with reconstructing long-term time series from natural records
    may contribute to underestimation of cyclone risk.
  75: The paper links solar activity to hurricane intensity via the warming of the
    lower stratosphere, which affects the potential energy available for cyclone intensification.
  88: The predictability of ENSO and NAO on one to five year time-scales is limited,
    distinguishing these predictions from seasonal predictions. The paper acknowledges
    potential limitations of RMSE as a metric and suggests exploring probabilistic
    forecasts. Bayesian methods were considered but not implemented due to complexity
    and lack of perceived transparency benefits.
  90: Data accuracy is considered reasonably accurate from 1950 onwards. Landfall
    numbers are considered accurate since 1900, but intensities may be poorly estimated.
    The paper mentions limitations in data accuracy prior to 1950 due to fewer observational
    opportunities.
  105: The page focuses on predicting hurricane numbers, not direct economic or fiscal
    impacts, and so is unlikely to be relevant to your literature review.
  106: The models consider the rate at which hurricanes are generated and hit land,
    initially assuming a stationary random process.
  108: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes discussed.
  144: The X Coord axis is not defined, so no geographic conclusion can be made.
  160: The paper presents wavelet coherence plots assessing the relationship between
    TC and Eurasian autumn snow, exploring whether TC leads snow or vice versa. The
    plots do not directly quantify macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes but examine climate-related
    variables.
  165: The paper is expository, introducing network analysis as a method for understanding
    regional hurricane activity.
  169: The regions used in the study do not have the same area or coastal exposure,
    so generalizations of hurricane frequency should be broad. The analysis also looks
    at the time variation in hurricane frequency and the occurrence of years where
    multiple regions are affected.
  172: The network analysis does not distinguish the time order of hits, and the links
    are undirected.
  174: The page focuses on the network structure of hurricane impacts, rather than
    directly quantifying macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  192: The paper suggests that increased frequency of major hurricane landfalls represents
    extended periods of overall increase in TC activity, once geomorphological and
    sea level changes are controlled for. The analysis focuses on long-term paleoclimate
    data and doesn't directly address specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  219: Suggests monitoring lightning in hurricanes can provide useful information
    about climatic changes of structure, intensity, and precipitation in tropical
    cyclones; Aerosol effect on cloudiness, precipitation, and intensity of TCs may
    be even more pronounced than demonstrated in the study.
  236: The page focuses on changes in TC genesis, which, although relevant for understanding
    climate risks, do not directly translate into quantified macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes on this page.
  247: The analysis focuses on September because SSTs are near their maximum and summer
    subsidence is weakening, creating conditions more favorable for tropical cyclone
    development. The cyclone detection area is smaller than the total domain due to
    the 400km radius around SLP minima that is required for detection.
  252: The study analyzes cyclone characteristics to determine if intensity increases
    are associated with tropical characteristics, using the cyclone phase space method.
    The analysis is limited to two models due to data availability. The model with
    the strongest intensity increase (REMO) and the model with the weakest intensity
    increase (PROMES) were analyzed using the cyclone phase space method.
  256: This page primarily discusses climate modeling and the uncertainty surrounding
    tropical cyclone development in the Mediterranean Sea. It focuses on the technical
    aspects of climate model simulations and doesn't directly link these simulations
    to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes at a national level. The graphs appear to
    illustrate the transition from cold-core to warm-core cyclone characteristics
    in simulations, which is useful for climate modeling, but not for quantifying
    adaptation cost-benefit analyses.
  264: The conventional method relies on empirical conditions, is sensitive to grid
    intervals varying with latitude, and is computationally intensive. The proposed
    method seeks to overcome these limitations.
  268: This page is about comparing two streamline methods for tracking atmospheric
    flow. It describes an example using NCEP velocity field data and a tropical cyclone
    named BILIS. It does not contain any information about macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    risks of climate change, or the costs and benefits of adaptation at a national
    level.
  296: An extended version of this work is published in the Journal of Climate (Gualdi
    et al. 2008).
  300: The simulations use a model that includes greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O,
    and CFCs) and sulfate aerosols.
  310: Model simulation shows regional warming patterns in tropical SST and precipitation
    changes due to increased CO2.
  343: The model has a deficiency in simulating TC intensity, suggesting that further
    finer-resolution models are required.
  368: The paper discusses adaptation strategies to limit direct and indirect losses,
    focusing on improving the ability of the economy to reconstruct and deal with
    the consequences of disaster.
  371: The analysis uses socio-economic, emission, and climate scenarios based on
    the IPCC SRES scenarios. A major drawback is that uncertainty is discussed but
    not quantified because only one model is used. The paper focuses on hurricanes
    in the U.S. coastline, acknowledging that this represents only a part of the climate
    change impacts in this region.
  372: The paper acknowledges the difficulty in predicting future socio-economic trends
    and vulnerabilities, especially in developing countries, which can impact the
    accuracy of impact assessments.
  376: The paper disregards fatalities and injuries in its analysis, arguing they
    can be avoided in developed countries with effective warning and evacuation systems.
  377: Losses are assumed to depend on the cubed wind speed, a proxy for energy dissipated
    by the hurricane, considered conservative.
  378: The increased losses may cause an equivalent rise in insurance premiums, potentially
    creating issues of insurance affordability.
  379: Physical models are needed to explicitly account for the impact of adaptation
    measures like changes in building norms.
  382: Discusses the importance of indirect losses that are often overlooked in disaster
    cost assessments. Highlights the propagation effect between sectors, and the reconstruction
    duration and production loss during this period as key indirect effects.  Mentions
    that many models use Input-Output models to assess disaster consequences.
  383: The model assumes the Louisiana economy will eventually return to its pre-storm
    situation and the model results should be considered as indicators of disaster
    seriousness due to the uncertainty involved. The Louisiana economy is divided
    into 15 sectors for the analysis.
  384: The model underestimates the growth loss due to its inability to capture the
    disorganization and political/practical issues following Katrina.
  385: The model doesn't account for all indirect losses (e.g., rationing), assumes
    the economy returns to its initial state (which may not be realistic), and doesn't
    include losses outside the affected region. Political choices impacting the final
    state are not modelled.
  386: The relationship between direct and indirect losses is specific to the state
    of Louisiana in 2005 and the consequences of Katrina. Results would differ for
    other states and different disasters due to variations in production capacity
    and affected sectors.
  387: The present analysis uses a single hurricane model and assumes the non-linearity
    in total losses is valid for all regions and all disasters.
  389: Restoring production quickly is crucial, especially for small businesses; Existing
    capital can constrain the adoption of new technologies.
  390: Uncertainty related to climate change introduces complexity and a cost of uncertainty
    due to needing to design infrastructure to be more resilient to avoid extensive
    retrofitting.
  398: This page focuses on the science and politics of climate change, rather than
    economic outcomes. It does not present an analysis of macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    risks and adaptation costs/benefits.
  399: The paper discusses the link between climate change, global warming, and hurricanes,
    but does not have enough information to determine if anthropogenic climate change
    or natural variability is driving current hurricanes.

    exceeding $10 billion, and 4 exceed $50 billion. With a 10% increase in potential
    intensity, 99 tracks cause losses above $10 billion, and 10 exceed $50 billion.
  379: Elevating 379 houses in Belhaven, Florida after Hurricane Fran led to an 80%
    reduction in damages during Hurricane Floyd., If all buildings in South Florida
    complied with post-Andrew building codes, another Hurricane Andrew would cause
    about half as much damage to residences and 40 percent less damage to commercial
    property, resulting in a $10.4 billion loss reduction.
  382: Introduces the Economic Amplification Ratio (EAR), which measures the ratio
    between the overall economic cost and the direct loss due to a disaster; EAR is
    less than one for small-scale disasters but increases dramatically for large-scale

    loss with reconstruction delays.
  383: Instantaneous production reduction of 8 percent after the shock; reconstruction

  384: Louisiana experienced a loss of 2.8 percent of annual Gross State Product in
    the last four months of 2005; Observed growth loss close to 4.5 percent according
    to BEA data when exogenous growth is removed.
  385: Production loss (sector production plus housing services) estimated at $47
    billion (44% of direct losses); Total losses estimated around $154 billion; Economic
    Amplification Ratio (ratio of total losses to direct losses) equal to 1.44.
  386: Direct losses below US$40b result in negative indirect losses; For Katrina
    (US$100 billion direct losses), EAR = 1.44; For US$200 billion direct losses,
    EAR = 2.00; Indirect losses are estimated using the polynomial regression equation
    y = 0.0057x2 - 0.1968x, where y = indirect losses and x = direct losses.
  387: A 10-percent increase in potential intensity would double the likelihood of
    a hurricane landfall causing more than $50 billion of damages in the U.S.
  388: Reconstruction costs in Florida increased by up to 40 percent in some regions
    after the 2004 hurricane season due to a shortage of roofers.
