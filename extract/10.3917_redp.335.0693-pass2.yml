Drivers of Risk:
  2: Tropical cyclone events
Highlights:
  2: National growth responses to cyclone events are heterogeneous, depending on the
    size and development level of the country; SIDS experience a negative impact on
    economic growth from cyclone exposure.
Methodology:
  2: Panel data regression with time and country fixed effects to study the marginal
    cumulative effect over 15 years after a cyclone strike, using Tropical Cyclone
    Exposure Database (TCE-DAT), Climatic Research Unit gridded Time Series database
    (CRU TS), and United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) data.
More Notes:
  2: Negative impacts in SIDS appear to be driven by an increased dependence on foreign
    economic conditions, insufficient reconstruction capacities, and difficulties
    in implementing adaptation policies.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Per capita GDP growth rate
Quantitative material:
  2: The immediate effect of one additional unit of cyclone exposure is to decrease
    growth rates in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) by -0.016 percentage point,
    dropping to -0.024 percentage point after 15 years.
