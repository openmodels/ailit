Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Increased droughts, fires, and fire emissions of CO2 and PM2.5 in equatorial\
    \ Asia due to anthropogenic warming and El Ni\xF1o events."
  2: No relevant information
  6: "Historical anthropogenic climate change leading to drying (\u25B3P), El Ni\xF1\
    o events, future warming scenarios (1.5\xB0C, 2.0\xB0C, 3.0\xB0C)."
  7: "Changes in climate conditions leading to meteorological drought, drying trends,\
    \ increased fire activities, and severe El Ni\xF1o events."
  16: "Differences in sea surface temperatures between the Ni\xF1o 3.4 region and\
    \ the 30\xBAS-30\xBAN ocean region, as well as different global warming scenarios\
    \ (1.5\xBAC, 2.0\xBAC, 3.0\xBAC)."
  18: "CO2 emissions (specifically from land-use and fire emissions in East and South\
    \ East Asia, excluding China and Japan) exceeding levels consistent with limiting\
    \ global warming to 2.0\xB0C."
Highlights:
  1: "Historical anthropogenic warming increased the chances of meteorological droughts\
    \ exceeding the 2015 observations in equatorial Asia. Achieving the 1.5\xB0C and\
    \ 2.0\xB0C goals still leads to significant increases in burned area and CO2 and\
    \ PM2.5 emissions. Current mitigation policies leading to 3.0\xB0C warming could\
    \ result in a near-certainty of exceeding 2015 fire and emissions levels."
  2: No relevant information
  6: Climate change significantly increases the probability of droughts, burned area,
    and fire emissions of CO2 and PM2.5. Even achieving the Paris Agreement goals
    will substantially increase these risks. Fire CO2 emissions can have substantial
    implications for mitigation policies and integrated assessment models should include
    climate change effects on fire CO2 emissions.
  7: "Historical anthropogenic warming and drying trends have increased the likelihood\
    \ of droughts and fire activities; achieving 2.0\xB0C goal could still increase\
    \ risks of fire emissions; failing to limit warming to 2.0\xB0C could further\
    \ increase risks."
  16: "The relationship between Ni\xF1o 3.4 warming and changes in vertical motion\
    \ and precipitation are analyzed under different global warming scenarios."
  18: "The figure presents cumulative probability of staying below a 2.0\xB0C global\
    \ temperature increase based on CO2 emissions pathways. It shows how different\
    \ CO2 emission scenarios (SSP1, SSP4, SSP2, SSP3 baselines) impact the probability\
    \ of limiting warming to 2.0\xB0C."
Methodology:
  1: "Uses large event attribution ensembles of the MIROC5 atmospheric global climate\
    \ model and future climate simulations with prescribed sea surface temperature\
    \ data having the same spatial patterns as the 2015 El Ni\xF1o with long-term\
    \ warming trends. Combines these experiments with empirical functions among precipitation,\
    \ burned area, and fire emissions of CO2 and PM2.5."
  2: "Uses probabilistic event attribution (PEA) with large ensemble simulations of\
    \ the MIROC5 atmospheric global climate model (AGCM) to evaluate the degree to\
    \ which human influence has affected the probability of a particular event. Examines\
    \ how the probabilities of drought, fire and fire emissions of CO2 and PM2.5 would\
    \ change when major El Ni\xF1o events like 2015 occur under 1.5\xBAC and 2.0\xBA\
    C warmed climates, using large ensembles of the MIROC5 AGCM under the HAPPI project."
  6: "Large ensemble simulations are used to estimate probabilities of drought exceeding\
    \ observed values. Empirical relationships between \u25B3P and burned area/fire\
    \ emissions are used. Uncertainties are assessed by resampling \u25B3P and regression\
    \ factors. Cumulative probability function of fire CO2 emissions is estimated\
    \ using simulated precipitation anomalies and empirical functions."
  7: "Probabilistic event attribution approach based on MIROC5 AGCM ensembles and\
    \ analysis of HAPPI and HAPPI extension runs at different global warming scenarios\
    \ (1.5\xB0C, 2.0\xB0C, 3.0\xB0C)."
  16: "An ensemble mean of climate model simulations (Nat, Hist, 1.5\xBAC, 2.0\xBA\
    C, 3.0\xBAC) is used to analyze the relationships between Ni\xF1o 3.4 warming\
    \ and vertical motion and precipitation anomalies. The results are specifically\
    \ for the year 2015."

    scenarios. The analysis covers June-November of 2006-2016.
More Notes:
  1: The paper suggests future climate policy in equatorial Asia needs to consider
    the effects of climate change on fire regarding both mitigation and adaptation.
    The consideration of fire increases would change global CO2 emissions and mitigation
    strategy.
  2: No relevant information
  7: The potential benefits of limiting current warming trajectory to Paris Agreement
    goals are mentioned as significant; forest-based mitigation is emphasized.
  16: The 'Nat' and 'Hist' scenarios serve as baselines for comparison with the warming
    scenarios. The anomalies are presented in normalized units, making it difficult
    to assess the magnitude of the effects. The analysis focuses on the year 2015.
  18: The analysis focuses on land-use CO2 emissions (including fire emissions) for
    East and South East Asia, excluding China and Japan. The time period for the cumulative
    probability curves is June-November 2006-2016. The emission scenarios are for
    the year 2100.

Quantitative material:
  1: "Projects large probability increases in stronger droughts than the 2015 event\
    \ in 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warmed climates. Projects that if global warming reaches\
    \ 3.0\xB0C, the chances of burned area, CO2 and PM2.5 emissions exceeding the\
    \ 2015 observed values become approximately 100%."

  6: "Historical anthropogenic climate change has increased the chance of \u25B3P\
    \ being more negative than the observed value from 2% (1-4%) in Nat to 9% (6-14%)\
    \ in Hist. In the 1.5\xB0C, 2.0\xB0C and 3.0\xB0C runs, the chance of exceeding\
    \ the observed value significantly increases from 9% (6-14%) in Hist to 82% (76-87%),\
    \ 67% (60-74%), and 93% (89-96%), respectively. Historical anthropogenic drying\
    \ has increased the probability of exceeding the observed values of the burned\
    \ area (from 5% (0-18%) to 23% (3-52%)), CO2 emissions (from 5% (0-15%) to 23%\
    \ (3-47%)), and PM2.5 emissions (from 2% (0-5%) to 24% (3-49%)). In the 1.5\xB0\
    C, 2.0\xB0C and 3.0\xB0C runs, the chances of exceeding the observed values significantly\
    \ increase for the burned area (93% (66-99%), 81% (50-95%) and 98% (84-100%),\
    \ respectively), CO2 emissions (92% (72-98%), 81% (55-93%) and 98% (86-100%),\
    \ respectively), and PM2.5 emissions (93% (70-98%), 81% (54-94%) and 98% (85-100%),\
    \ respectively). Chances of exceeding the land-use CO2 emission scenarios of SSP1,\
    \ 2, 3, 4 and 5 are 77% (70-84%), 34% (28-39%), 13% (10-18%), 37% (31%-41%) and\
    \ 77% (70-84%), respectively, for the EA area, assuming 2.0\xB0C warming."

    P) in 2015 are shown as a function of sea surface temperature differences."
