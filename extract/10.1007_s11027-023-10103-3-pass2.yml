Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change itself adds to adaptation constraints and limits.
  6: Mounting climate vulnerability increases developing countries' cost of debt.
  10: Climate change impacts through risks related to heat, spread of diseases, damages
    to critical infrastructure, and extreme weather events affect human resources
    and economic activity.
  13: Climate change itself negatively affects adaptive capacity.
Highlights:
  2: "For more realistic assessments of sectoral climate risks, assumed levels of\
    \ future adaptive capacity should \u2014 and can \u2014 be usefully constrained\
    \ in assessments that rely on expert judgment, and propose avenues for doing so."
  10: Climatic risks are pervasive across nearly all world regions, affecting human
    resources and economic capacities; Central and South America lack significant
    evidence, denoting a research gap.
  13: Adaptive capacity can be expected to be negatively affected by climate change
    itself; different regions display vastly differing levels of adaptive capacity
    to date and face different types of adaptation constraints and limits.
Methodology:
  6: Uses keywords mirroring adaptation constraints with determinants of adaptive
    capacity to screen regional and sectoral chapters of the AR6 WG2 report, qualitatively
    treating the keywords and descriptions as the dependent variable, and climatic
    effects as the independent variable.
  13: Review of literature to test assumptions of adaptive capacity underlying assessments
    of adaptation feasibility and residual risks.

  13: The paper argues for testing assumptions of adaptive capacity against the available
    literature on relevant climate impacts.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: No relevant information
  6: "Climate change negatively affects developing countries\u2019 access to financial\
    \ markets or risk insurance."
  10: Climatic risks undermine adaptive capacity by placing burdens on governance
    structures and budgets, impacting economic activity through long-term earnings
    reduction, labor capacity, and cognitive function.
  13: Availability of financial resources for Small Island States can be expected
    to further decline due to high exposure of economies to climate hazards.
