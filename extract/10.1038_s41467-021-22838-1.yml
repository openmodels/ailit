Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea level rise caused by anthropogenic climate change, specifically contributing
    to the damages of Hurricane Sandy.
  2: Anthropogenic sea-level rise due to climate change is identified as a worsening
    factor for coastal storm damages.
  3: Global mean sea level rise driven by global temperature changes and anthropogenic
    climate change.
  4: Anthropogenic sea-level rise (ASLR) contributing to increased coastal flooding
    and associated damages.
  5: Anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR)
Highlights:
  1: Anthropogenic sea level rise contributed significantly to the economic damages
    of Hurricane Sandy, accounting for approximately $8.1 billion in damages.
  2: The study emphasizes the significant contribution of human-caused sea-level rise
    to damages from Hurricane Sandy.
  3: The study estimates anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR) from 1900 to 2012 using
    various methods and scenarios, finding consistency across major approaches.
  4: "New York City experienced $1.5B ($0.9B\u2013$2.5B) in damages attributable to\
    \ total ensemble ASLR during Sandy."
  5: ASLR is expected to significantly increase flood damage and exposure in the tri-state
    area, with considerable variation across different states.
Methodology:
  1: Simulated water levels and damage both as they occurred and as they would have
    occurred across a range of lower sea levels corresponding to different estimates
    of attributable sea level rise.
  2: The study employs dynamic flood modeling, spatial error correction, and both
    budget-based and semi-empirical attribution methods to estimate ASLR contributions
    from climate change.
  3: Semi-empirical modeling of global mean sea level rise based on global temperature
    reconstructions and CMIP5 climate model simulations. Counterfactual scenarios
    (stable and cooling temperatures) are used to estimate anthropogenic contributions
    to sea level rise.
  4: Damage estimates attributable to ASLR are developed using hydrodynamic modeling,
    spatial bias correction, and damage modeling.
  5: "Using total ensemble ASLR and full modeling with hydrodynamic simulation, spatial\
    \ correction, and \uFB02ood-depth-based assessment of property damage."
More Notes:
  1: The methodology demonstrated can be applied to impact assessments for other past
    and future coastal storms.
  2: The study does not include or speculate on broader macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes
    beyond localized impact assessments.
  3: The paper focuses on attributing sea level rise to anthropogenic factors by comparing
    historical scenarios with counterfactual scenarios that represent natural climate
    variability.
  5: Estimates of total climate-linked sea level rise in New York largely overlap
    with observations, although not quite as robustly.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic damage in USD
  2: The study quantifies the impact of anthropogenic sea-level rise on economic damages
    from Hurricane Sandy, which can be linked to multi-billion dollar damages.
  3: Estimates of anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR).
  5: Property damage (total in $Billions)
Quantitative material:
  1: "Approximately $8.1B ($4.7B\u2013$14.0B, 5th\u201395th percentiles) of Sandy\u2019\
    s damages are attributable to climate-mediated anthropogenic sea level rise; extension\
    \ of the \uFB02ood area to affect 71 (40\u2013131) thousand additional people."
  2: The median anthropogenic sea-level rise (ASLR) for New York was estimated to
    be 87%, 91%, and 92% of the median global ASLR under low, central, and high attribution
    scenarios, respectively.
  3: Table 1 provides estimates of sea level rise attributable to anthropogenic climate
    change for 1900-2012 in cm, with 50th (5th-95th) percentile ranges for various
    scenarios (Budget reconstructions, Semi-empirical modeling, CMIP5-based temperature,
    Semi-empirical ensemble, and Integrated summary).
  4: "13% of Sandy damages in the tri-state area (New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut)\
    \ are attributable to climate-mediated anthropogenic sea level rise, amounting\
    \ to $8.1B ($4.7B\u2013$14B)."
  5: "Attributable to ASLR, damage (in $Billions) is estimated at $8.1 ($4.7\u2013\
    $14.0) in the tri-state area, $4.2 ($2.4\u2013$6.7) in New York, $3.7 ($2.2\u2013\
    $7.0) in New Jersey, and $0.18 ($0.10\u2013$0.30) in Connecticut."
