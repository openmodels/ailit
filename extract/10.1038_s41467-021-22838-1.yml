Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea level rise caused by anthropogenic climate change, specifically in the context
    of Hurricane Sandy.
  2: The primary driver of risk investigated is climate-mediated anthropogenic sea
    level rise (ASLR).
  3: Global temperature timeseries, stable or cooling temperatures.
  5: The analysis focuses on the increase in flood extent and depths due to ASLR and
    how it impacts human exposure and property damage.
  6: The primary driver of risk is sea level rise associated with anthropogenic climate
    change (ASLR), focusing on its contribution to Hurricane Sandy's impact.
  7: The analysis examines the impact of sea level rise (ASLR) on flood damages, using
    hydrodynamic flood simulations with varying levels of ASLR.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Economic damage and the number of people affected by flooding.
  2: The paper evaluates the flood damages from Hurricane Sandy.
  3: Global mean sea level rise (GMSL) from 1900 to 2012 and attributable sea level
    rise (ASLR).
  5: This study evaluates the impact of anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR) on exposure
    and damage in the tri-state area, focusing on property damage, population, and
    housing exposure due to flooding.
  6: The paper evaluates coastal water levels, flooding, and damage in New York, New
    Jersey, and Connecticut due to Hurricane Sandy.
  7: Property damage is calculated using the standard HAZUS-MH method from the U.S.
    Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Highlights:
  1: Approximately $8.1B of Hurricane Sandy's damages are attributable to climate-mediated
    anthropogenic sea level rise, and the flood area extended to affect 71 thousand
    additional people due to sea level rise.
  2: Human-caused sea level rise contributed to damages associated with Hurricane
    Sandy. The approach demonstrated here may be applied to quantify those damages
    in other coastal floods.
  3: Anthropogenic climate change has contributed to sea level rise from 1900-2012.
    Modelled historical results are broadly consistent with sea level observations
    as well as with budget-based estimates.
  5: The paper finds significant exposure and damage due to ASLR, including an additional
    71,000 people and 36,000 housing units affected in the tri-state area.
  6: The paper aims to estimate sea-level-linked anthropogenic climate damages from
    coastal storms and improve estimates of the costs of climate change. The findings
    suggest ASLR in New York may be lower than globally.
  7: The study uses modeled damages to estimate the fraction of damages attributable
    to ASLR and applies this fraction against total state-reported costs to develop
    dollar value estimates of attributable damages.
Methodology:
  1: Simulates water levels and damage both as they occurred and as they would have
    occurred across a range of lower sea levels corresponding to different estimates
    of attributable sea level rise.
  2: The study uses budget-based and semi-empirical approaches to attribute sea level
    rise. It employs a high-resolution dynamic flood model to simulate Sandy's peak
    flood under actual and counterfactual conditions. It calculates damages based
    on these simulations and estimates the attributable fraction. The budget-based
    attribution collates research on contributions from land-ice melt, ocean thermal
    expansion, and land-water-storage changes.
  3: Semi-empirical modeling based on global temperature timeseries from HadCRUT4
    and CMIP5 historical scenarios, counterfactual GMSL estimates from stable or cooling
    counterfactual scenarios, and CMIP5 natural scenario. Differences between matching
    scenarios provide estimates of anthropogenic sea level rise. Historical and natural-forcing-only
    experiments from CMIP5 are pooled to develop semi-empirical ensemble results.  New
    York-area estimates are derived by multiplying global results by 91%, based on
    the New York/global relationship from a budget-based central scenario.
  5: The study employs hydrodynamic modeling, spatial bias correction, flood-depth-based
    assessment, and different approaches to estimate ASLR and its impacts, referencing
    budget-based and semi-empirical methods.
  6: The paper employs a budget approach to downscale semi-empirical results, applying
    the relationship between global and New York ASLR. They also use semi-empirical
    models and CMIP5 climate model simulations to estimate ASLR.
  7: Hydrodynamic flood simulations are performed using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
    Coastal Storm Modeling System (CSTORM-MS). Damage is calculated based on depth-damage
    curves and maximum damages differentiated for 33 building types. Damages and exposures
    for precise amounts of ASLR are interpolated between results for various water
    levels (from 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, and 24 cm of ASLR).
More Notes:
  2: The study excludes effects of other components of sea level change not caused
    by climate change, such as changes in land-water storage through groundwater extraction
    and surface water impoundment behind dams. The study focuses on the influence
    of climate-linked sea level rise alone and doesn't explicitly model changes to
    storm intensity or track due to climate change.
  5: The study discusses potential underestimation of ASLR impacts due to factors
    like land subsidence not fully accounted for and variability in ocean dynamics.
  6: The study assumes a similar underlying distribution of sea-level-rise components
    (glaciers, Greenland ice sheet) and a negligible contribution from ocean dynamics
    in differentiating New York-area sea level change from global change.
  7: The study performs a spatial bias correction to improve the accuracy of the flood
    modeling, and also tests simpler methods such as flood volume per block as a proxy
    for damage.
