  10: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  2: Uncertainty in climate sensitivities and carbon cycle responses, discount rate
  5: Model uncertainty from climate science (specifically related to the climate emulator's
    equations)
  6: Incorrect calibration of the climate module in DICE-2016, particularly the temperature
    equations and carbon cycle, leading to an oversensitivity of the SCC to the discount
    rate.
  10: Prescribed CO2 emissions and concentrations leading to radiative forcing.
  19: Increase of CO2 concentration; Climate model performance sensitivity to testing
    approach; Carbon emissions; Non-CO2 forcings
  23: Emission of an additional unit of carbon; Temperature increase
  24: Different climate model calibrations (CDICE, HadGEM2-ES, GISS-E2-R, MESMO),
    emission scenarios (RCP8.5, RCP2.6), and growth-adjusted interest rates.
  25: Climate model uncertainty (temperature equation, carbon cycle), discount factor
    (g-adjusted interest rates), emissions scenarios, and the shape of the damage
    function (linear, quadratic, cubic) are the key drivers of risk.
  26: Changes in climate model calibrations, specifically the Equilibrium Climate
    Sensitivity (ECS), and the g-adjusted interest rate
  28: "Uncertainty in climate models (carbon cycle and temperature equations) and\
    \ differences in the IES-parameter \u03C8 (which impacts future g-adjusted interest\
    \ rates)."
  29: Climate calibrations, particularly relating to the carbon cycle and temperature
    equations, TFP growth, population growth
  30: Climate calibrations (different assumptions about climate sensitivity), damage
    function specification (specifically, the DICE-2016 damage function).
  33: The risk drivers include climate model calibration (CDICE vs. DICE-2016), climate
    sensitivity, errors in climate equations and the carbon cycle, and the choice
    of emissions profiles (BAU vs. RCP 2.6).
  34: The growth-adjusted interest rate and social cost of carbon (SCC) are sensitive
    to changes in the curvature of the felicity function and the growth rate assumptions.
  35: "Uncertainty in climate sensitivity (ECS); Uncertainty in the elasticity of\
    \ intertemporal substitution (\u03C8), which influences future interest rates;\
    \ Miscalibration in the DICE-2016 model regarding the timing of climate impacts."
Highlights:
  1: Demonstrates the importance of choosing appropriate model parameters for the
    predicted social cost of carbon.
  2: DICE-2016's climate equations are miscalibrated, leading to potentially unreliable
    predictions. Social cost of carbon in DICE-2016 is oversensitive to the discount
    rate.
  3: The paper aims to close the gap between climate science and climate economics
    by providing a comprehensive and transparent suite of tests for climate emulators
    (CEs).
  5: Climate model calibration significantly impacts the optimal carbon price (social
    cost of carbon). Model uncertainty can change the SCC by a factor of four under
    common damage function assumptions.
  6: DICE-2016's SCC is oversensitive to the discount rate due to flawed climate module
    calibration. In an optimal mitigation scenario, carbon taxes are too low in DICE-2016,
    resulting in a higher predicted temperature than the recalibrated model. The original
    calibration of temperature equations and the carbon cycle in DICE-2016 partially
    offset each other, leading to the wrong results for optimal economic response
    to climate change.
  19: DICE-2016 underestimates temperature changes in idealized CO2 quadrupling tests,
    but performs decently in TCR estimations; CDICE and its extreme scaling variants
    are compatible with CMIP5 models and their TCR; Transient warming remains below
    ECS even after CO2 quadrupling; Model performance varies significantly depending
    on the test used.
  23: In the BAU case of the DICE-2016 model, the effects of the climate model on
    emissions and the interest rates are tiny; If one assumes constant interest rates,
    the SCC relative to output is relatively constant across the next 50 years.
  24: The social cost of carbon is sensitive to climate model calibration, emission
    scenarios, and growth-adjusted interest rates. The functional form of the damage
    function has a significant impact on the effect of climate model uncertainty on
    the SCC.
  25: Model uncertainty in the temperature equation significantly impacts the SCC.
    The shape of the damage function (linear, quadratic, cubic) is crucial in determining
    how SCC responds to different emission scenarios, and the magnitude of model uncertainty.
    Discounting does not greatly change relative uncertainty for g-adjusted interest
    rates above 2%.
  26: Simply varying the ECS in the climate emulator is not sufficient to model climate
    uncertainty, as it incorrectly reduces the uncertainty about the SCC. For intermediate
    values of the discount factor (around 0.97), the SCC for CDICE and DICE-2016 is
    very similar. DICE-2016 underestimates the SCC substantially at a discount factor
    of 0.96, and overestimates it at a discount factor of 0.99.
  28: Different reasonable calibrations for the climate CE can have large effects
    on optimal abatement. The DICE-2016 model contains an incorrect calibration. The
    emissions are not sensitive to the climate calibration used.
  29: Different climate calibrations imply vastly different predictions for CO2 concentrations
    and damages; extreme carbon cycle and temperature equations yield extreme damages;
    SCC initially falls over time due to a rise in the growth-adjusted interest rate.
  30: Optimal emissions remain far above RCP 2.6 scenarios, implying that the optimal
    temperature rises far above the Paris limit. Large differences in damages and
    the SCC across calibrations imply large differences in the optimal solution. Differences
    in the social cost of carbon translate mechanically into differences in optimal
    abatement.
  33: DICE-2016 leads to much larger damages and much higher temperatures than CDICE,
    yet the SCC is almost identical; Discounting is crucial for the small differences
    in abatement between the two calibrations; The temperature differences between
    CDICE and DICE-2016 only become significant in 75 years and are heavily discounted.
  34: The social cost of carbon varies significantly based on the IES value, with
    impacts larger than 50% between the lower and higher bounds.
  35: "Differences in optimal policies are very large between different \u03C8 cases.\
    \ The miscalibration in DICE-2016 amplifies the effect of \u03C8 uncertainty.\
    \ Optimal long-run temperatures in DICE-2016 are far above values in CDICE, and\
    \ the spread is widened by different values of \u03C8. Future interest rates and\
    \ growth rates matter a lot for optimal mitigation."
Methodology:
  1: The paper proposes a generic and transparent calibration and evaluation strategy
    for climate emulators using state-of-the-art benchmark data from climate sciences.
  2: Re-calibration of the DICE-2016 climate model using CMIP5 data, examining social
    cost of carbon in partial and general equilibrium settings.
  3: The CE calibrations and test cases used here are all based on CMIP5 data. A recalibrated
    version of the DICE-2016 model called 'Calibrated DICE' (CDICE) is developed.
  5: A simple partial equilibrium setup is used, taking emissions, growth rate, and
    interest rate as exogenously given. An aggregate damage function determines the
    fraction of output destroyed as a function of temperature.
  6: The authors use the DICE-2016 model and their recalibrated versions ('CDICE')
    in a general equilibrium framework to compute the SCC and optimal mitigation.
    They compare their recalibrated model to DICE-2016 using the same economic parameters.
  10: The paper uses CMIP5 climate model output under various RCP scenarios to illustrate
    the evolution of CO2 emissions, concentrations, and radiative forcing. It also
    discusses the limitations of simple Climate emulators (CEs) like DICE compared
    to more complex Earth System Models (ESMs) for impact assessment.
  19: Compares DICE-2016 and a new version (CDICE) with CMIP5 models under idealized
    CO2 increase scenarios (1% per year) and CMIP5 historical and RCP evolution scenarios;
    Assesses model performance based on temperature response to CO2 concentration
    changes.
  23: IAMs compute the net present value of all future damages caused by the emission
    of an additional unit of carbon; the effect of extra emissions on damages depends
    on the calibration of the damage function and the path of emissions; assumes constant
    interest and growth rates to make general statements about the SCC.
  24: Compares SCC under different climate calibrations and emission scenarios using
    a quadratic damage function, relative to a baseline CDICE calibration. The analysis
    examines how the SCC changes with varying growth-adjusted interest rates. The
    study emphasizes that the functional form of the damage function is important
    to the effect of climate model uncertainty on the SCC.
  25: The analysis uses stylized exercises to assess the impact of model uncertainty,
    discount rates, and emission scenarios on the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) under
    different damage functions (linear, quadratic, cubic).
  26: Compares SCC across different climate-economic models and calibrations, analyzing
    the impact of varying the ECS and the g-adjusted interest rate on the relative
    SCC. The quadratic damage function and RCP8.5 scenario are used.
  28: The paper uses the DICE-2016 model and a modified version called CDICE, combined
    with different CMIP5 calibrations for carbon cycle and temperature equations,
    to explore the economic consequences of climate model uncertainty. Deep equilibrium
    nets are used to compute global solutions.
  29: Uses the DICE-2016 model with different climate calibrations for the carbon
    cycle and temperature equations.
  30: The paper uses the DICE-2016 model to optimize mitigation choices and analyzes
    the resulting emissions, temperature changes, and SCC under different climate
    calibrations. The social planner optimally chooses mitigation.
  33: The analysis compares two climate-economic models (CDICE and DICE-2016) under
    different scenarios (BAU, optimal abatement, RCP 2.6 emissions profile) to assess
    the impact of climate change and mitigation policies.
  34: "The analysis uses different values of the IES, \u03C8, within the DICE-2016\
    \ calibration to study effects on interest rates and SCC."
  35: "Compares optimal abatement and temperature pathways under different values\
    \ of \u03C8 and different climate calibrations (DICE-2016 vs. CDICE, and variations\
    \ in ECS)."
More Notes:
  5: The study focuses on the climate part of integrated assessment models like DICE-2016,
    examining the carbon cycle and temperature equations. The authors re-calibrate
    the climate component of DICE, arguing that its functional form is fit for purpose.
    RCP85 and RCP26 are mentioned in passing, and a specific W/m2 associated with
    each is specified.
  6: The paper details the model specifications and recalibrations in online Appendix
    B, including DICE versions from 2007, 2016, and the authors' CDICE version.
  10: The paper focuses on the challenges of calibrating and evaluating climate emulators
    (CEs) for use in economic models, specifically regarding the representation of
    forcings, response time scales, and the choice of appropriate metrics. The paper
    compares CEs against ESMs. The paper mentions benchmarking data for atmospheric
    temperature from the CMIP5 archive.
  12: This page focuses on the calibration and testing of a climate model (CE) within
    an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM), specifically using the DICE-2016 model as
    an example. It discusses the importance of properly calibrating the carbon cycle
    and temperature equations within these models but does not directly present national-level
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes or adaptation cost-benefit analyses. It does
    not quantify any climate change outcomes on the macroeconomy.
  19: The study highlights the importance of using realistic scenarios and considering
    non-CO2 forcings when evaluating climate-economic models. The model's ability
    to capture regime transitions from emission-dominated to response-dominated scenarios
    is also examined.
  23: The paper focuses on the somewhat arbitrary date 2020 for reporting the SCC;
    Output growth can come from population growth as well as total factor productivity
    (TFP) growth.
  24: The paper normalizes the SCC for the RCP 2.6 scenario with the basic CDICE model
    to one, allowing for a relative comparison of different models. The study suggests
    higher-order terms in the damage function can make a significant difference.
  25: The relative uncertainty introduced by climate model uncertainty does not change
    much with discounting, at least for g-adjusted interest rates above 2%. The relationship
    between emissions scenarios and SCC depends on the shape of the damage function,
    which can be influenced by the concavity in the forcing equation countering the
    convexity of damages.
  26: The speed of warming is often more important than the very long-run behavior
    of temperature when calculating the social cost of carbon.
  29: Emissions from DICE-16 lie somewhere between RCP6 and RCP85.
  30: The analysis is highly dependent on the choice of the damage function. The model
    does not allow for carbon removal. GDP growth increases SCC, but relative SCC
    is almost identical to the BAU case. The optimal tax on carbon is equal to the
    SCC.
  33: The paper highlights the importance of discounting in climate-economic models
    and how it can mask the long-term differences between different climate model
    calibrations; Also notes that DICE-2016 has offsetting errors in the BAU scenario.

  32: This page focuses on comparing two climate models (CDICE and DICE-2016) and
    their implications for optimal abatement policies and temperature projections,
    but does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, costs/benefits
    of adaptation, or the drivers of economic risk related to climate change at a
    national level. The discussion revolves around the carbon cycle, temperature response,
    and calibration differences between the two models.

Quantitative material:
  2: Model uncertainty can change the social cost of carbon by a factor of 4 if one
    assumes a quadratic damage function.
  5: Model uncertainty from climate science can change the social cost of carbon by
    a factor of four if one assumes a quadratic damage function.
  6: "The DICE-2016 model's long-run temperature is substantially higher (about 1\xB0\
    C) than the author's calibration in both BAU and optimally mitigated scenarios."
  19: Temperature change projections (K) over 140 years under different CO2 concentration
    scenarios (1% per year increase, doubling within 70 years, quadrupling within
    140 years); TCR values for CMIP5 models (1.3 K to 2.3 K); ECS values for CMIP5
    models (2.05 K to 4.55 K); ECS exceeds transient temperature change by about 40%
    to 70% after quadrupling of CO2.
  23: Exogenous forcing (F_EXt) changes linearly with time from 0.5 in the year 2015
    to 1.0 in 2100 (as specified in DICE-2016) and F_EXt = 0.3 * F_CO2t.
  24: The figure displays the SCC under different RCP emission scenarios and climate
    model calibrations relative to the CDICE MMM social cost of carbon for RCP26,
    with growth-adjusted interest rates ranging from 0.5% to 4% and the SCC normalized
    to one for the CDICE RCP2.6 scenario.
  25: The SCC can vary by a factor of three to five based on optimistic vs. pessimistic
    temperature scenarios; a pessimistic carbon cycle increases SCC by about 20%;
    with cubic damages the SCC can be almost eight times higher for the most pessimistic
    climate scenario compared to the most optimistic.
  26: Compares SCC values for different calibrations (CDICE, DICE-2016, HadGEM2-ES,
    GISS-E2-R) relative to CDICE at t=5 (2020) with various ECS values (2.15 and 4.55),
    and their impacts on SCC.
  29: Range of plausible damages in 300 years goes from around three percent of GDP
    to over 17.5% of GDP.
  30: Optimal emissions remain far above RCP 2.6 emissions in all cases. In the MMM
    calibration, temperature rises by 3 K and stays at that level for hundreds of
    years. In the most pessimistic climate calibration, the optimal temperature rises
    by over 4 K. The model's optimal tax (equal to the SCC) for the MMM case lies
    slightly below what is typically discussed for economic policy purposes.
  33: DICE-2016 can lead to temperature rises of more than 4K under optimal mitigation;
    DICE-2016 warms by more than 2.5 K with RCP 2.6 emissions profile; CDICE warms
    by 2.1 K with RCP 2.6; CDICE optimal abatement can keep warming below 1.7K.
  34: "Differences in growth-adjusted interest rates between \u03C8 = 0.5 and \u03C8\
    \ = 2 after 200 years are almost a factor of 2."
  35: "Optimal warming under DICE-2016 can reach almost 6 degrees Celsius in 200 years\
    \ for a high ECS and high \u03C8; even for the MMM calibration, high \u03C8 implies\
    \ warming by more than 4.5 K."
