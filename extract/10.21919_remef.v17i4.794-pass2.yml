Drivers of Risk:
  1: Rising temperatures, droughts, extreme rainfall, rising sea levels.
  2: Every increase in global warning will cause more changes in the mean temperature,
    precipitation, and soil humidity in regions of the world and every ton of CO2
    emissions increases global warming; extreme events (heat waves, drouth, extreme
    precipitation, hurricanes, etc.) have increased since the 1950s and they are projected
    to continue to increase according to the level of future warming; compound extreme
    events (i.e. drought and heatwaves) have also increased in recent decades.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Shifted rainfall patterns and dramatic warming in the Arctic.
  5: Key drivers of risk include rising temperatures, sea level rise, intense wildfires,
    droughts, and extreme weather events such as floods and hurricanes.
  6: Increased temperatures, extreme weather events like tropical storms and hurricanes,
    rising sea levels, and ocean acidification.
  7: The primary drivers of risk identified are storms (tropical cyclones and thunderstorms),
    droughts, and heat waves. The paper mentions urban sprawl, increasing vulnerability
    of assets along the shore, and climate change as factors exacerbating these risks.
  8: Heatwaves, drought, storms, extreme precipitation, decline in snow and ice, decreased
    precipitation, compound events (heat waves and drought), increasing and frequent
    storms, hurricanes, greater temperatures, ice or freezing rain, and wildfires.
  10: The paper identifies changes in temperature and precipitation as drivers of
    risk, impacting water-borne diseases, acute respiratory tract infections, nutritional
    issues, dengue, and asthma. Climatic events (heatwaves or hurricanes) can directly
    or indirectly (i.e., malnutrition, anxiety about climate change) impact mental
    health.
  11: Shocks and changes impacting outcomes include climate occurrences like droughts,
    floods, heat waves, rising atmospheric carbon dioxide, and increasing temperatures.
  12: Sea level rise and extreme events like hurricanes and tidal flooding are impacting
    coastal areas in North America.
  13: Physical changes in the environment due to climate change, leading to financial
    and pricing instability.
  14: Extreme events have damaged economically important supply-chain infrastructure
    and disrupted regional and international trade.

    in North America.
Highlights:
  1: Without immediate action, adaptation to climate change will be more difficult
    and costly, particularly for the most vulnerable social groups and economic activities
    and ecosystems in the area. It is necessary to delve into the impacts of climate
    change at the subnational level in the North American region and in Mexico.
  2: There is a small window of opportunity (10 years) to strengthen and enhance adaptation
    responses to climate change.
  3: No relevant information
  5: North America is experiencing increased frequency and intensity of climate-related
    events; indigenous people and urban zones are more vulnerable; coastal areas face
    greater property risks due to sea level rise and increased storm frequency.
  6: Increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, potential severe
    impacts on agriculture and GDP, and ocean acidification effects on marine life
    and coastal tourism.
  7: The paper emphasizes the significant economic losses associated with storms,
    particularly hurricanes and thunderstorms. It highlights the increasing frequency
    of extreme dry and hot weather due to climate change and the potential for loss
    across various sectors.
  8: Observed climate impacts illustrate current vulnerability of energy facilities
    in several parts of North America. Projected impacts of extremes events will affect
    North America regions both in energy infrastructures as well as consumption.
  10: The paper highlights the insufficient financial support for health adaptation
    and the observed association between high temperatures and mental health decrements.
    It emphasizes the need for broader attention to the health dimension of climate
    change, particularly in Mexico, and the mental health implications of climate
    change. The research found no comprehensive assessment of the health implications
    of climate change at the national and subnation level in the three countries.
  11: Climate change may challenge traditional agriculture, livestock raising, and
    fishing practices in North America, potentially affecting economic health, social
    wellbeing, and infrastructure.
  12: Delaying climate resilience investment from 2020 to 2030 could cost at least
    USD 1 trillion; Extensive evidence of climate-related disasters' economic costs
    in North American cities, such as Hurricane Sandy's $60 billion damage.
  13: Financial sector interest in climate change is small and mainly concentrated
    on mitigation, not adaptation.
  14: System transformation to adapt to climate change are advancing slowly and unevenly
    in the region.
  15: Societies in North America face a critical moment due to declining economic
    yields, worsening social well-being, and ecosystem degradation caused by climate
    change, yet adaptation efforts are limited.
Methodology:
  1: "Reflection on the evidence recently produced by the Working Group 2 of the IPCC.\
    \ Evaluation methods of the information used for the report on \u201CImpacts,\
    \ adaptation and Vulnerability\u201D are based on impacts and adaptation assessments\
    \ revised in the available literature on the topic."
  3: No relevant information
  13: No relevant information
More Notes:
  1: The article is based on the IPCC AR6 report.
  2: The paper summarizes key messages of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Reports and presents
    selected data and information of North America as a context. It considers the
    challenge of climate change for economic growth in North America, and discusses
    financial options for mitigation and adaptation.
  3: This paper primarily summarizes IPCC reports (WGII and WGIII). The information
    about adaptation actions being short-term oriented and not comprehensively implemented,
    with a growing gap between planned and implemented adaptation, is relevant. The
    mention of Climate Resilience Development (CRD) as an operational concept combining
    adaptation and mitigation to enhance sustainable development is also important.
  4: This page provides a general overview of North America and its climate, as well
    as some general statements about the impacts of climate change on the region.
    It does not provide specific details about outcomes, quantitative information,
    or methodology, but it does establish the context for further analysis.
  5: The report emphasizes the vulnerability of Mexico due to both geographical factors
    and socioeconomic conditions such as poverty and inequality.
  13: The paper discusses the role of financial institutions, regulators, and central
    banks in addressing climate change and the challenges in financing adaptation
    efforts in North America.
  14: The paper emphasizes the urgency of adaptation in North America, particularly
    in the U.S. and Mexico, where adaptation has received less attention than mitigation.
    Adaptation actions at the subnational level face challenges due to political and
    ideological positions.
  15: The paper stresses the negative consequences of inaction on climate change,
    particularly for vulnerable groups, and highlights the economic benefits of early
    adaptation actions.
Quantitative material:
  3: No relevant information
  5: Northern Mexico could see temperature increases of 3 to 4 degrees Celsius by
    the end of the century, while the country as a whole could experience rises of
    1.5 to 2.5 degrees Celsius.
  6: "Projected temperature increase of 1.5\xB0C to 2\xB0C in northern Mexico by 2039;\
    \ potential GDP per capita impact of 7% to 12%; projected crop yield reductions\
    \ of 5%-20% in the near term and up to 80% by century's end."
  7: The total losses from severe weather events increased by 15% (US$ 160 billion),
    with heat waves, droughts, and wildfires accounting for more than half of this.
  10: The paper notes that financial support for health adaptation is currently less
    than 0.5% of overall dispersed multilateral climate finance projects. It also
    notes that suicide rates rise 0.7% in U.S. counties and 2.1% in Mexican municipalities
    for a 1oC increase in monthly average temperature.
  11: Projected annual damages to U.S. infrastructure from temperature and precipitation-related
    factors are up to $20 billion under RCP8.5 by 2090; inland flooding could cost
    $1.2 to $1.4 billion annually by 2050.
  12: Estimated $90 trillion will be invested in urban development by 2030; Direct
    economic costs of extreme events in 2020 reached $210-268 billion USD; sea levels
    have risen ~8 cm in the last 20 years, causing a 233% increase in flooding.
