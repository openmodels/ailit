Drivers of Risk:
  6: Increase in average temperatures; increase in the intensity of tropical cyclones;
    changes in temperature and precipitation; rising sea levels; increase in the concentration
    of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
  9: Water shortages affecting hydro-electric and thermoelectric plants; Changes in
    climate affecting renewable energy performance; Higher temperatures and heat waves
    affecting worker productivity; Extreme climatic occurrences damaging physical
    capital; Climate change impacting ski resorts; Loss in agricultural productivity,
    sea level rise, health effects
  11: No relevant information
  12: Climate change poses a risk to infrastructure.
  14: Extreme events have damaged economically important supply-chain infrastructure,
    disrupted regional and international trade, increased public expenditures on emergency
    and recovery response, and affected property and financial markets.
Highlights:
  6: Extreme events in Mexico have increased in the form of tropical storms, hurricanes,
    fires and heat waves.
  9: Climate change has and it will continue to have significant differentiated impact
    in North America. Impacts are expected to increase for the frequency and intensity
    of extreme weather, both in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
  11: No relevant information
  14: System transformation to adapt to climate change is advancing slowly and unevenly
    across North America; national political support is essential but currently challenging;
    adaptation efforts vary significantly across subnational regions.
Methodology:
  6: "The paper provides a reflection based on the IPCC Report AR6 \u2013 2022"
  9: Intertemporal CGE trade model to account for the various effects of global warming
    (e.g., loss in agricultural productivity, sea level rise, health effects) on Gross
    Domestic Product growth for 139 countries by decade and over the long run.

More Notes:
  6: This paper only contains an overview, and doesn't present new analysis.
  10: This page primarily focuses on the health impacts of climate change and doesn't
    offer direct macroeconomic or macro-fiscal analysis at a national level. It mainly
    highlights the lack of comprehensive assessment of health implications and the
    need for greater attention to mental health in the context of climate change,
    especially in Mexico.
  11: This paper primarily summarizes the findings of other papers related to climate
    change impacts in North America. It does not present any original analysis or
    results.
  12: This paper focuses on the North America region.
  14: Different capacities to respond to climate change in Canada, the USA, and Mexico
    due to varying development levels and resources; adaptation has received less
    attention than mitigation.
