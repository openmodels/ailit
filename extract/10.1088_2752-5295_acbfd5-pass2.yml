Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change
  3: Extreme monsoon rainfall and flooding in Pakistan attributed to climate change.
  4: Record-breaking monsoon rainfall; Overflowing Indus River; Urban flash floods,
    landslides and Glacial Lake Outburst Floods; High population density and high
    rates of poverty; Increasing variability of weather systems due to climate change;
    Largely arid desert climate and severe heatwaves.
  10: Changes in rainfall patterns, specifically extreme rainfall events (maximum
    60-day rainfall in the Indus Basin and maximum 5-day average rainfall in southern
    provinces).
  11: Extreme rainfall events in the Indus River basin, influenced by global mean
    surface temperature (GMST).
  14: Heavy rainfall, extensive flooding, dam and barrage-related backwater effects,
    reduced water and sediment conveyance capacity, multiple failures of infrastructure.
  16: Heavy rainfall and ensuing floods are primary drivers. Development in flood-prone
    areas is a contributing factor to high infrastructure damages. Household flood
    vulnerability is affected by socio-economic and demographic attributes, house
    construction material, past experiences with floods, and social networks. Poverty,
    poorly constructed houses, location in flood-prone areas, and distance from health
    facilities contribute to vulnerability. Women's lack of mobility and traditional
    roles increase their vulnerability.
  17: High variability in rainfall and short observational datasets contribute to
    the uncertainty in estimates.
  18: Extreme peaks in rainfall over Pakistan in light of human-caused climate change;
    Proximity of human settlements, infrastructure, and agricultural land to floodplains;
    Limited ex-ante risk reduction capacity; Outdated river management system; Underlying
    vulnerabilities driven by poverty; Socioeconomic factors that disadvantage women;
    Ongoing political and economic instability.
Highlights:
  3: Intense rainfall in Pakistan has increased as the climate has warmed, with some
    models suggesting rainfall intensity could have increased up to 50% due to climate
    change.
  10: Extreme rainfall events in the Indus Basin and southern provinces have return
    periods of approximately 100 years in the current climate. Multiple climate models
    are used to analyze and project rainfall patterns and extreme events.
  11: The study analyzes the relationship between global warming and extreme rainfall
    in the Indus River basin, focusing on the 2022 event. It provides return period
    estimates for different climate scenarios. The paper calculates probability ratios
    (PR) and changes in intensity.
  14: "Heavy rainfall events are projected to become more intense and frequent in\
    \ the Indus River basin, Balochistan, and Sindh, even with a relatively small\
    \ increase in global temperature (0.8\xB0C above pre-industrial). The probability\
    \ of a 100-year 5-day rainfall event is projected to increase by up to 40% in\
    \ Balochistan and Sindh with the specified temperature increase."
  16: The 2022 floods caused significant infrastructure damage, estimated at US$30
    billion. Flood mitigation walls and improved preparedness contributed to lower
    mortality rates in some areas. Household vulnerability is influenced by a range
    of socio-economic and demographic factors. Women are disproportionately affected
    due to their limited mobility and traditional roles.
  17: The 60-day rain across the basin is now about 50% more intense, indicating that
    heavy rainfall is now more likely.
  18: Climate change indeed increased the rainfall intensity (up to 50% in some models)
    for the 5-day rainfall extreme. There is an urgent need to reduce vulnerability
    to extreme weather in Pakistan.
Methodology:
  1: Attribution study of the 2022 Pakistan floods
  3: Probabilistic event attribution and a detailed assessment of dynamics used to
    understand climate change's role in the event.
  10: The study uses observational rainfall data from CPC, ERA5, and IMERG, and climate
    model ensembles (CORDEX South Asia, GFDL-CM2.5/FLOR, and HighResMIP SST-forced
    model ensemble) to analyze rainfall patterns. Models are evaluated based on their
    ability to reproduce seasonal cycles, spatial patterns of rainfall, and return
    periods of extreme events. Model biases are also checked, and models with large
    biases in 100-year return values for 5-day events are discarded.
  14: "Analysis compares rainfall intensity and probability ratios under different\
    \ climate scenarios (0.8\xB0C warmer than pre-industrial levels) using various\
    \ climate models. Findings are applicable to the Indus River basin, Balochistan,\
    \ and Sindh regions."
  18: Trends in climate models with and without human-induced increases in greenhouse
    gases were examined. Evaluation tests were performed on climate models. Statistical
    methods, including the Clausius-Clayperon relationship, were used.
More Notes:
  1: This page is from a repository copy and primarily provides citation and licensing
    information. The full article likely contains more detailed analysis relevant
    to macroeconomic and fiscal risks.
  10: The study uses a multi-model approach to account for model uncertainty. The
    focus is on rainfall and extreme rainfall events, serving as physical risk drivers.
    The models are evaluated based on various rainfall characteristics with the confidence
    intervals overlapping between models and observations being essential.
  11: Supplementary materials contain additional details (section S3) and tables of
    results.
  14: "The paper notes that the structural causes of vulnerability and exposure to\
    \ flooding in downstream Pakistan remain a significant challenge despite existing\
    \ knowledge of flood patterns. Projections are compatible with but slightly larger\
    \ than what would be expected from the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron relationship."
  18: Rebuilding following the disaster also provides an opportunity to strengthen
    resilience and avoid future risk through stronger infrastructure designed for
    the new climate and considerations of flood risk when deciding where to rebuild.

Quantitative material:
  4: Record rainfall between 1st and 31st August over Sindh and Balochistan was 726%
    and 590% of the usual totals for August (since 1961) in the respective regions;
    Pakistan as a whole received 243% more rainfall than usual during this period;
    1.7 million homes destroyed; Nearly 1500 people died; 6700 kilometers of road,
    269 bridges and 1460 health facilities were destroyed; 18590 schools were damaged;
    750000 livestock were killed; Around 18000 square kilometres of cropland were
    ruined, including roughly 45% of the cotton crop; Loss of food crops totalling
    around US$2.3 billion.
  10: Return periods of extreme rainfall events are estimated to be around 100 years
    in the current (2022) climate. Precipitation data (mm/day) from CPC, ERA5, and
    IMERG datasets are shown in graphs for the Indus River basin and the southern
    provinces of Balochistan and Sindh.
  11: "The paper presents figures showing relationships between GMST and 60-day average\
    \ rainfall, return periods for extreme rainfall events under different climate\
    \ scenarios (2022 climate vs. 1.2\xB0C cooler climate), and probability ratios\
    \ (PRs) and intensity changes for individual models. The analysis includes specific\
    \ data related to the 2022 rainfall event."
  14: "The 100-year 60-day heavy rainfall event over the Indus river basin will be\
    \ 15-25% more intense, and the probability of such an event increases by 1.3-2\
    \ times, comparing a 0.8 \u25E6 C warmer climate (2 \u25E6 C since pre-industrial).\
    \ The 100-year 5-day heavy rainfall event over the region encompassing Balochistan\
    \ and Sindh will be 10-30% more intense, and the probability of such an event\
    \ increases by 1.5-40%, comparing a 0.8 \u25E6 C warmer climate (2 \u25E6 C since\
    \ pre-industrial)."
  16: Over 1.7 million homes, 6,700 kilometers of road, 269 bridges, and 1,460 health
    facilities damaged in 2022 floods. Early estimates of US$30 billion in damages.
    World Bank Sindh Resilience project reported seven million people now receive
    timely and more accurate early warning notifications (as of 2021).
  18: For the 5-day rainfall extreme, most models and observations analysed show that
    intense rainfall has become heavier as the world has warmed, and that climate
    change indeed increased the rainfall intensity up to 50% as the best estimate
    in some models.
