Drivers of Risk:
  1: This page doesn't explicitly mention drivers of risk, but implicitly addresses
    the uncertainty in existing forest carbon offset methodologies as a barrier to
    effective carbon markets and slowing deforestation. The protocol addresses this
    uncertainty. Carbon pricing is a major driver of revenue, and thus of the incentives
    for forest restoration and management.
  2: Uncertainty for forest carbon sequestration is a driver of risk. Estimation protocols
    not directly observing forest CO2 fluxes introduce uncertainty. Reliance on forest
    mensuration (every 6 or 12 years) coupled with tree growth simulation models also
    introduces uncertainty.
  5: Fire and deforestation are mentioned as events that could reduce photosynthesis.
  6: No relevant information
  11: The paper mentions intentional and unintentional forest carbon reversals and
    conditions beyond the scope of the study that could impact NEE.
  17: Differences in stand age, history of disturbance, and potential larger respiration
    rates in tropical forests impact NEE.
  18: The primary driver of risk is variability in carbon prices ($5-$36/tCO2eq) and
    variance in market sales (+/- 20%), as well as project type (Harvard Forest, Ankasa
    Park) and payment structure.
  19: "Rainfall and related ecological factors are identified as impacting local sequestration\
    \ strength and project value. Market uncertainty is also identified as a driver\
    \ of risk, with a \xB120% variance considered."
  21: Extreme weather conditions (excluding catastrophic events such as wildfire,
    multiyear drought, and hurricane) can impact annual data intervals.
  22: "The anomalously low NEE for HF year 2010 (\u22120.53 tCO2eq), associated with\
    \ drought demonstrates the requirement for ecosystem respiration measurement for\
    \ NEE."
  24: The risk driver is a switch from carbon negative to carbon positive ecosystem
    function, indicating a net release of CO2 into the atmosphere.

Highlights:
  1: The Direct Measurement Forest Carbon Protocol TM is a commercial system-of-systems
    designed to incentivize forest restoration and management by providing more accurate
    and reliable carbon sequestration data. It aims to address uncertainties in current
    forest carbon offset methodologies and create new economic incentives to reverse
    deforestation. The protocol has the potential to significantly increase revenue
    compared to contemporary voluntary offsets.
  2: Multinational policy applications such as the Paris Agreement and the United
    Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation will benefit from
    NEE measurement avoiding unsupported claims of emission reduction, fraud, and
    forest conservation policy failure.
  5: A negative NEE flux represents a net carbon sink, while a positive NEE represents
    a net carbon source.
  6: "The Direct Measurement and Financial Compensation Program (DMFCP) aims to create\
    \ carbon credits or offsets based on negative NEE (CO\u2082 sink or emission reduction).\
    \ It offers upfront payments and annual royalty payments to landowners."
  7: NEE records reductions in photosynthesis caused by fire and deforestation, should
    these events occur in the project areas. The DMFCP process simplifies existing
    protocols for forest carbon sequestration (Table 1).
  11: HF and AP sites showed negative annual NEE values, indicating active forest
    carbon sequestration. The DMFCP provides a framework for verified tradeable GHG
    financial products.
  17: The tropical wet evergreen forest site (Ankasa Park) experienced consistently
    greater sequestration of carbon than the temperate deciduous forest (Harvard Forest)
    over the period, though this may not translate to larger long-term carbon sinks.
    Both locations show a decreasing trend in NEE over time.
  18: Landowner cash flow increases with higher carbon prices. The payment structure
    (upfront vs. royalty) and site (HF vs. AP) significantly impact cash flow.
  19: "Harvard Forest consistently shows higher cash flow at the lowest sequestration\
    \ rate (0.50 tCO\u2082 acre\u207B\xB9 yr\u207B\xB9), while Ankasa Park shows higher\
    \ cash flow at the median sequestration rate (4.0 tCO\u2082 acre\u207B\xB9 yr\u207B\
    \xB9) but falls below Harvard Forest at the maximum rate (10.25 tCO\u2082 acre\u207B\
    \xB9 yr\u207B\xB9). Mixed carbon products and pricing for voluntary, compliance,\
    \ and regulatory markets can yield higher potential revenue."
  21: "Pre-tax revenue for mixed carbon products and pricing is projected at up to\
    \ $16,380,000 for the HF over the 24-year period, an \u223C5\xD7 and \u223C2\xD7\
    \ return compared to pricing of $5 and $10 tCO2eq, respectively."
  22: The approach is a game-changer for creation and verification of forest carbon
    financial products compared to estimation and model simulation-based protocols.
  24: Traditional forest carbon protocols may not be capable of determining when a
    forest project switches to net positive emissions on an annual basis. DMFCP NEE
    measurements provide this diagnostic. Traditional protocols require an arbitrary
    100-year monitoring period, while DMFCP employs ton-year accounting.
  26: The DMFCP enables the creation of verified forest carbon financial products,
    contributes to improved methods for large-scale forest conservation and reforestation,
    and can be applied to GHGs across large scales and diverse locations. It also
    corrects gaps in validation and recalibrates equivalent voluntary and compliance
    programs, potentially addressing ~0.9 billion hectares of restorable landscapes.

Methodology:
  1: The Direct Measurement Forest Carbon Protocol TM is based on standardized methods
    for direct determination of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 employing eddy
    covariance. The system uses a System-of-Systems TM (SoS) network architecture
    with sensor nodes (Global Monitoring Platform TM) housing analyzers for CO2 isotopologues
    and greenhouse gases. Published annual NEE data from Ankasa Park, Ghana, and Harvard
    Forest, Petersham, MA, USA are used to forecast carbon revenue. Results are applicable
    at the scale of forest carbon sequestration projects. Analysis performed used
    data from 2019-2020.
  2: The paper discusses how forest mensuration is conducted every 6 or 12 years and
    coupled with tree growth simulation models to infer annual changes in net forest
    carbon offsets.
  5: NEE is calculated as GPP + R_eco, where GPP is gross primary production and R_eco
    is ecosystem respiration. R_eco is further broken down into autotrophic respiration
    (R_a) and heterotrophic respiration (R_h).
  6: "Direct Field Measurement of NEE (CO\u2082, CH\u2084, and N\u2082O) relative\
    \ to a zero-emission baseline is employed. Ex-ante, annual accreditation periods\
    \ can be applied to multiple GHGs. There is an exit from a landowner agreement\
    \ after 10 years with a penalty according to a ton-year accounting calculation.\
    \ Multiple projects are grouped into pooled portfolios and subject to verification\
    \ of system performance by external third-party verifiers."
  7: The study accessed NEE data from online data sources and transformed it into
    tones carbon dioxide equivalent per acre per year. The NEE values are then extrapolated
    to larger areas (100,000 acres) to illustrate GHG balance and potential revenue
    for large-scale projects. The paper also mentions the use of standing carbon inventory
    derived from biometric or remote sensing methods to augment and cross-check project
    NEE data.
  8: The page describes the use of eddy covariance tower data from Ankasa Park, Ghana,
    collected between 2011 and 2014. The data (NEE) are from the Fluxnet database,
    gap-filled, filtered, and corrected for low friction velocity periods.
  11: The DMFCP (Digital Measurement, Finance, and Carbon Protocol) uses hardware
    and software to function as an automated commercial field sensor network for GHG
    flux measurements. Measurements of GHG fluxes are used against local, regional,
    and global reference materials for bulk and isotopic composition.
  17: The analysis uses time series data of NEE from Harvard Forest and Ankasa Park
    from 1990 to 2020. Linear trend lines are fitted to the cumulative NEE data. The
    analysis is applicable to understanding carbon sequestration trends in these specific
    forest ecosystems.
  18: The analysis extrapolates measured local Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) to 100,000
    acres and multiplies it by the annual NEE record for each site (Harvard Forest
    and Ankasa Park). The analysis models two hypothetical payment scenarios (single
    upfront payment vs. upfront payment plus annual royalty).
  19: The study uses continuous eddy covariance measurements for determination of
    NEE for forest carbon. They use the minimum, mean, and maximum values for NEE
    recorded at each site to illustrate the effect of variable annual sequestration
    rate on pre-tax revenue, extrapolated to 100,000 acres (40,469 hectares).
  21: Hypothetical financial structure and cases for pre-tax revenue for landowners
    are used to illustrate the potential impact of the DMFCP.
  22: Scale-up of eddy covariance flux tower data combined with remote sensing data
    is under active study and directly relevant to developing approaches for the SoS.
  24: The paper compares a novel Direct Measurement and Financial Carbon Protocol
    (DMFCP) to traditional forest carbon protocols (e.g., California Air Resources
    Board, CAR). DMFCP relies on real-time wireless reporting and verification.
  26: The paper discusses the DMFCP (a commercial standardized measurement-to-monetization
    system for determining Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE)) and its components (SoS and
    GMP).

More Notes:
  1: The study includes a case study using data from a tropical forest in Ghana and
    a deciduous forest in Massachusetts, USA.
  5: The paper assumes loss of carbon due to fire, UV, removal of biomass, and import
    of biomass is negligible for the project sites.
  6: The flowchart (Panel B) illustrates a process for managing and validating carbon
    emissions and sequestration for trading carbon credits, involving a data center,
    registry, third-party validation, and a pooled portfolio.
  8: The page provides background information on the Ankasa Park site, including its
    location, management history, forest composition, genetic heat index, and population
    trends in the surrounding district.
  17: NEE provides a quantitative record of daily and annual carbon sequestration.
  18: The presented cash flow values are illustrations and do not represent actual
    carbon products or cash flow. The study emphasizes the importance of establishing
    new and sustained NEE observation platforms for characterizing annual NEE trends.
  19: The analysis differentiates between estimation-based protocols and observation
    of CO2 assimilation via photosynthesis or efflux via respiration.
  21: Long-term CO2 measurement is critical for determining variance in annual changes
    of NEE and creating corresponding annual forest carbon financial products.
  22: "This page argues that existing estimation protocols (e.g., CARB, CAR, CDM,\
    \ ACR, VERRA) introduce fundamental uncertainties in NEE, rendering the basis\
    \ for reporting gC m\u22122 yr\u22121 for NEE as problematic and unverifiable."
  24: The paper suggests that traditional protocols are overly cumbersome and lengthy
    to establish offset transactions, and financially inviable to compete with the
    short time intervals of deforestation.

    \ was -10.2 tCO2 acre-1 yr-1 \xB13.6 (SD). HF 2010 NEE showed a reversal of +4.79\
    \ tCO2eq relative to 2009."
  17: The AP NEE slope is -8.40, 1.7 times that of the HF slope. Harvard Forest's
    trend line equation is y = -8.3987x + 16874.7. Ankasa Park's trend line equation
    is y = -4.9185x + 804.74.

    Total pre-tax cash flow for Case 2 (mixed carbon product types) is $16,380,000
    and $7,610,000 for the Harvard Forest and Ankasa Park sites, respectively. The
    hypothetical carbon products range in price from $12 tCO2eq for compliance offsets
    to $50 tCO2eq for carbon products with the additional element of biodiversity.
