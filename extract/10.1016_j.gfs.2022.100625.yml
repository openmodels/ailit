Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate-related hazards (droughts, forest fires, floods, extreme rainfall, landslides,
    cyclones, extreme temperatures, sea level rise)
  2: Climate-related hazards such as droughts, floods, cyclones, landslides, extreme
    temperatures, and sea-level rise impacting Indian food supply.
  4: Droughts, cyclones, extreme rainfall, extreme temperature, forest fire, flood,
    landslide, and sea-level rise are identified as climate hazards.
  5: Climate hazards impacting domestic food production and interstate trade, and
    the reliance on food imports from other states.
Highlights:
  1: Climate hazard risks to food supply vary across states and by hazard type. Largest
    climate hazard risks to state food supply are in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Assam.
    For 14 states, the climate hazard risk is greater for imported food supply than
    for locally produced supply. Five states contribute to more than half of the climate
    hazard risk in interstate food trade.
  2: India's food supply is vulnerable to climate hazards with 82% of the population
    exposed to at least one hazard, impacting national food security.
  4: Droughts pose a greater risk to Indian food supply than other climate hazards,
    while landslides and sea-level rise pose the lowest risk. Risk patterns vary across
    states and climate hazards.
  5: Northern and central Indian states face high climate hazard risk to per capita
    food supply. The percentage of risk due to imports varies across states, with
    western and southern regions showing mid-range risks. Interstate trade of food
    contributes to climate hazard risk of food supply.
Methodology:
  1: Risk assessment using historical climatological and geological data, supply and
    demand balance model to estimate source of food supply.
  2: State-level climate hazard presence data from 2000 combined with food production
    and interstate trade data to quantify food supply risk.
  4: The study quantifies climate hazard risk to food supply by considering risks
    at the food supply source in Indian states from 2000-2020.
  5: Maps and chord diagrams are used to visualize climate hazard risk to food supply
    and interstate trade; chord diagram created with circlize package in R.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on food security and supply chains within India, assessing
    the impact of climate hazards on both local production and interstate trade of
    food items.
  4: The analysis focuses on the impact of climate hazards on food supply within India,
    differentiating between locally produced and imported food. The identification
    of key exporting states and number of importing states is included.
  5: The analysis identifies regional vulnerabilities in food supply chains related
    to climate hazards.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Adverse effects on national food supply, affecting both local production and
    interstate trade.
  4: Climate hazards pose a risk to food supply in Indian states, which can impact
    the per capita food supply that is produced locally or imported.
  5: Climate hazard risk to per capita food supply.
Quantitative material:
  1: Risks were estimated using the most recent data available on hazard presence,
    vulnerability, and volume of per capita food supply that is exposed to hazards
    (2000-2020). Supply and demand balance model for 30 major food items using government
    data from 2011-12.
  4: Figures 1 and 2 visually represent percentage land area affected by climate hazards
    and climate hazard risk to per capita food supply, respectively. The paper quantifies
    climate hazard risk to food supply, with droughts presenting a greater risk than
    landslides and sea-level rise.
  5: Climate hazard risk to per capita food supply is categorized into quartiles (low
    to high). Percentage of risk attributable to imports from other states.
