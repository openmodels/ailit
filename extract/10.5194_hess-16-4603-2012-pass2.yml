  5: No relevant information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change altering monsoon patterns and increasing temperatures in the Mekong
    basin, and the operation of existing and planned hydropower reservoirs.
  6: Future changes in Mekong River hydrology
Highlights:
  1: "Reservoir operation is likely to have a larger impact on the Mekong hydrograph\
    \ than climate change, particularly during the dry season, within the next 20\u2013\
    30 years; climate change increases the uncertainty of the estimated reservoir\
    \ operation impacts."
  6: Model agreement is better at downstream stations than at upstream stations during
    the calibration period; The model somewhat underestimates dry season flows in
    the upper part of the catchment; The best agreement between the modelled and observed
    data is for Pakse and Stung Treng; Agreement during the validation period is slightly
    worse for upstream stations but somewhat better for other stations.
Methodology:
  1: Downscaled output of five general circulation models (GCMs); used an optimisation
    approach to estimate the operation of multiple reservoirs; used a distributed
    hydrological model, VMod, with a grid resolution of 5km x 5km.
  6: Hydrological model calibration and validation using measured discharge data;
    Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient used to evaluate model performance; Calibration
    period focused on matching model to Stung Treng gauging station, with Chiang Saen
    used for upper basin parameter calibration; Validation period used previously
    calibrated parameters.
More Notes:
  6: The model uses a leaf area index (LAI) that varies based on temperature and water
    availability.
No relevant information:
  7: No macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, or costs/benefits of adaptation at a national
    level, are discussed on this page. The focus is on hydrological modelling of the
    Mekong River.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Potential impacts on the multibillion-dollar Mekong fisheries.

Quantitative material:
  1: "Simulated change in discharge at Kratie (Cambodia) between the baseline (1982\u2013\
    1992) and projected time period (2032\u20132042) ranges from \u2212 11% to + 15%\
    \ for the wet season and \u2212 10% to + 13% for the dry season due to climate\
    \ change; reservoir operations result in 25\u2013160% higher dry season flows\
    \ and 5\u201324% lower flood peaks in Kratie."
