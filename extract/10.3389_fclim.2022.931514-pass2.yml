Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate variability and change, specifically increased climate variability, weather
    extremes such as floods and droughts, rainfall shortages or excesses, and variability
    in rainfall and temperature, all impacting the agriculture sector.
  2: Climate change impacts, such as droughts and changes in seasonality, affecting
    agriculture productivity and food security in Ethiopia.

Highlights:
  1: Climate services can contribute to the alleviation of a range of climate-sensitive
    development challenges, including agricultural production and food security. The
    ACToday project aims to develop climate service solutions through enhancement
    of the availability and effectiveness of climate information in national policy,
    planning, management, and other decision-making processes.
  2: High-quality climate information needs to be accessible, timely, and relevant
    to effectively aid adaptation; ACToday project's approach intends to improve the
    use of climate data in decision-making.

Methodology:
  1: The paper shares experiences from the implementation of the ACToday project in
    Ethiopia, outlining its accomplishments and challenges to determine best practices
    and pitfalls. It provides guidance to ensure climate research evolves into services
    appropriately and responsibly.
  2: Discussion on the efficacy of climate information in decision-making processes,
    exemplified through the ACToday project, highlighting the need for integrated
    and user-relevant climate information services.

More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the agriculture sector in Ethiopia, where 85% of the population
    depends on agriculture for its livelihoods.
  2: The disconnect between available climate information and actual usage in decision-making
    processes is emphasized, with solutions offered through case studies of climate
    information integration.
  9: This page focuses on climate information services and capacity building in Ethiopia,
    particularly related to rainfall forecasting. It does not directly quantify macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes of climate change or adaptation. Instead, it describes the
    development and implementation of tools and training programs to improve agricultural
    decision-making based on climate forecasts. While improved agricultural decisions
    could indirectly influence macroeconomic variables, this paper does not provide
    specific estimates of those effects.
  10: The text focuses on capacity building and the development of climate services
    in Ethiopia, especially within the agricultural sector. It highlights the National
    Framework for Climate Services (NFCS) as an institutional mechanism and describes
    climate risk management training programs. The graphic illustrates various groups
    targeted with climate risk management curricula and their implementation timelines.
    It does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, costs, or
    benefits of adaptation at a national level.
