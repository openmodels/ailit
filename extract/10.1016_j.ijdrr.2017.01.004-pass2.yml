Drivers of Risk:
  1: Disasters
  3: Increasing frequency and severity of disasters in Australia.
  5: Natural disasters
  7: Weather-related disasters.
  8: Changes in number and value of dwellings, as well as building regulations.
  9: Natural disasters such as floods, severe storms, and cyclones are mentioned as
    drivers of economic costs.
  10: Natural disasters
  11: Severe storms, floods, cyclones, bushfires, and heatwaves.
  12: Tropical cyclones, floods, bushfires, storms, and earthquakes.
  13: Tropical cyclones accounted for one third of building damage in Australia.
  16: Natural disasters.
  18: Natural disasters (insured and uninsured).
  19: Natural disasters (drought, floods, etc.)
  21: There may be an increase in the number of large disasters, possibly influenced
    by better reporting and disaster knowledge.
  22: Tropical cyclones, severe storms, floods, hailstorms, bushfires, and earthquakes.
  24: Severe storms, floods, tropical cyclones, bushfires, earthquakes, and landslides.
  27: Severe storms, bushfires, and tropical cyclones, with geographic variation across
    Australian states.
  30: Bushfires, and by extension, climate change as an exacerbating factor.
  31: Disasters such as cyclones, bushfires, earthquakes, and floods.
Highlights:
  3: There is no single answer to the question of how much disasters cost Australia;
    there is a confounding variety of estimates relating to the cost of weather-related
    disasters; interpretation of costs can vary depending on what is included and
    whether it's interpreted as a loss or benefit; existing estimates may not consider
    the impacts of climate change, or indirect/intangible damages.
  5: Major difficulties in providing a full economic analysis stems from a lack of
    data, poor data quality, lack of precise definition of cost categories, vague
    or variable temporal and geographical limitations, limited loss indicators, irregular
    frequency of updates and a lack of reliability assessment.
  7: Cost categories captured in the data is a significant factor influencing conclusions;
    Insurance industry data underlies several analyses, accounting for a subset of
    direct costs only.
  8: No observable trends in disaster losses over time, once building number, value
    and standards have been accounted for.
  9: Floods, severe storms, and cyclones account for the majority of disaster costs;
    bushfires have significant impact on human life.
  10: Handmer, Ladds and Magee 2015 report (BTE update) provides the most comprehensive
    and up-to-date assessment of total economic loss from disasters in Australia.
  11: Severe storms and floods are the most costly types of disaster; heatwaves are
    underestimated in previous estimates and account for 50% of all deaths; Queensland
    and New South Wales make up the majority of disaster costs in Australia.
  12: Tropical cyclones and floods are major contributors to fatalities. Meteorological
    hazards are the main drivers of building damage since 1900.  Heatwave deaths are
    not included despite being responsible for more deaths than all other natural
    hazards combined (Risk Frontiers).
  13: The Risk Frontiers database highlights the novel use of a building damage index
    reducing building damage to housing equivalents.
  16: Australia is among the top 10 countries globally for the number of disasters
    and bushfires are the most expensive disaster globally.
  18: Different databases for recording natural disasters in Australia and internationally
    have significant discrepancies in the frequency and severity of disasters reported.
  19: Disaster loss estimates vary significantly depending on the data source and
    collection methodology.
  22: The ranking of disasters varies depending on the metric used (normalised insured
    losses vs. normalised total losses) and comprehensiveness of analysis. Earlier
    disasters without comprehensive analysis may appear less costly.
  24: Severe storms, floods, and tropical cyclones are the most costly disasters in
    Australia, while bushfires, earthquakes, and landslides are the least costly.
    Over 50% of deaths between 1967 and 2013 were caused by heatwaves.
  27: Data and methodology can lead to profoundly different estimates of the loss
    associated with the same event (Ash Wednesday bushfires).
  30: Economic estimates of disaster costs in Australia are wide-ranging due to limitations
    in data availability, quality, and reporting. Insurance data is often used as
    a proxy but represents only a portion of total losses.
  31: Disaster costs are not increasing over time, while the number of disasters tends
    to be increasing over time. New South Wales and Queensland have the highest costs
    and number of disasters of Australian states.
Methodology:
  1: Comparison of disaster cost estimates
  3: Compares different approaches to costing natural disasters in Australia.
  5: Disaster cost estimates are largely drawn from insurance data with some augmentation,
    though this has limitations.
  6: Highlights the common limitation of using different normalisation methods and
    assumptions, which can significantly influence trend analysis results.
  7: Comparison of four domestic reports and one international report on economic
    losses from weather-related disasters; Data are adjusted to 2013 dollars for comparison.
  8: Normalises losses to estimate what they would be under 2011 conditions, controls
    for changes in number and value of dwellings, as well as building regulations.
  9: Data was drawn from the Emergency Management Australia database (now EM Knowledge
    Hub) and adjusted for inflation but not for changes in wealth or population.
  10: 'Database (AUS-DIS) prepared for the examination of economic costs of natural
    disasters in Australia from 1967 until 2013. Cost categories are: insured loss,
    estimated total loss and the value of loss of life and injury. The database includes
    a reliability analysis of the data sources.'
  12: Analysis uses the Risk Frontiers database. Building damage is converted to house
    equivalents (HE) based on floor areas and per m2 construction costs.
  13: The Risk Frontiers database uses data collection from multiple sources including
    newspaper reports, with a focus on structural assets. The database spans from
    1788 to present but has limitations in underestimation of building damage and
    incomplete records.
  16: Time series analysis of disaster losses in Australia, analysis of losses by
    state and disaster type.
  22: The paper compares top ten loss events using different metrics (normalised insured
    losses, normalised total losses, and house equivalent losses) from three different
    reports (Handmer, Ladds and Magee; Crompton; and Blong). Normalisation is used
    to compare events across different years.
  27: Comparison of loss estimates from different databases and reports (ICA, EM Knowledge
    Hub, BTE report) for the same event (Ash Wednesday bushfires) to highlight the
    impact of data and methodology on loss estimation.
  30: Estimates are based on various sources including insurance data, full economic
    impact assessments, legislative assembly ministerial statements, and reinsurance
    company data. Values adjusted for inflation using http://www.rba.gov.au/calculator/.
More Notes:
  1: This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication.
    The manuscript will undergo copyediting, typesetting, and review of the resulting
    galley proof before it is published in its final citable form. Errors may be discovered
    during the production process which could affect the content.
  3: Highlights the need for consistent and comparable data collection and analysis
    to respond to increasing frequency and severity of disasters.
  5: Insurance data represents only a fraction of the total cost of a disaster due
    to underinsurance and limited coverage for certain sectors. Indirect and intangible
    costs are often not captured by insurance data.
  6: The paper emphasizes that the choice of normalisation method can significantly
    influence the results of trend analysis, particularly in countries with rising
    populations and expanding economies like Australia. This suggests that the perceived
    impact of climate change on disaster losses is heavily influenced by how the data
    is adjusted for socio-economic factors.
  7: The reports differ in ways too significant to allow for their results to be directly
    measured against each other at the level of individual events; Accuracy of historical
    damage cost estimates and corrective variables is assumed in the normalization
    process.
  8: Study is limited by relying on household insurance data, omitting hazards not
    covered by insurance, uninsured/under-insured people, and uninsured assets/impacts.
  9: The EM Knowledge Hub database is used extensively because it is freely available
    and includes a comprehensive range of cost and human loss data.
  11: The AUS-DIS database attempts to address the limitations of the BTE (2001) report
    by including direct, indirect, and intangible losses from 1967-2013; events must
    cost over $10 million (normalized to 2013 dollars) or result in three or more
    lives lost to be included.
  12: Blong's analysis does not enumerate the cost of disasters to Australia in dollars.
  16: The paper highlights challenges in comparing disaster loss data due to different
    collection methods and definitions. The ICA database began recording historical
    data losses in 1967. Number of disasters impacts trends over time, if the number
    of disasters cannot be agreed upon, agreement on costs is unlikely.
  18: The study highlights the limitations of disaster databases and the need for
    streamlined disaster recording to improve comparability.
  19: The paper suggests that ICA significantly underestimates the total economic
    cost of disasters in Australia.
  21: The analysis highlights the differing cost estimates of disasters based on data
    sources and methodologies.
  22: The image is a placeholder for an "Accepted Manuscript," indicating the document
    is not yet published.
  27: The focus is on individual event loss assessment, particularly the 1983 Ash
    Wednesday bushfires. The ICA database estimates losses in both Victoria and South
    Australia, representing insured losses only.
  30: The paper acknowledges limitations in estimating the full economic costs of
    disasters due to data issues (availability, quality, temporal and geographical
    limitations, lack of regularity of updating, and little or no reliability analysis).
