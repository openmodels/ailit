Drivers of Risk:
  1: climate change, CO2 emissions, temperature, rainfall
  2: Climate change (temperature, precipitation, sunshine duration); CO2 emissions;
    rapid urbanization; land degradation; energy consumption; mining.
  3: Changes in mean temperature and rainfall leading to stronger droughts; Climate
    change impacts making agricultural productivity more vulnerable
  4: Climate change factors (CO2 level, average annual temperature, and rainfall).
  6: Climate change indicators (temperature)
  7: Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, average annual temperature, rainfall, primary energy
    consumption per capita, total fertilizers by nutrients used in agricultural sector
    (X).
  8: Climate change indicators, specifically CO2 emissions, temperature, and rainfall,
    impacting agricultural productivity.
  10: Not explicitly stated, but the analysis implies a long-run relationship between
    lnAGR and other unspecified variables, potentially affected by climate change
    (though not explicitly stated here)
  11: CO2 emission level, temperature level, rainfall
  12: "CO2 emissions (lnCO2, \u2206lnCO2), Temperature (lnTEMP, \u2206lnTEMP), Rainfall\
    \ (lnRF, \u2206lnRF), Energy Consumption (lnEC, \u2206lnEC), Fossil Energy (lnFE,\
    \ \u2206lnFE)"
  13: Climate change, specifically temperature, rainfall, and CO2 concentration; land
    degradation
  21: Climate change, technical progress
Highlights:
  2: CO2 emissions could be linked to agricultural productivity in the short-term.
    The short-term effect of CO2 emissions is positive, turning negative in the long
    term, suggesting carbon fertilization initially benefits agricultural productivity.
  3: Climate change makes agricultural productivity more vulnerable, particularly
    in developing countries like those in Sub-Saharan Africa, South-eastern Asia,
    and Western Asia.
  4: Analyzes the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity for selected
    Asian countries with a focus on short and long-run impacts of climate variables.
  9: The results indicate mixed non-stationarity of variables at levels, but all variables
    are stationary at first differences, indicating integration of order one (I(1)).
  10: There is a long-run relationship (cointegration) between lnAGR and other variables
    in the model.
  11: CO2 emissions and temperature have a significant negative impact on agricultural
    productivity in the long run. Rainfall has a significant positive impact.
  12: In the short-run, the coefficients of the impact of CO2 emissions and energy
    consumption are significant at 1% level. However, the significant effects are
    observed in opposite directions in comparison with the long-term for both CO2
    emission and energy consumption.
  13: There is a long-term relationship between agricultural productivity and climate
    change variables; CO2 emissions are linked to agricultural productivity in the
    short-term (positive effect), but carbon emissions and annual temperature have
    an adverse effect on agricultural productivity in the long-run.
Methodology:
  1: heterogeneous panel data approach
  2: "The study investigates the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity\
    \ in the short-run and long-run in Asia over the period of 1980\u20132016, finding\

    sector as control variables.

    long-run and short-run effects of climate-related variables (CO2 emissions, temperature,
    rainfall) and energy-related variables (energy consumption, fossil energy) on
    agricultural productivity. The Hausman test is used to compare the PMG and MG
    estimators. The data covers 11 countries and 396 observations.
