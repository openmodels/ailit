Drivers of Risk:
  1: Restrictions on agricultural trade, climate change impacts on crop yields, cereal
    import dependency constraints.
  2: The consequences of reduced international trade and the impacts of climate change
    on cereal production.
  4: Constrained cereal trade and climate change impacts on crop yields are considered.
    The climate change impacts are based on the Hadley Centre Global Environmental
    Model [HadGEM] under RCP8.5.
  5: Constrained cereal trade and climate change impacts on crop yield.
  6: Climate change negatively impacts yields.
  7: Climate change impacts, constrained cereal trade due to global trade restrictions,
    regional differences in income levels.
  10: Climate change impacts on crop yields and constrained cereal trade (import dependency)
    drive regional corn price changes.
  11: Constrained cereal trade and climate change impacts.
  12: Climate change impacts, Constrained cereal trade
  13: Constrained cereal trade, climate change impacts on crop yields, import dependency
    constraints.
  14: Climate change impacts on crop yields, and constrained cereal trade (global
    cereal import dependency constraints).
  15: Shocks impacting the outcomes include changes in trade patterns, climate change,
    domestic shocks like drought or floods, and supply chain disruptions.
Highlights:
  1: Most regions experience larger changes in cereal consumption due to cereal import
    dependency constraints than due to the impacts of climate change on agricultural
    yields. Climate change results in rising domestic prices and declining consumption
    of cereal crops. Trade perturbations and climate change vary greatly across regions.
  2: The impact of reduced international trade on production and consumption of cereals
    is stronger than climate change in most regions, with zero cereal import dependency
    strategy leading to decreases in global cereal production and consumption.
  4: The study analyzes the spatial pattern of model outcomes under global zero cereal
    import dependency and associated economic changes for producers and consumers
    in each region.
  5: Global trade of cereals decreases under scenarios with import dependency constraints.
    Climate change impacts on agricultural yields have a very small impact on global
    total cereal import quantity relative to the effects of import dependency.
  6: Climate change and import dependency constraints have a significant, additive
    negative impact on global cereal consumption.
  7: Global trade restrictions (ID scenario) lead to decreased cereal exports from
    major exporters (USA, Brazil) and decreased imports to major importers (Middle
    East, Western Africa) compared to the Reference scenario (RF). Regions that are
    cereal importers in RF must increase cereal production in ID, leading to increased
    prices and decreased consumption. Climate change has a small effect on CIDR.
  10: Constrained cereal trade leads to higher domestic prices in high-importing regions;
    climate change and trade dependency each significantly increase prices in certain
    regions like the Middle East.
  11: Constrained cereal trade and climate change significantly reduce cereal production
    and exports in the US, leading to substantial decreases in net trade revenue.
    Climate change also impacts irrigation water consumption.
  12: Constrained cereal trade leads to decreased cereal consumption and increased
    non-cereal consumption in the Middle East. Climate change generally increases
    yields for non-cereal crops in the Middle East, leading to increased production
    and consumption, and decreased imports.
  13: Climate change and constrained trade have significant impacts on trade revenue,
    food expenditure, and water consumption, with the magnitude and direction of the
    impacts varying across regions (USA vs Middle East) and scenarios (ID, CC, IC).
    The Middle East experiences decreased caloric intake and increased food expenditure
    share of income, while the USA sees changes in trade revenue and irrigation water
    consumption.
  14: In the Middle East, constrained trade leads to a near complete elimination of
    corn ethanol production due to regional scarcity of cereal crops and more elastic
    demand for ethanol than food. In the USA, constrained trade increases corn ethanol
    production due to decreased global demand for corn.
  15: Key outcomes include the reduction of global cereal trade by half due to import
    dependency constraints, the amplification of impacts by climate change, and the
    increased susceptibility to domestic shocks.
Methodology:
  1: Systematic perturbations in two dimensions (agricultural trade restrictions and
    climate impacts on crop yields) are introduced and explored independently and
    in combination using long-term projections.
  2: Systematic perturbations to a global integrated human-Earth system model, using
    the Global Change Analysis Model [GCAM v5.3], focusing on cereal import dependency
    constraints and climate change impacts on crop yields from 2015 to 2050.
  4: The study uses the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) with a cereal import
    constraint, which forces each region to satisfy its cereal needs from domestic
    production. A cereal production credit is introduced, creating a subsidy for domestic
    cereal producers to encourage domestic production to meet domestic consumption.
    Climate change impacts on crop yields are incorporated into GCAM as a multiplier
    to the baseline yield, based on outputs from the Hadley Centre Global Environmental
    Model processed through Persephone, emulating crop yield changes based on yield
    response sensitivities seen in the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement
    Project [AgMIP].
  5: The study uses the GCAM model to explore the multi-sector dynamics of agriculture,
    bioenergy, and water systems under different scenarios, including a global zero
    cereal import dependency constraint and climate change impacts on crop yields.
    Scenarios run up to 2050 in 5-year time steps.
  7: 'The study uses four model scenarios (RF, ID, CC, IC) to project changes in cereal
    trade, production, and consumption until 2050. Regional differences are explored
    by selecting four representative regions: USA, Brazil, Middle East, and Western
    Africa.'
  10: The analysis uses a model projecting regional corn prices under different scenarios,
    including climate change impacts and import dependency constraints, until 2050
    in 5 year time steps.
  11: The analysis uses a global economy-wide model (GCAM) to simulate the effects
    of constrained cereal trade and climate change. Results are applicable to the
    year 2050, focusing on the United States.
  12: 'The paper uses a model to project agricultural outcomes in 2050 under different
    scenarios: RF (Reference), CC (Climate Change), and IC (Constrained Cereal Trade).
    The analysis focuses on the Middle East.'
  13: 'The paper analyzes the combined effects of changes in quantity and price of
    cereals on trade revenue, producer''s revenue, consumer''s food expenditure, caloric
    consumption, and water consumption under different scenarios: ID (induced drought),
    CC (climate change), and IC (combined impacts), relative to a reference case (RF).  The
    analysis considers net importers vs. exporters and how crop yields are affected
    by climate change.'
  14: The study evaluates the individual and combined impacts of climate change and
    trade constraints on multiple sectoral outcomes through 2050 using a global economic
    model. It analyzes one realization of climate change impacts and one alternative
    trade perturbation scenario.
  15: The analysis involves altering trade patterns and assessing the combined implications
    of trade perturbations and climate change on various sectors, though specific
    methodologies are not detailed on this page.

Quantitative material:
  1: Global trade of cereals decreases ~50% in 2050 compared to the baseline with
    zero import dependency; cereal production and consumption decrease 4%; global
    irrigation water consumption increases 3%; corn ethanol production decreases 7%
    in 2050.
  4: Cereal import dependency ratio is defined as (cereal imports - cereal exports)
    / (cereal production + cereal imports - cereal exports) = net cereal imports /
    cereal consumption = 1 - (cereal production / cereal consumption).
  5: Total cereal production and consumption decrease only 3.1%-4.1% over the 2025-2050
    period under import dependency constraint scenarios.
  6: The import dependency constraint decreases global land allocated to cereal crops
    by 3.6% on average.
  7: Figure 2 shows global total import, consumption, and land allocation of cereals
    over 2015-2050 under four model scenarios (RF, ID, CC, IC). Figure 3 shows regional
    changes in cereal imports and exports in 2050 in ID compared to RF. Figure 4 shows
    regional production and consumption patterns. CIDR (Comparative Import Disadvantage
    Ratio) is reported for USA, Brazil, Middle East, and Western Africa.
  10: The image shows regional corn prices (in 2015 $/kg) from 2015-2050 in the USA,
    Brazil, Middle East, and Western Africa under different scenarios (RF, ID, CC,
    IC).
  11: 'Table 1 presents quantitative results for the USA in 2050 under different scenarios
    (RF, ID, CC, IC) including: cereal and non-cereal production (Mt), consumption
    (Mt), exports (Mt), imports (Mt), net trade revenue (billion 2015$), crop producer''s
    revenue (billion 2015$), caloric consumption (Kcal/cap/day), food expenditure
    as a share of GDP (%), irrigation water consumption (km3), and ethanol production
    (EJ).'
  12: Quantitative projections for 2050 for various agricultural variables in the
    Middle East under different scenarios, including changes in production, consumption,
    exports, imports, and revenue for cereals and non-cereals.
  13: USA experiences a decrease in net export revenue from cereals in ID (induced
    drought), while increasing export revenue from non-cereal crops. Net effect of
    ID on total crop export revenue in the USA is negative, resulting in a roughly
    50% loss relative to RF (reference case). In CC (climate change), trade revenue
    decreases for both cereal and non-cereal crops in the USA, but the total loss
    is smaller (roughly 30%) than in ID. In IC (combined impacts), the combined effects
    in the USA are large, with a loss in trade revenue of nearly 75%. Middle East
    shows a 94% reduction in cereal net import expenditures in ID. Total reduction
    in crop trade expenditures in the Middle East is 42% in ID. Middle East has reductions
    in total calories in CC. USA irrigation water consumption decreases roughly 8%,
    while in the Middle East it increases 21% due to import dependency constraints
    (in ID). USA cereal producer revenue decreases by 18% in ID. USA total caloric
    consumption increases slightly in ID, but decreases in CC and IC. Cereal caloric
    consumption offset by other staple foods for a net zero change in staple consumption.
  14: Corn ethanol production change in the Middle East and USA under climate change
    are -14% and -18%, respectively. Corn ethanol production change in the Middle
    East and USA under import dependency are -96% and +11%, respectively.
