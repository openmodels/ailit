Highlights:
  1: Most regions experience larger changes in cereal consumption due to cereal import
    dependency constraints than due to the impacts of climate change on agricultural
    yields. Climate change results in rising domestic prices and declining consumption
    of cereal crops.
  4: The study analyzes the spatial pattern of model outcomes (e.g., crop land allocation,
    crop production, global trade, and consumption) under the influence of global
    zero cereal import dependency and the associated economic changes. It also explores
    implications for irrigation water consumption and crop-based ethanol production.
  5: Despite large decreases in cereal trade, total cereal production and consumption
    decrease only 3.1%-4.1% from 2025-2050, with climate change accelerating this
    trend.
  6: Climate change and import dependency constraints lead to decreases in global
    cereal consumption. The combined impact is roughly additive. Climate change impacts
    on yields are negative, leading to increased land allocation for cereal crops
    to compensate. Import dependency constraints alone decrease the land allocated
    to cereal crops.
  7: Regions that are major cereal exporters (USA, Brazil, Argentina, Australia_NZ)
    show the largest decrease in cereal export under trade restrictions (ID scenario).
    Major cereal importers (Middle East, Northern and Western Africa) show the largest
    decrease in cereal import under the ID scenario. Cereal importers increase cereal
    production in ID scenario and exporters decrease production.
  8: Trade perturbations generally have a larger impact than climate change on cereal
    production and consumption, except for the USA where changes are comparable.
  9: Changes in cereal production and consumption vary by region; dependency on cereal
    imports affects domestic decisions under future scenarios.
  11: Constrained cereal trade and climate change significantly impact cereal production,
    trade revenue, and water consumption in the USA by 2050. There are also impacts
    to other crops and ethanol production.
  12: Key outcomes include significant changes such as a 78.6% decrease in cereal
    imports and a 2639% increase in cereal exports for the Middle East.
  13: Constrained cereal trade and climate change significantly impact trade revenue,
    producer revenue, consumer food expenditure, caloric consumption and water resources,
    with varying effects on the USA and the Middle East depending on whether they
    are net importers or exporters. The USA experiences losses in cereal export revenue
    and producer revenue under constrained trade, while the Middle East experiences
    reductions in cereal import expenditures. Water consumption shifts, with decreased
    irrigation in the USA and increased irrigation in the Middle East.
  14: In the Middle East, trade can mitigate some negative climate change impacts
    on crop yields; irrigation water consumption changes are smaller with climate
    change than with trade restrictions. In the USA, climate change leads to a larger
    increase in irrigation water for non-cereal crops compared to the decrease from
    trade restrictions. Trade constraints lead to a near complete elimination of corn
    ethanol production in the Middle East. Cereal net importers reduce corn ethanol
    production with trade constraints, while net exporters increase production.
  15: Reducing import dependency could lower sensitivity to international supply chain
    fluctuations but increase susceptibility to domestic shocks; there are potential
    negative impacts on economic well-being, such as trade and producer revenues.
Methodology:
  1: Systematic perturbations in two dimensions (agricultural trade restrictions and
    climate impacts on crop yields) are introduced to explore the interaction of agricultural-bioenergy-water
    systems under the broader economy using long-term projections.
  3: Uses a modified version of GCAM (Global Change Assessment Model) version 5.3,
    an open-source, global-scale integrated assessment model. It is a market equilibrium
    model that captures economic decisions and dynamic interactions between multiple
    systems, operating at 32 geopolitical regions and 235 water basins. The model
    calibration periods span from 1975 to 2015. A net-zero cereal import requirement
    is enforced in GCAM by modifying the cereal import dependency ratio.
  4: The analysis is performed using the GCAM model. The cereal import constraint
    is enforced by introducing a cereal production credit system. Climate change impacts
    on crop yields are estimated using the Persephone model, which emulates crop yield
    changes based on yield response sensitivities seen in the Agricultural Model Intercomparison
    and Improvement Project [AgMIP]. The corresponding harvest area for each crop
    is endogenously decided in GCAM using a nested logit architecture in the land-use
    sector. The climate change scenario used is RCP8.5.
  5: The analysis uses four scenarios within the GCAM model, solving for markets so
    supply and demand are balanced, to explore changes from 2015 to 2050.
  6: The analysis uses the GCAM model. The base year for the model is 2015, and results
    are presented for 2050. The analysis considers scenarios with climate change (CC),
    import dependency constraint (ID), and their combined impact (IC), relative to
    a reference scenario (RF).
  7: The analysis uses four model scenarios (RF, ID, CC, IC) to project changes from
    2015-2050 in 5-year time steps. The analysis focuses on regional differences by
    evaluating USA, Brazil, Middle East, and Western Africa.
  8: The analysis compares import and export quantities under different scenarios
    and the impact of climate change and trade perturbations on cereal production
    and consumption.
  9: Analysis examines cereal trade and climate change impacts on cereal import dependency
    and various related factors in 2050.
  11: The analysis uses a model (GCAM) to project outcomes in 2050 under different
    scenarios (RF, ID, CC, IC) related to climate change and trade constraints.
  13: The analysis compares different scenarios (RF, ID, CC, IC) to assess the impacts
    on trade, production, consumption, and water use.
  14: The study analyzes the individual and combined impacts of climate change and
    trade constraints on multiple sectoral outcomes through 2050, using one realization
    of climate change impacts and one alternative trade perturbation scenario.
More Notes:
  1: The individual and interactive effects of trade perturbations and climate change
    vary greatly across regions, which are also affected by the regional ability to
    increase agricultural production through intensification or extensification.
  3: The paper acknowledges the extreme nature of the zero cereal import dependency
    constraint and emphasizes that the objective is to understand linkages in the
    coupled systems rather than specific policy analysis.
  6: The import dependency ratio (CIDR) is used to quantify the reliance on cereal
    imports. The map (Fig 1a) illustrates CIDR across GCAM regions in 2015.
  8: Trade changes are visualized using a circular chord diagram illustrating import/export
    changes among regions using colored chords.
  9: No additional notes from this page.
  11: The paper also examines the sugarcane ethanol production in Brazil, although
    the US relies on corn based ethanol production.
  15: The paper suggests that import dependency constraints and climate change may
    have a compounded effect on agricultural systems.
Quantitative material:
  1: Global trade of cereals decreases ~50% in 2050 compared to the baseline with
    import dependency ratio of zero; cereal production and consumption decreases by
    4%; global irrigation water consumption increases 3%; corn ethanol production
    decreases 7% in 2050.
  3: The model projects out to 2100 in 5-year time steps.
  5: Relative to the RF scenario, total cereal imports in scenarios ID and IC decrease
    nearly by half in 2025, with further decreases in later periods.
  6: Global cereal consumption decrease in 2050 due to climate change is about 3.5%
    compared to a reference scenario. Combined impact of import dependency constraint
    and climate change on global cereal consumption is roughly a 7.5% decrease. Import
    dependency constraint decreases global land allocated to cereal crops by 3.6%
    on average.
  7: 'CIDR changes are quantified: In 2050, the CIDR is 2 percentage points higher
    in CC than RF for USA and Western Africa, with minimal changes for Brazil and
    Middle East.'
  8: The USA shows a -12% change in cereal production and a +9% change in consumption
    due to trade perturbations in ID scenario for 2050.
  9: Fig. 4 shows percent change in cereal production versus consumption in 2050,
    comparing different scenarios (ID, CC, IC) to RF.
  11: The table provides quantitative results for various key variables in 2050 for
    the USA, including percent changes compared to a reference case (RF). Examples
    include changes in cereal production (-11.8% to -20.4%), non-cereal production
    (-0.6% to -2.3%), cereal consumption (8.9% to -9.0%), and net trade revenue for
    cereals (-94.5% to -11.2%).
  12: The table offers quantitative data including percent changes in cereal and non-cereal
    production, imports, exports, and other key variables in 2050.
  13: Net export revenue from cereals in the USA decreases under the ID scenario,
    with an approximate 50% loss in total crop export revenue relative to the reference
    scenario (RF). In the CC scenario, total crop export revenue loss for the USA
    is roughly 30%. The combined effects in IC are a trade revenue loss of nearly
    75%. The Middle East experiences a 94% reduction in cereal net import expenditures
    in ID, partially offset by increased non-cereal trade expenditures, resulting
    in a total reduction in crop trade expenditures of 42%. The effects of import
    dependency constraints on USA cereal producer revenue are -18%, while trade revenue
    is -94%. Irrigation water consumption decreases by roughly 8% in the USA and increases
    by 21% in the Middle East due to cereal import dependency constraints. Staple
    caloric consumption changes are less than 0.5% for both regions and all scenarios.
  14: Cereal crop consumption decreases, while non-cereal crop consumption increases
    in the USA and Brazil. In the Middle East and USA, corn ethanol production changes
    by -14% and -18% respectively under climate change, but changes by 96% and 11%
    with trade constraints.
  15: Global trade quantity of cereals decreases to almost half under global zero
    cereal import dependency, while in the Middle East, irrigation water consumption
    increases by 21% due to import dependency constraints and climate change.
