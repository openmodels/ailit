Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change
  4: Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and temperature.
  5: Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, rising temperatures, and adverse weather
    are impacting food security.
  6: Changes in atmospheric CO2 and temperature are the drivers of risk for crop yields.
  7: Projected changes in atmospheric CO2 and temperature
  9: Changes in average temperature are shown as a driver of risk.
  11: Minimum and maximum temperatures, precipitation, CO2, climate change
  12: Temperature, CO2, technological advances, and other adaptations
  13: "Temperature in \xB0C and CO2 concentration in ppm are considered as drivers\
    \ impacting crop yields."
  14: Temperature data (spatially-weighted, location-specific from Berkeley Earth),
    Mauna Loa annual CO2 data
  16: "Average annual level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; annual temperature\
    \ (\xB0C) in country i in year t."
  17: CO2, temperature (linear and quadratic terms)
  18: The drivers of risk are CO2 levels, temperature, and their interaction.
  19: "CO2 concentration, temperature, CO2-squared, Temperature-squared, CO2 \xD7\
    \ Temperature interaction"
  20: Temperature, CO2 levels, and interactions between the two.
  21: "CO2, Temperature, CO2-squared, Temperature-squared, CO2 \xD7 Temperature."
  22: "CO2 concentration and temperature (T), specifically deviations from the average\
    \ temperature (T\u0305 )."
  24: Temperature and CO2 concentration are identified as drivers impacting crop yields.
  25: Varying CO2 concentrations (0-1500 ppm for rapeseed, 0-1000 ppm for sorghum,
    and 0-800 ppm for the others) and temperature (varied depending on crop).
  26: Increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 can improve agricultural productivity...
    Higher levels of CO2 also make crops less susceptible to drought...overall a warmer
    atmosphere holds more moisture leading to increased rainfall...temperatures continue
    to rise with increasing CO2
  27: Atmospheric CO2 and temperatures
  28: Weather extremes (such as droughts), pests, fungus, and disease.

Highlights:
  4: The threat of food insecurity is overstated.
  7: Temperatures in Africa are on average higher than those elsewhere.
  8: The graphs show an overall increasing trend in yields for most crops, with some
    fluctuations. Different regions/datasets show varying yield levels and growth
    rates.
  9: Different crops exhibit different temperature trends across continents/datasets;
    some show increasing trends, while others remain relatively stable. For example,
    Soybean has a clear increasing trend in the top line, while others remain more
    consistent. Rapeseed temperatures show variation by continent.
  11: Global warming from 1981 to 2002 has offset some of the yield gains from technological
    advances, rising CO2, and other non-climatic factors. Climate impacts often exceeded
    10% of the rate of yield change, indicating a considerable drag on yield growth.
    If farmers adapted to the changed climate conditions, wheat, maize, and rice yields
    in temperate regions would increase as a result of higher temperatures, ceteris
    paribus, but production of maize and wheat would be adversely affected by higher
    temperatures in the tropics.
  12: Extends previous studies by considering temperature, CO2, technological advances,
    and other adaptations in regression models to present a clearer picture of future
    food security.
  17: For wheat, the signs on the coefficients on CO2 and temperature are positive
    and statistically significant, while those of the quadratic terms and interaction
    term are all negative and statistically significant.
  18: The marginal effects of CO2 and temperature on wheat yields exhibit diminishing
    returns, with the effect of CO2 on yields further diminishing at higher temperatures.
    The impact of CO2 on maize yields is weak, and the model is unable to uncover
    the full extent of CO2 and temperature effects on maize yields, possibly due to
    limited CO2 data.
  19: Soybean yields show diminishing returns with increasing CO2 and temperature.
    Rapeseed yields are positively correlated with increasing temperature, but the
    role of CO2 is ambiguous. The interaction between CO2 and temperature has a statistically
    significant but small effect on both soybean and rapeseed yields. The estimated
    parameter on the linear CO2 term for soybeans falls significantly when human capital
    is added as a control, indicating omitted variable bias.
  20: Rice appears sensitive to increasing temperatures, but the linear temperature
    term is statistically insignificant and CO2 terms are significant. CO2 fertilization
    is less effective at higher temperatures for sorghum.
  21: Marginal effects of temperature on crop yields have the expected signs. Rice
    has the most severe diminishing returns based on the interaction term. Tipping
    points are calculated at which increased temperature or CO2 leads to falling crop
    yields.
  22: Provides equations for calculating the marginal effects of CO2 and temperature
    on crop yields, and for estimating tipping points for CO2 and temperature.
  24: Increased CO2 levels generally result in higher yields up to a point, beyond
    which yield decreases with rising temperatures for Maize and Wheat. All lines
    across crops show a curved trend starting from the negative x-axis, reaching a
    peak, then declining towards the higher temperature range.
  25: Crop yields generally increase with CO2 concentration, but the response varies
    with temperature and crop type. Some crops (wheat, soybean, sorghum) show a parabolic
    response, with yield decreasing after an optimal CO2 level is reached. Rapeseed
    shows a positive linear relationship.
  26: The CO2-fertilization effect is prominent and is not being properly accounted
    for elsewhere...The negative impacts of global warming on food security is likely
    overstated as a result of overlooking CO2 as a determinant of crop yields.
  27: Empirical evidence indicates that crop yields have increased steadily since
    the 1960s, but the majority of scientists believe that at higher temperatures,
    the adverse effect of heat on crop yields will eventually offset the benefits
    of CO2 fertilization.
  28: Technological changes, particularly in plant breeding, genetic engineering,
    and pest control, will likely improve agricultural resilience to climate change
    and prevent future famines.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of country-level climate-crop yield relationships
  4: Fixed-effects panel regression model. CO2 levels measured at Mauna Loa, Hawaii,
    and weighted-average temperatures in each country. Includes PPP GDP, Human Capital
    Index, and controls for technological changes.
  6: 'The study examines the effect that changes in atmospheric CO2 and temperature
    have had on crop yields in the past to understand implications for the future.
    The analysis focuses on six main cereal crops: wheat, rice, maize, rapeseed (canola),
    soybean, and sorghum.'
  7: "Uses FAO crop yield data and Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) data\
    \ series to construct historical annual temperatures by crop and continent, spatially-weighted\
    \ by a continent\u2019s countries that are in the global top-twenty producing\
    \ countries of the crop in question for the period 1961-2018."
  8: The analysis is based on the FAOSTAT database (FAO, 2018). The graphs show historical
    yield trends over time.
  9: The analysis uses Berkeley Earth surface temperature data averaged for each crop
    across the top 20 producing countries. The results are applicable from 1961-2018
    for Rapeseed, and approximately 1960-2010 or 2020 for the other crops.
  11: First differences in yield with minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation
    as explanatory variables in linear regressions to minimize the influence of slowly
    changing factors such as crop management. Panel analyses of maize, wheat, rice
    and soybean were used to examine the impact of climate change on crop yields at
    the country level for the period 1980 to 2008, incorporating monthly temperature
    and precipitation, crop production, crop locations, and growing seasons.
  12: Regression models considering temperature, CO2, technological advances, and
    other adaptations. Uses historical data on crop yields from the FAO. Spatially-weighted
    temperatures at country levels and the interaction effects between CO2 and temperature
    are included.
  13: A panel regression model is used to observe variations in crop yields within
    periods and between countries, using data from 57 countries from 1961 to 2013.
  14: Uses production-weighted temperatures for large countries, adjusting USDA production
    data to sum to 100% within main producing regions. Assumes uniform CO2 distribution.
  15: Annual temperature data is used, which may not adequately reflect growing seasons
    or multiple cropping practices.
  16: Fixed effects panel regression model is used to analyze crop yields across countries
    and time periods, controlling for time-invariant regressors. The model includes
    CO2 levels, temperature, socio-demographic control variables, and fixed effects
    for time and country. Quadratic terms for temperature and CO2, as well as an interaction
    term, are included to account for potential nonlinearities.
  17: Fixed-effects model using both within- and across-country differences in weather.
    Regression equations developed in R and Stata.
  18: The analysis uses regression analysis to model the relationship between CO2,
    temperature, and crop yields (wheat and maize). The regressions include quadratic
    terms and an interaction term to capture non-linear effects and interactions.
    The models are run with and without controls for GDP per capita and a human capital
    index. Results are applicable to 46 countries for wheat and 51 countries for maize
    based on the data used.
  19: Regression analysis of soybean and rapeseed yields as a function of CO2, temperature,
    and their interactions, with and without controls for GDP per capita and human
    capital. The models are estimated using data from multiple countries (45 for soybean,
    35 for rapeseed) and multiple years (resulting in 1,932 observations for soybeans
    and 1,395 for rapeseed).
  20: Regression models were used to analyze the relationship between crop yields
    and temperature/CO2. Specific results may be inapplicable to rice due to the unique
    growing environment.
  21: Regression analysis is used to model rice and sorghum yields as a function of
    CO2, temperature, and interaction terms. Marginal effects are evaluated at average
    CO2 and temperature levels. Tipping points are computed by setting first-order
    partial derivatives with respect to CO2 and temperature equal to zero.
  22: Marginal effects are derived from regression models. Underlined parameters indicate
    statistical insignificance at the 10% level. Tipping points are computed as estimates
    of parameter values using their averages computed from the regression models.
    The equations used for calculating CO2 and temperature tipping points are provided.
  24: The relationship between temperature and crop yield is plotted for various CO2
    concentrations, allowing for a visual analysis of yield changes under different
    climate scenarios. Tipping point of 396.2 ppm CO2 for wheat yields is mentioned.
  25: Empirical analysis presenting crop yield response curves to varying CO2 concentrations
    at different temperature levels.
  28: Discussion of potential technological changes and their impacts on agriculture.
    The analysis is based on general trends and expectations about future technological
    advancements.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on climate-crop yield relationships, indicating an investigation
    into how climate variables affect crop yields at a country level.
  3: The paper focuses on country-level relationships between climate and crop yield.
  7: The continental temperature averages are spatially weighted based on the top
    20 producing countries for each crop, which can change the composition of the
    average from crop to crop and year to year.
  8: The graphs show regional differences in rapeseed, highlighting that Europe had
    the highest yield.
  9: The use of different line styles to represent different continents or datasets
    within the same graph makes it easy to compare temperature trends.
  11: The first study did not consider the impact of CO2-fertilization and adaptation
    measures taken by farmers. Lobell et al. (2011) did not consider the impact of
    CO2 fertilization and other factors such as technological advances in their statistical
    models. Challinor et al. (2014) conducted a meta-analysis of 1,048 observations
    from 66 studies to determine the separate impacts of adaptation, change in temperature,
    change in CO2, and change in precipitation on crop yields in tropical and temperate
    regions.
  12: The study uses crop yield data from the top twenty producers of each crop.
  13: The data suggests a lot of overlap in top 20 crop-producing countries, meaning
    that if a country is a top producer of one crop, it is likely to be a top producer
    of another.
  14: The paper acknowledges the strong assumption of uniform CO2 distribution due
    to data limitations.
  16: The analysis acknowledges the limitations of assuming uniform CO2 distribution
    and not accounting for different crop cultivars and planting times.
  17: The analysis excludes solar radiation and precipitation due to data unavailability
    at the scale of the study. This exclusion creates a potential endogeneity issue,
    which is addressed by the inclusion of linear and quadratic terms in the fixed-effects
    model.
  18: The addition of controls (GDP per capita and human capital index) suggests that
    the effects of CO2 and temperature on wheat yields are overstated in the original
    regression. The adjusted R-squared values indicate the goodness of fit for each
    model.
  21: Table includes models with and without GDP/capita and human capital controls.
  22: The marginal effect of CO2 (temperature) can be evaluated at the average level
    of temperature (CO2) to isolate the main effects.
  24: The statement suggesting that crop yields have been inconsistent with the tipping
    point reality implies an argument that current observations do not match the expected
    negative impacts from CO2 levels.
  25: The text notes the uncertainty in determining tipping points for crops like
    soybeans, and the importance of considering diminishing positive CO2 effects.
  26: Further research using regional CO2 data is an obvious next step...global CO2
    is simply not a good enough proxy for identifying crop-specific regional effects
    on crop yields.
  27: Future technological change is considered the greatest unknown factor in determining
    the impact of climate change on agriculture. The paper suggests that the impact
    of climate change on agriculture is a matter of interpretation, dependent on study
    selection and evidence presentation.
  28: The authors express optimism about technological advancements in agriculture
    and suggest that only ignoring these advancements might lead to future food security
    issues due to climate change.
