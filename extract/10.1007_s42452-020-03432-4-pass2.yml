  28: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on crop yield.
  3: Country-level climate-crop yield relationships
  14: Spatially-weighted, location-specific temperature data; Mauna Loa annual CO2
    data.
  15: Political changes in countries such as Sudan, the Soviet Union and Ethiopia;
    extraneous factors.
  16: Different crop cultivars and planting times can lead to dissimilar responses
    to climate change.
  18: CO2 levels and temperature.
  19: CO2 levels, temperature
  21: CO2 levels, temperature
  22: Changes in CO2 levels and temperature are analyzed as impacting the outcomes
    related to specific crops.
  23: Lack of statistical significance in temperature and CO2 effects on crop yield
    suggests measurement and methodological issues.
  24: Changing CO2 concentrations and temperature variations impact crop yield, which
    can influence agricultural productivity at a national level.
  27: Increases in atmospheric CO2 and/or temperatures; Adverse effect of heat on
    crop yields; Climate change
  28: Global warming (specifically impacting agriculture)
Highlights:
  18: The marginal effects of CO2 and temperature on wheat yields exhibit diminishing
    returns, with the effect of CO2 on yields further diminishing at higher temperatures.
    The impact of CO2 on maize yields appears weak. The addition of GDP per capita
    and the human capital index suggests that the effects of CO2 and temperature are
    overstated in the original regression (for wheat).
  19: Soybean yields show diminishing benefits from increasing CO2 and temperature,
    eventually declining. Rapeseed yields are positively correlated with increasing
    temperature, but the effect of CO2 is ambiguous. The interaction between CO2 and
    temperature has a statistically significant, but small, effect on both soybean
    and rapeseed yields. Adding human capital controls significantly reduces the estimated
    parameter on the linear CO2 term for soybeans.
  21: Temperature has a statistically significant positive impact on both rice and
    sorghum yields. The interaction term between CO2 and Temperature is statistically
    significant for both crops. Rice exhibits more severe diminishing returns to temperature
    increases based on the interaction term.
  22: The page presents marginal effects of CO2 and temperature on different crops
    and explains the calculation of tipping points using regression results.
  23: Statistically significant CO2 tipping points for wheat (396.2 ppm), soybean
    (416.7 ppm), and sorghum (670.9 ppm).
  27: "The evidence regarding the impact of climate change on agriculture is a matter\
    \ of interpretation, dependent on which studies are chosen to support one\u2019\
    s viewpoint and how the evidence is presented. Future technological change remains\
    \ the greatest unknown factor."
  28: Technological changes will greatly improve the ability of agricultural producers
    to adapt to climate change; global warming might lead to famines and starvation
    in the future only when the scope for technological improvements is ignored.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of country-level climate-crop yield relationships.
  3: Extended essay
  14: The study employs spatially-weighted temperature data, CO2 data, and the Penn
    World Table database to infer the impact of climate change on crop yield trends.
  15: Using output-based approach to calculate PPP GDP; using Penn World Table's human
    capital index to control for education levels; modifying data from 1961-2017 for
    USSR, Russia, Ethiopian PDR, and Ethiopia; ignoring data for Taiwan, South Sudan,
    Yugoslavia SFR; treating Serbia and Montenegro as separate entities.
  16: A fixed effects panel regression model is used to examine the impact of atmospheric
    CO2 levels and temperature on crop yields.
  18: Regression analysis is used to model the relationship between wheat and maize
    yields and CO2 levels and temperature, including squared terms and interaction
    terms to capture non-linear effects. Some models control for GDP per capita and
    human capital index.
  19: Regression analysis of the relationship between CO2, temperature, and crop yields
    (soybean and rapeseed). Controls for GDP/capita and human capital are included
    in some models.
  21: Regression analysis using a panel dataset of countries. Marginal effects are
    calculated and evaluated at average CO2 and temperature levels. Tipping points
    (where increased CO2 or temperature lead to falling yields) are computed by setting
    first-order partial derivatives equal to zero.
  22: The analysis involves regression models to derive marginal effects for CO2 and
    temperature by crop type, and tipping points are computed using linear and quadratic
    terms from these models.
  23: Analysis using CO2 and temperature as key variables; tipping points lack significance
    and need further investigation.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on food security as an outcome affected by climate change via
    crop yields. This is indirectly relevant to macro-fiscal risks as food security
    issues can lead to broader economic instability and require government intervention
    (expenditure, etc.). Further review of the paper is needed to determine whether
    this page contributes to macro-economic and macro-fiscal risk as food security
    is only one aspect.
  3: The paper focuses on climate change impacts on food security via crop yield relationships.
    This suggests a potential pathway to macroeconomic and fiscal risks, but the page
    doesn't directly address macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, or adaptation costs/benefits
    at a national level. It is a study of the relationship between climate, crop yield,
    and food security.
  14: The authors acknowledge a strong assumption that atmospheric CO2 is uniformly
    distributed and does not vary across countries due to data limitations.
  15: The production map provided by the USDA is a rough approximation of crop production
    and national average temperatures for most countries; annual temperature data
    do not adequately consider the actual growing seasons for various crops.
  16: The paper highlights the complexity of modeling due to different planting times
    and cultivar variations, and acknowledges the strong assumption of uniform CO2
    distribution.
  18: "The model specification includes CO2-squared and Temperature-squared terms\
    \ to capture non-linear relationships. The interaction term (CO2 \xD7 Temp) is\
    \ included to account for the combined effect of CO2 and temperature. The models\
    \ are fitted to panel data on 46 or 51 countries for wheat and maize analysis,\
    \ respectively."
  19: The number of observations varies between soybean and rapeseed regressions,
    based on data availability.
  21: The analysis considers the impact of GDP/capita and human capital on crop yields
    in some specifications.
  23: Tipping points are approached with caution due to insufficient statistical significance.
  27: The paper acknowledges the potential for tipping points in crop yields but states
    an inability to identify them. It also suggests that technological advancements
    like weather-indexed insurance, GPS, drones, and new irrigation technologies can
    incentivize and enable adaptation to climate change in agriculture.
