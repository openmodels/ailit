Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in climate affecting crop yields.
  2: Seasonal temperature, rainfall, climate change scenarios
  5: Changes in local climatic patterns observed by farmers, average temperature,
    average rainfall, dry and wet seasons (November-March and April-October respectively).
  6: Climate change is the primary driver of risk, impacting crop production and potentially
    requiring adaptation measures.
  8: Temperature (wet and dry season) and Rainfall (wet and dry season)
  9: Climate variables (wet and dry season temperatures, rainfall)
  10: Temperature (wet and dry season), Rainfall (wet and dry season), Soil type (clay
    and sandy)
  11: Temperature increase, rainfall increase, and seasonal variations in temperature
    and rainfall.
  12: Rising temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns.
  13: Changes in rainfall and surface temperature.
  14: Changes in seasonal temperature and rainfall; clay soils
Highlights:
  1: The study aims to measure the economic impacts of climate change on crop farming
    in Bangladesh.
  2: Net crop income in Bangladesh is sensitive to climate, particularly to seasonal
    temperature; a positive effect of temperature rise on net crop income was observed
    for farms with sufficient irrigation facilities; climate change scenarios project
    an increase in net crop income.
  8: The marginal impacts of temperature and rainfall on net crop income are estimated.
  9: Climate variables have a nonlinear relationship with net crop incomes. Wet season
    temperature has an inverted U-shaped relationship with net crop income, while
    dry season temperature has a U-shaped relationship. Rainfall in both seasons has
    a hill-shaped relationship.
  10: Farming experience, access to irrigation facilities, and farm size are positively
    and significantly correlated with net crop income. Clay soils are associated with
    lower net incomes.
  11: Increasing temperature in the wet season is beneficial, while increasing temperature
    in the dry season is detrimental to net crop incomes. Increased rainfall is generally
    beneficial. Seasonal variations are a vital factor for net income in both cropping
    seasons. Net crop income is more sensitive to temperature changes than rainfall
    changes.
  12: Bangladesh agriculture appears to be adapting against warming. Marginal impacts
    of temperature showed that most of the climatic zones would experience a positive
    effect on net incomes, though the coefficients for all climatic zones are not
    statistically significant.
  13: Future climate change is projected to increase temperatures in Bangladesh, leading
    to changes in rainfall patterns. These climate changes are projected to impact
    net crop incomes, with the increment in the net income per hectare being more
    in the period of 2061-2100 than 2021-2060 under both climate scenarios, though
    the direction of the impacts will not be uniform across different climatic zones.
  14: Farmers' current net incomes are sensitive to climate, with seasonal temperature
    having a more pronounced effect than rainfall. Climate change is projected to
    increase net crop income in Bangladesh, but the impact varies significantly across
    climatic zones.
Methodology:
  1: A Ricardian model was used to estimate the relationship between net crop income
    and climate variables, using historical climate data and farm household level
    data from all climatic zones of Bangladesh.
  2: Econometric model, Ricardian model
  5: Ricardian methodology used to model the relationship between climate and agriculture.
  6: The paper discusses assessment models such as computable general equilibrium
    and whole farm models, based on climate-crop physiology and development, used
    to assess climate change impacts in Bangladesh. These models can incorporate adaptation
    practices like changing planting dates, variety selection, and fertilizer use.
  8: Ricardian model regression using STATA (version 14.0) to analyze the impact of
    climate variables on net crop income. Quadratic terms are included to capture
    non-linear relationships. Reduced form model used to counter endogeneity. Robust
    estimation applied to minimize heteroscedasticity.
  9: The analysis uses Ricardian models to estimate the relationship between climate
    variables and net crop incomes. Household characteristics were also controlled
    for.
  10: Ricardian regression analysis across seven climatic zones in Bangladesh
  11: Marginal impacts of climate variables on net crop incomes per hectare are estimated.
    The exchange rate used is US$1 = 80.64 BDT.
  12: Ricardian regression model is used to calculate the marginal impacts of climate
    across different climatic zones.
  13: 'Impacts of future climate change on crop farming in Bangladesh are examined
    using future changes in rainfall and surface temperature for each district, estimated
    using two Coupled Atmospheric Oceanic General Circulation Models (AOGCMs): BNU-ESM
    and CanESM2 under RCP8.5 scenario for the periods 2021-2060 and 2061-2100, relative
    to the historical 1971-2005. The impacts of these AOGCM scenarios on net incomes
    are estimated using a fitted net income model.'
  14: Ricardian regression model is used to assess the economic impacts of climate
    change on crop farming in Bangladesh. Results are applicable to the period of
    the climate model projections (2021-2100).
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on the economic impacts of climate change on the overall crop
    farming sector in Bangladesh.
  5: The paper uses a map of the seven climatic zones of Bangladesh. The climatic
    zones are South-western, South-eastern, North-eastern, North-western, South-central,
    Northern part of the norther zone and Northern zone.
  6: The paper highlights the limitations of crop-specific models, which may overestimate
    or underestimate climate impacts by failing to account for economic stimuli, input
    replacement, price variations, crop shifting, and multi-cropping.
  8: The paper estimates the relationship between climate variables (temperature and
    rainfall) and net crop income. The quadratic terms in the model allow for U-shaped
    or hill-shaped relationships between climate variables and net crop income.
  9: Farmers are adapting to climate change through various strategies, including
    using new crop varieties, adjusting sowing dates, and diversifying crops.
  10: The model explains net crop incomes across seven climatic zones in Bangladesh.
    The sample size is 396.
  11: The study focuses on Bangladesh. The impact of rainfall in the winter cropping
    season is statistically significant (p < 0.05).
  13: The study focuses on the impacts on net crop incomes specifically within Bangladesh.
  14: Adaptation policies should target different climatic zones based on their specific
    constraints and potentials. Essential climate adaptation policy recommendations
    include strengthening research capacity, enhancing enterprise diversification,
    providing crop insurance, and strengthening agricultural extension systems.

Quantitative material:
  2: "1 mm/month increase in rainfall and 10\xB0C increase in temperature will lead\
    \ to about US$4-15 increase in net crop income per hectare in Bangladesh; an increase\
    \ in net crop income from US$25-84 per hectare in the country under climate change\
    \ scenarios."

    Mean temperature in wet season is 28.11 degrees Celsius (SD=0.53), dry season
    is 21.16 degrees Celsius (SD=0.98). Mean rainfall in wet season is 300.38 mm (SD=106.21),

    income.
  11: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature during the wet season would result in an income\
    \ gain of about US$15.64 per hectare, while in the dry season it would cause a\

    \ $11 to $48 (USD) in some climatic zones, while others experience a negative\
    \ impact of US$9.51-16.31 per hectare. A 1 mm/month increase in rainfall leads\
