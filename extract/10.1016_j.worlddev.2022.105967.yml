Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change
  2: Changes in weather variables (vapor pressure deficit, wet day frequency, and
    temperature).
  3: Temperature increase, increased vapor pressure deficit (VPD), changes in wet
    day frequency.
  6: Weather measures specific to the millet producing area (MPA), their spatial and
    temporal lags, and the lag of the endogenous variable in space are considered.
  7: "Average temperature (\xB0C), average wet days fraction (WDF), average vapor\
    \ pressure deficit (VPD) (kPa)."
  8: Temperature, water deficit factor (WDF), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) significantly
    influence millet yield.
  13: "Projected increases in temperature, changes in WDF, and VPD shown under the\
    \ RCP8.5 scenario for 2040\u20132069."
Highlights:
  2: Own-location weather variables have significant contemporaneous impacts on millet
    yield; spatial and temporal spillovers affect wet day cumulative effect; local
    crop production is affected by neighboring countries' production; results are
    robust across country-income groups.
  3: Temperature increase and VPD are associated with millet yield loss, while increased
    wet day frequency improves output; the effect of temperature on millet yield differs
    between poor and rich SSA countries, with poor countries more adversely affected.
  6: The study uses country-specific growing seasons, unlike prior SSA studies that
    use a generalized form of growing season across countries.
  7: Random variation of weather variables affect millet yield.
  8: Spatial model (SDM) reveals that direct effects of climate factors are significant,
    and indirect (spillover) effects are minimal, emphasizing local impacts.
  13: The CCC model predicts the highest temperature increase, leading to potential
    dire impacts on regional millet yields.
Methodology:
  1: Spatial panel data approach
  2: Spatial panel data approach is used, controlling for spatial effects and spatio-temporal
    econometrics techniques.
  3: Spatio-temporal panel data model with spatial lags of the dependent variable
    and regressors, errors clustered at location level, and temporal lags of regressors;
    analysis applied to pearl millet production in SSA, using country-specific growing
    seasons.
  6: A spatial econometric model is used to assess the impact of weather variables
    on millet yield.
  7: Panel data analysis with country fixed effects and a time trend. Spatial regression
    models using inverse distance spatial weights, 4-nearest neighbor spatial weights,
    and spatial weights based on the prevailing economic network.
  8: A spatial Durbin model (SDM) and a non-spatial model (NS) are compared using
    maximum likelihood estimation to account for spatially-dependent errors in yield
    estimation.
