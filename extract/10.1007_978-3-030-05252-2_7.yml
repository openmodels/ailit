  148: Rising demand and deeply uncertain future water supplies, particularly due
    to potentially significantly different future hydrologic conditions in the Colorado
    River Basin as a result of climate change, threaten the reliability of the Colorado
    River Basin system.
  150: "Future water demand; Streamflow under different climate regimes (resampled\
    \ historical record, resampled paleoclimate record, downscaled global climate\
    \ model projections); Climate conditions leading to streamflow conditions (historical\
    \ periods with less than average precipitation, projected climate conditions (which\

  234: The text discusses uncertainties involved in designing infrastructure projects
    like LNG plants due to variable forecasts in demand and economies of scale.
  235: Uncertainty in demand leads to lower overall value, particularly in capacity-constrained
    systems, as potential gains from excess demand are limited, and losses from underutilization
    are more impactful.
  236: Uncertain LNG demand impacts the most profitable plant size and its economic
    value.
  238: Uncertainty in demand impacting the NPV of the project, particularly concerning
    whether sufficient demand materializes to justify a larger fixed plant.

Highlights:
  5: The book provides guidance in identifying and applying appropriate approaches
    and tools to design policies and advice on implementing these policies in the
    real world.
  14: Decisionmaking for the future depends on anticipating change, which is becoming
    increasingly difficult, creating anxiety when conforming short-term decisions
    to long-term objectives or preparing for rare events.
  21: Highlights the limitations of traditional applied scientific work which assumes
    uncertainties are of Levels 1 or 2. Notes that important problems faced by decisionmakers
    are often characterized by a higher level of uncertainty (Level 4a and 4b) that
    cannot be sufficiently reduced by gathering more information.
  28: The underlying paradigm of these tools is the need for actions to reduce the
    vulnerability of a policy or strategy to uncertain future developments.
  35: RDM's approach to adaptive strategies includes agent-based modeling and complex
    systems analysis.
  38: RDM helps to identify trade-offs among alternative decision options and compares
    decision outcomes addressing multiple objectives. There is a focus on decision-making
    processes being layered and explicit about goals and available evidence.
  41: The emphasis is on robustness as a property of the ensemble of results and the
    utility of exploratory models in informing policy choices.
  50: Comparison between economy-wide carbon tax and a technology price subsidy for
    low-carbon-emitting technologies using an agent-based model to determine strategy
    robustness.
  52: Taxes Only and Combined strategies consistently perform better than No Action
    and Subsidies Only strategies.
  53: Taxes Only performs best when the potential for coordination failures and the
    impacts from climate change are small, and Combined performs best otherwise. Both
    strategies perform better than No Action or Subsidies Only. A combination of price
    instruments and technology subsidies may prove the most robust strategy over a
    wide range of plausible futures.
  54: The study suggests that combining carbon taxes and technology incentives may
    be a promising component of a robust strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions,
    especially if there are concerns about market imperfections or serious climate
    change impacts.
  55: No relevant information
  73: The table outlines strategies to mitigate risks and capitalize on opportunities
    related to air traffic, environmental impact, and climate change, focusing on
    maintaining market share, managing noise pollution, and adapting to changing conditions.
  76: The Dynamic Adaptive Planning (DAP) framework is used to manage risks related
    to air traffic demand, hub carrier stability, low-cost carriers, transfer rates,
    and environmental impact.
  78: DAP encourages planners to consider 'what if' scenarios and make decisions over
    time to adapt while maintaining flexibility. It makes explicit that adaptation
    is a dynamic process that takes place over time.
  79: No relevant information
  81: DAPP explores alternative sequences of decisions (adaptation pathways) for multiple
    futures and illuminates the path dependency of alternative strategies, helping
    to overcome policy paralysis due to deep uncertainty.
  86: The methodology allows for identifying opportunities, no-regret actions, lock-ins,
    and the timing of actions under changing conditions.
  90: Climate change poses a significant risk to the navigation function of the River
    Waas.
  92: Small ships and large-scale dredging can achieve targets for the next 100 years
    in all plausible futures.
  94: Different adaptation pathways have varying costs, benefits, and co-benefits
    under a high-end scenario. Some pathways have high benefits but also negative
    co-benefits, while others have low costs but also low benefits.
  95: DAPP makes path dependencies explicit to limit stranded assets and inflexible
    lock-ins, and motivates planners to consider transformative actions beyond traditional
    practices.
  103: The opportuneness strategy seeks windfalls at minimal uncertainty.
  104: IG theory is useful when models are expected to improve significantly in the
    near future, when processes are changing in poorly known ways, or when important
    factors are determined beyond one's knowledge or control.
  108: The robust-satisficing decision optimizes the robustness against uncertainty
    rather than optimizing the substantive quality of the decision's outcome. The
    outcome must be satisfactory, but the analyst can choose the satisficing level.
    The paper emphasizes optimizing robustness and satisficing the outcome.
  109: A system is considered highly robust against uncertainty if it exhibits strength
    in some or all of the attributes of resilience, redundancy, flexibility, adaptiveness,
    and comprehensiveness.
  115: 'Robustness trades off against performance: increasing robustness requires
    relaxing performance requirements. Robustness becomes zero at the performance
    level predicted by the best-estimate model (zeroing).'
  116: Model predictions have no robustness against error in the model when there
    are large info-gaps; the predicted outcome may not reliably characterize the system.
  117: Opportuneness is useful for decision support because a more opportune option
    is better able to exploit propitious uncertainty. The opportuneness function values
    are used to prioritize options; smaller values are preferred.
  122: "Robustness decreases as the required probability of failure decreases (trade-off\
    \ property). Robustness jumps to infinity when Pc = 2Pf(\u02DCp). Robustness becomes\
    \ zero when Pc = Pf(\u02DCp)."
  123: Predicted outcomes based on the best available models have no robustness against
    uncertainty. Prioritize alternatives according to their robustness for achieving
    critical outcomes, supplemented by analysis of opportuneness for windfall.
  128: EOA results in clear, compact representations that support insights into good
    strategies for dealing with deep uncertainty.
  133: EOA suggests that modular, flexible strategies can provide greater expected
    gains and lower risks compared to single, large-scale facilities, often at a substantial
    saving of initial capital expenditures (Capex), leading to a win-win outcome.
  134: A flexible design that starts with a smaller structure with extra strength
    to enable expansion when conditions are right is preferred, reducing possible
    losses and increasing possible gains in case of high demand.
  140: Focus on the practical application of Engineering Options Analysis to decision-making
    under uncertainty.
  142: No relevant information
  143: RDM can be useful for addressing long-term policy challenges associated with
    multifaceted, nonlinear, natural and socio-economic systems. The case studies
    involve developing robust strategies that are adaptive.
  145: RDM provides a framework to identify vulnerabilities of current strategies
    and develop adaptive strategies that can succeed across a broad range of plausible
    futures.
  146: RDM process involves steps such as Decision Framing, evaluating strategies
    in many futures, conducting vulnerability analysis using Scenario Discovery, and
    exploring trade-offs among candidate strategies.
  150: Under current management of the Colorado River Basin system, both the Upper
    Basin and Lower Basin may fail to meet water delivery reliability objectives under
    many futures within the evaluated plausible range.
  152: "Portfolio A (Inclusive) has the greatest potential to prevent water delivery\
    \ vulnerability but risks incurring the highest costs; Portfolios A and B lead\
    \ to the fewest number of years with critically low Lake Mead levels, but the\
    \ costs range from $5.5\u2013$7.5 billion per year."
  153: Adaptive strategies do not completely eliminate regret, indicating underinvestment
    in driest futures and overinvestment in wettest futures, due to simplistic triggers
    and inherent uncertainties.
  154: Adaptive strategies ("Baseline" and "Aggressive") are more balanced in managing
    risk compared to static strategies ("Current Management" and "Implement All Actions").
    The "Baseline" strategy has moderate regret in the driest conditions, while the
    "Aggressive" strategy is low regret under wetter conditions.
  156: The paper provides an example of how to revise beliefs about water supply availability
    over time in response to streamflow data and how this can inform adaptive water
    management strategies. It illustrates how to develop a robust adaptive strategy
    by linking vulnerabilities to investment in water supply.
  158: Many plausible futures exist where current water management strategies are
    insufficient. If the probability of facing a Severely Declining Supply scenario
    is 30%, then transformative options are likely needed.
  159: RDM helps identify robust policies for international decarbonization despite
    uncertainties.
  162: Higher R&D returns can lead to parity in technology productivity under optimal
    policies. The optimal policy mix (carbon taxes, research subsidies, technology
    subsidies) may vary depending on the climate scenario (more or less abrupt climate
    change).
  163: The implementation of an international carbon tax, homogenous or not, can induce
    international decarbonization, but under many scenarios it fails to do this at
    a rate that meets the Paris objectives; the technological progress of SETs relative
    to FETs can affect the structure and effect of optimal environmental regulation
    to the same degree as climate uncertainty.
  164: Elasticity of substitution of technological sectors and climate sensitivity
    are key drivers of vulnerability. Low relative transferability makes it difficult
    to meet cost and climate targets regardless of other uncertainty dimensions. Dark
    cells refer to GCF-based policies (P3-P7), and light cells denote the independent
    policy architectures (P1 and P2).
  165: No single policy is shown to be robust across all futures. Independent carbon
    taxation is identified as a necessary first step. Subsequent policy pathways are
    triggered depending on unfolding climate and technological conditions. If climate
    sensitivity is extremely high, environmental regulations above the 10% cost threshold
    would be necessary.
  166: Optimal environmental regulation for climate change mitigation is not static
    but dynamic, adapting to changing climate and technological conditions. Different
    cooperation regimes under the Green Climate Fund (GCF) are best suited for different
    combinations of climate and technological conditions, allowing for a dynamic framework
    for technological cooperation.
  194: DAPP facilitated decision-making to consider the sensitivity of alternative
    policies to a range of factors.
  195: New Zealand flood risk managers applied the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways
    (DAPP) approach to managing deep uncertainty around flood frequency associated
    with changing climate and the page examines the lessons learned from taking DAPP
    theory into practice.
  196: Climate change can undermine the effectiveness of flood protection schemes,
    and a perceived high level of protection can diminish the need for planning rules
    to address residual risk.
  198: DAPP is an approach to planning adaptation strategies that considers different
    future scenarios and allows for adjustments over time.
  200: The study identifies six feasible pathways for flood protection in the Hutt
    River City Centre. The pathways are evaluated based on their costs, target effects,
    social impacts, transport impacts, and environmental impacts.
  202: Communities may prefer to pay more for certainty of outcome than a pure cost-effectiveness
    analysis might suggest; DAPP approach enables exploration of a full range of plausible
    futures; 'knowledge brokers' are necessary for the adoption of new approaches;
    certainty of funding can be a stronger motivator than cost-effectiveness.
  203: Leadership and political backing were crucial for the adoption of DAPP in flood
    management, significantly enhancing decision-making.
  210: Infrastructure needs to be planned for many decades in the presence of significant
    uncertainty; Policymaking needs to manage the uncertainty related to incomplete
    scientific understanding, extrapolation, and decision-making practice.
  220: "The robustness of a design is defined as the greatest horizon-of-uncertainty\
    \ (\u02C6h) up to which the predicted peak stress does not violate the requirement."
  223: The study emphasizes the trade-off between performance requirements and robustness
    in mechanical latch design, showing that greater performance demands lead to less
    robustness to uncertainties.
  230: EOA can identify preferable strategies and guide decisionmakers toward better
    solutions, even if it cannot conclusively identify the 'best' plan due to uncertainty.
    It emphasizes selecting initial steps that provide flexibility to adapt as future
    events become more certain, leading to productive, value-enhancing strategies
    without specifying the value in detail.
  234: The concept of a 'design sweet spot' where the optimal plant size maximizes
    NPV, influenced by economies of scale.
  235: Deterministic analysis can be systematically incorrect and misleading in a
    realistically uncertain world, particularly for capacity-constrained systems.
  236: Considering uncertainty leads to smaller optimal plant designs and lower expected
    values compared to deterministic analyses.
  238: A flexible strategy involving capacity expansion at the main production site
    when demand justifies it significantly outperforms a fixed design that takes advantage
    of economies of scale.
  241: Lower economies of scale and greater learning rates increase the value of flexibility.
    Flexibility offers significant potential.
  247: Analysis includes uncertainty in water heights, natural variability in precipitation,
    and uncertainty in the precipitation-canal inflow relationship.
  251: Reactive Adaptive and Proactive Flexible designs perform better than the Fixed
    design across all scenarios and discount rates. Proactive Flexible is more valuable
    in the riskier scenario.
  252: Reactive Adaptive design can become the dominant solution at a 5.5% discount
    rate, erasing the disadvantage of expensive future adaptations of Proactive Flexible
    design.
  253: Proactive Flexible design is cheaper than Fixed design as it defers or avoids
    an increment of height.
  254: Reactive Adaptive design has lower average costs but higher risks (larger range
    of possible outcomes). Fixed design might be preferred to avoid risks.
  265: The Decision analytic approach separates the understanding of the decision
    from the estimates of probabilities of future states, allowing for analysis independent
    of specific climate futures.
  268: The paper highlights the advancement of the climate stress test over traditional
    sensitivity analysis by incorporating the correlated behavior of multiple variables
    simultaneously.
  269: The stress test can reveal if a system is relatively insensitive to changes
    in climate or other stressors, making further analysis unnecessary. Alternatively,
    it can show extreme sensitivity, suggesting proactive measures are needed sooner.
  271: The analysis highlights the climate changes that cause adaptation to be necessary
    as represented by tipping points or thresholds.
  274: The analysis determines which adaptations can preserve outcomes above their
    thresholds across the range of future scenarios. The decision to accept a specific
    adaptation strategy then relies on an appraisal of the resilience of the original
    system and the alternatives considered. The climate risk analysis can be used
    to compare alternative plans or to evaluate the additional robustness that a specific
    planned adaptation might provide.
  283: System performance is considered adequate if indoor water demands are met for
    the entire simulation (100% supply reliability).
  286: Accounting for intra-family model correlations in climate projections significantly
    increases the estimated risk to the water utility. Even a small probability (0.7%)
    of system failure is considered important due to the intolerable impact on the
    local community.
  288: Current water management system is robust under current demand but highly vulnerable
    under increased demand in the future; The future Build-Out scenario has substantial
    probability of problematic climate conditions; New tools are needed to efficiently
    propagate uncertainty throughout the modeling chain.
  319: There is a need for some decoupling of monitoring, knowledge creation, and
    knowledge assessment from a potentially politicized rulemaking organization.
  331: Adaptation is needed because mitigation efforts are insufficient and the climate
    will continue to change; climate change is not just an environmental issue but
    a broad societal issue with large social and economic consequences; climate change
    offers opportunities for both private and public sectors.
  333: Implementation of a Delta Fund and Delta programme to enhance climate adaptation;
    political commitment through a 'grand decision' to start large-scale climate adaptation.
  335: "Adaptivity is key when dealing with uncertainty; new Delta Plans would not\
    \ automatically contain the same type of gigantic structures as the Delta Plans\
    \ that was drafted after the \uFB02ooding of 1953."
  337: Adaptive Delta Management (ADM) can contribute to reducing chances of over-
    and underinvesting but carries the risk of lost income by keeping options open;
    identified no legislative barriers to fine-tuning measures.
  338: "Adaptive Delta Management and thinking in adaptation pathways are seen as\
    \ important outcomes of the Delta programme. The three \u201Ccore qualities\u201D\
    \ of the Delta programme that need to be preserved in the next phase are \u201C\
    shared ownership,\u201D \u201Ccoherence,\u201D and \u201Cadaptivity.\u201D"
  350: ADM approach is relatively easy to explain to laymen and decisionmakers and
    offers enough room for tailoring; Adaptation pathways have proven to be effective
    in keeping decision processes moving forward; DMDU approaches can profit from
    feedback from researchers and practitioners.
  351: The MAA system stimulates technical and strategic learning, helps to focus
    attention on central administrative questions, and unveils discrepancies in views
    on the distribution of responsibilities among different organizations.
  358: The paper focuses on building blocks of DMDU approaches, allowing for flexible
    adaptation to specific contexts and moving beyond general statements about comprehensive
    approaches.
  377: DMDU approaches can improve policy analysis by acknowledging and addressing
    deep uncertainties, providing a common vocabulary for analysts and policymakers,
    and enabling more adaptive policy processes.
  378: DMDU methods may enhance the understanding of choices and aid decision-making
    to more reliably achieve long-term objectives in the presence of deep uncertainty.
  396: DMDU approaches aim to improve the adaptivity and robustness of policies, making
    them more resistant to change and helping decision-makers identify when to adapt.
  397: The essential idea is that decision-makers facing deep uncertainty create a
    shared strategic vision of future ambitions, explore possible adaptive strategies,
    commit to short-term actions, while keeping long-term options open, and prepare
    a framework that guides future actions. The DMDU approaches aim to reduce uncertainty
    about the performance of policies.
  400: DMDU applications offer a body of theory and practice with the potential for
    providing a common vocabulary to the work of both analysts and of those charged
    with policy design and implementation during uncertain times.
  403: No relevant information
  404: Defines Adaptation Tipping Point (ATP) as when a policy is no longer able to
    achieve its objectives and Adaptive Policy as a policy designed to be changed
    over time as new information becomes available.
Methodology:
  5: The book provides a unified and comprehensive treatment of approaches and tools
    for developing policies under deep uncertainty and their application. It elucidates
    the state of the art in both theory and practice associated with decisionmaking
    under deep uncertainty.
  14: Addresses decision-making under deep uncertainty.
  21: Discusses dealing with uncertainty using scenarios, where robust policies are
    determined to produce favorable outcomes across a range of possible future worlds.
    Addresses decision-making under deep uncertainty.
  26: Uses DMDU (Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty) approach, which involves
    framing analysis, exploring outcomes of policies given uncertainties, selecting
    initial policy actions, planning for communication and adaptation, iterating,
    and re-examining the process.
  28: Scenario Discovery (SD) identifies combinations of future conditions that best
    distinguish cases in which a policy or strategy does or does not meet its goals.
  35: RDM does not focus on predictions but aims to yield better decisions under deep
    uncertainty.
  38: Analysis involves using Robust Decision Making (RDM) which draws from Decision
    Analysis, Assumption-Based Planning, scenarios, and Exploratory Modeling.
  40: "RDM uses quantitative \u201CScenario Discovery\u201D algorithms to pursue the\
    \ same ends as the Intuitive Logics school."
  41: Exploratory Modeling is used for Robust Decision Making, focusing on identifying
    and evaluating robust strategies across a range of scenarios without privileging
    one set of assumptions.
  43: This page describes Robust Decision Making (RDM), an approach for evaluating
    strategies under deep uncertainty using simulation models and scenario discovery.
    It involves framing the decision, evaluating strategies across plausible futures,
    performing vulnerability analysis, tradeoff analysis, and developing new strategies
    across futures.
  45: The paper discusses Robust Decision Making (RDM) methodology, an iterative process
    involving deliberation with analysis, vulnerability and tradeoff analysis, and
    strategy selection or problem reframing. It uses Exploratory Modeling (EM) to
    support this process through human/machine collaboration.
  47: The paper discusses Robust Decision Making (RDM) as a method for decision analysis
    under uncertainty, particularly using scenario thinking, robustness decision criteria,
    stress testing, and exploratory models. RDM often relies on scenario discovery
    and visualization, robust multi-objective optimization, integrated packages for
    exploratory modeling, and high-performance computing. Scenario Discovery (SD)
    algorithms begin with a large database of runs in which each model run represents
    the performance of a strategy in one future.

    to be taken if certain events occur, ensuring the plan remains on course.
  76: Dynamic Adaptive Planning (DAP), involving monitoring of specific indicators
    (e.g., passenger movements, aircraft movements, transfer rates, noise footprint),

    pathways map is based on the median values for ATP of actions for all plausible
    climate futures. The scorecard applies to the high-end scenario.
  95: Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) facilitates decision making by offering
    visualizations of policy options and encourages consideration of uncertainties
    and adaptations over time.
  96: The concept of tipping points is central to the DAPP method, which can include
    opportunity tipping points where actions become feasible or attractive due to
    factors like cost or technical developments.

    than optimization under high uncertainty, by prioritizing decisions that achieve
    critical goals despite uncertainties.
  108: This page describes a robust satisficing approach to decision-making under
    uncertainty, where candidate decisions are evaluated based on whether they satisfy
    performance requirements and how much the underlying model can change without
    violating those requirements. It prioritizes decisions that are more robust against
    uncertainty while still meeting the performance requirements.
  109: 'This section qualitatively explores robustness using five conceptual proxies:
    resilience, redundancy, flexibility, adaptiveness, and comprehensiveness, in the
    context of decision-making under uncertainty.'
  115: "Info-Gap Decision Theory (IG) is used to analyze the robustness of a system\
    \ to uncertainty. The robustness function, \u02C6h(xc), quantifies the greatest\
    \ value of the horizon of uncertainty (h) up to which a performance requirement\
    \ (xc) is met. It determines the trade-off between robustness and performance,\

  130: EOA differs from some approaches by delaying strategy definition until after
    exploration of the range of combinations.

    x is given by force divided by stiffness. The robustness function quantifies how
    much uncertainty (horizon h) can be tolerated before the displacement x falls
    below a critical value xc.
  116: The 'zeroing property' of info-gap robustness functions means that model predictions
    are not a good basis for planning decisions when facing deep uncertainty.
  117: The choice between prioritizing robustness or opportuneness depends on the
    decision-maker's risk aversion. Robustness guarantees a required outcome under
    the greatest uncertainty, while opportuneness enables an aspired outcome at the
    lowest uncertainty.
  123: Quantitative analysis of large and complicated systems can face algorithmic
    or numerical difficulties due to high dimensionality. There's a challenge in bridging
    the gap between quantitative and qualitative analysis.
  126: EOA is contrasted with Real Options Analysis (ROA), which assumes more accurate
    estimation of future uncertainties, is generally limited to analyzing a single
    option at a time, and aims to develop single monetary values for options.
  128: EOA recognizes that analysts face deep uncertainties when analyzing modern
    engineering systems, especially large-scale, interconnected technological developments.
  130: The example of airport development illustrates how premature framing can lead
    to overly simplistic visions of possibilities.
  133: EOA involves continuous monitoring of developments and readjusting strategies
    as needed, similar to a game of chess where players explore possible combinations
    and adapt their moves as the game evolves.  The analysis recommends immediate
    decisions based on the context and range of possibilities.
  134: Threshold values in EOA serve a similar function to that of the triggers or
    adaptation tipping points used in other DMDU approaches.
  140: Focus on flexibility in engineering design and real estate evaluation under
    uncertainty. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation is referenced (Colorado River Basin
    water supply study), which may have relevant information.
  148: The page focuses on water resource planning in the Colorado River Basin as
    a case study for using RDM to address climate change risks. It does not directly
    quantify macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes but rather focuses on water resource
    management strategies.
  150: The study focuses on water management in the Colorado River Basin and its vulnerability
    to climate change, but does not directly address macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes
    at a national level.
  151: The page details a method for designing and simulating adaptive strategies
    for water management in the Colorado River basin, but does not directly address
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  152: The analysis focuses on the Colorado River Basin and uses different signposts
    and triggers that lead to different investments being implemented.
  154: The study focuses on the Colorado River and its long-term streamflow as a driver
    of risk. The figures show the trade-offs between vulnerability, cost, and regret
    for different adaptation strategies.
  156: The example focuses on the Colorado River Basin. The 'vulnerabilities' referenced
    in the text seem to be related to shortfalls in water supply, but are not explicitly
    defined on this page.
  158: The Basin Study analysis evaluated four adaptive strategies and explored the
    trade-offs among them. The analysis considers the Colorado River Basin.
  159: The Paris Climate Accord's goals require coordinated technology investments,
    which face deep uncertainties.
  164: The 'c' and 'd' values are not fully defined, making interpretation challenging.
    The 10% cost threshold is explicitly noted as arbitrary.
  165: The analysis identifies combinations of uncertainties that signal a move from
    one policy option to another. The algorithm proceeds by listing valid moves, listing
    uncertainty conditions, searching for common uncertainty conditions, and identifying
    transition nodes.
  166: The analysis appears to focus on the policies under conditions of low elasticity
    of substitution and mentions suitability for higher elasticity of substitution
    futures.
  181: The workshop described involves the use of the presented decision-making flowchart
    to address adaptation. ISA is an acronym for an unspecified program and DAP refers
    to unspecified program activities.
  194: The study focuses on flood risk management at a regional level in New Zealand.
  195: Traditional flood management practices in New Zealand, relying heavily on structural
    protection like levees and designed under past climate conditions, are less well-suited
    to addressing climate change induced risk.
  196: The Greater Wellington Regional Council (GWRC) used the DAPP approach to examine
    the Hutt City flood scheme and whether the 1:440 ARI protection target could be
    maintained over 100 years.
  198: The success of DAPP implementation depends on factors like national and international
    reports signaling changing risk, flood manager's capability, embedded action research,
    Council interest, a trusted facilitator, an implementable theoretical approach,
    and support from the Regional Council and functional managers.
  200: "Relative impacts are indicated with \u2013 and +; - is negative impact and\
    \ + positive impact. All pathways have negative social impacts, as land has to\
    \ be purchased."
  201: Discussed a case study focused on flood risk management in Hutt City, involved
    community consultation and adaptive planning with signals to trigger future actions
    or reassessment.
  202: The case study was experimental in the New Zealand context, providing an opportunity
    to identify where further theoretical and methodological development might take
    place.
  203: The page discusses the importance of embedding DAPP within New Zealand's national
    coastal hazards and climate change guidance to address future uncertainties and
    improve decision-making.
  210: The paper emphasizes the uncertainty inherent in climate models and the need
    for robust policymaking approaches. The figure shows a comparison of sea surface
    variability as measured by satellite and predicted by a global circulation model,
    highlighting the challenges of accurate climate prediction due to limitations
    in resolution and incomplete data.
  220: The paper uses a latch design as an example of IG analysis.
  223: No relevant information
  232: The analysis uses a case study approach focused on LNG plant capacity and deployment
    strategies. It acknowledges that parameters such as discount rate could be treated
    as uncertain variables with associated distributions in an EOA analysis.
  235: "Economies of scale (lower \u03B1) favor larger fixed designs due to lower\
    \ average unit cost of capacity."
  238: The flexible strategy's target curve stochastically dominates that of the fixed
    design, indicating that it is better across the range of possible outcomes. The
    flexible strategy reduces the risk of large losses compared to the fixed design.
  241: The paper analyzes flexible modular design strategies, and the figures relate
    to some particular design scenario.
  243: 'This page primarily discusses Engineering Options Analysis (EOA) and its application
    to two case studies: a Liquid Natural Gas project in Australia and a water management
    infrastructure project in the Netherlands. While the page discusses economic performance
    and risk, it does not explicitly quantify macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes
    at a national level in the context of climate change adaptation. The focus is
    on project-level decision-making under uncertainty.'
  247: Focus is on design alternatives for the IJmuiden pumping station; specifically
    replacement designs under uncertain conditions. Design alternatives maintain the
    same minimum function-specific level of service throughout the planning horizon.
    Dutch federal law mandates the protection level (North Sea levels exceeded on
    average once every 10,000 years). Study used service levels consistent with the
    2013 North Sea Canal Water Accord.
  250: The physical performance module interacts with the economic evaluation module
    in an iterative process.
  251: The Proactive Flexible design enables relatively cheap expansions.
  252: The analysis compares Fixed, Reactive Adaptive, and Proactive Flexible design
    alternatives. The value of options grows with the degree of uncertainty about
    the future. The use of simulation in EOA allows for insights into the specific
    conditions under which one design is better than another.
  254: The analysis focuses on flood defense in the Netherlands, specifically the
    IJmuiden pumping station.
  265: The method (DS) aims to address uncertainties related to climate change by
    providing a framework for decision-making that isn't solely reliant on potentially
    conflicting climate projections. It allows for the use of different beliefs about
    future climate without stalling the process.
  268: Stochastic weather generators are emphasized as useful tools for maintaining
    physical relationships among climate variables during analysis.
  271: No relevant information
  279: The analysis focuses on the Upper Colorado and Arkansas River Basins, using
    streamflows and other plausible stressor scenarios to assess the performance of
    water resources systems.
  283: The analysis focuses on indoor water demand as a representative performance
    measure.
  288: The probabilities generated from the ensemble of projections are not intended
    to represent known probabilities of future climate change, but rather a quantitative
    representation of information contained in the ensemble; The case study considers
    Colorado climate change.
  331: The paper reflects a shift in thinking, from viewing climate change as a gradual,
    distant problem primarily addressed through mitigation, to recognizing the need
    for immediate adaptation strategies that address the increasing frequency of extreme
    events and potential economic consequences.
  333: The text emphasizes the political and public strategy rather than economic
    evaluations; high public trust in the government's flood risk management capabilities
    is noted.
  335: The Netherlands' Delta Programme provides a case study of adaptive delta management
    in the face of climate change uncertainty.
  337: The page primarily describes the organizational structure and processes involved
    in developing and implementing Adaptive Delta Management (ADM) in the Netherlands,
    with a focus on decision-making frameworks and stakeholder involvement. The approach
    aims to tailor adaptation strategies to specific themes and regions. Further development
    should not make it more complex.
  338: The paper discusses Adaptive Delta Management (ADM) in the context of the Dutch
    Delta Programme.
  350: Political process can be constructive if framed correctly; Early feedback is
    necessary for Phase I planning to avoid conflicts down the line.
  351: The regional subprogrammes are the major source of information on the implementation
    process. The planning of the implementation of the MAA system was too optimistic,
    and parts are still under construction. Criteria for determining if measures are
    sufficient to reach the goals of the Delta programme and the goals of the strategies
    need to be elaborated in more detail.
  355: The page primarily provides context on the authors and the Delta Programme
    in the Netherlands, rather than presenting direct analysis of macroeconomic or
    macro-fiscal risks and adaptation costs/benefits. The Delta Programme's work in
    Bangladesh and Manila Bay may be relevant for comparative analysis in a broader
    review, but are not analyzed here.
  358: The paper acknowledges the challenges in creating a taxonomy of DMDU approaches
    due to their flexibility and evolution over time. It aims to address this by focusing
    on the underlying building blocks.
  359: The paper emphasizes robustness of decisions in the face of various uncertainties
    and discusses robustness metrics related to policy option performance over a set
    of plausible futures. It references 'what-if' scenario thinking.
  377: The paper emphasizes the importance of interaction between analysts and policymakers
    to facilitate the diffusion of DMDU techniques.
  396: The paper frames the DMDU field and suggests a trajectory for its application
    to policy problems where traditional analytical approaches have been insufficient.
  400: The paper suggests improving existing DMDU approaches, providing further guidance
    on when and how to apply specific DMDU approaches, and broadening the scope of
    DMDU applications beyond climate change and water management to other policy issues
    faced with deep uncertainty, such as transportation, energy, security, health
    care, and spatial planning.
  403: This page is a correction notice for a chapter on Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways
    (DAPP). It only corrects the author affiliation and points to the updated chapter.
    It does not contain any analysis itself.
  404: Focuses on defining terms within the DMDU framework, emphasizing the importance
    of adapting policies before reaching the Adaptation Tipping Point due to implementation
    lead times.

    (red) regions of performance for indoor water supply reliability under Status
    Quo and Build-Out demand scenarios, with temperature change on the x-axis and
    precipitation change on the y-axis.
  286: The probability of unacceptable system performance is 0% without accounting
    for model correlation and 0.7% when correlations are accounted for.
  288: "Current system robust to climate changes with current water demand; Problematic\
    \ conditions: precipitation reduction > 20% and temperature increase >= 3\xB0\
    C; System vulnerable with increased water demand unless precipitation increases\
    \ substantially and temperature does not increase > 2\xB0C."
