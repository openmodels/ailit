Drivers of Risk:
  1: Variation of weather variables; increase in average temperatures
  2: Temperature shocks and inter-annual variation in weather variables impact macroeconomic
    outcomes.
  4: Weather shocks and climate change (temperature and precipitation variations)
    are the main drivers of risk considered.
  5: "Monthly weather data (temperature and precipitation). Future climate change\
    \ projections (temperature data at 0.0715\u25E6 resolution) from the regional\
    \ circulation model COSMO-CLM forced by the CMCC-CM global climate model, under\
    \ intermediate and worse-case Representative Concentration Pathways (4.5 and 8.5)."
  6: Temperature is the main driver of risk investigated.
  7: Temperature and Precipitation
  8: Temperature, Precipitation, Poverty (interaction term with temperature)
  9: Temperature and precipitation changes
  10: Temperature deviations (both positive and negative) and precipitation changes
    impact agricultural productivity and GDP per-capita growth.
  11: Temperature change is a core driver of risk for both GDP and agricultural GVA
    based on RCP scenarios.
  12: Climate change, specifically temperature increases under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5
    scenarios.
  13: Temperature changes driven by global warming impacting GDP and agricultural
    productivity.
  14: Temperature change is the primary driver of risk.
  16: Average temperature and precipitation deviations (positive and negative) from
    historical norms (moving averages of the past 30 years).
  17: Persistent increases in temperatures under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
Highlights:
  1: Considerable model uncertainty exists; statistically significant effects of temperature
    for both GDP and agricultural reaction function are from a levels specification,
    where temperature is included in a non-linear form while weather variables and
    economic outcomes enter in first differences; slight average effects for GDP per-capita,
    but important losses in agriculture are projected by the end of the century.
  2: Temperature shocks have non-linear level effects in Italy, predicting lower overall
    economic impact from global warming than some global estimates.
  4: Panel fixed effects models with quadratic temperature specifications capture
    a mix of short-run and long-run impacts, with the relative weights depending on
    the ratio of time-series variation in weather to cross-unit variation in climate.
  5: "Finds a smoothing non-linear and concave-in-temperature relationship between\
    \ economic outcomes and temperature, with a maximum around 12-14\xB0C. Productivity\
    \ increases as temperature increases, until the optimum, then declines with further\
    \ warming, particularly in agriculture. A simple test of non-linearity rejects\
    \ the linear specification at 1% significance level."
  6: Models including linear time trends perform poorly compared to models without
    them. The DJO1 and NPS specifications have the lowest RMSE for both GDP per capita
    and agricultural GVA per worker. Models that assume heterogeneity of weather effects
    by income level (DJO2 and KAHN2) are not preferred in out-of-sample prediction
    for agricultural productivity.
  7: It's difficult to discriminate between growth vs level models or between linear
    vs non-linear models in out-of-sample prediction, suggesting the existence of
    model uncertainty for Italian data. Linear temperature specification in growth
    rate is rejected by the data. A quadratic relationship between temperature and
    GDP is not statistically significant. The non-linear NPS model in levels performs
    well in cross-validation exercises.
  8: "Non-linear temperature specifications (quadratic) perform better than linear\
    \ specifications, particularly in levels models. There are heterogeneous effects\
    \ of temperature based on income (poor vs. rich provinces), although these are\
    \ not statistically significant when using two-way clustered standard errors for\
    \ the per-capita GDP. Optimal temperature for GDP growth in Italy is estimated\
    \ to be 17.5\xB0C, which is within the range of previous global studies, but higher\
    \ than the average temperature in Italy during the observed period."
  9: Temperature and precipitation have statistically significant effects on GVA per
    worker, and these effects can vary depending on poverty levels. The analysis also
    attempts to determine the temperature/precipitation that maximizes agricultural
    GVA growth.
  11: Non-linear NPS model captures most long-run effects; projected economic outcomes
    using conservative temperature estimates to account for exceeding historical temperature
    bounds.
  12: Climate change impacts vary geographically, with Northern provinces potentially
    experiencing slight GDP gains while Southern provinces face GDP losses. Agricultural
    sector faces much higher losses, especially in Southern Italy under RCP 8.5.
  13: Temperature changes will disproportionally affect Southern regions in Italy,
    with GDP per-capita and agricultural productivity losses; up to 35% productivity
    loss in agriculture in Southern provinces.
  14: Temperature changes are projected to have negative impacts on per-capita GDP
    and agricultural GVA per worker, with more severe impacts under RCP8.5 compared
    to RCP4.5. Southern regions may need to foster growth of economic activities other
    than agriculture.
  16: Positive deviations in temperature have a statistically significant positive
    impact on GDP per capita growth. The impact of temperature deviations (positive
    and negative) on both GDP per capita and agricultural GVA per worker growth rates
    are significantly different for poor provinces, and the interaction between negative
    deviations in temperature and being a poor province has a significant effect on
    GDP per capita growth
  17: Italy experiences up to 10.44% loss in GVA per worker by 2100 under RCP 8.5,
    with poor provinces facing as much as 13.87% loss.
Methodology:
  1: Panel of 110 provinces in Italy observed between 1980 and 2014; explores linear
    and non-linear effects of weather variables on economic outcomes; uses first differences;
    econometric analysis
  2: Uses modern panel data econometrics with a focus on inter-annual variation of
    weather variables at NUTS3 level in Italy, employing non-linear (quadratic) specifications.
  4: Panel fixed effects models are used, with a focus on distinguishing between short-run
    weather impacts and long-run climate effects. Models include linear and non-linear
    (quadratic) specifications for weather variables. The analysis covers 35 yearly
    observations from 1980 to 2014 for Italian NUTS3 provinces.
  5: "Uses the anomaly method (New et al., 2000; Mitchell and Jones, 2005; Brunetti\
    \ et al., 2012) to set up monthly weather data from each province over the 1980\u2013\
    2014 period. Employs high-resolution temperature (Brunetti et al., 2014) and precipitation\
    \ (Crespi et al., 2018) climatologies. Uses a weighted average of anomalies calculated\
    \ for neighboring series. Downscales modelled scenarios by means of observed records\
    \ to remove bias. Uses flexible fractional polynomial regression. Uses Cross Validation\
    \ (CV) exercises to assess model performance."
  6: Forecast cross-validation (CV) is used to evaluate the out-of-sample prediction
    accuracy of different models. The analysis uses five training windows beginning
    in 1981 and ending in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010, respectively, with test
    periods spanning five years following each training window. Backcast cross-validation
    is also used.
  7: The study uses out-of-sample forecast accuracy (RMSE) to compare different model
    specifications (linear vs. non-linear, levels vs. growth). Welch t-tests are used
    to test for statistically significant differences in RMSE between models. K-fold
    cross-validation is used, though it is acknowledged to ignore the time-series
    nature of the data. Econometric analysis uses static models with standard errors
    clustered by province and province/region-year.
  8: Panel data regressions with different specifications (linear and quadratic temperature
    functions, GDP growth and level effects), controlling for precipitation. Robust
    standard errors clustered within NUTS3 regions. The period of analysis is 1980
    to 2014.
  9: The study uses regression analysis with robust standard errors clustered within
    NUTS3 regions. The regressions include controls for precipitation (Table 5) or
    temperature (Table 6). Different specifications (DJO1, DJO2, BHM1, BHM2, NPS1,
    NPS2) are used, varying the functional form of temperature/precipitation (linear,
    quadratic), and whether growth or levels of GVA per-worker are analyzed.
  10: Analysis is performed using econometric models like the XTSPJ estimator and
    Kahn et al. (2019) ARDL model with fixed effects and half-panel Jackknife FE estimator
    to address weather variable exogeneity.
  11: Analysis using long-run dynamic growth model, NPS model for temperature effects,
    projections based on RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, modeled using COSMO-CLM and CMCC-CM.
  12: Econometric analysis using provincial-level data in Italy, examining the relationship
    between temperature and GDP/GVA, considering both linear and non-linear models.
    Projections are made for the end of the century (average between 2080 and 2100).
  13: Projections based on the COSMO-CLM model and the NPS econometric results; comparison
    between RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
  14: The projections are based on NPS econometric results. The non-linear panel methods
    capture a mix of short- and long-run effects and analysis focuses on the historical
    record.
  16: The analysis uses panel data regressions (xtreg and xtspj) with country fixed
    effects and country-specific trends. K-fold cross-validation is used to select
    the best model. Historical norms are calculated as 30-year moving averages. The
    long-run effects are calculated from the OLS estimates of short-run co-efficients,
    summing coefficients and accounting for lagged dependent variables.
  17: The analysis uses econometric estimates and specifications from Kahn et al.
    (2019), with GDP (2014) weighted averages at the province level.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on Italy and uses provincial-level data.
  2: Italy provides valuable context due to its climatic heterogeneity and economic
    development differences, allowing the study to simulate global study conditions
    at a regional level.
  4: The analysis assumes that GDP per capita and agricultural GVA per worker approximate
    optimized quantities by economic agents. The estimated impact of weather can be
    heavily influenced by adaptation to local climate if there are enough (small)
    spatial units with a continuum of (small) differences in climate between contiguous
    territorial units and the relation between outcome and weather is non-linear.
  5: The analysis focuses on Italian provinces (NUTS3 level). The study compares different
    model specifications to assess the linearity vs. non-linearity effect of weather
    variables, and their growth vs. levels effect on economic outcomes. Mentions using
    Cambridge Econometrics' Regional Database, based on Eurostat.
  6: The differences in RMSE across specifications are generally quite small.
  9: The study uses panel data and analyzes the effect of temperature and precipitation
    on GVA per worker, taking into account poverty levels. The notes clarify the statistical
    significance levels and the acronyms used for different model specifications.
  11: Projected economic impacts at the provincial level in Italy are aggregated to
    describe broader regional changes.
  12: The paper finds that failing to account for adaptation by farmers may understate
    the true impact of climate change, contrasting common critiques of panel data
    models.
  14: Results should be treated with caution given model uncertainty. Analysis may
    not capture extreme events that lie outside the historical range. Future research
    should explicitly model adaptation and better discriminate between growth vs level
    effects, as well as short vs long run effects.
  16: The 'poor' provinces are interacted with the temperature variables, but the
    definition of a poor province is only explained in the text. The standard errors
    are clustered by provinces. 'xtreg' means fixed effects estimator, 'xtspj' means
    half-panel jackknife fixed effects estimator of Chudik et al. (2018).
  17: The study highlights discrepancies in impacts between rich and poor provinces.

    average effects for GDP per-capita, but important losses in agriculture, due to
    a persistent increase in average temperatures under both the RCPs 4.5 and 8.5.
  2: Projections for 2100 suggest a small, insignificant effect on GDP per capita
    at the aggregate level, but significant losses of 10%-30% on agricultural GVA
    per-worker.
  4: Estimated temperature coefficients capture about 96% (4%) of the long-run (short-run)
    effects on GDP per capita and agricultural GVA per worker, ceteris paribus, based

    different models predicting GDP per capita and agricultural GVA per worker. The
    RMSE values range from 0.0147 to 0.0160 for GDP per capita and 0.0831 to 0.0871
    for agricultural GVA per worker, depending on the model specification.

    of GDP growth, respectively, and 2.96% and 4.19% of GVA per-worker in agriculture.
  8: "Impact of temperature changes on per-capita GDP and agricultural productivity\
    \ is quantified. Specifically, a 1\xB0C increase in temperature reduces agricultural\
    \ labor productivity by around 5% points in poor provinces (significant at 10%\
    \ level in DJO2 specification). Max GDP temperature is estimated at 17.5 degrees\
    \ Celsius with a 95% quantile range of 14.2-20.9 degrees Celsius."

    \ squared, and precipitation interacted with a poverty indicator, along with their\
    \ standard errors and significance levels. It also provides R-squared values,\
    \ number of observations, maximum GVA temperature/precipitation, and range."
  10: "Persistent annual rise of 0.01\xB0C above the historical norm decreases real\
    \ GDP per-capita growth by 0.019 percentage points per year; a 0.01\xB0C annual\
    \ decrease below the historical norm reduces agricultural GVA per-worker growth\
    \ by 0.223 percentage points per year."
