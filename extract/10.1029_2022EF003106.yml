Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in mean climate and changes in climate variability are both considered
    as drivers.
  2: Adverse weather conditions, climate extremes, multivariate or temporally compounding
    events, long-term trends of mean climate, and climate variability.
  3: The analysis considers climate variables such as maximum and minimum temperature,
    and total daily precipitation as drivers impacting soybean yields.
  4: Temperature and precipitation types are the primary climatic drivers considered.
  5: Trends in mean climate (temperature and precipitation), climate variability,
    total monthly precipitation, and average daily maximum temperature.
  6: Future climatic forcing conditions, differences in climate sensitivity to increasing
    CO2 concentrations, extreme weather events like the 2012 event.
  7: Drier conditions during the first and second months of the growing season, wetter
    conditions in the last month. Warmer conditions during the second and third months,
    colder in the first month, compared to the 2012 event.
  8: The 2012 analogs are linked to climatic conditions involving precipitation and
    temperature anomalies.
  9: Hot and dry climatic conditions during the soybean reproductive season are key
    drivers of extreme crop failures.
  10: Changes in climate variability, specifically focusing on local analogs and simultaneous
    analogs to the historical event of 2012, are explored.
  11: Monthly precipitation and temperature anomalies; Weather extremes; Deforestation
    in the Amazon associated with soybean expansion; Expansion of harvesting area
  12: Long-term mean effects of climate change; climate variability.
  13: The page references climate extremes, warming temperatures, hot-dry compound
    extremes, weather-induced events, droughts, and heatwaves as drivers impacting
    crop yields and streamflow.
Evaluation Overview:
  13: The page primarily focuses on crop yields, specifically wheat, soybean, and
    maize, and addresses crop failure events. It also touches upon streamflow prediction
    and soil wetness.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Simultaneous soybean failures in the Americas, focusing on events with similar
    or higher impacts than the 2012 event which led to global price increases.
  2: Crop yield variability and failures, specifically extreme simultaneous soybean
    failures in the Americas, such as the 2012 event.
  3: This page does not provide an overview of specific outcomes being evaluated,
    but mentions simulated and observed yields of soybeans in rainfed areas.
  4: Soybean yield losses are evaluated, defined as the difference between annual
    production and mean production from 2000-2015.
  5: Crop failures, specifically simultaneous soybean failures, and crop yield differences
    between model simulations and observed data are evaluated.
  6: Projected soybean yields with and without adaptation strategies.
  7: Soybean yield anomalies and production losses in the US, Brazil, and Argentina.
  8: The evaluation compares the frequency and average losses of country-level analogs
    with aggregated 2012 analogs for soybean productivity losses in the US, Brazil,
    and Argentina.
  9: Extreme crop failures in the main soybean production areas (US, Brazil, and Argentina)
    are evaluated in the context of global food security and international markets.
  10: The paper evaluates the risk of simultaneous soybean failures in the USA, Brazil,
    and Argentina.
  11: Soybean yields and production
  12: Extreme soybean losses in the Americas.
Highlights:
  1: Long-term trends in mean climate increase the frequency and magnitude of simultaneous
    soybean failures. Changes in climate variability increase country-level failures
    but not simultaneous failures. Adaptation to long-term mean trends may reduce
    the future risk of simultaneous losses.
  2: The study aims to determine whether the risk of extreme soybean failures across
    the Americas is changing due to climate change, disentangling changes in mean
    climate change from changes in climate variability.
  4: The study adopts the concept of impact analogs to assess the future risk of soybean
    failures and investigates the associated climatic conditions and spatial distributions
    of these analogs.
  5: The hybrid model outperforms other models based on R^2, MAE, and RMSE metrics
    when analyzing the three countries (likely US, Brazil, and Argentina based on
    the map focus) together and individually. The hybrid model also has the lowest
    sum of absolute errors for simulating the 2012 extreme event. Adding direct climatic
    information to the process-based model output improves performance on the grid
    cell scale.
  6: Adaptation significantly reduces the number and magnitude of future events analogous
    to the 2012 soybean yield losses. Trends in mean climate dominate the risk of
    2012 analogs to occur.
  7: The expected damages associated with 2012 analogs are shown to increase in the
    three countries when compared to the 2012 event. Climatic conditions leading to
    extreme impacts can vary significantly, highlighting the usefulness of impact
    analogs.
  8: The US experiences the highest number of country-level analogs, and the study
    does not identify 2012 analogs coinciding with simultaneous country-level analogs
    in all three countries.
  9: Long-term effects of climate change significantly increase the frequency and
    magnitude of yield anomalies. Successful adaptation to changes in mean climate
    can minimize the majority of climate change-caused impacts on simultaneous soybean
    failures across the Americas.
  10: Failures in the three countries is not expected to significantly increase due
    to changes in climate variability alone; joint analysis of crop yield anomalies
    in each of the important growing regions is necessary to robustly assess future
    risk of simultaneous soybean failures.
  11: Analyzes the impact of climate variability on soybean yields, considering both
    precipitation and temperature anomalies.
  12: Increase of risk of simultaneous extreme soybean losses is primarily driven
    by the long-term mean effects of climate change; change in the joint occurrence
    of extreme soybean losses in the Americas due to climate variability is not evident
    from our simulations; successful adaptation measures to mean climate change can
    help minimize the increase of risk of simultaneous extreme soybean losses in the
    Americas.
  13: The page highlights the underestimation of yield responses to droughts and heatwaves
    by global gridded crop models, the influence of extreme weather disasters on global
    crop production, and the importance of conserving biomes to protect the soy economy.
Methodology:
  1: A hybrid model, coupling a process-based crop model with a machine learning model,
    is developed to improve the simulation of soybean production. Anomalies are evaluated
    with respect to present day and future conditions to disentangle the impacts of
    (changing) climate variability from the long-term mean trends.
  2: 'Develops a hybrid model to link weather conditions to crop yields and adopts
    the concept of impact analogs to identify events in the future with similar or
    larger impacts than the 2012 event. Analyzes the contribution of trends in mean
    climate and trends in climate variability. Analyzes two baseline scenarios: one
    static and one accounting for trends in mean climate and crop yield.'
  3: "The methodology involves using climate data, simulated yields from a crop model,\
    \ and observed yields to build a hybrid model assessing the impact of climate\
    \ on rainfed soybeans. It uses data resampled to a 0.5\xB0 x 0.5\xB0 grid and\
    \ considers CO2 fertilization effects."
  4: A hybrid model combining simulated soybean yields from EPIC-IIASA and climate
    indices is built and calibrated to observed yields using a multilayer perceptron
    (MLP). A dynamic calendar based on the reproductive stage of soybeans is used
    to define a 3-month season most sensitive to weather disruptions.
  6: Uses a hybrid model to simulate soybean yields at the grid cell scale. Investigates
    the total number of analog events of the 2012 event for both adaptation and no
    adaptation scenarios under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5.
  7: Spatial analysis of nine impact analogs in the adaptation scenario to determine
    losses in each country. 'Country-level analogs' explore the risks associated with
    soybean failures in each country, using a different selection of years than the
    aggregated 2012 analogs.
  9: Climate model simulations driven by future emission scenarios are used with a
    hybrid model to simulate the effects of climate conditions on yields. An impact
    perspective is adopted, using extreme crop losses as a starting point.
  10: The analysis uses Global Gridded Crop Models (GGCMs) (GFDL-esm4, IPSL-cm6a-lr,
    UKESM1-0-ll) under different SSP scenarios (1-2.6, 5-8.5) to project events related
    to crop yield anomalies from 2020 to 2100.
  11: Uses soybean harvest areas documented for 2012 throughout all simulations, focusing
    on rainfed harvest areas based on 2010 data; Scenarios include 'adaptation' and
    'no adaptation' cases where long-term trends are removed in the adaptation scenario;
    Three GCMs are selected with different climate sensitivities and two extreme SSP
    scenarios
  12: Simulations; Use of historic events (such as the 2012 aggregated crop yield
    failure).
  13: The page mentions the use of machine learning combined with biophysical models,
    global gridded crop models, statistical models, crop modeling, trend-preserving
    bias adjustment, and statistical downscaling.
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on the US, Brazil, and Argentina, which are responsible for
    80% of global soybean production.
  5: The analysis focuses on soybean yields.
  6: The study highlights the importance of adaptation strategies in mitigating the
    impacts of climate change on soybean production. The choice of Global Climate
    Model (GCM) impacts results. The 2012 event saw losses of 7.2 Mt in the US, 4.9
    Mt in Brazil and 9 Mt in Argentina.
  7: The number of country-level analogs of the 2012 event is 3.4, 4.4, and 9.3 times
    higher for Argentina, Brazil and Argentina (31, 40, respectively).
  9: The paper distinguishes between increased risk due to changes in mean climate
    and increased risk due to changes in climate variability, highlighting the need
    for different adaptation responses.
  10: The study makes specific assumptions on concepts and boundary conditions accounting
    for the adaptation of crop management practices to mean climate trends.
  11: The study acknowledges limitations such as not accounting for expansion of harvesting
    areas or irrigation areas, and suggests future work could include socioeconomic
    models to analyze land use change, poverty vulnerability and impacts on global
    hunger through international trade.
  12: Data and code are publicly available at the provided DOIs.
  13: The page includes references to specific datasets and software used in climate
    and crop modeling, suggesting a focus on data-driven and model-based analyses.
    Several studies analyze the impact of climate change on agriculture in specific
    regions, such as southeastern Australia and Brazil.
Quantitative Material:
  13: The page references percent changes in crop yield variability and mentions studies
    focusing on quantifying the impacts of climate change on specific crops like soybean
    and maize.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Long-term trends in mean climate increase the frequency of 2012 analogs by 11\u2013\
    16 times and the magnitude by 4\u201315% compared to changes in climate variability\
    \ only depending on the global climate scenario."
  4: The study uses the coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
    and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance. The analysis
    identifies '2012 analogs' based on years with larger negative yield anomalies
    than observed in 2012.
  5: Coefficient of Determination (R^2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE, ton/ha), Root Mean
    Squared Error (RMSE, ton/ha) are used to evaluate model performance.  The hybrid
    model obtains the lowest sum of absolute errors for the 2012 event, with 88% and
    22% error reduction with respect to the Stat-EPIC and Stat-clim models, respectively.
  6: In the no adaptation scenario, SSP5-8.5 estimates 82 annual yield values at or
    below the 2012 yield; SSP1-2.6 estimates 43. Mean production losses are 17% larger
    than the original event for SSP5-8.5 and 6% for SSP1-2.6. Adaptation scenario
    shows nine analogs in the future scenarios (4 for SSP1-2.6 and 5 for SSP5-8.5).
    Losses are 2.3% and 2.2% larger than 2012 event under adaptation for SSP5-8.5
    and SSP1-2.6 respectively. Analogs are 11 and 16 times more likely in the no adaptation
    scenario than in the adaptation scenario for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5. Magnitude
    is 4% and 15% higher in no adaptation for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 respectively.
  7: Compared to the 2012 event, analog losses increase on average by -1.5 Mt (-4.1
    Mt, 1.0 Mt) in the US, -0.5 Mt (-5.9 Mt, 4.8 Mt) in Brazil, and -0.6 Mt (-4.0
    Mt, 2.8 Mt) in Argentina.
  8: Average losses for country-level analogs increase by approximately -2.7 Mt in
    the US, -2.5 Mt in Brazil, and -2.4 Mt in Argentina compared to the 2012 event.
  9: The occurrence of impacts analogous to the 2012 event increases both in terms
    of frequency and magnitude of yield anomalies under high-emission levels. Risk
    of 2012 analogs is roughly 11 and 16 times less frequent and on average 4% and
    15% less intense for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively, under an adaptation
    scenario.
