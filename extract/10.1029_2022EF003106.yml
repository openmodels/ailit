Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, specifically changes in mean climate and climate variability
    (anomalous hot and dry conditions).
  5: Trends in mean climate, climate variability, weather-induced crop failures
  6: Future climatic forcing conditions heavily impact the occurrence of analog events
    similar to the 2012 soybean yield loss.
  7: Climate change impacts, specifically drier and warmer conditions compared to
    historical climatology, leading to soybean failures.
  8: Climatic conditions (precipitation and temperature anomalies) leading to regional
    and aggregated soybean failures.
  9: Climate change, particularly compounding hot and dry conditions during the soybean
    reproductive season, and both changes in mean climate and changes in climate variability.
  10: Changes in climate variability and specific climate models (GFDL-esm4, IPSL-cm6a-lr,
    UKESM1-0-ll) under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs 1-2.6 and 5-8.5)
    are the primary drivers.
  11: Climate sensitivities, extreme SSP scenarios, uncertainty in the occurrence
    and magnitude of extreme events, deforestation associated with soybean expansion,
    and weather extremes impacting rainfed harvest areas are considered.
  12: Long-term mean effects of climate change and, regionally, changes in climate
    variability.
Highlights:
  1: Long-term trends in mean climate significantly increase the risk of simultaneous
    soybean failures in the Americas. Adaptation measures targeting these long-term
    trends may reduce the future risk of such failures.
  5: The hybrid model outperforms other models (EPIC-IIASA, Stat-EPIC, Stat-clim)
    in simulating crop yields (based on the metrics considered). The hybrid model
    reduces error compared to other models when simulating the 2012 event
  6: Adaptation scenarios reduce the likelihood of severe yield loss events by approximately
    11 to 16 times compared to no adaptation scenarios.
  7: Expected damages associated with 2012 analogs are shown to increase in the US,
    Brazil, and Argentina when compared to the 2012 event.
  8: Country-level analogs are more frequent than aggregated analogs in the future,
    and their average losses are increasing compared to 2012. The US shows the highest
    number of country-level analogs. Simultaneous soybean losses across the three
    countries are complex, with 2012 analogs often occurring due to one or two countries
    experiencing country-level analogs.
  9: Long-term effects of climate change significantly increase the risk of extreme
    soybean failures; adaptation to changes in mean climate can substantially minimize
    these impacts; the study highlights the importance of distinguishing between changes
    in mean climate and changes in climate variability for adaptation planning.
  10: The study suggests that failures in soybean production in the three countries
    considered are not expected to increase significantly due to changes in climate
    variability alone. Joint analysis of crop yield anomalies in each of the important
    growing regions is necessary to robustly assess the future risk of simultaneous
    soybean failures.
  11: The study focuses on how climate variability, particularly precipitation and
    temperature anomalies, affects soybean yields in the US, Brazil, and Argentina.
  12: Increase of risk of simultaneous extreme soybean losses is primarily driven
    by the long-term mean effects of climate change; Adaptation measures to mean climate
    change can help minimize the increase of risk of simultaneous extreme soybean
    losses in the Americas; The difference in impacts to changes in mean climate and
    changes in climate variability is large, and so are their potential adaptation
    options.
Methodology:
  1: Uses a hybrid crop model, coupling a process-based crop model with a machine
    learning model, to simulate soybean production and assess the frequency and magnitude
    of extreme crop failures under different future climate scenarios. It assesses
    anomalies with respect to present day and future conditions.
  5: Comparison of models for simulating crop yields under different climate scenarios
    (no adaptation and adaptation). The 'no adaptation' scenario includes the influence
    of both long-term trends in mean climate and in climate variability. The 'adaptation'
    scenario considers future yields relative to future baselines (trends in mean
    climate are not considered), simulating complete agricultural adaptation to changes
    in mean climate. A hybrid model is designed to simulate crop yield variability
  6: The study uses Global Gridded Crop Models to simulate soybean yields under different
    climate scenarios to assess the impact of adaptation versus no adaptation.
  7: The study uses 'impact analogs' to assess losses in each country under an adaptation
    scenario, comparing them to the 2012 event and historical climatology. The spatial
    analysis considers nine impact analogs.
  8: The paper compares the occurrence of country-level analogs with the occurrence
    of 2012 analogs (aggregated across all countries) to identify co-occurrences of
    regional and aggregated soybean failures. It uses climatic data (precipitation
    and temperature) to find analog years to the 2012 event. Applicable to soybean
    yields in the US, Brazil, and Argentina.
  9: Uses climate model simulations driven by future emission scenarios and a hybrid
    model to simulate the effects of climate conditions on yields, focusing on extreme
    crop losses rather than climate variables as the starting point.
  10: The study uses Global Gridded Crop Models (GGCMs) in combination with SSPs to
    project future crop yield outcomes. The analysis considers the joint analysis
    of crop yield anomalies in important growing regions.
  11: Uses soybean harvest areas documented for 2012 and focuses on rainfed harvest
    areas based on data from 2010. Employs three GCMs with different climate sensitivities
    and two extreme SSP scenarios. Removes long-term trends in the 'adaptation scenario,'
    and CO2 fertilization effects are not considered in the 'no adaptation scenario'.
    The analysis focuses on soybean yields.
  12: Simulations; Use of historic events (such as the 2012 aggregated crop yield
    failure) as a framework.
More Notes:
  1: The study highlights the vulnerability of the global soybean supply chain due
    to the concentration of production in the US, Brazil, and Argentina. It differentiates
    the impacts of changes in mean climate vs. changes in climate variability, finding
    the former to be the dominant driver of simultaneous failures. The study suggests
    adaptation to long-term climate trends as a key strategy to mitigate future risks.
  5: 'The hybrid model uses total monthly precipitation and average daily maximum
    temperature as input variables. The paper uses two hypothetical scenarios: (a)
    ''no adaptation'' and (b) ''adaptation''. The study focuses on soybean yields'
  7: The analysis highlights the variability in climatic conditions leading to extreme
    impacts, suggesting that different weather anomalies can result in similar outcomes.
    The paper distinguishes between simultaneous soybean failures (aggregated 2012
    analogs) and country-level analogs.
  9: The paper focuses on the combined impact on soybean production in the US, Brazil,
    and Argentina, analyzing both aggregated and country-level effects.
  10: "The study acknowledges that it makes specific assumptions and boundary conditions\
    \ and considers adaptation of crop management practices to mean climate trends.\
    \ The study does not explore the relationship between yield losses and large teleconnections\
    \ like ENSO, although acknowledges that La Ni\xF1a phases may affect soybean yields\
    \ in different ways in different countries."
  11: The paper acknowledges limitations such as not considering the expansion of
    harvesting areas and expansion of irrigation areas. Sampling uncertainty in extreme
    events is addressed using large ensembles.

    event, soybean losses increase by -1.5 Mt (-4.1 Mt, 1.0 Mt) in the US, -0.5 Mt
    (-5.9 Mt, 4.8 Mt) in Brazil, and -0.6 Mt (-4.0 Mt, 2.8 Mt) in Argentina.

    15% less intense for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively; Figure 5 indicates average
    production anomaly for US is around -2.0 megatonnes, Brazil is slightly above
    -2.0 megatonnes, and Argentina is slightly less than -2.5 megatonnes.
