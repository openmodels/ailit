Drivers of Risk:
  1: Anthropogenic warming and population growth; increased frequency, severity, and
    spatiotemporal extent of extreme temperature and humidity.
  3: Increase in heat stress (HS) quantified based on the U.S. National Weather Service
    recommended heat index (HI), driven by changes in temperature (Tmax) and relative
    humidity (RH) under climate change scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Population changes
    also contribute to total health risks.
  5: Extreme heat stress (HS) events of varying durations (1, 3, and 7 days) under
    five different climate scenarios; changes in HS characteristics (40-year return
    values of annual extreme summer HS events (40YHI) and decadal trends in warm tail
    spread (WTS)).
  6: Extreme Heat Stress (HS)
  8: Increases in temperature and absolute humidity exacerbate heat stress due to
    a nonlinear relationship and reduced physiological cooling capacity. The RCP8.5
    emission scenario leads to significant increases in heat stress severity.
  11: Climate change (specifically, increases in 40YHI (a heat stress characteristic)
    and trends in WTS (another heat stress characteristic) combined with population
    changes) drive increased risk of potential impact (PI) of high-end summer heat
    stress (HS) events.
  12: The risk of population impact (PI) is influenced by both short and long duration
    extreme heat stress and population growth, particularly in certain regions of
    the CONUS.
Highlights:
  1: "Potential impact of short-to-medium duration (1\u20137 days) heat stress (HS)\
    \ is likely to double in the US by 2060\u20132099; climate change alone more than\
    \ doubles the impact in the coastal Pacific Northwest, central California, and\
    \ the Great Lakes region."
  3: The study decomposes the relative importance of climate and population changes
    for limiting total health risks in each region of the Continental US (CONUS).
  5: The potential impact of summer extreme HS events is estimated by combining population
    exposure with HS characteristics (40YHI and decadal trends in WTS) for different
    climate scenarios and HS durations.
  8: Extreme heat stress severity is projected to increase significantly across CONUS,
    particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, Southeast Atlantic coastal regions, East,
    Midwest, and Great Plains, under RCP8.5.
  11: The risk of potential impact (PI) of high-end summer heat stress events is likely
    to increase significantly in the future, particularly under the RCP8.5-SSP5 scenario,
    due to the combined effects of climate change and population dynamics. The increase
    in RR is greatest in the RCP8.5-SSP5 far-future scenario for 1-day and 3-day heat
    stress events.
  12: A substantial increase in the risk of population impact due to extreme heat
    has been identified in parts of the CONUS, largely driven by global-mean warming
    and population growth.
Methodology:
  1: Using observations, climate projections from the CMIP5 model ensemble, and historical
    and future population estimates, we apply the IPCC risk framework to examine present
    and projected future potential impact (PI) of summer heat stress for the contiguous
    United States (CONUS) as a function of non-stationary HS characteristics and population
    exposure.
  3: "Uses climate model simulations from nine global climate models (GCMs) participating\
    \ in the CMIP5 experiment. Employs a bias correction technique (Wang & Chen, 2014)\
    \ to adjust model-calculated HI for the historical period (1979\u20132005) to\
    \ match reanalysis data. Regrids and extracts datasets at 2\xB0 spatial resolutions\
    \ within the CONUS region. Uses GPWv4 population data at a 1 km resolution."
  5: Indicator-based assessment technique to determine a composite indicator for potential
    impact (PI) of HS, based on IPCC's framework of impacts, adaptations, and vulnerability.
    This includes defining indicator variables (population exposure, 40YHI, and WTS),
    and aggregating these indicators to estimate PI for CONUS grid points.
  6: The study uses a decision matrix based on indicator variables for each grid location
    in the CONUS and each climate scenario. It employs geometric aggregation of normalized
    variables to estimate a composite indicator for Potential Impact (PI). The min-max
    normalization method is used to scale indicator variables between 0 and 1. Risk
    ratios (RR) are calculated to quantify changes in PI.
  8: Uses daily maximum Heat Index (HI) to estimate annual maximum magnitude of summer
    extreme heat stress (HS) severity. Uses 3- and 7-day rolling averages for medium
    and longer duration events.  Future projections are based on the model-ensemble
    average from 9 CMIP5 global-climate models (GCMs) and bias-corrected. Analyzes
    historical and projected heat stress severity for CONUS under different RCP scenarios.
    Examines 40-year return levels for heat stress (40YHI).
  11: Examines changes in population exposure to heat stress indicators (40YHI, WTS)
    under different RCP-SSP scenarios (RCP4.5-SSP2 and RCP8.5-SSP5). The risk of potential
    impact (PI) is investigated based on relative risk (RR). The analysis is based
    on census regions within the CONUS.
  12: The analysis uses the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) approach to evaluate the
    severity and temporal variability of heat stress relative to local climate and
    population patterns.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on heat stress in the contiguous United States (CONUS).
  3: The study focuses on heat stress and its impacts, which are related to health
    risks and could potentially translate into economic impacts (e.g., productivity
    loss, healthcare costs) but this link is not made on this page.
  5: The study focuses on the Continental United States (CONUS). The analysis uses
    non-stationary frequency analysis to assess health risk from extreme heat events.
    The best-fit GEV models are selected based on the Bayesian Information Criteria
    (BIC) and Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT).
  11: Climate models may not faithfully capture slower-moving Rossby waves in the
    Northeast, leading to uncertainty in projections for that region.

Quantitative material:
  1: "Potential impact of short-to-medium duration (1\u20137 days) HS events is likely\
    \ to increase more than three-fold across densely populated regions of the U.S.\
    \ including the Northeast, Southeast Piedmont, Midwest, and parts of the Desert\
    \ Southwest by late this century (2060\u20132099) under the highest emissions\
    \ scenario; climate change alone more than doubles the impact in the coastal Pacific\
    \ Northwest, central California, and the Great Lakes region."
  3: Mentions the use of daily maximum air temperature (Tmax) and daily mean relative
    humidity (RH) data, and specific humidity (q) and surface pressure (Ps) for calculations.
    It also specifies historical period 1979-2019, future projections from 2006 to
    2100.
  5: Calculation of 40-year return values of annual extreme summer HS events; decadal
    trends in the spread of the warm tail (WTS); population exposure for different
    durations of HS events under five climate scenarios.
  8: "Under RCP8.5, 1day-HS (7days-HS) severity increases result in HI values up to\
    \ 3.6\xB0C (2.5\xB0C), and up to 6\xB0C (4.6\xB0C) warmer than the measured air\
    \ temperature by the end of the century."
  11: Risk of PI could increase more than 3x in the northern Midwest, coastal Pacific
    Northwest, central California, and northern Utah under the RCP8.5-SSP5 emission
    scenario, and 2.5x in the Southeast Piedmont, northern Texas, and portions of
    the Southwest.
