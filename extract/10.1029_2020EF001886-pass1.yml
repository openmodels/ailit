Drivers of Risk:
  1: Anthropogenic warming and population growth as key drivers of increased heat
    stress.
  2: The paper identifies potential changes in atmospheric dynamics, extreme heat
    events, and variability in temperature and humidity as drivers of risk.
  3: The drivers of risk are daily maximum air temperature (Tmax) and daily mean relative
    humidity (RH), which are used to calculate the heat index.  Climate change scenarios
    RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are also used.
  4: The drivers of risk are extreme heat events, specifically 1-, 3-, and 7-day heat
    stress events, influenced by climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Future population
    projections (SSP2 and SSP5) also drive risk.
  5: The page discusses the impact of summer extreme heat stress (HS) events and their
    potential risks, especially in areas with large socioeconomic vulnerabilities.
  6: The drivers of risk are represented by three indicator variables at each grid
    location of the CONUS under 5 climate scenarios, aggregated into a composite indicator.
  7: Projections of extreme heat stress using historical observations and CMIP5 modeled
    scenarios highlight the impact of climate change.
  8: The primary drivers of risk are increasing temperatures and absolute humidity,
    which exacerbate heat stress due to the non-linear relationship between these
    factors and the HI. The study uses RCP8.5 emission scenarios to project future
    heat stress severity.
  9: Changes in 40-year heat index (40YHI), summer warming, and trends in warm temperature
    sum (WTS) of daily summer heat stress severity.
  10: Climate change and population changes, specifically examining the effects of
    different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) and Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSP) on heat-related health risks.
  11: The analysis considers the effects of climate change (represented by RCP4.5
    and RCP8.5 emission scenarios) and socioeconomic pathways (SSP2 and SSP5) on heat
    stress indicators.
  12: Key drivers of increased risk include global-mean warming and population growth
    in specific regions.
Evaluation overview:
  1: "Potential impact of short-to-medium duration (1\u20137 days) heat stress likely\
    \ to triple across densely populated regions of the U.S. by late this century."
  2: This page discusses the outcome of extreme heat events, focusing on health impacts
    such as heat-related mortality and morbidity.
  3: The study evaluates heat stress (HS) quantified using the U.S. National Weather
    Service recommended heat index (HI). It aims to identify targeted strategies for
    limiting total health risks.
  4: This study evaluates high-end heat stress (HS) severity, focusing on the magnitude
    of the 40-year return value of the Heat Index (HI).
  6: The study evaluates a composite indicator for Potential Impact (PI) of extreme
    Heat Stress (HS).
  8: The study evaluates the severity of extreme heat stress (HS) using the daily
    maximum Heat Index (HI). It explores short, medium (3-day rolling average), and
    long (7-day rolling average) duration events, focusing on their impact and potential
    for increased mortality.
  9: Changes in population exposure and extreme summer heat stress (HS) characteristics.
  10: Heat-related health outcomes across the contiguous United States.
  11: Changes in population exposure to heat stress (HS) characteristics, and risk
    of potential impact (PI) of high-end summer HS events are evaluated.
  12: The paper evaluates the increase in risk of personal injury (PI) due to extreme
    heat stress (HS) across the continental U.S. (CONUS).
Highlights:
  1: Heat stress likely to double in the coastal Pacific Northwest, central California,
    and Great Lakes region due to climate change alone by late century.
  2: The study finds that recent increases in HS coincide with high socio-economic
    vulnerability in parts of the U.S.
  3: The study decomposes the relative importance of climate and population changes
    to identify targeted strategies for limiting total health risks in each region.
  4: The study estimates the 40YHI for different durations (1-, 3-, and 7-days) using
    a non-stationary GEV framework, considering various climate scenarios and future
    time periods.
  9: Relatively higher rate of increase in WTS across the Great Lakes in the RCP8.5
    (far-future) scenario. Decrease in the trends in WTS are likely in the far-future
    (relative to the near-future) in the RCP4.5 scenarios.
  10: Climate change and demographic shifts are expected to impact heat-related health
    risks across different U.S. regions, with variability across different emission
    scenarios and time periods.
  11: A considerably larger population is likely to be exposed to more severe 40YHI
    in future decades, particularly under the RCP8.5-SSP5 scenario. Simultaneous increases
    in HS characteristics and population exposure indicate a likely amplification
    in the PI of HS events over the CONUS in the RCP8.5-SSP5 scenario.
  12: A substantial increase in risk of PI is identified from short and long-duration
    extreme HS, especially in parts of the Pacific Northwest, central California,
    Midwest, Northeast, Southeastern Piedmont, coastal Pacific Northwest, Texas, Utah,
    and California.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis integrates observations, climate projections from the CMIP5 model ensemble,
    and historical and future population estimates using the IPCC risk framework.
  2: The analysis uses climate change risk assessment combining CMIP5 projections
    and shared socioeconomic pathways to assess HS impact in the U.S.
  3: "The HI is calculated based on the algorithm discussed in Anderson G. Brooke\
    \ et al., 2013, using daily Tmax and RH data. Historical data (1979-2019) are\
    \ based on CPC and ERA5 reanalysis data. Model simulations use nine GCMs from\
    \ CMIP5. A bias correction technique (Wang & Chen, 2014) is applied to model-calculated\
    \ HI for the historical period (1979-2005) to match reanalysis data.  RH for GCMs\
    \ is derived from specific humidity (q) and surface pressure (Ps) using the equation\
    \ provided. Data are regridded to 2\xB0 spatial resolution within the CONUS region.\
    \  Population estimates from GPWv4 are used, with 2015 data used for years where\
    \ data isn't available."
  4: "The analysis uses a non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) framework\
    \ applied to annual maxima of summer Heat Index (AM-HI). The GEV model incorporates\
    \ linear and non-linear time trends in the location (\xB5) and scale (\u03C3)\
    \ parameters to account for non-stationarity, while keeping the shape (\u03BE\
    ) parameter constant. Block Maxima (BM) method is used to restrict attention to\
    \ the yearly maxima. SSP2 and SSP5 population data is used to represent current\
    \ and future populations. Population estimates are linearly interpolated to obtain\
    \ annual values."
  5: The analysis involves a combination of indicator-based assessment techniques
    and GEV models to estimate potential impacts of summer extreme HS under different
    climate scenarios.
  6: A decision matrix is formed using three indicator variables for each grid location
    and climate scenario. A composite indicator is estimated using geometric aggregation
    of normalized variables (min-max normalization from 0 to 1) with equal weights.
    The Risk Ratio (RR) is then calculated.
  7: Analysis uses Relative Risk (RR) concept to investigate changes in probability
    of heat stress exposure due to climate and population change.
  9: Analysis of bivariate distribution of 40YHI and population estimates for the
    CONUS in five climate scenarios. Examination of decadal trends in WTS. Comparisons
    across RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.
  10: Analysis projects the Total Effect, Climate Change Effect, and Population Effect
    on heat-related health risks under various RCP and SSP scenarios in the near-future
    (mid-century) and far-future (end-century). Regional analysis is performed for
    the West, Midwest, Northeast, and South regions.
  11: The analysis uses mean population estimates for near- and far-future periods
    under SSP2 and SSP5. Changes are investigated based on the baseline fixed to the
    2015 CONUS population. The indicators for HS characteristics are 40YHI and WTS
    (metrics not explicitly defined on this page).
  12: The analysis uses a generalized extreme value (GEV) approach to evaluate changes
    in distribution positions and shapes related to extreme heat exposure.
More Notes:
  3: The study focuses on the CONUS region.
  4: The study focuses on the CONUS region. The analysis considers historical (1980-2019),
    near-future (2020-2059), and far-future (2060-2099) time periods. The selection
    of SSP2 and SSP5 scenarios reflect the moderate and highest socio-economic challenges
    that extreme heat may pose for mitigation and adaptation.
  9: The spatial pattern of 40YHI matches closely to that of 40YTx (likely a temperature
    metric) in the western CONUS, where the impact of humidity is negligible.
  10: The analysis uses maps and box plots to visualize and compare the projected
    impacts across different scenarios, time frames, and regions.
  11: The climate models used in the CMIP5 multi-model simulations may be unable to
    faithfully capture certain climate phenomena (the authors do not go into detail
    on what those phenomena are).
  12: The paper emphasizes that integrating determinants of vulnerability such as
    population density by age group, underlying health conditions, and socioeconomic
    status is crucial.

    exposure to specific trend magnitudes.
  10: Relative risk (RR) increases due to heat are quantified using color scales on
    maps and percentage change in RR is shown in box plots for different scenarios,
    time frames, and regions.
  11: The analysis indicates more than 3x likely increase in risk of PI due to the
    total effect of climate and population changes in the northern Midwest, coastal
    Pacific Northwest, central California, and northern Utah under the RCP8.5-SSP5
    emission scenario, and a 2.5x increase in the Southeast Piedmont, northern Texas,
    and portions of the Southwest. The authors present RRs (relative risk) based on
    total effect, climate change only, and population only.
  12: The risk of PI is projected to more than double in certain areas due to population
    growth alone.
