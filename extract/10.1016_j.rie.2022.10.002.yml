Drivers of Risk:
  4: "Climate-related anomaly (ki,t), cultural connection with homeland, (kappa1ij),\
    \ and armed conflict (\u03D1i,t) are drivers influencing migration. Migration\
    \ inflows impact government policy. Spatial distance and diaspora size are drivers\
    \ of migration costs."
  5: Business cycle changes (economic recovery or downturn) drive migration flows,
    which in turn affect GDP.
  6: Climate change (rising temperatures, natural disasters)
  7: Wars (internal and external conflicts).
  8: Temperature anomaly and armed conflicts are key drivers affecting migration volumes,
    with temperature anomalies reducing asylum-associated migration and armed conflicts
    significantly increasing it.
Highlights:
  4: Governments react to migration inflows, diaspora size, and GDP when setting migration
    policies. Migration costs decrease with diaspora size and increase with spatial
    distance.
  5: Economic recovery (positive business cycle) increases immigration due to higher
    expected income and a more relaxed policy environment. Stricter migration policies
    can be relaxed by a boosting business cycle.
  6: There is a threshold where the contribution of GDP expansion is large enough
    that immigration increases; rising temperature can bring advantages for nations
    in colder zones in terms of more productive agriculture; marginal effect of domestic
    climates on migration may be positive, but it may not be positive if the yields
    deceed the insurance premium
  8: A temperature anomaly decreases asylum-associated migration by about 26%, while
    diaspora size increases immigration volume. Armed conflicts significantly increase
    asylum immigration by 73% and regular immigration by 110% from low-income countries.
Methodology:
  4: Panel regressions are used, but the 'kappa1ij' (cultural connection) variable
    cancels out in the regression. The model analyzes the government's reaction function
    to migration inflow (zj,t) based on GDP, expected net migration inflow, and diaspora
    size.
  5: The paper uses a model of migration based on utility maximization, Gumbel distributions,
    and McFadden's results to derive equations relating migration flows to economic
    conditions and policy responses. The analysis focuses on the marginal effects
    of changes in business cycles on migration. The model considers the impact of
    expected net migration and diasporas on policy restrictiveness, modulated by GDP.
  6: Decomposition of marginal effects to compare GDP expansion and business cycle
    changes relative to the expansion of the total amount of migrants; analysis of
    the effect of temperature anomalies on migration flows; considering Human Development
    Indicators (HDI) components separately.
  7: Fixed effects regressions (within estimator, ordinary OLS, PPML), Hodrick-Prescott
    Filter to decompose GDP per capita. Analysis is done for developed and developing
    countries.
  8: Fixed effects estimations are used to analyze the impact of various factors on
    immigration, focusing on both regular and asylum-associated migration under different
    model assumptions.
More Notes:
  6: The analysis focuses on the impact of climate change on migration flows and its
    connection to HDI and GDP.
  7: Uses Malaysia's temperature data as a proxy for Brunei Darussalam.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  4: No explicit macroeconomic outcomes are named on this page, but the text suggests
    GDP (Yj,t) is influenced by migration policy and migration flows. Potential underemployment
    and underproduction gaps are also mentioned as potential consequences.
  5: GDP effects are considered in relation to migration flows.
  6: GDP expansion
  7: GDP per capita, GNI per capita, unemployment rates, life expectancy at birth.
Quantitative material:
  4: No specific quantitative estimates of macroeconomic impacts are provided on this
    page.
  5: Equations (14) - (20.2) describe quantitative relationships between migration,
    GDP, and policy responses.
  7: Mentions regressions with heteroscedastic-robust errors. Presents equations (26),
    (27), (28), and (29).
