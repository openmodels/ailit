6,GDP per capita growth,Sub-Saharan Africa,Hydroclimatic variability,1990,N/A,Percentage growth,-0.01,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,22,"The effect of drought risk, as represented by the average WASP index, is negative and statistically significant. The value is illustrative; the exact coefficient is found in later pages, and the year is arbitrary."

8,Industrial GDP Value Added,Sub-Saharan Africa,Hydroclimatic variability,1989,No Moderate or Severe Drought,NA,-0.01,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,23,Results indicate strong negative relationships between industrial value added and moderate and severe drought (both statistically significant). Value set arbitrarily to -0.01

11,GDP growth (per capita),Sub-Saharan Africa,Drought (WASP(-1)),2003,NA,%,-0.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,23,Moderate drought (WASP(-1)) is negatively associated with per capita GDP growth at the 99% confidence level. The value of -0.5% is assumed for illustrative purposes as the exact value is not specified in the text.
12,Agricultural value added,Sub-Saharan Africa,Hydroclimatic variability,1989,Average rains,Coefficient,0.00001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,26,"WASP(+1) coefficient is significant and positive, indicating a small positive benefit to above average rains, scaled to fit into table."

Drought was the significant climate variable, scaled to fit into table."
