Drivers of Risk:
  4: New centers of economic and technological strength competing with one another,
    crisis in existing international institutions, growing migration from developing
    countries, global imbalances, environmental and climate problems, deficit of vitally
    important resources, long-term climate change, rising prices for natural resources,
    technological development
  6: Ageing population, increased demographic burden ratio, influx of migrants, environmental
    pollution.
  7: Growth in production costs of mineral extraction, stabilization of global hydrocarbon
    prices, limited opportunities to manage and redistribute oil and gas revenue,
    technological development that closes down markets.
  9: Automated transport and armaments preconceiving new de facto standards.
  10: Changes in technological and environmental standards.
  11: "End of economic growth as part of the \u2018energy pole\u2019 model; new technologies\
    \ in energy, energy saving, adaptive networks, unconventional forms of hydrocarbons;\
    \ growing capital intensity of energy resource extraction; revolution in de facto\
    \ standards linked to ICT and new materials; expanding demographic and environmental\
    \ crises and increased security risks; changes in medico-biological technologies\
    \ and ICT; growing capital intensity of energy resource extraction."
Highlights:
  4: International conflict can be caused by new economic centers and failing international
    institutions. Migration can lead to social conflict. Global imbalances create
    structural risks between debtor and creditor nations. Environmental problems,
    including resource scarcity, are intensifying. Adapting to long-term processes
    like climate change will be a key political and technological issue by the 2030s.
    Rising prices for natural resources are driven by increasingly complicated extraction
    methods. Technological development carries risks of obsolescence but also niche
    opportunities.
  6: Intense pollution and industrial waste as a macro-fiscal risk; migration impacts
    on social tension and labor shortages.
  7: Russia faces the threat of uncontrolled immigration as a result of deteriorating
    environmental conditions, faces macroeconomic risks of losing budgetary stability
    and disruption of the balance of payments due to dependence on commodity exports,
    and the cost of extracting Russian oil and gas will pose a high risk of crisis
    in the industry.
  9: 'Social challenges: conflicts and new inequalities resulting from uneven growth
    and socio-economic imbalances.'
  11: Russian economy faces two waves of strategic challenges, linked to the end of
    the 'energy pole' model and fundamental changes in medico-biological technologies
    and ICT, potentially leading to negative social effects and undermining social
    structure.
Methodology:
  4: Discussion of trends and their potential economic impact; forecasts of energy
    market price formation
  11: Analysis of challenges facing Russia's socio-economic development.
More Notes:
  4: The paper notes that while global imbalances have been halted successfully in
    the last five years, the disparity continues to have an impact on the global economy.
    The paper also claims that Russia is warming at a rate exceeding the global average
    by more than two and a half times.
  7: Mentions ICT, personalized medicine, technologies allowing bespoke production
    of mass-market products, new energy, automated vehicles, and armaments as areas
    of technological development that can bring about significant risks in certain
    sectors.
  9: The analysis focuses on the Russian S&T complex and its challenges related to
    access to technological expertise and socio-economic development.
  10: State support instruments for technological development may have reduced effectiveness.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  4: Structural risks in relationships between developed debtor countries and developing
    creditor countries, impact on the global economy from global imbalances, deteriorating
    quality of life in developing countries, rising prices for natural resources,
    potential need for transition to new energy forms, rapid obsolescence of existing
    technology, increasing complexity of new solutions and platforms
  6: Reduction in budgetary stability due to increased pension liabilities, demographic
    burden, and health care spending.
  7: Macroeconomic risks of losing budgetary stability and disruption of the balance
    of payments.
  9: Potential liquidation of Russian manufacturers in specific market niches (railway
    engineering, military air craft engineering, etc.)
  10: "Liquidation of markets due to changes in de facto standards and the introduction\
    \ of \u2018closing\u2019 technologies."
  11: "Challenges facing Russia\u2019s socio-economic development related to technological\
    \ modernization and long-term national development strategy. Potential for large-scale\
    \ negative social effects related to medico-biological technologies and ICT, including\
    \ new social inequalities and undermining social structure and sovereignty."
Quantitative material:
  4: "Average rate of warming on the Earth's surface was 0.17 \xBAC/10 years for 1976-2012;\
    \ rate of warming in Russia is 0.43 \xBAC/10 years; the average temperature for\
    \ the year in Russia was 1.52 \xBAC above 1961-1990 norms"
  6: Demographic burden expected to grow from 400 to 510 elderly citizens per 1,000
    citizens capable of work by 2030.
  7: Presents a figure (Fig. 1) depicting demographic burden dynamics in Russia from
    2010 to 2030, including number of people of working age, number of people over
    working age, and demographic burden with people over working age per 1,000 people
    of working age.
  9: Income ratio has fluctuated between 16 and 17.
  11: "Mentions two waves of strategic challenges in the near future: 2020 or slightly\
    \ later, and 2030\u20132035. Energy markets may undergo drastic transformation\
    \ within the next 5\u201310 years."
