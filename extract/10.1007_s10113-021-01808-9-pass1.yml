  3: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  9: The paper explores socio-economic and environmental changes that may lead to
    limits being reached in adaptation efforts.
  10: Changes in the ocean and cryosphere; geographical features such as rivers or
    coastlines; inadequate and mismatched human resource and technical capacities;
    lack of information, awareness, and technology; financial constraints.
  11: Hazards include precipitation variability, drought, extreme heat, ocean temperatures,
    acidification, and loss of arctic sea ice.
  12: Economic, socio-cultural, governance, institutional, and policy constraints.
Highlights:
  3: Finance, governance, institutional, and policy constraints are most prevalent
    globally.
  9: Information on limits to adaptation is scarce and tends to be more conceptual
    than analytical; Constraints related to soft limits were more prevalent than constraints
    related to hard limits. Central and South America and Small Islands face challenges
    to adaptation that may not be surmountable, leading to both soft and hard limits.
    Adaptation constraints and limits are mostly cross-sectoral, with regional differences
    in sectoral overlap.
  10: Adaptation constraints and limits may have widespread effects, especially in
    Small Islands, affecting a range of sectors; soft limits may arise and be more
    difficult to overcome in Small Islands given the high number of identified constraints;
    ecosystem-based, technological, and infrastructural responses face constraints
    that may lead to limits.
  11: Individuals and households are particularly constrained in adaptation. Finance,
    governance, institutional, and policy constraints are key challenges for government
    and civil society.
  12: Constraints to adaptation are widely acknowledged; Roughly one in four studies
    discussing limits identify hard limits where no further adaptation actions would
    be possible; Developing world contexts and Small Islands, Central and South America
    regions face more challenges and show stronger evidence of both soft and hard
    limits.
Methodology:
  3: Systematic review of 1,682 academic studies on human adaptation responses to
    identify patterns in constraints and limits to adaptation.
  9: The analysis reviews and codes 1,682 papers on adaptation action to assess constraints
    and limits, using IPCC definitions of constraints and limits.
  10: Review and synthesis of adaptation papers across different regions and sectors,
    statistical tests (Bonferroni-corrected chi-square tests of independence) to identify
    significant relationships between constraints and adaptation responses.
  11: The study performs a review and analytical synthesis of literature on constraints
    and limits to adaptation, using statistical tests (chi-square) to analyze relationships
    between hazards and constraints.
  12: Systematic review of over 1,600 peer-reviewed articles on implemented adaptation;
    in-depth review of papers offering detailed information on limits to adaptation
    using surveys, interviews, focus groups, and case study syntheses.
More Notes:
  5: This page focuses on adaptation constraints and limits, defining key terms and
    categorizing adaptation constraints. While relevant to the broader topic, it does
    not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes.
  9: The paper uses a scoring system to assess the relevance of the papers to the
    topic of limits to adaptation.
  10: Regional differences exist in sectoral concentrations of adaptation constraints/limits;
    different adaptation responses are linked to specific constraints (e.g., behavioral/cultural
    to socio-cultural, ecosystem-based to physical, institutional to governance and
    information, technological/infrastructural to information/technology/financial).
  11: There's a statistically significant correlation between constraints related
    to both soft and hard limits and impacts on individuals and households. There
    is also significant correlation between governance, institutional, and policy
    constraints and all government levels.
  12: Ecosystem-based, technological, and infrastructural adaptation responses are
    already identified as facing both soft and hard limits.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  9: The paper identifies constraints and limits to adaptation action as an outcome
    of interest.
  10: Food, fiber, and other ecosystem products, poverty, livelihoods, and sustainable
    development emerge as sectors with the largest share of papers on constraints
    and limits.
  11: The study identifies constraints and limits to adaptation that impact various
    sectors, implying potential economic costs if adaptation is hindered.
  12: Limits to adaptation, both 'soft' (constraints acknowledged) and 'hard' (no
    further adaptation actions possible).
Quantitative material:
  9: 74% of assessed papers (1,239) contained information on either constraints or
    limits to adaptation; 76% of those discussed constraints but did not directly
    relate them to limits; 23% linked constraints to limits in a general sense; 1%
    provided detailed information about soft or hard limits, including insights on
    thresholds. Australasia (58%) and Europe (62%) had lower percentages of papers
    containing information on constraints or limits compared to Small Islands (79%),
    Asia (78%), Africa (77%), and Central and South America (75%).
  10: 'Africa: 552 adaptation papers, 423 with constraints/limits; Asia: 592, 462;
    Australasia: 77, 45; Central and South America: 102, 76; Europe: 189, 119; North
    America: 225, 167; Small Islands: 80, 63; Food, fiber, and other ecosystem products
    (66%) and poverty, livelihoods, and sustainable development (48%) have the largest
    share of papers on constraints and limits; Ocean and coastal ecosystems make up
    11% of the total number of papers; Australasia (58%) and Small Islands (59%) focus
    on health, well-being, and communities; Europe cities, settlements, and key infrastructure
    (44%); 81% of papers identifying more than one constraint; Small Islands largest
    percentage of four or more constraints identified per paper (32%), while Europe
    leads in the majority of papers (43%) that acknowledge only one constraint.'
  11: 71-81% of articles described constraints that may be overcome and thus related
    to soft limits. About one-quarter reported constraints that may lead to both hard
    and soft limits. Individuals and households face either constraints or limits
    to adaptation (86% of articles). Local governments (38%) and national governments
    (33%) also face constraints. Governance, institutional, and policy constraints
    are reported in 54% of articles, while finance appears in 49% of articles.
