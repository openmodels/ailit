Drivers of Risk:
  1: Monsoon rainfall shocks (droughts and excessive rainfall)
  3: Monsoon rainfall shocks (regional or local droughts)
  5: Exogenous rainfall variations, specifically monsoon rainfall shocks, impact wages
    and prices.
  6: Local rainfall shocks impacting regions and potentially affecting food prices
    when buffer zones are extended.
  7: Monsoon rainfall shocks (regional and local), and monsoon temperature.
  8: Variations in monsoon rainfall
  10: Regional and local rainfall shocks impact food prices and wages and have varying
    effects depending on their timing during the monsoon season.
  11: Monthly standardized rainfall (overall, negative, and positive shocks)
  12: Negative rainfall shocks (drought) of below -1.5 district standard deviation
    (SD)
  13: Negative monsoon rainfall shocks.
  14: local and regional rainfall shocks, overall monsoon rainfall being below the
    district mean, average temperature during the monsoon season
  15: Negative and positive local and regional monsoon rainfall variation.
  16: Negative local rainfall shock, irrigation levels
  17: Negative rainfall shocks, specifically local and regional variations in Kharif
    rainfall below its mean.
  18: Regional rainfall shocks impacting agricultural yield and wages.
  19: Negative local/regional rainfall shocks
  21: Monsoon rainfall shocks (local and regional kharif rainfall variation)
  22: Positive regional rainfall shock in the kharif (summer) season, overall standardized
    kharif rainfall being above its mean.
  23: Monsoon rainfall shocks and the role of state-level agricultural policy impact
    wages and food prices.
  24: Negative regional rainfall shocks.
  25: Negative rainfall shocks (local and regional)
  26: Impact of negative local/regional rainfall shocks
  27: Monsoon rainfall shocks

  30: Local and regional rainfall shocks (one standard deviation decrease in overall
    standardized rainfall when overall standardized rainfall is below its mean).
  31: Negative regional rainfall shocks impact wages and prices in India.
  32: Negative regional rainfall shocks (droughts) during the Kharif season.
  33: Monsoon rainfall shocks impacting agricultural yield, wages, and food prices.
Highlights:
  1: 'Monsoon rainfall shocks have asymmetric effects on agricultural yield in India:
    droughts cause significant yield falls, while excessive rainfall has little effect.
    Short-lived yield losses after droughts lead to persistent declines in wages and
    increases in food prices lasting up to five years.'
  3: Monsoon rainfall shocks have asymmetric effects on agricultural yield in India,
    with negative shocks (droughts) having a much larger impact than positive shocks;
    Regional droughts lead to a persistent decline in wages and a persistent rise
    in food prices; The local extent of irrigation dampens the fall in agricultural
    wages after a regional drought, but not the rise in food prices.
  5: The study explores how dynamic effects of monsoon rainfall shocks impact wages
    and prices in India.
  8: Negative deviations in standardized rainfall reduce agricultural yield substantially,
    while rainfall above the district-mean reduces agricultural yield only slightly;
    a linear regression with a break point at mean district-level rainfall captures
    the non-linear effects.
  10: Regional rainfall shocks arrive during months critical for crop yield, impacting
    agricultural output and potentially affecting macroeconomic variables.
  11: Annual agricultural yield responds more sensitively to rainfall variations in
    June, September, and October than to mid-season variations.
  12: A severe negative rainfall shock leads to a sharp decline in rice yield, but
    rice yield recovers quickly in the year after the shock. Initially, nominal agricultural
    wages do not appear to be affected.
  13: Negative monsoon rainfall shocks have a lasting impact on income (agricultural
    wages) and food prices (rice prices) in India; agricultural wages are stagnant
    in the year after the shock and do not return to their pre-shock trend in the
    four years following the shock; rice prices increase in the year of the shock
    and remain above their pre-shock trend for more than two years.
  15: The study examines the responses of agricultural yield, wages, and food prices
    to different types of monsoon rainfall variation at different levels of irrigation.
    The study also examines the role of state-level agricultural policy, barriers
    to trade and migration, and the welfare implications of the findings among different
    demographic groups in rural India.
  16: Negative local rainfall shocks have adverse effects on kharif yield, but these
    effects are mitigated by irrigation. Negative local rainfall shocks lead to a
    lagged, but persistent decline in the agricultural wage.
  17: The study examines the dynamic effects of local and regional monsoon rainfall
    shocks on wages and prices in India. The effects are presented for different levels
    of irrigation.
  18: Stronger negative regional rainfall shocks result in significantly larger impacts
    on agricultural yield and wages, though these effects dissipate over a few years.
  19: Negative rainfall shocks significantly reduce agricultural yield, with the impact
    decreasing as irrigation levels increase.
  21: Effects presented for different levels of irrigation; responses to local vs.
    regional rainfall variation.
  22: A positive rainfall shock in the kharif season leads to a positive response
    in rabi crop yield and a negative response in rabi crop prices. Kharif crop yield
    declines in the year following the shock.
  23: State-year fixed effects play a significant role in the impulse response of
    wages to negative regional rainfall shocks, altering wage responses dependent
    on irrigation levels.
  24: State-year fixed effects help isolate the impact of state-level policy interventions
    (e.g., relief programs) from the impact of rainfall shocks. Relief programs may
    not be focused on the most affected districts.
  25: Internal migration across the whole NSS region is able to completely dampen
    the decline in local agricultural wages in response to a purely local negative
    rainfall shock. Internal migration less effectively mitigates the adverse effects
    of a negative rainfall shock affecting the whole NSS region.
  26: Effects are presented for different levels of irrigation; effects are shown
    based on administrative divisions; figure depicts the impact of negative local/regional
    rainfall shocks
  27: Impact of positive local/regional rainfall shocks on wages and prices, conditional
    on different levels of irrigation. Results based on administrative divisions.
  28: Intra-regional food trade within the district and the 200 km buffer zone is
    able to completely dampen the rise in local food prices in response to purely
    local negative rainfall shocks.
  29: Purchasing power of agricultural laborers falls by about 3% due to rising food
    prices; this level persists on average over the next five years.
  30: Rainfall shocks negatively impact the welfare of agricultural laborers and cultivators,
    with cultivators generally experiencing larger percentage losses, especially in
    the short run (year 0).  The impact varies depending on the level of irrigation
    and whether the shock is local or regional.
  31: Agricultural labourers and cultivators reduce their consumption on staple foods
    post-rainfall shock.
  32: Droughts severely impact both cultivators and agricultural labourers, but cultivators
    seem better able to smooth staple food consumption, possibly by adjusting luxury
    good expenditures or using savings. Agricultural labourers experience a persistent
    decline in staple food consumption for several years after a drought, indicating
    credit constraints.
  33: Effects of monsoon rainfall shocks are asymmetric, with negative shocks causing
    significant yield loss, persistent wage decline, and immediate food price rise.
Methodology:
  1: The paper uses econometric methods (likely panel data, given the reference to
    C33) to analyze the effects of rainfall shocks. The results are applicable to
    India.
  3: Empirical analysis of the effects of monsoon rainfall shocks on wages and prices
    in India
  5: Exogenous rainfall variations are identified using standardized measurements
    of summer monsoon rainfall at the district level based on gridded monthly rainfall
    data.
  6: Analysis involves using standardized rainfall data for districts and buffer zones,
    with buffer area variations tested for sensitivity.
  7: The study uses standardized rainfall data and decomposes it into regional and
    local components to analyze the effects of rainfall shocks. The distribution of
    standardized monsoon rainfall at the district level closely matches a normal distribution.
  8: Binned scatterplot and LOWESS regression are used to illustrate the effects of
    variations in monsoon rainfall on agricultural yield.
  10: The analysis includes the decomposition of rainfall shocks along spatial dimensions
    and their impact on agricultural yield using scatter plots and regression techniques.
  11: Univariate regressions of annual agricultural yield on monthly standardized
    rainfall, with separate regressions for negative and positive rainfall shocks;
    district-level clustered standard errors.
  12: "Quasi-event study using averaged raw data for agricultural yield, wages, and\
    \ food prices across districts before, during, and after a severe negative rainfall\
    \ shock; requires no other negative/positive shock of more than one standard deviation\
    \ in a window of \xB1 three years around the negative shock."
  13: Panel VAR model using data from 310 Indian districts, controlling for unobserved
    heterogeneity at the district level using the Helmert transformation and demeaning
    all variables by state-year fixed effects.
  14: Panel VAR model with a third-order lag (I=3), Andrews and Lu (2001) lag-length
    selection criterion
  15: Panel VAR (Vector Autoregression) model is used to analyze the dynamic effects
    of monsoon rainfall shocks, controlling for district and state-year fixed effects.
    The analysis is performed at the district level in India. The study analyzes impulse
    response functions.
  16: "Analysis uses district-level data in India, excluding outlier districts based\
    \ on rainfall standard deviation. The analysis clusters standard errors at the\
    \ district level. Sample is split into subsamples covering the years 1967\u2013\
    1991 and 1981\u20132005 to examine the time stability of the results and investigate\
    \ whether the shocks had different effects in the southern and eastern parts of\
    \ India compared with the northern and western parts."
  17: Impulse response analysis using 2,952 observations, standard errors clustered
    at the district level over a five-year horizon. Analysis considers different levels
    of irrigation.
  18: Analysis examines agricultural yield and wages responses to rainfall shocks,
    considering regional rainfall's impact compared to local shocks.
  19: District-level clustered standard errors are reported in parentheses. Significance
    levels are indicated by asterisks.
  21: Impulse response functions based on standard errors clustered at the district
    level
  22: Impulse response functions (VAR model) are used to analyze the impact of a positive
    regional rainfall shock on kharif and rabi crop yields and prices and agricultural
    wages. The results are applicable when overall standardized kharif rainfall is
    above its mean at the 25th percentile of irrigation.
  23: The analysis uses state-year fixed effects and a VAR (Vector Autoregression)
    model to assess the impact of monsoon shocks and state-level policies.
  24: Uses a Panel Vector Autoregression (PVAR) with national-year fixed effects to
    analyze the impact of rainfall shocks. The model is applicable to the specific
    context of the data used (location not specified on this page).
  25: The analysis uses NSS (National Sample Survey Organisation) regions, defined
    as aggregates of districts within the same state with similar geographical features,
    rural population densities, and crop patterns, to analyze the impact of local
    and regional rainfall shocks on wages and prices. A distance-based measure is
    also used as a baseline specification. The results remain robust when excluding
    districts belonging to the set of 15 out of 36 Indian states and union territories
    that consist of just one NSS region.
  26: Regional shock based on NSS regions (as defined in the 44th round, 1988) instead
    of a 200 km distance-based measure; standard errors clustered at the district
    level
  27: Analysis of impact of positive local/regional rainfall shocks based on administrative
    divisions, clustered at the district level over a horizon of five years. Regional
    shock based on NSS regions (44th round, 1988) instead of a 200 km distance-based
    measure.
  29: Partial equilibrium analysis assuming fixed shares of income on food, constant
    other expenditures, no unemployment, and fixed own labor input for cultivators.
  30: Partial equilibrium effects of rainfall shocks on purchasing power are analyzed.
    The applicability is specific to the context studied (likely India, given the
    reference to rural India and the International Labour Organization, 1996).
  31: Combines individual-level consumption data from the National Sample Survey with
    regional rainfall shocks, analyzing consumption patterns post-shock.
  32: Regression analysis with NSS region and year fixed effects, examining the impact
    of rainfall shocks on consumption patterns aggregated at the NSS region level.

    and cultivators. Results presented with 90 percent confidence intervals based
    on robust standard errors.
  33: Dynamic approach capturing lasting effects, distinguishing between positive
    and negative rainfall shocks and considering their spatial dimension.
More Notes:
  1: Internal migration is linked to National Sample Survey region (state), while
    food arbitrage trading is more related to distance.
  3: Regional droughts have important distributional consequences, negatively impacting
    agricultural laborers in real terms due to persistent wage decline and food price
    increases; Cultivators can gain from the medium-term rise in prices, while subsistence
    farmers are more severely affected; Internal migration is determined by affiliation
    to the same NSS region, while distance is more relevant for food arbitrage trading.
  11: The relative contribution of regional rainfall to overall standardized rainfall
    variability is higher in June, September, and October than in July and August.
  15: The study accounts for the formation of new Indian states between 1967 and 2005.
  16: The study accounts for state-year fixed effects to capture general wage and/or
    price movements, as well as other state-level developments. The delayed wage response
    likely relates to nominal wage rigidities in the Indian agricultural sector.
  17: The study focuses on Kharif rainfall, which is a specific monsoon season in
    India.
  22: The limited availability of data for rabi crop yields and prices means the results
    should be seen as an illustration of a potential channel at work. Confidence intervals
    are adjusted to the 66 percent level due to missing data for rabi crop yield and
    prices.
  23: The page discusses the influence of state-level policies and infrastructure
    issues on agricultural outcomes, such as availability and pricing of food.
  24: The analysis suggests that state-year fixed effects absorb a systematically
    positive contribution to the impulse response of agricultural yield and a systematically
    negative contribution to the impulse response of food prices after a rainfall
    shock. This is likely due to the expansionary impact of relief programs.
  25: State borders are relatively more important for migration, while distance is
    relatively more important for trade in food products. NSS borders often represent
    borders in terms of agro-climatic conditions.
  26: No relevant information
  28: Distance, rather than affiliation to the same NSS region (and thus to the same
    state), seems to be the key determinant of trade in food products in India.
  30: The study notes that while agricultural laborers may experience smaller percentage
    losses in purchasing power, the impact may be more severe due to their lower income
    levels. The analysis assumes a 73% income share spent on food.
  32: The study suggests that cultivators have more capacity to buffer the impact
    of drought on staple food consumption compared to agricultural labourers. The
    analysis focuses on the short-term (1-2 year) impacts following a drought event.

    consumption patterns. Sample sizes: all rural = 247,346; agricultural labourers
    = 62,236; cultivators = 102,575. Time period: 1989-2006.'
