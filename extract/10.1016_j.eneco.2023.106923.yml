Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (more frequent and intense extreme temperature events), growing
    per-capita income driving AC adoption, unexpected daily weather anomalies, decade-long
    climatic changes.
  2: Changes in temperature (transient extreme heat exposures, low-frequency interannual
    evolution of decadal average daily maximum temperatures), weather anomalies, and
    climate conditions.
  4: Daily maximum temperature, weather anomalies (deviation from 30-year moving average
    of daily maximum temperature), long-run climate normals (30-year moving average
    of daily maximum temperature)
  5: Shifts in daily maximum temperatures due to climate change and their interaction
    with per capita income levels.
  6: Shifts in daily maximum temperature distributions (climate change), weather anomalies
    (short-term temperature shocks), per capita income changes, and adoption rates
    of air-cooling appliances drive the peak load changes.
  7: Shifts in mean climate, weather anomalies (positive temperature anomalies), socio-economic
    growth (per capita income, population), and geographical heterogeneity.
  8: Climate change-induced shifts in daily maximum temperatures and the impact of
    weather anomalies.
  9: Climate change (temperature increases), weather anomalies, per capita income
    growth.
  10: Long-run climatic changes and unexpected weather anomalies affecting peak electricity
    load.
Highlights:
  1: Short- and long-run dynamics of temperature impacts on peak load differ substantially;
    per capita income modulates adjustments in both the short and long run; climate
    change may significantly increase peak load by 2050, especially in Southern Europe
    and India; interannual variability of maximum temperatures can amplify climate
    change impacts.
  2: The intensive-margin adjustment does not account for the consequences of more
    gradual extensive-margin adaptation.
  5: Significant increase in electricity demand for cooling at temperatures above
    certain thresholds, both in Europe and India, suggesting adaptation challenges.
  6: Increasing air-cooling appliance adoption is identified as a key adaptation strategy.
    The long-run peak load response is significantly larger than the short-run response,
    highlighting the importance of considering adaptation in projections. Per capita
    income modulates both short-run and long-run peak load responses.
  7: Climate change impacts peak demand heterogeneously across regions. A North-South
    gradient exists in Europe, with northern countries seeing reduced winter peak
    loads and southern countries experiencing exacerbated summer peaks.
  8: A significant peak load increase of 140% in India and 19% in Europe by 2050,
    driven by economic and population growth independent of climate change.
  9: Climate change adaptation will be driven by movements along the extensive margin.
    Changes in electricity demand are driven by movements along the extensive margin.
  10: The methodology identifies the impact of long-run climatic changes on peak load
    in Europe and India.
Methodology:
  1: Decomposes short- from medium/long-run effects of temperature on daily electricity
    peak load using mixed frequency panel data across states in Europe and India;
    treats economic growth as a modulating factor; decomposes transitory (intensive
    margin) adjustments from permanent (extensive margin) adjustments.
  2: Proposes a methodology to disentangle the intensive- and extensive-margin adaptation
    components that are latent in the relationship between electricity demand and
    temperature. Decomposes electricity demand into long-run extensive margin and
    short-run intensive margin components.
  4: Fixed-effect panel model estimated separately for Europe and India, using temperature
    bins and interaction terms to capture non-linearities and asymmetric effects.
  5: Analysis uses GCM-simulated data for projected climate scenarios and income variations,
    estimating impacts on peak electricity load through econometric models with fixed
    effects.
  6: The analysis uses a spline function modulated by a short-run adjustment effect
    triggered by weather anomalies to model peak load response to temperature. It
    considers both short-run (weather anomalies) and long-run (climate shifts) responses,
    incorporating income effects and appliance adoption.
  7: Analysis of peak load responses to maximum temperature exposure, distinguishing
    between short-run and long-run adaptation responses. Standard deviation of future
    maximum temperatures anomalies are computed using 25 GCMs for the period 2040-2060.
  8: Results are based on projections for circa 2050 using 25 General Circulation
    Models (GCMs) under RCP 5-8.5, comparing peak load due to climatic shifts and
    weather anomalies.
  9: Panel data analysis decomposing climate and weather anomalies to obtain long-run
    responses. Extensive margin adjustments (e.g., AC ownership) are considered in
    addition to intensive margin adjustments. The model specification incorporates
    the amplification effect of per capita income on peak load sensitivity.
  10: The paper proposes a methodology to assess climate change adaptation through
    decomposing load-weather co-variation, keeping the high-frequency nature to capture
    fast responses of peak load to weather anomalies.
More Notes:
  1: The paper highlights the importance of considering the structure of the economy
    and future income growth in shaping adaptation to climate change and the need
    to accommodate peak load in days with extreme temperatures, and provides policy
    implications for power systems.
  2: The paper aims to address the challenge of disentangling the mingled effects
    of weather and climate on electricity demand by distinguishing between the responses
    of peak load to high-frequency transitory departures of daily maximum temperatures
    from their climatic normal values and those to the low-frequency, interannual
    evolution of decadal average daily maximum temperatures and per-capita income.
  4: The analysis explores how income affects the response of electricity demand to
    climate and weather anomalies through interaction terms.
  5: Adapting to hotter climates impacts sensitivity of energy demand to temperature;
    extensive use of econometric modeling to estimate climate-related peaks in electricity
    demand.
  6: The analysis differentiates between intensive (short-run) and extensive (long-run)
    margin responses to temperature changes, emphasizing the role of the extensive
    margin in long-run peak load adjustments.
  7: The gradient effect is not monotonically increasing all the way to the equator
    due to different climate distributions.
  9: The findings likely identify combined shifts from the short- to the long-run
    sensitivity of peak load of different responses across sectors. The extensive
    margin shock is going to be very relevant in places that already have high levels
    of income through the temperature channel, as well as in hot places that are poor
    though the income growth channel.
