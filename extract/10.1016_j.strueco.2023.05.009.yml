Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature changes (rise)
  2: Temperature changes/shocks, climate variability
  3: "Rising temperatures relative to historical norms (\u0394T > 0)"
  5: "Consistent changes in temperature, high temperatures (above 32\xB0C), daily\
    \ temperature variability, and deviation from historical temperature norms significantly\
    \ impact macroeconomic outcomes."
  7: Temperature change affecting productivity level, temporary impact on growth rate,
    long-run productivity growth rate, trade between countries/regions
  8: Temperature shocks, weather and climate variations.
Highlights:
  1: Estimates of damage through growth effects are generally much larger than those
    through level effects. Diverse impact mechanisms and adaptation effects can be
    revealed by changing the time resolution of temperature variables, introducing
    non-linearity into econometrics functions, and specifying temperature deviation.
    Combining the cross-sectional and panel model would enable us to examine the economic
    impacts at different future times.
  2: The paper reviews the climate econometrics literature on the temperature-GDP
    nexus, identifies differences between growth and level effects of temperature,
    summarizes characteristics of impact functions, categorizes forms of temperature
    variables, reviews the development of climate econometric models, identifies channels
    for combining climate econometrics with IAMs, and illuminates limitations of existing
    studies, suggesting future directions.
  3: Rising temperatures can damage GDP level, but GDP can restart growth at the rate
    prior to the temperature rise (level effect); or temperature rise permanently
    affects economic output growth (growth effect), and this effect will not disappear
    even if the temperature returns to the pre-warming value.
  5: Key findings include the impact of consistent temperature changes and daily temperature
    variability on GDP growth and industrial output, and the importance of identifying
    critical temperature thresholds for adaptation planning.
  7: Climate change might affect the pace of GDP growth, not only its level.
  8: Climate econometrics can provide empirical evidence for improving damage functions
    in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs).
Methodology:
  1: Climate econometrics to parameterise the impacts of climate on economic outcomes
    using historical data; review of growth and level effects, temperature variable
    forms and functional forms, and model specification; Combining empirical findings
    with climate change integrated assessment models (IAMs) to improve damage modelling.
  2: Climate econometrics models, various model specifications, panel models, and
    use of temperature data at annual, monthly, and seasonal resolutions.
  3: Discusses growth vs level effects, linear vs non-linear functional forms for
    temperature-GDP relationships, and the use of lagged terms of temperature to investigate
    temperature effects on GDP.
  5: The paper uses temperature bins and panel models to perform non-parametric analysis,
    identifying relationships between temperature changes and GDP. It highlights the
    need for high-resolution data to avoid inaccurate estimations due to smoothing
    of extreme temperature days.
  7: Reduced-form temperature-GDP relationship, level and growth effects models
  8: Climate econometrics models, linear and non-linear panel models, cross-sectional
    models, hybrid panel models. The results from non-linear panel models can reflect
    both short- and long-term impacts. Future studies should use more comprehensive
    data and integrate long-difference non-linear models to identify climate adaptation
    patterns at a regional level over an extended period of time.
More Notes:
  1: The paper reviews literature on climate econometrics analysis of the relationship
    between temperature and GDP.
  2: The paper highlights the lack of consensus regarding growth and level effects,
    encourages use of variables that capture climate variability, and suggests that
    projecting future climate impacts by extrapolating existing relationships may
    result in estimation bias due to not fully reflecting future adaptation effects.
  3: The paper notes a lack of consensus on identifying and interpreting growth and
    level effects in empirical studies.
  7: Future research should incorporate multiple model specifications of climate econometrics
    into a single model to distinguish between level and growth effects in the short,
    medium, and long term.
  8: Future research should investigate the effects and costs of climate adaptation
    in the macroeconomic system from a top-down perspective based on innovative econometric
    models and increasingly abundant data. Future research should also measure the
    relationship between the impacts of temperature on macroeconomic factors such
    as physical capital stock and productivity.

Quantitative material:
  7: Compared with the original DICE-2016 damage function predictions, the authors
    determined that the social cost of carbon is higher than three times higher when
    incorporating the damage function calibrated by their empirical results into the
    DICE-2016.
