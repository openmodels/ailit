Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature rise.
  2: Temperature
  3: "Rising temperatures (\u0394T > 0) relative to historical norms are the primary\
    \ driver of risk discussed."
  4: Annual average temperature, monthly temperatures (including extremes and variability),
    and seasonal temperatures (summer, autumn, spring).
  5: The page highlights consistent changes in temperature, daily temperature variability,
    and deviations from historical temperature norms as drivers impacting economic
    outcomes.
  6: Temperature variations (weather shocks and climate change), sunlight duration.
  7: The primary driver of risk is temperature change, modeled both as level effects
    (affecting economic output directly) and growth effects (affecting the rate of
    GDP growth).
  8: Focuses on temperature deviations from historical norms and their impact on GDP.
  10: References temperature as a factor impacting outcomes related to productivity.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Evaluates the economic impacts caused by climate change, specifically the relationship
    between temperature and gross domestic product (GDP).
  2: Macro-economic output (GDP) is used to measure the economic impact of climate
    change.
  3: The paper discusses the impact of temperature on GDP, considering both 'level'
    and 'growth' effects.
  4: This paper evaluates the impact of temperature (annual, monthly, and seasonal)
    on economic outcomes, specifically GDP, GSP, and productivity.
  5: This page discusses the potential impacts of temperature variability and deviations
    from historical norms on macro-economic outputs, such as GDP and economic growth.
  6: Economic growth, crop yields, energy demand, labor productivity, and human capital.
  7: This paper focuses on evaluating the economic impacts of climate change, specifically
    on GDP.
  8: The paper discusses the long-term economic impacts of climate change, emphasizing
    the bias that can occur if econometrics models do not account for both short-
    and long-term adaptations.
  10: The page mentions temperature effects on productivity in Chinese manufacturing
    plants, which may relate to productivity loss.
Highlights:
  1: Estimates of damage through growth effects are generally much larger than those
    through level effects. Diverse impact mechanisms and adaptation effects can be
    revealed by changing the time resolution of temperature variables, introducing
    non-linearity into econometrics functions, and specifying temperature deviation.
    Combining cross-sectional and panel models enables examination of economic impacts
    at different future times.
  2: Identifies critical differences between growth and level effects of temperature
    on GDP, characteristics of impact functions, forms of temperature variables, and
    climate econometric model specifications.
  3: 'The paper highlights the ongoing debate about whether temperature changes have
    a temporary (level) or permanent (growth) impact on GDP. The ''growth'' effect
    models result in projected long-term economic damages of global warming that are
    orders of magnitude higher than conventional estimates (level effect). The paper
    divides the climate effects on economic growth into three channels according to
    time scales: short-run production impacts, temporary growth rate effects, and
    long-run productivity growth.'
  4: The paper highlights the importance of considering non-linear relationships and
    adaptations when modeling the impact of temperature on GDP. It also emphasizes
    the significance of examining monthly and seasonal temperature variations to capture
    the complexities of climate change impacts.
  5: The analysis indicates that non-linearities in temperature effects are significant,
    requiring high-resolution data to accurately estimate impacts on economic growth.
  6: Panel models offer advantages for causal identification compared to cross-sectional
    regressions. Hybrid models describe changes closer to climate change rather than
    weather change, better capturing long-term climate impacts. Research aims to reveal
    whether temperature's effects on GDP are persistent.
  7: The paper highlights that climate change might affect the pace of GDP growth,
    not only its level. It also emphasizes the importance of modeling adaptation effects
    and exploring empirical links between climate change and non-market sectors.
  8: Non-linear models can better reflect both short- and long-term economic impacts
    of climate events, reducing bias in damage estimates.
Methodology:
  1: Reviews literature on growth and level effects, temperature variable forms, functional
    forms, and model specification in climate econometrics. Introduces an approach
    for combining empirical findings with climate change integrated assessment models
    (IAMs).
  2: Reviews climate econometrics literature on the temperature-GDP nexus.
  4: The paper discusses linear, non-linear (quadratic), and hybrid models used in
    climate econometrics to assess the impact of temperature on economic outcomes.  It
    also mentions the use of panel models based on sub-national datasets.
  5: Temperature bins and cross-sectional and panel models are mentioned as methodologies
    for examining the non-linear effects of temperature on GDP, and to capture long-term
    effects considering adaptation and non-linearity.
  6: Panel models with fixed effects and time trends; long difference approach; hybrid
    panel models. Addresses medium- and long-run climate impacts and adaptation effects.
    HPJ-FE estimator to address endogeneity issues. Distinguishes between short-,
    medium- and long-term effects of temperature.
  7: The paper discusses using integrated assessment models (IAMs) to model climate
    impacts, particularly focusing on growth shocks and how they affect damage assessment.
    It advocates for differentiating between short- and long-run effects to better
    identify adaptation effects. It suggests refining the use of long difference models
    and focusing on deviations from long-run averages in panel data analyses.
  8: Advocates for the use of non-linear panel models to account for both short-run
    and long-run impacts, instead of linear models which may fail to capture necessary
    long-term adaptation effects.
  10: Indicates some analysis is based on evidence from manufacturing plants, but
    specific methods are not detailed on this page.
More Notes:
  2: The paper aims to improve the accuracy of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs)
    by examining the costs and benefits trade-offs of mitigation by estimating the
    relationship between temperature and GDP using the climate econometrics model.
  3: The paper mentions that the choice of linear vs. non-linear models can significantly
    impact damage estimations. The figure shows a conceptual representation of GDP
    pathways under different temperature effects.
  4: The paper argues that linear models may only capture short-term effects and temporary
    temperature shocks, potentially leading to biased estimations of long-term GDP
    impacts. Non-linear models can better account for adaptations and marginal effects
    of temperature changes.
  6: Discusses the importance of distinguishing between short-run and long-run effects
    due to adaptation. Acknowledges potential biases in fixed effects panel regression
    due to short-run weather variation emphasis. Mentions bi-directional feedback
    effects between temperature and economic growth. Discusses improvements of damage
    functions in IAMs by incorporating empirical research on long-term economic effects
    and accounting for dynamic effects.
  7: The paper acknowledges limitations in modeling adaptation effects due to a lack
    of data on aggregated costs and benefits of adaptation measures. It suggests that
    future research should incorporate multiple model specifications of climate econometrics
    into a single model to distinguish between the two effects in the short, medium,
    and long term.
  8: The paper reviews the evolution of econometric models, highlighting recent improvements
    that better integrate adaptative capacities and distinguish short-, medium-, and
    long-term climate impacts.
