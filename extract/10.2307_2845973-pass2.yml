  3: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change is likely to alter forest productivity.
  3: Climate change is a key driver of risk, impacting forest and rangeland resources.
  10: "Changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels (doubling to 625 ppm), temperature\
    \ increases (2.8-4.2\xB0C), precipitation changes (7.8% to 11%)."
  12: Changes in Net Primary Productivity (NPP) driven by climate change (temperature,
    water availability, CO2 concentration, nitrogen)
  13: Changes imposed on the ATLAS growth and yield functions in the 1993 and 2005
    RPA Timber Assessments analyses, implicitly reflecting climate change or other
    factors influencing forest growth.
  16: The risk driver is implicit in the changes in NPP and vegetation biomass within
    the defined forest regions. These changes are influenced by the factors affecting
    forest health and timber resources, although specific drivers causing these changes
    are not mentioned on this page.
  17: Changes in regional productivity capacity due to climate change.
  20: Projected climate change and carbon dioxide change.
  23: Large-scale forest dieback associated with stress, beetle outbreaks, large fires,
    and climate change, leading to changes in species composition and forested landscape.
  25: Climate change
  27: Climate change impacts on Net Primary Productivity (NPP) of forests, trade dynamics,
    and economic adjustments within the forest sector.
  28: Climate change scenarios (low, midrange, and high emission scenarios leading
    to different temperature increases), ecological impacts of climate change, timber
    supply in undeveloped regions, vegetation carbon dynamics.
  29: Climate change, specifically its impact on forest products (softwood and hardwood)
    markets.
  30: Climate change (dieback and regeneration scenarios).
  31: The dynamics of global and regional climate influenced by greenhouse gases such
    as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides, and chlorofluorocarbons.
  32: Greenhouse gas concentrations influenced by economic activity, population growth,
    and demand for energy resources are a key driver.
  34: Changes in carbon dioxide levels, climate change impacting forest succession
    (disturbances like fires and droughts), large-scale dieback events, migration
    of new species across the landscape, land-use change related to urbanization.
Highlights:
  2: The forest sector is remarkably adaptable in the face of these potential climate
    changes. Climate change is likely to alter forest productivity with potential
    increases in the near future.
  3: RPA Resource Assessments have included an analysis of the vulnerability of US
    ecosystems to climate change, and the potential impact on social and economic
    systems.
  10: Climate change is projected to increase forest productivity (NPP) in the USA,
    but timber management practices could potentially lead to larger increases in
    productivity.
  13: Timber growth rate is analyzed and compared between the 1993 and 2005 RPA assessments,
    revealing how growth rate projections changed between the two analyses. The direction
    of changes appears to vary by forest type and region.
  16: The most important outcome is the assessment of timber resources using changes
    in NPP and vegetation biomass. This highlights the changes occurring in different
    forest regions (South, Central, Southeast).
  17: Southern regions showed the smallest increase in productivity capacity to climate
    change; high elevation forests or those in the North experienced significant gains.
    The harvest increase in the South is proportionally greater than that in the combined
    regions of the Northwest and Southwest Pacific, despite productivity increases
    being greater in other regions.
  20: Climate and carbon dioxide change leads to greater increases in forest growth
    and inventories than climate change alone. Impacts on timber harvest and product
    markets are relatively small and extend over the projection period. Regional stumpage
    prices are more sensitive than national product markets due to interregional and
    international substitution.
  25: Climate change can lead to both increases (regeneration) and decreases (dieback)
    in the net present value of new market surplus in timber markets, depending on
    the specific climate and biogeochemical models used.
  27: Climate change generally hurts timber-producing regions and benefits consumers
    due to expanding NPP of the world's forests. The overall net economic impact on
    the forest sector is positive, with a range of $10.7 to $15.9 billion NPV. Trade
    tends to dampen the effects of climate change on forest product markets.
  28: Higher growth leads to larger timber growing stock that lowers log prices, increases
    consumption, and improves total economic welfare under all scenarios. Regional
    results vary considerably among themselves and with the global results.
  29: Globally, economic welfare increases under all climate change scenarios, despite
    regional variations in gains and losses. Trade in forest products plays an important
    role in whether a region realizes any gains associated with climate change.
  30: Timber prices are predicted to be lower under climate change. Net market surplus
    is expected to increase globally. North America and the former Soviet Union may
    experience welfare losses.
  31: The interaction between climate changes and land-surface processes like vegetation
    change and productivity shifts are studied using detailed atmospheric and land-surface
    models.
Methodology:
  2: Analytical tools used to quantify impacts of climate change on forest productivity,
    forest diversity, and the supply and demand for wood products.
  3: The Forest Service conducts national assessments and updates to review forest
    and range resources, including wildlife, water, timber, recreation, range forage,
    and minerals, following the 1974 RPA legislation amended by the 1990 Food, Agriculture,
    Conservation, and Trade Act to include climate change impacts.
  10: Climate models (GCMs) were run for current and doubled CO2 climate scenarios.
    The TEM model was used to project ecosystem productivity based on the climate
    model outputs. Results are applicable to approximately 2065 under the IPCC business-as-usual
    scenario.
  12: The change in NPP from the baseline climate is calculated and used to modify
    timber yield functions in the Assessment System (TEM-Timber Assessment Projection
    System) via ATLAS model over time assuming a linear change in NPP from 1990-2065.
  13: Compares changes to the growth and yield functions in the ATLAS model used in
    the 1993 and 2005 RPA Timber Assessments.  The table presents the distribution
    of percent changes in growth rates.
  16: The analysis involves developing changes in NPP over a projection period (1991-2065)
    and using changes in vegetation biomass for the 2005 Timber Assessment. The same
    time periods are used to summarize the changes. There are also uses of 'delta'
    values, along with upper and lower confidence intervals. Specific regions and
    forest types are compared.
  17: The Assessment System model adjusts demand in various regions to take advantage
    of lower-cost raw materials. The model also considers substitution between softwood
    and hardwood fiber types, as well as between FI and NIPF ownerships.
  20: TEM-Timber Assessment Projection System analyses.
  23: Forest sector market models with intertemporal optimization are used to analyze
    the dynamic adjustment of the stumpage market to large-scale catastrophic events.
    Steady-state ecological responses are converted to dynamic responses by assuming
    a linear pathway for climate change.
  25: Biogeographical models (DOLY, BIOME2, MAPSS) are combined with climate models
    (UKMO, OSU) and biogeochemistry models (TEM, CENTURY, BIOME-BGC) to estimate the
    change in net present value of timber market surplus. Net present value is measured
    with a discount rate of 5%.
  27: The analysis uses four Global Climate Models (GCMs) and two economic scenarios
    to project the impact of climate change on global timber markets and regional
    forest sector activity. The analysis uses a 4% real discount rate when computing
    net present value. The results are applicable to the forest sector.
  28: The CGTM (computable general timber model) was used to analyze the impacts of
    climate change on the global forest sector, with three transient climate change
    scenarios (1990-2100) from the IGSM sensitivity study. The TEM model simulated
    vegetation carbon dynamics annually throughout the period, and this response was
    imposed across all age classes in CGTM.
  29: The analysis uses scenarios (high, moderate, and low emission climate scenarios)
    and examines intensive and extensive margins of change. Welfare is defined as
    the sum of economic welfare to the timber producer, log processor, and product
    consumer for major forest sector markets (USA, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, Western
    continental Europe, Finland, Sweden, and Japan). Changes are measured from the
    economic baseline (no climate change).
  30: A forest sector model using intertemporal optimization that incorporates 46
    different ecosystem and management types. Steady-state results from an ecological
    model BIOME3 are converted into transient scenarios based on proportional changes
    in climatic variables.
  31: General or global circulation models are used to study the dynamics of the atmosphere,
    natural variability in climate, and interactions with the Earth's land surface
    and ocean.
  32: Uses a spectrum of projections with multiple climate models to address uncertainty
    and employs downscaling methods to apply large-scale models to regional levels.
  34: Forest sector models are used, including FASOM analyses, to assess the impacts
    of climate change on forestry and land use. Ecological models identify large-scale
    disturbances, and a pathway of response is developed exogenously to both ecological
    and economic models to identify species response to climate change.
More Notes:
  2: Considers impacts of extensive forest mortality (dieback) and adaptive responses
    by producers (salvage harvest, planting appropriate species).
  10: The range of projected NPP increases due to climate change (8-27%) was within
    the range of other analyses at the time.
  12: Three climate scenarios (minimum, mean, and maximum changes in NPP) are based
    on the delta (change in NPP) calculation between current CO2 and 2xCO2 projections.
    The TEM types were then matched to the FIA forest types in ATLAS within the timber
    supply regions.
  16: The page describes the changes that occurred between 1993 and 2005 in the Timber
    Assessment, linking NPP and vegetation biomass changes. The relationships between
    regions and the timber assessments are noted. It mentions the use of data developed
    during the 1993 and 2005 Timber Assessments.
  17: The analysis suggests that increased timber inventories do not necessarily translate
    to increased harvests, and that including market details alters the impact of
    climate change.
  20: The analysis distinguishes between a "climate-only" scenario and a "climate
    and carbon dioxide" scenario. The increase in inventories is greatest in the South.
    Baseline run sees hardwood inventories decline without climate change.
  23: The analysis considers the supply of timber for short periods and potential
    management options for replanting. It does not consider salvage or changes in
    genetic stock or tree species. The migration of species to a more favorable climate
    is also not incorporated.
  25: 'The table presents results for two specific pathways: Dieback and Regeneration.
    The study focuses on the timber market.'
  27: The impact was likely overstated when not accounting for trade and other economic
    adjustments. The development of the former Soviet Union is a critical uncertainty
    to softwood dynamics.
  28: Uncertainty in economic models appears to be at least as great as the uncertainty
    in GCMs. Understanding economic and institutional response to climatic change
    is as important as understanding biophysical responses.
  29: The analysis considers the impact of climate change on timber owners, mill processors,
    and product consumers differently. Regions with the lowest wood fiber production
    costs are able to expand harvests.
  34: The page highlights the limitations in modeling complex ecological processes
    like species migration and forest succession, which restrict the application of
    these models for management recommendations.
No relevant information:
  4: This page focuses on forestry and climate change modeling frameworks, but does
    not provide specific quantitative macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes related
    to climate change impacts or adaptation costs/benefits at a national level.
  8: No relevant information
  33: This page focuses on ecological modeling of climate change impacts on forests,
    specifically on forest growth and timber inventory. It does not directly address
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, costs/benefits of adaptation at a national
    level, or other economic factors beyond the forest sector. The analysis seems
    to be limited to modeling ecological responses and does not make the step towards
    economic modeling or economic outcomes.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Producer welfare declines, but consumers generally gain.
  10: Forest productivity (NPP) change due to climate change and timber management
    practices.
  12: Timber yield
  13: Percent change in growth rate of timber.
  16: 'This page doesn''t directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes
    of climate change adaptation. Instead, it focuses on timber assessment analyses
    using data from 1993 and 2005 RPA Timber Assessments. The outcomes are related
    to changes in NPP and vegetation biomass in different forest regions. Specifically
    mentioned are regions: South, Central, Southeast.'
  17: Timber supply shifts between regions in the USA due to changes in productive

    regional welfare changes.
  31: Consumers and producers gain from climate change in developing countries through
    lower prices and minimal dieback with higher forest productivity.
Quantitative material:
  2: Increases in the timber inventory lead eventually to lower prices as increases
    in timber harvests enter the market.
  10: NPP of temperate forests in the USA increased from 8% to 27% under a doubled
    CO2 climate scenario, depending on the climate scenario. Timber management could
    potentially enhance forest productivity by 25-39%.
  13: Provides minimum, mean delta, maximum delta, lower confidence interval, and
    upper confidence interval for the percent change in growth rate for various forest
    types and regions, comparing the 1993 and 2005 RPA Timber Assessments.
  16: Yes, there is quantitative information. The page includes references to specific
    delta values, confidence intervals, and years (1991-2065 for NPP projection, 1993
    and 2005 for Timber Assessments). There are also mentions of specific numbers
    like 4, 11, 19, 5, 6, 14, 31, 12, 13, 2, 20, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, -7, 43, 18,
    19, 20, 9, -0.5, 16, 32, 17, 18, 19.
  20: Softwood inventories increase by 9.3% (climate and carbon dioxide scenario)
    vs 2.3% (climate-only scenario); Hardwood inventories increase by 5.6% (climate
    and carbon dioxide scenario) vs 1.2% (climate-only scenario). Total US softwood
    sawtimber harvest in 2050 increases by 0.9% (climate and carbon dioxide scenario)
    and 0.3% (climate-only scenario). Softwood sawtimber prices falling by 18% in
    the Pacific Northwest West and 11% in the South under the climate and carbon dioxide
    scenario. Softwood sawtimber prices falling by 6% in the Pacific Northwest West
    and 1% in the South in the climate-only scenario. By 2050 annual softwood lumber
    production in the USA rises by about 1.1% in the climate and carbon dioxide scenario,
    imports fall by 1.1%.
  25: Yes, billions of 1982$ and percentage change are provided for different climate
    models and biogeochemistry models under dieback and regeneration scenarios.
  27: NPP increases in Canada range from 15% to 2~% (likely a typo for 20%) and softwood
    log production increases by 13-22%. NPP in the USA increases by 13-17%, whereas
    the log supply increases are less than 8%. Log supply in Finland and Sweden declines
    by 4-10%, even though softwood growth was projected to increase by 18-32%.
  28: "Global annual mean temperature in 2100 increases over the 1990 value about\
    \ 2.6\xB0C for the midrange scenario, 3.1\xB0C for the high emission scenario,\
    \ and 1.6\xB0C for the low emission scenario. Global price changes from -0.8%\
    \ to -3% and harvest changes from 1.5-2.7%."
  29: Under a high emission climate scenario, total welfare change ranges from $15
    billion to $15.8 billion (1993$). Under a moderate emission climate scenario,
    total welfare change is approximately $11.6 billion (1993$). Under a low emission
    climate scenario, total welfare change ranges from $1.8 billion to $3.9 billion
    (1993$). Aggregate price change ranges from -2.91% to -3.09% for the high emission
    scenario, from -2.30% to -2.44% for the moderate emission scenario, and from -0.83%
    to 0.86% for the low emission scenario. Harvest change ranges from 2.73% to 2.45%
    for the high emission scenario, from 2.36% to 2.20% for the moderate emission
    scenario, and from 1.49% to 1.49% for the low emission scenario.
  30: Forest area expands 22-29%, net market surplus is expected to increase 3-6.7%
    of the total value of the market, and plantations use short rotations of 10-20
    years.
  31: No relevant quantitative information on the outcomes of interest is provided.
