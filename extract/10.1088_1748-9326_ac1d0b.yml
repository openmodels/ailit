    climate impacts, discounting assumptions of future damages, climate extremes,
    inadequate future adaptation.

    floods), temperature rises, long-term temperature growth feedback on economic
    trajectories, mean annual temperature anomalies, permafrost carbon and surface
    albedo feedbacks.

    temperature variability

  12: Pulse size (total shock in Gt) of CO2 emissions; annual temperature variability.
  13: Changes in parameters like the tolerable temperature before a discontinuity
    occurs impact the SCCO2, affecting macroeconomic risks.
  14: Changes in climate model parameters such as transient climate response (tcr_transientresponse),
    time preference (ptp_timepreference), warming half-life (frt_warminghalflife),
    climate sensitivity parameters (impf_coeff_lin), carbon cycle parameters (a1_percentco2oceanlong),

    and other cryosphere elements
Highlights:
  2: PAGE-ICE yields higher SCCO2 values than PAGE09 due to climate and economic updates,
    with economy feedbacks resulting in a manifold increase in SCCO2. Higher damages
    are primarily in the Global South. Temperature variability increases the uncertainty
    of SCCO2. Climate-economy feedbacks and climate extremes are essential for estimating
    the SCCO2.
  3: Climate-economy models risk underestimating the SCCO2 by omitting features like
    climatic extremes and convex regional temperature damage functions. The effect
    of long-term persistence of climate impacts can significantly increase the SCCO2.
  4: PAGE-ICE model includes a more detailed representation of CO2 and CH4 sinks,
    permafrost carbon feedback, the effect of sea ice and land snow decline on surface
    albedo, and a fat-tailed distribution of sea level rise; Market damages were recalibrated
    to an empirical estimate based on temperatures; Model extended with the possibility
    of persistent climate-induced damages
  5: Implements a persistence parameter for economic damages, exploring the impact
    of future adaptation on reducing the persistence of temperature impacts on GDP,
    models annual temperature variability and incorporates it into the PAGE model.
  6: The increase in the mean SCCO2 is primarily attributed to social costs in the
    Global South, affecting regional GDP distribution significantly.
  7: Persistence of climate change impacts leads to a considerable redistribution
    of income to the detriment of poorer regions; high levels of damage persistence
    can lead to economic contraction in the Global South; the Social Cost of Carbon
    is highly sensitive to the persistence of damages.
  8: "Adaptation is crucial to reduce the SCCO2; High persistence of damages combined\
    \ with low or no adaptation leads to a substantial share of Monte Carlo runs producing\
    \ SCCO2 estimates of zero, meaning that the methodological decision behind PAGE-ICE\u2019\
    s damage cap increasingly dominates the model results; Current adaptation levels\
    \ are assumed to remain at levels observed hitherto."
  9: Interannual temperature variability widens the tails of the SCCO2 distributions,
    indicating increased uncertainty and potential for higher damages; Different damage
    modules (Discontinuity, Market, Non-economic) are affected differently, with varying
    GDP impacts.
  10: Temperature variability affects extremes and corrections in SCCO2 estimates;
    damage persistence is crucial for accurate SCCO2, especially for warmer, lower-income
    regions which suggests an underestimation of the cost in previous models.
  12: SCCO2 estimates vary significantly depending on the model variant and the presence
    of annual temperature variability. Models suggest stabilization or modest declines
    in SCCO2 as pulse size increases beyond 50 Gt CO2.
  13: A one standard deviation decrease in the tolerable temperature before a discontinuity
    leads to a substantial increase in the SCCO2.
  14: The transient climate response (tcr_transientresponse) has the largest positive
    impact on SCCO2 when increased by one standard deviation. Time preference (ptp_timepreference)
    has the largest negative impact on SCCO2 when increased by one standard deviation.
    Tolerability of discontinuity (tdis_tolerabilitydisc) has by far the largest positive
    impact on SCCO2 when *decreased* by one standard deviation, triggering a discontinuity.
  16: The SCCO2 estimates vary significantly based on the SSP scenario and model specifications,
    highlighting the uncertainty in quantifying climate change impacts. Incorporating
    growth effects and temperature variability in the PAGE model results in a wide
    range of SCCO2 estimates, with some distributions including values of zero due
    to damages falling outside the model's predefined scope.
  17: Damage persistence can have catastrophic impacts on welfare. The paper introduces
    boundaries for economic collapse and equity weighting to prevent infinite damages.
    Overall damage estimates are highly sensitive to the level of equity weighting.
  18: The persistence of economic damages due to temperature shocks is analyzed, with
    a focus on immediate versus long-run impacts.
  19: Damage persistence is sensitive to the number of temperature lags included in
    the regression model; Higher numbers of lags suggest lower persistence, but also
    introduce more noise.
  20: "The table shows the impact of temperature and temperature squared terms (and\
    \ their lags) on GDP per capita growth, with varying numbers of temperature lags\
    \ included in the model. The resulting persistence (\u03C1) varies depending on\
    \ the number of lags included."
  21: "The effect of damage persistence (\u03C1) on regional GDP is quantified using\
    \ Monte Carlo simulations and shown in Figure B5 for different model years under\
    \ the SSP2-4.5 climate scenario."
  22: Low-pass filtering yields higher temperature persistence, leading to more frequent
    occurrences of zero SCCO2 in Monte Carlo simulations and decreased mean SCCO2.
  23: Temperature has a statistically significant positive effect on GDP per capita
    growth in unfiltered and 3-year filtered data, but the significance diminishes
    with longer filters. Temperature squared has a statistically significant negative
    effect in unfiltered and 3-year filtered data. Persistence estimates vary depending
    on the filter used.
  24: The table suggests that the impact of temperature on GDPpc growth varies depending
    on the number of temperature lags included in the model. The resulting rho values
    shows the different levels of persistence, some of which are negative.
  25: Temperature and temperature squared have statistically significant impacts on
    GDP growth in some models; Lagged temperature effects are generally negative.
    Persistence of temperature effects on GDP is quantified. The results are driven
    by persistence in regions with lower GDP per capita.
  26: Temperature and temperature squared are statistically significant predictors
    of GDP per capita growth in some models, particularly when GDP per capita is above
    the median (Table B6, unfiltered).
  27: Adaptation efforts, by reducing damage persistence, can significantly reduce
    the estimated marginal damages of CO2 emissions and the SCCO2. The degree of damage
    persistence is a key driver of the SCCO2 estimate.
  28: Finds strongly positive changes in interannual temperature variability over
    the tropics, especially over Amazonia, with little increase in variability over
    Europe. Does not find global or PAGE-ICE region-specific evidence that justifies
    increasing or decreasing temperature variability with rising global temperatures
    in simulations.
  30: The alternative temperature model reduces the variance of residuals, and impacts
    on the SCCO2 are shown in table A4.
  31: The table presents regression results, showing the relationship between regional
    temperature, global mean surface temperature, and an unspecified dependent variable
    for different regions. Statistical significance is indicated by asterisks.
  33: Several papers analyze the impact of temperature changes, climate extremes,
    and climate change on economic outcomes like GDP and growth.
Methodology:
  2: Compares the PAGE-ICE model with the PAGE09 model. Extends PAGE-ICE with economy
    feedbacks and includes an estimate of interannual temperature variability. Uses
    empirically derived estimates of partially persistent economic damages.
  3: Uses cost-benefit integrated assessment models (CB-IAMs), specifically the PAGE-ICE
    model. Also couples empirical temperature-damage functions with variable, autoregressive
    interannual temperatures.
  4: Uses PAGE-ICE model, a integrated assessment model; Monte Carlo sampling of over
    150 parameter distributions; SC-CO2 calculated as the difference in global equity-weighted
    damages between runs with and without a CO2 pulse; Market damages are calculated
    based on absolute temperature; Model is run under different Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSPs)
  5: Uses the PAGE-ICE model, implements persistence parameter following Estrada et
    al (2015), uses Bayesian MCMC system (Stan) for fitting convergence and decay
    rates, applies exponential and linear interpolation for annualization, estimates
    long-run marginal impact using temperature lags and low-pass filtering.
  6: Analysis based on panel regression of historical temperature and GDP data, and
    Monte Carlo simulations involving 50,000 runs.
  7: "Uses the PAGE-ICE model incorporating growth effects, Monte Carlo simulations\
    \ are performed under different persistence scenarios, and results are presented\
    \ for both fixed persistence levels and an empirically derived persistence distribution\
    \ based on Burke et al. (2015). The subsistence level is derived from the World\
    \ Bank\u2019s international poverty line. The model caps total climate change\
    \ damages at a statistical value of society ($6.13 \xD7 10^16)."
  8: Monte Carlo simulations using the PAGE-ICE model with variations in persistence
    and adaptation rates; Empirical persistence distribution derived from historical
    data; Explores the effect of adaptation reducing damage persistence at a constant
    annual rate; Implementation of stochastic annual regional temperatures.
  9: Uses the PAGE model (Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect) with Monte Carlo
    simulations. The results are applicable for scenarios like SSP2-4.5 and specific
    climate and socioeconomic combinations.
  10: The use of PAGE with annual temperature anomalies and a global model of damage
    persistence is employed, with a call for increased scrutiny on assumptions of
    zero persistence in CB-IAMs.
  11: The PAGE model is run twice, with one run based on the exogenous emission scenario
    and the second run adding a CO2 pulse in the first model time step in 2020.
  12: Monte Carlo simulations (50,000 runs) using PAGE-ICE and Mimi-PAGE models. Annualization
    of the PAGE model via interpolation of variables like population, sea level, abatement
    costs, GDP, and emissions growth rates.
  13: The analysis uses a deterministic run of the PAGE-ICE model for SSP2-4.5, comparing
    the mean SCCO2 and the SCCO2 with a parameter value increased or decreased by
    one standard deviation.
  14: The analysis is based on the PAGE-ICE model under the SSP2-4.5 scenario using
    a deterministic run. The SCCO2 impact is calculated as the difference between
    the SCCO2 at the mean parameter value and the SCCO2 when the parameter is perturbed
    by one standard deviation, holding all other parameters at their default values.
    Monte Carlo distributions are used to define parameter uncertainty.
  16: "The SCCO2 values are based on 50,000 Monte Carlo runs. The PAGE model is used\
    \ with variations in temperature variability, growth effects, and persistence\
    \ of damages. A persistence parameter (\u03C1) is introduced to model the share\
    \ of economic damages affecting the GDP growth rate. A subsistence bound is introduced\
    \ at per capita consumption equal to the World Bank threshold for extreme poverty,\
    \ limiting equity weighting to damages less than or equal to 99% of consumption."
  17: Uses the PAGE-ICE integrated assessment model; Monte Carlo simulations; Introduces
    boundaries for economic collapse (subsistence level) and equity-weighting to avoid
    infinite damages; Applies logistic paths for convergence to these boundaries to
    smooth out discontinuities.
  18: Fixed effects regression models are used to analyze economic growth on temperature
    and other variables; persistence of temperature impacts is discussed with lag
    models and quadratic models.
  19: Regression analysis of GDP per capita growth on temperature, using the Burke
    et al (2015) regression with temperature lags; Monte Carlo simulations using a
    Multivariate Gaussian distribution; Butterworth low-pass filter applied to climate
    variables.
  20: The analysis uses a regression model based on Burke et al. (2015) with country
    and year fixed effects and country-specific time trends. It includes temperature
    and precipitation lags. A low-pass filter is applied to temperature and precipitation
    data to analyze persistence. The results are applicable to understanding the relationship
    between temperature changes and GDP per capita growth at a national level.
  21: Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate regional GDP levels. Bootstrapping
    (drawing with replacement from country clusters to create 5000 bootstrap samples)
    is mentioned in relation to handling empirical persistence distributions.
  22: The analysis uses a bootstrapping method and low-pass Butterworth filtering
    to test temperature persistence on macroeconomic impacts.
  23: Regression analysis using data from Burke et al. (2015), with low-pass filters
    applied to temperature data. Standard errors are clustered at the country level,
    and persistence percentiles are estimated via cluster bootstrap samples. Analysis
    is performed on global panel data.
  24: The analysis uses a regression model based on Burke et al. (2015) with country
    and year fixed effects, and country-specific time trends, analyzing the effect
    of temperature and precipitation (including lags) on GDPpc growth for countries
    with GDPpc below the median. Different models include varying numbers of temperature
    lags (up to 5). The results are applicable to understanding the short-term and
    persistent impact of temperature on economic growth in lower-income countries.
  25: Baseline regression model based on Burke et al. (2015) for countries with GDP
    per capita above the median, with varying numbers of temperature lags; Includes
    precipitation, country, and year fixed effects, as well as country-specific time
    trends; Regression model containing k temperature lags also features k precipitation
    lags. Monte Carlo simulations are also performed.
  26: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression with country-level clustered standard
    errors. Data from Burke et al. (2015). Analysis is split by GDP per capita median
    (above and below). Low-pass filters of 3, 5, and 10 years are applied to the climate
    variables in separate regressions. Bootstrap samples are used to calculate percentiles.
  27: Uses the PAGE-ICE model, Monte Carlo simulations, and empirical data to estimate
    damage persistence and SCCO2. Explores the impact of varying decay rates of damage
    persistence on SCCO2 estimates under SSP2-4.5. Historical temperature data is
    from Ilyas et al (2017), a variant of HadCRUT4. Computes interannual temperature
    variability as the long-term average of the 11-year standard deviations after
    detrending the annual temperature anomaly data.
  28: Uses HadCRUT4 grid, applies a land-sea mask and multiplies by the cosine of
    the latitude. Annual mean temperatures are calculated for PAGE-ICE regions by
    spatial aggregation. A 30-year running window is used for linear detrending. Autoregressive
    temperature model is used to decompose annual temperature variability into autocorrelation,
    smooth trends, and random variability using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing
    (LOESS).
  30: Regression models with different specifications for temperature trends (simple
    trend, CO2 concentrations, LOESS of observed GMST), autoregressive temperature
    model simulations. An alternative temperature model without auto-regression is
    specified for each region.
  31: Autoregressive model by region.
  32: The analysis mentions different models used to assess temperature effects, such
    as the 'Raw Temperatures' treating all variations as model errors, and other models
    regressing region temperatures on smoothed or delayed GMST.
  33: Panel analysis, integrated assessment models (PAGE, Mimi-PAGE), scenario model
    intercomparison projects (ScenarioMIP).
  34: Calculating the social cost of carbon
More Notes:
  2: The SCCO2 is used as an indicator of the urgency for climate action. Current
    policy recommendations vary widely, highlighting uncertainties in SCCO2 estimation.
    The study emphasizes the importance of robust quantification of climate-economy
    feedbacks and climate extremes for estimating the SCCO2 and its uncertainty.
  3: CB-IAMs often undervalue the impacts of climate change due to simple representations
    of climate and economy feedbacks. The PAGE-ICE model builds on PAGE09 and includes
    detailed models of Arctic feedbacks. The study aims to quantify the effect on
    SCCO2 of including possible long-term temperature growth feedback on economic
    trajectories, mean annual temperature anomalies, and already modeled permafrost
    carbon and surface albedo feedbacks.
  4: The PAGE-ICE model has been translated into the Mimi modeling framework
  5: The study models both global and regional temperature variability as a function
    of mean temperature and incorporates an autoregressive component. The persistence
    of damages is assumed to be similar in each region.
  7: The model caps total climate change damages, which can lead to a decrease in
    the SCCO2 at high persistence levels because an additional tonne of CO2 leads
    to no increase in overall damages when the cap is reached.
  8: The effect of adaptation reducing damage persistence over time is calculated
    for SSP2-RCP4.5; Substantial increase in the SCCO2 is primarily driven by the
    adverse implications for the Global South; The analysis implicitly assumes that
    future adaptation will remain at the levels observed hitherto for economic damages;
    The bottom-right corner of figure 4 is greyed out to highlight that SCCO2 results
    are primarily driven by the effects of the damage cap; The study recognizes that
    current temperature-induced damages and their persistence are derived from historical
    data lacking evidence of increasing resilience to temperature shocks over time.
  9: The analysis considers the interaction of temperature variability with the convex
    empirical temperature-damage function. Different PAGE model configurations are
    used (PAGE09, PAGE-ICE, with and without growth effects and interannual variability).
  10: Future research should focus on growth effects in the Global South and on advancing
    the understanding of damage persistence and adaptation mechanisms.
  11: The study extrapolates population and income levels past 2100 using a model
    based on growth rates, a rate of convergence, and a rate of decay. Sensitivity
    analysis is performed for the SCCO2.
  12: The PAGE model is composed of several modules for increased functionality and
    increased flexibility for future development and specific applications. The annualization
    is done to reduce modeling artifacts present in models with multi-year timesteps.
  14: The analysis focuses on the sensitivity of the SCCO2 to changes in specific
    model parameters. The direction of impact on SCCO2 changes depending on whether
    the parameter is increased or decreased by one standard deviation. The results
    are specific to the PAGE-ICE model and the SSP2-4.5 scenario and may not be generalizable
    to other models or scenarios.
  16: The alternative variability model features regional temperatures that vary independently.
    The growth effect is introduced as a share of damages affecting capital stocks.
    The persistence of damages is specified in various ways, including setting it
    to 0.05 or parametrizing it based on the relative magnitude between the immediate
    marginal impact of temperature on GDP growth to the cumulative effect over time.
  17: The damage function in Burke et al (2015) is expressed in % of GDP per capita,
    not % of GDP; The population is exogenous.
  19: "The ratio of long-run to immediate marginal impacts can approach infinity near\
    \ a specific temperature (around 13\xB0C using Burke et al (2015) coefficients);\
    \ The authors explore different methodologies to estimate persistence, including\
    \ low-pass filtering, due to uncertainties in lag selection."
  20: The analysis aims to derive an estimate of persistence to compare with other
    results, applying a low-pass filter to the temperature and precipitation observations.
    The authors discard countries with fewer than 20 years of data for the filtering.
  22: The study assumes global parameter persistence, recognizing potential variations
    due to regional heterogeneity and income levels.
  23: The analysis explores the persistence of climate impacts on GDP growth. The
    authors investigate potential spatial heterogeneity by dividing the sample into
    poorer and richer countries based on median PPP. They ultimately find inconclusive
    evidence for applying heterogeneous persistence in their model using a lag-based
    approach.
  24: "The table focuses on lower-income countries (GDPpc below the median). The persistence\
    \ parameter \u03C1 is calculated based on the temperature lag coefficients, potentially\
    \ reflecting the long-term impact of temperature shocks on economic growth. The\
    \ text references other tables (B5 and B6) that present results for higher-income\
    \ countries and use low-pass filters instead of temperature lags, showing that\
    \ poorer regions might be more vulnerable to persistent growth impacts of temperature\
    \ shocks."
  25: The analysis uses data provided by Burke et al. (2015).
  27: The analysis assumes that future damage persistence will equal persistence levels
    observed in the past decades unless adaptation efforts reduce vulnerability. The
    study acknowledges the uncertainty in how temperature damages might persist in
    future scenarios.
  28: "The study uses a longer time series and a more rigorous treatment of uncertainties\
    \ during interpolation than some previous studies. The results for the period\
    \ 1986\u20132015 are used. The median of the ensemble is used in the main model\
    \ specification."
  30: The document mentions an alternative temperature model without auto-regression
    that considers observational uncertainties. It also states that the impacts of
    this alternative model on the SCCO2 are shown in table A4 (which is not included
    in the provided text).
  31: The table seems to explore the impact of temperature changes on some unspecified
    dependent variable, potentially related to economic or environmental outcomes,
    across different regions. The dependent variable needs further investigation.
  33: The page mainly consists of references to other papers; many of these may contain
    the quantitative and methodological details sought.

  2: PAGE-ICE yields SCCO2 values about two times higher than PAGE09. Economy feedbacks
    demonstrate a manifold increase in the SCCO2. Including interannual temperature
    variability increases the width of the SCCO2 distribution.

    to long-term persistence.
  4: Equity-weighted damages are discounted using a pure time preference rate of 1.03%
    (0.5%, 2.0%); 75 Gt pulse size in the first time period (mid-2017-2025), representing

    $349 and a 5%\u201395% range from $82\u2013$831."
  7: Mean global GDP in 2100 is 30% lower than the SSP2-4.5 growth path without persistence;
    by 2200, the mean growth loss due to persistence exceeds the GDP growth rate in
    the whole Global South; If 10% of economic damages persist via reduced growth,
    the mean SCCO2 increases fifteenfold.
  8: SCCO2 estimates are provided; A minimum 3% per year reduction in damage persistence
    would be needed to see a SCCO2 of less than $600; SCCO2 exceeds $5000 when persistence
    is 20% and decreases by 0.5% annually; Mean increase of SCCO2 of $21 (6.5%) for

    (PAGE-ICE, PAGE with/without annual temperature variability).
  14: The table provides the impact on the SCCO2 in 2020 ($2015) for a one standard
    deviation increase (Table A1) and decrease (Table A2) in various model parameters.
    The values range from -63.29 to 100.88 for parameter increases and from -82.96
    to 617.53 for parameter decreases.
  16: "Table A4 presents Social Cost of Carbon Dioxide (SCCO2) values under different\
    \ SSP scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5) and model variations.\
    \ SCCO2 is presented as Mean (25th\u201375th [5th\u201395th] percentile) in $/ton\
    \ of CO2. Models used include PAGE09, PAGE-ICE, PAGE with growth effects, PAGE\
    \ (annual temperatures) no variability, PAGE with annual variability, PAGE with\
    \ alternative annual variability model, PAGE (annual) with growth effects, PAGE\
    \ with annual variability and growth effects."
  17: "Subsistence level of per capita consumption: $740.65 (per year, 2015 USD),\
    \ Damage threshold for equity-weighting: 99% of per capita consumption, Equity-weighting\
    \ elasticity of marginal utility of consumption (\u03B7)"
  19: Damage persistence estimated at 52.8% based on one temperature lag; Persistence
    could be 27.8% with two lags and 10.3% with four lags; 90% confidence interval
    for persistence with two lags extends to -41%.
  20: "Table B1 presents regression results with coefficients for temperature and\
    \ temperature squared terms, as well as lagged temperature and lagged temperature\
    \ squared terms, on GDP per capita growth. The table also shows resulting \u03C1\
    \ (persistence), Monte Carlo percentiles, N (number of observations), BIC, and\
    \ LL for each regression model."
  21: "Figure B5 shows the effect of the damage persistence parameter on regional\
    \ GDP levels, with lines representing Monte Carlo mean values and shaded areas\
    \ representing the 5th\u201395th percentile."
  22: Monte Carlo mean SCCO2 decreases from $3372 under lag-based approach to $3025
    for distribution using low-pass filtering; 62% Monte Carlo runs had a SCCO2 of
    zero under lag-based approach, increasing to 69% with low-pass filtering.
  23: Table B2 presents regression results with coefficients for temperature and temperature
    squared on GDP per capita growth under different low-pass filters (unfiltered,
    3-year, 5-year, 10-year). Includes t-statistics, resulting persistence (rho) estimates,
    5th and 95th percentiles of persistence, N, BIC, and log-likelihood.
  24: Table B3 presents coefficients for temperature variables in a regression model
    predicting GDPpc growth. These coefficients, along with their t-statistics, quantify
    the relationship between temperature and economic growth. Resulting rho values
    show different levels of persistence. For example, in model (1) with no temperature
    lags, the coefficient for temperature is 0.0236 (t=1.34) and for temperature squared
    is -0.0007 (t=-1.89), while the persistence is 100%. Other model variants include
    temperature lags and present different coefficient values and persistence estimates.
  25: "Temperature coefficients on GDP growth, including lagged effects and squared\
    \ terms; Resulting persistence (\u03C1); 5th and 95th Monte Carlo percentiles\
    \ of persistence; BIC and log-likelihood values for different models."
  27: "SCCO2 estimates under different annual decay rates of damage persistence: SCCO2\
    \ equals $305\u2013312 with a 4%-5% decay rate, which is identical to the PAGE-ICE\
    \ model with no persistence; A 1% or 2% decay rate counterintuitively increases\
    \ the SCCO2 compared to the default with zero decay from $3372 to $6595 or $4094."
  28: Standard deviations of interannual mean temperatures are calculated over 11-year
    detrended periods before and after 1986. Regression models of temperature showing
    autocorrelation levels are included.
  30: "R-squared values for different models (ranging from 0.652 to 0.862), residual\
    \ standard error (ranging from 0.130 to 0.206), coefficients for Year, GMSTt-1,\
    \ CO2(ppm), and LOESS in different models, standard deviations on the mean annual\
    \ temperature (\xB5), and the standard deviation capturing the uncertainty in\
    \ the 10000 member ensemble (\u2206)."
  31: There are quantitative estimates for the relationship between Reg.Temp, GMST,
    and a Constant for different regions (Oth, Lat, Afr+, Ind+, USA, Rus+, EU). The
    table also shows R-squared values and other statistical measures.
  33: Social cost of carbon estimates, temperature variability effects on economic
    growth.
