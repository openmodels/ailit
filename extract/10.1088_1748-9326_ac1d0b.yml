Drivers of Risk:
  2: The paper considers climate feedbacks, economy feedbacks (partially persistent
    economic damages), and interannual temperature variability as drivers impacting
    the SCCO2.
  3: The study investigates the impact of long-term temperature growth feedback on
    economic trajectories, mean annual temperature anomalies, and permafrost carbon
    and surface albedo feedbacks on the SCCO2. It also considers interannual climate
    variability, including extreme weather events like extreme rainfall, floods, and
    daily minimum/maximum temperatures.
  4: Rising temperatures, sea-level rise, climate tipping points, and permafrost carbon
    feedback.
  5: Annualized temperatures for calculating damages; global climatic mean temperatures
    for sea-level rise damages; magnitude of interannual temperature variability
  6: Climate feedbacks (CO2 model updates, climate sensitivity, sea-level rise, permafrost,
    surface albedo decline) and economic factors (baseline income levels, vulnerability
    of regions, persistence of economic damages).
  7: Damage persistence (the degree to which economic damages persist via reduced
    growth) and incremental CO2 pulse.
  8: Temperature-induced economic damages, persistence of these damages, and annual
    temperature variability.
  9: The analysis examines the impact of interannual temperature variability on climate
    damages.
  11: CO2 pulse size is a key factor in determining changes in the Social Cost of
    Carbon Dioxide (SCCO2).
  13: Changes in various parameters of the PAGE-ICE model, specifically increases
    or decreases by one standard deviation. One example provided is the tolerable
    temperature before a discontinuity occurs.
  14: Model parameters within the PAGE-ICE model such as transient climate response
    (tcr_transientresponse), time preference (ptp_timepreference), warming half-life
    (frt_warminghalflife), climate sensitivity (tcr), sea level rise parameters (sltemp_SLtemprise,
    sltau_SLresponsetime), and impact function parameters (impf_coeff_lin, pow_NonMarketExponent,
    emuc_utilityconvexity, etc.)

Highlights:
  2: Robust quantification of climate-economy feedbacks and climate extremes are essential
    for estimating the SCCO2 and its uncertainty.
  3: The study aims to quantify the magnitude and uncertainties of the contribution
    of climate and economy feedbacks and interannual variability to the SCCO2.
  4: PAGE-ICE includes a more detailed representation of CO2 and CH4 sinks, permafrost
    carbon feedback, the effect of sea ice and land snow decline on surface albedo,
    and a fat-tailed distribution of sea-level rise. Also considers interannual temperature
    variability. It also extends PAGE-ICE with the possibility of persistent climate-induced
    damages, which in turn affects GDP pathways and scales emissions accordingly.
  6: The mean SCCO2 for PAGE-ICE is double the value for PAGE09. This increase is
    attributed almost entirely to increased social costs in the Global South. Introducing
    empirically derived level of damage persistence affects both the size of global
    GDP and its regional distribution by vast amounts, dominating the effect of any
    other modeling choice.
  7: Damage persistence leads to a considerable redistribution of income to the detriment
    of poorer regions. Higher levels of damage persistence can cause economic contraction
    in the Global South.  The model estimates of the SCCO2 decrease for higher levels
    of persistence due to a cap on total climate damages.
  8: Adaptation reducing damage persistence over time can significantly lower the
    SCCO2. Reducing persistence of temperature-related economic impacts by at least
    3% per year could reduce the SCCO2 to below $600. Adding temperature variability
    widens the SCCO2 uncertainty ranges and can lead to higher mean damages.
  9: Interannual temperature variability widens the distribution tails of the SCCO2,
    potentially increasing climate damages.
  13: A one standard deviation *decrease* in the tolerable temperature before a discontinuity
    occurs triggers the discontinuity in the PAGE-ICE model, leading to a substantial
    *increase* in the SCCO2.
  14: Table A1 shows that the transient climate response (tcr_transientresponse) has
    the largest positive impact on the SCCO2 when increased by one standard deviation,
    while time preference (ptp_timepreference) has the largest negative impact. Table
    A2 shows that the tolerability of discontinuity (tdis_tolerabilitydisc) has by
    far the largest positive impact on the SCCO2 when decreased by one standard deviation,
    while transient climate response (tcr_transientresponse) has the largest negative
    impact.
  17: Damage persistence can have catastrophic impacts on the welfare of regions,
    to the extent that some regions approach zero consumption.
  18: Damages from temperature shocks may not be fully persistent over time, leading
    to compensating impacts in subsequent years; the magnitude of damage persistence
    can be estimated using lagged temperature terms in regression models.
  19: Damage persistence is sensitive to the number of lags included in the regression
    model. Including more lags reduces the point estimate of damage persistence, but
    also increases the variance and uncertainty of the estimate.
  20: The table presents the coefficients for temperature variables that factor into
    estimates of damage persistence and the resulting persistence estimates.
  23: "Temperature and Temperature squared are statistically significant (p < 0.001)\
    \ predictors of GDP per capita growth when using unfiltered climate variables.\
    \ As filters are applied, the statistical significance decreases. Point estimates\
    \ for the persistence parameter \u03C1 in the poorer and richer subsample are\
    \ 42.48% and 61.97%, respectively. Confidence intervals for the two subsamples\
    \ are considerably wider compared to the full sample."
  24: Lower-income regions may be more vulnerable to persistent growth impacts from
    temperature shocks, with evidence of substantial persistence levels.
  25: The table shows the impact of temperature and temperature squared (with lags)
    on GDPpc growth.
  26: Temperature and Temperature2 coefficients are statistically significant (p <
    0.05) for unfiltered data in both below and above median GDP per capita models.
    The effect of temperature on GDP per capita growth differs depending on whether
    a country is above or below the median GDP per capita.
  27: Increased adaptation efforts could limit the vulnerability of capital stocks
    to climate change, making the assumption of extrapolating previous damage persistence
    levels too pessimistic; Varying decay rates of damage persistence significantly
    impact the SCCO2 estimate.
  28: Finds strongly positive changes in local interannual mean temperature variability
    over the tropics, especially Amazonia, after 1986; sees little increase in variability
    over Europe; does not find global or PAGE-ICE region-specific evidence that justifies
    increasing or decreasing temperature variability with rising global temperatures
    in simulations.
  29: Controlling for a smoothed GMST predictor or an autoregressive term reduces
    average correlation of residuals across regions by half.
  33: Cost-benefit test of the Paris climate agreement, impact of day-to-day temperature
    variability on economic growth, selective reporting and the social cost of carbon.
Methodology:
  2: The paper compares the PAGE-ICE model with the older PAGE09 model and extends
    PAGE-ICE with economy feedbacks and an estimate of interannual temperature variability.
  3: The paper extends the PAGE-ICE CB-IAM model to quantify the effect of various
    factors on the SCCO2. It incorporates empirical temperature-damage functions with
    variable, autoregressive interannual temperatures. The model simulates climatic
    and economic developments between 2020 and 2300 in eight aggregated regions.
  4: The PAGE-ICE model is run twice, once with the specified emission pathway and
    once with an additional CO2 pulse. The SCCO2 is calculated as the difference in
    global equity-weighted damages between the two runs, discounted to the base year
    (2015).
  5: PAGE model, using exponential/linear interpolation to annualize inputs.  Persistence
    of damages is implemented following Estrada et al (2015). Temperature variability
    is modeled as constant over time, using a recent spatially completed dataset (Ilyas
    et al 2017). Least-squares regression applied to historical temperatures to fit
    parameters.
  6: The study uses the PAGE-ICE model and Monte Carlo simulations (50,000 runs) under
    the SSP2-4.5 scenario to estimate the SCCO2. Panel regression analysis is used
    to estimate the persistence of economic damages.
  7: "Incorporates growth effects into the PAGE-ICE model, calculated for SSP2-RCP4.5.\
    \ Uses both fixed degrees of damage persistence (0%-100%) and an empirically derived\
    \ persistence distribution. The model caps total climate change damages to an\
    \ exogenous statistical value of society ($6.13 \xD7 10^16)."
  8: Monte Carlo simulations using the PAGE-ICE model, exploring the effects of adaptation
    rates on damage persistence. Results are calculated for 10% and 0.5% steps in
    persistence and adaptation rate respectively, and then interpolated for plotting
    purposes.
  9: The paper uses 50,000 Monte Carlo runs of the PAGE model configurations to analyze
    the effects of interannual temperature variability and report SCCO2 values with
    variability effects.
  11: Model code and documentation are available on GitHub, and the model uses Bayesian
    methods for projection and sensitivity analysis.
  13: The analysis is based on the default PAGE-ICE model for SSP2-4.5 (deterministic
    run). The impact of individual parameter changes (increased or decreased by one
    standard deviation) on the 2020 SCCO2 is calculated, holding other parameters
    at their default values. Monte Carlo distribution is used.
  14: The analysis is based on the default PAGE-ICE model for SSP2-4.5 (deterministic
    run). The SCCO2 impact is calculated as the difference between the SCCO2 for the
    mean of the parameter's Monte Carlo distribution and the SCCO2 for a parameter
    value equal to the mean value decreased (Table A2) or increased (Table A1) by
    one standard deviation. Results are only applicable for the specified model, scenario,
    and year (2020).
  15: The page presents parameters to a population and income extension model. These
    parameters appear to be applicable in analyses using SSP1-5 scenarios.
  16: The PAGE09 model and its variations are used to simulate different climatic
    and economic conditions affecting SCCO2, with adjustments for growth effects and
    temperature variability.
  17: The PAGE-ICE model is used with Monte Carlo simulations. Equity-weighting is
    applied to damages based on a region's consumption relative to the EU in 2015.
    Boundaries are introduced for economic collapse and equity-weighting and are smoothed
    using logistic paths.
  18: Fixed effects regressions of economic growth on temperature and other variables,
    including lagged temperature terms, to assess persistence of damages.
  19: Uses lagged regression models based on Burke et al. (2015) and a low-pass filter
    approach similar to Bastien-Olvera and Moore (2021) to estimate persistence. The
    lagged regression models estimate the ratio of long-run to immediate marginal
    impacts as the temperature goes to (minus) infinity.
  20: The analysis uses a baseline regression model based on Burke et al. (2015) with
    various numbers of temperature lags, precipitation, country, and year fixed effects,
    and country-specific time trends. Temperature and precipitation data is low-pass
    filtered, and GDP per capita growth is regressed on the filtered climate variables.
    Standard errors are clustered at the country level.
  21: Monte Carlo simulations, bootstrapping with country clusters to create 5000
    samples.
  23: Regression analysis of GDP per capita growth on temperature and temperature
    squared, using different low-pass filters on the climate variables. Persistence
    is estimated via cluster bootstrap samples. The analysis is based on data from
    Burke et al. (2015). The low pass filtering approach is also applied to income-based
    subsamples of the Burke et al (2015) data.
  24: Analysis uses baseline regression models incorporating temperature lags, precipitation,
    country, year fixed effects, and country-specific time trends.
  25: The analysis uses a baseline regression model similar to Burke et al. (2015),
    with country and year fixed effects, and country-specific time trends, for countries
    with GDP per capita above the median. The model includes temperature and precipitation
    lags. The results are author's calculations based on data provided by Burke et
    al. (2015).
  26: The analysis uses regressions with low-pass filtered climate variables, clustering
    standard errors at the country level, and uses data from Burke et al. (2015).
    The models are run separately for countries below and above the median GDP per
    capita.
  27: Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the SCCO2 under different annual
    decay rates of damage persistence for SSP2-4.5; Interannual temperature variability
    is computed as the long-term average of the 11 year standard deviations after
    detrending the annual temperature anomaly data using a local 11 year running mean.
  28: Calculates annual standard deviations of 11-year detrended temperature periods
    before and after 1986; uses a 30-year running window for linear detrending to
    remove the global warming signal; applies a land-sea mask and cosine of latitude
    for area-weighted temperature calculations.
  29: Residual temperature variation is assumed uncorrelated across regions after
    accounting for GMST and regional auto-regression.
  31: The analysis uses an autoregressive model by region. The table describes regression
    results.
  32: 'Four different models are used to analyze correlation in model errors across
    regions, with varying regressors: Raw Temperatures, LOESS-only Model, AR-only
    Model, and Full AR Model.'

    cost of carbon calculation, economic modelling
More Notes:
  4: "The choice of pulse size can affect SCCO2 estimates. Equity weighting of damages\
    \ is based on the approach by Anthoff et al (2009a) using a mean (minimum, maximum)\
    \ elasticity of marginal utility of consumption of 1.17 (0.1\u20132.0), and equity-weighted\
    \ damages are discounted using a pure time preference rate of 1.03% (0.5%, 2.0%)."
  5: The paper explores the simplification of using one global value for damage persistence,
    assuming it is similar in each region. Also rescales greenhouse gas emissions
    proportionally to changes in GDP.
  6: Values are expressed in $2015 USD throughout. The changes in SCCO2 are broken
    down into a series of key steps to show the impact of each update from PAGE09
    to PAGE-ICE.
  7: "The SCCO2 estimate is highly sensitive to equity weighting parameters and also\
    \ varies across methodologies.  One outlier run with a persistence draw of \u2212\
    6406% was omitted from Monte Carlo means of absolute GDP."
  13: The annual SCCO2 distributions differ from the original model due to changes
    in the discontinuity sector and the model design of PAGE09.
  14: The study focuses on the sensitivity of the SCCO2 to individual parameters within
    the PAGE-ICE model. The tables only display parameters with an absolute SCCO2
    impact of at least $2.
  15: The table provides coefficients for projecting population and GDP per capita
    under different SSP scenarios. Figure A5 provides a visual representation of extended
    SSP population and per capita GDP for SSP2 and SSP5, including 95% credible intervals.
  17: The paper discusses the importance of equity-weighting and how it can significantly
    impact the results.
  18: The approach allows for both linear and quadratic temperature effects.
  19: "The ratio of marginal impacts approaches infinity around 13\xB0C due to the\
    \ denominator approaching zero. They also explore an alternative method of using\
    \ low-pass filtering to estimate persistence."
  20: The study filters temperature and precipitation observations using a low-pass
    filter for minimum periodicities of 3, 5, and 10 years. Countries with less than
    twice the minimum periodicity of subsequent temperature/precipitation observations
    are discarded.
  23: The authors investigate the possibility of regional heterogeneity in persistence
    by applying low-pass filtering to income-based subsamples. The authors conclude
    that there might be regional differences in climate damage persistence, but they
    do not find clear evidence in this dataset for applying heterogeneous persistence
    under the lag-based approach in their model.
  24: The paper specifically notes differences in persistence estimates by income
    level, suggesting regional differentiation in vulnerability to temperature impacts.
  25: The study examines the persistence of climate impacts by using temperature lags
    (up to five years). It also assesses the sensitivity of the results to different
    assumptions about the vulnerability of rich regions to damage persistence.
  27: The study explores the theoretical possibility that damage persistence decays
    exponentially over time.
  28: Uses HadCRUT4 grid for temperature data; employs locally estimated scatterplot
    smoothing (LOESS) to represent the underlying climatic temperature; develops an
    autoregressive temperature model to decompose annual temperature variability into
    autocorrelation, smooth trends, and random variability.

    climate change, social cost of carbon, and climate policy. Several papers use
    integrated assessment models like PAGE to estimate the social cost of carbon.

  6: "The mean SCCO2 in 2020 from PAGE09 is $158 per tonne (in $2015 USD). Updating\

    \ feedback reduces the SCCO2 to $239. Reducing the size, threshold, and lag of\
