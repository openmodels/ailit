Drivers of Risk:
  1: Aging dynamics and increasing natural disasters
  3: Climate change, extreme weather events (flooding, hurricanes), natural disasters
    (earthquakes), demographic changes (aging, declining fertility rates).
  5: Age dependency, uncertainty (inflation, unemployment), climate-related risks
    (physical and transitory), interest-rate risk
  6: Aging population, changes in savings behavior, global warming, extreme weather,
    natural disasters.
  7: Natural disasters (earthquakes, tsunamis, floods). Government financial assistance
    after disasters.
  9: Demographic change affects savings rates, tax rates, population growth, the growth
    rate of knowledge, and the old-age dependency ratio.
  10: Climate change leading to more disaster days and increasing depreciation of
    capital.
  11: Natural disasters are used as a proxy for potential impact, measured by the
    number of days of disasters.
  12: Natural disasters, old-age dependency ratio.
  13: Real long-term interest rate, Old-age dependency ratio, Per capita income, Days
    of natural disasters.
  15: Climate change (measured by number of disaster days), old-age dependency ratio
  16: Natural disasters, climate change, aging population
  19: Financial development, carbon emissions, spatially dependent panel data, serial
    correlation, risk aversion, unemployment insurance, aging population, earthquakes,
    natural disasters, climate change.
  20: Natural disasters, population aging
Highlights:
  3: Natural disasters, especially longer durations, are associated with lower savings
    ratios. Successful climate policy could raise global savings ratios.
  5: Savings behavior is related to risks and uncertainty, which threatens the welfare
    of the economy; uncertainties arising from demographic change and climate-related
    risks could significantly impact savings behavior.
  6: Aging population may reduce per capita CO2 emissions and increase market capitalization,
    which can positively impact green innovation.
  7: Natural disasters can significantly impact savings rates, but the direction and
    magnitude of the impact are country- and event-specific. Government assistance
    can dampen savings motives.
  9: Demographic changes will flatten the growth path, affecting both its trend and
    level, depending on variable strengths.
  10: Increased climate disaster days and damages could decrease savings ratio and
    raise capital depreciation.
  13: Real long-term interest rates and old-age dependency ratios are negatively associated
    with savings rates, while per capita income has a positive impact. Natural disasters
    negatively impact savings rates.
  15: Climate change (number of disaster days) has a negative impact on savings rates
    in OECD countries. The relationship between the old-age dependency ratio and savings
    rate shifts from negative to positive around the time of the global financial
    crisis (2007).
  16: Climate policy (reducing natural disaster frequency) can raise global savings
    ratio, affecting the cost of capital and the cost of global modernization for
    sustainability and climate neutrality. Higher private savings are beneficial for
    aging societies, greening the economy, and economic prosperity.
  19: Several papers analyze the relationship between finance and carbon emissions,
    the impact of disasters on savings behavior, and the effects of population aging
    on CO2 emissions.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis uses econometric methods applicable to OECD countries.
  3: Empirical analysis examining the impact of demographic changes and natural disasters
    on savings ratios.
  5: Literature review of empirical studies on savings rates and factors influencing
    them.
  6: Panel data analysis of 25 OECD member countries and household data analysis.
  7: Cross-country empirical analysis, household datasets, counterfactual methods,
    panel dataset analysis, enhanced neoclassical Solow model.
  10: Uses panel data analysis with fixed-effects on 34 OECD countries from 1980 to
    2020.
  11: "Data from 34 OECD countries over the period 1980\u20132020 is analyzed using\
    \ macro-panels; methods include panel unit root tests, Chow tests, fixed-effects\
    \ and random effects models, and Hausman specification tests."
  12: Long-term effects are considered. Uses variables like real long-term savings,
    depreciation.
  13: Panel data regression with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors to account for cross-sectional
    dependence, heteroscedasticity, and autocorrelation. Analysis applies to OECD
    countries over the period 1980-2020 (based on text in page and the referenced
    table).
  15: Empirical analysis of OECD countries from 1980 to 2020. Models use 20 EU countries
    as a subset. Significance levels are mentioned (5% and 10%).
  16: Theoretical model of a closed economy; empirical analysis (likely econometric
    given mention of dynamic panel analysis and endogeneity).  The empirical part
    can be improved with a dynamic panel analysis.
  19: Panel data analysis, econometrics, statistical modeling, literature reviews.
  20: Econometric analysis of cross section and panel data
More Notes:
  3: The analysis focuses on OECD countries and considers the impact of both climate-related
    and demographic factors on savings ratios. The relationship between savings ratios
    and the cost of capital and modernization is highlighted.
  5: The literature suggests that both demographic change (aging society) and climate-related
    risks are important factors influencing savings behavior.
  7: Japan might be an outlier in natural disaster savings behaviour due to cultural
    and demographic characteristics. There is a need to expand empirical knowledge
    on disaster-related savings behavior across countries.
  12: The page presents a table describing variables used in a potential analysis.
    It mentions data sources OECD, UN, and EM-DAT.
  13: The analysis seems to focus on factors influencing savings rates, with some
    factors indirectly related to climate change.
  16: Government aid behaviour might reduce household willingness to insure against
    natural disasters, which could influence the savings rate as measured in national
    accounts.
  19: The page contains a bibliography of papers. Several papers examine micro-level
    responses to macroeconomic shocks like earthquakes and unemployment.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Savings ratios
  3: Savings ratios, cost of capital, cost of global modernization, decline of accumulation
    of physical assets, negative income shocks.
  5: Savings rates, welfare of the economy
  6: Aging population affects household portfolio structures and capital markets,
    which can influence corporate governance and capital allocation.
  7: Savings rates are impacted by natural disasters. Physical capital investment
    decreases with higher disaster risks. Government financial assistance following
    a catastrophic event can lead to distortions in the insurance market.
  9: Trend growth rates of output are affected by the growth rate of knowledge and
    the old-age dependency ratio.
  10: Theoretical analysis discusses the effect of higher climate disaster days and
    depreciation rates on savings ratios and growth paths.
  12: GDP per head of population, GDP loss due to natural disasters, old-age dependency
    ratio, income inequality.
  13: Savings rate.
  15: Savings rate
  16: Economic growth path, savings rate, cost of capital, cost of global modernization
  19: Household saving, CO2 emissions, unemployment, economic openness.
  20: Long-run growth, household saving rates
Quantitative material:
  3: The empirical evidence suggests that the savings rate falls if natural disasters
    are rising in terms of the number of days duration.
  7: "The 2008 Sichuan earthquake caused declines in household saving rates\u2014\
    from 24\u20137% and from 23\u201321% for rural and urban populations, respectively."
  12: "Annual loss to GDP from natural disasters, old-age dependency ratio [(65+)\
    \ / 20\u201364] (%)."
  13: A 1% change in the real long-term interest rate leads to a decrease of 0.2-0.3%
    in the savings rate (P < 0.01). One-percent increase of the old-age dependency
    ratio is associated with a 0.36% decrease of the savings rate. Each additional
    day increase in disasters is expected to reduce the savings rate by 0.02 (p <
    0.05) and 0.01 (p < 0.05) percent.
