Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased typhoon intensity due to increasing levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs)
  2: Climate change-induced increases in tropical cyclone intensity are a driver of
    risk.
  4: Increases in tropical cyclone intensity due to climate change; specifically,
    the impact of increased CO2 concentrations (reaching 2.2 times the 2004 level
    by 2085) is assessed based on the work of Knutson & Tuleya (2004).
  6: Climate change-induced increases in cyclone intensity.
  7: Global warming and increased cyclone activity leading to housing damage.
Highlights:
  1: Increased typhoon intensity will have significant effects on damage to housing
    in the Philippines, necessitating increased resilience of local communities.
  2: The study focuses on the less studied case of the Philippines.
  6: The amount of time wind speed is > 50 kn is linked to housing damage.
  7: Future tropical cyclones could significantly increase housing damage in the Philippines;
    in worst-affected regions, damage could rise to 30-36 houses per 1000 inhabitants.
Methodology:
  1: Monte Carlo simulation that magnifies the intensity of historical tropical cyclones
    between the years 1978 and 2008.
  2: The paper applies techniques from other studies to the case of the Philippines
    to estimate how potential climate change-induced increases in tropical cyclone
    intensity can affect damages to housing.
  4: "A Monte Carlo simulation, building on Esteban et al. (2010), is used to estimate\
    \ the 'Expected Affected Time' (\u02C6\u03D1) an area is under the influence of\
    \ wind of a certain strength in 1 future year."
  6: Regression analysis performed on 5 super-regions of the Philippines (grouping
    17 regions), relating hours affected by 50 kn winds to housing damage for the
    period 2003-2008, assuming adaptive capacity is constant over the short run. Can
    be used to estimate potential increases in housing damage in the Philippines by
    2085.
  7: The study derives wind damage functions from limited historical data to estimate
    future cyclone damage to housing; results are applicable to regions of the Philippines.
More Notes:
  1: The simulation assumes the adaptive capacity of each region in the Philippines
    remains constant between now and 2085.
  4: "The model is considered conservative, potentially underestimating the consequences\
    \ of climate change due to its assumptions. Only historical cyclone tracks after\
    \ 1977 are used, providing 30 years of data. The likely onset of damage for tropical\
    \ cyclones in the Philippines is a wind of \u2265 50 knots. The simulation selects\
    \ random historical cyclone tracks from 1978-2008 for each generated cyclone."
  6: The adaptive capacity of the regions is factored into the analysis, although
    assumed constant across time in the short run. The model can indirectly take into
    account the effect of maximum wind speeds.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Direct damage to housing
  2: Damages to housing due to tropical cyclones is a macroeconomic outcome of interest.
  6: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: Direct damage to housing could increase between 17 and 58 % by the year 2085,
    depending on the adaptive capacity of each region in the Philippines.
  4: "The simulation uses N = 5000 runs to achieve > 99% accuracy and generates a\
    \ random number of tropical cyclones for each month based on probability distribution\
    \ parameters (mean and SD) derived from historical storm data (1971-2006) from\
    \ the Japan Meteorological Agency. Table 1 lists the probability distribution\
    \ functions (Normal, SD) of number of tropical cyclones month\u20131 from January\
    \ through December."
  6: Db= a1T50 + e (where Db is number of buildings affected per 1000 inhabitants,
    T50 is the number of hours a region is affected by 50 kn winds or higher, a1 is
    slope of trendline, e is the error). R2 values of 0.56, 0.24, 0.21 and 0.48 for
    4 regions.
  7: Table 2 provides expected percentage increases in housing damage for two climate
    change scenarios, with up to 58% increase in damage in the worst-case scenario.
