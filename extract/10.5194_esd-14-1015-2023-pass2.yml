Highlights:
  1: Majority of long-term damages are associated with impacts to human health, with
    regional disparities and potential for exacerbating societal inequalities.
  2: Presents annual damages over time and discusses the differential impacts projected
    to occur across different sectors, regions, and populations within CONUS borders.
  3: Uses probabilistic projections with a simple climate model to assess a rich range
    of uncertainty parameters.
  4: FrEDI calculates damages across 20 impact sectors on a significantly reduced
    time frame compared to existing models.
  5: FrEDI can compare climate-driven damages across different populations within
    the US, based on social vulnerability. Adaptation can both exacerbate and ameliorate
    future climate-driven damages, with the latter being more common.
  6: Climate-driven damages are largest for the health category, primarily from premature
    mortality attributable to temperature and air quality changes. By 2090, mean damages
    are estimated at $2.9 Trillion.
  7: The largest monetary damages are driven by premature mortality owing to temperature
    changes, followed by impacts on air quality, transportation, health damages from
    wildfires, and labor losses.
  8: The paper highlights that temperature-related mortality is the largest impact
    sector and adaptation options significantly affect projected damages.
  9: Largest monetary damages in 2090 are expected from premature mortality associated
    with changes in temperature. Some regions and sectors are projected to benefit
    from warming temperatures (e.g., reduction in air pollution-attributable mortality
    in the Midwest), but overall negative impacts outweigh positives.
  10: The top sectors contributing to climate-driven damages vary by region, including
    roads, rail, labor, agriculture, wildfire, high tide flooding, and air quality.
    The net present damages resulting from an additional tonne of CO2 emissions is
    calculated.
  12: Premature mortality from temperature changes dominates monetized damages; adaptation
    lacks explicit modeling options in FrEDI.
  13: FrEDI can assess differential climate impacts on socially vulnerable groups
    in 2090 and offers the ability to investigate adaptation options in select sectors.
    It highlights that proactive adaptation measures are often not implemented even
    when cost-effective.
  14: Temperature-related mortality shows the highest damage estimate (USD 2300 billion
    mean), followed by labor allocation damages (USD 51 billion mean), and wildfire
    air quality health effects (USD 51 billion mean).
  15: Projects increasing damages across most sectors by 2100, with coastal properties
    showing a sharp increase after 2080 due to sea level rise. Total damages increase
    significantly across all sectors.
  16: Adaptation strategies have the capacity to both exacerbate and ameliorate future
    climate-driven damages. Climate damages vary significantly across US regions.
    The top damage sectors vary greatly between regions (e.g., Air Quality & Wildfire
    in the Northwest vs. Labor & Wind Damage in the Southern Plains).
  17: Proactive adaptation generally leads to lower damage estimates compared to reactive
    or no adaptation across sectors.
  18: Temperature-related premature mortality damages vary widely depending on the
    underlying study and assumptions about adaptation.
  19: The key highlight is the strategy for extending climate impact estimations to
    2300, which is a longer timeframe than many climate impact assessments, providing
    insight into long-term impacts across various sectors.
  20: Most sectors show an increasing trend in impacts due to climate change, with
    varying degrees of severity. Some sectors, like temperature-related mortality,
    wildfire, and coastal properties, show particularly steep increases. Winter recreation
    shows a decline.
Methodology:
  1: Utilizes the Framework for Evaluating Damages and Impacts (FrEDI) model to project
    impacts across 10000 future scenarios.
  2: Uses FrEDI, which draws on over 30 climate change impact models from peer-reviewed
    studies to develop relationships between mean surface temperature change and climate-driven
    impacts across 20 sectors within US borders through the end of the 21st century.
    Uses 10000 paired probabilistic emissions and socioeconomic projections. Investigates
    the potential range of projected long-term annual climate change impacts associated
    with uncertainty in climate model parameters, future emissions and socioeconomic
    conditions, and structural uncertainty in select damage functions. Methodology
    extended to the year 2300 to assess the net present damage in the US resulting
    from an additional tonne of CO2, CH4, or N2O emissions.
  3: "Uses 10000 randomly sampled scenarios of global greenhouse gas emissions, US\
    \ population, and US GDP from the Resources for the Future\u2013Socioeconomic\
    \ Projections (RFF-SPs). Emission trajectories are input to the Finite Amplitude\
    \ Impulse Response (FaIR) model (v1.6.2) to estimate global mean surface temperature.\
    \ These temperature projections, along with population and GDP projections, are\
    \ passed to FrEDI (v3.0) to calculate climate-driven damages."
  4: The analysis uses the FaIR climate model to simulate CONUS temperature change
    as a function of global mean surface temperature, followed by FrEDI which calculates
    sectoral impacts using this temperature data along with regional GDP and population.
  5: The FrEDI model is extended to project climate damages out to 2300. This involves
    linearly extrapolating sector-specific, temperature-binned damage functions. 10000
    temperature and socioeconomic scenarios are run through FrEDI under baseline and
    perturbed (1GtC pulse of CO2, CH4, or N2O added in 2020) cases. Marginal annual
    damages are calculated as the difference between damages in the two cases and
    discounted to the year of emissions to obtain a net present-damage estimate. Differential
    climate-driven damages are calculated at the census tract level as a function
    of current population demographic patterns, projections of population, and projections
    of where climate-driven damages are projected to occur.
  6: "The analysis uses the FrEDI model with 10,000 baseline RFF-SP scenarios (emission,\
    \ population, and GDP trajectories) and Ramsey discounting calibrated to a near-term\
    \ target discount rate of 2% (\u03C1=0.2% and \u03B7=1.24)."
  8: The analysis considers different adaptation options for sectors like coastal
    property and assesses impacts using the FrEDI framework, which incorporates damage
    estimates across independent sectors.
  9: Uses 10,000 RFF-SP scenarios incorporating climate parameter uncertainty via
    a Monte Carlo approach with FaIR. Accounts for uncertainties in emission and socioeconomic
    projections, climate parameters, and damage functions.
  10: The analysis projects climate damages to 2300 and quantifies the net present
    damages within the US resulting from additional emissions using Ramsey discounting
    with target rates of 1.5%, 2.0%, and 2.5%. It uses SSP trajectories of emissions,
    US GDP, and US population. FrEDI is used to project climate damages.
  12: The analysis uses the FrEDI framework to estimate damages, incorporating US
    GDP, US population, and temperature changes.
  13: The paper describes the FrEDI model's framework, which allows for updates as
    new sectoral impact studies become available. The model incorporates adaptation
    assumptions from underlying sector studies, especially for coastal flooding where
    reactive and proactive adaptation scenarios are considered.
  14: The analysis estimates damages for the year 2090 under different adaptation
    scenarios. It uses a variety of models to determine damages, and appears to be
    for the United States.
  15: Uses binned damage functions and sector-specific scalars (e.g., per capita income-dependent
    VSL) to project damages. Slight discontinuities can occur at temperature bin boundaries
    or due to thresholds.
  16: The FrEDI model is used to explore sensitivity of climate damages to adaptation
    scenarios and other factors like CO2 fertilization and air quality. Scenarios
    include reactive and proactive adaptation strategies. The map uses 10,000 projections
    to compute mean annual damages for the year 2090 (non-discounted).
  17: "The FrEDI (Framework for Risk and Economic Assessment of Damages) model is\
    \ used. Damages were originally calibrated for temperatures from 0 to 6\u25E6\
    C relative to the 1986 to 2005 era and SLR for 21st century trajectories that\
    \ result in 30 to 250cm global mean sea level rise (GMSL) rise outcomes by 2100.\
    \ Beyond these ranges, temperature damages are extrapolated using the change in\
    \ damages between 5 and 6\u25E6C, and SLR damages are extrapolated based on the\
    \ damages per centimeter of SLR modeled by the two highest sea level scenarios\
    \ in 2090."
  18: Damages are estimated through 2300 by scaling based on population and GDP trajectories,
    applying year-specific adjustment factors, or no time-dependent adjustments. FrEDI
    framework incorporates socioeconomic drivers.  Extrapolation methods include linear
    extrapolation or holding constant at 2090 levels, based on trends from 2010-2090.
  19: The methodology involves extending FrEDI sectoral results from 2090 to 2300
    using different scaling approaches. Some impacts scale with population and/or
    GDP per capita. Others use year-specific adjustment factors based on population
    scenarios. Sea level rise impacts scale with GDP or GDP per capita. Temperature-driven
    impacts do not use time-dependent multipliers.
  20: The analysis projects sectoral damages from 2100 to 2300 across 10000 projections
    (this is obtained from the figure caption even if the primary graphs only show
    2010-2090). The figure shows impacts from 2010 to 2090.
More Notes:
  2: FrEDI is designed to be flexible and continually refined to incorporate advances
    in peer-reviewed economic damage functions, including new sectors and adaptation
    options.
  3: The FaIR calibration is consistent with the IPCC AR6 Working Group 1 assessment.
    The FrEDI model uses a temperature-binning approach and data from previously published
    climate impact studies to develop relationships between climate-driven changes
    and damages across 20 sectors.
  4: FrEDI disaggregates national data into regional projections holding proportions
    constant post-2090, without accounting for climate-induced migration.
  5: The analysis considers differential vulnerability based on low income, ethnicity/race,
    educational attainment, and age; Reactive, reasonably anticipated, and no additional
    adaptation strategies are used.
  6: A correction is made to account for the relationship between sectoral damages
    and GDP per capita.
  9: Climate change may broaden existing societal inequalities. Black or African Americans
    are more likely to be affected by additional premature mortality from climate-driven
    changes in air quality, while Hispanic or Latino Americans are more likely to
    experience lost labor hours.
  13: The FrEDI model incorporates information from the EPA's SV Report and considers
    four categories of differential vulnerability. The displayed figure shows RFF-SP
    scenario projections to 2300, providing context for long-term temperature and
    socioeconomic changes.
  14: The table includes different adaptation assumptions (no additional, reactive,
    proactive, reasonably anticipated, or with CO2 fertilization) for each sector.
    Some sectors have benefits rather than costs (e.g., Marine Fisheries).
  16: The study considers socially vulnerable groups (low income, elderly, BIPOC,
    those without a high school diploma).
  17: The default adaptation assumption in FrEDI is the reactive or reasonably anticipated
    adaptation option.
  18: Cromar et al. (2022) is used for temperature-related mortality throughout the
    analysis presented in the main text.
  19: The extension strategies vary by sector and impact subcategory, suggesting a
    tailored approach to projecting long-term climate impacts. The paper uses the
    FrEDI framework as a starting point.
  20: The figure caption and the graphs use different base years for dollar values
    (2020 and 2015, respectively). The uncertainty intervals, represented by shaded
    areas in the graphs, highlight the potential variability in future impacts.
