Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts (temperature changes, air pollution (O3 and PM2.5) exposure);
    Greenhouse gas emissions.
  2: Changes in mean surface temperature; Uncertainty in climate model parameters;
    Future emissions; Socioeconomic conditions; Structural uncertainty in select damage
    functions.
  3: Climate-driven damages under various economic and emissions scenarios, including
    impacts from changes in global mean surface temperature and sea-level rise on
    economic sectors in the US.
  4: CONUS (contiguous United States) temperature change relative to a 1986-2005 average,
    global mean sea level rise, US GDP, and regional population.
  5: Increased CO2, CH4, or N2O emissions; Climate-driven damages across impact sectors,
    geographic regions, and populations; Sea level rise.
  6: Climate-driven changes in temperature, air quality (O3 and PM2.5), Valley fever,
    Southwest dust, wildfire smoke exposure, and crime incidents.
  7: Climate-driven changes in temperature, air quality, high-tide flooding, wildfires,
    tropical storms, and other climate-related impacts.
  8: Climate change, specifically temperature increases, sea level rise, and related
    impacts on air quality, wildfire, dust, valley fever.
  9: Changes in temperature, high-tide flooding, climate-driven changes in air quality,
    wildfires.
  10: Climate change impacts, including temperature-related mortality, wildfire, road
    damage, rail damage, labor impacts, agriculture impacts, high tide flooding, wind
    damage, transportation impacts and air quality.
  11: Temperature change relative to a baseline, climate-driven changes in air quality.
  12: Climate change impacts, such as temperature-related mortality and sea level
    rise, driven by greenhouse gas emissions.
  13: Temperature change.
  14: Changes in climate factors such as temperatures, flooding, hurricane winds,
    and air quality have impacts on multiple sectors such as agriculture, health,
    and infrastructure.
  15: The primary drivers of risk are temperature increases and sea level rise, influencing
    various sectors differently. Discontinuities can arise from threshold effects,
    like sea levels breaching 100cm impacting coastal properties, or temperature bin
    boundaries impacting agriculture and wind damage. Sector-specific scalars such
    as per capita income-dependent VSL also influence damage estimates.
  17: Climate change impacts on various sectors like electricity transmission and
    distribution, rail, roads, coastal properties, and transportation due to high-tide
    flooding.
  20: Climate change, manifesting in rising temperatures, changes in air quality,
    increased frequency and intensity of wildfires, sea-level rise, changes in precipitation
    patterns (leading to flooding and drought), and altered weather patterns.
  21: Sea-level rise is identified as a determinant of future damages from CO2 emissions.
Highlights:
  1: Net national damages increase overtime; The majority of annual long-term damages
    are associated with climate change impacts to human health (mortality); Regional
    damages vary geographically; The Southeast is projected to experience the largest
    annual damages per capita; Climate change impacts may broaden existing societal
    inequalities (e.g., disproportionate effect on Black or African Americans from
    air quality changes).
  2: FrEDI can provide policy-relevant information and complement the types of analyses
    and outputs provided by existing integrated assessment models; Provides a traceable
    estimate of the economic damages within US borders from a marginal change in greenhouse
    gas emissions.
  4: FrEDI is designed to fill the need of monetizing a broad range of climate-driven
    impacts in the US across various warming, emission, and socioeconomic trajectories.
  5: FrEDI can compare climate-driven damages across different populations within
    the US based on social vulnerability; Adaptation has the capacity to both exacerbate
    and ameliorate future climate-driven damages, with the latter being more common.
  6: Climate-driven damages are largest in the health category, predominantly due
    to premature mortality linked to temperature and air quality changes.
  7: Health-related damages are projected to be the largest component of climate-driven
    damages, primarily driven by premature mortality attributable to temperature changes.
    National total damages in 2090 are primarily driven by the valuation of premature
    mortality attributable to climate-driven changes in temperature.
  8: Climate-driven damages vary significantly across sectors and geographical regions.
    Adaptation strategies can substantially reduce damages, particularly in the coastal
    property sector. Temperature-related mortality is the largest impact sector but
    does not include assumptions about future adaptation. The Southeast region is
    projected to experience the largest per capita damages.
  9: The largest monetary damages in 2090 are expected from premature mortality associated
    with changes in temperature. Negative impacts of climate change outweigh the positives
    such that net losses are projected in each region.
  10: Even considering only the direct CONUS impacts as estimated by FrEDI, damages
    per tonne of CO2 are almost 20% of a recently estimated global value (USD185 per
    tonne of CO2 under a 2% Ramsey discount)
  11: There is a wide range of potential damage estimates depending on the climate
    scenario, and significant disparities in the impacts of air quality on different
    racial and socioeconomic groups.
  12: The largest sectoral impact on monetized damages is premature mortality due
    to temperature changes.
  13: FrEDI can investigate adaptation options in select sectors.
  14: Key sectors affected include health, with significant mortality cost from temperature
    changes (mean USD2300 billion); electricity sector costs (mean USD11 billion);
    and tropical storm wind damage (mean USD28 billion).
  15: Total damages from climate change are projected to increase significantly across
    various sectors, with coastal properties experiencing a sharp increase in damages
    after 2080 due to sea levels breaching 100cm. Temperature related mortality, air
    quality, wildfire, coastal properties, and agriculture are strongly impacted,
    as is the energy sector.
  17: Proactive adaptation significantly reduces damages across all sectors compared
    to no adaptation or reactive adaptation.
  20: The analysis projects increasing economic damages across a wide range of sectors
    due to climate change between 2010 and 2090. Sectors such as wildfire, inland
    flooding, and temperature-related mortality show significant upward trends in
    damages.
  21: The economic burden of CO2 emissions varies significantly depending on the discount
    rate applied, with a higher discount rate leading to lower perceived damages;
    for instance, a 3% constant discount rate yields a median cost of $15 while a
    1.5% Ramsey discount rate results in a median cost of $51.
Methodology:
  1: Utilizes the reduced-complexity model, the Framework for Evaluating Damages and
    Impacts (FrEDI), to project economic and physical impacts across 10000 future
    scenarios; Projections are extended through 2300 to estimate the net present climate-driven
    damages.
  2: Uses the Framework for Evaluating Damages and Impacts (FrEDI), which draws upon
    information from detailed sectoral impact studies to rapidly assess US economic
    and physical impacts of climate change. Utilizes 10000 paired probabilistic emissions
    and socioeconomic projections with temperature projections from a simple climate
    model. Assesses impacts across 20 sectors within US borders through the end of
    the 21st century and extends to the year 2300 for net present damage calculations.
  3: The analysis uses the FaIR climate model to simulate impacts from greenhouse
    gas emissions on global mean surface temperature and then assesses damages using
    the FrEDI model based on socioeconomic projections from the RFF-SPs.
  4: Uses the FrEDI model which incorporates sectoral analyses from the CIRA project,
    Climate Impact Lab, and the American Thoracic Society to monetize climate-driven
    impacts in the US across various warming, emission, and socioeconomic trajectories.
    It calculates damages based on functions of CONUS temperature or sea level rise,
    US GDP, and regional population. A simple climate model FaIR is used to get the
    global mean surface temperature.  The FrEDI model contains a module to quantify
    impacts to socially vulnerable populations. The analysis disaggregates national
    populations to regional populations and uses projections from the RFF-SPs at the
    country level. Sub-national differences in warming are explored using results
    derived from a consistent set of GCMs used within the underlying studies.
  5: Extends FrEDI by linearly extrapolating its sector-specific, temperature-binned
    damage functions to account for the full range of temperature scenarios derived
    from the RFF-SP emission scenarios run through FaIR; Uses a baseline (emissions=RFF-SP
    emissions) and a perturbed case, where 1GtC pulse of CO2 (or CH4 or N2O) is added
    to each of the RFF-SP emissions scenarios in the year 2020; Discounting is applied
    using a 3% social rate of time preference, calibrated to the real rate of return
    for 10-year Treasury notes from 1973 through 2003.
  6: The analysis uses Ramsey discounting to calculate the net present value of climate
    damages, based on time-varying and state-specific discount rates.
  7: The analysis uses 10,000 RFF-SP (Resources for the Future - Shared Policy assumptions)
    emission, GDP, and population scenarios to project climate-driven damages. The
    results are applicable to projections of future climate impacts in the US.
  8: The study uses the FrEDI (Framework for Risk and Economic Damage from Inundation)
    framework to assess climate-driven damages across sectors. The results are applicable
    to the year 2090.
  9: The analysis projects damages across 10,000 RFF-SP scenarios, incorporating climate
    parameter uncertainty using a Monte Carlo approach and FaIR. The presented confidence
    intervals account for uncertainty in future emission and socioeconomic projections
    across the 10000 RFF-SP scenarios and climate parameter uncertainty.
  10: FrEDI model is extended to project climate damages through 2300 to quantify
    the net present damages within the US resulting from an additional tonne of CO2,
    CH4, or N2O emissions, using Ramsey discounting.
  11: Uses FrEDI (Framework for Risk and Economic Damages from Inherent Disasters).
    Compares damages across different SSP (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway) scenarios
    in 2090.
  12: The analysis quantifies future damages using the FrEDI framework, which includes
    various sectoral impacts within the contiguous US and considers adaptation opportunities.
  13: FrEDI allows for updates as new sectoral impact studies become available; it
    maintains adaptation assumptions from underlying studies.
  15: The analysis utilizes binned damage functions and sector-specific scalars (e.g.,
    per capita income-dependent VSL) to project damages based on underlying temperature
    or sea level rise scenarios. The results are applicable through 2100, given the
    specified temperature and sea level rise scenarios used to derive the binned damage
    functions.
  17: The FrEDI model is used to estimate impacts. Damage estimates for temperatures
    and sea level rise (SLR) exceeding the bounds of the original model (0-6 degrees
    Celsius and 30-250 cm GMSL rise by 2100) are extrapolated based on damage per
    degree or centimeter.
  20: The analysis projects climate impacts across multiple sectors using 10,000 projections,
    with results shown as mean and median damages alongside 95% confidence intervals.
  21: The Framework for Evaluating Damages and Impacts (FrEDI) model runs through
    2300 to calculate damages, with comparison between Ramsey and constant discount
    rates at various percentages.
More Notes:
  1: The analysis provides a detailed illustration of the distribution of climate
    change impacts within US borders.
  2: The analysis focuses on the contiguous United States (CONUS).
  4: CONUS temperature is estimated as 1.42 times the global temperature.
  5: "FrEDI adaptation assumptions include \u201Creactive\u201D, \u201Creasonably\
    \ anticipated adaptation\u201D, or \u201Cno additional adaptation\u201D for each\
    \ sector."
  7: The sectoral damages are sensitive to assumptions in the adaptation scenarios.
    Only a subset of potential climate impacts to the US are represented in the FrEDI
    model.
  8: The study acknowledges potential double-counting between temperature-related
    mortality and air quality impacts. It also notes the potential for compounding
    effects (e.g., power outages exacerbating temperature-related mortality) that
    are not fully accounted for in the analysis. The sectors assessed are independent
    and therefore damages are additive across these sectors.
  9: FrEDI (Framework for Risk and Economic Assessment of Disasters) is used to generate
    results. The analysis considers disproportionate exposure and distributional physical
    effects across four groups of potentially socially vulnerable populations for
    six sectors.
  10: Regional per capita damages vary significantly across the US, with the Southeast
    experiencing the highest damages ($9300 per capita) and the Northern Plains the
    lowest ($3900 per capita) under the base scenario.
  11: The damage estimates are constrained to the 48 contiguous US states, and a global
    analysis would be more appropriate for evaluating climate policies. Also estimates
    the net present value of future damages from additional tonnes of CH4 and N2O.
  12: FrEDI framework is continuously evolving to include a broader range of sectors
    but still lacks coverage of some non-market sectors and interactions among sectors.
  13: FrEDI incorporates reactive adaptation scenarios by default, but allows for
    proactive adaptation scenarios as well.
  15: Slight discontinuities in some sectors (e.g., agriculture) occur either at the
    boundary between temperature bins (e.g., for agriculture and wind damage) or due
    to thresholds in the underlying studies.
  17: The default adaptation assumption in FrEDI is reactive or reasonably anticipated
    adaptation.
