Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, specifically changes in temperature and precipitation, and the
    sensitivity of crops to these changes.
  3: Changes in growing season average temperature and precipitation.
  4: Temperature and precipitation changes affecting crop yields.
  5: Temperature changes, rainfall changes
  7: Uncertainties in average growing season temperature changes and crop responses
    to these changes are a greater source of uncertainty than changes in precipitation;
    impacts of extreme events, pests and diseases, changes in solar radiation
Highlights:
  1: Uncertainties related to temperature represented a greater contribution to climate
    change impact uncertainty than those related to precipitation for most crops and
    regions. The sensitivity of crop yields to temperature was a critical source of
    uncertainty. Progress in understanding crop responses to temperature and the magnitude
    of regional temperature changes are two of the most important needs for climate
    change impact assessments and adaptation efforts for agriculture.
  3: Temperature changes appear to dominate the impact on crop production, even in
    rainfed systems. The uncertainty surrounding temperature projections is large
    relative to historical variability. Precipitation changes are less influential
    because models disagree on the sign of change, and the magnitude of change is
    small relative to historical variability.
  4: Models with higher R-squared values tend to have greater sensitivity to precipitation.
  5: "Temperature terms generally contribute most to the total uncertainty in crop\
    \ yield impacts. The relative importance of temperature impacts is sensitive to\
    \ the value of E[\u03B2P]. Precipitation uncertainties become more important for\
    \ high values of E[\u03B2P] coupled with low values of E[\u03B2T] and Var(\u03B2\
    T), and high values of Var(/Delta1P)."
  7: Uncertainties in temperature changes and crop responses are a greater source
    of uncertainty for future impacts than changes in precipitation; crop model inter-comparison
    projects may be useful in the short run; warming trials for major crops may be
    a useful means of prioritizing and focusing adaptation efforts
Methodology:
  1: "Evaluation of uncertainties in projections of climate change impacts on crop\
    \ production for 94 crop\u2013region combinations. Sensitivity analysis focusing\
    \ on the relative contributions of climate model projections of temperature and\
    \ precipitation, and crop sensitivities to temperature and precipitation changes."
  3: The analysis uses climate models (GCMs) to project temperature and precipitation
    changes and relates these to crop production based on historical variability.
    The analysis uses output from 20 GCMs.
  4: Statistical modeling of crop production based on historical climate data; regression
    analysis to assess the impact of temperature and precipitation; sensitivity analysis
    to evaluate the robustness of the results.
  5: Regression analysis (equation 2) using 94 crop-region combinations, sensitivity
    analysis varying parameters related to temperature and precipitation.
  7: Analysis relies on time series models rather than process-based models or cross-sectional
    data, considers uncertainties related to growing season average temperature and
    precipitation
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the bulk of calories consumed by malnourished populations.
  3: The inter-model standard deviation of GCM projections is used as a representation
    of climate uncertainty, although this is a debated assumption, particularly for
    precipitation.
  4: The analysis focuses on crop-region combinations and examines the impact of rainfall
    and temperature on crop production, considering intra-seasonal rainfall distribution
    and temperature-rainfall interactions.
  5: The analysis considers interactions between temperature and precipitation changes
    and their impact on crop yields.
  7: The authors believe that the impacts of extreme events, pests and diseases, changes
    in solar radiation, and many other factors are likely to be captured by or secondary
    to those of average temperature change, but further work is needed to test this
    point; adaptive management changes represent an additional but poorly known source
    of uncertainty in future impacts.

    consumed by malnourished populations.

  4: Crop production and its sensitivity to climate variables.

  7: Agricultural production/crop yields, and impacts on risk assessment of climate
    change
Quantitative material:

    and precipitation, the contribution of variance components to climate change impact
    projections for 2030, and the mean and standard deviation of projections for temperature
    and precipitation changes by 2030.
  4: R-squared values of statistical crop models; percentage change in crop production
    for each percentage change in precipitation; fraction of total variance attributed
    to temperature related factors.

    \ yield sensitivity to precipitation (\u03B2P, % per %), uncertainty in temperature\
    \ change (/Delta1T, \xB0C), uncertainty in precipitation change (/Delta1P, %)."
  7: "Fraction of total variance in climate change impact projections for 2030 remaining\
    \ if the estimated value of \u03C3(\u03B2 T ) is replaced by the lowest observed\
    \ value across all crops (0.7% per \u25E6C)"
