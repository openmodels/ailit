Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, expansion of the wildland-urban interface, and questionable wildfire
    management practices emphasizing fire suppression contribute to increased wildfire
    risk.
  2: Modeled wildland fire-associated PM2.5 concentrations
  3: Wildfires, specifically PM2.5 concentrations from wildfires.
  6: Wildland fires impacting air quality through PM2.5 exposure.
  9: Wildland fire PM2.5 exposure.
Highlights:
  1: Wildfires account for a greater mortality and economic burden than indicated
    by earlier studies.
  2: fire-only PM2.5 contributes between 6.9 and 49% of PM2.5 from all sources, depending
    on the severity of the fires in each particular year. In 2008, 2017, and 2018,
    years where California fires burned between 1.5 million and nearly 2 million acres
    (35), fire-only PM2.5 was responsible for almost half of all sources PM2.5.
  3: Wildfire smoke increases PM2.5 exposure, leading to mortality impacts. Mortality
    estimates vary significantly by year, corresponding with wildfire activity. Mortality
    estimates using a wildfire-specific dose-response are ~35% higher than using an
    undifferentiated dose-response.
  6: Use of a chronic wildfire-specific dose-response value increases the magnitude
    of mortality findings compared to undifferentiated responses.
  9: Wildland fire PM2.5 exposures in California from 2008-2018 are estimated to cause
    between 52,480 and 55,710 premature deaths, resulting in an economic valuation
    of $432 billion to $456 billion.
Methodology:
  1: "Uses Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system wildland fire PM2.5 estimates,\
    \ a concentration-response function for PM2.5, ZIP code\u2013level mortality data,\
    \ and an estimated wildfire-specific dose-response coefficient."
  2: use modeled wildland fire-associated PM2.5 concentrations, high-resolution California
    Department of Public Health (CDPH) mortality data, and a calculated chronic dose-response
    coefficient for wildfire PM2.5 exposures and mortality to estimate premature deaths
    due to wildland fires over an 11-year period from 2008 to 2018.
  3: "CMAQ model used to simulate PM2.5 concentrations. Two exposure scenarios: base\
    \ case (all data) and modified cap (99.9th percentile capped). Chronic wildfire-specific\
    \ dose-response value (\u03B2WL) and undifferentiated PM2.5 dose-response value\
    \ (\u03B2L) used for mortality estimation."
  6: The analysis uses a wildfire-specific dose-response value, ZIP code-level health
    data, and extends over 11 years of data for improved temporal and spatial specificity.
  9: Health impact analysis applying CTM estimates of wildland fire PM2.5 to estimate
    mortality outcomes using high-resolution health data over an 11-year period (2008-2018).
    Chronic dose-response value is applied for wildfire-specific PM2.5 exposure.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic impact of premature deaths due to wildfire PM2.5 in California is estimated
    at $432 to $456 billion over 11 years (2008-2018).
  2: No relevant information
  3: Mortality burden due to wildfire PM2.5 exposure in California
  9: Economic valuation of premature deaths attributable to fire-only PM2.5 exposures.
Quantitative material:
  1: 52,480 to 55,710 premature deaths attributable to wildland fire PM2.5 over 11
    years (2008-2018), equating to an economic impact of $432 to $456 billion.
  2: Table 1 presents a summary of the modeled PM2.5 estimates, which includes concentrations
    from the entire state, including rural areas with minimal background pollution.
  3: 'Annual mortality impacts due to fire-only PM2.5 exposure range from ~1240 deaths
    (95% CI: 110 to 2370) in 2010 to 12,850 (95% CI: 1150 to 23,730) in 2018, totaling
    ~55,710 (95% CI: 4960 to 103,410) over the 11-year period (base case).'
  6: Estimates of premature deaths in California due to wildfire PM2.5 exposure are
    between 12,150 to 12,850 for 2018.
  9: Estimates between 52,480 and 55,710 premature deaths attributable to fire-only
    PM2.5 exposures, with an associated economic valuation of $432 billion to $456
    billion.
