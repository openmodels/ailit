  12: Wildfire smoke, PM2.5
  13: Wildfires and air pollution (PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide, ozone) are identified
    as key drivers of risk.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Mortality attributable to PM2.5 from wildland fires in California from 2008 to
    2018.
  2: This paper focuses on the mortality impacts of wildland fire-associated PM2.5
    concentrations in California.
  3: Mortality and economic valuation impacts of wildland fires
  4: Estimates total deaths attributable to fire-only PM2.5 for adults ages 25+ in
    California.
  5: The paper evaluates the mortality impacts of PM2.5 exposure attributable to wildland
    fires in California from 2008 to 2018.
  6: Economic valuation of mortality impacts from wildland fires.
  7: The paper evaluates the health impacts of wildfire smoke exposure, specifically
    mortality impacts in California.
  8: Long-term mortality risk and health impacts are being evaluated.
  9: This study evaluates the harmful impacts of PM2.5 from wildland fire smoke on
    the health of the California population during the 11-year period of 2008 to 2018,
    specifically focusing on mortality.
  11: This paper evaluates the mortality burden and economic valuation of health burden
    from exposure to PM2.5 due to wildland fire smoke in California.
  12: Wildfire smoke impacts
  13: This study seems to evaluate health impacts, particularly related to air pollution
    and wildfire smoke exposure, potentially looking at mortality and morbidity.
Highlights:
  1: The study suggests wildfires account for a greater mortality and economic burden
    than indicated by earlier studies.
  2: The study estimates premature deaths due to wildland fires in California over
    an 11-year period.
  3: Wildfire smoke expands geographic areas affected by higher PM2.5. Mortality impacts
    vary greatly by year, with highest mortality in 2018, the year with the highest
    number of wildfire acres burned.
  4: Mortality impacts from wildland fire smoke are substantial; higher attributable
    deaths occurred in later years (2017, 2018) because fires and smoke exposure expanded
    to more high population areas; elevated number of fires in 2008, 2017 and 2018
    contributed to large increases in mortality impacts.
  5: Wildfire-related PM2.5 accounted for nearly 19% of total deaths attributable
    to all sources of PM2.5 in California during the study period.
  6: Capping fire-only PM2.5 concentrations at a high percentile still results in
    substantial impacts.
  7: The study provides the first estimate of chronic wildfire-specific mortality
    impacts through the use of a fire-specific dose-response coefficient.
  8: Wildfire PM2.5 may have heightened toxicity compared to undifferentiated PM2.5,
    potentially underestimating health burdens if only acute estimates from undifferentiated
    PM2.5 are used. Epidemiological analyses suggest wildfire smoke is up to 10 times
    more harmful to human health than PM from other sources.
  9: The study finds substantial health and associated economic impacts from wildfires,
    emphasizing the importance of cultivating community resilience and protecting
    vulnerable populations.
  11: The paper estimates the mortality burden and economic valuation of the health
    burden due to wildland fires. It also compares mortality calculations using wildfire-specific
    PM2.5 dose-response values to those using undifferentiated PM2.5 dose-response
    values.
  12: Wildfire smoke impacts respiratory health more than fine particles from other
    sources
  13: The paper likely focuses on estimating PM2.5 concentrations, community vulnerability
    to wildfire smoke, and health impacts of air pollution.
Methodology:
  1: Quantified mortality burden using Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system
    and ZIP code-level mortality data, applying a wildfire-specific dose-response
    coefficient for PM2.5.
  2: The study uses modeled wildland fire-associated PM2.5 concentrations, California
    Department of Public Health (CDPH) mortality data, and a calculated chronic dose-response
    coefficient for wildfire PM2.5 exposures to estimate premature deaths due to wildland
    fires over an 11-year period (2008-2018).
  3: 'CMAQ model used to estimate fire-only PM2.5 concentrations at a 12-km resolution
    for 2008 to 2018. Mortality is estimated using two exposure scenarios: a base
    case and a modified cap scenario, using a calculated chronic wildfire-specific
    dose-response value.'
  4: Estimated mortality impacts using both wildfire-specific and undifferentiated
    chronic dose-response values for 2008-2018; modeled PM2.5 concentrations are sometimes
    capped at the 99.9th percentile; compared mortality attributable to all sources
    PM2.5 with that attributable to fire-only PM2.5; used different short-term dose-response
    values to estimate mortality.
  5: Modeled wildland fire PM2.5 estimates at a 12-km grid scale, used chronic dose-response
    value for wildfire exposure, and highly resolved health data with the CMAQ model.
  6: The study uses a wildfire-specific dose-response value and considers uncertainties
    in modeled PM2.5 estimates by using a 'mod cap' scenario (modeled values capped).
  7: The analysis uses 11 years of CMAQ model data to estimate fire-only PM2.5 impacts
    and utilizes a fire-specific dose-response coefficient.
  8: Uses a CTM (Chemical Transport Model) for exposure assignment to separate annual
    wildfire PM2.5 concentrations from other sources. Existing estimates of long-term
    exposure to undifferentiated PM2.5 are modified with adjustment for potentially
    different dose-response functions of wildfires.
  9: "The analysis applies CTM estimates of wildland fire PM2.5 to estimate mortality\
    \ outcomes using high-resolution health data, considering a chronic dose-response\
    \ value for wildfire-specific PM2.5 exposure over an 11-year period. They used\
    \ U.S. EPA\u2019s CMAQ (version 5.0.1 to 5.3) modeling system for daily modeled\
    \ PM2.5 concentrations for 2008 to 2018 for the state of California at a 12-km\
    \ grid spatial resolution."
  11: "The mortality burden is calculated using Eq. 3, which takes into account a\
    \ dose-response value (\u03B2WL), the change in PM2.5 concentration from wildland\
    \ fire smoke, and the total deaths in adults ages 25 and up. The economic valuation\
    \ is calculated using Eq. 4, which multiplies the mortality burden by the VSL,\
    \ accounting for income growth to the year 2015. Monte Carlo distribution is used\
    \ to estimate the final dose-response value."
  12: Observational evidence from Southern California
  13: The paper utilizes ensemble-based models, deep learning, systematic reviews,
    and meta-analyses. The spatial scope is relevant to California and the contiguous
    United States.
More Notes:
  2: The study uses high-resolution California Department of Public Health (CDPH)
    mortality data and a chronic dose-response coefficient specifically for wildfire
    PM2.5. The modeled PM2.5 concentrations are at a 12-km grid scale. The analysis
    includes both rural and urban areas in California.
  3: The study compares mortality estimates using a wildfire-specific dose-response
    value to an undifferentiated PM2.5 dose-response value, finding that the wildfire-specific
    value results in approximately 35% higher mortality estimates.
  4: Mortality impacts are more widespread throughout population centers due to smoke
    transport; the paper references supplemental analyses and figures in the supplementary
    materials (S5, S6, etc.); Results are specific to California and the period from
    2008-2018.
  6: The difference between the base case and mod cap scenarios is small in lower
    fire years (2009-2014), indicating higher concentrations primarily occur during
    severe fire events.
  11: The authors replicated mortality calculations using the chronic undifferentiated
    PM2.5 dose-response value from a U.S. national study to compare against using
    wildfire-specific dose-response values. They also performed supplemental mortality
    analyses using alternative short-term wildfire PM2.5 dose-response values.
  13: The paper acknowledges funding from the California Air Resources Board, NASA,
    DOE, and UCLA, suggesting a focus on research relevant to California and US-wide
    climate impacts.
Quantitative material:
  1: Estimated 52,480 to 55,710 premature deaths attributable to wildland fire PM2.5
    over the 11-year period, with an economic impact of $432 to $456 billion.
  2: Fire-only PM2.5 contributes between 6.9% and 49% of total PM2.5 in California,
    depending on the year. In 2008, 2017, and 2018, fire-only PM2.5 was responsible
    for almost half of all sources PM2.5.
  3: 'Annual mortality impacts due to fire-only PM2.5 exposure range from a low of
    ~1240 deaths (95% CI: 110 to 2370) in 2010 to a high of 12,850 (95% CI: 1150 to
    23,730) in 2018. Total of ~55,710 (95% CI: 4960 to 103,410) deaths for the base
    case over the 11-year period.'
  4: Mortality impacts from wildland fire smoke are substantial; premature deaths
    attributable to all sources PM2.5 are five times larger than the mortality impacts
    from solely wildland fire impacts; Wildland fires are responsible for ~19% of
    PM2.5-associated deaths overall and up to 42% in high-fire years; 103,930 total
    deaths estimated using global dose-response values versus 55,710 for their primary
    results, for the 11 year period; Total deaths of 108,920 and 76,920 attributable
    to fire-PM2.5 are estimated for the two lags respectively.
  5: Estimated 52,480 to 55,710 premature deaths attributable to fire-only PM2.5 in
    California from 2008 to 2018; economic valuation of $432 billion to $456 billion
    in 2015 dollars.
  6: "The scenario capping fire-only concentrations at the 99.9th percentile (exceeding\
    \ 143 \u03BCg/m3) results in several hundreds to thousands of fewer fire-only\
    \ PM2.5 attributed deaths per year."
  8: The study includes estimates of both adjusted (wildfire-specific chronic dose-response
    value) and unadjusted (undifferentiated chronic dose-response value) long-term
    mortality associated with fire-only PM2.5.
  9: The study estimates that between 52,480 and 55,710 premature deaths are attributable
    to fire-only PM2.5 exposures, with an associated economic valuation of $432 billion
    to $456 billion.
  11: The paper calculates a 95% CI for the estimated dose-response value. The EPA's
    value of a statistical life (VSL) of $8.7 million in 2015 dollars is used. A 3%
    discount rate is applied.
  12: No quantitative information
  13: The paper mentions ensemble-based modeling for PM2.5 estimation and deep learning
    for estimating PM2.5 over California. It also mentions a systematic review and
    meta-analysis of the association between air pollution and diabetes mellitus.
