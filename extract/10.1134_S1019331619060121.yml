Drivers of Risk:
  1: Permafrost thawing and degradation due to global climate change, specifically
    under the RCP8.5 scenario.
  2: Permafrost thawing and degradation due to climate change.
  3: Permafrost degradation effects impact on transportation infrastructure and therefore
    on the economy.
  5: Permafrost thawing and degradation affecting road infrastructure
  6: Permafrost degradation due to climate warming impacts the sustainability of road
    infrastructure in the Russian North.
  8: Thawing and degradation of permafrost due to climate change.
Highlights:
  1: The maximum costs will be relevant for the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Magadan
    oblast, and the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. The implementation of the modernization
    scenario will require revision of existing standards, technologies, and the entire
    economy of the road infrastructure and capital construction.
  2: Permafrost degradation causes significant economic damage, particularly affecting
    infrastructure and leading to substantial expenditures on maintenance and repairs.
  3: Transportation system, especially motor transport, is crucial for the economy
    of regions in the Russian North, contributing about 7% to GRP and serving 69%
    of regional freight traffic. The state of road infrastructure varies significantly
    across regions.
  5: The paper examines the impact of permafrost degradation on road infrastructure
    in Russia and presents three scenarios (Conservative, Moderate, and Modernization)
    for road infrastructure development and the associated costs and benefits.
  6: Significant risk of expected damage to road infrastructure from permafrost thawing
    and degradation over the next 30 years.
  8: The risks of disturbing and destroying the sustainability of the road infrastructure
    under permafrost thawing and degradation are very high, even under the conservative
    scenario.
Methodology:
  1: Three model scenarios (inertial/conservative, moderate, and modernization) are
    used to assess changes in road infrastructure sustainability in nine Russian Arctic
    regions until mid-century (2020-2050). The assessment is based on six model climate
    assessments of cryogenic conditions reflecting the RCP8.5 scenario and Russia's
    Transport Strategy until 2035.
  2: The article attempts to give an economic assessment of the sustainability of
    road infrastructure under various climate change scenarios in the aftermath of
    permafrost thawing and degradation.
  5: "The assessment involves modeling the expected damage from permafrost thawing\
    \ on road infrastructure, along with maintenance and modernization costs until\
    \ 2060 under various climate change scenarios. The methodology uses criteria from\
    \ the International Permafrost Association to estimate the length of roads built\
    \ on permafrost and Russian Mintrans data to estimate construction, reconstruction,\
    \ and capital repair costs. Road infrastructure development scenarios are based\
    \ on Russia\u2019s Transport Strategy until 2030."
  6: The analysis uses climate change models such as RCP8.5 to assess risks from permafrost
    degradation, with specific calculations for soil subsidence based on thaw rates
    and ice content.
  8: The calculations are based on a methodology of assessing the effects of permafrost
    thawing and degradation under climate change on the sustainability of the road
    infrastructure in the Russian Arctic.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the economic consequences of permafrost degradation on road
    infrastructure, a specific sector, rather than a broad macroeconomic or fiscal
    analysis. The study area is limited to the Russian Arctic.
  2: 'The study focuses on nine regions in the Russian North most affected by permafrost
    degradation: the Komi Republic; Yakutia; the Nenets, Yamalo-Nenets, Khanty-Mansi,
    and Chukotka AOs; Krasnoyarsk krai; Magadan oblast; and Kamchatka krai.'
  3: The focus is on the Russian North, where the extractive industry dominates. The
    paper links permafrost degradation to transportation infrastructure and, thus,
    the regional economy. The data presented is from 2017 and 2018.
  5: The paper uses a previously tested methodology based on criteria of the International
    Permafrost Association to assess the length of roads and/or the number of engineering
    facilities of the road infrastr ucture located on permafrost
  8: 'The paper considers three scenarios: conservative, moderate, and modernization,
    with different levels of road reconstruction and construction.'
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic assessment of maintaining road infrastructure sustainability and reducing
    damage risks under permafrost thawing and degradation in the Russian Arctic.
  2: GDP effects are mentioned as a consequence of permafrost degradation.
  3: Impact of transportation system on Gross Regional Product (GRP).
  5: No relevant information
  8: Costs of reconstruction and maintenance of regional road infrastructure due to
    thawing and permafrost degradation.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Capital costs to maintain road infrastructure sustainability under permafrost\
    \ thawing and degradation will average at least \u20BD14 bln a year under a conservative\
    \ scenario, exceeding \u20BD21 bln and \u20BD28 bln under moderate and modernization\
    \ scenarios, respectively."
  2: "Average annual perennial damage caused by permafrost degradation is about \u20BD\
    150 bln, or 0.16% of GDP. Up to \u20BD55 bln are spent annually to maintain pipeline\
    \ working capacity and eliminate mechanical deformations related to permafrost\
    \ soil disturbance."
  3: "Cargo transportation volume by region in 2017 (Table 1, in million tons, by\
    \ motor, rail, and inland waterway); Length of surfaced roads in regions of the\
    \ Russian North in 2018 (Table 2, in km, total, hard-surface, improved hard-surface);\
    \ Extraction of raw materials and mineral resources is 44% of the total gross\
    \ regional product (GRP); Transportation contributes about 7% to the total gross\
    \ regional product; Construction cost of 1 km of new roads (per one traffic lane)\
    \ net of VAT is \u20BD11.73\u2013\u20BD52.28 mln; the motor road reconstruction\
    \ cost is \u20BD10.32\u2013\u20BD46.03 mln; the cost of roadbed capital repairs\
    \ is \u20BD9.71\u2013\u20BD20.62 mln."
  5: Table 4 presents scenarios of road infrastructure development in predominantly
    permafrost regions of the Russian North, including increased length of motor roads
    by 2030 (percentage change from 2018) and the share of hard asphalt motor roads
    in 2018 and 2030 for Conservative, Moderate, and Modernization scenarios.
  6: "Total cost of fixed assets in the regions was \u20BD34.72 trillion in 2018,\
    \ with transport assets costing about \u20BD10.29 trillion; \u20BD763.2 billion\
    \ is allocated to road infrastructure."
  8: "Expected direct damage to road infrastructure sustainability in the nine Arctic\
    \ regions will amount to at least \u20BD14 bln, or 0.14% of the total GRP cost\
    \ of these regions in 2018."
