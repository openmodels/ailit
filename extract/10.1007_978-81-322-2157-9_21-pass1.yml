    \ years in every 10-year period."
  21: Increasing temperatures hasten crop maturity, reduce yields, and increase crop
    water requirements; Central and eastern zones are particularly vulnerable due
    to declining rainfall and increasing temperatures.
  22: ICAR is focusing on evolving cost-effective adaptation strategies.
  23: The need for evolving crop varieties with better tolerance to abiotic stresses
    and improved use efficiency under changing climate conditions.

    food security, nutritional security, food security sustainability, risk coverage,
    employment opportunity, etc.
  42: Significant regime shifts in rainfall in Orissa and a structural change in the
    frequency of depressions in the Bay of Bengal were observed during the 20th century.
  44: Orissa experienced 99 extreme events (floods, droughts, cyclones) between 1901
    and 2000. The rainfall distribution experienced three significant regime shifts.
    The decade-wise maximum, minimum, and average rainfall amounts follow a decreasing
    trend, while the standard deviations of rainfall follow an increasing trend.
  45: Annual rainfall in Orissa experienced three significant breaks in the last century,
    with decreasing average rainfall and increasing standard deviation over time.
    Cyclonic disturbances (depression) frequency decreased from 1949 onwards.
  49: Years with less than average annual rainfall identified as drought years attributed
    to significant rainfall variations.
  55: Rainfall distribution during the soybean growing season is more important than
    the total amount for soybean yield; Climate change-driven rainfall variability
    significantly impacts soybean yield, with potential for substantial reductions
    under specific drought conditions.
  56: Rising temperatures are projected to decrease soybean yield in central India,
    but delaying sowing dates could mitigate these negative impacts and increase yields.
  57: There was a sharp decline in average yield after the 10th of July sowing date.
    There was interannual variation in soybean yield due to rainfall.
  58: Increased temperature significantly decreases soybean yield, and adaptation
    strategies like adjusting sowing dates can mitigate some of the yield loss.
  59: Increasing plant density from 50 to 60 plants/m2 can mitigate the adverse impact
    of climate change on soybean yield. Advanced sowing dates, up to the 10th of July,
    and increased plant population can reduce the impact of climate change on crop
    yield.
  63: The analysis highlights that temperature increases during critical growth phases
    like anthesis and grain-filling can reduce wheat yields.
  69: Late sowing decreases wheat yield due to temperature increases during grain
    filling stage in some locations (Hisar, Ludhiana) but increases yields in other
    locations (Pantnagar due to grain number increase and East India generally).
  70: Warmer temperatures in March 2009-2010 impacted wheat yield. Late sowing led
    to yield reductions, particularly in Uttar Pradesh. Yields vary significantly
    by region (Northwest India, Uttar Pradesh, East India) and sowing conditions.
  88: The paper models weather parameters using stochastic methods, including autocorrelation
    and partial autocorrelation analysis, and ARIMA modeling to forecast temperature.
  89: The study explores the relationship between climate variables (temperature,

    area at lower elevations (1,600-2,000 m); Potential to improve the niche model
    by using sub-modules for dominant varieties and 'high productive' orchard locations
    as input.
  109: Rubber dams helped in providing irrigation in the critical stage of paddy,
    increasing rice productivity by 62%.

    periods are more prone to uncertainty; Frequent drought and flood occurrence in
    the Mahanadi delta.
  115: July rainfall, critical for monsoon crops, significantly decreased during the
    global warming era (1971 onwards). Monsoon rainfall indicates most drought years
    of the last century occurred from 1971 onwards. Recent increase in post-monsoon
    rainfall contributes to annual rainfall increases. Increased run-off in 1990-2004
    compared to 1972-1989, but with increased variability suggesting more uncertainty
    in wet periods.
  119: Drought in October-December 2011 affected paddy yield adversely; uneven rainfall

    India mainly depend on climate variables.
  164: India's vulnerability to climate change impacts on agriculture, particularly
    wheat and rice production.
  168: Quantile regression allows for differential impacts of weather covariates on
    distinct quantiles of yield, unlike mean regression which assumes parallel quantiles.
    Mean regression may understate the true magnitude of climate change impacts if
    climate change leads to increased variance in rainfall.
  171: There appears to be an inverted U-shape relationship between yield and temperature,
    indicating that temperature up to a certain point is beneficial and harmful thereafter.
    The difference across quantiles of yield of the inflection point is minimal, indicating
    a significant degree of uniformity across differing crops and ecology types.
  172: The tables provide quantitative estimates of the impact of climate variables
    (temperature and rainfall) on wheat and rice yields across different regions of
    India. The study suggests regional variation in impacts under different climate

  180: Observed climate change in Northwest Himalayas includes increasing average
    temperature and decreasing annual rainfall.
  181: The Himalayan region is projected to experience changes in temperature and
    precipitation, leading to drought severity increases in some areas despite overall
    precipitation increases. Flood risks are projected to increase, potentially impacting
    infrastructure. Agriculture is affected by shifting cropping patterns and declines
    in productivity, particularly for apples and cash crops. Farmers are adapting
    by shifting to off-season vegetables and other crops.

  178: Higher mean, maximum and minimum temperatures during winter season resulted
    in poor wheat grain yield, whilst lower mean, maximum and minimum temperatures
    resulted in poor rice grain yield.
  179: "Agriculture contributes nearly 13.7% of GDP in India; Drought in 2002 resulted\
    \ in a loss of more than 10% in food production; Northwest Himalayas covers 33,139\
    \ ha, 53.66% forest area and 15.48% net area sown; Annual rainfall in NW Himalayas\
    \ is 350\u20133,000 mm per year."
  180: "Retreating trend of Gangotri glaciers of 26.5 m/year (1935\u20131971), 17.1\
    \ m/year (1971\u20132004), and 12.5 m/year (2004\u20132005)."
  181: Projected precipitation increase of 5-13% in the 2030s compared to the 1970s;
    decline in apple productivity of about 2-3% overall and up to 4% in marginal farms;
    marginal reduction of about 4% in total farm income; decline in productivity of
    cash crops like potato and peas by more than 11-15% over a decade; increase in
    water yield by 5-20% in most areas.
  182: Average maximum temperature of May increased by 1.58 /C14C
  186: Table 1 presents percentage reduction in grain yield for various crops (Wheat,
    Soybean, Lentil, Garden pea, Field pea) due to delayed sowing.
  190: Rajasthan shows a significant warming of 0.5 /C per 100 years, which is comparable
    to the global mean trend of 0.3 /C and all India mean of 0.4 /C per 100 years.
  191: "A rise of 0.6\xB0C in Rajasthan's temperature noted; blocks moving from safe\
    \ to dark zones in water availability but no specific quantitative economic outcomes."

    information is present on this page.
  223: Groundwater table is shallower for 75% of the days in 1998 compared to 2005
    in the Dhor-nani catchment. Overland water depth increased in 2005 compared to
    1998.
  231: Projected mean temperature and rainfall changes over the Indian subcontinent
    for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s under annual, Rabi, and Kharif seasons with lowest
    and highest values provided.
