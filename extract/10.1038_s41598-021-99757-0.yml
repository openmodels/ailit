Drivers of Risk:
  2: Changes impacting outcomes include variations in minimum mortality temperature
    (MMT), frequency (EXD), and magnitude (MAG) of heat exposure due to different
    RCP/SSP combinations.
  3: Uses RCP/SSP scenarios to project future climate conditions. The drivers of risk
    are elevated temperatures exceeding a threshold.
  5: Changes in climate variables are primary contributors to adaptations and risk
    outcomes, with the 30-year mean temperature being a significant factor.
  7: Changes in heat exposure frequency, specifically EXD (days exceeding a threshold
    of heat exposure) and MAG (magnitude of heat exposure), driven by different RCP/SSP
    scenarios (RCP2.6/SSP1 and RCP8.5/SSP5).
  8: Changes in future heat exposure magnitude
  9: Summer temperatures and socio-economic pathways.
  11: Daily mean temperature (tas), daily mean humidity (hurs), and daily mean wind
    speed (sfcWind) are used to derive apparent temperature, which drives mortality
    risk. Changes in these climate parameters between past and future periods (1965-1995
    vs. 2064-2094) are considered.
  12: The primary driver of risk is the exceedance of daily mean apparent temperature
    (ATmean) over the city-specific Maximum Monthly Temperature (MMT), a measure of
    heat adaptation. The study considers future climate projections under different
    RCP/SSP scenarios.

    from 2000 to 2100 under various climate and socio-economic scenarios.

    as well as absolute Mean Monthly Temperature (MMT) for 2100.
  7: Mortality
  8: Future adaptation and heat exposure for 3820 cities worldwide have been assessed
    jointly.
  9: The paper evaluates heat exposure in cities.
  11: Assesses the frequency of days with daily mean apparent temperature (ATmean)
    exceeding the minimum mortality temperature (MMT) and the magnitude of the exceedance.
  12: The study evaluates critical heat exposure in cities by comparing apparent temperature
    (ATmean) to a measure of human heat adaptation called the Maximum Monthly Temperature
    (MMT).

Highlights:
  2: The scenario RCP8.5/SSP5, characterized by high forcing levels and rapid unsustainable
    growth, results in high adaptive capacity and exposure until 2100, but exacerbates
    heat exposure frequency and magnitude.
  3: "Figure 1 shows distributions of the studied parameters (MMT, EXD, MAG) and their\
    \ changes for different RCP/SSP combinations, with vertical lines indicating the\
    \ distributions\u2019 medians."
  5: RCP8.5/SSP5 projects higher increments in delta1MMT compared to RCP2.6/SSP1,
    with climate effects dominating adaptation changes.
  7: Higher forcing (RCP8.5/SSP5) leads to more cities experiencing aggravated heat
    exposure changes. Lower forcing (RCP2.6/SSP1) leads to a larger reducing effect
    on heat exposure parameters for more cities. High increases in heat exposure also
    coincide with small adaptation (MMT) in some regions, potentially leading to increased
    mortality.
  8: The analysis identifies the 'least unfavourable choice for human health outcomes'
    considering that all options constitute an impairment. Significant differences
    in changes in exposure are shown between RCP2.6/SSP1 and RCP8.5/SSP5 scenarios.
  9: RCP2.6/SSP1 is more beneficial for urban populations' health than RCP8.5/SSP5.
  11: The re-calibrated model using gridded climate data preserves the relative importance
    of independent variables and results in only a minor penalty with a coarser climate
    data.

Methodology:
  2: The analysis uses combinations of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)
    and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to project changes in MMT, EXD, and MAG
    for urban populations until 2100.
  3: Uses RCP/SSP scenarios to project MMT, EXD, and MAG. Analysis covers the periods
    2090-2099, with baseline comparisons to 1991-2000 and 2000 for temperature changes.
    Provides distributions and medians for various RCP/SSP combinations.
  7: Analysis uses RCP2.6/SSP1 and RCP8.5/SSP5 scenarios to project changes in EXD
    and MAG until 2090-2099. The analysis considers 3820 cities. Adaptation and exposure
    parameters are aggregated across cities.
  8: "Analysis considers RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 and SSPs 1\u20135, projecting\
    \ changes until 2100. Compares exposure outcomes by indicator across 3820 world\
    \ cities between RCP2.6/SSP1 and RCP8.5/SSP5."
  9: "The approach takes stock of urban populations\u2019 adaptation and exposure\
    \ to heat in 3820 cities across the globe for the full spectrum of climate trajectories\
    \ and socio-economic pathways until the future decade (2090-2099)."
  11: A re-calibrated multivariate non-linear model is used to estimate MMT for cities
    based on climatic, topographic, and socioeconomic variables. The model is calibrated
    using historical gridded climate data (1965-1995) and applied to future climate
    projections (2064-2094) under different RCP and SSP scenarios to estimate MMT
    in 2100. Apparent temperature (AT) is calculated using daily mean temperature
    and dew point temperature, with a correction for wind speed at higher temperatures.
    Dew point temperature is derived from daily mean temperature and humidity.
  12: The study uses historical (1991-2000) and projected (2090-2099) daily mean apparent
    temperature (ATmean) data and city-specific MMTs (valid around 2000 and 2100)
    to determine the number of days exceeding the MMT threshold (EXD) and the magnitude
    of exceedance (MAG). Delta changes in EXD and MAG are calculated. Calculations
    were performed in R.

More Notes:
  3: "Distributions (c\u2013f) were trimmed. The paper uses different RCP and SSP\
    \ scenarios."
  7: Adaptation and exposure should be viewed jointly. Cities in the Middle East,
    Pakistan, parts of the USA, and northern Mexico are identified as regions where
    high increases in heat exposure coincide with small adaptation. The map in Figure
    5 was created using R (version 3.6.2) and the tmap package (version 2.3-2).
  8: EXD and MAG are used as metrics in Table 1 but are not explicitly defined on
    this page.
  9: Socio-economic growth only contributes to future heat adaptation as long as it
    is generated sustainably. A future according to RCP8.5/SSP5 would critically endanger
    cities in arid and semi-arid climates.
  11: The analysis uses GDP/capita as a socio-economic variable and considers different
    Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) for future projections. Topography is included
    as a fixed variable in the model. The model is calibrated using data from 400
    cities across all climate zones.
  12: The study accounts for long-term physiological acclimatization by using long-term
    climate variables to derive MMTs.

    \ 7.9\xB0C for RCP8.5/SSP5, and the lowest is 3.7\xB0C for RCP4.5 with SSP3."

    \ (\u2206 MMT). Presents distributions of changes in exceedance days (\u2206 EXD)\
    \ and exceedance magnitude (\u2206 MAG) from 1991-2000 to 2090-2099."

    \ in Antofagasta, Chile, and increases of up to +92 EXD in Ciudad Obreg\xF3n,\
    \ Mexico."
  7: "Under RCP8.5/SSP5, 1150 (30%) cities will experience additional EXD and 1459\
    \ (38%) a larger MAG. 705 (18%) cities will face more than one fourth of the year\
    \ being EXD and 185 (5%) cities half the year being EXD. For five cities the projection\
    \ is almost the entire year to be EXD (> 350 EXD). Under RCP2.6/SSP1, only 224\
    \ (6%) cities will face additional EXD and 338 (9%) a higher MAG. The majority\
    \ of cities in 2090\u20132099 will profit from less EXD (3207 cities, 84%) and\
    \ from a lower MAG (3074 cities, 80%)."

    \ metrics like Days reduction/increase in EXD, percentage of year EXD, and reduction/increase\
    \ in MAG [\xB0C]."
  9: Cities will face 5.1 times more frequent heat exposures and 4.3 times higher
    exposure magnitudes in RCP8.5/SSP5 than in RCP2.6/SSP1.
  11: "The RMSE of the re-calibrated model ranked at 3.2 \xB0C while the RMSE of the\
    \ original model was 2.8 \xB0C"
  12: The study calculates the change in the number of exposure days (/Delta1EXD)
    and the change in mean exceedance magnitude (/Delta1MAG) between 1991-2000 and
    2090-2099 for 3820 cities under 15 different RCP/SSP setups.
