Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (increasing temperature trend, more frequent/intense/longer-lasting
    heat events); socio-economic pathways (economic growth)
  3: Different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSPs) are used to project future climate conditions.
  4: Different RCP/SSP combinations (climate change scenarios and socioeconomic development
    pathways), climate variables and GDP/capita. The interaction between GDP/capita
    and climate change impacts drive the adaptation change.
  8: Increased heat exposure magnitude in major cities worldwide.
  11: Increased frequency and magnitude of exceedance of minimum mortality temperatures
    (MMT) due to climate change (specifically, changes in daily mean temperature,
    humidity, and wind speed).
  12: The primary driver of risk is climate change, specifically changing temperatures
    and heat waves, represented by different RCP/SSP scenarios.  The study examines
    the impact of these changes on heat exposure in cities.
Highlights:
  1: "Human adaptation to heat can broadly keep the negative health effects of global\
    \ warming in check, but the trade-offs are highly contingent on the scenario path\
    \ and location. High economic growth is needed under high-forcing climate scenarios\
    \ to maintain MMTs and level-off negative health effects. A 2\xB0C-compatible\
    \ climate trajectory alleviates the dependence on fast growth."
  3: The paper focuses on the distribution of changes in key climate variables under
    different climate change scenarios.
  4: High GDP/capita is an advantageous precondition for adaptation, but does not
    guarantee a better bearable situation regarding future heat and related mortality.
    Changes in adaptation are driven by GDP/capita in Western Europe, North America,
    East Asia, Oceania, and coastal South America under RCP2.6/SSP1, whereas climate
    change is the primary driver in Eastern European cities. Adaptation gain is lowest
    and slowest in cities in Northern Africa, the Middle East, and coastal Nigeria.
  8: The study jointly assesses future adaptation and heat exposure for a large number
    of cities. It identifies the least unfavorable choice for human health outcomes
    considering potential adaptation and exposure changes until 2100.
  11: No relevant information
  12: The study quantifies changes in heat exposure in cities under different climate
    change scenarios by assessing changes in the number of days exceeding a heat adaptation
    threshold and the magnitude of those exceedances.
Methodology:
  3: The analysis involves simulating climate futures using RCP/SSP combinations and
    analyzing distributions of various climate parameters (MMT, EXD, MAG).
  4: The study uses a city sample and analyzes the change in adaptation and exposure
    based on different RCP/SSP combinations. It calculates changes in climate variables
    and GDP/capita until 2100 and their isolated effects on /Delta1MMT. It identifies
    the greatest weighted variable change for each city to determine primary contributors
    to /Delta1MMT.
  8: The analysis assesses future adaptation and heat exposure for 3820 cities worldwide
    under different climate trajectories (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) and socio-economic
    pathways (SSPs 1-5) until 2100. It contrasts two options of high socio-economic
    development but diverging heat exposure.
  11: Estimates future MMTs for cities based on climate (historical and projected
    temperature and humidity), topographic, and socio-economic variables (GDP/capita,
    access to water). The methodology uses a re-calibrated multivariate non-linear
    model. Historical climate data from 1965-1995 is used to estimate MMTs for 2000.
    Future climate data from 2064-2094 is used to estimate MMTs for 2100.
  12: The study uses a modeling approach based on historic and projected MMTs (a measure
    of human heat adaptation) for cities.  It calculates the number of days per year
    where the daily mean apparent temperature exceeds the MMT threshold. This is done
    for a historic reference period (1991-2000) and a future period (2090-2099) under
    different RCP/SSP scenarios.  Calculations are performed in R.
More Notes:
  1: The paper uses minimum mortality temperature (MMT) as an indicator of human long-term
    adaptation to heat.
  3: The distributions (c-f) are trimmed, and vertical lines on figures indicate distributions'
    medians. The paper uses RCPs (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) coupled with SSPs (1, 2, 3,
    4, 5).
  8: The study focuses on human health outcomes related to heat exposure and adaptation
    options at the city level, not on direct macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes at the
    national level.
  11: The study uses data from the ISIMIP project and considers multiple RCP and SSP
    combinations to estimate MMTs in the future. The MMT is used as a threshold to
    assess the frequency of days that show exceedance and the magnitude of exceedance
    of MMTs.
  12: The paper analyzes how heat exposure changes by comparing a historical period
    (1991-2000) to a future period (2090-2099). It uses MMTs (measure of human heat
    adaptation) as thresholds, and it analyses across 3820 cities and many RCP/SSP
    combinations. The MMTs are specific to cities, and are calculated for the years
    around the prediction years 2000 and 2100.

  12: The study focuses on heat exposure and its impact on human heat adaptation in
    cities, measured by the number of days exceeding a threshold of human heat adaptation
    (MMT), as well as the magnitude of exceedance. This may indirectly impact economic
    outcomes if human health is affected, but this link is not explicitly quantified
    on this page.

    cities against contemporary conditions.

    MAG, as well as parameter changes between 2000-2100 for MMT and 1991-2000 to 2090-2099
    for EXD and MAG; specific values (20, 30, 40, 10, 050, 100, 150, -100, -500, 50,
    0.00, 0.1, 0.20, 0.3, 0.40, 0.5, -1.0, -0.5, 0.00, 0.5, 1.0) seem to mark ranges
    on the x-axes for these distributions.
