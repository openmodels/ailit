Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increasing global temperatures leading to increased worker exposure to extreme
    heat, which impacts task performance, learning and cognition.
  2: Outside ambient air temperature.
  6: Maximum daily temperature is the primary driver of risk; also, the type of occupation
    (manual workers in outdoor-based settings are more vulnerable).
  7: Daily maximum temperature (in degrees Celsius). Air pollution (PM2.5) is considered
    as a control variable.
  8: Increasing maximum temperatures have a linear relationship with increased occupational
    health claims for most of the temperature distribution.
  10: Increases in maximum temperature.
  11: Maximum daily temperature.
  12: The driver of risk is maximum temperature.
  13: Maximum daily temperature.
  14: High outside temperature
Highlights:
  1: "Extreme heat leads to significantly more worker health claims; adverse effects\
    \ have not diminished over time, with the largest effect observed for 2015\u2013\
    2020, indicating increasing vulnerability; workers most adversely affected are\
    \ female, older-aged, and higher-earning."
  2: "Higher maximum temperatures generate significantly more claims. The adverse\
    \ impacts of high temperatures are observed throughout the 35 years despite considerable\
    \ economic and heat-related policy changes, with the largest effect observed for\
    \ the 2015\u20132020 period. Laborers and tradespersons are particularly vulnerable,\
    \ especially in outdoor industries like agriculture and construction."
  4: No relevant information
  6: Higher temperatures increase occupational health claims, particularly for laborers
    and tradespersons; the effect of temperature has decreased slightly over time,
    possibly due to compositional changes in the labor force.
  7: Higher temperatures lead to increased occupational health claims, particularly
    for outdoor and manual labor occupations. The effect may be larger in warmer climates/more
    recent years, implying limits to adaptation.
  8: "A warming climate would adversely impact workers\u2019 health; fewer claims\
    \ occur when temperatures exceed 36 \xB0C, potentially due to mitigation measures\
    \ in Victoria, such as cessation of work at 35 \xB0C."
  11: Laborers and tradespersons in agriculture, forestry, and fishing and construction
    are most impacted by temperature increases. Young males have a larger effect of
    temperature but the point estimate for females is larger when looking within high-risk
    industries and occupations. Low-, medium- and high-income earners are similarly
    impacted by heat. Workers in large firms are less affected by temperature than
    those working in medium and small firms.
  12: "The percentage increase in claims is largest at typically 'safer' firms. Low\
    \ claim firms experience a 0.69% total increase in claims for each additional\
    \ 1 \u25E6C in daily maximum."
  13: Increased temperatures lead to increased occupational health claims and associated
    costs, with workers bearing the majority of the cost through loss of future earnings.
  14: "High outside temperature has a significant negative effect on workers\u2019\
    \ health, particularly for manual workers in outdoor-based industries. The effects\
    \ of heat are largest in recent years, which have also been the hottest, supporting\
    \ the proposal that there are limits on workers\u2019 ability to adapt. Adverse\
    \ temperature effects are observed throughout the 35-year analysis period, despite\
    \ policy attempts to address the risks."
Methodology:
  1: "Analysis uses records spanning 1985\u20132020 from an Australian mandatory insurance\
    \ scheme."
  2: "The study uses a large administrative database of over two million occupational\
    \ health claims submitted to a state-run mandatory workers\u2019 compensation\
    \ scheme in the Australian state of Victoria from 1985 to 2020. It compares differences\
    \ in accident rates across days within the same postcode and month."
  6: Regression analysis (Poisson and OLS) with standard errors clustered at the postcode
    level; analysis performed on occupational health claims data from Victoria, Australia,
    covering a period possibly from the 1980s to 2020.
  7: Poisson regression is used to estimate the effects of daily maximum temperature
    on the number of occupational health claims in a postcode. Fixed effects are used
    to control for various factors (month-year-postcode, calendar date, postcode-month,
    month-year, and day of week). Analysis is applicable to Australia.
  8: Analysis is performed using Poisson regression with month-year-postcode fixed
    effects; outcome variable is the number of claims per postcode, with robust standard
    errors clustered by postcode.
  10: Poisson regression with Month-Year-Postcode fixed effects, analyzing claims
    data from 2000-2020 in high-risk occupations, standard errors clustered by postcode.
  11: "Poisson regression with Month-Year-Postcode fixed effects, robust standard\
    \ errors clustered at postcode level. Analysis covers 2000-2020. Semi-elasticity\
    \ represents combined effect of current and previous day's maximum temperature.\
    \ Analysis of nonlinearity using temperature bins compared to a baseline of 18-21\xB0\
    C."
  12: Poisson regression is used to estimate the effect of maximum temperature on
    the number of claims, controlling for Month-Year-Postcode fixed effects. A two-stage
    approach is used to analyse the firm-level impacts.
  13: Poisson regression on occupational health claims for laborers and tradespersons
    between 2005 and 2019 for a subset of firms in Construction, Manufacturing and
    Agriculture, Forestry & Fishing in Victoria, Australia. Estimates are based on
    claims from 'high claims' and 'low claims' firms using firm fixed effects. Month-Year-Postcode
    fixed effects are included. Costs are estimated using unit costs of AU$258,700
    for claims and AU$126,500 for all occupational injuries and diseases.
  14: Calculates change in annual number of claims using estimates for temperature
    bins. Unique firm-level panel data used.
More Notes:
  1: The magnitude of any heat-accident relationship may be context-specific, depending
    upon location, time-period, and industrial relations and mitigation contexts.
  4: "The paper uses workers\u2019 compensation claims as a measure, which could be\
    \ related to climate change impacts through occupational health and safety. The\
    \ relevance to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes depends on how strongly\
    \ these claims correlate with productivity, healthcare costs, or other relevant\
    \ indicators. The time frame is from 1985 to 2020. The location of the study is\
    \ Victoria, Australia."
  6: The study acknowledges that illnesses caused by long-term heat exposure aren't
    detected. It finds that heat has remained a significant threat to manual workers
    despite policy attempts to address the risk. Workers may select into occupations
    based on their perceived ability to tolerate working in high temperatures, which
    likely represents a conservative estimate for the true difference in risk between
    occupations.
  11: The study uses claims data, likely workers' compensation claims, as a proxy
    for heat-related impacts. P-values are adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing.
  13: The adverse impact of heat is not limited to typically 'unsafe' firms. The effect
    of temperature on claims differs between 'low claims' and 'high claims' firms.
    Claims at low claims firms are more affected by same-day temperature while high
    claim firms are more affected by the previous day's temperature.
  14: The study focuses on Victoria, Australia.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Reductions in long-term earnings and productivity; higher business costs (e.g.
    recruitment and training of substitute workers); potential exacerbation of economic
    inequalities.
  2: The study estimates the cost of heat-related accidents in Victoria.
  4: No relevant information
  6: Occupational health claims, which can be interpreted as a proxy for productivity
    loss due to workplace accidents and illnesses.
  7: Increased occupational health claims due to temperature increases.
  10: Productivity loss in high-risk occupations (laborers and tradespersons) due
    to increased workplace accidents.
  11: Increase/decrease in the number of claims related to heat exposure across different
    industries and demographics.
  12: The paper examines the impact of maximum temperature on the number of worker's
    compensation claims.

Quantitative material:
  2: "A one-degree Celsius increase in the daily maximum increases claims by 0.24%;\
    \ a day reaching 33\u201336 \u25E6C averages 5.3% more claims than a day 18\u2013\
    21 \u25E6C."
  6: "A 1\xB0C increase in maximum temperature results in a 0.24% increase in the\
    \ number of claims or an additional 0.5 claims in Victoria per day."
  7: A 1 degree Celsius increase in daily maximum temperature is associated with a
    0.24% increase in occupational health claims overall (semi-elasticity from main
    specification, Table 2, column 1). The effect is higher for high-risk occupations
    such as tradespersons/related workers (0.38%) and laborers/related workers (0.33%)
    overall.
  8: "Laborers and tradespersons make 6.2% additional health claims when temperatures\
    \ are 33\u201336 \xB0C versus 18\u201321 \xB0C; temperatures over 36 \xB0C result\
    \ in fewer claims."
  10: "A 1\xB0C increase in maximum temperature causes a 2.11% increase in heat-related\
    \ claims for laborers and tradespersons since 2000. 1\xB0C increase in temperature\
    \ increases the number of claims by workers in Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing."
  11: "Semi-elasticity estimates (%) representing the percentage change in the number\
    \ of claims for each 1\xB0C increase in daily maximum temperature, broken down\
    \ by industry, occupation, gender, age, and income."
  12: Table 6 provides semi-elasticity estimates (percentage change in claims) related
    to temperature for different worker characteristics. For example, a 1-degree increase
    in maximum temperature is associated with a 0.35% increase in claims for all male
    workers, 0.46% increase for male laborers and tradespersons, and 0.48% increase
    for male laborers and tradespersons in agriculture or construction. For All Claims
    it is a 0.25% increase.
  13: "A warming of Victoria's climate by 1.5\xB0C would result in an additional 0.38%\
    \ occupational health claims for all workers, equating to an additional 156 claims\
    \ per annum at a cost of AU $40.3 million for Victoria. If we consider all injuries\
    \ and diseases, regardless of compensation, the annual cost of 1.5\xB0C of warming\
    \ is AU$54.8 million, of which laborers and tradespersons account for AU$37.4\
    \ million."
  14: "Past warming has an average per annum cost of AU$26.3 million for claims and\
    \ AU$35.6 million for all workplace injuries and diseases in Victoria. For laborers\
    \ and tradespersons, the annual costs are AU$15.6 million for claims and AU$21.2\
    \ million overall. A 1.5 \u25E6C increase in temperatures costing an additional\
    \ AU $54.8million each year in heat-related injuries and diseases at work."
