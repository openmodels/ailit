Drivers of Risk:
  2: Sea-level rise, cumulative erosion, and storm events
  3: Intensifying coastal hazards, including shoreline erosion, storm flooding, and
    sea-level rise; Increasing population density and infrastructural development
    in coastal zones.
  11: Increasing cost of nourishment, indexed as the price of sand per unit volume;
    disparities in property values among series of towns alongshore
  12: Removal of government subsidies for beach nourishment could reduce coastal property
    values by up to 60%.
  13: Chronic system of 'suckers' experiencing exacerbated erosion rates and needing
    more frequent nourishment, in contrast to 'free-riders' benefiting from sand supplied
    by updrift neighbors.
  14: Inefficient resource use due to the 'tragedy of the commons' and free-riding
    behavior in asymmetrical common-pool resources (e.g., upstream water users negatively
    impacting downstream users).
  15: Uncoordinated shoreline management decisions between towns; Rapid depletion
    of coastal sediment resources.
  17: Sea-level rise (SLR)
  18: Sea-level rise (3 mm/yr and 10 mm/yr scenarios) and increases in mean storm
    surge magnitude.
  19: Percent increase in mean storm surge magnitude, Sea-level rise scenarios.
  21: Sea-level rise rates, storm surge size, rate of nourishment subsidy, belief
    in forward-looking models.
  22: Sea-level rise, storm events of differing severity (overwash, storm surge),
    shoreline erosion.
  23: Storm damage to hotels, lack of coastal defense.
Highlights:
  2: "Developed barrier islands are strongly coupled human\u2013natural systems, requiring\
    \ analysis as such to understand their response to climate change over decadal\
    \ time scales. Human interventions have become a significant dynamical component\
    \ of developed barrier-island system evolution."
  11: Potential for a runaway feedback of nourishment frequency increasing with nourishment
    cost, catalyzing a kind of arms race among neighboring towns for access to beach
    nourishment material and infrastructure; inequity in the efficacy of coastal towns
    with differing property values alongshore.
  12: Spatially myopic nourishment decisions by independent manager agents can destabilize
    long-term coastal behavior, leading to chaotic shoreline evolution.
  13: The page discusses the spatial patterns of shoreline erosion and accretion due
    to nourishment and the socio-economic disparities arising from these patterns.
  14: Asymmetrical commons present a particularly difficult dynamical problem because
    upstream users lack incentives to account for downstream users, leading to potential
    resource depletion and free-riding behavior.
  15: A holistic management approach is necessary to avoid rapid depletion of coastal
    sediment resources and severe economic disparities in defense capacity even across
    coastal towns within the same region.
  17: Non-believers in projected environmental change are more likely to own property
    during periods of high risk. Disaster assistance typically represents income transfers
    from taxpayers as a whole to affected populations, and the systematic selection
    of non-believers into the property market means that broader society is funding
    repairs for damages that the average citizen would not have suffered.
  18: Time to abandonment decreases as storm magnitude increases. Cumulative damage
    leading up to abandonment is a major factor, suggesting abandonment is driven
    by additive damage.
  19: Increased storm surge magnitude accelerates abandonment and increases damage.
    Beach nourishment subsidies delay abandonment and reduce damage.
  20: Increasing the weight agents give to forecasts of barrier evolution causes both
    time to abandonment and damage to decrease, particularly when the rates of sea-level
    rise are high.
  21: The timing of systemic instability under conditions representative of developed
    barriers today is controlled by a range of forcing factors including physical,
    policy and psychological.
  22: Long-term dynamics of developed coastlines and coastal-resort economies, when
    modeled over centuries, reveal potential boom and bust cycles.
  23: The model predicts an emergent boom-and-bust pattern in the dynamical behavior
    of a developed barrier island, oscillating in both space and time. Sections of
    a barrier may be abandoned after storm damage, but redevelopment can occur if
    projected profits are high enough.
Methodology:
  2: "Analysis focuses on barrier islands as strongly coupled human\u2013natural systems\
    \ to understand responses to climate change over decadal time scales."
  3: The paper defines risk as the likelihood of a hazard event multiplied by the
    value of susceptible assets and infrastructure.
  12: Control theory approach with numerical models coupling agent-based decision-making
    to large-scale coastline behavior.
  14: Conceptual modeling and illustration of a potential dynamic using an irrigation
    system as an example of asymmetrical commons.
  17: Coupled model with coastal home-owner agents who can buy and sell coastal properties;
    extends previous work on developed barrier abandonment.
  18: Simulations are run for two sea-level rise scenarios on a modeled barrier island.
    The impact of increased mean storm surge magnitude on time to abandonment and
    total damage is examined.
  19: Simulation model of a hypothetical developed barrier island.
  21: Extensions of the coupled model by McNamara and Keeler (2013).
  22: Coupled a three-dimensional numerical model of barrier-island evolution with
    an agent-based model of tourism development.
  23: Agent-based model simulating resort development, coastal defense, and economic
    collapse. Model includes developer agents, hotel-owning agents, and tourist agents
    with utility functions tied to economic and beach parameters. Decisions are made
    at the individual level (building hotels, bidding on hotels, vacationing, setting
    room prices) based on profit maximization and market indicators.
More Notes:
  3: The paper is an introduction to a study, setting the stage for an analysis of
    risk and coastal management in barrier islands. It highlights the increasing hazard
    and risk in developed barrier islands and the complex interactions between human
    activities and coastal change. It is a preprint and not peer-reviewed.
  13: Discussion connects beach nourishment to the broader discourse on common-pool
    resource systems and their social and natural dynamics.
  14: The page focuses on the dynamics of common-pool resources, highlighting how
    incentives and spatial asymmetry can lead to inefficient resource allocation and
    potential negative consequences for downstream users. Although this paper is not
    directly quantifying macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, it provides relevant insights
    into possible negative effects for agricultural output and productivity. These
    factors should be considered and investigated further for a more detailed macro-level
    assessment.
  15: The paper suggests caution regarding hasty changes in coastline mitigation practices.
  17: The model begins with an initial physical barrier-island state similar to barriers
    found along the North Carolina Outer Banks, USA.
  19: The study focuses on a specific coastal setting (barrier island) and does not
    directly address nationwide macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, but it highlights
    the potential impact of climate change and policy on coastal property values and
    associated costs. The nourishment subsidy is funded from taxes paid by national
    population, not just local coastal property owners.
  20: The analysis focuses on abandonment decisions, which could have broader economic
    implications but these are not explicitly quantified on this page. The analysis
    uses an agent-based model to examine the impact of perceptions of environmental
    change.
  21: The paper focuses on barrier islands, which may be relevant for nations with
    significant coastal assets vulnerable to sea-level rise. The model includes psychological
    factors (belief in forward-looking models), which is a novel aspect.
  22: The model includes heterogeneous economic agents (developers, hotel owners,
    tourists) interacting in a simulated real estate market and a policy agent who
    decides when to implement beach and dune nourishment based on a cost-benefit analysis.
  23: The model simulates the cycle of resort development, coastal defense, and economic
    collapse.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: High-density development on U.S. barrier islands will likely cease to exist in
    its current configuration.
  3: The paper focuses on risk to assets and infrastructure in coastal zones, particularly
    barrier islands. It implicitly connects this to economic conditions, mentioning
    potential adverse effects on economic conditions within a community.
  11: Net economic benefits of beach nourishment, nourishment cost
  14: The page does not directly quantify macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes but describes
    the dynamics of resource use, particularly in 'asymmetrical commons,' which can
    indirectly impact productivity and economic well-being.
  15: Unequal access to nourishment sand as a resource leads to towns with high property
    values being able to afford mitigation and withstand coastal hazards, while less
    wealthy towns cannot.
  17: Property damage; disaster assistance (as income transfers from taxpayers)
  18: Time elapsed before coastal inhabitants abandon their property and total damage
    that occurs prior to abandonment.
  19: Total damage sustained, Time to abandonment.
  20: Damage ($/yr)
  21: Total damage sustained (in $/yr) related to barrier island abandonment.
  22: Boom and bust cycles in coastal-resort economies and the timing of barrier abandonment.
  23: Boom-and-bust pattern in the dynamical behavior of a developed barrier island.
Quantitative material:
  18: Time to abandonment is reduced as storm magnitude increases. Amount of damage
    increases significantly with larger increases in mean storm surge magnitude.
  19: Figure 12.2 shows elapsed time before abandonment (years) and total damage ($/year
    x 10^4) as a function of percent increase in mean storm surge magnitude for 'worst-case'
    and 'calm' sea-level rise scenarios. Figure 12.3 suggests abandonment time and
    damage increase with beach nourishment subsidies.
  21: Figure 12.4 shows total damage (x 10^4 $/yr) as a function of the elapsed time
    before abandonment (years) and the average agent science weighting under 'worst-case'
    and 'calm' sea-level rise scenarios.
