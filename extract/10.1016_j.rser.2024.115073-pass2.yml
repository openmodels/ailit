Drivers of Risk:
  1: Environmental factors (unspecified on this page)
  2: Factors impacting outcomes include solar irradiance, temperature, atmospheric
    conditions, terrain effects, extreme weather events, and long-term irradiance
    changes.
  3: Environmental factors such as solar irradiance, ambient air temperature, atmospheric
    conditions, terrain effects, extreme events, and long-term changes impact solar
    PV performance.
  5: Spectral distribution of solar irradiance, including Average Photon Energy (APE),
    influences PV module performance; higher ambient air temperatures hinder cooling
    of PV modules and thus increase cell temperatures; heat production by solar PV
    farms can raise the surrounding temperature.
  6: Solar insolation and ambient air temperature are the two main environmental factors
    affecting solar PV output; irradiance has a stronger effect on current, and temperature
    predominantly affects voltage.
  7: Temperature elevation at the module surface impacts solar PV module efficiency.
  8: Elevated temperatures are identified as a key driver of risk, reducing efficiency
    and accelerating degradation. Cloud cover, pollutants, humidity, dust, and wind
    speeds also affect PV output.
  11: The paper identifies dust accumulation and humidity as key environmental factors
    impacting solar PV performance.
  12: Wind increases efficiency by cooling modules, especially during peak sunlight
    hours, and reduces soiling by blowing away accumulation of dust and snow. Extreme
    winds conditions can compromise structural security, requiring adequate design
    margins.
  13: Changes in albedo due to land cover changes (deforestation, afforestation, urbanization,
    snow cover), snow cover, wildfires (smoke aerosols), and hailstorms.
  14: Hailstorms causing damage to PV modules; hurricanes causing damage to modules,
    mounts, and wiring; solar eclipses reducing solar irradiance.
  15: Potential risks include climatic events such as eclipses and long-term changes
    in irradiance due to increased humidity, wildfires, hailstorms, and cloud cover
    changes.
  16: Solar irradiance, temperature, cloud cover, dust and pollutants, snow cover,
    albedo, and extreme weather events.

Highlights:
  2: Solar irradiance variability is a significant factor; atmospheric conditions
    can reduce output by up to 60%; extreme weather causes substantial damage; tailored
    strategies are highlighted as necessary for maintaining PV performance in varied
    climates.
  3: Solar PV performance is affected by environmental factors; understanding these
    is necessary for optimizing performance, predicting performance, managing variability,
    and evaluating environmental impacts.
  5: "PV module performance is sensitive to spectral distribution and ambient air\
    \ temperature; irradiance has a stronger effect on short-circuit current than\
    \ on open-circuit voltage; power output increases near-linearly with irradiance;\
    \ spectral distribution, as reflected in APE, is often overlooked in PV modules\u2019\
    \ performance assessment."
  6: "Short-circuit current density increases linearly with irradiance intensity;\
    \ open-circuit voltage decreases with the inverse of irradiance intensity; efficiency\
    \ tends to have a peak around 100 W/m\xB2 and then decreases slightly with increasing\
    \ irradiance intensity; fill factor decreases sharply at lower irradiance intensity\
    \ and stabilizes as intensity increases."
  7: Higher temperatures lead to a decrease in the power output of solar PV modules.
  8: High temperatures negatively impact solar cell performance by shrinking the band
    gap, increasing leakage current, and accelerating degradation. Different PV technologies
    have varying temperature coefficients, influencing their suitability for different
    climates. Cooling methods can mitigate the effects of elevated temperatures.
  11: ''
  12: Wind can both increase and decrease the performance of solar PV depending on
    the conditions. Albedo varies considerably across the globe and by season, indicating
    regional differences in surface reflectivity.
  13: Albedo changes affect the amount of sunlight reflected onto solar modules. Snow
    cover reduces solar irradiance received by modules. Wildfires reduce solar PV
    performance by blocking sunlight with aerosols. Hailstorms cause physical damage
    to solar panels.
  14: Hurricanes can damage solar PV installations, but proper design and installation
    can mitigate these risks; Solar eclipses cause a rapid but short-lived fall in
    solar power generation, affecting grid stability; Hail can cause microcracks in
    solar cells, leading to reduced power output over time.
  15: Eclipses can significantly disrupt solar PV systems in regions with high solar
    capacity and no grid connection. Long-term changes like increased temperature
    and cloud cover may double low output days in worst-affected regions.
  16: The individual and combined effects of several key factors must be understood
    and mitigated to optimize PV output. Solar irradiance is the most significant
    factor affecting PV performance, with the strongest impact near the equator. Technologies
    to mitigate these effects through cooling and cleaning panels therefore deserve
    particular attention to maintain high performance in many world regions. Cold
    regions see mixed effects, with the higher albedo of snow increasing output, but
    snow coverage of panels reducing it. Extreme weather events like hailstorms and
    wildfires can critically damage PV systems, while wildfire smoke and solar eclipses
    cause large and highly localized reductions in output. Long-term changes in solar
    radiation, driven by climate change and air pollution will present future challenges
    for maintaining PV efficiency.
