Drivers of Risk:
  1: Annual temperature shocks
  2: Weather variability, climate change, hot temperatures
  4: Temperature shocks.
  5: Weather, climate change, changes in global temperature
  6: Climate change impacts are partitioned between output and TFP, where a fraction
    of impacts harms TFP growth.
  7: Temperature, Precipitation
  9: Annual changes in temperature, particularly in low-income countries
  10: Annual temperature changes and annual precipitation changes.
  11: Temperature shocks are impacting the outcomes.
  12: Annual temperature change
  13: Temperature and precipitation changes are identified as drivers impacting TFP
    growth rate.
  14: Changes in temperature (/Delta1Temp) and precipitation (/Delta1Pre); average
    temperature and average GDP per capita are also considered
  15: Annual changes in temperature (Delta1Temp) and precipitation (Delta1Pre)
  17: Temperature shocks (weather shocks).
  18: Changes in temperature and precipitation.
  19: "Climate change, specifically average warming of 3.912\xB0C by the end of the\
    \ century"
  20: Temperature shocks
  21: Temperature shocks, particularly in countries with high poverty, have significant
    effects on productivity.
Highlights:
  1: A negative relationship between annual temperature shocks and TFP growth exists
    only in poor countries; the impact is indistinguishable from zero in rich countries.
  2: Presents econometric evidence of the impact of weather and climate on total factor
    productivity growth, finding the average effect size is small.
  4: Provides a useful empirical test for the plausibility of the recent hypothesis
    of an impact of climate change on TFP growth; First study to examine the macro
    relationship between temperature shocks and TFP growth; Provides direct, and not
    just indirect, evidence on the economic growth.
  5: Climate change impacts long-run economic growth by reducing current output, savings,
    and investment if there are only level effects. The impacts can be much more substantial
    if climate change also affects TFP.
  6: Climate change impacts on TFP growth can significantly reduce future consumption
    possibilities.
  7: There is a negative correlation between TFP and temperature levels in 2006.
  9: The negative effects of temperature changes on TFP growth rates are concentrated
    in poor countries. Being hot also weakens TFP but this is potentially due to the
    definitions of hot and poor overlapping to a good extent.
  10: Temperature increases have a negative and statistically significant impact on
    TFP growth in poor countries. The effect is not significant in hot countries (when
    controlling for poverty).
  11: The paper finds a pattern of heterogeneity in impacts between rich and poor
    countries, with the negative effects of annual temperature coming through being
    poor.
  12: There is no evidence of meaningful non-linear effects of temperature shocks
    on TFP. Countries at different levels of development respond differently to weather
    shocks. The relationship between TFP growth and temperature shocks is mediated
    by income rather than solely by temperature. Heterogenous climates in rich and
    poor countries do not account for the heterogenous impacts.
  13: Significant negative effects of temperature increases on productivity are observed,
    particularly in poor and hot countries, with squared temperature changes reinforcing
    these effects.
  14: "The negative impact of temperature shocks on TFP growth diminishes as countries\
    \ become richer. A 1\xB0C annual increase becomes zero when income is approximately\
    \ $34,400 per person per year for countries classified as 'hot', approximately\
    \ $14,900 per person per year for countries not classified as 'hot', and approximately\
    \ $25,600 per person per year for the sample as a whole."
  15: Temperature increases have a negative impact on TFP growth, especially in poorer
    countries. The marginal effect of temperature change varies with GDP per capita
    levels, with higher GDP per capita countries being less vulnerable (as illustrated
    in Fig. 2). Institutional quality (Polity2) also moderates the impact of temperature
    changes on TFP growth.
  17: Temperature shocks have a negative and significant impact on TFP growth and
    labor productivity growth only in poor countries; This impact is due to differences
    in levels of development and composition of TFP, which make poor countries more
    vulnerable to temperature shocks.
  18: Temperature increases have a negative and statistically significant impact on
    labour productivity growth in poor countries. Precipitation changes have a negative
    and statistically significant impact on labour productivity growth.
  19: Climate change will disproportionately affect TFP growth in poor countries compared
    to rich countries. Negative impacts of climate change on TFP disappear once a
    certain income per capita threshold of $34,400 (for hot countries) is reached.
  20: Temperature shocks have a negative relationship with TFP growth in poor countries.
  21: The central finding is that TFP growth rates in poorer countries are affected
    by temperature shocks, identifying poverty as a key vulnerability factor.
Methodology:
  1: "Examining the relationship between annual temperature shocks and TFP growth\
    \ rates using macro TFP data from the Penn World Table for the period 1960\u2013\
    2006."
  2: Econometric evidence of the impact of weather and climate on total factor productivity
    growth.
  4: "Panel dataset for 60 countries, covering the period 1960\u20132006, testing\
    \ the hypothesis of a causal relationship between temperature shocks and annual\
    \ TFP growth rates."
  5: "The analysis follows Dietz and Stern (2015) and considers a standard DICE (Dynamic\
    \ Integrated Climate-Economy) model, a Ramsey\u2013Cass\u2013Koopmans growth model\
    \ with climate externality and emission abatement costs. The model includes equations\
    \ for output (Yt), capital accumulation (Kt+1), damage function (\u03A9Yt), and\
    \ TFP growth (At+1)."
  6: TFP data are taken from the Penn World Table (PWT 8.1) using the RTFPNA data
    series. Annual RTFPNA growth rates are calculated by first-differencing. The analysis
    uses the natural logarithm of the RTFPNA index.
  7: Regression analysis using panel data from 60 countries covering 1960-2006. Temperature
    and precipitation data are first-differenced to ensure stationary residuals.
  9: Regression analysis with country-level panel data, controlling for precipitation
    and interactions between temperature changes and dummy variables for being poor
    or hot. The analysis uses data from 1960 onwards.
  10: The study uses panel regression with country and region-time fixed effects to
    analyze the relationship between annual TFP growth rates and temperature/precipitation
    changes. Standard errors are clustered at the country level.
  11: The analysis includes sensitivity tests for robustness, regression specifications,
    and interaction terms with dummies for poor and hot countries.
  12: Regression analysis interacting annual temperature change with average temperature
    and GDP per capita. Also uses temperature quartiles (cold, mild, warm, hot) for
    non-parametric analysis.
  13: The analysis includes country and region-time fixed effects, considering data
    from countries categorized by GDP per capita and average temperature metrics as
    of the 1960s.
  14: Panel regression analysis with country fixed effects and Region x Time fixed
    effects is used to examine the non-linear relationship between temperature impacts
    and TFP growth. Standard errors are clustered at the country level. The analysis
    considers temperature in quartiles to capture non-linear temperature effects.
  15: Panel data regression analysis with country fixed effects and Region x Time
    fixed effects, clustered standard errors at the country level. The analysis uses
    data up to 2014, given the Polity IV Project data.
  17: Regression analysis using annual TFP growth and annual labor productivity growth
    as dependent variables, focusing on differences between rich and poor countries.
    Data on labor productivity is obtained from Penn World Table, PWT 8.1.
  18: The analysis uses panel regressions with country fixed effects and Region x
    Time fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the country level. The sample
    size is 2760.
  19: Uses projections of future warming in conjunction with benchmark estimates to
    predict the impact on TFP growth. The paper estimates the short-run semi-elasticity
    rather than the long-run one.
  20: Examined the relationship between TFP growth rates and temperature shocks using
    first differences of TFP and temperature levels.
  21: Analysis is based on historical weather variations and TFP data, with suggestions
    for future research using country, year, and industry-specific data.
More Notes:
  1: The study extrapolates from weather to climate and suggests climate change in
    poor countries increases concerns over distributional issues and restates the
    case for complementarity between climate policy and poverty reduction.
  2: Distinguishes between static (level) and dynamic (growth) effects of climate
    change, noting growth effects compound over time and permanently reduce output.
  5: The paper aims to show the persistence of weather impacts on economic activity
    by focusing on TFP, not GDP growth rate. It also links macro literature with micro
    studies on temperature and human physiology by showing that the main reason behind
    TFP growth impact in poor countries is labour productivity.
  7: The choice of countries is based on data availability. There is a huge variation
    in both the annual growth rates of TFP and temperature changes.
  9: The paper acknowledges limitations in identifying the specific channel through
    which temperature affects TFP, and treats precipitation results with caution due
    to sensitivity to specifications.
  10: The definition of 'poor' is based on GDP per capita relative to the median in
    1960 or the median across the 1960-2006 period. 'Hot' is defined based on the
    median or 75th percentile of average temperatures in the 1960s.
  14: The interaction between temperature changes and GDP per capita is positive and
    significant at the 1% level, supporting the hypothesis that the negative impact
    of temperature on TFP growth decreases with increasing income.
  15: The paper uses interactions between temperature changes and GDP per capita,
    institutional quality, and a dummy variable for 'hot' countries to explore heterogeneous
    effects.
  17: The paper suggests that the impact of temperature shocks on labor productivity
    is a key channel responsible for the temperature-TFP relationship in poor countries.
  18: The analysis uses projected warming data for the period 2071-2095 under the
    RCP 8.5 scenario.
  20: The analysis alleviates the issue of non-stationarity in panel analysis.
  21: Consideration of adaptation investment effects on TFP and calls for further
    research on dynamic effects of future climate change.

Quantitative material:
  1: "A 1 \xB0C annual increase in temperature decreases TFP growth rates by about\
    \ 1.1\u20131.8 percentage points in poor countries."
  5: The paper presents equations (1), (2), (3), and (4), which model the impact of
    climate change on output and TFP.
  6: Moyer et al. (2014) explore the consequences of different values of fA between
    1 and 100%. They show that fA /equal10.05 leads to a 70% drop in consumption per
    capita in 2300 relative to the no climate change case.
  7: "Negative correlation between TFP and temperature levels in 2006 shown in a scatterplot\
    \ (Figure 1). TFP annual growth rates vary from -56% to 27%. Temperature changes\
    \ vary between 2 and 3 \xB0C annually."
  9: "A 1\xB0C annual increase in temperature would lower TFP growth rates of countries\
    \ by 0.49% (Column 1); a 1\xB0C annual increase in temperature in poor countries\
    \ would decrease TFP growth rates by about 1.5 percentage points (Column 2)"
  10: A 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature is associated with a statistically
    significant decrease in annual TFP growth rate in poor countries, with the magnitude
    ranging from -1.14 to -1.52 percentage points depending on the model specification.
  11: There is a 5% significant impact of temperature shocks in hot countries, with
    a net effect of about -1 percentage point on the annual TFP growth.
  12: The square of annual temperature change is almost always insignificant. The
    impact of hot weather is positive in cool countries and negative in warm countries.
  13: The paper provides coefficients measuring the impact of temperature change and
    its square, as well as precipitation change on TFP growth, with significance levels
    indicated.
  14: The table presents regression results with coefficients and standard errors
    for the impact of temperature and precipitation changes on TFP growth, including
    interaction terms with average temperature, GDP per capita, and temperature quartiles
    (Cold, Mild, Warm, Hot). For example, the coefficient for /Delta1Temp is 0.884
    (p<0.01) in column (1).
  15: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature (Delta1Temp) is associated with a statistically\
    \ significant negative impact on annual TFP growth rate (coefficients and standard\
    \ errors are provided in Table 5). The effect varies based on GDP per capita and\
    \ institutional quality (Polity2)."
  17: "Negative temperature shocks lead to approximately 0.018% (SE 0.005%) per year\
    \ larger negative shocks to the annual TFP growth rate than positive shocks, calculated\
    \ from a 0.012\xB0C/year average temperature increase and a coefficient of 1.523\
    \ (from Table 2, Column (2))."
  18: The table provides regression results showing the relationship between annual
    labour productivity growth rates and changes in temperature and precipitation,
    including interaction terms with dummy variables for poor and hot countries. Coefficients
    and standard errors are reported.
  19: Climate change will entail a decrease of approximately 3 percentage points in
    TFP growth, on average, by the year 2095, compared to a scenario without climate
    change. TFP growth in poor countries will suffer from a reduction of 5.96%, compared
    to a decrease of only 0.11% in rich countries. Annual TFP growth rate in poor
    countries could be reduced by about 0.06% per year. Over almost a 100 years, total
    factor productivity in poor countries would be 5.30% below where it would be without
    climate change.
  20: Climate change would reduce TFP growth by less than 0.1% (upper bound estimate).
  21: No concrete quantitative information on outcomes of interest is provided.
