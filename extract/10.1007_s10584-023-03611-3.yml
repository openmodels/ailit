Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climatic tipping points are a significant threat to future socioeconomic development
    and drive significant increases in poverty across scenarios.
  2: Temperature change is a driver of risk, impacting economic activity and inequality.
  3: Climate change (including increased prices of food, housing, and healthcare;
    reduced labor productivity and work hours; agricultural losses; reductions in
    yields; destruction of assets from climate-related disasters)
  5: Temperature and precipitation variation identified as drivers impacting income
    disparities and inequality through agriculture.
  7: Climate change scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) are used to project future
    temperature changes.
  8: Different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) representing varying levels of
    growth, investment, mitigation, and adaptation challenges; also, population projections.
  9: Climate change, specifically changing temperatures modeled through different
    scenarios (IFs-RCP 6.0, SSP1-RCP 2.6, SSP2-RCP 4.5, SSP3-RCP 6.0, SSP4-RCP 6.0,
    SSP5-RCP 8.5).
  10: Climate change, specifically different climate scenarios (RCPs) and socioeconomic
    development pathways (SSPs).
  11: 'Climate change (specifically different RCP scenarios: 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) and
    socioeconomic pathways (SSPs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5); and the potential impact of tipping
    points.'
  12: Climate change, tipping points, and RCP scenarios (Representative Concentration
    Pathways)
  14: Technology and carbon energy systems drive greenhouse gas emissions and temperature
    increases. Climate change, specifically temperature change, is a driver of economic
    risk and poverty.
  15: Climate change.
Highlights:
  1: Long-term effects of climate change on poverty could be mitigated with sustained
    efforts to improve income distribution.
  2: Technology plays a cross-cutting role in both amplifying climate change through
    increased economic activity and potentially mitigating future greenhouse gas emissions.
  3: Climate change will remain a significant challenge for future patterns of socioeconomic
    development, with tens of millions pushed into poverty.
  5: Link between temperature increase and income inequality quantified.
  8: Future levels of average per capita GDP increase most rapidly in SSP5 and slowest
    in SSP3. Income distribution is most unequal in SSP3 and SSP4. Population growth
    is highest in SSP3. Scenarios with high challenges to adaptation show lower long-term
    growth in per person economic production and consumption.
  9: "Climate change is projected to reduce global economic growth significantly,\
    \ with potential cumulative losses ranging from $1.1\u20136.9 trillion by 2030\
    \ to $78.8\u2013344.1 trillion by 2070. Climate change is also projected to increase\
    \ global inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient."
  10: Climate change is projected to significantly increase the number of people living
    in extreme poverty, with the extent of the increase varying greatly depending
    on the specific climate and socioeconomic scenario.
  11: Climate change is projected to increase the number of people living in poverty,
    with the impact varying across different climate scenarios, socioeconomic pathways,
    and poverty thresholds. The share of the population in poverty attributable to
    climate change decreases as the income threshold increases.
  12: 'Tipping points can cause significant global GDP losses under various climate
    scenarios. Reducing income inequality can potentially offset climate-attributable
    poverty increases. In an RCP 2.6 world, global income inequality would need to
    be improved by five percent through 2070 to eliminate climate-attributable poverty. '
  14: Technology plays a dual role, with productivity improvements exacerbating fossil
    fuel emissions and renewable energy improvements mitigating them.
  15: Climate change is projected to push an additional 40 million people into extreme
    poverty by 2050 under a middle-of-the-road scenario.
Methodology:
  1: The study uses the International Futures (IFs) model, combining RCPs with economic
    growth and inequality series from the SSPs, to project poverty across income thresholds
    for 175 countries through 2070.
  2: The International Futures (IFs) modeling system is used to create scenarios and
    model the relationship between temperature change, economic activity, and inequality.
    The DICE model damage function is used to capture the general effect of climate
    change on economic growth. The analysis uses macro-level relationships and should
    be interpreted as the product of the methodology, not as point predictions.
  5: RCP temperature trajectories and damage functions used to model economic impacts
    for 175 countries from 2017 to 2070.
  7: The IFs model simulates equilibrium through stabilization of stock levels but
    does not reach full equilibrium.
  9: Uses the DICE model damage function to project the impact of climate change on
    global economic production. Analysis performed across different Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios.
  10: The analysis uses different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative
    Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to model the effect of climate change on poverty.
  11: The study uses the IFs model to project poverty under different climate scenarios
    and socioeconomic pathways. The analysis considers different poverty thresholds
    ($1.90, $3.20, $5.50) and time horizons (2030, 2050, 2070).
  12: The study uses the IFs-RCP model to project the impact of climate change and
    tipping points on global GDP and poverty. The sensitivity of the IFs-RCP model
    results to scenarios that exogenously changed the Gini coefficient for income
    inequality was tested to establish a policy-relevant relationship between inequality
    and climate-induced poverty.
  14: The analysis uses damage functions and historical data on the relationship between
    temperature change and inequality. It lacks explicitly sectoral analysis, including
    dynamics associated with the agriculture sector and an omitted relationship between
    changing energy and food prices and the purchasing power of the poor. Climate
    change is represented via temperature and not precipitation. It includes an inability
    to model shocks driven by exceeding planetary boundaries.
  15: Model-based projections using the IFs software platform.
More Notes:
  2: The manuscript focuses on poverty as the first Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)
    and one indicator of human wellbeing.
  5: No relevant information
  8: The IFs scenario is most closely aligned with SSP3 and is the most pessimistic
    across the time horizon for GDP.
  9: IFs scenario projects a more rapid population growth than most SSP scenarios,
    showing growth to 10.3 billion by 2070.
  11: The study mentions incorporating additional shocks to simulate a worst-case
    scenario aligned with estimates from recent literature (Dietz et al. 2021), specifically,
    the impact of exceeding tipping points on GDP levels over time. Figure 5 shows
    the effect of tipping points on increasing the number of people living in poverty.
  12: The analysis also considers the impact of climate change on poverty at different
    poverty thresholds ($1.90, $3.20, and $5.50 per day). It tests two additional
    relationships between temperature change and income inequality, one being an implicit
    elasticity in the work of Hallegatte et al. (2016) and a second from Dasgupta
    et al. (2020) (see Supplemental Information for more on this).
  14: The research suggests the need for technological solutions to reduce carbon
    intensity, reducing human consumption, and investing in research to understand
    climate adaptation.
  15: The authors state that this estimate is lower than other model estimates of
    the number of people pushed into poverty due to COVID-19 and intrastate conflict.
    The authors also highlight the importance of balancing socioeconomic development
    with its environmental consequences.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Economic activity (GDP) and inequality are outcomes of interest.
  3: Poverty (number of people pushed into poverty)
  5: No relevant information
  8: GDP per capita, income inequality (Gini index), population, and extreme poverty
    (less than $1.90 per day).
  9: Global economic growth, global Gini coefficient (inequality), and global poverty.
  10: The number of people falling into extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day),
    poverty (less than $3.20 per day), and moderate poverty (less than $5.50 per day)
    due to climate change. Also, an increase in inequality as measured on a scale
    of 0 to 1 and presented as a percentage increase.
  11: Number of people living in poverty (measured in millions) and the percentage
    of the impoverished population attributable to climate change.
  12: Global GDP loss and climate-attributable poverty
  14: Economic growth is negatively impacted by temperature change. Poverty is increased
    by inequality and decreased by GDP.
  15: Additional 40 million people in extreme poverty by 2050 relative to a world
    without climate change under the SSP2-RCP 4.5 scenario.
Quantitative material:
  1: If tipping points are passed, extreme poverty could grow to 57 million by 2030,
    78 million by 2050, and 56 million by 2070.
  2: The economic cost of tipping points could increase the social cost of carbon
    (SCC) by an additional 25%.
  5: A 1% increase in temperature raises the Gini coefficient for income inequality
    by 0.5 points on a 0-100-point scale.
  7: RCP 8.5 has a steady increase of average global temperature which reaches 22.4
    by 2070.
  8: GDP per capita in 2070 ranges from $25.8 thousand USD (SSP3) to $97.4 thousand
    USD (SSP5). Gini values fall by nearly 20% in scenarios with fewer challenges
    to adaptation (SSP1, SSP5). SSP3 population increases to 11.3 billion by 2070.
    SSP2 and SSP4 population peaks at 9.4 and 9.5 billion, respectively. SSP1 and
    SSP5 show declining global populations by 2070.

    of 2011 US$ and percentage change) for 2030, 2050, and 2070 under different climate
    scenarios. Table 3: Projected changes in global Gini coefficient (absolute change
    and percentage change) for 2030, 2050, and 2070 under different climate scenarios.
    Poverty levels in millions of people are given for different scenarios, with and
    without climate change.'
  10: Extreme poverty is projected to increase by 18-30 million people by 2030 under
    various scenarios. Under a specific scenario (SSP1-RCP 2.6), extreme poverty could
    increase by as little as 4 million by 2070. Under the pessimistic scenario (SSP3-RCP
    6.0), extreme poverty could increase by 30 million (2030), 78 million (2050),
    and 130 million (2070). SSP5-RCP 8.5 results in an increase of 24 million (2030),
    20 million (2050), and 39 million (2070) in extreme poverty. Inequality increases
    between 2.4 to 4.3% in 2030, 5.5 to 12.7% by 2050, and 7.5 to 23.9% by 2070 due
    to climate change.
  11: Table 4 provides projections of the number of people in poverty in 2030, 2050,
    and 2070 under different climate scenarios (RCPs) and socioeconomic pathways (SSPs)
    for poverty thresholds of $1.90, $3.20, and $5.50 per day (e.g., IFs-RCP 6.0 projects
    29.1 million people in poverty at the $1.90 threshold in 2030). By 2070, nearly
    40% of the population living on less than $1.90 per day will be attributable to
    climate change in an IFs-RCP 6.0 scenario.
  12: Table 5 shows the cumulative effect of tipping points on global GDP measured
    in trillions of 2011 US$ at market exchange rates for various RCP scenarios in
    2030, 2050, and 2070. For example, under IFs-RCP 6.0, the GDP loss is -$36.8 trillion
    in 2030, -$326.1 trillion in 2050, and -$1,112.0 trillion in 2070.
  15: 40 million people in extreme poverty by 2050 under SSP2-RCP 4.5.
