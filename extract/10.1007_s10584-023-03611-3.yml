Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, specifically global temperature change based on representative
    concentration pathways (RCPs).
  4: Climate change impacts, including temperature increases, precipitation anomalies,
    and climate tipping points (permafrost melt, ice sheet disintegration, and Amazon
    die-back).
  5: Temperature and precipitation variation.
  8: The scenarios discuss challenges to adaptation and mitigation as socio-economic
    drivers influencing inequality, economic growth, and population changes.
  9: Climate change and changing temperature.
  10: Climate change is identified as the driver impacting poverty outcomes.
  11: Climate change impacts are evaluated under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
    (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).
  12: Surpassing tipping points and different RCP scenarios (Representative Concentration
    Pathways), which represent different levels of greenhouse gas concentrations and
    thus different levels of climate change.
  13: Climate change impacts on poverty levels are affected by different RCP scenarios
    and income inequality.
  14: Temperature change driven by climate change is identified as a driver of increased
    inequality, which in turn contributes to poverty.
  15: SSP2-RCP 4.5 climate change scenario
Evaluation overview:
  1: Future poverty, measured by the number of people living in poverty across income
    thresholds.
  4: The page discusses the impact of climate change on poverty and inequality, including
    economic growth and productivity.
  5: Income disparities, economic production, income distribution, and population
    change.
  8: The page provides projections of socioeconomic indicators such as GDP per capita,
    Gini index, and population demographics under different SSP scenarios.
  9: Global economic growth and global Gini coefficient (inequality).
  10: The paper evaluates the impact of climate change on global poverty levels, specifically
    extreme poverty, poverty, and moderate poverty.
  11: Provides an overview of the impact of climate change on poverty across different
    income thresholds ($1.90, $3.20, $5.50) for the years 2030, 2050, and 2070.
  12: Impacts on global GDP and poverty, specifically the climate-attributable loss
    in GDP and increase in the number of people in poverty due to climate change.
  13: The paper evaluates the impact of climate change on poverty levels globally.
  14: Economic growth, inequality, and poverty are evaluated in relation to climate
    change and technological development.
  15: Impact on extreme poverty
Highlights:
  1: Forecasts of climate-driven poverty increases in this paper are lower than estimates
    made using bottom-up approaches.
  4: Climate change exacerbates both within-country and between-country inequality.  Poorer,
    hotter countries will experience the largest reductions in growth, amplifying
    interstate inequality. Tipping points increase the social cost of carbon.
  5: Climate change exacerbates inequality, directly and indirectly, through agricultural
    activity; depressed agricultural yields directly affect rural income and likely
    affect poor urban populations indirectly by jeopardizing their real income and
    consumption patterns via increased food prices.
  8: High GDP growth in SSP5 with increasing income equality, while SSP3 and SSP4
    show high population growth with persistent inequality.
  9: Climate change is projected to reduce global economic growth and increase global
    inequality across all scenarios. The magnitude of the impact varies significantly
    depending on the scenario.
  10: Key outcomes include the projected increase in extreme poverty due to climate
    change, with the worst-case scenario showing 130 million additional people in
    poverty by 2070 under SSP3-RCP 6.0, and the most optimistic scenario showing as
    low as 4 million by 2070 under SSP1-RCP 2.6.
  11: By 2070, nearly 40% of the population living on less than $1.90 per day will
    be attributable to climate change under IFs-RCP 6.0 scenario. Including tipping
    points significantly increases poverty estimates.
  12: Climate change and surpassing tipping points are projected to have substantial
    negative impacts on global GDP and to increase poverty. The magnitude of these
    impacts varies considerably depending on the RCP scenario. Improving income inequality
    could offset some of the climate-attributable poverty increases.
  13: Human choices related to climate mitigation and income distribution improvement
    can significantly impact poverty reduction.
  14: The research aims to find a balance between socioeconomic development, technological
    development, and climate change.
  15: Climate change, under a middle-of-the-road scenario, is projected to push an
    additional 40 million people into extreme poverty by 2050.
Methodology:
  1: The International Futures (IFs) model is used to project poverty across income
    thresholds for 175 countries through 2070, combining RCPs with economic growth
    and inequality series from the SSPs.
  4: The analysis uses micro-simulations, damage functions (DICE, FUND, and PAGE),
    and models the impact of tipping points on the social cost of carbon.
  5: Uses SSPs, RCPs, and IFs to model economic production, income distribution, and
    population change for 175 countries from 2017 to 2070; introduces damage functions
    and tipping points to capture climate change impacts on economic activity; creates
    alternative socioeconomic development pathways for GDP and inequality that include
    or exclude climate effects.
  9: Uses IFs model with various SSP-RCP scenarios to project economic growth and
    inequality to 2030, 2050, and 2070.
  10: The analysis compares different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) and Representative
    Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios to estimate the impact of climate change
    on poverty levels, without using longitudinal error bands for uncertainty.
  11: Includes scenarios with and without climate tipping points to assess their impact
    on poverty levels.
  12: The IFs-RCP model is used to analyze the effect of RCP scenarios plus surpassing
    tipping points on global GDP and poverty. The analysis looks at results in 2030,
    2050, and 2070. The sensitivity of the model to changes in the Gini coefficient
    for income inequality was also tested.
  13: The analysis uses SSP-RCP combinations and macro-level relationships to assess
    future climate impacts on poverty.
  14: The analysis relies on modeling with damage functions, historical data on temperature
    and inequality, and a consumption-based measure of human development.
  15: The analysis uses the IFs (International Futures) software platform.
More Notes:
  1: The paper acknowledges a tension between fossil fuel-based economic development
    (which alleviates poverty) and its contribution to climate change.
  9: The economic impacts are presented in both cumulative trillions of 2011 US$ and
    percent changes.
  11: Considers the impact of potential catastrophic tipping points which can elevate
    poverty numbers.
  12: The study investigates the relationship between income inequality and climate-induced
    poverty by testing scenarios with exogenously reduced income inequality.  It also
    tests temperature change and income inequality relationships from other studies.
  14: The model does not explicitly address sectoral dynamics (e.g., agriculture),
    the relationship between energy/food prices and poverty, precipitation changes,
    or shocks from exceeding planetary boundaries. The analysis explores the roles
    of renewable energy (mitigating emissions) and productivity (exacerbating emissions)
    in influencing these dynamics.
  15: The paper acknowledges the uncertainty in future climate change effects and
    emphasizes the need for both mitigation and adaptation policies. It also highlights
    the need to balance socioeconomic development with environmental consequences.

Quantitative material:
  1: 'Climate change-attributable extreme poverty will grow to 25 million people by
    2030 (range: 18 to 30), 40 million by 2050 (range: 9 to 78), and 32 million by
    2070 (range: 4 to 130).'
  4: Mentions an increase of 122 million people living in extreme poverty by 2030
    (relative to a world without climate change) according to a World Bank study (SSP4-RCP
    8.5).  Also mentions that if all tipping points are surpassed, the social cost
    of carbon will increase by about 25% by 2100.
  5: "A 1% increase in temperature raises the Gini coefficient for income inequality\
    \ by 0.5 points on a 0\u2013100-point scale."
  8: Specific quantitative projections are provided, including GDP per capita reaching
    $97.4k in SSP5 by 2070 and population figures for SSP3 reaching 11.3 billion by
    2070.
  9: GDP reduction ranges from -0.2 to -0.6% by 2030, -0.8 to -1.5% by 2050, and -0.8
    to -3.2% by 2070. The increase in global inequality driven by temperature is projected
    to range from 0.01 to 0.016 in 2030, 0.022 to 0.042 in 2050, and 0.023 to 0.074
    in 2070.
  10: "Quantitative projections are provided showing the increase in the number of\
    \ people pushed into extreme poverty under various scenarios, e.g., 18\u201330\
    \ million additional by 2030, 78 million by 2050, and 130 million by 2070 in SSP3-RCP\
    \ 6.0 scenario."
  11: Quantitative estimates show millions of people pushed into poverty due to climate
    change, with detailed projections for different scenarios like SSP1-RCP 2.6 and
    SSP3-RCP 6.0 from 2030 to 2070.
  12: Table 5 provides the cumulative effect of tipping points on global GDP in trillions
    of 2011 US$ for the years 2030, 2050, and 2070 under various RCP scenarios (IFs-RCP
    6.0, SSP1-RCP 2.6, SSP2-RCP 4.5, SSP3-RCP 6.0, SSP4-RCP 6.0, and SSP5-RCP 8.5).  Figure
    5 shows the climate-attributable poverty in millions under the same RCPs. For
    example, under SSP5-RCP 8.5, the GDP loss in 2070 is -$2,340.0 trillion.
  13: In RCP 8.5, a fifteen percent reduction in income inequality would be necessary
    to manage poverty impacts.
  15: An additional 40 million people in extreme poverty by 2050 relative to a world
    without climate change, under the SSP2-RCP 4.5 scenario.
