Highlights:
  4: The most affected countries in relative economic terms would be Denmark, Albania,
    Greece, Estonia, and Finland. Germany, the Netherlands, and France would lose
    the largest share of their coastal ecosystem services. Salt marshes would experience
    the highest absolute losses, while beaches, sands, and dunes would experience
    the highest relative losses.
  6: Land erosion leads to a loss of ecosystem services with estimated monetary value;
    however, national-scale impacts are not presented.
  7: Presents the first pan-European analysis of ecosystem service loss due to SLR-induced
    coastal erosion.
  11: Ecosystem service valuation is a key area.
  15: Impacts are analyzed at national and regional scales. The influence on results
    of factors beyond coastal erosion (land use change, ecosystem valuation uncertainty,
    demographic growth) are analyzed.
  17: Wetlands services would make up more than 70% of losses, up to 30 billion euros,
    or almost a quarter of the 2018 value.
  18: Beaches, sands, and dunes are identified as the most endangered ecosystems in
    relative terms. Salt marshes face the biggest losses in absolute terms (14-17
    billion euros per annum by 2100). Agricultural areas associated with an intense
    mode of production are the least affected.
  20: Coastal ecosystem services vary substantially between countries. The United
    Kingdom, France, and Italy had the highest total value of coastal ecosystem services
    in 2018. Greece had the highest relative economic value in Europe (more than 18%
    of GDP). Denmark is projected to lose the most services relative to GDP, while
    France is projected to have the highest absolute losses.
  21: Some countries are projected to lose significant portions of their coastal ecosystem
    services as a percentage of GDP due to coastal erosion.
  22: Southeast coast of North Sea, Bay of Biscay, and eastern Mediterranean Sea are
    identified as areas with concentrated impacts. Danish, German, and French regions
    frequently appear on top in terms of absolute losses. Some Greek and Dutch regions
    are also projected to be heavily affected.

  51: "The total value of coastal ecosystem services in 2018 is estimated at \u20AC\
    494.1 billion. This table shows the projected percentage loss in value for different\
    \ types of ecosystem services by 2050 and 2100."
  52: The study quantifies the economic impact of losing coastal ecosystem services
    due to climate change by expressing the annual loss as a percentage of GDP.
  55: Coastal erosion could cause a loss of coastal ecosystem services up to a maximum
    estimate representing the 95th percentile of the erosion projection.
  61: Coastal ecosystem services can represent over 80% of GDP in some NUTS 3 regions.
    Coastal erosion is constrained by topographical and artificial barriers.
Methodology:
  1: The paper analyzes future losses of ecosystem services, implicitly linking environmental
    changes to potential economic consequences.
  4: Uses datasets derived from remote sensing products (CORINE Land Cover) and probabilistic
    coastal erosion projections constrained by artificial and topographical barriers.
    Historical changes (2000-2018) and projections under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for 2050
    and 2100 are included.
  6: Analysis uses Special Report on Energy Scenarios (SRES) climate change scenarios
    (now outdated) and deterministic projections of erosion spanning until the mid-21st
    century.
  7: Combines land cover data, coastal erosion projections, and ecosystem service
    valuations to project losses and relative economic impacts. Covers 33 countries
    and dependent territories, excluding Russia and Ukraine due to data limitations.
  9: The study uses CLC (Corine Land Cover) 2018 as the baseline land cover/use for
    future projections. Historical changes were identified through CLC-Changes for
    2000-2006, 2006-2012, and 2012-2018, due to the higher resolution of CLC-Changes.
    All CLC data were used in vector format (v20 dated May 1, 2019).
  11: Uses the Bruun rule, MERIT digital elevation model, and GEBCO dataset to estimate
    coastal erosion. Ecosystem service valuation uses integrated evidence from various
    case studies.
  15: Geospatial data processing was carried out using Python scripts executed in
    ArcGis software, while statistical analyses of the results were completed in MATLAB.
    Land cover transitions between 2000 and 2018 are investigated using CLC-Changes
    layers. Uncertainty of ecosystem valuation is based on ranges of estimates from
    other studies (de Groot et al., 2012).
  18: Median projections for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios are used for 2050 and 2100.
    90% confidence intervals are provided.
  20: Analyzing the loss as a percentage of 2018 services.

    405 would be affected by coastal erosion in at least one scenario.
  22: The analysis projects losses of ecosystem services for the year 2100 under best-case
    and worst-case scenarios.
  42: No relevant information
  51: The values for 2050 and 2100 are median projections and 90% confidence intervals
    are provided.

    barriers, analyzed at the level of transects.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on ecosystem services, which are indirectly related to macroeconomic
    and macro-fiscal outcomes. Further investigation is needed to determine the direct
    impact on GDP, budget balance, or other measures of interest.
  4: The study highlights the urgency of undertaking mitigation actions. The analysis
    is performed at the NUTS 3 regional level.
  6: The study covers merely 10 European countries.
  7: Study hypothesizes that coastal erosion will have uneven impacts on ecosystem
    services across Europe, but those impacts will be locally significant.
  9: The study focuses on land cover changes, particularly in coastal regions. Figure
    2 illustrates the countries and territories included in the study and their coastal
    regions. Supplementary Figure 1 presents the CLC inventory for an example coastal
    area in Germany, showing land loss due to erosion between 2012 and 2018.
  11: The text appears to use specific symbols instead of regular text which may have
    caused inaccurate extractions.
  15: Two regions of Ireland (mid-west and south-west) were merged due to lack of
    separate regional GDP estimates. National-level GDP was used for Bosnia and Herzegovina
    as the country has not implemented the NUTS classification. Results for Norway
    exclude ecosystem services and GDP from three regions where coastal erosion data
    were not available. Five small countries and territories were excluded from the
    economic analysis due to lack of GDP data.
  18: Water excludes the sea and ocean. The impacts of coastal erosion vary between
    different ecosystem services. The main benefits of the ecosystems are regulating.
  20: The importance of coastal ecosystem services is also high in Cyprus, Estonia,
    and Montenegro. Low importance was recorded in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgium,
    and Slovenia.
  21: The analysis includes projections for specific countries and regions regarding
    losses in ecosystem services due to coastal erosion. The impact is quantified
    in billions of euros and as a percentage of 2018 GDP.

    and coastal management, potentially relevant for understanding the broader context
    of climate change impacts and adaptation but without specific details on macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level, as requested.

Quantitative material:
  4: In 2018, coastal zone habitats generated 494 billion euros of services annually.
    Sea-level rise could erode 1.0% (0.7-1.5%) of the 2018 area under RCP4.5 and 1.2%
    (0.7-2.2%) under RCP8.5. The decline in services would be 4.2% (3.0-6.1%) under
    RCP4.5 and 5.1% (3.3-8.5%) under RCP8.5.
  6: 4500 km^2 of land eroded between 1975 and 2006; 3700-5800 km^2 projected until
    2050. Corresponds to a loss of 0.7 billion euros of annual ecosystem services
    (at 2000 prices) in 2006 compared with 1975, and 1.5-2.2 billion euros in 2050
    compared with 2006.
  7: Projects impacts for years 2050 and 2100 under two future emission scenarios
    (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5).
  15: GDP data in purchasing power parities from Eurostat (Eurostat, 2020a) at national
    (2018) and regional (NUTS 3) levels (2018 or latest available, adjusted to 2018
    price level) is used to analyze impacts. Population numbers from 1950 to 2100
    from United Nations (2019) are used for probabilistic population projections to
    compute additional results and highlight changes in demand on services.
  17: 'Decline in services would be greater: 4.2% (3.0-6.1%) under RCP4.5 and 5.1%
    (3.3-8.5%) under RCP8.5.'
  18: 'Table 2 provides historical (2000-2018) and projected (2050 and 2100) annual
    ecosystem services values for different land classes (Artificial surfaces, Agricultural
    areas, Forest and semi-natural areas, Wetlands, Water) in billions of 2018 euros.
    Example: Total ecosystem services value projected for 2100 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5
    is between 452.3 and 479.1 billion euros.'
  20: In 2018, the United Kingdom had the highest total in annual service with more
    than 59 billion euros, followed by France (54 billion euros) and Italy (50 billion
    euros). Services of Greece totalled 41 billion euros, accounting for more than
    18% of GDP. Denmark was projected to lose most services relative to GDP in all
    scenarios, reaching 1.2-1.6% (0.8-2.4%) by 2100. Losses of more than 0.3% of GDP
    per annum are also likely in Estonia and Finland, and possible in Norway, Latvia,
    Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Impacts would be almost negligible in Bosnia and
    Herzegovina, Belgium, Poland, and Malta (less than 0.02% of GDP). Highest absolute
    losses would occur in France (14-19% share in Europe), the United Kingdom (11-17%),
    Denmark (12-15%), and Germany (9-16%). Denmark is projected losses of 9-12% (7-19%)
    of coastal ecosystem services by 2100 followed closely by Germany.
  21: Figure 4 presents coastal ecosystem services per year based on CLC 2018, in
    billions of euros and as a percentage of 2018 GDP, by country. The Netherlands
    was projected to lose a considerable share of its relatively small amount of services
    (8-9% to 7-16%) by the end of the 21st century. France, Albania, Finland, and
    the United Kingdom could all lose more than 10% of their 2018 services under certain
    scenarios. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgium, Cyprus, Lithuania, and Montenegro
    would most likely lose no more than 1%.
  22: "Regions could lose ecosystem services equal to more than 5% of their regional\
    \ GDP in the best case, and more than 10% of 2018 services. Specific regions like\
    \ North Jutland (Denmark) and Nordfriesland (Germany) could lose about 2 billion\
    \ euros of services. Gjirokast\xEBr (Albania) could incur the highest relative\
    \ loss (41% of GDP in the most extreme case). Friesland (Germany) could see losses\
    \ in the range of 59-65%. Imathia (Greece) could suffer the highest loss among\
    \ European regions of 65% under the worst-case scenario."
