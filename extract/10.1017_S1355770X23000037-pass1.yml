Drivers of Risk:
  3: Long-term exposure to extreme temperatures
  10: Local heat exposure days; Local cold exposure days
  14: Long-term exposure to local extreme temperatures, both heat and cold, impacts
    depression symptoms in middle-aged and elderly people in China.
  15: Local heat exposure days and local cold exposure days.
  17: Extreme temperatures leading to increased vulnerability in elderly populations.
  19: Local extreme temperatures impact depression symptoms in rural populations.
  20: Extreme weather events and increasingly frequent temperature changes, especially
    their disproportionate impact on rural populations due to their dependence on
    vulnerable ecological systems and lower socioeconomic status.
  23: Long-term exposure to local extreme temperatures, particularly cold exposure;
    Temperature variation (regardless of direction).
  32: Temperature
  36: No relevant information
  37: Heat exposure days in summer; Cold exposure days in winter
  42: Heat and cold exposure days.
  45: Heat exposure days, cold exposure days, precipitation, wind speed, sunshine
    duration, relative humidity, air pressure, and PM2.5.
  47: No relevant information
Highlights:
  3: Long-term exposure to extreme temperatures increases depression levels in adults
    over 45, highlighting a social cost of climate change. Air conditioning and heating
    equipment can alleviate this adverse impact.
  10: No relevant information
  14: The impact of cold exposure on depression is nearly twice as significant as
    that of heat exposure.
  15: Households without AC have a much stronger depression reaction to hot exposure
    days than those with AC. Households without heating devices have a much stronger
    depression reaction to cold exposure days than those with heating devices.
  17: Elderly populations are significantly more vulnerable to heat and cold exposure,
    affecting both physical and mental health.
  19: Rural residents have a lower adaptive capacity to extreme temperatures compared
    to urban residents, emphasizing their vulnerability.
  20: The adverse impact of local extreme temperature on rural populations is more
    pronounced, and this effect is not significantly biased by migration behavior.
    The threshold of extreme temperature is likely greater than 0.7 SD to have an
    effect.
  23: Local temperature variation significantly worsens depression symptoms of individuals
    in China, particularly the elderly, women, and rural residents; AC and heating
    equipment appear to be protective.
  32: Temperature effects on mortality and household adaptation in China
  37: Increased heat exposure significantly increases CES-D scores, Somatic activity,
    and Depressed reaction among individuals without air conditioning. Increased cold
    exposure significantly increases CES-D scores and Depressed reaction among individuals
    without heating.
  39: Effects of cold and heat exposure are nonlinear, with different ranges of exposure
    days having different effects on the outcome variables. The presence of AC and
    heating modifies the impact of heat and cold exposure, respectively.
  42: Impact of heat and cold exposure days on CES-D score differs by age group (Age
    > 60 vs. Age <= 60).
  45: Both heat and cold exposure days have statistically significant positive effects
    on CES-D and somatic activity. PM2.5 has statistically significant positive effects
    on CES-D, somatic activity, and depressed reaction, and a negative effect on positive
    reaction. Sunshine duration has a statistically significant negative effect on
    positive reaction. Relative humidity and air pressure have some limited statistical
    significance on CES-D and somatic activity.
  46: Heat and cold exposure days have statistically significant effects on depression
    scores, and these effects vary across age groups, genders, and urban/rural locations.

Methodology:
  3: Analysis based on the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study and environmental
    data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from 2011 to
    2015, controlling for city, year, and individual fixed effects
  10: Uses daily average temperature data from China Meteorological Administration
    matched with individual data (CHARLS) to calculate number of local extreme temperature
    days (heat and cold exposure) based on deviations from historical monthly average
    temperatures (1980-2010). A deviation of more than 1.96 SD from the local monthly
    average temperature is defined as an extreme temperature day.
  14: Regression analysis is used, controlling for fixed effects at city, individual,
    and year levels to assess the impact of local extreme temperatures on depression
    symptoms.
  15: Subsample analysis of populations with and without AC/heating to estimate mitigation
    effects.
  20: The study uses a model which appears to include location fixed effects to analyze
    the impact of local extreme temperatures on rural populations, and conducts robustness
    checks using alternative temperature measures and by controlling for migration.
  23: Uses large-scale micro-household survey data and nationwide historical climate
    data in China; Panel data analysis leveraging the exogeneity of temperature variation.
  32: Empirical evidence from China
  36: The analysis uses fixed-effects models with county/community-clustered standard
    errors. The data source is CHARLS 2011, 2013, and 2015 survey data. The models
    include control variables, individual-, year-, and city- fixed effects.
  37: Fixed effects models using CHARLS survey data from 2011, 2013, and 2015. Models
    include control variables, individual, year, and city fixed effects. Standard
    errors are clustered at the county/community level.
  39: Regression analysis with nonlinear temperature indicators (binned temperature
    variables), quadratic terms, and interaction terms with AC and heating to assess
    the impact of cold and heat exposure.
  42: Regression analysis with county/community-level clustered standard errors, control
    variables, and individual-, year-, and city- fixed effects, using CHARLS 2011,
    2013, 2015 survey data.
  45: The analysis uses fixed-effects models with city-specific linear trends, controlling
    for individual, year, and city-fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at
    the county/community level. The data is sourced from CHARLS 2011, 2013, and 2015
    survey data.
  46: Fixed effects models are used, including control variables and individual-,
    year-, and city-fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the county/community
    level. The data source is the CHARLS 2011, 2013, 2015 Survey Data.
  47: Interview visit month in CHARLS
  49: The analysis seems to involve examining extreme heat and cold exposures in 2011
    using CHARLS data.
More Notes:
  3: The study defines extreme temperature exposure in relative terms based on local
    temperature patterns.
  10: The analysis uses data from 2010, 2012, and 2014. The definition of extreme
    temperature is relative to local historical precedents.
  15: The paper focuses on the impact of temperature exposure on individual's somatic
    activities and depression reactions, rather than macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
    The adaptation mechanisms considered are AC and heating.
  17: The interaction between climate change effects and elderly vulnerabilities poses
    challenges to population health and environmental justice.
  19: The mental health of the rural population is significant for China's productivity
    and provision of natural resources.
  20: The paper primarily focuses on the impact of extreme temperatures on rural populations
    in China, and the page does not provide direct quantitative information on national-level
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, or the costs and benefits of national
    adaptation strategies.
  23: The paper focuses on mental health outcomes, specifically depression symptoms
    and somatic activities, rather than direct macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  32: This paper investigates the impact of temperature on mortality and how households
    adapt to these temperature effects, using evidence from China. This is relevant
    to the macro-fiscal risks of climate change, especially regarding health expenditures
    and potential labor productivity losses.
  36: The specific outcome variables associated with the regression results are not
    described on this page. The abbreviation CHARLS is not defined.
  37: The outcome variables are individual-level measures of psychological and physical
    well-being, not macroeconomic or macro-fiscal variables. The table explores the
    effectiveness of adaptation mechanisms (air conditioning and heating) in mitigating
    the impacts of extreme temperatures on these outcomes.
  42: The CES-D score is not a macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcome, so the information
    is not directly applicable to a review of macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks
    of climate change and the costs and benefits of adaptation at a national level.
  45: The outcome variables measure individual-level mental health, not macroeconomic
    or fiscal variables.
  46: The dependent variable is 'depression scores', which is not directly a macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal outcome, but may affect overall economic activity.
  47: The figure title suggests the data is related to the China Health and Retirement
    Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The number 45 is on the same line as the title. It
    may be a sample size, figure number, page number, or a constant.
  49: The figures are specifically referencing the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal
    Study (CHARLS) from 2011, suggesting a focus on China's population and potentially
    its older demographic. The page number is 47.

    'depression scores' across different demographic groups. For example, an additional
    heat exposure day is associated with a 0.0070 increase in depression scores for
    individuals over 60 (significant at the 10% level), while an additional cold exposure
    day is associated with a 0.0127 increase in depression scores for individuals
    over 60 (significant at the 1% level).
