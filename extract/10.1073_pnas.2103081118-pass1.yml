Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate tipping points like thawing permafrost, ice sheet disintegration, and
    changes in atmospheric circulation; greenhouse gas emissions
  2: Tipping points in the climate system including positive carbon-cycle and temperature
    feedbacks, ice sheet disintegration, and changes in large-scale circulation.
  3: Climate tipping points (TPs) such as permafrost carbon feedback, ocean methane
    hydrates, slowdown of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), and
    weakening of Subpolar Atlantic Feedback (SAF)
  4: Climate tipping points, temperature impacts on productivity and growth, sea level
    rise (SLR)
  5: Tipping points (disintegration of GIS and WAIS, permafrost carbon feedback, dissociation
    of ocean methane hydrates, weakening SAF, AMOC slowdown), Temperature increases,
    Sea Level Rise (SLR), Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
  6: Climate tipping points, additional warming, sea level rise.
  7: Climate tipping points such as AMOC slowdown and SAF weakening impact macroeconomic
    outcomes.
  8: Tipping points (permafrost carbon feedback, dissociation of ocean methane hydrates,
    Arctic sea ice loss, dieback of the Amazon rainforest, disintegration of the GIS
    and WAIS), slowdown of the AMOC, variability of the Indian summer monsoon.
Highlights:
  1: Climate tipping points increase global economic risk and increase economic losses
    almost everywhere; dissociation of ocean methane hydrates and thawing permafrost
    have the largest effects.
  2: Tipping points significantly increase the expected SCC, with ocean methane hydrates
    and permafrost carbon feedback contributing the most. The distribution of expected
    increases in the SCC is positively skewed.
  3: Tipping points collectively increase the expected SCC by 24.5%. Interactions
    between tipping points involve offsetting positive and negative effects. Some
    tipping points (AMOC slowdown, SAF weakening) can decrease the SCC.
  4: Climate tipping points increase the SCC and the risk borne by the world economy;
    tipping points increase inequality in climate impacts; tipping points reduce global
    mean consumption per capita; impacts of climate change are regressive (higher
    SCC in poorer countries).
  5: Tipping points generally increase damages associated with climate change. Country-level
    SCC estimates vary significantly, and the percentage change in SCC due to tipping
    points also varies substantially across countries.
  6: Climate tipping points lead to additional warming, sea level rise, and changes
    in global surface food calorie access, all of which can be modeled.
  7: Climate tipping points increase the overall level of risk in the global economy,
    elevating the expected SCC due to risk aversion.
  8: Slowdown of the AMOC modulates the relationship between global mean surface temperature
    and national mean surface temperature. Variability of the Indian summer monsoon
    directly affects GDP per capita in India.
Methodology:
  1: Uses a meta-analytic integrated assessment model (IAM) with a modular structure
    that includes national-level climate damages for 180 countries, calibrated on
    detailed econometric evidence and simulation modeling; performs a structural meta-analysis.
  2: Developed a 'meta-analytic IAM' that includes replicas of each tipping point
    module in the literature and integrates them into one consistent framework. Monte
    Carlo simulation with a sample size of 10,000.
  3: The expected SCC is computed over 10,000 Monte Carlo draws. The model explores
    the impact of climate damages impacting the level of economic activity or its
    growth rate using a flexible specification parameterizing the weight given to
    exogenous socioeconomic scenarios vs. actual post-damage income.
  4: Meta-analytic integrated assessment model (IAM) analysis with country-level resolution,
    Monte Carlo simulations (pooled sample size of 32,000 for SCC uncertainty, 10,000
    for consumption distributions), calculation of Gini coefficient and correlation
    between GDP per capita and SCCs.
  5: Monte Carlo simulation with a sample size of 10,000 and 0.1% trimmed. Uses RCP4.5-SSP2
    emissions and GDP/population growth. Employs Hope and Schaefer PCF, Whiteman et
    al. beta OMH, and IPSL AMOC hosing. The SCC is calculated by converting consumption
    losses into utility losses and then taking the discounted sum from 2020 until
    the end of the modeling horizon.
  6: Monte Carlo simulations are used under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios.
    Data is sampled on a decadal interval (2020, 2030,...2200).
  7: The paper uses a meta-analytic integrated assessment model (IAM) with inputs
    from Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)/Shared Socio-Economic Pathway
    (SSP) scenarios, simulates warming using a two-box model, and includes tipping
    point modules.
  8: The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is estimated by running the model twice, the
    second time with an additional pulse of emissions in the year 2020. The SCC is
    the scaled difference in welfare between the two runs per ton of CO2 emissions.
More Notes:
  1: The authors present a reduced-form tipping points damage function that could
    be incorporated in other IAMs; numbers are probable underestimates.
  2: The authors believe that the 24.5% increase in SCC due to tipping points should
    be seen as an underestimate. The model disaggregates damages to the national level
    using empirical and simulation results on the impacts of temperature and SLR.
  3: The effect of including global nonmarket damages from climate change using the
    MERGE IAM increases the expected SCC marginally to 26.9%. The impact of different
    tipping points varies significantly, with ocean methane hydrates causing a large
    increase (13.1%) and SAF weakening decreasing the SCC (-1.7%). High risk aversion
    (elasticity of marginal utility of consumption set to 2) leads to a larger increase
    in the SCC due to tipping points, but this result is driven by a small number
    of runs in the right tail of the distribution. The model also incorporates uncertainty
    regarding the structure of climate damages, exploring scenarios where damages
    affect the level or growth rate of income.
  4: The analysis considers different interpretations of how temperature affects the
    economy (affecting either production/productivity levels or growth rates). Uncertainty
    regarding tipping points and their impacts dominates the range of estimated SCCs.
    The inclusion of SLR increases relative costs in some countries.
  5: Country-level impacts of tipping points depend on factors like latitude, optimum
    temperature, and coastal population size. AMOC slowdown benefits Europe, while
    parts of central Asia see increased climate damages.
  6: The paper synthesizes existing literature and aims to provide a more quantitative
    understanding of the economic impacts of climate tipping points, encouraging their
    better reflection in climate policy advice.
  8: There are eight tipping modules replicating underlying studies listed in Table
    1 (not present in this page).
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) increase, Global GDP effects, National-level climate
    damages from rising temperatures and sea levels
  2: Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) - the economic cost of emitting one additional ton
    of CO2.
  3: Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)
  4: National Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), global mean consumption per capita, income
    inequality (measured by Gini coefficient)
  5: Welfare losses (measured as consumption losses), Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)
  6: Change in world consumption per capita due to tipping points, relative to world
    consumption per capita without climate damages is an outcome of interest, as shown
    in the bottom scatterplot (though not macroeconomic at a national level).
  7: Climate tipping points increase economic costs almost everywhere, but these additional
    costs do not significantly affect inequality.
  8: GDP per capita, welfare
Quantitative material:
  1: Climate tipping points increase the social cost of carbon (SCC) by ~25%; there
    is an ~10% chance of climate tipping points more than doubling the SCC.
  2: 'Combining all eight tipping points increases the expected SCC by 24.5%. Individual
    tipping points: Ocean methane hydrates (+13.1%), permafrost carbon feedback (+8.4%),
    disintegration of the WAIS (+2.9%), disintegration of the GIS (+1.8%), Indian
    summer monsoon variability (+1.3%), Amazon dieback (+0.1%), slowdown of the AMOC
    (-1.4%), Surface Albedo Feedback (SAF) (-1.7%).'
  3: The expected SCC under no tipping points is $52.03/tCO2. Inclusion of all tipping
    points increases the expected SCC to $64.80/tCO2, a 24.5% increase.
  4: SCC increases by 42.8% due to climate tipping points (95% CI of -0.3 to +186.0%);
    Gini coefficient of national SCCs is 0.64 with tipping points vs. 0.66 without;
    correlation between national GDP per capita and SCCs is -0.326 without tipping
    points and -0.335 with; tipping points increase the coefficient of variation of
    global mean consumption per capita by 79% in 2050 and 34% in 2100; expected increase
    in SCC due to tipping points is relatively robust to variations in the temperature
    impacts on productivity.
  5: "Tipping points reduce global consumption per capita by around 1% upon 3\xB0\
    C warming and by around 1.4% upon 6\xB0C warming, based on a second-order polynomial\
    \ fit of the data. In some runs, damages exceed 4%. A linear fit of the data implies\
    \ 61% more SLR at any given level. 2\xB0C warming in the absence of tipping points\
    \ corresponds to 2.3\xB0C warming in the presence of tipping points."
  6: "The equations for the trend lines in each of the scatterplots provide quantitative\
    \ relationships between the changes in the x and y axes: Additional GMST change\
    \ given all tipping points (\xB0C) = 0.23x + 0.03x^2; Additional SLR (max tipping\
    \ points) (m) = 0.01x; Additional change with maxi. tipp (access) = 0.41x - 0.04x^2"
  7: There is a premium on the expected Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) under high risk
    aversion.
  8: The elasticity of marginal utility of consumption is triangular distributed with
    a minimum of 0.5, mode of 1.5, and maximum of 2. The pure rate of time preference
    is triangular distributed with a minimum of 0.1%, mode of 1%, and maximum of 2%.
    Each SCC run involves a Monte Carlo simulation with a sample size of 10,000.
