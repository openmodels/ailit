Drivers of Risk:
  1: Thawing permafrost, ice sheet disintegration, changes in atmospheric circulation,
    dissociation of ocean methane hydrates.
  3: Climate tipping points, pure rate of time preference, elasticity of marginal
    utility of consumption, albedo forcing changes due to shrinking ice and snow cover
  4: Climate tipping points (e.g., AMOC hosing) and temperature increases are key
    drivers. The specific tipping points are explored in SI Appendix, section 3.3.
  5: Key drivers include tipping points such as the disintegration of glaciers, permafrost
    carbon feedback, dissociation of ocean methane hydrates, weakening of the stratified
    Arctic front, and slow down of AMOC.
  6: Global mean surface temperature (GMST) change, sea level rise (SLR), and economic
    damages related to tipping points.
  7: Greenhouse gas emissions, climate tipping points (AMOC slowdown, SAF weakening,
    permafrost carbon feedback, Indian summer monsoon variability, SLR, GIS and WAIS
    disintegration), global mean surface temperature, and sea level rise are identified
    as drivers of risk.
  8: Tipping points like permafrost carbon feedback, dissociation of ocean methane
    hydrates, Arctic sea ice loss, dieback of the Amazon rainforest, and disintegration
    of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets (GIS and WAIS).

    cost of carbon (SCC).
  3: Evaluates the social cost of carbon (SCC) with and without climate tipping points.
  4: Evaluates the impact of climate tipping points on the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC),
    global mean consumption per capita, and income inequality.

    cost of carbon (SCC) for various countries.
  6: Examines the economic impacts of climate tipping points, specifically the change
    in world consumption per capita due to tipping points relative to a scenario without
    climate damages.
  7: Economic costs and the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) are evaluated, considering
    climate tipping points.
  8: The study evaluates the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC).
  9: Economic impacts of tipping points in the climate system
Highlights:
  1: Climate tipping points increase global economic risk and increase economic losses
    almost everywhere. The tipping points with the largest effects are dissociation
    of ocean methane hydrates and thawing permafrost.
  3: Tipping points generally increase the expected SCC, though some (AMOC, SAF) can
    decrease it. Interactions between tipping points can offset each other. High risk
    aversion can disproportionately increase the expected SCC. The effect of permafrost
    carbon feedback is similar across different studies. AMOC slowdown generally decreases
    the SCC.
  4: Climate tipping points increase the SCC and future consumption risk. They disproportionately
    affect poorer regions, exacerbating income inequality, but the increase in inequality
    is relatively small. Pure growth damage assumptions significantly increase both
    the SCC and the impact of tipping points.
  5: Tipping points increase temperature response to GHG emissions, leading to higher
    SCC, with significant regional impacts, particularly in low-lying coastal areas
    and high-latitude regions.
  6: Tipping points impact GMST, SLR, and economic damages, with varying degrees of
    correlation. Additional SLR shows a strong linear correlation (y = 0.61x).
  7: Climate tipping points increase the overall level of risk in the global economy
    and increase economic costs almost everywhere. Tipping points do not have a significant
    effect on inequality. A straightforward way of augmenting the damage function
    in IAMs is provided.
  8: The paper incorporates eight tipping point modules into the model.
Methodology:
  1: Meta-analytic integrated assessment model (IAM) with a modular structure, including
    national-level climate damages from rising temperatures and sea levels for 180
    countries, calibrated on detailed econometric evidence and simulation modeling.
  3: Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 draws) with 0.1% trimmed.  RCP4.5-SSP2 emissions
    and GDP/population growth scenarios are used. They adopt a flexible specification
    of climate damages that can capture impacts on the level of economic activity
    or its growth rate.
  4: "Uses a meta-analytic IAM (integrated assessment model) to estimate national\
    \ SCCs and analyze the impact of tipping points. Analyzes different damage functions\
    \ by varying the parameter \u03D5, which determines the portion of impact felt\
    \ as level damages versus growth damages. Monte Carlo simulations are used to\
    \ generate distributions of outcomes under various scenarios."
  5: The analysis uses Monte Carlo sampling with 10,000 iterations and considers RCP4.5-SSP2
    emissions, GDP/population growth, and various climate models to assess SCC impacts
    by country.
  6: Uses 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios,
    sampled on a decadal interval (2020-2200). Applies nonlinear fits for temperature
    and damages and a linear fit for SLR. Specification comprises Hope and Schaefer
    PCF, Whiteman et al. beta OMH, and IPSL AMOC hosing.
  7: 'A meta-analytic IAM is used with components including: Anthropogenic Greenhouse
    Gas Emissions, Growth, and Population Projections; Atmospheric Chemistry and Warming
    (using the FAIR model); Country-Level Temperature Damages; Country-Level Damages
    from SLR; Flood and Drought Due to the Indian Summer Monsoon; Levels vs. Growth
    Damages; and Consumption and Welfare.'
  8: The SCC is estimated by running the model twice, once with a pulse of emissions
    in 2020. The SCC is the scaled difference in welfare between the two runs per
    ton of CO2 emissions. Each run involves a Monte Carlo simulation with a sample
    size of 10,000.
  9: The context implies a modeling and literature review approach related to economic
    impacts of climate tipping points.
More Notes:
  1: The authors note that their numbers are likely underestimates.
  3: The paper explores the effect of parametric uncertainty relating to the structure
    of climate damages on how tipping points increase the SCC. Includes a discussion
    of how different interpretations of climate damages (impacting the level vs. the
    growth rate of economic activity) can affect the results.
  4: The study explores the uncertainty surrounding the impact of tipping points by
    varying model parameters and scenarios. SI Appendix contains additional details
    on the methodology and results, including visualizations of Lorenz curves and
    the effect of individual tipping points on national SCCs.
  5: Tipping points can increase sea level rise by 61% at any temperature level; damages
    from tipping points can exceed 4% in some model runs.
  6: The analysis synthesizes fragmented literature to develop a more quantitative
    understanding of the economic impacts of climate tipping points.
  7: The research acknowledges limitations including incomplete coverage of climate
    tipping points and interactions, potential missing climate impacts, and uncertainties
    in tipping point modules and the IAM.
  8: The paper uses World Bank data on savings rates from 2005 to 2015.
Quantitative material:
  1: Climate tipping points increase the social cost of carbon (SCC) by ~25% in our
    main specification. An ~10% chance of climate tipping points more than doubling
    the SCC.
  3: 'Expected SCC values (US$/tCO2) with and without various tipping points (e.g.,
    None: 52.03, Permafrost carbon: 56.41, All TPs: 64.80); Percentage change in SCC
    due to individual and combined tipping points (e.g., Permafrost carbon: 8.4%,
    Ocean methane hydrates: 13.1%, All TPs: 24.5%).'
  4: Expected increase in SCC due to climate tipping points is 42.8% (95% CI of -0.3
    to +186.0%). Gini coefficient of national SCCs is 0.64 with tipping points, compared
    to 0.66 without. Population-weighted correlation between national GDP per capita
    and national SCCs is -0.326 without tipping points and -0.335 with. In a scenario
    of pure growth damages, tipping points increase the expected SCC by 87.0%. Tipping
    points increase the coefficient of variation in global mean consumption per capita
    by 79% in 2050 and 34% in 2100.
  5: "Quantitative estimates include additional warming due to tipping points (e.g.,\
    \ 2\xB0C warming could become 2.3\xB0C) and global consumption losses (e.g., 1%\
    \ upon 3\xB0C warming, and 1.4% upon 6\xB0C warming)."
  6: Presents equations for additional warming (y = 0.23x + 0.03x^2), additional SLR
    (y = 0.61x), and additional damages (y = 0.41x - 0.04x^2) due to tipping points,
    where 'x' represents the respective variable without tipping points.
  7: The paper provides a method of augmenting the damage function in Integrated Assessment
    Models (IAMs).
  8: Elasticity of marginal utility of consumption is triangularly distributed with
    a minimum of 0.5, mode of 1.5, and maximum of 2. Pure rate of time preference
    is triangularly distributed with a minimum of 0.1%, mode of 1%, and maximum of
    2%.
