  10: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  8: The model incorporates an increase in demand for marine commodities, market equilibrium,
    environmental (production) fluctuations, and adaptive management of fish stocks.
Highlights:
  8: The simulation shows that a constant high catch can appear sustainable in the
    short term due to the development of new fisheries, despite underlying stock collapses.
    A globally connected economic system allows consumer demand to shift between fisheries,
    masking declines in individual stocks.
Methodology:
  8: A 150-year simulation of global fisheries is conducted, modelling the interaction
    of demand, market equilibrium, environmental factors, and adaptive management
    strategies.
More Notes:
  8: The paper suggests that the collapse of individual fisheries puts additional
    pressure on other stocks through market mechanisms, and that negative climatic
    signals can trigger stock collapses, even when MSY catch limits have not been
    exceeded.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  8: The simulation analyzes the economic outcomes of fisheries management, particularly
    related to catch, price, and profitability, though not directly at a national
    macroeconomic or fiscal level.
Quantitative material:
  8: The graphs provide quantitative data on price as a function of production cost,
    fishing effort relative to maximum sustainable catches, regional fisheries catch
    relative to MSY, and available biomass in relation to pristine levels.
