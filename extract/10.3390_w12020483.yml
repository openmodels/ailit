Drivers of Risk:
  1: Flood events, climate change.
  2: Failure of flood protection infrastructure during moderate to extreme floods;
    Disruption in hydraulic connection between river and floodplain due to embankments;
    Traditional flood control methods focused solely on technical and economic viability,
    neglecting hydromorphological features and socio-economic conditions.
  4: Environmental factors such as loss of soil fertility, waterlogging, and negative
    impact on capture fisheries, as well as social factors like displacement of poorer
    households.
  7: Embankments (pre vs. post embankment periods).
  8: Increased discrimination in 1996 due to socio-economic variables.
  11: Flooding (average annual flood, moderate to extreme floods, 30-year flood, 100-year
    flood). Waterlogging induced by rainfall.
  12: Hydro-climatic events (floods), embankment construction (as a form of adaptation).
  13: Flooding (as indicated by inundated areas in 1988 and 1998), changes in high
    tide, and the presence/absence of embankments (implied through discussion of pre-embankment
    baseline).
  14: Floods, potentially influenced by climate change.
Highlights:
  1: Flood protection infrastructure in Bangladesh does not show higher benefits accruing
    to those living with higher levels of protection.
  2: Adaptation measures can have both beneficial and unintended detrimental consequences;
    Integration of adaptation actions and policies across sectors remains a key challenge;
    There is a paradigm shift to integrated flood management, covering issues relevant
    to flood, drainage, irrigation, navigation, environment and socio-economic development.
  4: Higher agricultural yields and economic prosperity for some farmers but negative
    impacts such as displacement, lower fish catch, and welfare differences that were
    inconclusive.
  7: The paper focuses on statistically comparing events data pre- and post-embankment
    using a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian statistical significance test and using
    ROC curves to classify inside/outside embankment
  8: Agricultural land ownership is the most discriminative variable across all four
    years studied. Land ownership is identified as the most important discriminative
    indicator.
  11: The embankment successfully withstood floods during subsequent years [after
    repairs post 1988 flood], but frequently suffered many problems. The embankment
    was able to protect the project area from inundation [during the 1998 flood].
    Some areas inside the embankment are subject to waterlogging induced by rainfall.
  12: Embankment construction is associated with a statistically significant change
    in internal movement rates (p < 0.01). Figures indicate trends over time, and
    can show differences in in-migration and mortality, inside versus outside the
    embankment.
  13: Highlights the challenges of evaluating long-term impacts due to data limitations
    and inconsistencies. Indicates a relationship between inward/outward population
    movement and embankment construction.
  14: Embankments have immediate impacts, but these impacts on some well-being indicators
    may even out over three decades; machine learning approaches can identify relevant
    indicators to evaluate the impacts of interventions.
Methodology:
  1: Machine learning to discriminate between households living inside vs. outside
    flood protection embankments using socio-economic survey and event data (death,
    migration) from 1983-2014 in Bangladesh.
  2: Proposes rigorous analytical methods to evaluate the impacts of adaptation measures
  4: Analysis uses historical data from a Health and Demographic Surveillance System
    (HDSS) managed by icddr,b with a focus on empirical studies and socio-economic
    surveys conducted at different times, including 1992 and 1996.
  7: Gaussian Process-based Bayesian statistical significance test to compare event
    rates pre- vs. post-embankment, Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve
    based on k-fold (k=3) cross-validation is used to evaluate inside/outside embankment
    classification
  8: ROC comparison, statistical significance tests to analyze socio-economic survey
    data; classification models to identify informative variables.
  11: Analysis of inward/outward migration rates, in-migration rates, and mortality
    rates inside vs. outside an embankment structure using available data. Normalized
    Difference Water Index (NDWI) analysis using LANDSAT imagery to delineate inundated
    areas in flood years.
  12: Generalized Pareto (GP)-based analysis of event rates pre- and post-embankment
    (1983-2014). Chi-squared tests are used to compare event rates.
  13: Uses LANDSAT 4-5 TM images and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to delineate
    inundated areas in flood years. Also uses data from WARPO for land elevation maps.
  14: Machine learning approaches to integrate socio-economic data with other data
    (hydro-climatic, water infrastructure, etc.); spatio-temporal analysis; analysis
    of variance; predictive modeling.
More Notes:
  1: Data gaps and spatial heterogeneity in sampled populations suggest caution in
    any conclusive interpretation of the flood protection infrastructure.
  2: Bangladesh has shifted from flood control (embankments) to integrated flood management
    (structural and non-structural measures); Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 emphasizes
    restoration, redesign, and maintenance of existing embankments.
  4: The embankment caused negative distributional outcomes, with wealthier landowners
    benefitting while poorer traditional fishermen and river transport workers were
    negatively impacted.
  7: The study uses socio-economic survey data to predict whether households live
    inside or outside embankments and analyzes changes in event rates related to this
    classification over time.
  8: The paper suggests the need for more data on agricultural productivity and markets
    to further investigate the differential impact over time. Some differences in
    socio-economic variables are a consequence of proximity to significant infrastructure
    (hospital, gasline, pipeline, deeptubewells) instead of direct consequence of
    living inside/outside embankment.
  11: "The study area is the Meghna\u2013Dhonagoda project area within Matlab North,\
    \ where 47% of the land is low lying. There are two pumping stations inside the\
    \ project area to drain out accumulated rainwater."
  12: The analysis explores the relationship between hydro-climatic events and socio-economic
    behavior, focusing on the impact of embankments.
  13: Acknowledges that other infrastructures (health, roads, electricity, education,
    etc.) have impacts in relation to the embankment. Data are limited to one-third
    of the study area. Emphasizes caution in interpreting classification results due
    to lack of common indicators across different years.
  14: The study focuses on the impacts of embankments in Bangladesh, but the proposed
    approaches are applicable to evaluate the environmental and socio-economic impacts
    of human interventions in general beyond the context of Bangladesh; The analysis
    provides a framework for evaluating both short-term and long-term as well as intended
    and unintended consequences of interventions.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Welfare of people, migration, mortality indicators, inward/outward movement with
    respect to embankment.
  2: Economic activities increased in areas protected by flood protection, leading
    to increased agricultural output; Flood protection failure led to higher damage
    compared to areas outside embankments due to accelerated economic activities;
    Hydraulic connection disruption led to damage to fisheries and local boat transport,
    compromising livelihoods.
  4: The embankment resulted in a net welfare loss due to higher than anticipated
    construction costs, lower benefits to agriculture over time, higher waterlogging
    damages, and negative impact on capture fisheries.
  7: Not explicitly macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, but differences in event rates
    related to living inside/outside embankments.
  8: No relevant information
  11: No relevant information
  12: Mortality rates, internal movement rates, and in-migration rates.
  13: Implicitly suggests impacts on agricultural yields, fishing, and other water-dependent
    economic activities, though without quantification. Suggests that social development
    is tied to the infrastructure.
  14: Well-being indicators, migration patterns, agricultural land ownership, water-borne
    disease morbidity, malnutrition rates in children, fishing and farming productivity,
    loan amounts and types.
Quantitative material:
  1: No significant difference between inside/outside populations based on welfare,
    migration, or mortality indicators. Significant difference in inward/outward movement
    with respect to the embankment.
