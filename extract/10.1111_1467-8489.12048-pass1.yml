Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, agricultural productivity growth, population growth, biofuel
    demand, income growth
  4: Changes in average per capita dietary energy intake, influenced by factors impacting
    food availability and access.
  5: Population changes, per capita income changes, and total factor productivity
    (TFP) growth in the crop, livestock, and processed food sectors.
  6: Demand only, Climate change (No CO2 fert., CO2 fert.)
  8: Population, per capita incomes, bioenergy policies, agricultural productivity,
    climate change, stagnation in agricultural productivity, CO2 fertilization
  10: Changes in dietary energy consumption, agricultural productivity growth relative
    to population and income growth.
  11: Stagnant agricultural productivity, income growth (demand-side drivers), higher
    food prices.
  12: Crop yield impacts of climate change (temperature and precipitation changes);
    CO2 fertilization effects.
  13: Climate change, CO2 fertilization effects, per capita incomes, biofuel use,
    TFP (Total Factor Productivity), and population growth are identified as drivers
    of risk.
  14: Population growth, increased biofuel use, climate change yield effects
  15: Population growth, income growth, biofuel use, climate change, and total factor
    productivity (TFP).
  16: Population, TFP, per capita income, biofuels, climate change
Highlights:
  1: Agricultural productivity growth is crucial for food security improvements. Climate
    change impacts on crop yields add uncertainty to projections.
  4: The paper focuses on both the prevalence (incidence) and the intensity (gap)
    of undernourishment, arguing that the malnutrition gap provides a more nuanced
    understanding of food deprivation than incidence alone.
  5: The SIMPLE model broadly replicates historical changes in average dietary intake,
    malnutrition incidence and gap at the global level.
  6: Climate change is projected to impact food security indicators such as dietary
    energy consumption and malnutrition, with regional variations and sensitivities
    to CO2 fertilization effects.
  8: Highlights the growing importance of per capita income as a key driver of food
    demand, especially in developing regions. Notes great uncertainty in the future
    of agricultural productivity, particularly in the crop sector.
  10: Under the baseline scenario, food prices in all regions are declining in 2050.
    Globally, the volume of food consumption increases by about 31 per cent, driven
    by increased consumption of livestock products and processed foods. There is a
    reduction in malnutrition as average dietary energy intake rises.
  11: Improvements in nutritional outcomes are severely dampened if agricultural productivity
    stagnates; Rising food prices are detrimental to food consumption in developing
    regions; The malnutrition headcount in sub-Saharan Africa rises significantly
    under stagnant productivity; Food security in sub-Saharan Africa is particularly
    vulnerable to setbacks in agricultural productivity growth due to high population
    growth.
  12: Climate change adversely affects crop yields and food security, particularly
    without CO2 fertilization; CO2 fertilization can partially offset yield losses
    and improve food security outcomes; Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia are particularly
    vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change on food security.
  13: Climate change could have significant implications on the nutritional outcomes
    of millions of people, particularly those living in hunger-stricken regions. The
    strength of the yield impacts of CO2 fertilization is uncertain. Lower income
    regions are more responsive to changes in food prices.
  14: TFP growth and per capita income growth are the main drivers for reduction in
    global malnutrition headcount. Population growth is a key driver of malnutrition
    in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and South East Asia.
  15: Population growth is the largest driver of global malnutrition, followed by
    climate change. Climate change could still pose significant risks on food security
    in the poorest regions.
  16: Future nutritional outcomes will be mainly affected by socio-economic conditions
    and productivity trends in the agricultural sector; Climate change will be a relevant
    driver of nutritional outcomes especially in regions with prevalent chronic malnutrition;
    Average dietary energy consumption changes under climate change are negligible,
    while changes in malnutrition prevalence and headcount are substantial.
Methodology:
  1: Partial equilibrium model of global agriculture incorporating a food security
    module, historical validation, future scenario implementation.
  4: The methodology relies on the concept of poverty-growth elasticities, adapted
    to the case of dietary energy. It assumes a lognormal distribution of per capita
    dietary energy consumption, consistent with FAO's traditional assumption. It uses
    food security data published by FAO.
  5: The study uses an economic model (SIMPLE) to project nutritional outcomes. The
    model is validated against historical data (1991-2001) by implementing shocks
    in population, per capita incomes, and total factor productivity (TFP) growth
    and comparing the simulated changes with actual changes from FAO data.
  6: Authors' calculations (likely model-based, but not explicitly stated what kind
    of model). Projections are for 2050.
  8: Uses a model (SIMPLE) to assess how global food security will be affected by
    various drivers. Scenarios are designed and implemented to project future outcomes.
    TFP growth is used to capture productivity improvements.
  10: The reduction in malnutrition incidence is determined by the difference between
    the areas bounded by the minimum dietary energy requirement and the caloric distribution
    curves in 2006 and in 2050. The analysis involves calculating probability densities
    of dietary energy consumption and projecting food consumption and prices to 2050.
  11: Compares a baseline scenario with a 'Demand only' scenario (ignoring supply-side
    drivers) to isolate the impact of agricultural productivity growth on nutritional
    attainment in 2050.
  12: "Uses yield estimates from M \u20ACuller et al. (2010) to model nutritional\
    \ outcomes in 2050 under climate change scenarios with and without CO2 fertilization."
  13: The study simulates changes in malnutrition count for the historical period
    1991-2001 and for a 'Climate Change no CO2 fert.' scenario. It evaluates the contribution
    of exogenous drivers to these changes.
  14: The analysis decomposes the results of a longer and forward-looking scenario
    to assess the individual impacts of various drivers on global malnutrition.
  15: The SIMPLE model with a food security module is used to project food security
    outcomes in 2050, given trends in underlying drivers. The model was historically
    tested from 1991 to 2001.
  16: Analysis of individual drivers of global food security, scenarios looking at
    nutritional outcomes based on distribution of caloric consumption.
More Notes:
  1: The model links changes in average dietary energy intake to shifts in the full
    caloric distribution, allowing computation of changes in the incidence, headcount,
    and average depth of malnutrition.
  4: The malnutrition index and gap are treated as analogous to poverty index and
    gap measures, drawing on the work of Foster et al. (1984).
  5: Regional-level results are less satisfactory.
  6: The authors acknowledge that models can fail to accurately capture the distribution
    of crop production across regions and that regional factors such as economic transitions
    can affect food security.
  8: The model is tested against historical data. The paper considers crop yield effects
    from climate change with and without CO2 fertilization.
  11: Consumer responses to income and prices decline as per capita income rises.
  12: The paper acknowledges uncertainty about the magnitude of CO2 fertilization
    effects and their impact on crop yields.
  13: The analysis looks at nutritional outcomes that incorporate the distribution
    of caloric energy across world regions, rather than just average dietary energy
    consumption.
  14: The paper expresses the impacts of rising per capita incomes, increased biofuel
    use, TFP growth, and climate change yield effects relative to the contribution
    of population growth.
  15: Model performance is less satisfactory at the regional level, particularly in
    South Asia.
  16: The impact of climate change on future nutritional outcomes is uncertain and
    depends on the strength of CO2 fertilization yield impacts.

Quantitative material:
  1: Incidence of malnutrition falls by 84 per cent (2006-2050) under baseline scenario.
    24 per cent rise in global average dietary energy intake (2006-2050) under baseline
    scenario.
  4: "Equations (1) and (2) provide formulas to calculate growth elasticities for\
    \ the malnutrition index (\u025BMI) and the malnutrition gap index (\u025BMGI),\
    \ linking changes in average dietary energy intake to changes in these indices.\
    \ The equations use minimum daily energy requirement (MDER), average per capita\
    \ DEC, and the standard deviation of the DEC distribution."
  5: The model broadly replicates historical changes in average dietary intake, malnutrition
    incidence and gap at the global level for the period 1991-2001.
  6: Table presents quantitative data for 2006 (baseline) and projected 2050 scenarios
    for average dietary energy consumption, malnutrition index, malnutrition gap,
    and malnutrition count, across regions and under different climate change scenarios.
  8: Growth rates of drivers for the period 2006-2050 are listed in the Supporting
    information (Table S2 in Data S2).
  10: Figure 2 shows probability densities of dietary energy consumption for South
    Asia and Australia/New Zealand in 2006 and 2050. Figure 3 shows composition of
    food consumption in 2006 and 2050 in grams/capita/day. Globally, the volume of
    food consumption increases by about 31 per cent between 2006 and 2050.
  12: Without CO2 fertilization, global yields will decline by around 1.3 per cent
    per decade; With CO2 fertilization, yields are higher (by 2.2 per cent per decade
    globally); Global malnutrition incidence increases by about 16 per cent relative
    to the baseline scenario without CO2 fertilization; Malnutrition count increases
    by about 27 million relative to the baseline without CO2 fertilization.
  13: CO2 fertilization declines global malnutrition incidence by 20%. CO2 fertilization
    reduces malnourished persons globally by around 35 million. Population growth
    alone increased the global malnutrition count by 266 million between 1991 and
    2001.
  14: Table 2 provides quantitative estimates of the contribution of selected drivers
    on malnutrition count, both historically (1991-2001) and in a climate change scenario
    (2006-2050), broken down by region. For example, the individual impact of population
    on the global malnutrition count is 277 million in the 'No CO2 fert.' scenario.
  15: Increased biofuel use has roughly 6% of the contribution of population growth
    on global malnutrition count. Climate change, with no CO2 fertilization, has around
    16% of the contribution of population on the changes in the malnutrition count.
  16: From 1991 to 2001, population and TFP were the dominant drivers of malnutrition
    count. The impact of population on malnutrition headcount exceeds that of per
    capita income at the global level. Going forward to 2050, the relative impact
    of population on malnutrition count will be offset by the relative contribution
    of per capita income and TFP growth.
