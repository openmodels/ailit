Drivers of Risk:
  2: Shocks impacting dirty energy usage, the relationship between carbon concentration
    and temperature, and the connection between temperature and damages
  3: Three distinct mean-zero, symmetric shocks related to dirty energy usage, CO2
    emissions-temperature relationship, and climate-damage function parameter.
  5: Shocks to the climate system and the macro-economy, reaching a climate tipping
    point.
  6: Very adverse future shocks that could limit the scope for uniform welfare gains.
  7: Dirty energy's share in the production function is subject to symmetric shocks,
    which can influence CO2 emissions; Higher temperatures leading to lower total
    factor productivity; Tipping points, like the melting of Greenland's ice sheet,
    directly or indirectly lower productivity
  8: Shocks to dirty energy usage, shocks to the climate-sensitivity parameter, and
    shocks to the damage function's quadratic term (tipping point).
  9: Uncertainty about dirty energy usage (CO2 emissions), CO2-temperature sensitivity
    shock (climate-damage tipping points), damage-function parameter shock
  10: "Carbon-usage uncertainty (stochastic path of dirty energy's factor share, 1-\u03B3\
    t)"
  11: "The model considers stochastic shocks to the parameter \u03BBt, which affects\
    \ temperature based on the stock of carbon in the atmosphere."
  12: "Global mean surface temperature relative to its 1900 value (TAt), climate tipping\
    \ point (TPt), innovation/emissions uncertainty (\u03B3t), climate sensitivity\
    \ parameter (\u03BB)"
  13: "Uncertainty in climate sensitivity (\u03BB) and the tipping-point parameter\
    \ (TP) are the key drivers of risk in this model. Reaching the tipping point (TA_t\
    \ reaches TP_t) freezes the tipping point value."
  14: The focus is to minimize the probability of climate disasters.
  17: "Downward trend in \u03B3 leading to decreasing CO2 emissions."
  18: Uncertain CO2 emissions and the share of dirty energy remaining large over the
    next 50 years.
  19: Shocks to dirty energy usage can impact macroeconomic outcomes by affecting
    productivity losses and increasing the probability of a climate disaster.
  20: Delayed green energy adoption leading to potential catastrophic damages.
  21: Shocks to the decline of dirty-energy usage
  22: Uncertainty about future dirty energy usage, emissions, and the climate-sensitivity
    coefficient (how CO2 translates to temperature).
  23: Equilibrium climate sensitivity and its uncertainty impact climate projections.
  24: "Time-varying climate sensitivity parameter (\u03BB), temperature shocks (\u03F5\
    \u03BB,t), dirty energy usage, high CO2 concentration in the atmosphere."
  26: Energy usage and temperature shocks.
  27: Stochastic damage function with a tipping point based on excess temperature
  28: Climate disasters.
  29: The risk of lower tipping points and large damages enable substantial climate
    change damages to occur earlier.
  30: Increased damages from climate change; Uncertainty; Level of atmospheric carbon
    (CO2 concentration); Stochastic damage function; Low tipping point leading to
    significant damages
  31: Temperature increase beyond certain thresholds triggers steep increases in carbon
    tax.
  32: Uncertainty regarding climate change, specifically the timing and impact of
    tipping points; mean-preserving shocks to climate variables
Government:
  13: "The government imposes taxes on dirty energy use and distributes the revenues\
    \ among extant generations. Carbon-risk taxation ceases when \u03B3_t reaches\
    \ 1. Transfers are used to ensure the old are held at their status quo."
Highlights:
  2: Pareto-improving carbon taxation can dramatically lower climate risk, in general,
    and disaster risk, in particular
  3: Disasters can arise due to significant skewness in the distribution of damages,
    reinforced by non-linear supply and demand effects.
  5: The model identifies carbon policies that can improve future generations' welfare
    by up to 4% and reduce the probability of a climate disaster from 9% to 1%, without
    harming current generations' welfare. The level of carbon-risk taxation is substantial
    compared to the carbon average-damage process.
  6: The policy aims to limit the chance of significant reductions in aggregate consumption,
    influenced by potential significant declines from climate-related shocks akin
    to historical consumption drops caused by wars.
  7: Damages are similar to Nordhaus' if the global mean temperature increases by
    less than 3 degrees Celsius; Damages are significantly larger for temperature
    increases above 3 degrees Celsius, representing a tipping point.
  8: Energy-usage shocks are a prerequisite for generating climate disasters. Shocks
    to the climate-sensitivity parameter, in conjunction with energy usage shocks,
    are needed to significantly impact outcomes. A simple scheme that imposes a carbon
    tax at t=0, which then increases significantly when temperature increases, can
    lead to substantial welfare gains for all generations when all three shocks occur.
  9: Carbon-risk taxes (taxes needed to handle carbon risk) can be as large or larger
    than the carbon average-damage tax (taxes needed to handle average carbon damage).
  12: Climate change reduces output productivity; The model incorporates uncertainty
    in emissions, climate sensitivity, and tipping points; The use of dirty energy
    gradually declines, but can be temporarily reversed.
  14: Maximizes tax rate while ensuring no loss for any generation, aiming for a Pareto
    improvement across generations.
  17: In the absence of risk, there is essentially no scope/need for policy; The paper's
    goal is to understand the importance of carbon risk.
  18: Temperature increases cause GDP damages up to 18% over 250 years.
  19: A slow transition to clean energy dramatically raises the probability of a climate
    disaster.
  20: Delayed green energy investment can lead to significant GDP reduction (up to
    30%) in the worst-case scenario after 200 years, but there is potential for recovery
    after 500 years.
  21: A 25% tax on dirty energy leads to welfare gains, particularly for future generations,
    and significantly reduces the probability of climate disasters; Even with the
    tax, significant losses after 200 and 500 years are still possible, with temperature
    increases potentially exceeding the Paris Accord goals.
  24: Climate disasters occur frequently under business-as-usual scenarios; aggregate
    consumption can drop significantly (more than one third) for extended periods
    (100-400 years or even permanently); the model provides a lower bound on the possibility
    of climate disasters due to conservative calibration of climate sensitivity.
  26: An 'optimal' fixed tax rate on dirty energy is 20 percent. Generations born
    150 years from now or even later gain about 2 percent in certainty equivalence,
    and the probability of a climate disaster is reduced from more than 5 percent
    to around 2.5 percent.
  27: Adding a stochastic tipping point significantly increases the probability of
    climate disasters.
  28: Aggregate consumption losses of up to 80% are possible, although unlikely, due
    to climate disasters that can last for centuries.
  29: Imposing a 35% tax can decrease the probability of climate disasters to 3.5%,
    yet substantial climate disaster risk remains.
  30: Uncertainty significantly affects quantitative outcomes; Even with damages four
    times larger than typical calibrations, taxes and welfare gains are still relatively
    small in a world of certainty; Increasing taxes based on atmospheric carbon levels
    can further reduce the risk of climate disasters; High carbon taxes imposed after
    CO2 concentration has reached a certain level might lead to consumption disasters.
  31: Variable carbon tax rates can reduce climate disaster probability to 1.3%, but
    welfare gains are similar to those with a fixed tax.
  32: Introducing uncertainty into climate models leads to significant and long-lasting
    damages; carbon-risk taxes can achieve Pareto improvements and prevent climate
    disasters; the chosen parameters are conservative, implying that the results provide
    lower bounds on possible damages and on improving carbon taxes; carbon-risk tax
    rates can be as large, if not larger, than carbon average-damage tax rates depending
    on what intergenerational policies are feasible.
Methodology:
  2: 12-period, overlapping generations model with mean-zero, symmetric shocks
  3: Overlapping generations (OLG) model focusing on risk propagation with a simple
    calibration.
  5: Large-scale overlapping generations (OLG) model with shocks to both climate and
    the macro-economy to identify optimal carbon policies that leave the welfare of
    current generations unchanged, raise the welfare of future generations, and lower
    the probability of a climate disaster. Carbon tax policy is set to minimize the
    chance of reaching a climate tipping point subject to achieving a Pareto improvement
    for current and future generations.
  6: The analysis is performed using a stochastic Overlapping Generations (OLG) model
    focusing on finding Pareto paths to materially reduce the chances of a climate
    disaster. The model involves a tax on dirty energy and revenue sharing among generations
    to maintain expected utility.
  7: Uses a model where final goods are produced using dirty energy that emits CO2;
    Technological progress leads to crowding-out of dirty energy over time; Carbon
    cycle and temperature equation based on Golosov et al. (2014), simplifying Nordhaus
    (2017); Damages are a function of excess temperature, following Weitzman (2012)
    with a tipping point; Simulation includes uncertainty in the share of dirty energy
    in the production function.
  8: "The model is solved with and without uncertainty, assuming dirty energy is supplanted\
    \ by clean energy in 120 years. The authors use Weitzman (2012)'s damage function\
    \ and assume agents' coe\uFB03cients of relative risk aversion are 2."
  9: Dynamic general equilibrium model with overlapping generations of agents and
    a representative firm.
  10: Dynamic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents and incomplete financial
    markets.
  11: "The analysis models climate change as a negative externality using a carbon\
    \ cycle model where temperature depends on atmospheric carbon, with shocks to\
    \ the parameter \u03BBt."
  12: "The paper models the impact of climate change on output productivity (At) using\
    \ a damage function (Dt) that depends on global temperature (TAt) and a climate\
    \ tipping point (TPt). The model assumes that the dirty energy share in the production\
    \ function (\u03B3), the climate sensitivity parameter (\u03BB), and the tipping\
    \ point (TP) follow random walks."
  13: "The model incorporates uncertainty in climate sensitivity (\u03BB) and a tipping-point\
    \ parameter (TP), both following random walks with reflecting barriers (upper\
    \ and lower bounds). The model simulates the imposition of taxes on dirty energy\
    \ use by the government, with revenues distributed among generations. The study\
    \ considers both time-invariant and carbon-dependent carbon-risk taxes. Optimal\
    \ tax rates are explored via a grid search and a non-linear tax is also constructed."
  14: The study employs the projection method developed by various scholars and considers
    non-ergodicity in the early transition periods.
  15: The model uses cross-section and time series data to solve for period- and cohort-specific
    policy functions until dirty energy usage ceases (period 300). Agents forecast
    future consumption and choose optimal investment using Gaussian processes. Government
    policies are a function of time and the amount of carbon. Monte Carlo simulations
    are performed to estimate probabilities of climate disasters.
  16: The paper uses a model with households living for 12 periods (each representing
    5 years). The model incorporates carbon emissions, energy production, and atmospheric
    CO2 levels (both rapidly and slowly depreciating). It computes a 'consumption-equivalent
    factor' to compare expected utility under a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario versus
    a scenario with carbon taxes. The model uses parameters from Nordhaus (2015),
    Kotlikoff et al. (2019), Golosov et al. (2014) and Weitzman (2012).
  17: OLG (Overlapping Generations) model with no uncertainty (deterministic benchmark
    case); Grid search and lump-sum inter-generational transfers; Analysis focuses
    on the impact of carbon risk by comparing optimal carbon taxes with and without
    risk; Results applicable to a 500-year horizon.
  18: Deterministic model with specified average emissions path, modeling CO2 emission
    uncertainties with i.i.d. shocks to dirty energy share.
  19: The analysis includes simulations with multiple scenarios of shocks to dirty
    energy usage and their impact on economic damages and temperature distribution
    over periods of 100, 200, and 500 years using 1500 simulations.
  20: Simulation or model projecting damages and temperatures over 200 and 500 year
    time horizons.
  21: Optimal, fixed carbon tax rate calculation; Simulation of climate and economic
    paths; Considers shocks to dirty energy usage decline; Analysis timeframe extends
    to 500 years
  22: Combines uncertainty about future dirty energy usage and emissions with uncertainty
    about the climate-sensitivity coefficient.
  23: The analysis models climate sensitivity variation as a random walk due to the
    simplistic nature of the climate model used (Golosov et al., 2014).
  24: Computes equilibrium for an economy with no carbon taxes; simulates TFP-damages
    and temperature for periods 20, 40, and 100 (representing 100, 200, and 500 years
    respectively); uses histograms to show the distribution of outcomes.
  27: Model incorporates three shocks, with the tipping point shock modeled as a random
    walk between reflecting barriers (2.5 and 3.5).
  28: Model with disaster periods lasting more than 100 years and many for more than
    500 years; BAU scenario.
  30: Thought experiment with modified damage function and carbon taxes; Model with
    stochastic damage function and CO2 concentration as variables
  31: Carbon tax rates vary based on CO2 levels in the atmosphere, aiming to reduce
    climate disaster risk.
  32: The paper uses a model with and without uncertainty to examine optimal carbon
    taxation. Agents in the model learn about the tipping point when it happens.
More Notes:
  2: The paper focuses on climate risk, distinct from average climate damage
  3: The paper focuses exclusively on downside carbon risk rather than average carbon
    damage.
  5: Pareto improvements are defined with reference to expected lifetime utility.
  8: The climate-sensitivity parameter is modeled as a random walk with reflecting
    barriers at -30 and +30 percent around the mean.
  9: The model incorporates uncertainty regarding dirty energy usage, CO2-temperature
    sensitivity, and damage-function parameters. The effectiveness of different types
    of carbon taxes (fixed vs. CO2-dependent) in mitigating climate disaster risk
    is analyzed.
  10: "The model incorporates a carbon tax (\u03C4t) with revenue redistributed among\
    \ current generations. CO2 emissions are proportional to dirty energy use (Et)\
    \ with a factor \u03B9 calibrated to 2015 industrial emissions."
  12: "The model simplifies by ignoring secular growth; The model assumes dirty energy\
    \ usage ends after 300 years (\u03B360 = 1)."
  15: The model focuses on the transition from dirty to clean energy and considers
    the potential for rare events.
  17: CO2 emissions decrease monotonically and reach zero after 120 years; Maximum
    (excess) temperature is slightly below 2.8 degrees.
  20: The description lacks detail, only showing the general structure of the study
    instead of specific results.
  22: The images appear to visually depict distributions of damages and/or temperature,
    possibly related to the uncertainties described in the text. The text specifically
    references figures showing the distribution of damages and temperature after 100
    and 200 years.
  24: The study acknowledges limitations regarding the characterization of model uncertainty,
    especially how the climate sensitivity parameter is learned over time; the histograms
    do not show the fact that with a time-varying climate sensitivity parameter, output,
    and aggregate consumption become very volatile when the CO2 concentration in the
    atmosphere is high.
  26: Increase in precautionary savings caused by climate uncertainty can counteract
    the negative effects of extra uncertainty for early generations.
  28: Some future generations may only experience transitory climate disasters either
    before year 200 or after year 200.
  30: The paper considers the impact of time-varying and carbon-dependent taxes on
    climate risk.
  32: The model is a simplified version where agents do not know the tipping point
    and learn it when it happens. It is suggested that tax rates could be adjusted
    according to variables other than CO2 concentration, but the authors deem this
    unrealistic.

    having a 7% lower expected utility in consumption equivalents compared to today.
  30: Welfare gains for future generations; Consumption levels; CO2 emissions; Damage
    to production
  32: Welfare loss of future generations
Quantitative material:
  2: The climate-risk tax can be as large or larger than the carbon average-damage
    tax
  3: Probability of a climate disaster over the next 250 years is over 7 percent,
    and 9 percent over the next 500 years with no carbon policy.
  5: "Optimal carbon-risk taxation raises future generations\u2019 expected utilities\
    \ by up to 4 percent, and lowers the probability of crossing a calamitous climate\
    \ tipping point from 9 to 1 percent."
  7: "The damage function is defined as Dt= 1\u2212 1/(1+ ( TAt/20.46 )^2 +( TAt/6.081\
    \ )^6.754 ), where TAt is the global temperature increase; A 3-degree temperature\
    \ increase represents a tipping point."
  8: Initial generations gain about 0.1 percent in welfare, generations born in 150
    years gain about 4 percent, generations born in 200 years gain 5 percent, and
    welfare gains then slowly flatten to about 3 percent in the very long run when
    all three shocks occur simultaneously.
  9: Climate-disaster probability increases to almost 9% with all three types of uncertainty.
    Fixed carbon-risk taxes can reduce the probability of climate disasters to around
    3%. CO2-dependent taxes can reduce the likelihood below 1.5%.
  12: "Damage function Dt = 1 - (1/(1+(TAt/20.46)^2) + (TAt/2TPtTAt)^6.754), TPt =\
    \ 6.081, At = (1-Dt)Z, E\u03F5\u03B3t= 0.04, \u03B30 = 0.9, \u03B360 = 1"
  15: "Forecasts are accurate within a relative consumption error of at most 10^-3.\
    \ Simulations of the first 60 periods (300 years) are sufficient for good approximations.\
    \ 100 simulations of the first 60 periods typically suffice for good numerical\
    \ results. The economy is simulated for 100 model periods (500 years) 5000 times.\
    \ Initial conditions are set at t=0 with \u03B3=0.9 (\u03B3 is clean energy use).\
    \ Welfare changes are reported as consumption equivalents."
  16: "The paper uses specific numerical values for parameters: A = 12, \u03B1 = 0.3,\
    \ \u03B8 = 0.3, \u03B4 = 0.2, \u03C3 = 2.0, \u03B2 = 0.99, \u03BE = 0.4, \u03C6\
    \ = 0.5, \u03B4S1 = 1.0, \u03B4S2 = 0.99, \u03BB0 = 3.0, TP0 = 3.04, initial emissions\
    \ = 30 GtCO2/year."
  17: Maximum damages are less than 2.5 percent of final output; Average return to
    capital is about 3 percent per year; Optimal uniform carbon-tax of roughly 10
    percent increases expected utility by roughly 0.1 percent; Optimal tax is less
    than 5 percent when restricting Pareto policy.
  18: Welfare losses for future generations 6.5% lower; highest tax rate compatible
    without over-compensating current generations is about 15%.
  20: Worst-case scenario after 200 years corresponds to an almost 30 percent reduction
    in GDP.
  21: Optimal carbon tax rate of 0.25 (25% tax on dirty energy); Generations born
    200 years into the future gain 1.5% in consumption equivalence; Current generations
    and those in the near future gain 0.1-0.5%; After 125 years, welfare gains reach
    a maximum of 1.5% in about 200 years; In about 175 years, welfare gains are roughly
    1.3%; Climate disasters become very unlikely with a probability below 0.5% (in
    5000 simulated paths, only one occurred)
  24: "\u03F5\u03BB,t can take values of -1/30 or +1/30 with equal probability; \u03BB\
    \ can be 0.7\u03BB0 or 1.3\u03BB0; in about 5% of cases, aggregate consumption\
    \ drops by more than one third, lasting 100-400 years or forever; an increase\
    \ in the climate sensitivity from \u03BB to \u03BB changes the temperature by\
    \ more than 60 percent, which can change the damages from relatively small to\
    \ quite large when the initial excess temperature is above 3 degrees."
  26: Carbon tax is 5 percent lower than the one found above for the case of no climate
    uncertainty (25 percent).
  27: Probability of climate disasters increases to about 9 percent with the stochastic
    tipping point, compared to 5 percent without.
  28: Declines in aggregate consumption of almost 80 percent become possible, even
    though they are unlikely.
  29: A fixed tax of 35% increases the average welfare of generations born 200 years
    in the future by 4% in consumption equivalents.
  30: "Damage function modification: Dt= 1\u2212 (4)2 + (2TPtTAt)6.754 / 1+ (1 / 20.46\
    \ TAt)1; Pareto-improving fixed tax rate of roughly 20 percent leads to maximal\
    \ welfare gains of about 1.5 percent for generations born after 110 years; Damages\
    \ increase by approximately a factor of 4 after 20 model periods with the modified\
    \ damage function."
  31: Probability of climate disaster is reduced to around 1.3% with the specified
    tax.
  32: "Generations born after 250 years gain slightly more, but the di\uFB00erences\
    \ are below 0.5 percent (under some policy scenarios)."
