Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global warming, CO2 emissions, population growth, agricultural sector's vulnerability
    to atmospheric changes.
  6: Global warming (CLC)
  8: CO2 emissions, Food Imports, Arable Land
  9: Malnutrition (LNPREVMALNUTRI), Population growth (LNPG), Inflation (LNINF), Foreign
    Direct Investment (LNFDI), CO2 emissions per capita (LNCO2EMISSIONSPERCAP), Agricultural
    land (LNAL), Imports (LNFIMPORT)
  10: CO2 emissions; Global warming; FDI inflows
  11: Shocks impacting the outcomes include population growth, climate change-induced
    agricultural disruptions, and dependency on food imports.
  12: LNPG (Log of public governance), LNINF (Log of infrastructure), LNGDPPCAPITA
    (Log of GDP per capita), LNFIMPORT (Log of food import), LNFDI (Log of foreign
    direct investment), LNCO2_EMISSIONS__PER_CAP (Log of CO2 emissions per capita),
    LNAL (Log of agricultural land)
  13: Climate change (CO2 emissions, global warming, rainfall variability, temperature
    extremes)
Highlights:
  1: Positive long-term correlation between food insecurity and climate change in
    West Africa.
  6: The study investigates the effect of global warming on food security in West
    African countries.
  8: CO2 emissions have a statistically significant positive relationship with malnutrition
    prevalence. A 1% change in CO2 emissions is associated with an 18.3% change in
    malnutrition prevalence.
  9: No causal relationship between GDP per capita and malnutrition was found using
    the Granger causality test. A strong relationship between independent and dependent
    variables as implied by the rejection of Equation (15) H0 using the Generalised
    Linear Model.
  10: Increased CO2 emissions correlate with higher per capita GDP but worsen food
    insecurity in West Africa. There is a negative long-run relationship between food
    insecurity and FDI inflows in GLM estimates.
  11: A positive relationship exists between food imports and insecurity, highlighting
    a dependency on external markets. Population growth correlates with food insecurity,
    and there's a negative relationship between arable land availability and food
    insecurity.
  12: LNPG unidirectionally causes LNPREVMALNUTRI. LNPREVMALNUTRI unidirectionally
    causes LNINF. LNFIMPORT and LNPREVMALNUTRI are interdependent. LNGDPPCAPITA and
    LNCO2_EMISSIONS__PER_CAP unidirectionally cause each other. LNAL and LNCO2_EMISSIONS__PER_CAP
    unidirectionally cause each other.
  13: A causal link exists between food insecurity and global warming in West Africa
Methodology:
  1: Uses secondary panel data from 2000 to 2020 and employs the Kaoco-integration,
    FMOLS and GLM techniques.
  6: Panel data analysis using Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Generalized
    Linear Model (GLM). Data covers the period from 2000 to 2020 for 11 West African
    countries.
  8: Panel Unit Root Tests, Kao co-integration test, Panel FMOLS (Fully Modified Ordinary
    Least Squares) estimation. Results apply to West African countries studied.
  9: Correlation analysis, panel unit root tests (LLC, IPS, Fisher-type ADF, PP),
    Kao's co-integration test, Panel Granger Causality test, Generalised Linear Model
    (GLM).
  10: Panel unit root tests (first difference); Kao co-integration test; GLM estimates
  11: The analysis is performed using grouped mean panel FMOLS and GLM regression
    methods to examine the relationship between economic variables and factors like
    food insecurity and climate change impacts.

    panel granger causality techniques; Jarque-Bera test used for normality testing
    of error term
More Notes:
  1: Study focuses on West Africa.
  6: 'The model includes control variables: food prices, per capita GDP, population
    growth rate, food import and arable land. The study tests the null hypothesis
    (H0) that a causative link exists between global warming and food insecurity,
    against the alternative hypothesis (H1) that there is no causative link.'
  8: The paper examines the relationship between malnutrition prevalence and various
    macroeconomic factors. The analysis appears focused on malnutrition as the main
    outcome of interest, with some of the other variables being potential drivers.
  10: The analysis focuses on West Africa. The positive correlation between CO2 emissions
    and malnutrition is considered surprising by the authors.
  11: The findings emphasize the relationship between global warming, economic factors,
    and food security, suggesting the necessity for encompassing, climate-resilient
    plans.
  12: The analysis uses logged variables. The Wald test indicates that each variable
    in the model is significant at 0.05. Heteroscedasticity tests indicate no cross-sectional
    dependence among the residuals, and the residuals are normally distributed.
  13: The study recommends establishing a Climate-Smart Agriculture Program, a climate-resilience
    agricultural fund, focusing on policies of improved income consistent with game
    theory, and a Climate-Resilient Infrastructure Initiative, including a cross-border
    food reserve system
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Food insecurity, malnutrition prevalence, economic growth (GDP per capita), inflation.
  6: Food insecurity (FISEC), used as a proxy for the prevalence of malnutrition in
    the economy.
  8: GDP per capita
  9: GDP per capita (LNGDPPCAPITA)
  10: Food insecurity; GDP per capita
  11: The analysis indicates that inflation exacerbated by climate change-induced
    agricultural disruptions compounds food insecurity issues.
  12: LNPREVMALNUTRI (Log of prevalence of malnutrition)
  13: Food insecurity in West Africa
Quantitative material:
  1: Panel data from 2000 to 2020; econometric analysis provides evidence of a positive
    long-term correlation between food insecurity and climate change.
  6: Equation (16) presents a model for food insecurity (LNFISEC) as a function of
    several variables, including global warming (LN(CLC it)). It specifies hypothesized
    relationships (positive or negative) between the variables A1 > 0; A2 < 0; A3
    < 0; A4 > 0; A5 > 0; A6 < 0; A7 < 0.
  8: 'Table 2 presents summary statistics (Mean, Median, Maximum, Minimum, Std. Dev.,
    Skewness, Kurtosis, Jarque-Bera, Probability, Sum, SumSq. Dev., Obs.) for Prevalence
    of Malnutrition (%), Population Growth Rate, Food Imports (%), FDI (US$), CO2
    Emissions (Metric Tons per Capita), Arable Land (Hectares), and GDP per Capita
    (US$).

    FMOLS estimation indicates that a 1% change in CO2 emissions will lead to an 18.3%
    change in the prevalence of malnutrition.'

    growth, inflation, GDP per capita, foreign direct investment, CO2 emissions per
    capita, agricultural land, and imports. Panel unit root test results (Table 4)

  10: Kao co-integration test shows a significant long-term linkage between CO2 emissions
    and food insecurity in West Africa.  A t-statistic > 2 indicates the significance
    of global warming as a driver of food security challenges in West Africa.
  11: The FMOLS results indicate specific coefficients for variables such as LNCO2_EMISSIONS
    (183.938), LNPG (286.3820), and LNFIMPORT (4.3814) with significance reported
    at different levels.
