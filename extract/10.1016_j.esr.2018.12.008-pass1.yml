  7: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Climate change impacts on runo\uFB00 availability for hydropower generation;\
    \ Constraints on deployment of hydropower"
  2: Uncertainty is also introduced by the use of different General Circulation Models
    (GCMs) projections.
  3: Climate change impacts considered are limited to effects on hydropower supply,
    not on broader energy systems or economic factors.
  7: Climate change affecting hydroclimatic variables, potentially altering hydropower
    generation.
  10: Climate change (specifically variations in rainfall leading to 'Dry' or 'Wet'
    conditions), policy decisions regarding hydropower development (Boost Hydropower
    vs. Constrain Hydropower), and availability/cost of alternative energy sources
    (biomass, solar, wind, natural gas).
  11: Climate change (Wet, Mean, Dry scenarios) and policy decisions regarding hydropower
    development (HydropowerBoost, HydropowerConstrain, Environment Priority) are the
    primary drivers of risk.
Highlights:
  1: "Hydropower will remain as one of the most cost-e\uFB00ective and low emission\
    \ technologies in the Ecuadorian power sector in the long term; Climate change\
    \ impacts and deployment constraints could hinder the fulfillment of NDC targets\
    \ and create uncertainty around long-term power system costs; Strategies to hedge\
    \ against risks require complementing hydropower expansion with alternative sources\
    \ (natural gas, biomass, geothermal)."
  2: The study is the first to apply the TIMES model in detail to Ecuador, focusing
    on hydropower's role in the energy matrix and its policy implications.
  3: The model focuses on Ecuador's energy system and excludes comprehensive impacts
    of climate change, such as changes to wind and solar resources, or demand shifts.
  7: Hydropower is considered a main means of energy security in Ecuador, reducing
    electricity prices and mitigating GHG emissions, but anthropogenic warming may
    affect hydropower generation.
  10: Constraining hydropower development leads to a significant increase in electricity-related
    GHG emissions, especially under dry climate conditions, potentially exceeding
    Ecuador's NDC target by a large margin. Biomass emerges as a crucial alternative
    for deep decarbonization in scenarios where hydropower is constrained, but its
    resource availability and environmental impacts need further investigation.
  11: The choice of policy case (hydropower development strategy) has a greater impact
    on electricity prices than future variations in climate.
Methodology:
  1: Energy system optimisation model (TIMES-EC) using climate change scenarios derived
    from Global Circulation Models as input to examine least-cost options for the
    hydropower-dominated Ecuadorian power system to 2050.
  2: A mixed-integer linear programming formulation is used to model hydropower investment
    and operational flexibility, accounting for differences in project sizes and river
    basins.
  3: The study uses the TIMES-EC bottom-up optimization modeling platform with a focus
    on the energy sector in Ecuador, applying scenarios and socioeconomic projections.
  7: The paper uses climate change scenarios (NoCC, Mean, Wet, Dry) based on RCP4.5
    CMIP5 to assess hydropower availability. Policy cases (Boost Hydropower, Constrain
    Hydropower, Environment Priority) are developed separately from climate change
    scenarios to explore long-term energy system pathways under different energy and
    environmental policy decisions. The TIMES-EC model is used.
  10: The TIMES-EC model is used to simulate different energy policy scenarios under
    varying climate conditions to project electricity-related GHG emissions from 2015-2050.
    The model considers various energy sources and technologies, including hydropower,
    solar PV, biomass, wind, natural gas, and CCS.
  11: The analysis uses TIMES-EC model to simulate future policy decisions and climate
    variations and their impact on the electricity system costs over the period 2015-2050.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the Ecuadorian power system. It examines the impact of climate
    change on hydropower, a key component of Ecuador's NDC.
  3: The analysis is centered on energy modeling with assumptions specific to Ecuador,
    largely on hydropower, using inputs like socio-economic drivers and policy cases.
  7: The policy cases and climate developments are two different types of model input,
    with the climate assumptions exploring long-term uncertainty of hydropower production
    and the policy cases exploring different long-term evolutionary pathways for the
    energy system as the result of various energy and environmental policy decisions.
  10: The analysis identifies potential climate vulnerabilities of biomass resources
    due to higher temperatures and extreme hydrological conditions. The model indicates
    that solar PV is the preferred solar technology choice over concentrating solar
    power (CSP) with thermal energy storage. The model does not detect any carbon
    capture and storage (CCS) technologies due to cost.
  11: The paper explores the trade-offs between different hydropower development policies,
    considering economic costs, GHG emissions, energy security, and climate risks.
Outcome(s) of Interest:

    investment costs are used as indicators of economic impact, with a focus on electricity
    system costs.
Quantitative material:

    \ uses an energy system optimisation model (TIMES-EC) to examine least-cost options\
    \ to 2050 and assess trade-offs between power system con\uFB01guration, emissions\
    \ and costs."

    \ in GtCO2e under different policy and climate scenarios (e.g., up to 350 GtCO2e\
    \ under the Constrain Hydropower policy case and the Dry climate scenario). Electricity\
    \ generation is also quantified (TWh/y) under different scenarios. Installed capacity\
    \ (GW) of various energy sources by 2050 is also quantified under different scenarios."

    \ investment are measured in Billion US$ (US$2015)."
