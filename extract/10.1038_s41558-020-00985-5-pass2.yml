Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increases in seasonally adjusted day-to-day temperature variability.
  2: Day-to-day temperature variability (measured as intra-monthly standard deviation
    of daily temperature), and seasonal temperature difference.
  3: Day-to-day temperature variability, seasonal temperature difference, annual average
    temperature level, annual average temperature change, and total annual precipitation
    are the drivers of risk.
  4: Shocks include increased day-to-day temperature variability, which negatively
    impacts economic growth.
  5: Increase in day-to-day temperature variability.
  6: Day-to-day temperature variability
  8: Day-to-day temperature variability is analyzed as a climate shock impacting economic
    growth.
  10: Day-to-day temperature variability
  12: Day-to-day temperature variability increase (1 degree)
Highlights:
  1: Increases in day-to-day temperature variability reduce macro-economic growth
    independent of and in addition to changes in annual average temperature.
  2: Day-to-day temperature variability has a negative linear effect on regional growth
    rates; The effect is modulated by seasonal temperature difference; Countries with
    smaller seasonal temperature differences are affected more by day-to-day temperature
    variability.
  3: Day-to-day temperature variability has a statistically significant negative impact
    on regional growth rates. The reduction in growth rates due to day-to-day temperature
    variability is larger for regions with small seasonal temperature differences,
    implying a latitudinal dependence. Model 7 is selected as the preferred specification
    based on adjusted R-squared and BIC.
  4: Greater day-to-day temperature variability harms economic growth, irrespective
    of the proximity to heat-stress thresholds, with no significant impact found during
    winter.
  5: Lower-income regions are more vulnerable to increases in day-to-day temperature
    variability. Higher income enables regions to better utilize their exposure to
    large historical seasonal temperature differences to adapt to the effects of greater
    day-to-day variability. The negative effects of greater day-to-day temperature
    variability are not fully recovered in the medium term.
  6: "Day-to-day temperature variability constitutes a previously unidentified impact\
    \ channel of considerable magnitude in the climate\u2013economy relationship."
  10: Regions accustomed to smaller seasonal temperature differences suffer greater
    marginal losses (greater negative marginal changes) from a 1 degree increase of
    day-to-day temperature variability.
  12: The difference between the response of high- and low-income regions is not significant,
    but higher-income regions generally experience smaller marginal losses in regional
    growth rates from temperature variability.
Methodology:
  1: Fixed-effects panel models, combining observed day-to-day temperature variability
    with subnational economic data for 1,537 regions worldwide over 40 years.
  2: Fixed-effects panel regression models are applied to exploit within-region changes
    of day-to-day temperature variability and regional growth.
  3: Panel regression models are used to estimate the effect of climate variables
    on regional growth rates. Standard errors are clustered at the regional level.
    The analysis is applicable to regions where economic data is available.
  4: Analysis involves regression models considering day-to-day temperature variability
    and the effects on regional growth rates, using season-specific data and multiple
    robustness tests.
  5: CAN (Climate-economy Account Network) data is partitioned on the basis of median
    national income. A distributed-lag model is used to assess the persistence of
    impacts.
  6: Econometric specification; Considers the effect of day-to-day temperature variability
    on macroeconomic growth.
  8: Day-to-day temperature variability is calculated as the annual measure of intra-monthly
    standard deviation of temperature.
  10: Model (7) in Table 1 estimates the marginal effects. 95% confidence intervals
    are shown shaded.
  12: The methodology is based on models shown in Supplementary Table 9 and uses a
    partition based on Extended Data Fig. 2b.
More Notes:
  1: The impact of day-to-day variability is modulated by seasonal temperature difference
    and income.
  2: "Analysis is performed at a regional level using the ERA5 climate data for the\
    \ years 1979\u20132018 combined with a regional economic dataset. The effect of\
    \ day-to-day temperature variability is independent of changes in annual average\
    \ temperature."
  3: The paper suggests a nuanced relationship between temperature variability and
    economic growth, with the effect depending on geographic location. The image shows
    that the impact of day-to-day temperature variability on regional growth rates
    varies geographically. The paper further explores whether the observed effect
    of day-to-day temperature variability reflects the inherently damaging effects
    of greater variability in the realization of weather variables or merely potential
    nonlinearities in the response to the annual average temperature level.
  5: Climate and economic variables exhibit spatial autocorrelation.
  6: Spill-over effects may potentially attenuate or aggravate these effects, but
    a thorough assessment of their role requires explicit assessment of the trade,
    financial and infrastructure networks through which they may propagate, which
    is beyond the scope of this work.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Macro-economic growth; Regional growth rates.
  2: Regional growth rates, measured as the first difference of the logarithm of gross
    regional product.
  3: Regional growth rates are the outcome of interest.
  4: The paper discusses the adverse impact of day-to-day temperature variability
    on annual regional growth rates, indicating economic costs associated with climate
    variability.
  5: Marginal change in regional growth rate (percentage points).
  6: Economic growth
  10: Regional economic growth rates
  12: Regional growth rates
Quantitative material:
  1: An extra degree of variability results in a five percentage-point reduction in
    regional growth rates on average; highest vulnerability in low-latitude, low-income
    regions (12 percentage-point reduction).
  2: An extra degree Celsius of day-to-day temperature variability in a given year
    and region reduces the regional growth rate by at least five percentage points.
  3: Table 1 shows regression results with coefficients describing the estimated effect
    of a one-unit change in the climatic variable on the regional growth rate. For
    example, in model 7, the coefficient for T_r;y (day-to-day temperature variability)
    is -0.115***, indicating a statistically significant negative impact on regional
    growth rates.
  4: The paper mentions marginal changes in growth rates due to increased day-to-day
    temperature variability, with specific reference to regression models, though
    no specific numerical values are quoted on this page.
  5: Marginal losses from an increase in day-to-day temperature variability are generally
    larger for regions in low-income nations compared with those in higher-income
    nations (Fig. 4). The negative impacts of day-to-day variability persist for at
    least two years following the initial shock (Supplementary Table 10 and Supplementary
    Fig. 3).
  6: "Day-to-day temperature variability of 0.2\xB0C translates to economic growth\
    \ effects of approximately one percentage point under our central econometric\
    \ specification."
  8: The analysis yields 29,603 observations used in regression models on regional
    growth rates and temperature variability.
  10: "Marginal effects of a 1\xB0 Celsius increase of day-to-day temperature variability\
    \ on regional growth rates"
  12: Marginal effects of a 1 degree increase of day-to-day temperature variability
    on regional growth rates, estimated for regions with below- and above-median regional
    income. High-income regions generally experience smaller marginal losses.
