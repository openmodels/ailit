Drivers of Risk:
  1: Day-to-day temperature variability is identified as a key driver impacting economic
    growth.
  2: Day-to-day temperature variability (measured as intra-monthly standard deviation
    of daily temperature), modulated by seasonal temperature difference.
  3: Day-to-day temperature variability, seasonal temperature difference, annual average
    temperature level, annual average temperature change, total annual precipitation
  4: Day-to-day temperature variability.
  5: The primary driver of risk is an increase in day-to-day temperature variability.
  8: The main driver of risk is annual measure of day-to-day temperature variability.
    Yearly total precipitation is also used as a control.

    of gross regional product.

    economic growth rates.
  8: The paper evaluates the effect of day-to-day temperature variability on economic
    growth (gross regional product).
  10: Regional economic growth rates
  11: No relevant information
  12: Regional growth rates
Highlights:
  1: Highest vulnerability was found in low-latitude, low-income regions, which experience
    a 12 percentage-point reduction in growth rate.
  2: Day-to-day temperature variability has a negative linear effect on regional growth
    rates, and this effect is modulated by the seasonal temperature difference. The
    effect of day-to-day temperature variability on regional growth rates is unaffected
    by the inclusion of annual average temperature. Marginal losses from increased
    day-to-day temperature variability are largest in low-latitude and coastal regions.
  3: Model 7 is selected as the preferred specification based on adjusted R^2 and
    BIC. Figure 2 shows the effect of an extra degree of day-to-day temperature variability
    on regional growth rates varies geographically. The reduction is larger for regions
    that experience small seasonal temperature differences, implying a strong latitudinal
    dependence.
  4: The reduction in regional growth rates per extra degree of day-to-day temperature
    variability is larger in countries with lower GDP per capita. Day-to-day temperature
    variability in spring, summer, and autumn has significant effects on annual regional
    growth rates, while winter variability does not.
  5: Lower-income regions are more vulnerable to increases in day-to-day temperature
    variability due to their low income itself, in addition to their relative lack
    of exposure to large seasonal temperature changes. Higher income enables regions
    to better utilize their exposure to large historical seasonal temperature differences
    to adapt to the effects of greater day-to-day variability. The negative impacts
    of day-to-day variability persist for at least two years following the initial
    shock.
  10: Regions which are accustomed to smaller seasonal temperature differences suffer
    greater marginal losses (greater negative marginal changes) from a 1 degree increase
    of day-to-day temperature variability.
  11: Countries and regions are categorized by national and regional GRP per capita,
    using red for above-median income and blue for below-median income.
  12: When partitioned based on regional-income, the difference between the response
    of high- and low-income regions is not significant, although above-median income
    regions generally experience smaller marginal losses.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis combines observed day-to-day temperature variability with subnational
    economic data from 1,537 regions over 40 years using fixed-effects panel models.
  2: Fixed-effects panel regression models are applied to regional economic and climate
    data from 1979-2018. Models control for various other climate measures, including
    total yearly precipitation, linear and quadratic annual average temperature, the
    first difference of annual average temperature and its one-year lag, and interactions
    between these variables. The analysis is performed at the regional level.
  3: Panel regression models are used to assess the effect of climate variables on
    regional growth rates. Standard errors are clustered at the regional level. The
    study uses lagged variables (one-year lag). The adjusted R-squared and BIC are
    used to select the preferred model specification.
  4: Regression models are used to analyze the effect of day-to-day temperature variability
    on annual regional growth rates, controlling for heat-stress days. Robustness
    tests include using different climate re-analysis datasets, weighting climate
    data by population, including region-specific time trends, and excluding the United
    States, China, or major oil producers.
  5: The analysis partitions data based on median national income and re-evaluates
    the relationship between temperature variability and growth rates. It uses a distributed-lag
    model to assess the persistence of impacts, applicable for 1979-2018.
  8: The paper uses fixed-effects panel regression models to estimate the effect of
    temperature variability on economic growth, using climate data from ERA5, WFDEI,
    and EWEMBI reanalysis datasets for the period 1979-2018. The climate data are
    aggregated to the regional level using area weighting. Various model specifications
    are used, including interaction terms between temperature variability and average
    seasonal temperature difference, and controls for annual average temperature,
    temperature change, and precipitation.
  10: Estimated by model (7) in Table 1
  11: The data is partitioned based on above- and below-median national and regional
    averages of regional income (GRP) per capita using data from 2008 or the closest
    year with available data. This partitioning is used to estimate results shown
    in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 3.
  12: Estimated for regions with below- and above-median regional income. The results
    shown here are based on the partition shown in Extended Data Fig. 2b and, and
    the models used to estimate the marginal effects are those shown in Supplementary
    Table 9.
More Notes:
  2: The paper uses the ERA5 climate data from 1979-2018 combined with a regional
    economic dataset.
  4: The effects of day-to-day variability are approximately equal across the agricultural,
    manufacturing and services sectors.
  5: Adaptation to the impact of day-to-day temperature variability is dependent on
    national income as well as long-term exposure of economic agents to large seasonal
    temperature differences. The effects of climate are differentiable by income at
    the national but not at the regional level, given that adaptation is likely to
    be coordinated between regions of a given country.

    with a vertical line indicating the median income.
Quantitative material:
  1: An extra degree of temperature variability results in a five percentage-point
    reduction in regional growth rates on average.
  2: "An extra degree Celsius of day-to-day temperature variability reduces the regional\
    \ growth rate by at least five percentage points. Losses per extra degree of day-to-day\
    \ temperature variability can be as small as three percentage points in regions\
    \ with seasonal temperature variation of over 40\xB0C. Marginal losses can be\
    \ greater than 10 percentage points in regions with seasonal temperature differences\
    \ less than 3\xB0C."
  3: The paper provides regression results (Table 1) showing the effect of climate
    variables on regional growth rates. Model 7 shows a coefficient of -0.115 for
    annual average temperature level, 0.00192 for the interaction of annual average
    temperature level and seasonal temperature difference, and 0.000248 for total
    annual precipitation. Also coefficients are given for annual average temperature
    change and interactions with day-to-day temperature variability, as well as interactions
    of annual average temperature change and annual average temperature level.
  4: Marginal change in growth rate (percentage points).
  5: The study finds that marginal losses in growth rate (percentage points) are generally
    larger for regions in low-income nations compared to higher-income nations from
    an increase in day-to-day temperature variability. It also notes that negative
    impacts of day-to-day variability persist for at least two years.
  8: The paper estimates the percentage-point change in regional growth rates per
    unit change of the explanatory variable (day-to-day temperature variability).
