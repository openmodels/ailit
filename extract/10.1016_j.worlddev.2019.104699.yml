Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, historical climate-induced losses, exposure to climate hazards,
    vulnerability to climate hazards.
  2: Climate variability and change; climate-related disasters; year-to-year changes
    in climatic variables; intensifying consequences of climate change; uneven modifications
    in precipitation and temperature patterns
  3: Precipitation and temperature extremes (intensity and frequency), mean temperature
    and precipitation levels, climate change
  5: Precipitation (categorized into extreme & severe dry/wet, moderately dry/wet,
    near normal dry/wet, and normal dry/wet), and temperature (linear and squared
    terms) are the primary drivers of risk considered.
  7: Climate variability, specifically precipitation and temperature patterns, impacting
    GDP per capita growth.
  8: Changes in precipitation and temperature induced by future climate change.
  9: Climate change (low warming (RCP2.6) and high warming (RCP8.5) scenarios).
  10: Climate variability and change, warming scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5).
  11: Climate variability and change (temperature and precipitation extremes); lack
    of efficient economic policies (impeding open trade and the protection of private
    property rights); unchecked warming levels.
  12: Current emission trends, climate change
Highlights:
  1: Climate change is projected to detrimentally affect African countries' economic
    development and widen inequalities between countries in high warming scenarios.
    Many African economies are poorly adapted to their current climatic conditions.
  2: "Climate variability and change is a meaningful determinant to consider in the\
    \ economic debate on economic convergence; Climate change could lead to an accelerated\
    \ income convergence or divergence across African countries; Improving the scientific\
    \ understanding of the consequences of climate-related disasters on African countries\u2019\
    \ economic development is of significant importance."
  3: Agriculture in Africa is highly vulnerable to climate change; Without adaptation,
    rice production could experience drastic consequences; Climate change could also
    have negative impacts on labour productivity
  5: Extreme dry and wet events have significant negative effects on GDP per capita.
    Trade openness has a positive statistically significant effect with a lag of 5
    to 10 years. GDP per capita sensitivity to precipitation segments describes a
    concave relationship.
  7: "Precipitation has a greater influence than temperature on GDP per capita during\
    \ the 1980\u20132014 period."
  8: Economic risks are potentially underestimated as lagged consequences on GDP per
    capita are not accounted for.
  9: Climate change, particularly in the high warming scenario, is projected to slow
    down or delay the convergence of income between African countries. The impact
    varies across regions and is influenced by factors such as population size, reliance
    on agriculture, and resource endowments. Countries with large populations and
    agricultural sectors are more vulnerable.
  10: Mitigation action provides early benefits, with economic impacts diverging between
    low and high warming scenarios in the 2030s. By 2050, impacts in the high warming
    scenario are almost twice as high as in the low warming scenario. African countries
    are poorly adapted to current climate variability.
  11: "Climate change is projected to significantly slow down income convergence between\
    \ African countries; adaptation needs are significant even if warming is limited\
    \ close to 1.5\xB0C; coordinated action across countries is required for emission\
    \ mitigation as well as climate resilience."
Methodology:
  1: 'Economic model embedding three dimensions of risks at the country-level: exposure,
    vulnerability and hazards.'
  2: Analysis of the extent to which climate variability and change is a meaningful
    determinant in the economic debate on economic convergence; Estimation of the
    extent to which climate change impacts could impede the progress towards economic
    convergence between African economies; Model dynamically satisfies the three dimensions
    of disaster and climate risks by considering exposure, vulnerability and hazards
  3: Economic framework developed following the concept of 'risk triangle' (hazard,
    exposure, and vulnerability); Non-linear regression model measuring the sensitivity
    of GDP per capita to contiguous levels of precipitation intensity and temperature;
    Econometric approach to estimate past and future effects of climate-related disasters
    and climate change on GDP
  5: Panel regression with time lags (0, 1, 5, and 10 years) is used. Newey-West heteroskedasticity
    and autocorrelation corrected (HAC) standard errors are reported. Authors' computation
    based on NCEP population-weighted precipitation and temperature data. Considers
    optimal deviation from temperature mean.
  7: Ratio of effect standard deviation employed to measure relative importance of
    climate variables versus socioeconomic variables on GDP per capita.
  8: Analyzes the effect of future climate change on Africa's income convergence against
    the same SSP2 socioeconomic baseline for GDP per capita growth.
  9: GDP per capita estimated for 2015-2050 using SSP2 as baseline, impact on inequalities
    is measured using weighted/non-weighted Gini and Atkinson indexes.
  10: Econometric analysis and climate modeling used to project economic impacts and
    inequality, applicable to African countries.
  11: Analysis of the consequences of climate change on income convergence across
    African countries; using diverse decision-making tools for climate change adaptation.
  12: The paper acknowledges support for research under the Economic Growth, Development
    and Climate Change in Africa project, suggesting an econometric or modeling approach
    may have been used in the broader study which it is part of.
More Notes:
  1: The analysis raises issues on the ability of African countries to reach their
    SDGs targets and the potential increasing risk of instability, migration across
    African countries, of decreased trade and economic cooperation opportunities as
    a consequence of climate change.
  5: Optimal temperature is estimated relatively to each country's historical mean,
    rather than as an absolute temperature. Sensitivity of GDP per capita to severely-extremely
    dry events is lower than to severely-extremely wet events.
  7: Emphasizes the importance of both temperature and precipitation in economic analyses
    of climate impacts.
  9: There is a difference in impact depending on whether population weighting is
    used in the inequality calculations. Population weighted measures suggest a larger
    delay in income convergence.
  10: The study highlights the need for stringent mitigation policies, revision of
    economic models (PAGE, DICE, FUND), and addressing the adaptation deficit in African
    countries. There is a focus on the distributional consequences of climate change,
    measured by inequality indices.
  11: Highlights the importance of integrating historical adaptation deficit and future
    adaptation needs in development and adaptation planning; suggests modifying the
    allocation methodology of development banks to integrate current and projected
    impacts of climate change.

Quantitative material:
  1: Historical mean climate-induced losses between 10 and 15 percent of GDP per capita
    growth.
  2: "Droughts in the Sahel in the 1970s led to steep double-digit decreases in countries\u2019\
    \ GDP and agricultural value-added"
  3: 'Mean risk on yield across the African continent: -10% for Millet, -17% for Wheat,
    -5% for Maize, -15% for Sorghum; Irrigated rice yields in the dry season could
    decrease by up to 45% without adaptation, 15% with adaptation; Number of lost
    working days due to high temperature could increase by 3.4 percentage points in
    Western Africa in the 2050s (SRES A2)'
  5: Regression coefficients for precipitation and temperature variables, along with
    their standard errors and significance levels, provide quantitative estimates
    of their impact on GDP per capita.
  7: "Estimated annual losses due to climate variability in African countries range\
    \ from 5% to 15% of GDP per capita growth over 1986\u20132015."
  8: Northern, Southern and Central African regions would be the least affected with
    projected deviation below 10 percent in GDP per capita compared to the baseline
    and limited to below 5 percent in Central African countries.
  9: GDP per capita growth risk (deviation from baseline) in 2030 for different African
    regions under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios (Table 2). Delay in income convergence
    (10-11 years median delay in high warming scenario)
  10: Projected Gini and Atkinson inequality indices for different warming scenarios
    (RCP2.6, RCP8.5) from 2020 to 2050, compared to a baseline scenario (SSP2); Delayed
    convergence in inequality indices measured in years.
  11: "Suggests that the projected negative macroeconomic impacts are significantly\
    \ smaller, and possibly more manageable, when global mean temperature increase\
    \ remains below two degrees and very close to 1.5\xB0C (the low warming scenario,\
    \ RCP2.6)."
