Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change leading to increased heatwave frequency and duration across South
    Africa, particularly under high greenhouse gas concentration scenarios (RCP 8.5).
  5: Changes in temperature indices (Tn10P, Tn90P, Tx10P, Tx90P, DTR) and Heatwave
    occurrence
  7: "Projected increases in daily average maximum temperatures, with increases of\
    \ up to 2\xB0C during summer (December, January, February) across the country's\
    \ plateau for the period 2010-2039 compared to 1983-2012; Temperature increases\
    \ are projected to be larger in the medium-term (2040-2069) than in the near-term\
    \ (2010-2039); RCP 8.5 projections show increases of over 3\xB0C in four provinces\
    \ of South Africa and parts of Lesotho."
  11: Increased heatwave frequency driven by climate change, specifically under RCP
    4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
  12: Increase in heatwave frequency and intensity over different time periods and
    climate scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5)
Highlights:
  1: "30-year period average maximum temperatures may rise by up to 6 \xB0C across\
    \ much of the interior of South Africa by 2070\u20132099 with respect to 1983\u2013\
    2012, under a high GHG concentration. The north-western part of South Africa is\
    \ expected to have the most drastic increase in heatwave occurrences. Heatwaves\
    \ across the central interior are expected to last longer."
  7: Daily average maximum temperatures are projected to increase significantly, particularly
    under the RCP 8.5 scenario.
  11: Heatwave frequency is projected to increase in South Africa, particularly in
    the eastern parts, with the western parts experiencing the smallest increase due
    to cold fronts. The spatial pattern of simulated heatwave frequency corresponds
    closely between the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios for the immediate future period
    (2010-2039).
  12: Projected increase in heatwave frequency and intensity across various regions
    and time periods under different climate scenarios
Methodology:
  1: "Analysis uses an ensemble of regional climate model downscalings obtained from\
    \ the Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) for the periods 2010\u20132039,\
    \ 2040\u20132069, and 2070\u20132099, with 1983\u20132012 as the historical baseline.\
    \ Simulations were performed under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)\
    \ 4.5 and 8.5."
  5: Trend analysis of selected temperature indices from 1983 to 2012. Significance
    tested at the 95% level of confidence.
  7: "Temperature projections are based on RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, with results\
    \ shown as the 50th percentile difference in average Tx (\xB0C) between the reference\
    \ period (1983-2012) and future periods (2010-2039, 2040-2069, and 2070-2099)."
  11: Climate simulations under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios projecting heatwave
    frequency for the periods 2010-2039, 2040-2069, and 2070-2099. 50th percentile
    projections are used. Analysis based on DJF (December-January-February) and JJA
    (June-July-August) seasons. Results are applicable for South Africa.
  12: "Simulations of heatwave frequency using RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios for periods\
    \ 2010\u20132039, 2040\u20132069, and 2070\u20132099"

  7: The analysis focuses on temperature changes in South Africa and neighboring countries.
  11: The analysis focuses on heatwave frequency and does not directly address macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes. The provided images (not included in the text summary) provide
    further information about the spatial and temporal distribution of heatwave events
    under different RCP scenarios.

    C during the period 2010 to 2039 compared to the reference period of 1983 to 2012;\
    \ RCP 8.5 projections show increases of over 3\xB0C in four provinces of South\

  11: Projected increase in heatwave events in eastern and northern parts of South
    Africa to over 80 events in 2010-2039, about 10 more than present-day climate
    frequency. Western parts of South Africa are simulated to experience less than
    10 heatwave events over the 30-year period.

    \ the Highveld of Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal; Seasonal average temperatures\
    \ during DJF ranging from 41 to 44\xB0C in north-western South Africa"
