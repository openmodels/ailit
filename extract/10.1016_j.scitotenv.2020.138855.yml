Drivers of Risk:
  6: Impacts of Hydrometeorological Hazards (HMHs)
  7: Hazardous meteorological and hydrological events (HMHs) such as droughts, floods,
    heatwaves, and landslides.
Highlights:
  6: The linkages between weather extremes and their impacts on the economy, ecosystems
    and people's safety are evident and further testified by the alarmingly increasing
    number of HMHs-related disasters.
  7: Flooding caused the largest economic damages (76.2%) among HMHs, followed by
    droughts (13.9%), heatwaves (8.4%), and landslides (1.5%).
Methodology:
  6: Statistical analysis of EM-DAT and Munich Re-NatCatSERVICE databases to capture
    the spatial distribution of HMH fatalities and economic damages across Europe.
  7: "Analysis based on historical data from the EM-DAT database for the last 120\
    \ years (1900\u20132019) examining economic damages and fatalities due to HMHs\
    \ in Europe."
More Notes:
  6: Focus on European countries; Data primarily from EM-DAT and Munich Re.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  6: Economic damages (in billion US$)
  7: Expected increase in economic loss in Europe from 14.4 billion USD per year to
    nearly 88.8 billion USD per year by the end of the 21st century.
Quantitative material:
  6: Loss of life figures; Economic damages figures (billion US$)
  7: Economic losses of approximately 502.6 billion USD due to HMHs over the last
    120 years; Germany incurred losses of about 12.9 billion USD in 2002 and 7.8 billion
    USD in 2013 from floods.
