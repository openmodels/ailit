  14: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Water scarcity, extreme temperature events, and soil degradation in drylands
    contribute to risks affecting food security and resilience.
  9: The paper implicitly addresses drivers of risk by analyzing trends in NUS cultivation
    and trade balance, suggesting potential risks related to food security and import
    dependence. It highlights the region's reliance on wheat imports.
  13: Heat stress, water scarcity, monocropping.
  14: Climate variability, water scarcity, pest infestations, climate change, socio-economic
    challenges, policy gaps, market access issues, climatic stresses, soil degradation,
    pest and disease pressures exacerbated by climate change.
Highlights:
  1: Neglected and underutilized species (NUS) demonstrated superior water productivity
    and heat tolerance compared to major cereals, contributing significantly to dietary
    calories.
  9: NUS cultivation areas have declined in many MENA countries since their peak.
    Imports of NUS have significantly increased in the MENA region. The MENA region
    relies heavily on wheat imports, leading to a negative trade balance for both
    NUS and wheat.
  13: "Lentil\u2013quinoa and lentil-chickpea relay intercropping consistently outperforms\
    \ wheat monocropping in sustainability indicators, exhibiting lower GHGI while\
    \ enhancing protein yield."
  14: Diversifying production with NUS could reduce dependency on wheat imports and
    improve food security. NUS enhance resilience to climate change and water scarcity,
    improving water productivity with heat tolerance.
Methodology:
  13: "Field experimentation in Morocco during 2019/20 and 2020/21 growing seasons\
    \ comparing wheat monocropping with lentil\u2013quinoa and lentil-chickpea relay\
    \ intercropping."
More Notes:
  9: The analysis focuses on the agricultural sector and specifically on NUS and wheat.
    While not directly related to macroeconomic variables like GDP, it provides insights
    into food security and trade dependencies, which can indirectly affect a nation's
    macroeconomic stability, especially in the context of climate change impacts on
    agriculture. The term NUS may need to be understood better to ensure proper relevance.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  9: The paper focuses on import and export quantities and values related to neglected
    and underutilized species (NUS) and wheat in the MENA region.
  13: 'Sustainability indicators: Protein yield, Total calorie yield, Greenhouse gas
    emission intensity (GHGI), Gross margin, Water use efficiency.'
Quantitative material:
  9: The paper provides quantitative data on NUS cultivation areas (Mha) in specific
    countries and regions, import and export quantities (Mt) of NUS and wheat, and
    import and export values (USD billion) of NUS. For example, it states that NUS
    imports in the MENA region increased from 0.19 Mt in 1961 to 8.13 Mt in 2022.
  13: Figure 9 presents comparison of economic and environmental sustainability indicators
    (protein yield, total calorie yield, greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI),
    gross margin, water use efficiency) for wheat, lentil, lentil + chickpea, and
    lentil + quinoa relay-intercropping in the 2019/20 and 2020/21 cropping seasons
    in Merchouch, Morocco.
  14: "NUS cultivation showed an overall increase from 1961 to 2022, although a recent\
    \ decline\u2014from 22.52 Mha in 2018 to 21.1 Mha in 2022."
