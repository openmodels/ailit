Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (specifically temperature changes), projected growth of Gross
    Domestic Product per capita.
  5: Annual mean temperature (TempI, TempJ), precipitation (PrecI, PrecJ).
  7: Temperature and precipitation variations in origin and destination countries;
    geographic factors like distance and coastline.
  8: Changes in temperature and precipitation affecting tourism preferences and behavior.
  9: Climate change impacts (temperature, precipitation), GDP, population.
  11: Change in temperatures and GDP per capita.
  12: Climate change impacts on temperature, and its interaction with GDP per capita
    growth in origin and destination countries.
  13: Climate change induced effects on biodiversity loss, dry episodes, beach transformations,
    etc.
Highlights:
  1: Turning point temperatures in origin and destination countries have changed,
    evidencing a loss of competitiveness for traditional warm destinations. Climate
    change would imply a greater loss of attractiveness for traditional warm destinations
    and increase attractiveness for high latitude countries.
  6: The surface area and length of coastline in the destination country have a positive
    effect on tourist arrivals.
  7: Temperature and coastal characteristics have significant impacts on tourism flows.
  8: Tourists prefer sunny, dry destinations, and colder destination countries have
    increased attractiveness. Warmer origin countries see higher international departures.
  9: Climate change may lead to a gradual shift of tourist destinations towards higher
    latitudes. Colder countries such as Canada or Russia would become more attractive.
    Economic growth can moderate the negative impacts of climate change on tourism.
    The United States and countries from the southern hemisphere are expected to be
    the losers. Western European tourists travelling to the Mediterranean region would
    stay closer to home.
  11: Tourist destinations located in lower latitudes may be replaced by countries
    such as China, Russia, and Canada, inverting the tourist 'gravity' force towards
    higher latitudes. Significant percentage changes (both positive and negative)
    in tourist arrivals are projected by 2080 under various climate scenarios.
  12: Global warming is generally bad for warm tourist destinations, potentially leading
    to a loss of competitiveness. It may increase attractiveness for high-latitude
    countries. Optimal climatic conditions exist for both destination and origin countries
    influencing tourism flows, revealed through non-linear relationships.
  13: The model has spatial-temporal limitations due to the tourist databases used
    and ignores possible saturation in tourism demand. It also neglects changes in
    preferences, age structure, working hours and life styles that would affect tourist
    behavior.
Methodology:
  1: A demand model for international tourism is estimated, including classic determinants
    and time-varying climatic sensitivity. Data for projected GDP per capita and climatic
    conditions within A2, B1, and B2 scenarios are used to assess impacts on international
    tourism.
  5: Regression analysis using a gravity model to estimate tourist flows between countries,
    including climatic, spatial, and economic variables as predictors. Fixed effects
    are used for origin, destination and year. Historical climatic conditions are
    held constant while tourist sensitivity is assumed to be able to change.
  6: The methodology involves a linear and a squared time trend to test for turning
    points in tourists' climate sensitivity.
  7: Regression analysis using equations with Huber-White estimator for robust standard
    errors.
  9: Simulation using IPCC climate change scenarios (A2, B1, B2) and projections for
    2080; estimates tourism flows based on GDP, population, temperature, and precipitation
    projections. The year 2007 is used as a reference year.
  11: Comparison of tourist arrivals in 2080 under different climate scenarios (A2,
    B1, B2) to arrivals in 2007. The maps indicate spatial variation.
  12: The paper uses an unspecified estimation method and database to extrapolate
    estimates for A2, B1, and B2 scenarios. Results are applicable for long term predictions.
More Notes:
  1: Tourism represents 9.1% of the total world Gross Domestic Product.
  7: Long coastlines alone are not enough for tourism; favorable weather is also necessary.
  8: Turning point temperatures for tourism have changed from 1995 to 2010, possibly
    due to real warming or changes in tourist climate preferences.
  9: 'The paper highlights that tourism is affected by climate change directly via
    temperature and precipitation, and indirectly through impacts on population and
    economic growth. Economic growth impacts tourism in two ways: making a country
    more attractive and increasing tourist departures.'
  11: The paper uses three climate change scenarios (A2, B1, and B2) to model the
    impact on tourist arrivals. The maps visually represent the spatial distribution
    of these projected changes.
  12: 'The paper finds an inverted u-shape relationship between destination temperature
    and tourism demand, and a u-shape relationship between origin country temperature
    and tourism demand. Climate change increases the climate sensitiveness of international
    tourism. '
  13: 'Some questions remain: Will some destinations be too hot? What are the most
    sensitive segments to climate change?'

    on tourism, without providing specific quantitative macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    risk assessments, adaptation costs/benefits at a national level, or methodologies

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Loss of competitiveness for traditional warm destinations, increased attractiveness
    for high latitude countries, impacts on international tourism flows.
  5: Impact of climate on tourist destination choice.
  7: Impact of macroeconomic variables such as GDP per capita and geographic variables
    like coastlines on tourism.
  9: Tourism numbers (as proxy for economic impact) are used to assess the costs and
    benefits of climate change.
  11: Percentage variation in tourist arrivals.
  12: Distributional effect of climate change on international tourism arrivals in
    various countries
  13: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: Complete database considering international tourism movement between 178 countries
    for the period 1995 to 2010 is used.
  7: Regression coefficients for variables like GDP per capita, coastlines, and temperature
    with significance levels.

    A2, B1, and B2, both with and without GDP per capita growth effects, are quantified

    ignoring possible saturation.
