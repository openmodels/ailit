Drivers of Risk:
  1: Floods in the Mediterranean region influenced by changes in land use, increased
    vulnerability, and climate-induced changes in precipitation patterns.
  2: Characteristics of rainfall or water flow, the available means of evacuating
    the population and raising awareness, initial soil moisture conditions prior to
    flood events.
  3: The Mediterranean region is prone to hydrometeorological risks due to the convergence
    of subtropical and polar air masses, warm sea surrounded by mountainous terrain,
    which leads to cyclogenesis and unstable air masses, resulting in flash floods
    and strong wind storms. Climate change exacerbates these risks, especially for
    the growing population living in coastal areas.
  12: Increase in urban surfaces and impermeable soil (like the new airport) gave
    rise to an increase in extraordinary floods, despite the fact that maximum precipitation
    showed no increase, with the exception of Barcelona; Increase in vulnerability
    and exposure due to increased population and urban settlements in flood-prone
    areas along the coast; Local heavy rainfall events in non-gauged catchments.
  14: "Global warming of 1.5\xBA, 2\xBA and 3\xBA C above pre-industrial levels; different\
    \ population scenarios; projections of population, urbanization and Gross Domestic\
    \ Product on a global and national scale; climate change and population change;\
    \ more intense and concentrated rains in very short periods of time, together\
    \ with the degradation of the basins; increased vulnerability and exposure."
Highlights:
  1: Flood impacts in the Mediterranean are expected to increase due to global changes
    in catchments and an increase in heavy rainfalls in the northern part of the basin.
  2: Floods are the natural risk with the greatest impact in the world because of
    their frequency and the socioeconomic and environmental losses they produce.
  3: Floods in the Mediterranean region are usually sudden, known as flash floods,
    and are favored by coastal and pre-littoral mountain ranges that concentrate torrential
    rain in small basins.
  12: While most studies agree that flood damage is increasing, observations point
    to the opposite in some regions like Spain and Southern France; Increased economic
    impact of floods in Spain may be due, in part, to an increase in insured property
    and the cost of living.
  14: An increase in the probability of an event with significant economic damage
    occurring, with greater increases with increased warming and when both climate
    change and population change are included. Flash floods in small non-gauged basins
    are increasing due to increased vulnerability and exposure, but it seems that
    the hazard is also increasing in some zones due to more intense and concentrated
    rains in very short periods of time, together with the degradation of the basins.
Methodology:
  3: This article presents the most recent findings on the evolution of floods in
    the Mediterranean region and the possible impact of climate change; it is a review
    paper.
  14: Uses EURO-CORDEX downscaled climate projections; Lisflood hydrological model;
    Mann-Kendall test; peak over threshold (POT) approach after fitting a Gumbel extreme
    value distribution using the L-moments approach; seven regional climate model
    simulations from the EURO-CORDEX project; considers 5 different socioeconomic
    scenarios that include projections of population, urbanization and Gross Domestic
    Product on a global and national scale; takes the 40 mm threshold as indicative
    of the possibility of sudden flooding in small basins.
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on the Mediterranean region and mentions the MEFF database
    (flood-related fatalities in the Mediterranean basin).
  3: The sociocultural and historical context is enormously heterogeneous in the Mediterranean
    region, with uneven distribution of resources, where the North has greater well-being,
    economic development, and governmental stability, while the South and the Middle
    East are characterized by rapid population growth.
  14: There is insufficient evidence that river floods are increasing in the Mediterranean.
    There is a natural variability already detected in secular series that is still
    not completely explained.

  5: This page focuses on defining hazards, particularly floods, and presenting a
    framework for risk assessment (hazard and vulnerability). It does not provide
    specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, quantitative data, or detailed methodologies
    related to climate change adaptation at a national level.
  18: This page primarily contains bibliographic references, and does not present
    specific findings related to macroeconomic/macro-fiscal outcomes, costs/benefits
    of adaptation, or relevant methodologies. The references predominantly focus on
    floods and precipitation patterns, particularly in the Mediterranean region and
    Spain, but do not directly quantify the economic consequences or adaptation measures
    at a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Socioeconomic losses due to floods.
  3: No relevant information
  12: Increased economic impact of floods in Spain due, in part, to an increase in
    insured property and the cost of living.
  14: Probability of flood damage in eastern Spain.
Quantitative material:
  2: Between 1980 and 2018, 1809 fatalities were recorded across six Mediterranean
    regions.
  3: No relevant information
  12: Change in the average annual discharge of floods per decade in Spain would be
    between -5 and -12%; Positive and significant trend of 2,5 floods/decade in regions
    of Italy, France and Spain for the 1981-2010 period would be mainly due to extraordinary
    floods.
  14: Climate projections agree on a 30% reduction in annual precipitation in southern
    European countries, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula, Greece and southern
    Italy. The average streamflow (Q) follows the same behaviour, with negative changes
    in southern Europe (i.e. lower than 40% in southern Spain) as a result of a reduction
    in annual precipitation and increased evapotranspiration.
