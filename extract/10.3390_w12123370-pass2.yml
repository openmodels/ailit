Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes to the stages and characteristics of severe droughts (onset, growth,
    persistence, retreat, duration) in the Canadian Prairies, driven by climate change,
    particularly under high emissions scenarios.
  6: Droughts, characterized by growth, persistence, and retreat stages. Specifically,
    severe droughts exceeding a 45% threshold of grid cells affected. Drought severity
    and intensity, with intensity defined as a combination of duration and severity,
    are also drivers. Rapid retreats of drought conditions sometimes associated with
    severe precipitation events.
  7: Severe historical droughts in the Canadian Prairies.
  9: Increased frequency and severity of droughts due to climate change, influenced
    by different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).
  10: Increase in severe drought frequency and persistence, particularly in future
    scenarios under higher emissions pathways like RCP8.5, potentially affect water
    resources needed for economic activities.
  12: Climate change leading to altered drought patterns, specifically longer and
    potentially more intense droughts, particularly under the RCP8.5 scenario.
  13: Increased severity of drought conditions in the future due to climate change,
    as modeled by various GCMs under different RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, and 8.5).
  14: Projected changes to severe drought occurrence and characteristics (frequency,
    persistence, severity, intensity) in the Canadian Prairies, particularly increased
    frequency under higher emission scenarios (RCP 8.5).
  15: Climate change impacting temporal and spatial characteristics of future Canadian
    Prairie severe droughts.
Highlights:
  1: The study projects an increase in severe drought occurrence, particularly toward
    the end of the century with a high emissions scenario. Overall drought duration
    and intensity is projected to increase due to longer persistence stages.
  6: The 1917-1920 drought was the most intense. The 1930s were a severe drought decade.
    Central Alberta and west-central Saskatchewan were regions of most extreme SPEI
    values.
  7: The table identifies the most extreme values for each drought characteristic
    and provides median, 25th, and 75th percentile values for each variable.
  9: Future droughts may exhibit faster growth (flash droughts).
  10: Future scenarios, especially under RCP8.5, show increased median and variability
    of severe droughts, indicating higher risk of economic impact due to greater drought
    frequency and duration.
  12: Severe droughts are projected to be longer in the future, primarily due to greater
    persistence. Drought intensity is scenario-dependent in the far future, with RCP8.5
    showing much more intense values. The average of GCMs considerably underestimates
    the percentage of severe droughts peaking during the growing season.
  13: Central Saskatchewan is projected to experience significant drought-related
    concerns, with SPEI differences reaching up to -0.7 under future climate scenarios.
  14: Severe droughts in the Canadian Prairies are projected to increase in frequency,
    duration, severity, and intensity, particularly under high emission scenarios
    (RCP 8.5), leading to increased economic challenges, especially for agriculture
    and water resource management.
  15: The study provides an innovative assessment of climate change impacts on Canadian
    Prairie severe droughts and the drought-stage methodology can be used to assess
    changes to hydro-climatic extremes in other regions.
Methodology:
  1: The study uses the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index to assess
    historical (1900-2014) and projected future changes to severe drought occurrence
    across the agricultural region of the Canadian Prairies, using 29 global climate
    models (GCMs) with three representative concentration pathways.
  6: "Analysis based on the percentage of grid cells in severe drought or worse (SPEI\
    \ < -1.5) during the 12-month agricultural year (September to August) from 1900\u2013\
    2014. Severity assessed using SPEI values. Intensity is defined as a combination\
    \ of duration and severity."
  7: "The study analyzes observed severe historical droughts over the Canadian Prairies\
    \ for the period 1900\u20132014."
  9: Climate models (29 GCMs) are used to project the average number of severe droughts
    per decade under different RCP emission pathways (2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) for near
    (2021-2060) and far future (2061-2100) periods, compared to a historical period.
  12: The analysis uses General Circulation Model (GCM) projections under various
    Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to assess future drought characteristics.
    It compares these projections to historical data (CANGRD) and examines changes
    in drought severity, intensity, and spatial extent. The analysis covers near future
    (2021-2060) and far future (2061-2100) periods.
  13: The study models drought conditions using 29 GCMs under various RCP scenarios
    (2.6, 4.5, 8.5) for near future (2021-2060) and far future (2061-2100) time horizons.
    SPEI is used as the metric to quantify drought severity.
  14: Application of a novel drought stages technique incorporating the SPEI (Standardized
    Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) to examine past and future occurrences
    of severe drought over the agricultural region of the Canadian Prairies. Analysis
    uses CANGRD data from 1900-2014 for historical droughts and 29 CMIP5 GCMs using
    RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.6 for future drought projections. Focus on 12-month
    agricultural growing season.
  15: Innovative assessment of how climate change is projected to affect temporal
    and spatial characteristics of future Canadian Prairie severe droughts, using
    a drought-stage methodology (onset, growth, persistence, retreat, and duration
    stages).
More Notes:
  6: The combined duration of the 1928-1930 and 1931-1932 droughts (38 months) would
    have more severe impacts. Spatial extent of droughts varies, with the driest regions
    usually located in Alberta and Saskatchewan.
  7: The data focuses on the physical characteristics of droughts, not directly on
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. Further analysis would be needed to link these
    drought characteristics to economic impacts.
  9: CANGRD data is used for observed drought frequency.
  12: The study focuses on the Prairies region. The differences between CANGRD and
    the average modelled projections regarding the timing of peak drought severity
    require further investigation. The historical ensemble underestimates drought
    intensity when compared to actual observed intensity.
  13: The analysis focuses on a specific region of Canada, visualizing drought projections
    based on climate models and RCP scenarios.
  14: The projected drought changes are based on median projections from 29 GCMs,
    with considerable variability in individual model results. The analysis uses a
    specific drought stages concept based on specified thresholds, and other methodologies
    may yield different results.
  15: "Historical simulations from many GCMs underestimated the number of severe droughts\
    \ during 1900\u20132005 and the length of growth and retreat shoulder stages,\
    \ adding to uncertainty in future projections. Future research should address\
    \ this underestimation."
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Decreased agricultural production and hydro-electric power generation and increased
    freshwater transportation costs are listed as potential economic effects of droughts.
  6: Longer drought events tend to cause greater losses as storage of water and other
    adaptive resources are depleted.
  9: No relevant information
  12: This paper explores the projected changes in drought characteristics (duration,
    severity, and intensity) in the Prairies region, which could indirectly impact
    macroeconomic outcomes related to agricultural productivity and regional economic
    stability.
  13: Drought-related concerns, especially for sectors such as agriculture.
  14: Economic impacts, especially for sectors such as agriculture and water resource
    management.
  15: Understanding of future drought impacts and the development of potential adaptation
    strategies.
Quantitative material:
  6: The ten severe droughts identified exceeded a 45% threshold of grid cells affected.
    Median retreat stage is five months. Median drought duration is 19.5 months, with
    some lasting 15 months or less and others 29-32 months. Drought severities mostly
    ranged from -0.89 to -1.47, with a median of -1.36.
  7: "Table 3 provides data on the characteristics of observed severe historical droughts\
    \ over the Canadian Prairies for the period 1900\u20132014, including onset month,\
    \ growth (months), persistence (months), peak intensity (% of average), retreat\
    \ (months), termination month, duration (months), severity, and intensity. Median,\
    \ 25th, and 75th percentile values are provided for each variable."
  9: "In the far future (2061\u20132100) with median values of 0.92, 1.33, and 1.68/decade\
    \ for RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, respectively."
  12: The paper presents percentages of severe droughts peaking during the growing
    season under different RCPs, as well as median severity and intensity values for
    droughts. It includes quantitative comparisons between modelled historical data
    and observed data (CANGRD).
  13: SPEI differences between modelled droughts and observed CANGRD droughts range
    up to -0.7, particularly in central Saskatchewan.
  14: Doubling of severe drought occurrences by the end of the century with RCP 8.5.
    Severe drought durations are projected to increase by about half a year for the
    near future, and almost a year for the far future using RCP 8.5.
