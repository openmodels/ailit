Highlights:
  1: "Climate change may dramatically reduce GDP in most regions, with India, Brazil,\
    \ and the South Asian Pacific suffering long-term catastrophic damages. Carbon\
    \ taxation, coupled with region- and generation-specific transfers, can correct\
    \ the carbon externality and raise welfare. Carbon taxes set at carbon\u2019s\
    \ marginal social cost do far too little to mitigate climate change unless all\
    \ major emitters, particularly China, adopt them immediately."
  2: Absent policy, climate change will generally undermine economic growth, but differentially
    by region. Carbon taxation, coupled with interregional and intergenerational redistribution,
    can substantially limit the damage while making everyone better off.
  3: Global carbon taxation can significantly mitigate losses from climate change,
    but atmospheric carbon concentration is already so high that the optimal UWI carbon
    tax policy can only limit peak global damages by 44.3 percent.
  6: No relevant information
  7: Optimal paths of carbon taxation and UWI welfare gains are barely changed by
    slower transitions to full substitutability of clean and dirty energy.
  10: Regional TFP peaks at an optimal temperature (T*), with cold regions potentially
    benefiting from warming and hot regions facing harm as temperatures deviate from
    T*.
  12: China's carbon emissions are twice that of the US and three times that of Western
    Europe, primarily due to its high dependence on coal.
  13: Table 4 depicts productivity growth rate differentials relative to the US productivity
    growth rate, applied through 2100.
  14: Global mean temperature increases significantly under BAU scenarios. Damages
    can be extraordinarily large for the world as a whole and for specific regions,
    particularly India. Russia and Canada may experience gains from climate change
    due to their initial low temperatures. Lower damages result in higher GDP and
    thus higher emissions which increase warming.
  15: Global peak GDP loss in the 6x case is close to 17 percent. Under BAU, oil,
    gas, and coal production will definitively end worldwide in 200 years. By 2100,
    China and India account for almost 40 percent of world GDP (with or without climate
    policy).  The global interest rate falls to 2.9 percent by the end of the century
    from its initial 4.0 percent value under BAU.
  16: Optimal initial carbon taxes are extremely sensitive to the damage function;
    UWI carbon policy can achieve a major win-win for all humanity; maximal global
    temperature and maximal regional damages are substantially reduced by carbon taxation.
  17: "Optimal carbon taxes accelerate after 60 years, reaching very high levels after\
    \ 100 years. A simple, time-invariant growth in the carbon tax suffices to produce\
    \ the vast majority of any policy\u2019s welfare impacts. UWI policy makes everyone\
    \ better off but comes at a very high net tax cost to some low-income regions.\
    \ The UWIL policy caps net taxes, leading to more uniform welfare gains."
  18: Figure 7 shows that uniform welfare improvement (UWI) and UWIL policies are
    similar for regions that do not hit the 10 percent limit; some generations enjoy
    much larger welfare gains under UWIL
  19: Carbon taxation aligns with Paris Agreement goals by keeping temperature increase
    within the 2.0-degree limit; Significantly lowers climate damages for nearly all
    regions.
  20: The figure shows total CO2 emissions for different policies as a function of
    time.
  22: Optimal carbon taxes can lead to a marked reduction in the consumption of fossil
    fuels, thereby yielding long-term benefits for future generations.
  23: Future generations in regions such as India, BRA, SAP, MENA, SLA, and SSA may
    need to transfer significant portions of their future consumption.
  24: India's share of world output in 2100 is affected by carbon policy, with a share
    of 6.43% under UWI policy versus 5.38% without.
  25: Substitutability between clean and dirty energy significantly affects carbon
    damages; green-for-dirty substitution influences optimal tax levels over time.
  26: Only China and the US show significant regional social cost of carbon (SCC)
    in the 6x damage scenario BAU case.
  27: Key outcomes include the necessity of global carbon taxation for effectiveness
    and the effects of delayed implementation on welfare gains.
  28: Absent policy, climate change leads to substantial GDP losses, particularly
    in India. A compensatory carbon tax policy can achieve a win-win for all cohorts.
    The redistributive aspect of UWI policy may be unenforceable, leading the authors
    to explore UWIF and UWIL policies, which provide welfare gains while addressing
    time consistency issues. The UWIL policy significantly reduces climate damage
    and shortens fossil fuel usage.
  29: SCC is high for regions with high total GDP, notably CHI and USA; in the optimal
    cases, the tax on carbon equals the SCC; dramatic effect of the taxes on coal
    use.
  30: The social cost of carbon varies significantly across regions, scenarios, and
    time periods, with generally increasing costs over time. Some regions, like Russia
    and Eastern Europe, show negative social costs of carbon in some scenarios.
  32: The model aims to derive the largest UWI (Uniform Welfare Increase) carbon tax
    policy, aiming for Pareto-efficient outcomes by using the LSRA.
  33: The social cost of carbon generally increases over time and with higher CO2
    emissions scenarios. The global social cost of carbon is significantly higher
    than regional estimates. There is variation in social cost of carbon across regions
    and scenarios.
  35: The figure shows gas consumption under different policies over time.
  36: Fig. 16 shows the impact of different policies on coal consumption over time.
Methodology:
  1: Large-scale, annually calibrated, multi-region, overlapping generations model
    of climate change and carbon policy; phased impact of emissions on global and
    regional temperature calibrated to latest scientific evidence.
  2: Large-scale, multi-region, overlapping generations (OLG) model featuring 18 regions
    and 80 overlapping generations. Calibrated to UN data, with output produced using
    capital, labor, and dirty/clean energy. The model connects carbon emissions to
    atmospheric carbon concentration and mean global temperature.
  3: Large-scale OLG integrated assessment model (IAM) with region-specific emissions
    and damages. The model determines region-specific temperatures based on a climate-science
    technique called 'pattern scaling'. The study also handles key feedbacks, including
    the relationship between global and region-specific temperatures, the impact of
    region-specific temperatures on region-specific damages, the impact of region-specific
    damages on region-specific production, the impact of changing region-specific
    production on region-specific emissions, and the sum of regional emissions determining
    global emissions and, thus, global temperature.
  6: The paper develops a dynamic economic assessment model with region-specific firms
    and households to analyze climate change impacts. Firms produce final output using
    capital, labor, and energy (both clean and dirty). The model includes equations
    for profit maximization in both final output and clean energy production. A competitive
    equilibrium is defined, and a climate emulator is used. The model is solved using
    a computational method described in Section 3.5 and Appendix A.3.
  7: The model incorporates a CES function for dirty energy consumption using oil,
    gas, and coal, with an elasticity of substitution parameter. It models cost minimization
    for energy production, considering both clean and dirty energy sources. Dirty
    energy extraction costs increase with cumulative extraction, approaching infinity
    as reserves deplete.
  8: The analysis uses a general equilibrium model with overlapping generations of
    agents who make decisions about consumption, labor supply, and asset accumulation.
    The model includes dirty energy production, land use, and carbon policy instruments.
    The model is calibrated using UN demographic projections.
  9: The paper uses pattern scaling to infer regional temperatures from global temperature,
    based on large-scale Earth system models.
  10: "The analysis uses pattern scaling to calculate region-specific temperatures,\
    \ and evaluates climate impacts through a model that accounts for temperature-dependent\
    \ damages to regional total factor productivity (TFP), using the CCSM4 model under\
    \ RCP8.5 and a Gauss\u2013Seidel iteration technique."
  12: The analysis includes normalizing energy prices and using region-specific parameters
    to determine energy costs and consumption, as well as assumptions on shares of
    output paid to capital and labor.
  13: "Country-specific regressions from M\xFCller et al.(2019) are aggregated to\
    \ generate regional productivity growth rates relative to the US productivity\
    \ growth rate; applied through 2100."
  14: The paper uses a 'Krusell-Smith' type productivity function to model the impact
    of temperature changes. The analysis is performed under various damage scenarios
    (2x, 4x, and 6x) and carbon policy scenarios. The timeframe extends to 200 years
    into the future.
  15: A climate emulator is calibrated to the multi-model mean of CMIP5 simulations.
    The damage function is varied, with 1x, 2x, 4x, and 6x damage scenarios considered.
    The model projects out 200 years.
  16: The analysis uses different damage specifications (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x) and compares
    scenarios with and without transfers (UWI, UWIF, UWIL) to analyze the impact of
    carbon policies.
  17: The analysis is performed using a model that simulates the effects of carbon
    taxation and wealth transfers under different damage scenarios. Results are applicable
    for future generations and the next 50 years regarding tax growth.
  19: The analysis compares carbon tax policies under different damage specifications
    and examines effects on emissions, temperature, and damages.
  20: The analysis is performed as a function of years, starting from year 0 which
    is 2017, with the 6x damage specification.
  21: The analysis is performed as a function of years and different policies, with
    year 0 on the x-axis being 2017. The x-axis references the year of birth for the
    6x damage specification.
  22: The analysis considers different policies and their impact on regional temperature
    over time.
  24: The paper explores scenarios with a global carbon tax and varying coal reserve
    assumptions to assess economic power shifts among regions.
  25: Consideration of different scenarios, such as infinite coal reserves, substitutability
    rates, and partial international participation to see effects on energy use and
    carbon taxes.
  27: The analysis examines different coalitions' carbon tax policies, with welfare
    gains and emissions studied under various scenarios like delayed implementation.
  28: The study uses a computational general equilibrium model to simulate the impact
    of climate change on GDP and welfare, and to evaluate the effects of different
    carbon tax policies. The time horizon is long enough to consider the eventual
    economic extinction of fossil fuels.
  29: "The paper describes a computational algorithm to solve a series of one-period\
    \ problems to find the optimal carbon tax path, updating each period\u2019s carbon\
    \ tax to that period\u2019s SCC in each iteration."
  30: The table presents model-derived estimates of the social cost of carbon under
    different scenarios and assumptions, applicable to specific regions and time horizons.
  32: "The paper describes a model-based approach using a \"Krusell\u2013Smith\" type\
    \ model and a Lump-Sum Redistribution Authority (LSRA) to determine the optimal\
    \ global carbon tax rate path numerically. It involves iterative steps to solve\
    \ for various economic variables, including global extraction of fossil fuels,\
    \ prices, Lagrange multipliers, and region-specific productivity, while ensuring\
    \ uniform welfare gains across regions. The method involves solving a system of\
    \ 301 equations for 301 variables for each point in time."
  33: The table presents social cost of carbon estimates under different combinations
    of CO2 emissions scenarios (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x relative to some unspecified baseline)
    and climate policy scenarios (BAU, UWI) for specific years (2017, 2025, 2050,
    2100). The underlying modeling framework is not explicitly described on this page.
  34: Guess the optimal carbon tax path based on the SCC in the BAU scenario and iterate
    to find the LSRA solution and new SCC path until convergence.
  35: The analysis presents gas consumption as a function of years under different
    policies, starting from 2017.
  36: The paper models coal consumption under different policies. The 6x damage specification
    is mentioned, but details of the modeling are not on the page.
More Notes:
  1: The paper considers distributional effects of carbon taxation across regions
    and generations.
  2: The model focuses on a uniform welfare improving (UWI) carbon policy, defined
    as the policy that delivers the highest uniform welfare gain to all cohorts. The
    worst-case scenario is viewed as particularly salient since the deterministic
    model ignores particularly damaging climate shocks.
  3: The UWI policy taxes carbon emissions at time-varying rates equal to the social
    cost of carbon and lump-sum redistributes (compensates) on a generation- and region-specific
    basis to ensure that all cohorts in all regions experience an identical welfare
    gain.
  6: The model includes region-specific total factor productivity (TFP), capital and
    labor shares, and clean-energy production parameters.
  7: The model includes equations for determining energy demands (oil, gas, coal),
    dirty energy composite price, clean energy production, and conditions for fossil
    fuel use ending. The model also incorporates finite energy reserves and extraction
    costs for dirty energy producers, which increase with cumulative extraction.
  10: The 'handshake' between climate and economics in this model occurs at the temperature-dependent
    damage level to TFP, which is a core component of the analysis.
  12: No additional relevant notes.
  13: The paper uses UN population projections to calibrate population dynamics; Calibrates
    globally available reserves of oil, gas, and coal based on McGlade and Ekins (2015);
    Parameters for the climate block are adopted from Folini et al. (2024); Initial
    distribution of assets between generations and regions is taken from Benzell et
    al.(2017).
  14: The paper considers carbon policies that are not Pareto-efficient, but that
    might arise in the political process.
  15: Higher damages limit output and thus emissions. The RCP6.0 scenario seems more
    relevant for forecasting emissions absent policy. The BAU emissions path falls
    between the RCP6.0 and RCP4.5 scenarios, representing a relatively optimistic
    path. Brazil is the first region to end the use of all fossil fuels in 2045, while
    the US ends in 2105 and China in 2092.
  16: The analysis considers the impact of carbon policies on global interest rates
    and welfare gains across generations and regions; it also highlights the potentially
    large transfers from future generations required under UWI policy.
  17: The effectiveness of optimal carbon taxation is highly dependent on whether
    and how the efficiency gains from taxing carbon are distributed. Early generations
    in some regions are harmed by SCC-based carbon taxation absent wealth transfers.
  18: Carbon taxes are lump-sum rebated to dirty-energy companies' owners (initial
    generations)
  22: The paper also discusses net transfers paid to successive cohorts based on their
    year of birth (specifically, the age-30 MENA generation in 2017 is referenced).
  24: Carbon tax policy alone is suggested to have a potentially significant but not
    overwhelming impact on the share of global GDP for regions experiencing climate
    change effects.
  28: 'The paper focuses on the distributional effects of climate change and carbon
    tax policies across regions and generations. It introduces three policy options:
    UWI, UWIF, and UWIL, each designed to improve welfare outcomes under climate change.'
  29: The model projects population declines in almost all regions, with the exceptions
    of the US, CND, SSA, and ANZ, where population is projected to increase over the
    next 100 years and then remain constant.
  30: BAU likely refers to Business As Usual; UWI likely refers to an alternative
    scenario, though its details are not present on this page. "1x case" to "6x case"
    likely refer to different multiples of some baseline quantity or condition.
  31: The y-axis is population in thousands and the x-axis is years.
  32: The model takes into account regional land and labor supply, world capital supply,
    and reserves of oil, gas, and coal.
  33: The acronyms for the regions (BRA, MEX, SAF, MENA, SLA, SSA, SOV, GBR, ANZ)
    are provided but the specific countries included in those regional aggregations
    are not provided on this page. The page does not explain what the "1x", "2x",
    "4x", "6x" refer to quantitatively, nor what baselines or other model assumptions
    are being employed.
  36: The page focuses on the impact of policies on coal consumption, rather than
    direct climate impacts such as mortality or productivity loss. The reference list
    suggests the paper likely uses economic modeling.
Quantitative material:
  1: Welfare gains of 4.3% from carbon taxation with region- and generation-specific
    transfers; 4.0% or higher welfare gain with a carbon tax-cum-redistribution policy
    that limits burden for any generation in any region to less than 10% on a consumption-equivalent
    basis.
  2: Under a high-damage calibration scenario, an initial $87.5 carbon tax rising
    annually at 1.4 percent, coupled with appropriate cohort- and region-specific
    transfers, limits global damages in 2100 by 38 percent.
  3: "Under BAU, the planet's mean surface temperature will rise by approximately\
    \ 3.1 degrees Celsius through 2100. Relative to a world with no carbon-based damage,\
    \ climate change lowers their 2100 GDP levels by 38.6, 33.4, 33.0, and 30.9 percent\
    \ for India, the South Asian Pacific, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and\
    \ North Africa, respectively. Global GDP is reduced by 14.7 percent in 2100. Optimal\
    \ UWI policy ends all dirty energy usage by 2103 and dramatically reduces cumulative\
    \ (2017 through fossil fuel\u2019s end date) oil, gas, and coal consumption by\
    \ 84.4 percent, 86.2 percent, and 98.1 percent, respectively. This limits the\
    \ rise in the global mean surface temperature to 2.1 degrees Celsius. The peak\
    \ global GDP loss declines from 16.7 percent to 9.3 percent. Peak regional damages\
    \ now range from 0.5 percent to 27.8 percent of GDP compared with the range from\
    \ 2.1 percent to 43.9 under BAU. Optimal UWI gain is 4.3 percent, measured as\
    \ a consumption compensating variation."

    \ CHI 2.54%."
  14: Global mean temperature increases range from 3.7 to 4.4 degrees Celsius over
    the next 200 years under BAU. Global damages peak at almost 17 percent of world
    output in the 6x damage scenario. India's damages reach over 40 percent of GDP
    by 2200. Damages in the US, China, and Japan/South Korea/Hong Kong exceed 16 percent
    of output by 2200. Climate gains peak above 3.9 percent for Russia and 2.6 percent
    of GDP for Canada. GBR experiences small damages, peaking at just 2.1 percent
    of GDP.

  25: BAU scenario with infinite coal reserves increases carbon damages by 2.8% of
    global GDP between years 75 and 300; UWI gain is 5.5% versus 4.3% in baseline;
    optimal tax trajectory differs with high emissions scenarios and elastic coal
    supply.
  26: Regional SCC for 2017 is $10.58 for India and $3.12 for Brazil; the global SCC
    is $111.69.
  27: Quantitative results include welfare gains and increases in emissions ranging
    from varying percent changes, such as a $100 Chinese-only carbon tax causing a
    17% increase in other regions' emissions.
  28: Under a high damage scenario, peak GDP losses reach 43.9% in India, exceeding
    30% for SSA, SLA, MENA, BRA, and SAP, and 17.1% for the US. Russia and Canada
    experience peak output gains of 3.9% and 2.6%, respectively, under BAU. An optimal
    UWI policy yields a 4.3% uniform welfare gain. A UWIF policy provides a 7.7% welfare
    gain for future generations. Under UWIL, the carbon tax starts at $91.4 per ton
    of CO2, rising at roughly 1.5% per year. Peak temperature rise under UWIL policy
    is 2.1 degrees Celsius, with peak global damages at 9.2% of GDP. For India, damages
