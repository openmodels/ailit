Drivers of Risk:
  1: The phased impact of emissions on global and regional temperature affects climate
    change outcomes.
  3: Carbon emissions leading to increased global mean surface temperature, region-specific
    temperatures and damages impacting region-specific production.
  4: Climate change (global temperature increases and related productivity declines);
    Delay in carbon tax implementation (Green Paradox); Pace of substitutability between
    clean and dirty energy; Coal supply curve (finite vs infinite); Carbon taxation
    policies (UWI, UWIF, UWIL); Participation of regions in carbon taxation policies
    (especially China).
  6: Region-specific total factor productivity (TFP), Region- and time-specific productivity
    level in clean energy sector.
  7: "Prices of oil (\U0001D45D\U0001D442\U0001D461), gas (\U0001D45D\U0001D43A\U0001D461\
    ), and coal (\U0001D45D\uE22F\U0001D461); Extraction costs of dirty energy (\U0001D450\
    \U0001D440\U0001D461(\U0001D445\U0001D440\U0001D461)); Carbon taxes (\U0001D70F\
    \U0001D461+\U0001D457)."
  8: Carbon policy (taxes and rebates), which affects dirty energy production and
    prices.
  10: Regional average surface temperatures, modeled via pattern scaling based on
    global average temperature changes, drive regional TFP changes.
  11: The study couples a climate emulator to a global general equilibrium model (GGM),
    suggesting climate change impacts drive the risks.
  13: The paper identifies changes in regional productivity growth rates and possible
    future scenarios of global mean temperature change as drivers of risk.
  14: Increases in global mean temperature due to climate change, damage function
    specification (low, medium, high damage scenarios).
  15: Damage function shape; Calibration of climate emulator; Potential understatement
    of fossil-fuel reserves or overstatement of extraction costs; Faster clean-energy
    productivity growth.
  16: Different damage function specifications (1x to 6x); Carbon policies (carbon
    tax with and without Universal Welfare Improvement (UWI) transfers); Level of
    carbon tax; Redistribution policies
  17: The shocks impacting outcomes include varying levels of climate change damage
    (1x to 6x damage scenarios) and the structure of carbon tax and transfer schemes.
  18: Policy choices related to carbon taxes and green energy investment.
  19: Climate damages are heterogeneous across regions, ranging from huge in India
    to negative in Russia and Canada.
  22: Carbon taxes and their impact on consumption of fossil fuels.
  23: Climate change (absent mitigation)
  24: Climate change damages ('6x damage scenario'), carbon tax policy (BAU vs. Optimal)
  25: Coal supply elasticity, substitutability of clean for dirty energy, partial
    international participation in carbon tax policy
  26: Climate change damage (specifically a '6x damage scenario'); Use of dirty vs
    clean energy; Regional tax on emissions
  28: Climate change (specifically absent policy), fossil fuel usage.
  29: No relevant information
  34: Different policy interventions related to carbon taxes, as they impact oil consumption.
  36: Different policies (unspecified)
Highlights:
  1: Carbon taxation, along with region-specific transfers, can correct the carbon
    externality and enhance welfare broadly; however, achieving uniform welfare gains
    could require high compensatory payments for future generations.
  2: Carbon taxation with appropriate transfers can substantially limit climate damage;
    different impacts across regions
  3: Global carbon taxation can significantly mitigate losses from climate change,
    although atmospheric carbon concentration is already so high that the optimal
    UWI carbon tax policy can only limit peak global damages by 44.3%. The optimal
    UWI policy is equivalent to increasing annual consumption of each cohort by 4.3%
    under BAU.
  4: China's participation in carbon policy is essential for real progress against
    climate change. Delaying carbon tax implementation significantly reduces its effectiveness
    (Green Paradox). Carbon taxation has little effect on the long-term distribution
    of global GDP shares. The study considers the impact of different damage functions
    on different regions.
  7: The optimal paths of carbon taxation and UWI welfare gains are barely changed
    by the speed of the transition to full clean/dirty energy substitutability, even
    though the short and medium-term use of dirty energy, particularly coal, is greater
    the slower the transition to full substitutability.
  10: Some regions may benefit from global warming if their temperatures are below
    an optimal level, while hotter regions will be harmed; The Social Cost of Carbon
    (SCC) is defined as the present discounted value of future damages from an additional
    unit of CO2 emitted at time t.
  11: 'The model disaggregates the world into 18 regions. Energy consumption data
    is split into four composites: coal, gas, oil, and clean energy.'
  13: Regions have varying productivity growth rates relative to the US, with significant
    positive growth in regions like China and India.
  14: Absent carbon policy, the planet's average temperature will rise by 3.7 to 4.4
    degrees Celsius over the next 200 years. Damages can be extraordinarily large
    for the world as a whole, but particularly for specific regions such as India
    (40% GDP loss). Lower damages in some scenarios mean higher GDP and, thus, higher
    emissions.
  15: Magnitude of global damages is highly sensitive to the shape of the upper tail
    of the damage function; Peak global GDP loss in the 6x case is close to 17%; BAU
    emissions fall between RCP6.0 and RCP4.5 scenarios; China and India account for
    almost 40 percent of world GDP by 2100; Global interest rate falls under BAU.
  16: UWI carbon policy can achieve a major win-win for all humanity; Optimal initial
    carbon taxes are extremely sensitive to the damage function; The UWI case entails
    extremely large transfers from future generations in regions hardest hit by climate
    change
  17: Under the 6x damage scenario, optimal carbon taxes are very high ($700+ in no-transfer
    cases) with a small difference in welfare gains between time-varying and fixed
    growth rates. The UWI policy resulted in a 4.3% welfare gain. Regional differences
    exist in welfare gains; India and other low-income regions incur high net tax
    costs.
  18: Significant welfare gains for many region-specific future generations exist
    and can be shared.
  19: Carbon taxation can dramatically reduce regional climate damage; the reduction
    is almost 50 percent for almost all regions.
  21: The figure presents welfare gains as a function of years and different policies.
  22: Optimal carbon taxes can lead to significant economic implications and may require
    compensating current generations to avoid welfare losses.
  23: Under the UWI policy, some regions (e.g., India) may experience significant
    consumption losses (up to 40% for those born in 200 years) due to required transfers
    to service carbon-policy debt, despite being poorer regions.
  24: "China is projected to eclipse the US economically regardless of carbon policy.\
    \ India's share of world output is significantly impacted by carbon policy. Without\
    \ carbon policy, WEU's global GDP share surpasses the US share by almost 1.5 percentage\
    \ points by the century\u2019s end, but the gap drops to roughly half with carbon\
    \ policy."
  25: Infinite coal reserves increase damages and the potential gains from climate
    policy. Imperfect substitutability of clean for dirty energy reduces the gains
    from climate policy and leads to lower optimal carbon taxes. Partial international
    participation in carbon tax policy has limited effects, especially if only smaller
    regions participate. China's participation has a larger impact due to its coal-intensive
    technology.
  26: Regional taxes have a relatively small impact on emissions and warming. Partial
    participation in emissions reduction efforts is problematic. Welfare gains from
    optimal regional taxes and transfers are not easily achieved. Regional SCC is
    only significant in China and the US under the 6x damage scenario BAU case.
  28: Absent policy, climate change could lead to substantial GDP losses, particularly
    in India (43.9%). A compensatory carbon tax policy (UWIL) can achieve welfare
    gains for all cohorts (4.0% or higher) while limiting the tax burden on future
    generations. The UWIL policy also reduces global temperature rise and fossil fuel
    usage.
  29: The dramatic effect of taxes on coal use is notable.
  33: The social cost of carbon is projected to increase significantly over time,
    particularly under higher climate sensitivity scenarios (4x, 6x). The SCC varies
    substantially across regions, with MENA and the Global aggregate generally showing
    higher values. The choice of scenario ('BAU' or 'UWI') impacts the SCC, with notable
    differences becoming apparent in later years (2050, 2100).
  34: The analysis examines the impact of different policies on oil consumption over
    time.
Methodology:
  1: Develops a large-scale, annually calibrated, multi-region, overlapping generations
    model of climate change and carbon policy.
  2: Large-scale, multi-region, overlapping generations (OLG) model calibrated to
    UN data; considers 18 regions
  3: Large-scale OLG integrated assessment model (IAM) with region-specific emissions
    and damages; uses pattern scaling to determine region-specific temperatures; incorporates
    feedbacks between temperatures, damages, production, and emissions. Relies on
    Krusell and Smith (2022)'s damage function (calibrated) and Folini et al. (2024)'s
    climate modeling.
  4: The study uses a model to simulate the effects of carbon taxation and climate
    change under different policy scenarios and assumptions about energy supply and
    substitutability.
  6: Computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with region-specific representative
    firms and households; focuses on Pareto efficiency; uses a climate emulator.
  7: The model formulates energy production and consumption with a Constant Elasticity
    of Substitution (CES) function between dirty energy sources (oil, gas, coal).
    Clean and dirty energy substitutability can increase gradually. Dirty energy producers
    maximize market value subject to resource constraints. Cost minimization dictates
    the demand for dirty energy. Lagrangian multipliers are used to deal with periods
    of zero dirty energy consumption.
  8: The paper develops a general equilibrium model with overlapping generations to
    analyze the effects of carbon policy. The model includes dirty energy production,
    land use, and household behavior with idiosyncratic mortality risk and an actuarially
    fair annuities market. Equilibrium conditions are defined for various markets,
    including energy, land, and capital. Debt is issued to finance carbon policy.
  9: 'The paper adopts the functional form of DICE (Nordhaus, 2017) to model the climate
    but uses a parameterization proposed by Folini et al. (2024). DICE mimics the
    carbon cycle via three carbon reservoirs: the atmosphere (A), the upper ocean
    (U), and the lower ocean (L).'
  10: The model uses a Gauss-Seidel iteration technique to solve for the evolution
    of temperature and damages for different emissions paths; the model is solved
    backward from a steady state assumed to be reached in 3017.
  11: The paper uses an 18-region overlapping generations (OLG) model, based on the
    Global Gaidar Model (GGM), coupled with a climate emulator. Calibration relies
    on World Bank Development Indicators (WDI) and US Energy Information Administration
    (EIA) data.
  13: "The analysis relies on regional productivity growth projections and calibrations\
    \ based on M\xFCller et al. (2019), UN population data, and energy reserves calibration\
    \ for evaluating macro-fiscal outcomes."
  14: "Simulation of a model with different damage-function specifications (based\
    \ on 'Krusell-Smith' productivity functions) under a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario.\
    \ The analysis is performed over a 200-year horizon. Considers alternative carbon\
    \ policies. UWI policy, as indicated, uniformly allocates efficiency gains to\
    \ all current and future cohorts in all regions. Our UWIF policy reprises our\
    \ UWI policy but restricts the uniform welfare gains to only future generations;\
    \ all current generations receive their BAU utility levels. Our UWIL policy runs\
    \ UWI under the restriction that the lifetime net tax payment of any generation\
    \ in any region is limited to 10 percent of that region-specific generation\u2019\
    s lifetime consumption."
  15: Uses a climate emulator calibrated to the multi-model mean of CMIP5 simulations;
    Four different damage scenarios (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x damage specification).
  16: The paper uses a model to assess the impact of carbon policies (carbon tax with
    and without UWI transfers) under different damage function specifications; SCC-determined
    carbon-tax paths
  17: The paper uses simulation results to assess the impacts of various carbon tax
    scenarios over time with scenarios including no transfers, UWI, UWIF, and UWIL
    policies.
  18: Analysis of welfare gains under different policy scenarios (implied).
  19: The paper uses a model with a 6x damage specification and explores the effects
    of UWIL and UWIF carbon tax policies on emissions and damages.
  21: The analysis considers different policies and their impact on welfare gains
    over time, starting from 2017. The x-axis represents the year of birth for the
    6x damage specification.
  22: Model simulation involving optimal carbon taxes and intergenerational transfers.
  23: The analysis examines the net UWI transfers required by different regions. The
    analysis is performed using a '6x damage specification'. The results are applicable
    to the period starting in 2017 and extending into the future (200 years).
  24: The analysis projects GDP shares under different scenarios of climate change
    damage and carbon policy, implicitly using a computational general equilibrium
    model to determine the impact of climate change and carbon policy on different
    regions.
  25: The analysis uses a model with different scenarios for coal supply elasticity
    (infinite vs. baseline), substitutability of clean for dirty energy (perfect vs.
    gradual transitions), and international participation in carbon tax policy (global
    vs. regional). The model incorporates a CES function to represent the substitutability
    of clean and dirty energy. Regional carbon taxes are explored with revenue redistribution
    within participating regions.
  26: Analysis based on a '6x damage scenario' case, considering imperfect substitutability
    of dirty and clean energy in the short and medium run. Uses 'different policies'
    in the analysis.
  28: The analysis uses a model to simulate the effects of climate change and different
    carbon tax policies on regional GDP and welfare. It considers a 'high damage scenario'
    and explores the impacts of UWI, UWIF, and UWIL policies (uniform welfare improvement,
    uniform welfare improvement for future generations only, and uniform welfare improvement
    with limited taxes, respectively). The time horizon extends to 2200. A nine-decade
    transformation to clean energy is considered.
  29: "The paper uses a computational model that recursively solves a series of one-period\
    \ problems to find the optimal carbon tax path, updating each period\u2019s carbon\
    \ tax to that period\u2019s SCC in each iteration. The algorithm involves backward\
    \ induction."
  34: An iterative process involving guessing the optimal carbon tax path, finding
    the LSRA solution, calculating the new equilibrium SCC path, updating the carbon
    tax path based on the new SCC path, and iterating until convergence.
  36: The analysis uses a '6x damage specification'.
More Notes:
  2: The paper discusses a Uniform Welfare Improvement (UWI) carbon tax policy considering
    various regional damages.
  3: 'The study considers different UWI policies: one that shares efficiency gains
    uniformly (UWI), one that allocates gains solely to future generations (UWIF),
    and one that limits any generation''s net tax to 10 percent of their lifetime
    consumption (UWIL). Carbon tax revenues are lump-sum rebated to dirty energy producers.'
  4: The paper considers the time inconsistency problem associated with carbon tax
    policies (i.e., future generations may choose not to service green bonds).
  6: The model includes region-specific technologies for producing output, dirty energy,
    and capital mobility. The paper discusses a simple institutional setup that can
    facilitate, but not guarantee, compliance.
  7: The paper models dirty energy extraction costs as increasing with cumulative
    extraction and approaching infinity as reserves approach zero.
  9: The model incorporates an international institution (IMF) that coordinates global
    carbon policy and assesses net taxes on generation in each region and year to
    maintain budget balance.
  10: The paper uses GDP-weighted average temperatures to represent regional temperatures.
  11: The model splits the Canada, Australia and New Zealand region of the GGM into
    Canada and ANZ.
  14: The model considers both damages (GDP losses) and gains (GDP increases) from
    climate change. Russia and Canada are projected to experience gains under BAU
    due to their initially low temperatures.
  15: Higher damages limit output and, thus, emissions; RCP8.5 is considered an unlikely
    high-risk future; The BAU transition entails many macroeconomic changes that are
    only partially impacted by climate change.
  16: Net transfers associated with UWI policy entail significant crowding out of
    capital and raise the global interest rate.
  18: Carbon taxes are lump-sum rebated to dirty-energy companies, i.e., to their
    owners, namely initial generations.
  19: The paper finds that even with differing compensation schemes, the rise in global
    temperature stays within or near the 2.0-degree limit set in the Paris Agreement
    due to carbon taxation.
  23: The UWI policy appears to require poorer regions that are highly impacted by
    climate change to subsidize richer regions that are causing a larger share of
    the global externality, as reflected in the relative consumption losses for the
    US vs. India. However, the paper states that Indians would benefit from this policy
    nonetheless.
  24: The presented results are specifically for the '6x damage scenario'. 'Optimal'
    carbon policy here refers to the UWIL policy (Universal Welfare Improvement with
    a Limit), which includes a 10% net tax cap.
  26: The x-axis in Fig. 10 starts in 2017 (year 0).
  28: The paper acknowledges that the redistributive aspect of carbon tax policies
    may be unenforceable due to the high taxes required of future cohorts. The optimal
    path of carbon taxation is little affected by assuming less than perfect substitutability
    in the short- and medium-term of clean for dirty energy. The study suggests that
    even a temporary shock to GDP can have significant welfare implications, especially
    for impoverished regions.
  29: The paper references a GitHub repository with replication codes. The model considers
    region-specific final output paths, final-output factor demands for capital, labor,
    and energy, the world interest-rate path, region-specific paths of wages, region-specific
    paths of energy prices, region-specific clean-energy output paths, region-specific
    clean-energy factor-demand paths for capital and labor, region-specific land rental
    price paths, region-specific usage paths of dirty energy, oil, gas, and coal,
    region-specific dirty energy prices, and region-specific paths of the Lagrange
    multiplier governing dirty energy usage.
  33: The definition of the 'UWI' case is missing, making it difficult to interpret
    the difference between this and the 'BAU' case. The table provides estimates of
    the SCC, which are important for cost-benefit analyses of climate change mitigation
    and adaptation policies. The regions listed are very broad and likely mask significant
    heterogeneity within them. The table does not directly address adaptation, but
    the SCC is a relevant input for assessing the benefits of avoided climate damages
    due to adaptation measures.

  34: Oil consumption.
  36: Coal consumption
Quantitative material:
  1: Carbon taxation and redistribution could raise the welfare of all agents across
    regions by 4.3 percent, and a revised policy could secure a 4.0 percent or higher
    welfare gain.
  2: Initial $87.5 carbon tax rising annually at 1.4% reduces global damages by 38%

    30.9% for India, the South Asian Pacific, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East
    and North Africa, respectively. Global GDP in 2100 is reduced by 14.7%. Optimal
    UWI policy ends dirty energy usage by 2103, reducing oil, gas, and coal consumption
    by 84.4%, 86.2%, and 98.1%, respectively, limiting global mean surface temperature
    rise to 2.1 degrees Celsius. Peak global GDP loss declines from 16.7% to 9.3%.
    Optimal UWI gain is 4.3%, measured as a consumption compensating variation.
  4: "Indian generations born after 2200 face net negative transfers of roughly 40\

    \ in the Middle East, Latin America (excluding Mexico and Brazil), Sub-Saharan\

    \ with the UWIF policy and 39.9 percent with the UWI policy. India\u2019s peak\
    \ welfare gain is 35.6 percent for the generation born in 2285 under UWIL. A coalition\
    \ excluding China adopting a UWI carbon policy has about 60 percent lower uniform\
    \ welfare gain. Delaying carbon tax implementation for 20 years reduces the UWI\
    \ gain by 35 percent to 2.8 percentage points. China's GDP share rises to one-third\
    \ of world GDP by the century's end, while the US falls to 16 percent."
  10: The paper uses the CCSM4 model following the RCP8.5 scenario to derive local
    temperatures; TFP is modeled using a non-linear function based on regional temperature
    relative to an optimal temperature T*.
  11: The paper uses 2017 GDP values and energy consumption data to calibrate the
    model.
  13: Regional productivity growth rates relative to the US are quantified for multiple
    regions.
  14: Global mean temperature increase by 3.7 to 4.4 degrees Celsius over the next
    200 years under BAU. Global damages peak at almost 17 percent of world output
    in the 6x damage scenario. India's damages reach over 40 percent of GDP by 2200
    in the 6x damage scenario. Damages for US, China, Japan/South Korea/Hong Kong
    exceed 16 percent of output by 2200 in the 6x damage scenario. GBR experiences
    damages peaking at 2.1 percent of GDP. Russia and Canada's climate gains peak
    above 3.9 percent and 2.6 percent of GDP, respectively.
  15: Table 5 provides peak GDP losses/gains (%) for various regions under 1x, 2x,
    4x, and 6x damage scenarios, and associated max. global temperature rise; Global
    interest rate falls to 2.9% by end of century from initial 4.0% under BAU.
  16: Optimal initial carbon taxes range from $22.8 to $111.7 per ton CO2 depending
    on the damage specification; Optimal UWI taxes range from $22.4 to $87.5; In the
    6x UWI case, all generations gain 4.3 percent; Without transfers, some generations
    incur losses up to 18.0 percent and others experience gains up to 47.6 percent;
    In the 6x case, Indians born in 200 years would be required under UWI policy to
    surrender more than 40 percent of their consumption
  17: Table contains data on the optimal carbon tax per ton of CO2, average growth
    rate of optimal tax, welfare gains, maximum global temperature rise, maximum global
    damages as a percent of GDP, maximum regional damages as percent of regional GDP,
    and long-run interest rate.

  21: Welfare gains are measured as compensating consumption differentials in percentages,
    plotted on the y-axis.
  22: Figure 5 shows the optimal carbon tax. Figure 4 compares paths of net transfers
    paid to successive cohorts by year of birth.
  23: Indians born in 200 years would be required under the UWI policy to surrender
    around 40 percent of their consumption; Other regions (BRA, SAP, MENA, SLA, and
    SSA) future generations need to transfer more than 20 percent of their consumption.
  24: Table 7 shows projected regional GDP shares of world GDP for 2017, 2050, 2100,
    and 2150 under both Business-as-Usual (BAU) and Optimal carbon tax policies.
  25: BAU infinite coal reserves scenario increases carbon damages between years 75
    and 300 by an additional 2.8% of global GDP. UWI gain in the infinite reserve
    scenario is 5.5% versus 4.3% in the baseline scenario. Optimal tax in the first
    period is reduced to $83.6 per ton of CO2 compared to $87.5 per ton in the baseline
    specification, and over the 100-year horizon, the optimal tax decreases to $448
    per ton compared to $543 per ton in the baseline. In the low-substitution case,
    carbon damages are roughly 12 percent greater at the end of this century and for
    several centuries thereafter. In all scenarios with imperfect substitution, the
    UWI gain is roughly 4.8 percent of GDP. The optimal tax in the low substitutability
    case is $81.5 per ton in the first period and $272 per ton after 100 years. A
    $100 Chinese-only carbon tax, with a 1.5 percent growth rate, lowers initial global
    emissions by roughly one-sixth.
  26: 'Regional SCC for India in 2017: $10.58; Regional SCC for Brazil in 2017: $3.12;
    Global SCC in the 6x damage scenario BAU case: $111.69'
  28: 'Peak GDP regional losses (percentages), carbon tax values ($91.4 per ton of
    CO2 rising at 1.5% per year), temperature rise (degrees Celsius), welfare gains
    (percentages), tax burdens (percentages). Specific values include: India peak
    GDP loss 43.9%, India peak damages under UWIL 27.5%, US peak loss 17.1%, Russia
    gain 3.9%, Canada gain 2.6%, UWI gain 4.3%, UWIF gain 7.7%.'
  29: Table 8 reports GDP, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions by region relative
    to the US in 2017. Table 8 lists values for ANZ, BRA, CND, CHI, EEU, GBR, IND,
    JSHK, MENA, MEX, RUS, SAF, SAP, SLA, SOV, SSA, US, and WEU.
  30: The page contains quantitative data on the social cost of carbon (SCC) in different
    regions, measured in dollars per ton of CO2 for various scenarios and years.
  33: This table presents the social cost of carbon (SCC) in dollars per ton of CO2
    for various regions and years (2017, 2025, 2050, 2100) under different scenarios.
    The scenarios are based on multiples of climate sensitivity (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x) and
    two 'cases,' BAU (business as usual) and UWI (unspecified meaning). Regions include
    Brazil (BRA), Mexico (MEX), South Africa (SAF), Middle East and North Africa (MENA),
    South America (SLA), Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Soviet Union (SOV), Great Britain
    (GBR), Australia/New Zealand (ANZ), and a Global aggregate.
  34: Oil consumption is measured in quad Btu. The x-axis plots years, starting from
    2017.
  36: Figure 16 shows coal consumption (measured in quad Btu) as a function of years
    with year 0 being 2017.
