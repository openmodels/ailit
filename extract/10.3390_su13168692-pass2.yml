Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change is expected to heighten risks for livelihoods in agricultural
    marginal areas.
  7: Climate shocks, limited resource base, harsh climatic factors, lack of affordable
    and low-input technology suitable for marginal lands, focus on input-responsive
    crops, failure of modern varieties to diffuse into agro-climates.
  8: Climate change shocks (droughts, soil degradation, salinity, heatwaves), competition
    for scarce natural resources (land and water), biophysical stresses on natural
    resources, environmental stresses (salinization, waterlogging, fertilizer contamination,
    soil erosion).
  9: Climate change, biodiversity loss, biophysical and socio-economic constraints
    in marginal areas, environmental degradation, technological issues
  10: Environmental degradation, especially soil quality, and water scarcity impacting
    productivity in marginal areas.
  14: Marginality is influenced by interlinked economic, social, and environmental
    factors.
Highlights:
  1: "The analysis emphasizes the need for a policy framework that is all-inclusive\
    \ and context-specific to address the food\u2013poverty\u2013environment nexus\
    \ in marginal areas."
  7: Conventional policies towards marginal agriculture were conducive to favorable
    areas, neglecting marginal areas and potentially exacerbating regional inequality.
    The Green Revolution strategy, focused on intensification of favorable areas,
    had a limited impact on poverty reduction in marginal production environments.
  8: Marginal agricultural areas have been overlooked in policymaking, hindering poverty
    reduction and economic growth in these regions. Major breakthroughs in productivity-enhancing
    agricultural technologies are essential to reverse resource degradation and put
    marginal lands to optimal use, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa.
  9: Investments in R&D in marginal areas may yield higher social returns than investments
    in high-potential areas; Addressing productivity and poverty problems through
    R&D and public investment in some low-potential areas could offer a win-win strategy.
  10: Introducing bioenergy production and stress-tolerant food crops can increase
    economic returns and food security in marginal areas.
  14: Marginal agriculture plays an important role for the world's poor and remains
    a long-term investment challenge.
Methodology:
  9: Economic analysis of policy options, economic valuation of environmental impacts,
    poverty mapping, GIS techniques, spatially referenced datasets
  14: Systematic review of agricultural marginality and identification of marginal
    areas to guide future research and policies.
More Notes:
  7: The text discusses a historical debate on investment prioritization in agriculture,
    contrasting investment in high-potential vs. marginal areas, and touches upon
    the spillover effects of policies in favorable regions on less-favored areas.
  9: The paper emphasizes the importance of adapting research and development to local
    conditions in marginal areas and focusing on crops and traits important to the
    poor.
  10: Protected agriculture can mitigate production risks and ensure consistent agricultural
    output, aiding subsistence farmers.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  7: Poverty reduction, food security, income, employment, agricultural output.
  8: Poverty alleviation, rural employment, economic growth.
  9: Productivity of agriculture, food security, poverty levels, aggregate social
    returns to a nation
  10: Potential increased productivity and ROI through adoption of stress-tolerant
    crops in marginal areas.
  14: Social returns to investment may be higher in marginal areas than more investment
    in prime areas.
Quantitative material:
  8: 'Global poverty rate: 10% or 734 million people subsisting below USD 1.90 a day.'
  9: Investments in R&D in marginal areas may actually give higher aggregate social
    returns to a nation than additional investments in high-potential and prime areas
