Drivers of Risk:
  2: The primary driver of risk examined is changing atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
  4: Declining foliar nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations, changes in atmospheric
    N and P depositions, and limitations in water availability are identified as drivers
    impacting GPP.
  5: Water availability (represented by terrestrial water storage (TWS)) is a key
    driver.  Also, nitrogen and phosphorus availability.
  7: Limiting effects of plant nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus on the carbon
    fertilization effect (CFE).
Evaluation overview:
  2: This paper evaluates the global temporal trend of the light use efficiency parameter
    'b', related to light-saturated photosynthesis per unit CO2.
  4: This paper evaluates Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and its sensitivity to
    increasing CO2 concentrations (represented by 'b').
  5: The paper evaluates terrestrial photosynthesis and land carbon uptake.
  7: Vegetation photosynthesis at the global scale.
Highlights:
  2: The key finding is a declining trend of the light use efficiency parameter 'b'
    globally, which suggests decreasing light-saturated photosynthesis per unit CO2
    with increasing CO2 concentrations. The decreases were notable across all climate
    zones and vegetation types.
  4: TRENDY models likely underestimate the decrease in 'b' inferred from satellite
    datasets. Declining foliar nutrient concentrations and underestimated sensitivity
    of GPP to water availability may explain the divergence between TRENDY models
    and satellite-derived estimates. Areas with declining atmospheric nutrient supplies
    likely had larger decreases in 'b'.
  5: Terrestrial photosynthesis may not increase as much as models project, potentially
    reducing land-based climate mitigation. GPP is more sensitive to water availability
    variations than assumed by TRENDY models. There is a significant and spatially
    extensive decline in carbon fixation efficiency (CFE).
  7: There has been a decline over recent decades in the contribution of CFE to vegetation
    photosynthesis.
Methodology:
  2: The study used linear and nonlinear multiple regression approaches to estimate
    'b' from satellite GPP proxies at each pixel across the globe from 1982 to 2015
    using 15-year moving windows. The Mann-Kendall test was used to estimate the trend
    of 'b' pixel by pixel.
  4: The study used TRENDY GPP data from S2 and S3 scenarios to estimate trends in
    'b' using regression approaches. A linear spatial mixed-effects model was used
    to investigate the relationship between the trend of b and foliar N or P concentrations.
    Analysis was performed using a moving window of 15 years to assess sensitivities
    of GPP to Total Water Storage (TWS) in different climate zones.
  5: The study uses satellite GPP proxies and TRENDY GPP (multi-model mean) with a
    15-year moving window to analyze sensitivity of GPP to TWS in arid, temperate,
    and dry tropical zones.
  7: Explored the temporal dynamics of CFE on vegetation photosynthesis at the global
    scale over recent decades.
More Notes:
  2: Data from eddy covariance flux towers and pixels with large land-cover changes
    were excluded. The authors compared results from satellite GPP proxies, a revised
    EC-LUE GPP, and a multimodel mean GPP determined from the TRENDY v6 ensemble.
  5: The declines in CFE may result from decreased CO2-induced photosynthesis stimulation,
    drought stress, and complex interactions between nutrients, water, and CO2. The
    models fail to adequately detect the sharp declining trend in CFE identified from
    satellite data.
  7: The declining trend of CFE has not been adequately accounted for in carbon cycle
    models, potentially leading to underestimation of future warming.
