Drivers of Risk:
  7: Decline in carbon fertilization effect (CFE) on vegetation photosynthesis, potentially
    due to limiting effects of plant nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus.
Highlights:
  7: There has been a decline over recent decades in the contribution of CFE to vegetation
    photosynthesis. This declining trend has not been adequately accounted for in
    carbon cycle models. CFE has limitations for long-term mitigation of climate change.
Methodology:
  7: Temporal dynamics of CFE on vegetation photosynthesis at the global scale explored.
More Notes:
  7: The paper suggests a source of uncertainty in climate science is how the carbon
    fertilization effect (CFE) will contribute to mitigation of anthropogenic climate
    change.
No relevant information:
  3: This page focuses on the declining trend in the response of Gross Primary Productivity
    (GPP) to increasing atmospheric CO2, a topic relevant to climate change but not
    directly to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level, or the
    costs and benefits of adaptation.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  7: Future warming might currently be underestimated.
