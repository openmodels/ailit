  8: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  6: Size of global cereal reserves (carry-over stocks), grain deficits.
  7: "Variability of food reserves; Changes in relationship between reserves and price;\
    \ Volatility at regional level in terms of grain reserves; El-Ni\xF1o (referenced,\
    \ but not analyzed in this snippet)"
  8: Low levels of cereal stocks in 2007-8 contributed to the 2008 price spike.
  11: No relevant information
  14: No relevant information
  15: Spatial variation in cereal stock from 2005 to 2009, presumably impacted by
    climate-related factors (though not explicitly stated).
  17: Fluctuations in food stock levels impact food prices.
  18: Over-production and collapsing grain prices. Drought or other great calamities.
    Fluctuations in the market price.
  20: Drought, crop failure, soaring prices on local markets, corruption, mismanagement,
    policy shifts (e.g., IMF encouragement to reduce reserve size).
Highlights:
  6: Low grain reserves are linked with higher food prices between 1990 and 2008.
    The relationship between food reserves and price may be changing after 2008.
  7: Grain stocks are significant predictor of price and that stocks and prices are
    inversely correlated between 1991 and 2005, but since 2005 food stocks are not
    significant in explaining price; Country-level reserves may be increasing and
    growing more extreme; Variability of food reserves exists from region to region
    as well as from year to year; Coefficient of variance for cereal reserves has
    risen significantly between 2003 and 2014; Current National Grain Reserves contain
    about 3 months worth of food
  8: Governmental policies, like the Farm Storage Facility Loan Program, may contribute
    to increased grain reserves.
  11: No relevant information
  14: No relevant information
  15: The maps highlight areas with consistent surpluses (e.g., USA) and deficits
    (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa) in cereal stock.
  17: Food stock levels have a statistically significant negative correlation with
    food prices in the periods 1991-2000 and 1995-2005. The regression results for
    the periods 2000-2010 and 2005-2014 are not statistically significant. There is
    high variability in global grain stocks.
  19: CAP successfully met its primary objective of helping the EU become self-sufficient
    from the 1970s onwards, but at the cost of permanent surpluses, high costs, and
    negative impacts on developing countries.
  20: Strategic grain reserves in Africa were designed to address food security and
    market failures but were often undermined by corruption, mismanagement, and policy
    shifts. The Malawi example illustrates how reducing reserves based on IMF recommendations
    combined with corruption can exacerbate famine.
Methodology:
  6: "Analysis based on FAO data of year-end stocks, calculated by adding annual production\
    \ to previous year-end stocks and subtracting yearly utilization and waste. The\
    \ paper also uses the UN\u2019s food price index, which is a weighted average\
    \ of the price of different commodity groups."
  7: Regression analysis (food price as dependent variable, grain stocks as explanatory
    variable) for 1991-2005 and post-2005 periods; Analysis of FAO data on rice/grain
    stocks; Calculation of mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variance for
    grain reserves in four-year intervals between 2003 and 2014
  8: The paper uses USDA data from on- and off-farm surveys to analyze grain storage
    trends in the U.S.
  11: No relevant information
  14: No relevant information
  17: Regression analysis is used to assess the relationship between food price and
    food stock levels for different time periods. Descriptive statistics (mean, SD,
    CV) are calculated for global grain stocks across different time intervals.
  19: Analysis of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and its effects. Results
    applicable from 1957 to present, with a focus on the period from the 1970s to
    the early 1990s.
  20: Describes the strategic grain reserve policy and provides an example of its
    failure in Malawi.
More Notes:
  6: FAO data on grain reserves do not include household-level food storage or food
    held in retail warehouses, which are also important for food system resilience
    but lack available data.
  8: Most food stores are privately owned in the U.S., making comprehensive data analysis
    challenging.
  11: No relevant information
  14: The page presents a figure showing cereal stock variations from 1990-2009, globally
    and for Continental Africa, sourced from FAO (2014). This suggests a focus on
    agricultural impacts of some kind, possibly climate-related.
  15: The figure is limited to cereal stocks between 2005 and 2009 and uses data sourced
    from FAO (2014). The link to climate change and macroeconomic/fiscal outcomes
    is implicit, not directly analyzed here.
  18: The program was inspired by the biblical story of Joseph.
  19: The EU brought in measures to limit surplus, such as fixed quotas on milk production,
    by imposing penalties for over production, and limiting the area of crops or numbers
    of animals.
  20: The success of strategic grain reserves depends heavily on good governance and
    resisting pressures to reduce them for short-term financial gains.

  23: This page focuses on the lack of data regarding household and food supply chain
    storage for resilience and calls for more research on the topic. It does not contain
    information on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes of climate change or adaptation,
    or the costs/benefits of adaptation at a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  6: Food prices.
  7: Market stability (rice price); Resilience of food system
  8: Cereal stocks impacted food prices.
  11: No relevant information
  14: No relevant information
  15: Cereal stock levels provide an indication of national-level food security, which
    can influence macroeconomic stability and government expenditure on food security
    programs.
  17: Food price fluctuations as a function of food stock levels.
  18: The program aimed to support farmers by maintaining fair prices for grains and
    reducing the incentive to oversupply the market, while also ensuring consumers
    had access to affordable food. Government also generated profits from selling
    the stored stocks.
  19: "The EU had to contend with almost permanent surpluses of major commodities.\
    \ CAP grew as a proportion of the EU\u2019s budget. CAP became an extremely expensive\
    \ piece of policy. CAP undermined food security and economic development in Africa."
  20: The strategic grain reserve aims to smooth out volatile prices and prepare for
    food emergencies, potentially impacting price stability and food security.
Quantitative material:
  6: Global cereal reserves ranged between 400 and 600 million tonnes annually (18-23%
    of total annual food use). Largest stock in 2013-14 was 23.3% of utilization.
    Lowest level since early 1990s was 18.4% in 2007-8.
  7: Grain reserves could meet needs for approximately 3 months; Coefficient of variance
    for cereal reserves has risen significantly between 2003 and 2014
  8: Wheat stores have been more variable since the mid-80s but lower in the mid 2000s.
