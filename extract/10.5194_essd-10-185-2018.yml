Drivers of Risk:
  6: Tropical cyclone wind speed (34 kn, 64 kn, 96 kn) and the historical evolution
    of population and assets patterns.
  8: Tropical cyclone (TC) properties, specifically wind speed thresholds (34 kn,
    64 kn, 96 kn) impacting exposed population.
  9: Tropical cyclone exposure
Highlights:
  6: Exposure estimates are sensitive to wind speed thresholds and patterns of population
    and assets. The study also identifies that fast-developing countries' asset values
    might be overestimated for earlier years due to the lack of data on national assets/GDP
    ratios.
  8: Provides a valuable additional resource to the community studying TC-related
    impacts, in particular for non-experts in this field. Avoids present-endogeneity
    issues by creating a TC exposure database based on physical storm properties.
  9: A global historical data set of tropical cyclone exposure data sets (TCE-DAT)
Methodology:
  6: The study uses a global historical data set (TCE-DAT) to estimate tropical cyclone
    exposure based on wind speed thresholds and historical population and asset patterns.
    It compares TCE-DAT estimates with the HURDAText archive for validation, using
    the United States as a test region.  Wind speed is indirectly estimated based
    on minimum central pressure using the Holland08 model.
  8: Creation of a global historical tropical cyclone exposure database (TCE-DAT)
    based on physical storm properties using freely available input data and the CLIMADA
    modeling tool (module ISIMIP). Comparison of exposed population estimates derived
    from the Holland08 wind field model and the observed HURDAText database.
  9: Creation of a global historical data set of Tropical Cyclone Exposure Data (TCE-DAT);
    Harmonization of past GDP observations with future projections according to the
    Shared Socio-economic Pathways
More Notes:
  6: The study acknowledges uncertainties related to socioeconomic data, such as linear
    interpolation between decennial time steps and the approximation of local assets
    using GDP at the grid level.
  8: The dataset aims to provide new insights for global and region-specific vulnerability
    assessments.
  9: The paper acknowledges funding through the Leibniz Competition and thanks Daisuke
    Murakami and Yoshiki Yamagata for improving and adapting their gridded GDP data.
No relevant information:
  4: This page focuses on the creation of a global tropical cyclone exposure dataset
    (TCE-DAT) and the wind field modeling used to generate it. It does not directly
    address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, costs, or benefits of adaptation
    at a national level. The page primarily describes the methodology for estimating
    wind fields associated with tropical cyclones.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  6: Exposed population and exposed assets to tropical cyclones are measured, which
    are then used to infer macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  8: Long-run economic consequences of natural disasters in general.
  9: Continuous national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) time series
Quantitative material:
  6: The page provides graphs illustrating the annual global TC exposure for different
    thresholds of wind speed (34kn, 64kn, 96kn) for population (in billions) and assets
    (in trillion PPP dollars). Pearson correlation of r=0.86 between TCE-DAT and HURDAText
    maximum recorded wind speed.
  8: 'Correlation coefficients (r) for exposed population estimates between HURDAText
    and Holland08 datasets at different wind speed thresholds: r = 0.83 (34 kn), r
    = 0.54 (64 kn), r = 0.75 (96 kn). Box plots indicating exposure in millions of
    people for Holland08 and HURDAText at different wind speed thresholds.'
