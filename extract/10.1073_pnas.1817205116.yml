Drivers of Risk:
  1: Uncertain ice dynamic effects that contribute to sea-level rise
  4: Sea-level rise contributions from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), Greenland
    Ice Sheet (GrIS), and East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) under different temperature
    scenarios (L and H).
Highlights:
  1: Expert uncertainty has grown since the AR5 of the IPCC, requiring adaptation
    planning for a possible 21st-century global total sea-level rise exceeding 2 m.
  4: Uncertainties in ice sheet contributions to SLR are larger than previous assessments
    (BA13, AR5); positive skews in the distributions, with long upper tails, mean
    the median values and upper values of the likely range are statistically significantly
    larger than the corresponding AR5 values;  WAIS and GrIS show strong skew with
    a long positive tail; EAIS uncertainty ranges are smaller than GrIS and WAIS.
    There is a substantial difference between the high-end, 95th percentile values
    considered here versus the 83rd percentile value presented in the AR5.  The median
    values for the GrIS and WAIS are broadly comparable (13/8 cm for L and 23/18 cm
    for H), whereas the EAIS median values are 0 and 2 cm for L and H, respectively.
Methodology:
  1: Structured expert judgement modeling is used to understand correlations between
    intra-ice sheet processes.
  4: Expert elicitation to assess uncertainties in ice sheet contributions to sea-level
    rise, stochastic resampling of distributions assuming a linear relationship between
    low and high temperature scenarios, analysis of probability density functions
    (PDFs).
More Notes:
  1: The analysis finds significant uncertainty in projecting future sea-level rise
    due to ice sheets, which is the largest source of uncertainty in SLR projections
    by a substantial margin.
  4: The paper emphasizes the importance of considering probabilities beyond the likely
    range defined in AR5 (i.e., the 90th percentile confidence interval) when assessing
    SLR risks and that inter-ice sheet dependencies should be taken into consideration.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  4: Implies economic costs associated with sea level rise (SLR) due to ice sheet
    contributions.
Quantitative material:
