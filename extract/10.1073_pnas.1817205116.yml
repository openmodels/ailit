Drivers of Risk:
  1: Uncertain ice dynamic effects are a key driver of risk impacting future sea-level
    rise predictions.
  2: Ice sheet mass balance influenced by accumulation, discharge, and runoff, with
    potential nonlinear instabilities triggered by temperature changes.
  4: The paper discusses the positive skew of distributions and the consideration
    of nonlinear processes affecting sea level rise.
  5: "The primary drivers of risk considered are temperature increases (specifically\
    \ +2\xB0C and +5\xB0C scenarios), external forcing on ice sheets, and processes\
    \ such as Marine Ice Cliff Instability."
  6: The study elicits expert judgments on topics related to sea-level rise, which
    is driven by factors like ice sheet instability.
Evaluation overview:
  1: This page provides an overview of the potential contributions of ice sheets to
    future sea-level rise (SLR) and the associated uncertainties.
  2: The paper provides insights into the uncertainties around ice sheet projections
    using structured expert judgement (SEJ) for future sea level rise (SLR) and associated
    uncertainties.
  4: The paper evaluates sea level rise (SLR) projections by 2100 under different
    temperature scenarios.
  5: The paper focuses on evaluating projections of sea-level rise (SLR) due to ice
    sheet contributions, specifically from Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) and West Antarctic
    Ice Sheet (WAIS).
  6: The paper focuses on quantifying uncertainties in sea-level rise projections.
Highlights:
  1: Findings suggest that expert uncertainty about ice sheet contributions to SLR
    has grown, highlighting scenarios with global total SLR exceeding 2 m for planning
    purposes.
  4: "Key findings include significant uncertainty increase compared to previous assessments,\
    \ potential 10 cm reduction in global mean sea level if warming is limited to\
    \ 1.5\xB0C, and marked differences in high-end SLR predictions between AR5 and\
    \ SEJ2018 scenarios."
  5: Expert judgments of uncertainties in ice sheet contributions to SLR have grown
    since the AR5. The paper suggests that SLR could exceed 2 m by 2100 under a high-temperature
    scenario. Consideration of the upper tail behavior of SLR estimates is crucial
    for robust decision-making. The acceleration in mass loss from the GrIS is predominantly
    a result of external forcing.
  6: The study forms a weighted combination of experts based on statistical accuracy
    (PW01) to provide robust representation from both expert panels. Six US and two
    European experts were preferred. The paper also mentions that the study code is
    available at github.com/wp/bobkopp/LocalizeSL.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis uses structured expert judgment to model correlations and tail dependences
    between ice sheet processes and their impact on sea-level rise.
  2: The analysis uses structured expert judgement (SEJ) conducted in workshops involving
    22 experts, focusing on ice sheet mass balance and dependencies among processes.
  4: The analysis uses expert judgment and stochastic resampling of distributions
    to evaluate ice sheet contributions to sea level rise.
  5: Experts were convened in two workshops to provide judgments on uncertainties
    in ice sheet contributions to SLR. These judgments were then combined with probabilistic
    SLR projection frameworks to estimate total SLR. The analysis incorporates Monte
    Carlo samples and considers thermal expansion, glacier melt, and land-water storage.
  6: The study uses an expert elicitation approach with the Classical Model Decision
    Maker approach. Experts answered seed, target, and rationale questions, and preliminary
    probability distributions were developed, presented, and revised. The period for
    answering questions was about 6-8 hours overall. The final uncertainty distributions
    were recalculated to conform to achieving optimal statistical accuracy with minimal
    credible bounds.
More Notes:
  4: There is a notable shift in median and upper percentile SLR values for SEJ over
    AR5, particularly in high-emission scenarios, suggesting higher risk compared
    to past assessments.
  5: The study highlights a shift in expert opinion since 2012 regarding the GrIS,
    with a stronger belief that recent acceleration in mass loss is due to external
    forcing rather than internal variability. The findings emphasize the skewness
    of the expert distribution, with the 95th percentile tracking the high end of
    published projections.
Quantitative material:
  1: "The page provides median and 95th percentile estimates of SLR contributions\
    \ by 2100 for different temperature scenarios: 26 cm (median) and 81 cm (95th\
    \ percentile) for a +2 \xB0C scenario; 51 cm (median) and 178 cm (95th percentile)\
    \ for a +5 \xB0C scenario."
  2: Projections show sea level rise contributions ranging from 10 cm to 51 cm by
    2100 under different temperature scenarios.
  4: The paper presents SLR predictions at the 17th, 50th, and 83rd percentiles, with
    a significant difference between AR5 and SEJ2018 scenarios, showing almost three
    times larger upper bound for RCP8.5.
  5: Provides SLR projections for 2050 and 2100 under low (L) and high (H) temperature
    scenarios, including median, 17-83%, 5-95%, and 1-99% percentile ranges. For example,
    the 2100 H median projection is 1.1 m with a 90th percentile range of 0.6-2.4
    m.
  6: The study provides probability distributions for sea-level rise. The paper mentions
    that the Classical Model allows choosing an optimal threshold that maximizes the
    statistical accuracy and informativeness of the resulting combination. The effect
    of this optimization is a moderate reduction in the 90th percentile credible range
    relative to the PW01 combination. Expert scoring is shown in SI Appendix, Table
