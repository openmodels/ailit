Drivers of Risk:
  1: Droughts, specifically climate change-type droughts (longer, warmer, and more
    frequent), and previous-year soil moisture anomaly.
  4: Decreasing trends in soil moisture anomaly are significant in plots for Norway
    spruce, European larch, and minor tree species. Millennial drought events in 2003
    and 2018 are associated with mortality peaks in 2005 and 2019 for several conifer
    species.
Highlights:
  1: "Overall and species-speci\uFB01c increasing trends in mortality rates, accompanied\
    \ by decreasing soil moisture. Previous-year soil moisture anomaly identified\
    \ as the most important driver of mortality patterns in conifers. Mortality patterns\
    \ in European forests are currently reaching a concerning upward trend which could\
    \ be further accelerated by global change-type droughts in the near future."
  4: Linearly increasing trends in annual mortality rates were significant for several
    tree species. Conifers showed characteristic mortality peaks after drought events.
Methodology:
  1: Use of the ICP Forest crown defoliation dataset to retrospectively monitor tree
    mortality for all major conifers, major broadleaves, as well as a pooled dataset
    of minor tree species in Europe. Employed a high-resolution drought index which
    can assess soil moisture anomaly based on a hydrological water-balance and runoff
    model. Generalized linear mixed model.
  4: The analysis used the R package brms (version 2.16.3) based on the probabilistic
    programming language Stan. Models were run with four MCMC chains and compared
    using approximate leave-one-out cross validation.
More Notes:
  1: The study emphasizes the need for forest monitoring to guide future forest management
    plans due to the potential for climate change-type droughts to affect the entire
    continent, not just specific regions.
  4: The study investigates the temporal dynamics and trends in annual mortality rate
    and soil moisture anomaly by species, providing a comparison of these trends using
    line graphs from 1990 to 2020.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: European forests are an important source for timber production, human welfare,
    income, protection and biodiversity.
  4: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: Analysed more than three million observations gathered during the last 25 years.
  4: Linearly increasing trends in annual mortality rates were significant for Norway
    spruce, oak, European beech, Scots pine, European larch, as well as for the remaining
    minor tree species (P < 0.05).
