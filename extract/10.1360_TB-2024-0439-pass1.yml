Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate risk and opportunities
  3: Anthropogenic climate change; Sea level rise; Extreme weather events (heatwaves,
    droughts).
  4: No relevant information
  7: Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events (heatwaves, floods,
    and hurricanes). Human-induced climate change contributes to heatwave mortality,
    labor productivity loss, drought, and flood impacts.
Highlights:
  3: Anthropogenic climate change has significant impacts on health and productivity,
    with the southern regions of China being more vulnerable; Sea level rise will
    affect an increasing proportion of the coastal population; Urban green spaces
    are beneficial for health; Air pollution from coal consumption continues to be
    a concern despite improvements in some areas.
  4: No relevant information
  7: Record-breaking heat and drought of 2022 were associated with increased adverse
    health outcomes, including a 342% increase in heatwave-related mortality and a
    24% increase in heat-related work loss.
Methodology:
  4: No relevant information
  7: The paper uses indicators across five domains (climate change impacts, adaptation,
    mitigation, economics and finance, and public and political engagement) to track
    progress on health and climate change in China.
More Notes:
  1: "The title suggests a review or commentary ('\u76D8\u70B9\u6C14\u5019\u98CE\u9669\
    \u673A\u9047, \u5C55\u671B\u5065\u5EB7\u7E41\u8363\u672A\u6765'), indicating it\
    \ likely synthesizes existing research on climate risks and adaptation, rather\
    \ than presenting novel empirical findings. The presence of numerous authors from\
    \ diverse institutions (including international ones) suggests a collaborative\
    \ effort."
  3: The paper highlights a disconnect between public awareness of climate-related
    health risks (increased social media attention) and the attention given to health
    issues in professional channels (newspapers, journals, government websites); Health
    concerns are not always prioritized in climate change mitigation and adaptation
    actions; There is an increasing area covered by climate risk early-warning systems
    for temperature-related events.
  4: This page primarily discusses policy recommendations and an overview of impacts
    and responses tracked in the 2023 China Report of the Lancet Countdown on Health
    and Climate Change. It does not provide specific macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes or costs and benefits of adaptation at a national level.
  7: The paper provides recommendations to safeguard against climate change-related
    health risks, including increasing investment in renewable energy, harnessing
    synergies between carbon reduction and air quality improvement, and establishing
    meteorology-informed early warning systems.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Health and prosperity in the future
  3: Heat-related mortality; Labor productivity loss.

Quantitative material:
  3: 49.4% of heatwave-related deaths, 30.9% of heatwave-related labor productivity
    loss, and 98.8% of the population affected by drought are attributed to human-caused
    climate change; Coastal provinces will see the population affected by sea level
    rise increase from 7.7% in 2050 to 12.9% in 2100; Urban green spaces averted approximately
    38,000 premature deaths in China over the past 20 years; Energy transition combined
    with pollution control measures avoided approximately 72,000, 37,000, and 24,000
    premature deaths in the household, power, and industrial sectors, respectively;
    Coal consumption growth reached 4.3% in 2022.
  4: No relevant information
  7: Human-caused climate change was responsible for 49.4% of heatwave-related mortality,
    30.9% of heat-related labor productivity loss, 98.8% of population affected by
    drought, and 7.6% of population affected by flood in the previous 20 years.
