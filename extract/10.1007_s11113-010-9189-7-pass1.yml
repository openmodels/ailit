Drivers of Risk:
  5: Demographic changes, geography, infrastructure, access to various forms of capital,
    and social and cultural factors influence vulnerability to climate change impacts.
    Population growth parallels increases in economic growth, energy consumption and
    greenhouse gas emissions.
  11: Population aging, urbanization, household shrinking, demographic trends
  12: Population aging, technological change (energy intensity and carbon intensity)
  14: Global greenhouse gas emissions will continue to increase at least up to the
    year 2020.
  15: Climate change leading to droughts, floods, landslides, and cyclones is the
    main driver of risk discussed.
  17: Rising temperatures leading to health issues and reduced water availability.
  22: Rapid population growth in sub-Saharan Africa, offset by lower population growth
    in Eastern Europe and China; Policy attention to population stabilization; weakened
    healthcare and family planning services; imbalance between demographic growth
    rates and social, economic and environmental goals
Highlights:
  5: Population factors have yet to be fully incorporated into adaptation strategies.
    The recent climate models may have an important limitation in the demographic
    component, which may have resulted in underestimating the impacts of population
    on climate change.
  11: Considering the effects of population compositional changes, aging is a more
    important demographic factor related to carbon emissions in the developed world
    while urbanization is more significant in developing countries; Households, instead
    of individuals in a population, should be used as the variable for analyzing demographic
    impact on emissions, as households are the units of consumption; Using number
    of households or population size as the demographic unit of analysis leads to
    substantially different conclusions about the demographic impact on energy use;
    Aging will contribute to higher emissions up to year 2030 and then to lower emissions
    thereafter, as the proportion of the labor force population declines.
  12: Population aging generally drives emissions down, while technological changes
    initially contribute to slightly higher emissions due to increased energy consumption
    from improved efficiency and reduced costs. The impact of population compositional
    changes (mainly aging) on carbon emissions can be larger than that of technological
    changes under certain circumstances (before 2085 in China).
  14: The impact of climate change on the human population is not evenly distributed
    across regions, with the poorest countries and population groups bearing the brunt
    of changes related to climate change.
  15: Poorest countries and population groups will bear the brunt of climate change;
    adaptation strategies will be critical for these countries. Low-income areas have
    significantly higher population densities and are more susceptible to climate
    variation and extreme weather events.
  17: Half of the world's population expected to live in water-stressed countries
    by 2050 without even factoring in climate change.
Methodology:
  11: Projections of future carbon emissions considering the effects of population
    aging and urbanization
  12: 'Model-based analysis considering different scenarios: no technological change
    or aging (only population size), aging and technological change, only aging, and
    only technological change. Sensitivity analyses are used to understand the relative
    importance of aging and technological changes.'
More Notes:
  12: The analysis focuses on China and references similar analysis for the U.S. in
    Figure 4 (not shown). The type of technological changes considered relates to
    energy intensity and carbon intensity.
  14: Spatial analysis of hazard distribution indicates that low income populations
    have been affected by more types of climate-related hazards.
  15: The analysis relies on a grid-based approach to assess hazard frequency and
    population density across income groups. Income levels are derived based on per
    capita GDP of each grid and grouped into income quartile. The study uses data
    from 2005 as a reference point for population density.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  11: Future carbon emissions
  12: Carbon emissions (GtC/year)
  14: Seemingly small values of warming (1 to 2.5 degree Celsius) are expected to
    produce net benefits in the short-term in some regions and for some activities
    (e.g. agricultural and transportation) and net costs for others.
  15: The analysis touches on the impact of climate-related hazards (cyclones, droughts,
    floods, landslides) on populations, but does not directly quantify macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes.
  22: Rapid economic growth; resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change
Quantitative material:
  5: 'From 1800 to 2000: population increased 6x, GDP increased 70x, primary energy
    use increased 35x, and CO2 emissions increased 20x.'
  11: China's annual carbon emissions will increase from 1.2 GtC in 2000 to 3.8 GtC
    by the end of the century; estimate of carbon emissions is 45% higher in 2100
    than projections that do not incorporate aging and urbanization
  12: Figure 3 shows carbon emissions from 2000 to 2100 under different scenarios.
    In a scenario with only population size considered, total emissions will increase
    from 1.5 GtC in 2000 to 3.6 GtC in 2100. With both technological change and aging,
    carbon emissions increase to about 2 GtC by the end of the century.
  14: Seemingly small values of warming (1 to 2.5 degree Celsius) are expected to
    produce net benefits in the short-term in some regions.
  15: In 2005, the average population density in developing countries was 66 people/km2,
    which is more than double the figure in developed regions (27 people/km2). The
    unit of analysis is a grid cell with the world divided into a 2.8 x 2.8 grid.
