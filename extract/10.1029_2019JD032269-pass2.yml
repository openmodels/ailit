Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased drought severity in recent decades was linked to changes in frequency
    of dry and wet circulation types.
  2: Projected increase of the global temperature and more intense and longer lasting
    heat waves are drivers of drought risk.
  4: Drought, specifically weekly changes in drought indices. Different responses
    to changes in input variables between vegetation and cold periods.
  13: Droughts driven by increased frequency of dry circulation patterns in the vegetation
    period and resulting in soil moisture depletion.
Highlights:
  1: "The 2015\u20132018 drought was record\u2010breaking in the context of observational\
    \ record in central Europe. Increased drought severity in the recent decades was\
    \ linked to higher frequency of dry circulation types at the expense of wet types."
  4: Short-term drought indices (PZIN and SPEI-4) exhibit larger values of weekly
    tendencies compared to long-term ones. Significant differences exist between vegetation
    and cold period distributions of drought index tendencies (except SPEI-4).
  13: The study found a strong link between increased frequency of dry circulation
    types and the occurrence of droughts during the vegetation period, highlighting
    a feedback mechanism between soil moisture and climate.
Methodology:
  1: "Temporal variability of drought conditions since the late 19th century was analyzed\
    \ at seven long-term stations distributed across the Czech Republic using the\
    \ Palmer Drought Severity Index and the Standardized Precipitation Evaporation\
    \ Index. Changes in circulation were analyzed through circulation types calculated\
    \ from flow strength, direction and vorticity in mean sea level pressure data\
    \ from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis for 1948\u20132018."
  2: The severity of droughts was assessed for seven long-term stations located in
    the Czech Republic using four drought indices (Table 1).
  4: Statistical analysis of weekly changes in drought indices (PDSI, SPEI-52, PZIN,
    SPEI-4) calculated separately for vegetation (April-September) and cold (October-March)
    periods. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test used to assess differences between vegetation
    and cold period distributions. Calculation of circulation types derived from circulation
    indices (flow strength, direction, and vorticity) using sea level pressure data.
  13: Analysis of historical drought events using the Palmer Drought Severity Index
    (PDSI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI-52) considering
    the role of atmospheric circulation patterns.
More Notes:
  4: The study focuses on characterizing and analyzing drought conditions and their
    changes over time using various drought indices and atmospheric circulation patterns,
    but it does not directly quantify macroeconomic or macro-fiscal impacts or adaptation
    costs/benefits. The link to economic outcomes needs further steps.

  3: This page focuses on drought indices (PDSI, PZIN, SPEI) and their calculation,
    not on macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes or the costs and benefits of adaptation
    at a national level. It primarily describes the methodology for calculating these
    indices using temperature and precipitation data.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Substantial economic losses especially in agriculture due to drought.
  2: Major economic losses and substantial crop failures were reported in Czech Republic
    during the summer of 2018 due to drought.
