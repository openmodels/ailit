Drivers of Risk:
  5: No relevant information
  6: Natural disasters, climate change
  10: Natural hazards (frequency and intensity), population exposure, lack of resilience,
    climate change (increasing intensity/frequency of natural hazards and population
    affected), slow buildup of human pressure on resources, choices made in economic
    development strategies.
  11: No relevant information
  12: Natural disasters (drought, earthquake, flood, insect infestation, earth slides,
    volcanic eruptions, waves or surges, and wind storms) between 1975 and 2005.
  13: Increased frequency of extreme weather events
  14: Natural disasters; loss of capital stock.
  15: Natural disasters lead to physical and human capital stock losses, influencing
    economic outcomes such as GDP and potential future conflicts.
  16: Disasters (e.g., earthquakes, droughts)
  17: Different types of natural disasters have different consequences. Geological
    events are more likely to generate Schumpeterian innovation and stimulate postdisaster
    growth, while hydrometeorological disasters are generally more frequent, creating
    an atmosphere of uncertainty that hurts the investment climate and requires adaptation
    costs.
  22: High vulnerability leads to frequent large-scale natural disasters, preventing
    countries from rebuilding capital and productive capacities.
  23: Successive disasters and severe climate change events (including 'cataclysmic
    climate change').
  25: Floods (2000, 2001); Drought vulnerability.
  32: Natural disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes, floods); High covariance risk in
    insurance schemes and microcredit portfolios; Long-term decline in banana prices
  33: Natural disasters, particularly in highly indebted poor countries where debt
    service is a heavy burden.
  34: Floods, droughts, and wind storms are the most frequent types of disasters in
    Sub-Saharan Africa.
  35: Natural disasters; Climate change impacts

Highlights:
  5: No relevant information
  6: African governments need to develop a more robust adaptation and response capability
    to disasters as part of their overall development planning.
  10: Hazards are created by nature, but disasters are largely man-made. Development
    and disasters are closely interlinked. Vulnerability is a function of exposure
    to shocks and resilience.
  11: The paper highlights the interactions between development and vulnerability
    to natural hazards.
  12: Highly vulnerable poor countries may suffer frequent disasters that preclude
    development gains, preventing improved resilience, creating a potential vicious
    circle.
  13: Climate change significantly impacts long-term economic growth and fiscal stability.
  14: Natural disasters can have severe short-term consequences; the impact on output
    is proportional to the reduction in the capital stock; with modified assumptions,
    there is a much smaller impact on output, implying natural disasters are unlikely
    to have long-term impact on growth; resources used after a disaster are not necessarily
    additional and can have a high opportunity cost.
  15: 'Scenarios of post-disaster impacts on growth rate vary: some return to equilibrium,
    while others experience permanent reductions in capital stock affecting long-term
    growth.'
  16: Disasters can have varying long-term impacts on GDP per capita, ranging from
    a permanent reduction to stimulating technological change and enhanced growth.
    Different types of disasters are associated with different GDP impact scenarios.
  17: Geological events, which are less frequent but often more cataclysmic, are more
    likely to generate Schumpeterian innovation and stimulate postdisaster growth,
    while hydrometeorological disasters are generally more frequent, creating an atmosphere
    of uncertainty that hurts the investment climate and requires adaptation costs.
  22: Vulnerable countries may experience high instability and be disconnected from
    expected growth paths due to natural disasters.
  23: Severe climate change without prevention or coping action could lead to a sharp
    drop in income and consumption, causing increased poverty, malnutrition, and mass
    famines, as well as serious disruption to development.
  25: High levels of donor response and government commitment to macroeconomic stability
    dampened negative impacts of disasters, allowing a rapid return to high levels
    of growth.
  32: Risk transfer mechanisms like insurance and catastrophe bonds can provide immediate
    funds after disasters, reducing pressure on fiscal balances; Microcredit institutions
    can help vulnerable populations recover from disasters, but are themselves highly
    exposed and require government backstop; Pooling and diversification of risk,
    donor contributions, and parametric triggers can lower insurance costs.
  33: Debt relief as a rapid finance tool post-disaster, and the importance of proactive
    disaster preparedness and forecasting.
  34: Droughts tend to affect a much larger number of people than other types of disasters.
  35: The cost of inaction related to natural disasters and climate change will be
    far greater than the cost of adaptation.

  6: Outlines a framework for thinking about the links among natural disasters, climate
    change, and economic development.
  10: 'Conceptual framework of vulnerability (V) as a function of natural hazards
    (NH), population exposure (P), and resilience (R): V = f(NH, P, R).'
  11: The paper aims to highlight the interactions between development and vulnerability
    to natural hazards to foster research that will improve future decision making.
    The second section reveals the limited knowledge of the long-term economic impact
    of natural disasters and proposes scenarios that may represent the long-term impact
    of a disaster on GDP.
  12: The analysis includes case studies, theory, and evidence.
  13: Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, applied to a 30-year time horizon.
  14: Macroeconomic model based on economic linkage and substitution effects, setting
    an upper limit on output impact assuming all losses are to the capital stock;
    modification of assumptions to account for split loss between capital and output
    and heterogeneous capital.
  15: Use of recursive Keynesian growth models to analyze disaster impacts on indebtedness
    and capital accumulation models to assess impact on future growth.
  17: Distinction between geological and hydro-meteorological disasters is needed.

  6: Argues for more market-based financing mechanisms and an emphasis on forecasting
    research; calls for more work on the links between climate change and disasters
    and a new way of looking at disaster resilience as a continuum to development
    strategies.
  10: There are links among conflict, security, and disasters, with the pressure on
    resources often leading to increased probability of conflict.
  12: The paper calls for further research and country case studies to better understand
    how development choices have led to differing levels of vulnerability.
  13: The model incorporates uncertainty around climate projections.
  16: The long-term consequences of natural hazards on economic growth is contested.
  21: This page primarily discusses vulnerability to drought and famine, with a focus
    on the role of human factors and governance rather than quantifying macroeconomic
    or fiscal impacts.
  22: Countries need to build resilience to natural hazards into their development
    policies to emerge from high vulnerability.
  32: Aid flows can be used to invest in market-based risk-spreading options; African
    countries should conceive their own solutions for disaster risk management based
    on initiatives like the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF).
  35: The table and analysis are limited to Sub-Saharan countries that have a Poverty
    Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
