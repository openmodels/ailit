Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on precipitation patterns, leading to variability in predicted
    mean flows in the Ganges and its tributaries.
  4: Climate variability leading to extreme floods and droughts, and uncertainty in
    monsoon timing.
  14: Projected changes in river flow (average flow at Farakka in the Ganges basin)
    due to climate change; Changes in runoff across space.
  15: Changes in snowmelt, runoff, and evapotranspiration (ET) affecting river flows
    in the Ganges basin.
  16: Changes in mean flows of the Ganges River (both increases and decreases) due
    to climate change, variability around projected mean changes in river flows, changes
    in tributaries water flows, increased evapotranspiration, change in seasonality
    of flows.
  17: Changes in water flow (flooding and drought) in the Ganges river system due
    to climate change
  18: Changes in river flow conditions due to climate change, modeled using various
    Global Climate Models (GCMs) under the A2 emissions scenario for 2050; Shifting
    seasonality of water availability.
  19: Changes in river hydrology, sediment loads, and sea level rise affecting inundation,
    storm surge, seawater intrusion, land erosion, and accretion in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna
    delta.
  20: Climate change impacts on natural flow variability and infrastructure development
    scenarios.
  21: Climate change impacts, including temperature increases and uncertain precipitation
    changes, affecting glacier and snow melt, runoff, and agricultural water availability.
  22: Increased temperature, variability in rainfall and runoff, local rainfall, and
    embankment protection failures leading to floods.
  24: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: Climate change projections lead to considerable differences in predictions of
    mean flows, but these flows remain within the range of natural variability, except
    perhaps at tributary levels. Hydropower potential in Nepal remains high across
    climate models.
  4: Climate variability in the Ganges basin leads to extreme floods and droughts,
    significantly impacting lives, livelihoods, infrastructure, and economic activities.
  14: Projects changes in water availability in the Ganges basin, with projections
    varying significantly depending on the climate model used.
  15: The Kosi tributary is likely to carry significantly more flow in the future,
    while the Gandak may carry somewhat less.
  16: Projected changes in Ganges flows are within the natural variability of the
    system but variability around projected mean changes could create major new challenges
    for populations in the basin. Decreased flow is predicted for several major tributaries
    in the western Ganges and median outcomes for hydropower and irrigation water
    use are somewhat reduced from the historical case across infrastructure scenarios.
  17: Presents simulated water flow data under different climate change scenarios
    and dam operation assumptions.
  18: Climate models suggest the possibility of either lower or higher water use in
    irrigation under climate change. Low season flows in Bangladesh appear to increase
    somewhat in the median scenario; There's high model uncertainty surrounding projections
    of hydropower production in Nepal.
  19: Optimal water allocation in Bangladesh is sensitive to the relative values of
    water in irrigation versus low flow augmentation. Land accretion has exceeded
    erosion in recent years in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta, protecting the
    western coast of Bangladesh. There is little tradeoff between hydropower and downstream
    water use in the Ganges basin.
  20: Full infrastructure development could allow 25-40 BCM/yr of additional downstream
    use; infrastructure generates significant economic benefits, particularly in energy
    production.
  21: The study assesses the economic impacts of different water management strategies,
    including dam construction, on hydropower production, irrigation, and downstream
    flows to Bangladesh under climate change scenarios.
  22: Investment in storage and irrigation infrastructure is a common strategy for
    managing hydrological variability.

Methodology:
  1: The study uses downscaling of climate projections, water balance calculations,
    hydrological simulation, and economic optimization to assess the impact of climate
    change on the Ganges system.
  14: Uses downscaled WCRP CMIP3 data to project changes in flow and runoff. Results
    are applicable for the Ganges basin and specifically for the A2 emissions scenario,
    around 2050.
  15: Uses climate GCMs to project future flows in the Ganges river basin for the
    year 2050, comparing these projections to historical flow data.
  16: Hydrological modeling using GCM projections of climate change impacts on river
    flows in the Ganges basin. Optimization model used to assess hydropower and irrigation
    water use under different climate and infrastructure scenarios. Results vary considerably
    across space.
  17: Uses hydrological models to simulate water flow under different climate change
    scenarios and dam operation assumptions; Applicable to the Ganges river system
    and specifically Bangladesh.
  18: GCMs are used to project changes in river flows, which are then used to model
    impacts on hydropower production; The study considers the A2 emissions scenario
    for 2050; The paper references an optimization model allowing for use of groundwater
    during periods of surface water shortage to meet crop water requirements; the
    model restricts permanent depletion of groundwater.
  19: Uses the SWAT model to simulate hydrological changes. Analyzes the relative
    value of water in irrigation versus low flow augmentation to determine optimal
    water allocations. Examines land accretion and erosion using satellite imagery.
  20: Analysis models the effects of infrastructure on water allocation and high flow
    events under various climate scenarios.
  21: Uses GCM projections for the A2 emissions scenario for 2050 to model optimal
    water allocations and their associated economic values.

More Notes:
  1: "The assessment is a basin-wide analysis undertaken as part of the World Bank\u2019\
    s Ganges Strategic Basin Assessment."
  14: The figures illustrate the range of uncertainty in climate change projections,
    with different GCMs predicting different spatial patterns of water yield changes.
  15: The effect of increased flows on flood risks in the Kosi catchment is unclear
    due to the presence of embankments, which have been breached but not overtopped
    even in years with flows 23% above the 1969-2001 mean.
  16: The analysis maintains the minimum flows guaranteed to Bangladesh by the Farakka
    Agreement. The temporal pattern of surface water irrigation withdrawals is assumed
    to not be modified under climate change.
  17: Appears to be focused on water resources and irrigation, not direct macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes.
  18: GCMs may not accurately simulate monsoon precipitation in South Asia; Irrigation
    water use patterns are likely to be responsive to changing seasonality if irrigators
    adapt.
  20: The economic viability of projects depends on future flow conditions and downstream
    water use values.
  21: The analysis highlights the interconnectedness of climate change impacts and
    the uncertainty associated with model predictions in the basin. It aims to provide
    a basis for comparing different dam strategies using economic values.
  22: The analysis emphasizes storage and irrigation infrastructure for hydropower
    and dry season water supply benefits.

    \ 100,000 km2, with a median of just over 30,000 km2. People in the Indian state\
    \ of Bihar have been affected by floods every year since 1979, with over 20 million\
    \ people affected in 1987, 2004, and 2007. Flows at Farakka (Ganges river) were\
    \ 38% lower than average in a low year (1991) and 49% higher than average in a\

    \ A2 emissions scenario by 2050. Offers maps showing change in annual water yield\
    \ by the 2050s under different GCMs."
  15: Average simulated flows in the Kosi sub-basin in India are higher for all but
    one climate model (decrease of 14%), with an average increase of 26% and a maximum

    2050).
  16: "Projected changes in mean flows range from a decrease of 21% to an increase\

    \ deviation of 3,400 m3/s). Dry season flows decrease only 9% to 2,480 m3/s in\
    \ the driest GCM scenario, and increase by 66% to about 4,510 m3/s in wet scenarios.\
    \ Surface water use in irrigation decreases from 3 to 10 BCM across infrastructure\
    \ cases. High value conditions for low flows increase water use in irrigated systems\
    \ by 3\u201315 BCM."
