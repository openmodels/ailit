Drivers of Risk:
  3: Climate variability (multi-annual to decadal oscillation in the climate system);
    Shocks; Competition for resources.
  4: Climate variability (specifically in-phase and out-of-phase sine wave patterns
    affecting resource availability at nodes) and network topology (small-world, undirected
    networks with varying numbers of nodes).
  5: Network topology (network size, closeness centrality of nodes), resource variability,
    distance between nodes, and demand increases.
  8: Resource variability (amplitude and frequency), and phase relationships (in phase
    vs. out of phase) between resources.
  9: Resource variability, including low and high amplitude, and low and high frequency
    of resource availability. Spatial autocorrelation of variability, and network
    size are also drivers of risk.
  12: Climate-induced resource variability and shocks to the food trade network.
  15: Climate variability, network topology, and shocks impact population growth and
    food trade network resilience.
Highlights:
  3: The dynamics identified in the study are intended to provide insights that are
    generalisable to food trade networks.
  5: The paper examines the effects of network topology and resource variability on
    the growth and variation of population in nodes and networks.
  8: Resource variability affects NEP distributions within food trade networks.  The
    specific effects depend on the amplitude, frequency, and phase relationships of
    the resource variability, as well as the network size.
  9: GEP is higher under out-of-phase variability and lower amplitude/frequency of
    variability. Larger networks result in more equality in NEP and higher GEP. Variation
    of GEP is lower over time in out-of-phase variability scenarios, and lower amplitude/higher
    frequency of variability.
  12: More central nodes in the food trade network have higher NEP and are less susceptible
    to climate-induced resource variability and shocks. Shocks to more central nodes
    cause more damage to overall GEP (likely refers to Global Equilibrium Population).
  15: Increased climate variability due to anthropogenic climate change is expected
    to result in larger amplitude and higher frequency variations in food production.
Methodology:
  3: A simple model that simulates a food distribution system with 10 and 100 nodes
    with a small-world network configuration. Population growth is simulated as a
    function of local resources at the node and competition for resources in the rest
    of the network. Resources varied in the network with varying amplitude and periodicity
    to reflect climate variability. Simulations were carried out on networks generated
    using the Watts-Strogatz model.
  4: The analysis uses simulations on small-world, undirected networks with 10 and
    100 nodes, modeling resource availability with sine waves and resource redistribution
    via a trade equation (Eq 2) based on surplus.
  5: A food trade network is modeled. The model focuses on resource availability rather
    than demand-driven dynamics to determine carrying capacity. Trade flow is determined
    by resource availability and distance between nodes (using a gravity model). Population
    growth at each node is based on access to resources (local resources and imports).
  8: Simulation of food trade networks with varying network topologies (10 and 100
    nodes) and resource variability scenarios. Analysis focuses on the cumulative
    distribution of NEP under different conditions.
  9: The paper uses a food trade network model to simulate the effects of different
    resource variability scenarios on population distribution and stability. It assesses
    the impact of network topology (number of nodes) and climate variability (amplitude,
    frequency, phase) on the evolution and resilience of the network.
  12: The analysis is based on modeling a food trade network and simulating shocks.
    The results are applicable to understanding how network topology and node centrality
    influence resilience to resource variability and shocks.
  15: Analysis of resource redistribution in a small-world network model simulating
    climate variability, network topology, and shocks.
More Notes:
  3: The model is generalisable and may represent countries, cities or other spatially
    constrained trading entities.
  4: The paper models resource specialization, with 50% of food available for export
    and 50% consumed locally. The doi is provided, allowing one to find the entire
    paper. The images show the networks and variability scenarios being used.
  5: The closeness centrality of nodes is normalized to allow comparison between networks
    of different sizes. The variability of NEP and GEP over time after equilibrium
    is reflected in the coefficient of variation.
  8: The paper uses NEP in a food trade network context as a proxy for resilience,
    which is not a direct macroeconomic variable but can impact national food security
    and potentially influence macroeconomic outcomes.
  9: The paper focuses on the impact of climate variability on food trade networks,
    highlighting the importance of network size and spatial autocorrelation of variability
    in determining population distribution and stability. It's not directly translatable
    to macroeconomic outcomes but the trade network model is a basis for understanding
    climate impacts on economic outcomes.
  12: The paper suggests that trade in a small-world network can effectively deal
    with resource variability and increase carrying capacity. However, the page presents
    a stylized model and does not directly quantify macroeconomic outcomes like GDP
    effects or fiscal impacts. The focus is on network properties and their influence
    on population levels within the network after a shock.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Access to resources in a trading network; Population of a node (NEP) in response
    to climate variability and shocks.
  4: The paper focuses on the resilience of a food trade network, implying outcomes
    related to food availability and distribution across nodes.
  5: Population size and its variation in nodes and networks; Node Equilibrium Population
    (NEP) - population of a node once the simulation reaches equilibrium; Global Equilibrium
    Population (GEP) - average NEP of nodes in a network.
  8: Network Equilibrium Population (NEP) as a proxy for resilience in food trade
    networks
  9: Global Equilibrium Population (GEP), a measure of the average population of nodes
    in a food trade network, and Network Equality in Population (NEP), the equality
    of the populations of nodes in a food trade network.
  12: The paper investigates the effects of shocks and climate variability on a food
    trade network, focusing on Node Equilibrium Population (NEP) as a measure of resilience.
    While not directly a macroeconomic indicator, NEP can be interpreted as a proxy
    for economic activity or food security at a node (potentially a region or country)
    level.
Quantitative material:
  3: "The model runs for 1000 iterations; Starting population at every node is 1250\
    \ people; Mean resource production (\u03BC) is set at 1 million kg of food resources,\
    \ which is sufficient to support 5000 people with a consumption of 200 kg per\
    \ year per person."
  5: "Equation (2) models trade flow between nodes based on resource availability\
    \ and distance. Equation (3) calculates population growth based on carrying capacity.\
    \ A constant yearly growth rate (\u03B1) of 1.2% (estimated average global population\
    \ growth rate in 2015) is used."
  8: Cumulative distribution of NEP for different resource variability scenarios,
    including 10 and 100 node networks.  Quantitative data is presented graphically
    with specific values for NEP on the x-axis and cumulative distribution on the
    y-axis.
  9: Table 2 shows GEP for 10 and 100 node networks under different resource variability
    scenarios (LAHF, LALF, HAHF, HALF), both in and out of phase. Table 3 shows the
    coefficient of variation of GEP over time for the same scenarios.
  12: The paper presents quantitative relationships between distance to shock node
    and decrease in NEP (exponential decay), and between closeness centrality and
    decrease in NEP (negative linear correlation), as indicated by the equations and
    R-squared values in the figure descriptions.
