  1: Weather and climate, drought, and hydrometeorological variables.
  2: Extreme weather events fueled by climate change, such as droughts, cold snaps,
    storms, and hurricanes, are impacting food security.
  3: Droughts, floods, heat waves, cold spells, and storm events (hail, snow, ice,
    wind, etc.).
  5: Evaporative demand as a factor affecting food security via water stress and atmospheric
    conditions.
  6: Not applicable
  7: Precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, and climate variability modes like
    ENSO and the Indian Ocean Dipole are identified as key drivers impacting food
    security.
  8: Weather and climate, specifically environmental extremes, are identified as important
    drivers of food insecurity. Climate variables driving food security are important
    for decision support tools.

    anthropogenic climate change, systemic risks, cascading crises.
  12: Droughts, heat waves, cascading climate-related events, poverty, rapid urbanization,
    weak governance, and the decline of ecosystems are impacting food security. Compound
    events like droughts, wildfires, and heatwaves occurring together in a region
    are drivers of risk.
  13: The drivers of risk include droughts, conflict, economic consequences of the
    COVID-19 pandemic, and weather/climate shocks. It also mentions the impacts of
    weather and climate on rainfed agriculture.
  14: Climate change leading to unprecedented impacts on the global food system, low
    predictability of precipitation, data scarcity in food insecure regions, socioeconomic
    and geopolitical challenges.

    as exposed elements during droughts.
  13: The page discusses the impacts of weather and climate on food security, particularly
    in vulnerable communities.
  14: Global food security.
Highlights:
  1: Food security has not been a primary focus of the AMS community despite its importance
    and clear roles for atmospheric and climate sciences. The AMS community is well-positioned
    to scale up its engagement across the global food system to address scientific
    needs and technology gaps to improve global food security.
  2: The interactions between climate and the food system significantly affect food
    security by altering availability, access, utilization, and stability of food.
  3: "Climate change is a 'threat multiplier' for food-insecure communities, threatening\
    \ crop yields, food supply, raising prices, and reducing growers\u2019 incomes."
  5: Evaporative demand forecasts often have longer lead times and equal or better
    skill than precipitation, aiding in more accurate monitoring and prediction of
    food-security water balances.
  6: Agricultural management is affected at multiple temporal and spatial scales.
  7: Actionable information can be derived from monitoring climate state and understanding
    climatological characteristics even with low forecast skill at longer lead times.
    Predictability of slow climate variability modes provides "forecasts of opportunity".
    Expert interpretation of monitored and forecast conditions is crucial for capitalizing
    on windows of opportunity for more skillful forecasts. Prediction skill can leverage
    specific climate phenomena not captured in climate change projections.
  8: FEWS NET is an example of successful implementation of food security early warning
    with robust stakeholder engagement. Engaging with decision-makers and stakeholders
    leads to substantial improvements in our understanding of atmospheric and climatic
    drivers.
  9: Effective communication and knowledge transfer are supported by prototypes and
    testbeds, offering strategic perspectives on systems, people, and joint visioning,
    allowing for effective testing.
  10: Knowledge transfer between researchers and humanitarian decision-makers is essential
    before, during, and after extreme events. Establishing a humanitarian prototype/testbed
    for knowledge exchange within the food-security space can improve decision-support
    products, data accessibility, and capacity building, particularly in lower-income
    countries.
  11: Models are crucial for food security applications but need improved process
    understanding and connection to food-security applications. Advancements in attribution
    can be extended to agricultural impacts. AMS plays a crucial role in supporting
    modeling and attribution.
  12: Systemic risks associated with droughts can trigger cascading events and feedback
    loops, exacerbating the initial hazard. Societal vulnerability is unequal, with
    a disproportionate impact on the poor and marginalized. Cascading and systemic
    risks must be integrated into local, national, and international dialogues on
    sustainable development, security, and political stability.
  13: Effective early warning and early action are crucial to saving lives and livelihoods,
    reducing losses and damages, and enhancing food security. Forecast-based financing
    has been successfully used to save lives and livelihoods, reduce losses and damages,
    and support the resilience of local communities.
  14: Climate change jeopardizes food security, disproportionately affecting vulnerable
    communities; Actionable early warnings depend on reliable forecasts.
Methodology:
  1: The paper is based on perspectives shared by experts at the AMS 2022 Annual Meeting
    and experts in relevant fields. It examines the interactions between weather,
    climate, and the food system; the time and spatial scales of food security decision
    support; and the roles of information providers and users.
  3: Discussion from a Presidential Forum panel and others with experience at the
    interface of food security and climate.
  5: The analysis includes hydrometeorological and climatological data across various
    time and space scales, from nowcasts to multidecadal predictions, to inform stakeholders.
  6: Diagrams show interacting spatiotemporal scales of meteorological phenomena and
    agricultural decisions.
  7: 'The paper discusses using observational data (meteorological stations, satellites),
    reanalyses, model-derived outputs, and data assimilation systems for food security
    monitoring and outlooks at different time horizons. It categorizes forecasts into
    three time horizons: 6-9 months before, within 6 months of, and within 3 months
    of a growing season, each leveraging different data and forecasting methods (e.g.,
    climatological characteristics, ENSO forecasts, expert interpretation).'
  8: Integration of climate data with socioeconomic context (market prices, consumption
    patterns, etc.) and stakeholder engagement to co-develop food security decision-support
    tools. Emphasis on the importance of translating user expertise to the research
    community [operations to research (O2R)].
  9: The paper discusses the importance of co-production, engaging users in conversations
    to understand their priorities, rather than relying solely on standardized surveys
    or raw data science.
  10: A cyclical or iterative prototype framework jointly advancing O2R (Operations
    to Research) and R2O (Research to Operations), inspired by Agile project management.
    Testbeds are used to foster collaboration and accelerate translation of R&D results
    into operations and decision-making. The framework supports O2R and R2O on a consistent
    basis.
  11: Modeling (weather, climate, and agricultural models), attribution studies using
    crop models, land surface schemes, hydrological parameterizations, data-driven
    models, and historical bias-adjusted climate datasets. Development of historical
    counterfactual climate datasets.
  13: The page describes forecast-based financing (FbF), which uses weather and climate
    forecasts and detailed risk analyses to release financial resources ahead of disasters
    to enable early action. It mentions that tailored climate forecasts and vulnerability
    analyses are used to trigger anticipatory actions for droughts in Africa.
  14: Systems-thinking approach integrating physical, economic, and behavioral sciences;
    improved communication and knowledge exchanges between meteorologists, climatologists,
    agronomists, sustainable development practitioners, policymakers, and other users.
More Notes:

    of climate change, contributing nearly one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions.
  3: Emphasizes the importance of engaging with users and decision-makers to enhance
    the exchange of knowledge and expertise. Highlights the importance of interdisciplinary
    approaches to address global food security.
  6: The page emphasizes the importance of physically and socially robust data, including
    timeliness, relevance, accessibility, accuracy, usability, and usefulness.
  7: The paper emphasizes the importance of converting data into actionable knowledge
    to inform decisions and notes that a robust forecasting infrastructure is often
    lacking in food-insecure countries.
  8: Climate forecasts are probabilistic and expressed with uncertainty. Adequate
    messaging is needed for stakeholders to understand and have confidence in using
    forecasts for decisions. The importance of stakeholder engagement in converting
    data into knowledge and driving impact-based forecasts that address local needs
    and improve early action is emphasized.
  9: The paper emphasizes the need for sustainable, equitable, and consistent knowledge
    exchange between researchers and practitioners, highlighting the challenges of
    current research and funding practices that often adopt a unidirectional approach.
  10: Emphasis is placed on two-way knowledge transfer to ensure sustainability for
    humanitarian efforts.
  11: The page emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and the inclusion
    of social and cultural aspects in models. It also discusses systemic risks and
    cascading crises.
  13: The AMS community can strengthen humanitarian response and sustainable development
    through fostering and showing the cobenefits of improved early warning of extreme
    events that impact food security. A robust understanding of climate risk and uncertainty,
    integrated with local and traditional knowledge, is key to successful food security
    interventions. Food security is important for achieving the SDGs, the Paris Agreement,
    the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, and the Convention on Biological
    Diversity.
