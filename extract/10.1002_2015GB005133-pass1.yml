Drivers of Risk:
  2: Drought events (2005, 2010) in the Amazon Basin.
  8: The 2010 drought and the 2005 drought.
  9: "Drought intensity, measured as change in climatological water deficit (\u0394\
    W)"
  11: "Drought (\u03B4 W anomaly), particularly in the southern half of Amazonia,\
    \ leading to reduced productivity and increased tree mortality."
  12: Drought, precipitation anomalies
  15: Drought impacts on Amazon forests and long-term vegetation changes.
  17: Increased frequency, intensity, and impact of drought events in the Amazon due
    to elevated temperatures and potential changes in climate regime.
Highlights:
  2: The 2010 drought had a systematic basin-wide impact on tree growth rates. The
    2010 drought resulted in a reduction in biomass carbon uptake of 1.1 Pg C.
  8: Net biomass change was significantly lower during the 2010 census interval compared
    to the long-term mean.
  9: "The magnitudes of anomalies (\u0394B) in net biomass change and productivity\
    \ for the 2010 event were significantly related to the severity of the drought\
    \ (measured as the change in W)."
  11: The Amazon basin, usually a carbon sink, became carbon neutral during the 2010
    drought, with a significant reduction in carbon uptake primarily due to decreased
    productivity and increased tree mortality.
  12: Detected a widespread reduction in forest productivity (growth) in the Amazon
    due to the 2010 drought; Mortality was also elevated in 2010, but not related
    to estimated precipitation anomalies; No evidence for enhanced impact from repeated
    droughts.
  15: Amazon forests lost biomass due to drought but returned to carbon sink status;
    no additive effect of past droughts on 2010 event.
  17: Drought negatively impacts neotropical forest carbon storage, and Amazon forest
    response to droughts is somewhat predictable.
Methodology:
  2: Analysis based on ground data of live biomass in trees, lianas, and roots in
    intact forests in Amazonia.
  8: Analysis of plot-level biomass change, productivity, and mortality based on census
    data. T-tests were used to compare biomass change during drought periods with
    baseline periods.
  9: Weighted regression, nonweighted regression, and rank-based regression used to
    analyze the relationship between drought intensity and biomass change (net change,
    productivity, and mortality). Analysis focuses on the 2010 drought event and compares
    data to a 1998-pre-2010 baseline.
  11: "Analysis of intact forest plots during the 2010 drought event, scaling field\
    \ measurements by region. Comparison of biomass change (\u0394 B) for plots undergoing\
    \ or not undergoing drought in 2010 and in pre-2010 (2000 to <2010) periods."
  12: Analysis of tree growth and mortality using forest censuses covering the 2010
    drought period
  15: Ground-based measurements and satellite data were used to assess biomass loss
    and recovery; results applicable to the 2010 drought.
  17: Analysis of forest response to droughts in the Amazon, including mortality and
    productivity from forest inventory and regional-scale inversions.
More Notes:
  2: The study suggests increased climatic variability and uncertainty in future climate
    predictions for the Amazon Basin. The magnitude of tree mortality was unrelated
    to local precipitation anomalies and pre-2010 drought history.
  8: The negative net biomass change anomaly in 2010 confirms that biomass change
    was much lower compared to the long-term mean of positive biomass change.
  9: The paper focuses on the Amazon rainforest response to droughts, specifically
    the impact of the 2010 drought on biomass change, productivity, and mortality.
  11: "The time since the last drought did not explain differences in \u0394 B, B\
    \ net change, or B gains/losses."
  12: The lack of net biomass gain in 2010 was widespread and not confined to one
    region.
  15: Challenges in evaluating drought response include long-term forest changes and
    variability in climate impact.
  17: Future droughts may exacerbate due to elevated temperatures, highlighting the
    need for improved understanding of forest response to drought events.
