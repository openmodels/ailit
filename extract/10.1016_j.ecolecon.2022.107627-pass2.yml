Highlights:
  2: Dry spells during the hottest part of the year depress crop production, with
    significant yield losses concentrated in non-irrigated areas, suggesting adaptation
    may mitigate some impacts.
  4: Understanding potential interactions between dry spells and temperature stress
    is critical because combined dry and hot weather is growing more common.
  7: The study quantifies dry spell days per grid cell, focusing on periods of high
    heat and incorporating cropland area as a weighting factor to approximate crop
    exposure.
  8: Investigates joint exposure to dry spells and heat waves as a driver of risk.
  9: The study explores exposure to drought and irrigation by partitioning cells based
    on whether the fraction of cropland equipped for irrigation is above or below
    the median.
  10: Exposure to dry spells, heat waves, and drought conditions is changing through
    time.
  11: "Significant negative correlation between growth in the FAO CPI and dry spell\
    \ days in more arid countries (aridity index below the median) and in countries\
    \ experiencing drier years (SPEI \u2264 0)."
  12: The direct effects of dry spells on the FAO CPI are found to be transitory.
  13: "The paper examines the differential effect of simultaneous and co-located exposure\
    \ to low precipitation and high heat (captured by \U0001D6FC4). It also examines\
    \ how drought and aridity modify the effects of dry spells and heat waves."
  16: Significant negative effects of dry spell days are observed when the minimum
    duration is at least 28 days. Results for other minimum durations (7, 14, 21,
    35 days) also yield negative point estimates.
  17: Dry spells have a direct negative impact on FAO CPI growth. The effect is observable
    when considering dry spells of at least 9 days. The impact is assessed to be additively
    separable from other stressors, and the direct effects of dry spells are larger
    than their indirect effects via drought.
  18: Main results are robust to a range of checks. Negative impacts of dry spells
    on crop production are observed regardless of heat wave duration.
  19: Dry spell days are less damaging when heat waves occur in the same year. Compounding
    effect of joint exposure to dry spells and heat waves only observed for 12+ day
    heat waves. Dry spells are more damaging in arid locations. Higher temperatures
    may exacerbate the effects of dry spells on growth in crop production.
  20: Dry spells are primarily damaging in areas with water deficits and less irrigation,
    but areas with irrigation might suffer larger FAO CPI impacts due to higher baseline
    yields and crop values.
  21: Dry spells are more damaging under annual water deficits or in arid locations,
    less harmful during heat waves, and less damaging with irrigation.
  22: The study finds that short-term water stress (dry spells) is more damaging when
    long-term water stress (drought or aridity) is present.
  23: The study finds strong evidence of non-additivity between heat waves and dry
    spells when they occur in the same year. Dry spell estimates may be influenced
    by heat, leaving less scope for detecting distinct joint exposure effects.
  24: Identifies smaller effects of dry spells in irrigated areas, consistent with
    other drought studies.
  25: It suggests nutrient management as a potential adaptation to mitigate the effects
    of hot, dry weather.
  26: Underappreciated plant vulnerabilities to heat waves; Anthropogenic warming
    has increased drought risk in California; Meta-analysis of drought and heat stress
    combination impact on crop yield and yield components.
  27: Nonlinear effects of climate change on agriculture, aggregation bias in Ricardian
    models, benefits of innovations to reduce heat and water stress, impact of drought
    on crop yields and farmland values, adaptation to groundwater and drought
  28: Greater sensitivity to drought accompanies maize yield increase in the US Midwest
    (Lobell et al., 2014). Increasing compound events of extreme hot and dry days
    during growing seasons of wheat and maize in China (Lu et al., 2018).
  31: 'Wheat yield loss attributable to heat waves, drought and water excess at the
    global, national and subnational scales.; Drought effects on US maize and soybean
    production: spatiotemporal patterns and historical changes; The impact of high
    temperature and drought stress on the yield of major staple crops in northern
    China.'
  33: More arid countries have a higher prevalence of dry spell days compared to less
    arid countries in both 1979 and 2016. A positive relationship is suggested between
    the drought index and dry spell days for more arid countries in both years.
  34: Presents summary statistics (min, mean, median, max, standard deviation) for
    various climate-related variables, including dry spell days, heat wave days, drought
    indices, aridity index, irrigation, average temperature, and annual precipitation.
  35: "Dry spell exposure is negatively correlated with crop production growth. The\
    \ correlation is stronger under drought conditions (SPEI \u2264 0) and in more\
    \ arid regions (Aridity Index below median)."
  37: The interaction between dry spell days and heat wave days (DS days x HW days)
    and the joint exposure days (DSHW) are statistically significant in many cases,
    suggesting a compounding effect. The effect of heat wave days alone increases
    substantially with the duration of the heat wave.
  38: The impact of dry spells on CPI and cereal yield varies significantly depending
    on aridity, drought conditions, and irrigation levels. In more arid regions, dry
    spells have a statistically significant negative impact on CPI, while in less
    arid regions, the impact is not statistically significant. Irrigation can moderate
    the impact of dry spells on cereal yield, although the results are not always
    statistically significant.
  39: Equation A1 models the impact of lagged dry spells, heatwaves, and drought on
    an outcome G. Equation A2 examines how the impacts of dry spells and heatwaves
    are moderated by drought or aridity, using interaction terms.
  41: The estimated marginal effects are generally negative, implying that longer
    dry spells have a negative impact on the unspecified outcome, and that these effects
    are more pronounced when heat waves are also longer. Some of the estimated effects
    are statistically significant at the 0.05 or 0.01 level, particularly for longer
    dry spell durations.
  42: Current year dry spell days have a statistically significant negative impact.
    One-year lag dry spell days have a statistically significant positive impact in
    some models. The p-value for the test that the sum of dry spell coefficients is
    zero is generally high (not statistically significant).
  43: Increased dry spell days appear to consistently have a negative impact on the
    outcome (likely productivity in agriculture, fisheries, and forestry), although
    the magnitude and statistical significance varies depending on the model specification.
  44: The table shows the controlled direct effect of an additional dry spell day
    at or above specified minimum durations (7+, 14+, 21+, 28+, 35+ days).
  46: "The effect of dry spells varies significantly depending on aridity and drought\
    \ conditions. Dry spells have statistically significant negative effects (p<0.01\
    \ or p<0.05) in regions with below-median aridity or SPEI \u2264 0."
Methodology:
  1: Multi-stressor and multi-timescale analysis
  2: Analysis is based on a global panel of daily precipitation and temperature data
    from 1979 to 2016 to assess the impact of extreme events on crop production.
  5: A panel dataset covering 1979-2016 is used to analyze the relationship between
    aggregate crop production and dry spell exposure at a country level, isolating
    country-specific dry spell exposure anomalies.
  6: Uses daily precipitation data from the Climate Prediction Center, operationalizing
    dry spell variables sensitive to the number of abnormally dry days.
  7: Defines abnormally dry days based on a cell- and day-specific threshold (1.5
    standard deviations below mean precipitation, or zero if that would be negative),
    calculated using a 31-day window. Identifies sequences of abnormally dry days.  Main
    analysis focuses on dry spells during the historically hottest 90 days in each
    grid cell. Spatial weighting is used to aggregate dry spell days to a country
    level, weighted by cropland area.
  8: Spatial averaging of dry spells, heat waves, and joint exposure. Defines heat
    waves as abnormally hot days preceded by at least k-1 others, where abnormally
    hot days are those in which temperature is at least 1.5 standard deviations above
    the mean for a grid cell and day of year. Investigates effect heterogeneity by
    constructing separate variables based on drought (SPEI), aridity index, and irrigation
    in each country and year, splitting cells into two groups based on the modifier's
    value.
  9: The study uses a 12-month SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evaporation Index)
    as a primary drought measure, and also considers start-of-season drought. Average
    temperature and precipitation are derived from the Climate Prediction Center.
    Aridity is based on the FAO's aridity index (ratio of precipitation to potential
    evapotranspiration). Irrigation data is from FAO's AQUASTAT database (circa 2005).
    National weighted exposure is constructed using the same spatial weighting scheme
    as for the dry spell variable.
  10: The analysis adjusts for the lagged log of agricultural value added per capita.
    Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are excluded due to concerns over data quality.
  11: Fixed effects models relating growth in the FAO CPI in a country and year to
    dry spell exposure; examining subsamples that vary with background water stress
    (aridity index and SPEI)
  12: Regression analysis with country and year fixed effects, adjusting for temperature,
    precipitation, and country-specific time trends. The primary model is equation
    (1). Distributed lag models are used to assess the persistence of dry spell effects.
  13: The analysis uses regression models (equations 2, 3, and 4) to estimate the
    impact of dry spells, heat waves, drought, and aridity on the outcome G. The models
    include interaction terms to capture the combined effects of dry spells and heat
    waves, as well as the modifying effects of drought and aridity. An alternative
    approach of interacting dry spell and heat wave variables with country-level drought
    and aridity, or splitting the sample based on these factors, is mentioned and
    implemented in the Appendix. The analysis leverages within-country differences.
  15: The authors use ordinary least squares with country and year fixed effects (demeaning)
    and clustered standard errors. They also employ sequential g-estimation to address
    the concern that drought may lie on the causal path between dry spells and crop
    production. Bootstrapping is used for inference in the sequential g-estimation.
  16: The analysis employs a series of alternative specifications to examine the robustness
    of dry spell estimates, including adjustments for lagged agricultural output,
    dry spell and heat wave effects, flexible temperature and precipitation effects,
    time trends, crop weighting, and alternative drought measures (SPEI).
  17: The analysis uses models that adjust for annual precipitation. The effects of
    dry spells are examined in the context of drought, aridity, and heat waves. The
    potential role of irrigation in mitigating the effects of dry spells is explored.
  18: Regression analysis (equation 2), sequential g-estimation.
  19: "Regression analysis of the effects of dry spells, heat waves, and their interaction\
    \ on crop production; considering different definitions of dry spells (hottest\
    \ 90 days, hottest 120 days, full year) and locations with aridity index \u2264\
    \ 0.65."
  20: The study uses spatial averaging with national aridity and drought measures
    along with sequential g-estimation to assess the effects of dry spells on agricultural
    productivity.
  22: The analysis uses a multi-crop, global scope approach to assess the external
    validity of various studies.
  23: Analysis is based on globally gridded temperature and precipitation data and
    aggregate crop production on an annual, national scale, with fixed thresholds
    and durations for stressors. Models considering dry spells in other parts of the
    year yielded weaker results. Analysis is at a country scale.
  24: Exploration of adaptation is preliminary, with emphasis on irrigation data limitations
    and endogeneity challenges.
  27: Ricardian models, spatial aggregation, drought monitoring, economic analysis
  28: Continental, integrated analysis for Europe (Lehner et al., 2006). Spatiotemporal
    drought analysis by the standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized
    precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) in Sichuan Province, China (Liu
    et al., 2021).
  31: Spatiotemporal patterns and historical changes (for US maize and soybean drought
    effects)
  33: The analysis compares the relationship between heat stress and water stress
    (at multiple timescales) across countries in 1979 and 2016. Countries are separated
    into more arid and less arid groups based on the median country-level aridity
    index.
  34: Summary statistics are calculated at the observation level for all variables,
    whether or not it is time-invariant for a given country (aridity, irrigation).
  35: "Correlations are computed between within-country demeaned FAO CPI growth rates\
    \ and within-country demeaned dry spell days for 28+ day dry spells using panel\
    \ bootstrap with 1000 replicates. The analysis is stratified by SPEI (\u2264 0\
    \ vs. > 0) and Aridity Index (below vs. above the country-level median of 0.997)."
  37: "The analysis uses Equation (2) to estimate the effects of dry spell days, heat\
    \ wave days, their interaction, and joint exposure days. All specifications use\
    \ 28+ day dry spells. Standard errors are clustered at the country level. The\
    \ table compares a typical interaction term approach (\U0001D6FC4 = 0) with one\
    \ that estimates \U0001D6FC4 (joint dry spell and heat wave occurrence)."
  38: Regression analysis allowing the effects of dry spells to vary with aridity,
    drought, or irrigation. Thresholds for aridity index (0.65), SPEI (0), and area
    equipped for irrigation (median among cells with nonzero irrigation) are used
    to categorize areas. Standard errors are clustered at the country level.
  39: Distributed lag models (Equation A1) with up to 5 lags of environmental variables;
    split-sample and interaction-term regressions (Equation A2) to examine how dry
    spell effects depend on drought and aridity; country-level variation used as moderators
  41: The analysis estimates the effect of an additional dry spell day using "Equation
    (1) in the main text," clustered standard errors at the country level, and considers
    different minimum durations for defining dry spells and heat waves. Statistical
    significance is indicated by *, **, and *** for p < 0.1, p < 0.05, and p < 0.01,
    respectively.
  42: Distributed lag model estimation using variants of equation (1). Standard errors
    are clustered at the country level. The models include environmental variables
    (dry spell days, heat wave days, and drought, as well as temperature, precipitation,
    and their squares) as current-year variables and lagged forms from 1 to 5 years.
    Columns (1)-(5) successively introduce additional lags. Estimates reflect the
    effect of the given lag of an additional dry spell day in a specification with
    28+ day dry spells and 9+ day heat waves.
  43: The analysis uses variants of a baseline specification (equation (1) in the
    main text) and includes controls for heat waves (minimum duration of 9 days).
    Standard errors are clustered at the country level. Models vary in temporal weighting
    of dry spell and heat wave measures, SPEI quantification, temperature adjustments,
    polynomial terms for precipitation and temperature, trends, lagged environmental
    variables, and inclusion of lagged value added per capita in agriculture.
  44: Sequential g-estimation to account for the potential influence of dry spells
    on the 12-month SPEI. Estimates control for the number of heat wave days using
    a minimum heat wave duration of 9 days. 95% confidence intervals estimated via
    panel bootstrap.
  46: 'Uses split-sample estimation and interaction terms to analyze the heterogeneous
    effects of dry spells based on country-level aridity index (median 0.997) and
    SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index). Two specifications
    are used: one allowing all covariate effects to differ by subsample, and another
    allowing only dry spell effects to differ.'
More Notes:
  1: The pie chart image likely represents a breakdown of some aspect of the analysis,
    but without labels, it's impossible to determine what it signifies. The article
    focuses on the relationship between dry spells and global crop production.
  4: The page emphasizes the interdependence of dry spell and extreme heat effects
    on crops and the need for more research on how joint water and heat stress influences
    agricultural output.
  7: Supplementary analyses consider dry days during the hottest 120 days, any time
    of year, and weighting by cereal crops as an alternative to weighting by total
    cropland.
  8: Heat waves are defined as far more rare than dry spells.
  9: No relevant information
  10: The study focuses on relatively rare events like dry spells and heat waves.
    The analysis aims to isolate the effects of punctuated weather events from prevailing
    climate regimes, trends, and droughts.
  11: Differences in the correlation across subsamples are not statistically significant,
    but their sign is consistent with water stress at different timescales having
    compounding effects.
  12: The analysis investigates interactive effects of dry spells and heat waves in
    subsequent models (not shown on this page).
  13: The variables MD, LD, MA, and LA represent exposure to dry spells and heat waves
    in more/less drought-stricken or arid cells. The Appendix (Table A4) contains
    additional analysis using country-level drought and aridity.
  15: The concern addressed is that drought may be a mediator variable, and that OLS
    estimation might induce spurious correlations between dry spells and CPI growth.
  18: The impact of dry spells may vary with exposure to heat waves, though evidence
    is mixed. Estimates including log value added per capita are somewhat smaller
    in magnitude.
  19: The paper suggests that the dry spells variable may already embed heat effects
    by focusing on exposure during the hottest part of the year.
  23: The analysis has limitations due to the use of gridded data and aggregate crop
    production, as well as the enforcement of single thresholds and durations for
    stressors. There are potential shortcomings in estimates of impacts of dry spells
    in Sub-Saharan Africa due to data limitations.
  33: The size of data points in the scatter plots is determined by the number of
    heat wave days.
  34: The table includes summary statistics for dry spells of varying lengths (7 to
    35 days) and heat waves of varying lengths (3 to 12 days).
  35: The confidence intervals suggest some results might not be statistically significant.
  37: The outcome variable being analyzed is not explicitly stated on this page. The
    data includes 4072 observations. The p-values are indicated with stars.
  38: 'The analysis distinguishes between crop area and cereal area/production when
    aggregating to the country level. Statistical significance levels are indicated
    by asterisks (*: p<0.1, **: p<0.05, ***: p<0.01).'
  39: The outcome variable G is not explicitly defined on this page.
  41: The table presents marginal effects, not absolute effects. The specific units
    and context of these effects are not clear from the table alone and likely require
    information from the main text. The negative sign of the effects does not necessarily
    indicate harm, as the outcome being evaluated is not specified.
  42: The dependent variable in equation (1) is not specified on this page. The authors
    are testing the null hypothesis that there is no growth effect of dry spells (only
    a level effect).
  43: The different model specifications test the robustness of the baseline results.
    Some specifications use alternative outcome measures (log of value added per capita).
  44: The dependent variable is not identified.
  46: The outcome being evaluated is not explicitly stated on this page.

    (Lobell et al., 2020). Maize yield increase in the US Midwest (Lobell et al.,
    2014). Climate trends and global crop production since 1980 (Lobell et al., 2011).
  31: Wheat yield loss attributable to heat waves, drought and water excess at the
    global, national and subnational scales.
  33: The study quantifies heat stress as the number of heat wave days at or beyond
    the minimum duration of 9 days. Short-term water stress is quantified as the number
    of dry spell days at or beyond the minimum duration of 28 days. Medium-term water
    stress is quantified by the 12-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration
    Index (SPEI). Long-term water stress is quantified by the country-level aridity
    index.
  34: Summary statistics (Min, Mean, Median, Max, SD) for Dry spell days, Heat wave
    days, Drought (SPEI), Aridity Index, Irrigation, Avg. Temp. (C), and Annual Precip.
    (m) are provided.
  35: Correlations between dry spell exposure and crop production growth are reported,
    including mean correlations and 95% confidence intervals, stratified by SPEI and
    Aridity Index. For example, the mean correlation for all data is -0.045 (-0.087,
    -0.004).
  37: The table provides coefficients representing the estimated effects of dry spell
    days, heat wave days, their interaction, and joint exposure days on an unspecified
    outcome variable. The coefficients and standard errors are presented for various
    heat wave durations (3+, 6+, 9+, and 12+ days).
  38: Estimated effects of an additional dry spell day on CPI and cereal yield, with
    specific values provided for areas with varying aridity, drought, and irrigation
    levels (e.g., CPI changes ranging from -0.0016 to 0.0005).
  39: No relevant information
  41: The table provides quantitative estimates of the marginal effect of an additional
    dry spell day under different combinations of minimum dry spell duration and minimum
    heat wave duration. The estimates are small negative numbers (e.g., -0.0001 to
    -0.0013), with standard errors in parentheses.
  42: Estimates of the impact of current and lagged dry spell days, p-values for the
    sum of coefficients, number of observations.
  43: The estimated effect of an additional dry spell day ranges from -0.0007 to -0.0014,
    with standard errors between 0.0005 and 0.0007. Statistical significance is indicated
    by *, **, and ***, with p < 0.1, p < 0.05, and p < 0.01, respectively.  The number
    of observations ranges from 3153 to 4072.
  44: For example, an additional dry spell day of 21+ days is associated with a -0.0009
    change (p<0.05), with a 95% confidence interval of (-0.0018, -0.00002).
  46: 'Provides estimates of the effect of an additional dry spell day under varying
    aridity and drought conditions. Effects range from approximately -0.0017 to 0.0003,
    with varying levels of statistical significance (***: p<0.01, **: p<0.05, *: p<0.1).'
