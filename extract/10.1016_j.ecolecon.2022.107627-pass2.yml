  21: "Dry spell days, annual water deficits (SPEI \u2264 0), aridity (aridity index\
    \ \u2264 0.65)"
  29: ''

    water stress conditions are investigated.
  36: Dry spell day, Heat wave day, Drought (SPEI), Mean Temperature, (Mean Temperature)^2,
    Total Precipitation, (Total Precipitation)^2
  37: Dry spell days and heat wave days are the drivers of risk.
  38: Dry spells (defined as 28+ days with heat waves of 9 or more days), moderated
    by aridity, drought (SPEI), and irrigation
  41: The shocks impacting outcomes are additional dry spell days combined with varying
    minimum durations of dry spells and heat waves.
  42: Dry spell days (current and lagged).
  43: Additional dry spell day with a minimum duration of 28 days and heat wave of

Highlights:
  2: 4-5 week dry spells during the hottest part of the year depress crop production;
    effects are modified by drought, aridity, and heat waves; losses are concentrated
    in areas without irrigation.
  5: Dry spells should lower growth in crop production, with effects that are larger
    in magnitude when dry spells co-occur with heat waves, drought, or aridity.
  11: Growth rates in the FAO CPI are significantly negatively correlated with exposure
    to dry spells, particularly in more arid countries and drier years.
  12: The study focuses on the direct effect of dry spells on the growth rate in the
    FAO CPI. The effects of dry spells on FAO CPI growth are primarily transitory.
  13: The paper aims to quantify the differential effects of combined exposure to
    dry spells and heat waves compared to individual exposure, and to assess how drought
    and aridity modify the impacts of dry spells and heat waves.
  16: Dry spells of at least 28 days have significant negative effects on crop production
    growth.
  17: Dry spells are associated with lower growth in the FAO CPI, and the effect is
    interpreted as a direct effect of dry spells.
  18: Main results hold across a range of robustness checks; There are negative main
    effects of an additional day in a 28+ day dry spell on growth in crop production
    regardless of the minimum duration chosen for heat waves.
  19: Dry spell days are less damaging when heat waves occur in the same year. Simultaneous
    exposure to dry spells and heat waves only shows a compounding effect for 12+
    day heat waves. The effects of dry spells are more damaging in more arid locations.
  20: Dry spells are primarily damaging in countries and years in which an aggregate
    annual water deficit occurs. Dry spells are damaging when they occur in cells
    with less area equipped for irrigation, though only after mitigating potential
    effects of irrigation on crop choice and baseline productivity. Farms using irrigation
    may grow higher-value crops and enjoy higher baseline yields. Thus, even if irrigation
    lowers the probability of crop loss from a dry spell, any losses that do occur
    in irrigated areas could have larger effects on the FAO CPI.
  21: Dry spell days have a modest average direct effect on growth in crop production;
    Dry spell days are more damaging when they occur in locations that are experiencing
    annual water deficits or are arid; Dry spells are less damaging in areas more
    equipped for irrigation.
  29: No relevant information
  35: "Significant negative correlation between drought conditions (SPEI \u2264 0)\
    \ and crop production growth."
  36: An additional day in a dry spell has a negative estimated direct effect on growth
    in FAO CPI.
  37: The impact of dry spells is significantly affected by the occurrence of heat
    waves. In some specifications, the joint occurrence of dry spells and heat waves
    (DSHW) has a significant negative impact, notably in column (8) with a coefficient
    of -0.1845 (significant at p<0.05).
  38: The impact of dry spells on CPI and cereal yield varies significantly depending
    on the level of aridity, drought, and irrigation. For example, in more arid areas,
    an additional dry spell day has a statistically significant negative impact on
    CPI (-0.0013**), while in less arid areas, the impact is smaller and not statistically
    significant (0.0005). The presence of irrigation can mitigate the negative impacts
    of dry spells on cereal yield, or even create positive effects.
  42: Current year dry spell days have a statistically significant (p<0.05) negative
    impact on growth, with a coefficient of approximately -0.0012. One-year lagged
    dry spell days have a statistically significant positive impact on growth in some
    model specifications (p<0.1 or p<0.05).
  44: Dry spell days of 21+ days duration and longer have statistically significant
    negative effects.
  45: The estimated effect of a dry spell day on FAO CPI growth is generally negative,
    suggesting that more dry spell days are associated with lower growth in the FAO
    CPI. The significance and magnitude of the effect vary depending on the specification
    used (e.g., the time period considered and whether the data is weighted by cropped
    area).
  46: "The effect of dry spells appears to be statistically significant (p<0.01 or\
    \ p<0.05) and negative in areas with below-median aridity or when SPEI \u2264\
    \ 0, but not in areas with above-median aridity or when SPEI > 0."
  47: The impact of a dry spell day varies depending on the 12-month SPEI value. The
    effect is statistically significant and negative when SPEI is -2, -1, and 0, and
    weakly positive when SPEI is 1 and 2.
Methodology:
  2: Global panel data analysis of daily precipitation and temperature from 1979-2016
    to assess the impact of dry spells on crop production.
  5: Statistical approach isolates country-specific dry spell exposure anomalies;
    investigates whether irrigation availability moderates the effects of dry spells
    on growth in crop production
  6: Uses daily precipitation totals from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) spanning
    1979 to 2016, gridded to 0.5-degree latitude and longitude.
  10: The analysis accounts for prevailing climate regimes, trends, and droughts when
    attempting to isolate the effects of punctuated weather events.
  11: "Fixed effects models relating growth in the FAO CPI in a country and year to\
    \ dry spell exposure. Analysis of subsamples based on aridity index (above/below\
    \ median) and SPEI (\u2264 0 vs. > 0)."
  12: Regression analysis with country and year fixed effects, controlling for average
    temperature, precipitation, and country-specific quadratic time trends. Distributed
    lag variants are also estimated.
  13: "Regression analysis using fixed effects models (\U0001D707\U0001D456 and \U0001D719\
    \U0001D461 represent country and time fixed effects, respectively). The models\
    \ examine the impact of dry spells, heat waves, drought, and aridity on the outcome\
    \ of interest (G_it). Different specifications capture simultaneous and co-located\
    \ exposure to dry spells and heat waves, and the modification of dry spell and\
    \ heat wave effects by drought and aridity."
  16: Regression analysis with alternative specifications to test robustness, including
    adjustments for lagged variables, temperature and precipitation, and time trends.
    G-estimation and SPEI are considered for dealing with the influence of dry spells
    on drought.
  17: Regression models that adjust for annual precipitation; robustness checks are
    performed in the Appendix.
  18: Regression analysis using equation (2); robustness checks include alternative
    covariates, alternate outcomes, and sequential g-estimation
  19: Regression analysis using equations (3) and (4). Re-estimation of baseline model
    with different definitions of dry spells (hottest 90 days vs. hottest 120 days
    or full year).
  20: Regression analysis using cross-country variation in national aridity or drought,
    sequential g-estimation.
  21: Observational study examining the relationship between dry spell exposure and
    growth in crop production at a national scale.

  35: Correlations computed using within-country demeaned data on FAO CPI growth rates
    and dry spell days for 28+ day dry spells, employing a panel bootstrap with 1000
    replicates.
  36: Baseline model estimates effects of explanatory variables in equation (1), omitting
    fixed effects, year effects, and trends. Standard errors are clustered at the
    country level. Results are for minimum dry spell durations of 7, 14, 21, 28, and
    35 days.
  37: The analysis uses a regression model (Equation 2) to estimate the effects of
    dry spell days, heat wave days, and their interaction. Standard errors are clustered
    at the country level. The analysis considers different minimum durations to define
    heat waves. It uses 28+ day dry spells.
  38: Regression analysis (equations 3, 4, and 5) is used to estimate the effects
    of dry spells on CPI and cereal yield, allowing for heterogeneity based on aridity,
    drought, and irrigation. Standard errors are clustered at the country level.
  41: Analysis uses calculation of marginal effects for combinations of dry spell
    and heat wave durations, with standard errors clustered at the country level.
  42: Distributed lag model estimation, variants of equation (1) in the main text.
    Environmental variables (dry spell days, heat wave days, and drought, as well
    as temperature, precipitation, and their squares) enter not only as current-year
    variables, but also in lagged form from 1 to 5 years. Standard errors are clustered
    at the country level. Results are applicable to specifications with 28+ day dry
    spells and 9+ day heat waves.
  43: Analysis uses baseline specification with various model variants adjusting for
    factors like growing season weights, cubic and quartic terms, temperature bins,
    lags of environmental variables, and economic value-added adjustments.
  44: Sequential g-estimation with panel bootstrap to estimate the effect of dry spells
    controlling for heat wave days.
  45: The analysis uses variants of equation (1) to estimate the effect of dry spell
    days on FAO CPI growth. Dry spell and heat wave variables are constructed using
    different subsets of days in the year (hottest 90 days, hottest 120 days, and
    all days). The analysis is performed both with and without weighting days temporally
    by cropped area using the MIRCA2000 dataset. Standard errors are clustered at
    the country level.
  46: The analysis uses split-sample estimation and interaction terms to assess the
    heterogeneous effects of dry spells based on country-level aridity (median value
    of 0.997) and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index). The
    models also include the number of heat wave days.
  47: Sequential g-estimation is used to account for the potential influence of dry
    spells on the 12-month SPEI. Panel bootstrap is used to calculate confidence intervals.
More Notes:
  2: The study considers multi-stressor and multi-timescale perspectives, focusing
    on punctuated events rather than long-term phenomena and studies extreme heat
    or precipitation in isolation.
  5: Uses the FAO Crop Production Index (FAO CPI) as a key variable.
  10: The dataset excludes countries in Sub-Saharan Africa due to data quality concerns.
    The dataset includes 118 countries.
  11: The authors investigate the possibility of compounding effects of water stress
    at different timescales.
  13: The page describes the econometric models used in the paper but lacks specific
    details on the data, variables (beyond dry spells, heatwaves, drought and aridity)
    or empirical results. The paper uses within-country differences to leverage greater
    variation in climate variables.
  15: The study attempts to address the potential endogeneity of drought by using
    sequential g-estimation to estimate controlled direct effects of dry spells on
    CPI growth.
  17: The paper also explores the potential role of irrigation in mitigating the effects
    of dry spells, but this is not detailed on this page.
  18: The effects of dry spells may vary with exposure to heat waves. Models including
    log value added per capita in agriculture, fisheries, and forestry are somewhat
    smaller in magnitude.
  19: The paper suggests that high temperatures (even without prolonged heat waves)
    exacerbate the effects of dry spells on crop production. The interaction term
    between dry spells and heat waves is positive, but the overall damage from hot
    and dry weather is still larger when heat waves occur.
  21: The study finds that the effects of dry spell days vary with the presence of
    other stressors, such as annual water deficits, aridity, and irrigation.
  29: No relevant information
  36: The estimated direct effect on growth in FAO CPI is for having an additional
    day in a dry spell, when dry spells must last at least the number of days specified
    in each column header to be considered a dry spell.
  37: The dependent variable is not explicitly named, so the interpretation of the
    coefficients is limited. The table examines heterogeneity in dry spell impacts
    with different levels of heat wave exposure.
  38: The thresholds for aridity index, SPEI, and area equipped for irrigation are
    0.65, 0, and the median among all cells with nonzero irrigation, respectively.
    The analysis uses area-weighted and production-weighted averages to aggregate
    to the country level.
