Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme temperatures due to climate change, specifically increasing heat events.
  2: Environmental heat exposure
  3: Daily maximum temperature (Tmax), hourly wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT).
  4: Increased Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) due to climate change, impacting
    outdoor and indoor working conditions.
  5: Climate change, temperature increases
  6: Climate change, specifically heat stress due to rising temperatures under different
    Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).
  8: Heat events, climate change (specifically RCP8.5 high-greenhouse-gas emissions
    pathway)
  9: Climate change, increasing temperature, heat stress, heatwaves, environmental
    summer heat exposure
  10: Climate change, heat exposure, rising temperatures, heatwaves.
  11: Climate change, extreme heat, warming climate, heatwaves.
Highlights:
  1: Heat exposure in Switzerland currently causes ~658 deaths and CHF 665 million
    in labor productivity losses annually; under RCP8.5, productivity losses could
    triple by the end of the century.
  2: Detailed impact assessment and future projections for excess mortality and losses
    in labour productivity in Switzerland at the kilometre level for distinct population
    groups and activity classes.
  3: Increased daily maximum temperature leads to increased heat-related mortality,
    especially for those 75 and older.  Heat impacts labour productivity as measured
    by WBGT.
  4: Increased WBGT leads to a significant loss in labour productivity, with the relationship
    quantified using impact functions and a Monte Carlo simulation.
  5: Heat-related deaths in Switzerland are projected to increase significantly under
    climate change, particularly under RCP8.5. The elderly population (>= 75 years)
    is disproportionately affected.
  6: Labour productivity losses are projected to increase significantly under higher
    RCP scenarios, with the southern cantons and Basel being most impacted. High physical
    activity workers face a disproportionately higher percentage of the losses.
  8: The monetary costs of heat and mortality are already substantial and could double
    (mortality) or triple (labor productivity) by the end of the century under RCP8.5
    in Switzerland.
  9: Climate change impacts occupational health and productivity (Kjellstrom et al.,
    2009a, 2009b)
  10: Several studies focus on the impact of heat on mortality and labour productivity,
    including economic losses. Some studies use projections and scenarios to estimate
    future impacts.
  11: Heat-related mortality is attributable to recent human-induced climate change;
    Extreme heat leads to labor productivity losses and associated economic costs.
Methodology:
  1: High-resolution spatial analysis based on the IPCC risk framework (hazard, exposure,
    vulnerability) and a Monte Carlo simulation; considers no socio-economic changes.
  2: Uses the IPCC risk framework, implemented in the open-source CLIMADA impact modelling
    platform (Aznar-Siguan and Bresch, 2019), combining hazard, exposure, and vulnerability
    to quantify socio-economic impacts of natural hazards, with a Monte Carlo simulation
    to assess the uncertainties.
  3: Uses CH2018 Climate Scenarios for Switzerland (downscaled EURO-CORDEX data).
    Computes heat-related mortality by linking daily maximum temperature to excess
    mortality based on Ragettli et al. (2017) impact functions for two age categories
    (under 75, 75+). Calculates the impact of heat on labour productivity using hourly
    wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT).
  4: The analysis uses CH2018 climate data, EnergyPlus for thermal dynamic analysis
    of buildings, company structure statistics from FSO, and impact functions based
    on various studies and ISO standards to model the relationship between WBGT and
    labour productivity loss. Monte Carlo simulation is employed to address uncertainties
    in climate data and impact functions. The study differentiates between low, moderate,
    and high physical activity levels and whether work is conducted inside or outside
    buildings.
  5: Uses Monte Carlo simulations (1000 iterations) to integrate uncertainties related
    to impact functions (vulnerability). Uses RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 8.5) and considers
    different time horizons (2035, 2050, 2065, 2080).
  6: Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate labour productivity losses under different
    RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) for the years 2035, 2050, 2065, and 2080. The
    analysis considers different levels of physical activity (low and high) and their
    impact on labour productivity.
  8: IPCC risk framework, spatially explicit modeling, Monte Carlo simulation, keeps
    socio-economic factors constant
  9: Meta-analysis of performance response under thermal stressors (Hancock et al.,
    2007), globally consistent adaptation options appraisal tool (Bresch and Aznar-Siguan,
    2021).

More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on Switzerland and considers only the impact of heat on mortality
    and labor productivity; uncertainties in the model are large, but the trend in
    impacts is unequivocal.
  2: The study models heat-related impacts in Switzerland using high-resolution datasets,
    including CH2018 Climate Scenarios (NCCS, 2018) and geographical distribution
    of population and workers per hectare.
  3: Analysis focuses on Switzerland. Mortality analysis uses warm season (May-September)
    data from 1995-2013 for eight Swiss cities. Population data from the Swiss Federal
    Statistical Office (FSO) is used at the hectare level. Deaths are assumed evenly
    distributed throughout the warm season.
  4: The study focuses on Switzerland and utilizes specific datasets related to Swiss
    climate, building types, and labor statistics. The analysis considers different
    climate scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5).
  5: The study uses previous research on performance in office tasks at different
    temperatures as indicator, and also uses ISO standards for some aspects of impact
    on labour productivity.
  6: Uncertainties in the labour productivity model are larger than those in the mortality
    model due to the estimation of hourly WBGT (Wet Bulb Globe Temperature).
  8: Model could be used to analyse adaptation measures and their effectiveness.
  9: Several references concern temperature extremes and heatwaves, indicating a focus
    on the impact of rising temperatures on mortality and productivity.
  10: Many of the papers focus on European countries, with some also examining India
    and South Africa, suggesting a global scope.
  11: Several cited papers are relevant to quantifying the macroeconomic impacts of
    climate change, particularly through the impact of heat stress on health and labor
    productivity. WHO reports on heat-health action plans and warning systems could
    be relevant for adaptation strategies. Focus is mainly on the effects of heat,
    not other aspects of climate change (sea level rise, flood) and there is no cost/benefit
    analysis for adaptation
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic costs caused by losses in labour productivity.
  2: Losses in labour productivity can have important repercussions on the overall
    economy (Carleton and Hsiang, 2016; Kjellstrom et al., 2018; Dunne et al., 2013;
    Kjellstrom et al., 2009a; Zhao et al., 2021).

  4: Labour productivity loss due to heat exposure, expressed as a percentage.
  5: Labour productivity
  6: Labour productivity loss in Switzerland.
  8: Monetary costs of heat, labour productivity, mortality
  9: Mortality, labor productivity, temperature-related excess mortality
  10: Mortality, labour productivity, economic losses due to reduced outdoor worker
    productivity.
  11: Mortality, labor productivity loss, economic impact of heat-related labor productivity
    loss, costs from labor losses due to extreme heat.
Quantitative material:
  1: Economic costs of labor productivity losses amount to around CHF 665 million
    (approx. USD 700 million) per year in Switzerland currently; Mortality of about
    658 deaths are associated with heat exposure each year; Under RCP8.5, these values
    may double (mortality) or triple (labor productivity) by the end of the century;
    Under RCP2.6 impacts are expected to slightly increase and peak around mid-century.
  2: Increase in mortality of 5.4% was reported in Switzerland in the summer of 2015.
  3: Equation (1) defines the Attributable Fraction (AF) of deaths due to heat. Equation
    (2) calculates total heat-related deaths per year at a cell level. Figure 2 shows
    the relationship between daily maximum temperature and relative risk of daily
    mortality for people aged 75+.
  4: Equation (3) describes the calculation of total labor productivity loss (ILabour
    Productivity) as a function of exposed salary value (E cell) and hourly predicted
    loss in labor productivity (Loss(WBGThour)) for a given WBGT. Figure 3 illustrates
    the relationship between WBGT and percentage of labour productivity loss for moderate
    physical activity.
  5: Mentions 658 heat-related deaths per year in Switzerland in the baseline (2020,
    RCP8.5). Projects deaths increasing to 934 in 2050 and exceeding 1500 in 2080
    under RCP8.5. Gives uncertainty ranges for RCP8.5 in 2050 (241-1883 deaths).
  6: Baseline labour productivity loss is estimated at CHF 665 million per year (approx.
    USD 700 million) in 2020 under RCP8.5. In 2050, this increases to CHF 1.1 billion
    under RCP8.5, an increase of 65% compared to today. This corresponds to about
    0.24% of the total yearly exposed salary value. The 95th percentile in 2050 for
    the RCP8.5 is CHF4 billion per year.
  8: Monetary costs of heat and the effects on mortality are substantial already today.
    The magnitude of these impacts may double (for mortality) or even triple (for
    labour productivity) by the end of the century should we remain on the current
    high-greenhouse-gas emissions pathway (RCP8.5).
