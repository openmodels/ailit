Drivers of Risk:
  5: Climate change, specifically changes in daily maximum temperatures and per capita
    income variations.
  6: Maximum temperatures, shifts in climate (historical daily maximum temperature
    exposure to future climatic exposure), weather anomalies (positive and negative
    deviations from the climatic norm)
  7: Shifts in mean climate, positive weather anomalies (temperature), geographical
    heterogeneity, seasonal heterogeneity, socio-economic growth, and population changes.
  8: Climate change shifts (moving average of daily maximum temperatures) and positive
    weather anomalies (departing from the moving average) are drivers of increased
    peak load.
  9: Climate change and weather anomalies impacting peak electricity load in Europe
    and India.
  10: Increase in maximum temperatures' climate norms; unexpected variation around
    those norms; future socioeconomic and climatic shifts.
Highlights:
  5: Peak electricity demand is significantly related to maximum temperatures in a
    U-shaped relationship. Europe sees a larger increase in peak load from high temperatures
    than India.
  6: Increasing air-cooling adoption is a key adaptation strategy to cope with hotter
    climates. The long-run adjustments driven by slowly changing climatic exposure,
    including income growth effects, are roughly two times larger than shocks computed
    based on a naive weather response function. Latent, extensive margin, adjustments
    changes considerably the projected impact of climate change on the peak load.
  7: Climate change amplifies peak load on electric grids, with positive weather anomalies
    exacerbating the effect. A North-South gradient exists in Europe, with decreased
    peak load in the North and increased peak load in the South. The tropics show
    a less pronounced gradient. Socio-economic growth also contributes to the need
    to increase annual peak capacity.
  8: Climate change will significantly increase peak electricity demand in both India
    and Europe by 2050 under RCP 5-8.5. India faces a substantially larger increase
    in peak demand than Europe, both in absolute and percentage terms. Baseline annual
    peak demand in 2050 increases considerably with respect to the historical level
    in the Indian states experiencing large growth in both per capita income and population.
  9: Long-run peak load response for cooling services is always above the short-run
    response due to fixity of cooling appliances in short-run.
  10: "Both an increase in the maximum temperatures\u2019 climate norms and the inherent\
    \ unexpected variation around that norms can contribute to increasing the pressure\
    \ on the peak load in Europe and India, with respect to historical climate conditions."
Methodology:
  5: "The analysis projects the impact of mid-century temperature increases on peak\
    \ load using climate change projections from CMIP6 GCMs, per capita income projections,\
    \ and estimated parameters related to temperature response and income effects\
    \ on electricity demand. It uses gridded population data to aggregate shocks.\
    \ Equations are estimated by OLS using White standard error robust to heteroscedasticity\
    \ and, alternatively, Newey\u2013West standard errors accounting for serial correlation."
  6: The analysis uses a spline function modulated by short-run adjustment effects
    triggered by weather anomalies. It considers both extensive margin (long-run,
    adoption of air-cooling) and intensive margin (short-run) adjustments in peak
    load response.
  7: The study uses projected maximum temperatures from 25 GCMs for the period 2040-2060.
    It estimates the impact of weather anomalies by computing the standard deviation
    of future maximum temperature anomalies. The aggregation from grid-cell to country
    shocks is based on population share. Annual peak capacity is projected based on
    long-run projections of the maximum peak load in a year considering socio-economic
    growth and climate change.
  8: The analysis projects peak load demand under RCP 5-8.5 scenario around 2050,
    using 25 GCMs to model climate change impacts on peak load, distinguishing between
    the impact of mean climate shifts and weather anomalies.
  9: Analysis includes decomposition of climate and weather anomalies' impact on electricity
    demand, with long-run and short-run responses compared.
  10: The paper proposes a methodology for assessing climate change adaptation by
    identifying the average impact of long-run climatic changes and capturing the
    fast responses of peak load to unexpected weather anomalies. Results are applicable
    to understanding the effects of future conditions on the peak load based on the
    power market structure and appliance diffusion rates as of 2050.
More Notes:
  5: The paper analyzes the impacts of climate change on peak electricity demand,
    which is related to the costs of maintaining sufficient energy infrastructure
    and energy market stability.
  6: Per capita income modulates both the long-run response of the peak load and the
    short-run response to positive weather anomalies. The high-income response of
    India approaches the low-income response of Europe, despite income differences.
  7: The gradient effect weakens towards the tropics. Capacity planning relies on
    long-run projections of the maximum peak load in a year.
  8: The paper distinguishes between socio-economic drivers (income per capita growth)
    and climate change drivers when projecting future peak load. The impact of climate
    change is decomposed into mean climate shifts and weather anomalies.
  9: Projections consider extensive margin adjustments and per capita income amplification.
    Page notes potential for high frequency electric load data to expand research.
  10: The paper leaves for future work the inclusion of a weather variable accounting
    for humidity and a wider set of controls for seasonal economic activities. It
    also acknowledges that the projections depend on assumptions about appliance diffusion
    and energy efficiency, and do not account for the supply-side implications or
    grid constraints.

Quantitative material:
  5: "The long-run response of peak load to a shift in the climate from the reference\
    \ interval to maximum temperatures above 30 \u25E6C is considerably higher in\
    \ Europe (a 30% increase) than in India (an 11%\u201318% increase respectively\
    \ in the intervals 30 \u25E6C - 33 \u25E6C and above 33 \u25E6C), when per capita\
    \ income is fixed at the median level. In both Europe and India, the long-run\
    \ exposure to cold temperatures increases the peak by around 8%\u201310%."
  6: Long-run increase of the peak load of up to 12% in Europe and 15% in India under
    the RCP 5-8.5 scenario by 2050.
  7: Positive weather anomalies can result in a peak load shock of 20% in both Europe
    and India under the RCP 8.5. Southern European countries experience an exacerbation
    of summer peaks of up to 20% (33%), excluding (including) the additional effect
    of response. Northern European countries experience reductions in the peak load
    of up to -20% due to milder winters. Delhi and Goa are the states with the highest
    relative increase in daily peak load, reaching values around 30% (33%), excluding
    (including) the additional effect of positive weather anomalies.
