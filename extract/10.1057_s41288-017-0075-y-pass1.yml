Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate-related events (windstorm, flood, drought, hail, brushfire) and other
    natural catastrophes (earthquake, tsunami).
  5: Extreme events such as earthquakes, windstorms, and floods are identified as
    shocks impacting economic and insured losses.
  6: Exposure to natural catastrophes increases the perception of risk, which raises
    demand for property insurance products.
  7: Disaster losses (natural and man-made), GDP, insurance take-up rate, risk exposure,
    property concentration, consumption per capita, savings, access to technology
    (internet, mobile), Islamic Law, property rights enforceability, corruption, political
    risk.
  8: Earthquakes, floods, and windstorms; location of exposures moving to emerging
    economies; variations in insurance penetration
  9: Economic development and shifting patterns of growth to less insured high-growth
    economies; Specifically, growth in emerging economies with larger protection gaps.
  10: Windstorm, earthquake, and flood.
  11: Natural catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, wind), particularly the proportion
    of losses that are uninsured.
  12: Natural catastrophes (quake, flood, wind), level of economic development (CPC).
  14: Natural catastrophes (quake, flood, wind); Economic development (consumption
    per capita, GDP growth, savings); Socio-demographic factors (urbanization, industrial
    sector share)
  15: Natural Catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, wind), Weather-related events
  16: Natural catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, wind), driven by incomplete insurance
    coverage (underinsurance).
  17: Factors influencing macroeconomic outcomes include the lack of effective building
    codes, insufficient risk management incentives, and underinvestment in safety
    measures.
  18: Natural catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, wind) and lack of insurance coverage
    drive economic losses.
  19: Natural catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, wind), Underinsurance, Lack of Sharia-compliant
    insurance in Muslim-majority countries
  20: Natural disasters, extreme weather events, climate change
  22: Weather-related natural catastrophes
  24: Natural catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, wind), weather-related events, and
    the level of insurance penetration in relation to consumption per capita.
  25: Natural catastrophes (earthquakes, floods, wind), weather-related events.
  26: Natural catastrophes (EQ, wind, flood), Weather-related events
  28: The primary drivers of risk mentioned are natural catastrophes such as earthquakes,
    floods, and winds.
Highlights:
  1: There is a large protection gap for extreme, and particularly climate-related,
    risks; underinsurance of extreme events is significant, necessitating a detailed
    understanding of its components and root causes.
  5: Understanding and addressing the protection gap involves either reducing expected
    losses or increasing insurance coverage.
  6: Economic development is a key factor affecting insurance purchasing decisions.
    Consumption per capita is correlated to insurance demand and has a strong, positive
    impact on property insurance demand. There is a significant difference between
    uninsured and insured losses across various countries for earthquakes, floods,
    and winds.
  7: Uninsured losses from natural catastrophes are substantial in many countries,
    particularly emerging economies. Property insurance penetration is positively
    correlated with consumption per capita, but underinsurance exists relative to
    a best-practice benchmark. Internet and mobile access are expected to positively
    drive property insurance uptake. Islamic law, corruption, and political risk are
    expected to negatively impact property insurance uptake.
  8: There is a substantial natural catastrophe protection gap worldwide, with a significant
    portion of economic losses from natural disasters being uninsured; emerging markets
    have a larger protection gap than mature markets; uninsured losses as a percent
    of GDP are growing.
  9: Uninsured weather-related losses are growing faster than GDP, particularly in
    emerging economies. Economic development and the shift towards less insured high-growth
    economies are major drivers of the growth in uninsured catastrophe losses.
  10: The US, Japan, and China have the largest uninsured natural catastrophe risk.
    Smaller economies like Taiwan, Turkey, Chile, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and
    Mexico face significant risks relative to their GDP.
  11: Emerging economies are more vulnerable to disruptions caused by uninsured catastrophes.
    Underinsurance is identified by the gap between actual insurance penetration and
    a 'best-practice benchmark' relative to consumption per capita.
  12: Middle-income economies are most underinsured relative to GDP; Significant underinsurance
    exists in many countries.
  14: Prior economic growth has a negative impact on insurance penetration, suggesting
    a lag in insurance development in fast-growing economies; Savings and insurance
    act as substitutes; Urbanization and the share of the industrial sector positively
    impact insurance penetration; Significant differences exist between uninsured
    and insured losses across countries for natural catastrophes; Underinsurance is
    prevalent relative to best-practice benchmarks.
  15: HAZARD (recent cat losses) is positively correlated with insurance penetration;
    MORTGAGE penetration significantly increases insurance penetration; uninsured
    losses are higher in emerging economies compared to advanced economies
  16: There are significant uninsured losses globally, particularly in emerging markets.
    The gap between actual and best-practice insurance penetration suggests underinsurance
    is prevalent.
  17: Enhanced building codes and zoning can reduce expected losses from natural disasters,
    with potential property value increases from safety investments.
  18: There is a significant difference between uninsured and insured losses across
    various countries. Underinsurance is identified as a critical issue, especially
    in emerging economies. Digital and mobile distribution can leapfrog access to
    insurance in countries where no traditional distribution system has developed
    yet. The graph shows trends in uninsured losses due to weather-related events
    across different economic categories over time.
  19: Mandatory insurance schemes can form the widest possible risk community and
    eliminate adverse selection, leading to reduced distribution and transaction costs
    and cross-subsidization of higher-risk policyholders. Turkey's improved earthquake
    coverage take-up after 2012 demonstrates the effectiveness of linking insurance
    to essential services and rebuilding aid.
  20: Countries with higher insurance penetration had lower indirect costs and a faster
    economic recovery after natural catastrophe events. Governments in emerging markets
    can reduce fiscal vulnerability to disasters by taking contingent costs of natural
    catastrophe damage off government balance-sheets and into the capital markets.
  21: Most of the historic growth of weather-related economic and insured losses can
    be attributed to economic development and the shift of growth to less-insured
    lower-income economies.
  22: The provided visuals highlight the significant difference between uninsured
    and insured losses across various countries for earthquakes, floods, and winds,
    as well as trends in uninsured losses as a percentage of GDP over time for advanced,
    emerging, and global contexts.
  24: Significant differences exist in insured and uninsured losses across countries
    and types of disasters. Underinsurance is prevalent in many regions compared to
    best-practice benchmarks. Uninsured losses as a percentage of GDP vary across
    advanced, emerging, and global economies over time.
  25: Significant differences exist between uninsured and insured losses across countries
    and disaster types. Underinsurance is a notable problem, as indicated by gaps
    between actual and best-practice insurance penetration. Uninsured losses as a
    percentage of GDP show different trends for advanced and emerging economies.
  26: The bar chart emphasizes the significant difference between uninsured and insured
    losses across various countries for earthquakes, floods, and winds, notably with
    the USA, Japan, and China having the highest expected losses, predominantly uninsured.
    Uninsured losses as % of GDP (10-yr avg) indicates how losses due to natural disasters
    have changed over time, broken down by advanced, emerging, and global contexts,
    revealing trends like peak uninsured losses for emerging economies around 2000.
  28: The USA has the highest expected property damage losses, with significant uninsured
    exposure, highlighting the gap between actual and optimal insurance penetration.
Methodology:
  1: Uses historical loss data, probabilistic models, and regression analysis on a
    panel dataset of 53 countries over 15 years to estimate the protection gap and
    identify factors affecting property insurance demand.
  5: The analysis involves calculating protection gaps by subtracting insured losses
    from economic losses across various countries and event types; this is done using
    data from 2015, and does not account for changes due to climate scenarios or economic
    development.
  6: The study models the estimated gap between expected losses and insurance coverage
    based on simulation and industry data. An empirical test is performed to identify
    significant determinants of property insurance penetration. Trends in uninsured
    losses are analyzed by plotting them as % of GDP over time for advanced, emerging,
    and global categories.
  7: The paper uses historical data from Swiss Re, Oxford Economics, and the World
    Bank to analyze the determinants of property insurance penetration and the impact
    of natural catastrophes. The analysis appears to involve regression analysis with
    various economic and institutional factors as explanatory variables.
  8: Analysis of historical data (Swiss Re's sigma data and global cat loss database)
    to determine trends in natural catastrophe losses and insurance gaps; Guy Carpenter's
    regional cat price indices used as a proxy for property insurance prices.
  9: Analysis of trends in uninsured natural catastrophe losses as a percentage of
    GDP over time, comparing emerging and mature economies. Cross-section data analysis
    is used to estimate the GDP elasticity of premium volumes.
  10: Monte Carlo simulation tool used to estimate expected losses. The tool generates
    global hazard maps for windstorm, earthquake, and flood. A vulnerability module
    relates the expected damage of various insured objects to the intensity of the
    modelled events. Data on the value of insured objects is added to yield the expected
    economic loss potential. Information about insurance market conditions is combined
    with the expected economic loss to estimate what proportion of the loss is insured.
  11: Probabilistic assessment of the global natural catastrophe property protection
    gap is done by extrapolating results from a sample of countries to missing countries
    in proportion to GDP. Insurance penetration (direct premiums as a percentage of
    GDP) is used as a metric for insurance demand and is related to consumption per
    capita.
  12: Uses a logistic model to estimate a 'best-practice benchmark' for insurance
    penetration based on cross-sectional data of 45 countries; Underinsurance is calculated
    as the difference between the best-practice benchmark insurance penetration and
    actual penetration, multiplied by GDP; Countries are grouped into low, medium,
    and high consumption per capita categories. Estimates 'shortfalls' and extrapolates
    these.
  14: Multivariate panel data analysis using annual data from 2000-2015 for 51 countries;
    Log-log, log-linear, and random effects model specifications to assess the robustness
    of variables; Analysis of trends in insurance buying behavior

    assess expected property damage losses and insurance penetration.
More Notes:
  1: The paper defines the 'protection gap' as the uninsured portion of losses and
    'underinsurance' as the difference between economically beneficial insurance and
    the amount purchased.
  6: Urbanization, mortgage penetration, access to the formal financial sector, and
    domestic credit to the private sector are expected to be positively correlated
    with property insurance penetration. Savings can function as a substitute for
    insurance.
  7: The study uses Swiss Re's sigma database for disaster losses, which requires
    a threshold of USD 48.8 million in insured claims or USD 97.7 million in total
    economic losses for inclusion.
  9: The data for emerging markets is strongly influenced by several large earthquakes
    in the 1970s and 1980s, which elevate the base (10-year averages) and lower long-term
    growth rates.
  10: The analysis focuses on property damage losses and the insurance protection
    gap. The model inputs total estimated value at risk, which is similar to the model
    that would be used by a property underwriter but instead of an insured client's
    portfolio.
  11: 'The USD 153 billion estimate has shortcomings: it may overestimate the protection
    gap due to inclusion of some public infrastructure and commercial property where
    self-insurance may be preferred, but it underestimates the gap since perils like
    hail, drought, tornadoes, mudslides and volcanoes are not included in the probabilistic
    models.'
  12: The analysis suggests that risk perceptions, buying behavior, and market structure
    barriers contribute to underinsurance; The 'best-practice benchmark' is derived
    from the top quartile of insurance penetration within each consumption group.
  14: The analysis controls for inflation and exchange rate fluctuations by normalizing
    property premiums by GDP. The panel data set accounts for about 90% of the world's
    GDP.
  15: The paper explores factors influencing insurance penetration, which is considered
    a proxy for resilience against natural disasters. The analysis considers financial,
    demographic, and digital distribution factors. Availability bias may affect risk
    perception.
  16: The paper identifies different types of underinsurance (entirely uninsured,
    perils not covered, restrictive terms, undervalued) and suggests strategies to
    address each.
  17: Insurance industry and government roles are pivotal in risk reduction through
    standards enforcement and incentivizing mitigation investments.
  18: Product bundling and simple policy wording can improve insurance penetration.
    Trust in the insurance provider is a key determinant of insurance demand.
  19: The text highlights the potential of index-based insurance and takaful to address
    underinsurance issues. It also identifies key factors for a thriving takaful industry,
    including a comprehensive regulatory framework and availability of Sharia-compliant

    transfer mechanisms like catastrophe bonds. It also highlights the issue of underinsurance
    in some regions.
  22: The paper focuses on property insurance and its relationship to economic indicators
    and disaster losses. The analysis distinguishes between advanced and emerging
    economies.
  25: The page focuses on the role of insurance in mitigating the macroeconomic impacts
    of natural disasters, emphasizing the importance of understanding and addressing
    underinsurance. The analysis uses graphs showing both static and dynamic trends
    in relevant variables.
  26: The study uses a cross-country panel dataset, potentially enabling cross-sectional
    analysis of the factors driving macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks related to
    climate change. The scatter plots illustrate the relationship between insurance
    penetration and consumption per capita, highlighting the concept of 'underinsurance'.
