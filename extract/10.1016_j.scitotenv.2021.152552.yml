Drivers of Risk:
  1: The paper discusses natural hazards affected by climate change, changes in future
    exposure including population growth, land use, and infrastructure, as well as
    future physical vulnerabilities.
  2: This paper identifies global population growth, urbanization, wealth disparities,
    and climate change as key drivers impacting the future risk of natural hazards.
  4: Future exposure to natural hazards will be driven by increases in population
    (such as urbanization), socioeconomic growth, and choices on land use.
  5: Unplanned/informal modifications, maintenance/degradation challenges, environment-induced
    deterioration (corrosion), accumulation of damage due to cascading hazard events
    (e.g., aftershocks).
  6: No relevant information
  7: Dynamic nature of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability are mentioned as key risk
    drivers. Natural climate variability, greenhouse gas emissions, climate change,
    extreme weather, population size, economic growth, and planned adaptation.
Evaluation overview:

    methods and approaches to quantify and model risk from natural hazards in future
    scenarios.

  7: "Impacts on GDP, investment, and international trade \uFB02ows from sea-level\
    \ rise are mentioned."
Highlights:
  1: The paper emphasizes the importance of preparing for future disasters and discusses
    the risk-modelling challenges affecting decision making.
  2: This review specifically relates to natural hazards classified as geophysical,
    hydrological, climatological, and meteorological, assessing the dynamics of vulnerability
    and exposure due to socioeconomic processes and climate change.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Future exposure to natural hazards will be influenced by increases in urbanization,
    socioeconomic growth, and fluctuations in land-use choices.
  5: Vulnerability can increase due to degradation and unplanned modifications, or
    decrease through adaptation measures (climate adaptation engineering). Rising
    carbon dioxide levels increase the likelihood of carbonation-induced corrosion.
    Time-dependent fragility functions and dynamic seismic reliability profiles for
    environmentally degraded reinforced concrete bridges can be computed.
  6: No relevant information
  7: There remains a lack of a commonly accepted analytical framework for complete
    end-to-end risk quantification.
Methodology:
  1: The paper focuses on modelling and quantifying future risks by examining individual
    components of risk including hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.
  2: The paper examines future natural hazard risk by modeling the components of hazard,
    exposure, and vulnerability from a physical sciences and engineering perspective.
  3: Future climate-related hazards are modeled by combining emission scenarios with
    climate models, downscaling the results, simulating dynamic weather variables,
    deriving hazardous events, and calculating local intensities. This process can
    be repeated for many temporal instances to generate frequency exceedance curves.
  4: Future population and economic growth are commonly modelled on the basis of socioeconomic
    scenario storylines.
  5: Discusses modeling urban growth using methods such as cellular automata (CA),
    agent-based modeling (ABM), Markov chain methods, empirical/semi-empirical methods,
    landscape metrics, machine learning, coupled Markov chain-genetic algorithm models,
    and weight of evidence. Mentions using population and economic growth projections
    to constrain urban expansion models. Also discusses modeling time-dependent earthquake
    fragility and environment-induced deterioration using finite element models, statistical
    models, and systems reliability theory.
  6: No relevant information
  7: Discusses the challenges of modeling future risk, including uncertainties in
    hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. It points out inconsistencies in approaches
    for calculating future loss projections.
More Notes:
  3: The page describes a typical methodological approach to modeling future climate-related
    hazards, showing the flow from emissions scenarios to local intensity calculation,
    as well as describing the downscaling process.
  4: The page primarily discusses modeling future exposure to natural hazards by considering
    population growth, socioeconomic factors, and land use changes, and modeling them
    on the basis of socioeconomic scenario storylines.
