Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change; Population growth; Asset wealth accumulation; Urbanisation; Interconnectedness;
    Natural hazards (affected by climate change); Future exposure (population, land
    use, built environment); Evolving physical vulnerabilities of infrastructure.
  3: Future emissions from scenario storylines drive climate models, which in turn
    drive dynamic weather variables and hazardous events. Dynamic hazard features
    such as annual maximum discharges and windspeeds are also drivers of risk. Changes
    in ground cover (e.g., deforestation) drive flooding and landslide hazards.
Highlights:
  1: Explores work that has modeled and quantified future risks from natural hazards,
    focusing on hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. Discusses risk-modelling challenges
    and their effect on decision making.
  3: The core methodological steps involve emission scenarios driving climate models
    and leading to hazard analysis with downscaling for regional specificity and frequency
    exceedance curves for hazard intensity.
Methodology:
  1: Modelling and quantifying the individual components that comprise future risk
    (future natural hazards, future exposure, and evolving vulnerabilities). Focusing
    on preparing for disasters through strategies/policies that aim to minimise uncontrolled
    development in hazardous areas. Examining work that has modeled and quantified
    the individual components that comprise tomorrow's risk.
  3: The paper describes a methodological approach to modeling future climate-related
    hazards involving emission scenarios, climate models, downscaling, event generation,
    and local intensity calculation to generate frequency exceedance curves for hazard
    intensity measures. Uncertainty is incorporated via ensemble modeling.
More Notes:
  1: The paper reviews efforts to provide decision makers with risk-quantification
    approaches to cultivate a sustainable future. The focus is on future risks, moving
    beyond static impacts and historical contexts. The 2015-2030 Sendai Framework
    for Disaster Risk Reduction is highlighted.
  3: The paper focuses on modeling climate-related hazards rather than directly modeling
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes.
