  2: Rising temperatures, changing and more variable precipitation patterns, and rapidly
    rising global water demand.
  3: Changes in precipitation and temperature, affecting river runoff and water availability.
  4: Projected monthly temperature and precipitation from numerous climate models,
    climate change impacts on water resources.

    variability of water flows due to climate change.
  10: Climate change impacts on precipitation patterns and storage yield of basins.
  11: Changes in water availability and demand due to climate change.
  12: Changes in precipitation, which is the primary driver of global patterns of

  14: Changes in precipitation and runoff, specifically trends from 1961-1990 to the
    2050 era, with noise defined by interannual standard deviation of the 2050 era.
  15: Rainfall declines and available energy (driven by temperature) are identified
    as drivers of IWR.

    runoff and, consequently, economic outcomes.
  18: Climate change and rising global water demand are identified as drivers of risk
    to water resource systems.
  19: Precipitation changes, river runoff, irrigation water requirements, and basin
    storage yield.

    basin storage yield.
  4: Water availability and demand, specifically irrigation water requirements, river
    runoff, and basin storage yield.
  5: The study focuses on patterns and sources of uncertainty in a broad set of within-
    and between-model climate ensembles.

    (1961-90) and two future periods (2040-59 and 2080-99).

  22: No relevant information
Highlights:
  2: There is high confidence in the direction of change in water availability in
    some locations, providing clearer signals for longer-term investment decisions
    in water infrastructure.
  3: Projections of water resource variables tend to have higher levels of within-
    and cross-ensemble agreement than precipitation trends due to spatial and temporal
    averaging of precipitation trends and ubiquitous warming. Climate-related changes
    in annual runoff are driven by changes in precipitation rather than evaporation,
    owing to the role of vegetation and soil characteristics.
  6: The first era is a relevant time scale for current water infrastructure planning,
    and the second provides a means to evaluate later signal emergence in many regions
    where emergence does not occur by midcentury.
  7: Maps illustrate predicted changes in annual precipitation over several decades
    under different RCP scenarios.
  8: Climate change will have a more unidirectional (increasing) effect on crop water
    demand than on runoff. Figure 3 shows the percentage change in ensemble-mean annual
    precipitation for various between-model and within-model ensembles.
  9: Basin yield is a key indicator of climate risk to water resources and has economic
    implications for adaptation costs.
  10: Evaluation shows variability in precipitation changes with latitude, using projections
    from different global climate models across CMIP3 and CMIP5 scenarios.
  11: Projected spatial patterns of agreement and disagreement between water availability
    and demand metrics.
  12: Agreement patterns in precipitation trends are spatially consistent over time
    and with emissions scenarios within each ensemble.
  14: A drying signal emerges in some arid regions during the dry season by the 2050
    era. Runoff changes generally exhibit a spatially similar pattern of agreement
    to precipitation trends, but with more robust agreement on drying in certain regions.
    There are differences in the level of agreement between modeled runoff and precipitation
    projections. Certain basins have universal agreement across models, suggesting
    robust trends.
  15: Regional trends are generally positive. The interannual variation of IWR driven
    by both available energy and precipitation causes noise that generally overwhelms
    the signal, with some notable exceptions in the Middle East and western North
    America.
  16: Basins with falling yields will require additional storage or another source
    (e.g., desalinization) to meet demands. Increases in storage yield may present
    opportunities for internal basin development or interbasin transfers.
  17: There is an unexpected degree of agreement in the direction of economic outcomes
    across the World Bank regions. Changes in precipitation have a magnified effect
    on runoff in some basins, leading to greater sign agreement in economic outcomes.
    Even with zero changes in precipitation, costs may still arise due to the temperature
    effect.
  18: Emphasizes unprecedented pressures on already strained water resource systems
    due to climate change and water demand.
  19: There is evident variation in costs between different climate model scenarios.
  20: The northeastern United States shows robust wetting trends and potential benefits
    from adaptation.

Methodology:
  1: Analysis using climate model ensembles
  2: Uses large-ensemble runs of climate projections from groups of climate models
    and repeated runs of individual models to evaluate climate change and effects
    on water resources. Explores spatial and temporal patterns of high confidence
    and uncertainty in projected variables.
  3: The research uses ensembles to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of uncertainty
    in projected river runoff, irrigation water requirements, and basin storage yield.
    It compares within-model results from CCSM, ECHAM, and CMIP5 ensembles, as well
    as between-model results from 23 CMIP5 models.
  4: "Translates climate model outputs into projected effects on water availability\
    \ and demand through a linked series of models. Steps include: characterizing\
    \ baseline conditions, processing climate model ensembles, runoff modeling, modeling\
    \ irrigation water requirements, and basin yield modeling. Uses two river basin\
    \ resolutions: 8951 basins and 126 major river basins. Historical data from 1961-90\
    \ are used from the University of East Anglia\u2019s Climatic Research Unit (CRU)\
    \ Time Series (TS) version 2.1 dataset. A modified Hargreaves formulation is used\
    \ for estimating PET and the Climate and Runoff Model II (CLIRUN-II) for runoff."
  5: The study uses climate model data from CMIP3 and CMIP5 archives, with the majority
    of the analysis conducted on larger within-model and between-model ensembles.
    A 0.583 x 0.58 degree grid is used for mean baseline temperature and precipitation
    data. A modified Hargreaves approach is used to calculate PET.
  6: "The study uses the CLIRUN-II model to simulate changes in runoff, driven by\
    \ projected changes in temperature and precipitation from GCMs. The delta method\
    \ is used to generate changes in each variable, which are then mapped onto a baseline\
    \ climate data set at a 0.583 x 0.583 resolution. The model is calibrated by minimizing\
    \ the squared differences between the 12 monthly GRDC runoff values and the 12\
    \ monthly averaged CLIRUN-II model outputs from the 1971\u201380 simulation period."
  7: Analysis performed using 23-member CMIP5 RCP4.5 and 20-member CMIP5 RCP8.5; results
    applicable from the 2010s through the 2090s relative to a 1961 to 1990 baseline.
  8: "The study uses a simplified method developed by FAO (Allen et al. 1998) and\
    \ employed by IFPRI (Rosegrant et al. 2002) to estimate IWR, relying on globally\
    \ available data like soil characteristics, temperature, precipitation, PET, and\
    \ crop-specific information (planting/harvest dates and water demand timing).\
    \ Crop coverage data at 1/2\xB0 resolution is used, reduced to irrigated areas\
    \ using FAO global gridded irrigation data."
  9: The analysis involves developing storage yield curves to estimate basin yield,
    considering historical intrabasin variability, and assessing climate change impact
    by comparing 1961-90 baseline to 2050 era.
  10: Analysis performed using baseline and projected annual runoff and low-flow values,
    creating storage yield curves for 126 basins across various GCM runs for both
    the 2050 and 2090 eras.
  11: Uses ensemble model agreement to analyze spatial patterns of water availability
    and demand metrics.
  12: The analysis compares agreement patterns in precipitation trends to agreement
    in runoff, IWR, basin yield trends, and economic implications of maintaining historical
    yields.
  14: "The signal is defined as the trend from the 1961\u201390 period to the 2050\
    \ era (2040-2059). The noise is the interannual standard deviation of the 2050\
    \ era. The median SNR over the ensemble is reported."
  15: Analysis uses CMIP3 A1B runs to assess IWR trends. Agreement between models
    is assessed to determine the robustness of the trends.
  16: Economic effects of climate change are estimated by assuming basins with decreasing
    yields incur costs to maintain historical yields and that basins with increasing
    yields gain as economic benefits if water is scarce. Costs are cheaper with either
    increased storage or a backstop of $1 m23 of lost yield, whichever is less expensive.
  17: The analysis aggregates basin-scale costs to seven World Bank regions and compares
    agreement among adaptation cost estimates using between-model and within-model
    ensembles. The study considers the impact of precipitation and runoff changes
    on economic outcomes by fitting lines to percentage changes in these variables
    versus annual costs.
  18: Uses ensemble models to evaluate climate change impacts on water storage yield;
    emphasizes limitations of relying on single models or ensembles.
  19: The analysis uses a range of available within- and between-model ensembles.
    The paper examines spatial and temporal patterns of high confidence and uncertainty
    in climate model outputs.
  20: The analysis uses multiple model ensembles to project changes in water resource
    variables.

  6: The analysis addresses modeling extreme events at the monthly and annual level.
    The choice of CLIRUN-II also introduces uncertainties; prior research suggests
    that there can be large differences between the results of alternative hydrological
    models
  7: Regions are shaded white where fewer than two-thirds of models agree on the direction
    of change. Regions are shaded gray where at least two-thirds of models agree on
    a small change (between -25% and -15%).
  12: The paper finds that agreement patterns in certain regions are maintained even
    when patterns from five within-model ensembles (CMIP5 RCP4.5) are combined.
  14: "Basin locations are provided in Fig. S14 in the supplemental material. Values\
    \ in italics show SNRs of 0.5 to 1 or between -0.5 and -1, and values in boldface\
    \ show greater than 1 or less than -1. The most apparent difference between precipitation\
    \ and runoff change is a general increase in drying in midcontinental regions.\
    \ Drying also moves individual ensembles into the 80% agreement on drying category\
    \ when precipitation is translated to runoff in the Orinoco, Niger, Yellow, and\
    \ Amu Dar\u2019ya Rivers."
  15: The 'double noise' from temperature and precipitation makes it difficult to
    see a clear signal in IWR trends.
  16: "The figure 9 maps show median IWR SNR (integrated water resources signal-to-noise\
    \ ratio) across ensemble members for nine ensembles. The signal is the mean change\
    \ between 1961\u201390 and the 2050 era, and the noise is the interannual standard\
    \ deviation over years in the 2050 era. The maps show geographical distribution\
    \ patterns using color gradients that range from blue to orange, likely showing\
    \ projected changes or variability across different global locations."
  17: The figures show the relationship between basin storage and basin yield under
    different climate scenarios, illustrating how storage requirements may need to
    adapt to maintain current yields under changing climate conditions.

    uncertainty in climate change impacts on water needs and availability.
  19: The analysis explores the spatial and temporal patterns of high confidence as
    well as uncertainty in projected river runoff, irrigation water requirements,
    and basin storage yield.
  22: Boehlert et al. (2015a and 2015b) seem highly relevant as they directly address
    drought impacts and water quality in the US under climate change and mitigation
    scenarios. These should be prioritized for a deeper review.
