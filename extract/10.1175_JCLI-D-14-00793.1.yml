Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change and rapidly rising global water demand placing unprecedented pressures
    on already strained water resource systems; rising temperatures and changing and
    more variable precipitation patterns affecting regional and global water availability
    and demand.
  3: Uncertainty in precipitation and temperature trends due to internal climate variability
    and emissions scenarios affect water resources, which can drive macroeconomic
    risks.
  8: Changing and more variable precipitation; Projected rising temperatures affecting
    crop water demands.
  14: Changes in annual precipitation and runoff trends are the main drivers of risk.
  16: Climate change affecting basin yield, specifically decreasing yields incurring
    costs to maintain historical yields and increasing yields providing economic benefits
    if water is scarce.
  17: Climate models, specifically changes in precipitation and temperature affecting
    runoff, basin storage, and yields; Variability in climate model projections impacting
    adaptation cost estimates.
  19: Temperature changes driven by different climate models (22A1B, 40NCARs, 17ECHAMs,
    20C5R8); Uncertainty in projected river runoff, irrigation water requirements,
    and basin storage yield; Precipitation is the main driver.
  20: Climatic driver of uncertainty in projections of water demand and availability;
    Changes in precipitation and temperature drive modeled changes in river runoff.
  21: Changes in runoff and precipitation in selected river basins under projected
    climate change.
Highlights:
  2: "Agreement across multiple-member climate model ensembles in some locations suggests\
    \ a high degree of con\uFB01dence in direction of change in water availability\
    \ and provides clearer signals for longer-term investment decisions in water infrastructure."
  3: Projections of water resource variables have higher agreement across ensembles
    compared to precipitation trends, important for understanding prudent climate
    adaptation measures.
  8: Climate change will have a more unidirectional (increasing) effect on crop water
    demand than on runoff.
  14: The SNR can provide synthesized information about agreement on trends within
    an ensemble of model runs and can be valuable in deciding on when to implement
    flexible design strategies.
  16: The median annual global net costs of adapting to climate change in the 2050
    era is $15 billion yr21.
  17: Unexpected degree of agreement in the direction of economic outcome across World
    Bank regions; General agreement on benefits in SA and on costs in LAC; Economic
    outcomes map to runoff, which includes the stronger sign agreement in temperature
    trends; Marginal changes in precipitation have a magnified effect on economic
    outcomes in some basins (e.g., Zambezi, Volta, Niger).
  19: Different climate models project varying temperature changes, leading to a range
    of global annualized costs; The box plots visualize the variability and economic
    implications of different climate scenarios; Outliers in the box plots indicate
    scenarios with higher-than-average costs.
  20: Agreement across GCM ensembles, particularly when focusing on agreement within
    broad geographic regions is present, suggesting confidence in direction of change
    in water availability; Adaptation costs vary across within-model ensembles illustrating
    the importance of considering a broad range of climate models.
  21: Reliance on outputs of too few models can generate misleading results in regions
    where consideration of multiple models shows that the direction and magnitude
    of projected changes are highly uncertain.
Methodology:
  2: Analysis uses large-ensemble runs of climate projections, including groups of
    more than 20 different climate models and repeated runs of several individual
    models, to probabilistically evaluate projected climate change and its effects
    on water resources.
  3: The analysis compares large-ensemble runs from different climate models to evaluate
    probabilistic outcomes for climate change and its effects on water resources.
  8: Simplified methods are used to understand irrigation water requirements suitable
    for a global-scale analysis, based on FAO (Allen et al. 1998) and IFPRI (Rosegrant
    et al. 2002) methodologies using data on soil characteristics, temperature, precipitation,
    PET, crop-specific information (planting and harvest dates), and seasonal timing
    of water demands. Focuses on maize and wheat.
  14: The signal is defined as the trend from the 1961-90 period to the 2050 era (2040-2059),
    and the noise is the interannual standard deviation of the 2050 era. The median
    SNR over the ensemble is then calculated for basins.
  16: Economic effects of climate change are estimated by assuming that basins with
    decreasing yields incur costs to maintain historical yields, while basins with
    increasing yields gain economic benefits if water is scarce. Costs are cheaper
    with either increased storage or a backstop of $1 m23 of lost yield, whichever
    is less expensive.
  17: Aggregation of basin-scale adaptation costs to seven World Bank regions; Evaluation
    of agreement among adaptation cost estimates by focusing on geographic regions;
    Analysis of percentage changes in precipitation and runoff versus annual costs
    using multiple climate model runs; Use of storage yield curves to understand the
    impact of climate change on water resources.
  19: Analysis uses a range of available within- and between-model ensembles; Explores
    spatial and temporal patterns of high confidence as well as uncertainty in projected
    river runoff, irrigation water requirements, and basin storage yield.
  20: Analysis uses multiple-member GCM ensembles to project changes in water availability
    and basin-scale supply systems up to 2050 to estimate adaptation costs.
  21: Analysis uses 220 model runs to project changes in runoff and precipitation
    and relates these to adaptation costs; Fourth-order polynomial fits are used to
    model the relationship between runoff/precipitation changes and adaptation costs.
More Notes:
  3: The page emphasizes the role of spatial and temporal averaging in improving the
    agreement of water resource projections.
  8: The study calculates Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) for maize and wheat
    by estimating total monthly crop water demands. The analysis uses a grid of nine
    global maps depicting climate model simulations of annual precipitation change.
  14: The analysis focuses on changes in precipitation and runoff, which are key drivers
    of various downstream economic and fiscal risks (e.g., impacts on agriculture,
    water resources, infrastructure). The supplemental material includes basin locations.
  16: The text discusses the impact of changes in water yield on storage requirements
    and the potential need for additional storage or alternative water sources (e.g.,
    desalination) in basins with falling yields. The analysis includes interquartile
    ranges for CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles, and ranges for intra-GCM ensembles.
  17: The fitted precipitation line being generally above the runoff line indicates
    that zero changes in precipitation will still result in costs as a result of the
    temperature effect.
  19: The analysis considers internal variability and multiple model formalisms; The
    cost estimates are global, not national; The discount rate is 5%.
  20: Basin yield has the advantage of integrating changes in both the mean and variability
    of projected runoff over time. Relative to changes in precipitation, patterns
    of changes in basin yield are both magnified and systematically drier as a result
    of the dependence on land surface dynamics and temperature.
  21: The analysis is indicative, assuming current population, per capita food consumption,
    and per capita water use; Further work is required to consider other projected
    global changes, including rising food demands and population increases.
