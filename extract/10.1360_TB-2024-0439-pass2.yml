Drivers of Risk:
  3: Climate change, specifically heat waves, sea level rise, and droughts, are identified
    as drivers of risk. Human activities leading to greenhouse gas emissions (CO2,
    methane) are also identified as drivers. Extreme weather events threaten low-carbon
    energy generation.
  7: Increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events (heatwaves, floods,
    hurricanes); human-induced climate change; record-breaking heat and drought.
Highlights:
  3: Anthropogenic climate change is a major driver of heat-related mortality and
    labor productivity loss. The impact of climate change varies significantly across
    provinces in China, with southern regions generally experiencing higher risks
    than northern and western regions.
  7: Extreme weather events are significantly impacting human health and economic
    productivity in China; human-caused climate change is a major driver of these
    impacts.
Methodology:
  7: Tracking progress on health and climate change in China through 28 indicators
    across five domains; analysis of impacts of extreme weather events on health outcomes.
More Notes:
  3: The analysis highlights the importance of integrating health considerations into
    climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.
  7: The paper focuses on health impacts, but there are clear implications for labor
    productivity and economic costs associated with extreme weather events. It recommends
    increased investment in renewable energy, harnessing synergies between carbon
    reduction and air quality improvement, establishing meteorology-informed early
    warning systems, promoting research on the compound effects of extreme weather
    events, and developing health adaptation guidelines.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Labor productivity loss due to heat waves is mentioned.
  7: Heatwave-related mortality increased by 342%; heat-related work loss increased
    by 24%; safe outdoor physical activity loss increased by 67%; resulting hours
    available for safe outdoor activities decreased by 9.6%.
Quantitative material:
  3: 49.4% of heatwave-related mortality, 30.9% of heatwave-related labor productivity
    loss, and 98.8% of drought-affected population are attributed to anthropogenic
    climate change. In 2022, comfort days in 58% of 196 cities were below baseline.
    Lingzhi and Kunming had increases in comfort days of 15 and 35 days, respectively.
    At high emissions, the population affected by sea level rise in coastal provinces
    is projected to rise from 7.7% in 2050 to 12.9% in 2100. Urban green spaces are
    estimated to have prevented 38,000 premature deaths over the past 20 years. Coal
    consumption growth reached 4.3%, the second highest since 2011. In 2021-2022,
    there was an increase in the concern and reporting of climate and health issues,
    with growth rates of 1 to 6 times. Energy structure shifts combined with stricter
    pollution control have avoided 72,000, 37,000, and 24,000 premature deaths in
    households, the electricity sector, and industry, respectively.
  7: 49.4% of heatwave-related mortality, 30.9% of heat-related labour productivity
    loss, 98.8% of population affected by drought, and 7.6% of population affected
    by flood in the previous 20 years are attributable to human-caused climate change.
