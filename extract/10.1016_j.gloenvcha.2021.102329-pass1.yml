Drivers of Risk:
  1: Higher levels of income inequality are drivers that increase the vulnerability
    to and damage from climate change-induced natural disasters.
  2: The drivers of risk discussed include flooding, landslides, windstorms, natural
    disasters (generally), specific extreme events like tsunamis, hurricanes, droughts,
    and geophysical events.
  4: The paper considers floods, storms, landslides, droughts, wildfires, and extreme
    temperatures as drivers of risk.
  5: Shocks impacting outcomes include ethnic inequality, geographical location, and
    frequency and cumulative effects of natural disasters.
  6: The drivers of risk include the frequency of disasters (No. disasters, No. dry
    disasters, No. wet disasters), and stocks of disasters (Stock disasters, Stock
    dry disasters, Stock wet disasters). Also El Nino and La Nina dummy variables.
  7: "The number of people hit by natural disasters is influenced by the Gini index,\
    \ GDP per capita, public expenditure, number of disasters, land area, rural population,\
    \ and climate factors (El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a - though these are used as controls\
    \ and coefficients are not reported). The paper also separates dry and wet disasters."
  8: The paper examines the impact of inequality (Gini index), GDP per capita, Human
    Development Index (HDI), public expenditure, institutional quality, and ethnic
    marginalization on the number of people affected by natural disasters.
  9: "The table includes El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a as climatic controls and also includes\
    \ number of disasters."
Evaluation overview:
  1: The paper evaluates the impacts of climate change-induced natural disasters on
    inequality and the reciprocal effect of inequality on susceptibility to disasters.
  2: The page provides an overview of economic and social outcomes, including GDP
    growth, income inequality, poverty, unemployment, asset loss, and mortality, in
    the context of natural disasters.
  4: The paper evaluates the impact of natural disasters, focusing on the number of
    people affected.
  6: The study evaluates the impact of natural disasters (death toll and number of
    people affected) normalized by the previous year's population, using variables
    HIT, D_HIT, and W_HIT.
  7: The paper evaluates the impact of natural disasters (measured by the number of
    people hit) on income inequality (Gini index) and vice versa.
  8: This paper evaluates the number of people affected by natural disasters.
  9: The table analyzes the number of persons hit (normalized) by different types
    of disasters.
  10: The paper evaluates the impact of different types of disasters on income inequality
    (Gini index).
Highlights:
  1: Findings suggest that higher income inequality leads to greater damage when a
    natural disaster occurs, and increased disaster impact further widens inequality,
    creating a disaster-inequality trap.
  2: The impact of natural disasters is uneven across segments of the population within
    a country. Countries at high latitudes have been found to benefit from global
    warming at the expense of countries in lower latitudes. The relationship between
    economic development and disaster risk has an inverted U shape. Income inequality
    exacerbates the impacts of catastrophic events. Lack of access to mitigation and
    prevention measures is similar to 'entitlement relations' with famines.
  4: Floods are the most frequent and impactful disaster type, affecting the highest
    number of people. Asia experiences the highest occurrence of natural disasters.
  7: The Gini index positively and significantly influences the number of people hit
    by disasters, and vice versa. The coefficients are fairly robust across different
    model specifications.
  8: The share of public consumption expenditure on GDP is positively associated with
    a higher number of persons affected by damages, whereas investment expenditures
    in nonfinancial assets are significantly and negatively related to the magnitude
    of impacts.
  9: "La Ni\xF1a has a positive effect on the number of people hit by wet disasters.\
    \ Countries with higher shares of rural population are more exposed to high impacts\
    \ on human activities."
  10: Wet disasters have a greater impact on income inequality than dry disasters.
    The effect of past shocks is statistically significant only for wet events. The
    cumulative impact of repeated wet disasters is more pronounced in countries with
    higher income inequality.
Methodology:
  1: A simultaneous equations approach is used on a panel of 149 countries from 1992
    to 2018 to analyze the bidirectional relationship between natural disasters and
    inequality.
  2: The analysis includes case studies based on quasi-experimental methods (comparing
    growth and inequality before and after events) and longitudinal studies on the
    effect of multiple disasters. It examines both short-term and long-term socioeconomic
    impacts.
  4: The analysis uses regression models, including socioeconomic variables, frequency
    of climate-related disasters, geographical features, and country-based controls.
    Explanatory variables are classified into four groups to explain disaster magnitude
    and inequality.
  5: Analysis is performed using a system of simultaneous equations modeled through
    a Three-Stage Least Square (3SLS) estimator.
  6: The study uses econometric methods and panel data (4,023 observations for most
    variables) to analyze the relationship between disaster impacts, socioeconomic
    resilience, and inequality, applicable to a cross-section of countries over time.
    The study uses exogenous instruments to deal with endogeneity concerns.
  7: The analysis uses a system of equations (specifically, a two-stage least squares
    approach with instrumental variables). The time period is not specified on this
    page. Country fixed effects and continent dummies are included to control for
    unobserved heterogeneity. Multicollinearity is tested using Variance Inflation
    Factors (VIF).
  8: The study uses panel data and regression analysis to assess the relationship
    between various socioeconomic factors and the number of people affected by natural
    disasters.
  9: The analysis uses regression models (equations 2) to examine the climatic and
    geographical controls for different types of disasters. The models control for
    continent and sometimes year.
  10: The analysis uses regression models (equations 3) to assess the relationship
    between disaster types, various socio-economic factors, and the Gini index. The
    study controls for GDP per capita, Human Development Index (HDI), public expenditure,
    institutional quality, and ethnic marginalization. Some models include lagged
    variables and interaction terms to account for dynamic effects and non-linearities.
    The data includes 3419 observations.
More Notes:
  4: The study incorporates gender disparity as a vulnerability factor and considers
    the 'adaptation deficit' by disentangling demand and supply effects related to
    climate security.
  6: The authors address endogeneity by using the distance from the Equator and the
    share of value added in agriculture as instruments. They also employ country fixed
    effects as instruments.
  7: The paper uses lagged values of some socioeconomic variables. The analysis distinguishes
    between different types of Human Development Indices (NHDI, GNHDI, GHDI) and their
    squared terms.
  10: The paper uses the number of people hit by disasters as a measure of exposure.
    The study explores the impact of past disasters and resilience (measured by GDP)
    on vulnerability. The paper also considers the role of ethnic marginalization
    in the impact of disasters on income distribution.
Quantitative material:
  4: The figures present quantitative data on the number of natural disasters by typology
    and continent (1992-2018), the number of persons hit by disaster typology (1992-2018),
    and the number of natural disasters by continent (1992-2018).
  6: The table provides descriptive statistics (Mean, Std. Dev., Min, Max) for various
    variables, including disaster impacts, socioeconomic resilience indicators (GDP
    per capita, HDI, etc.), disaster frequencies, and geographical controls.
  7: The table provides coefficients and significance levels for various factors influencing
    the number of people affected by disasters. For example, a coefficient of 0.004***
    is reported for Gini Index i,t in the disaster equation, indicating a statistically
    significant positive relationship. Also provides RMSE and Mean VIF.
  8: The coefficient of HIT (impact) ranges between 68.5 and 95.3 depending on the
    model.
  9: The table presents coefficients, standard errors, and significance levels (p-values)
    for various factors affecting the number of persons hit by disasters.
  10: The table provides regression coefficients and standard errors for various factors
    influencing the Gini index (income inequality). The paper also reports RMSE, AIC,
    and BIC.
