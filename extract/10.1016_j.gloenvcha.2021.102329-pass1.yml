Drivers of Risk:
  6: The drivers of risk are natural disasters, specifically the number and type (dry
    vs. wet) of disasters, and stocks of accumulated disasters.
  7: "Natural disasters (number and stock of disasters), climate (El Ni\xF1o and La\
    \ Ni\xF1a), socioeconomic factors (GDP per capita, HDI), public expenditure, rural\
    \ population, land area, quality of institutions and marginalisation degree of\
    \ ethnic groups"
  8: Number of people affected by natural disasters (HIT), GDP per capita, Human Development
    Index (HDI and NHDI), Public expenditure, Institutional quality, Ethnic marginalization.
  9: "Gini coefficient (inequality), GDP per capita, Gross National Happiness and\
    \ Development Index (GNHDI), public expenditure, public investment, number of\
    \ disasters, stock of disasters, land area, rural population, El Ni\xF1o, La Ni\xF1\
    a"
  10: Wet disasters, such as floods and storms, and income inequality are key drivers
    affecting economic resilience.
  11: Climate change-induced disasters (specifically wet disasters), inequality, frequency
    of extreme climatic events.
Highlights:
  7: Gini index has a positive and highly significant coefficient in the disaster
    equation (2) across all specifications. Public Expenditure and number of disasters
    is consistently significant across all specifications in table 2a.
  8: An increase in the number of people affected by disasters (HIT) entails a substantial
    rise in inequality. Public expenditure (Public exp) is positively associated with
    a higher number of persons affected by damages. Investment expenditures in nonfinancial
    assets (Public inv) is significantly and negatively related to the magnitude of
    impacts.
  9: "Countries with higher shares of rural population are more exposed to high impacts\
    \ on human activities. La Ni\xF1a has a positive effect on the number of people\
    \ hit by wet disasters. The coefficients and significance levels of various economic\
    \ and geographic factors are reported for different types of disasters."
  10: Countries experiencing frequent and intense wet disasters face higher income
    inequality, which contributes to the vulnerability-disaster trap.
  11: Countries with higher levels of inequality are more vulnerable to being trapped
    in a vicious cycle where frequent extreme climatic events undermine their ability
    to recover and prepare.
Methodology:
  6: The paper uses panel data analysis with fixed effects and instrumental variables
    to address endogeneity concerns. They employ distance from the equator and value
    added in agriculture as instruments. Sargan tests are used to test the validity
    of the instruments. Models are estimated to test hypotheses related to the covariates
    and natural disasters.
  7: The study uses a system of equations (equations 2 and 3) with panel data analysis,
    including country and year fixed effects. It employs instrumental variables (distance
    from the Equator) and controls for multicollinearity using Variance Inflation
    Factor (VIF). General estimation fit is controlled with the Akaike Information
    Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) statistics.
  8: Panel data regression analysis examining the relationship between inequality
    (Gini index) and various macroeconomic and social indicators. The analysis uses
    data from multiple countries over time.
  9: Regression analysis is used to model the impact of climatic and geographical
    controls on the number of persons hit by disasters. The analysis includes continent
    and year dummies. Models consider both the number of disasters and the stock of
    disasters. Dynamic effects are explored by lagging variables, particularly for
    wet events.
  10: The analysis uses a multivariate statistical model, analyzing income inequality
    with geographic and climatic disaster controls; results are based on past data
    considering controls for various disaster typologies.
  11: Empirical analysis of natural disasters between 1992 and 2018, exploring the
    relationship between climate events, inequality, and resulting impacts. Analysis
    uses econometric methods to generate the predicted margins, as illustrated in
    Fig 5.
More Notes:
  6: The paper addresses endogeneity concerns related to the relationship between
    disaster impacts, GDP per capita, public expenditure, and inequality. It also
    considers the role of geographical factors (distance from the equator) and economic
    structure (value added in agriculture) as exogenous instruments.
  7: The study differentiates between dry and wet disasters. The analysis aims to
    identify drivers of the magnitude of disasters and inequality.
  8: The paper hypothesizes and tests the relationship between inequality, natural
    disasters, and various socio-economic factors.
  9: The dependent variable is 'Number of persons hit normalised'. The paper uses
    data to estimate the impacts of various factors, including inequality (Gini),
    economic development (GDP per capita, GNHDI), and policy choices (public expenditure,
    public investment) on disaster impacts.
  10: Richer economies show greater resilience to disasters compared to poorer countries,
    indicating that disaster impact is inversely correlated with a country's wealth.
  11: The study emphasizes the interaction between climatological, environmental,
    and socioeconomic factors in determining the impact of disasters. Adaptation mechanisms
    should consider natural disasters as natural events rather than disasters, implying
    a need for equitable access to precautionary and recovery measures.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  6: This paper analyzes the impact of natural disasters (proxied by HIT, D_HIT, and
    W_HIT variables representing death toll and affected populations) on socioeconomic
    outcomes, including Gini index (inequality) and proxies for economic development.
  7: The research analyzes the impact of natural disasters (measured by the number
    of people affected) and inequality (Gini index).

  10: Income inequality increases with the frequency and magnitude of wet disasters,
    affecting economic resilience.

    Vulnerability of exposed populations.
