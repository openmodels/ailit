Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (CO2 and methane emissions).
  2: Climate change comprises variations in rainfall, drought, flooding, and warmer
    and cooler temperatures affecting food systems.
  3: Climate change (temperature increases, bad climate conditions), inadequate policies,
    insufficient capital, high initial investment costs, labor requirements, management
    intensity, gender gaps, ecological and environmental factors, shortage of cropland,
    land tenure issues, lack of adequate knowledge about climate-smart agriculture,
    slow return on investment, insufficient policy and implementation schemes, unclear
    duties, insufficient links between administration levels, limited resources, political
    intervention, government governance problems, lack of consideration for policy
    initiative effects.
  4: Climate change impacts on crop yields, technical efficiency, and agricultural
    factor productivity.
  5: Climate change; Random shocks (unfavorable weather, measurement errors, variable
    omissions)
  6: Climate change (specifically CO2 emissions and methane emissions)
  8: Insufficient investment in farm-level research, harsh geographical conditions,
    disputes, failure to absorb production and marketing risks, ineffective incentives,
    and climate change (CO2, N2O, CH4 emissions).
  9: Climate change (inferred from CO2 emissions), inefficient use of inputs (labor,
    capital, technology)
  11: Climate change (proxied by agricultural methane and CO2 emissions); Temperature
    increases.
  12: Agricultural methane and CO2 emissions negatively impact land, labor, and fertilizer
    productivity due to increased flooding, soil erosion, acid rain, and drought.
  13: Climate change; Flooding; Corrosive rain; Severe weather
  14: Climate change (acidic rainfall, flooding, land erosion), arable land size,
    and fertilizer consumption.
  15: CO2 and agricultural methane emissions reduce labour, land, and fertilizer productivity.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change diminishes land, labour, and fertilizers productivity at a 1%
    significance level, whereas GDP per capita boosts significantly the total factor
    productivity in agriculture.
  2: By 2050, ensuring food security for nine billion people will require organized
    and extensive adaptation activities.
  3: Climate change negatively affects agricultural productivity and technical efficiency,
    but adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices, technology, and improved
    farming practices can enhance yields and economic gains; Organic fertilizers increase
    yields and economic gain.
  4: The study aims to investigate the impacts of climate change on agricultural factor
    productivity, examine the impact of factor productivity on cereal crop yields,
    and estimate the level of technical efficiency of cereal yields in Sub-Saharan
    African countries.
  5: Stochastic frontier technique is best suited for efficiency studies likely to
    be influenced by situations beyond the control of the decision-making unit; DEA
    fails to assess the potential influence of random shocks, such as measurement
    inaccuracy and other noise in the data.
  6: The study examines the impacts of climate change on agriculture factor productivity
    and uses the pooled OLS panel model due to the absence of individual heterogeneity.
  8: Cereal crop yields and productivity remained steady between 2005 and 2020. Some
    Sub-Saharan African countries, including South Africa and Angola, have high carbon
    emissions and low cereal crop yields.
  9: Africa is predicted to miss out on around 62% of its agricultural potential due
    to technological inefficiency. Crop productivity dropped between 2008 and 2019.
  11: Agricultural methane and CO2 emissions have a harmful and noteworthy impact
    on agricultural factor productivity in sub-Saharan African nations; Climate models
    forecast a progressive rise in carbon dioxide concentration and temperature, adversely
    affecting agricultural factor productivity; 1C temperature increase reduces TFP
    growth rates by 1.1-1.8 percentage points in poorer nations.
  12: Climate change adversely affects land, labor, and fertilizer productivity; GDP
    per capita enhances land productivity through innovation and technological advances.
  13: Land fragmentation and small farm sizes are expected to be significant impediments
    for agricultural sector expansion.
  14: Climate change adversely affected land, labor, and fertilizer productivity in
    Sub-Saharan Africa. Increased land size decreases cereal crop efficiency. Skilled
    labor and fertilizer consumption increase crop production efficiency.
  15: The study concluded that CO2 and agricultural methane emissions reduce labour,
    land, and fertilizer productivity, but GDP per capita income increases factor
    productivity.
Methodology:
  1: Panel data from 35 sub-Saharan African countries between 2005 and 2020, pooled
    OLS and stochastic frontier models.
  3: Examines climate change effects on agricultural yields and the factors influencing
    the adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices. Uses literature analysis
    and empirical observations related to farming practices and climate change impacts
    in African countries.
  4: Panel data estimation technique and stochastic frontier analysis are employed,
    focused on cereal crops (wheat, rice, maize, barley, oats, rye, millet, sorghum,
    and buckwheat).
  5: Stochastic frontier model to assess technical efficiency of cereal crop yields;
    Pooled OLS panel data model to investigate impact of climate change on labour,
    arable land, and fertilizer productivity; Stochastic frontier analysis is more
    applicable to analyzing the technical efficiency of agricultural production.
  6: Pooled OLS panel model; Cobb-Douglas production function

    statistics and correlation coefficients. Analysis period: 1960-1991, 2005-2020.'
  11: Panel unit root test (Fisher-type) for unbalanced and fixed panel data to avoid
    spurious regression; Diagnostic tests for heteroscedasticity and serial autocorrelation
    using Breusch and Pagan Lagrangian multiplier tests and the Wooldridge autocorrelation
    test; Correlation matrix analysis.
  12: The analysis uses regression models to assess the impact of climate change on
    agricultural productivity, focusing on methane and CO2 emissions, with results
    validated using diagnostic tests confirming no serial correlation or non-constant
    variance.
  13: Stochastic frontier model; Stochastic frontier analysis
  14: Pooled OLS and stochastic frontier models were used with panel data sets ranging
    from 2005 to 2020 for Sub-Saharan African countries.
  15: Estimating the technical efficiency of cereal crop yields.
More Notes:
  1: Labour contributed 51.5% and fertilizer contributed 5.7% to raising the technical
    efficiency of cereal crop yields, whereas arable land per hectare reduced the
    technical efficiency of cereal yields by 44.7%.
  2: Climate-smart agriculture adoption has increased productivity, ensured environmental
    quality, and enhanced household food security.
  3: The paper focuses heavily on agriculture in African countries and highlights
    the challenges smallholders and governments face in implementing climate-smart
    agriculture practices.
  4: The study uses panel data from the World Bank database.
  5: Technical efficiency score (TE) ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 represents technical
    efficiency and 0 represents technical inefficiency.
  6: The paper uses technical inefficiency/efficiency scores and economic factors
    to model outcomes.
  8: The study emphasizes the importance of technical innovation and smart agricultural
    technology to boost productivity and ensure food security.
  9: South Africa's carbon emissions are disproportionately high in relation to its
    cereal crop yields. Worker productivity in Sub-Saharan African agriculture declined
    by an average of one percent per year from 1960-1991. The results in Fig 4 demonstrate
    the region is highly technologically efficient, with average technical efficiency
    scores of 0.683 and 0.994.
  11: Adaptations can alleviate climate change by making flexible adjustments in labour,
    fertilizer, and machinery returns in the long run; Agricultural output growth
    enhances the quality of the climate by degenerating greenhouse emissions and mitigating
    climate change crises.
  13: "The quality of labor employed in the agriculture industry is low, with family\
    \ labor having almost zero marginal productivity, and the impact of climate change\
    \ has exacerbated labor productivity in sub-Saharan African countries\u2019 agriculture\
    \ sectors."
  14: Rising GDP per capita income has boosted agricultural input productivity. Fertilizer's
    short-term positive impact contrasts with long-term negative effects on environmental
    sustainability and crop productivity unless combined with organic manure.
  15: The study suggests increasing labour skills, adopting sophisticated agriculture-based
    technologies, and adopting climate resistance technologies to increase cereal
    crop yield efficiency and limit the negative effects of climate change on agricultural
    input productivity.

    a stochastic frontier model of cereal yield per hectare is presented with coefficients,
    standard errors, and t-values for arable land, labor in agriculture, fertilizer
    consumption, and a constant.
  14: Increasing land size by one hectare reduces cereal crop efficiency by 0.447%.
    A 1% increase in agricultural labor contributes to a 0.515% rise in cereal crop
    production efficiency. A 1% increase in fertilizer consumption contributes to
    a 0.057% rise in cereal crop production efficiency. The average technical efficacy
    is 83%, with a maximum of 99.4% and a minimum of 68.3%.
