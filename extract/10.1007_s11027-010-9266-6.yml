Adaptation:
  3: Adaptation primarily refers to adjustments of economic behavior by households
    and communities in response to market signals resulting from climate change impacts,
    without public-policy interventions (autonomous or spontaneous adaptation).
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on forests (specifically based on the IPCC A2-scenario),
    variations in biomass growth across zones.
  3: Changes in factor prices due to climate change impact factor demand, locally
    as well as globally.
  6: Population growth, changes in natural resource availability, and technological
    change. The model also considers constraints on the flow of labour and capital
    across zones in India, which is used to reflect barriers to adaptation to climate
    change. Depletion of oil reserves is also a consideration.
  10: Climate change affecting Indian forests, both in India alone (CCI scenario)
    and globally (CCG scenario). Key climate variables are temperature and precipitation
    changes in different zones.
  11: Climate change impacts on forest biomass growth (increase in some zones, decrease
    in others); Changes in timber prices.
  12: Climate change impacts on forests.
  13: Changes in biomass growth in different zones due to climate change, impacting
    forestry production and factor prices (labor, capital, timber rent).
  14: Reduction in forest harvest due to climate change, leading to changes in biomass
    growth in different zones. Predicted climatic change for India.
  15: Impacts of climate change on forests, specifically changes in biomass growth.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change impacts on forests and adaptation have varying impacts across
    different zones of India. Increased biomass growth does not translate directly
    into increased harvest due to market effects (price and rent reductions).
  10: Forests and forestry differ significantly across the six zones in India. The
    South zone has the highest biomass, while Teak is the dominating harvest except
    in the northern and eastern parts, where Sal dominates.
  11: Climate change has varying regional impacts on forest biomass and productivity,
    leading to adjustments in rotation periods, timber supply, and the shadow price
    of forested land. Biomass increases in most zones but decreases in the Central
    zone. Rotation periods increase in most zones. Rent decreases where biomass increases
    and increases where biomass decreases. Increased biomass may increase the risk
    of deforestation.
  12: Macroeconomic implications of climate change on forests are minor because forestry
    contributes only a minor share of the Indian economy.
  13: A reduction in forest harvest affects labor and capital prices in opposite directions.
    Wages decrease in zones with decreased biomass growth (South and Central), and
    increase in zones with increased biomass growth. Wage increases are higher in
    the mid-century (2045) than at the end of the period (2085).
  14: Climate change impacts on forestry lead to changes in capital prices, wages,
    and trade patterns. India becomes a net exporter of timber under climate change
    scenarios, with stronger effects under the CCI scenario.
  15: Responses to climate change are significant within all components of adaptation
    (rotation period, forest rent, infrastructure investment, technology choices),
    even though forestry contributes a relatively small share of the total Indian
    economy.
Methodology:
  1: Integrated modeling using the dynamic global vegetation model IBIS and the computable
    general equilibrium model GRACE-IN to estimate macroeconomic implications.
  2: The study uses the ecological model IBIS to estimate the impacts of climate change
    in six Indian sub-regions and integrates these results into a global computable
    general equilibrium model focusing on India (GRACE-IN) with an enhanced forestry
    module.
  3: The economic impact of considering only the timber value of forests by supplementing
    information on forest management is considered as a first attempt to link the
    ecological model (IBIS) to the economic model (GRACE-IN).
  6: The paper uses a global bank that allocates savings to regions based on returns
    to capital, with adjustments for transformation elasticities. Economic growth
    is driven by savings ratios, population growth, changes in natural resource availability,
    and technological change. The model assumes full utilization of available resources
    within each region but allows for free flow of labor and capital within sub-regions,
    with constraints on labor and capital flow across zones in India.
  10: The IBIS model is used to calculate biomass, which is then converted to sawtimber.
    A Lotka-Volterra function is calibrated based on the sawlog recovery factor for
    each zone to estimate optimal rotation time. The model is run from 2004 to 2085
    under a reference scenario, a climate change scenario affecting Indian forests
    only (CCI), and a global climate change scenario (CCG). Reference scenario uses
    IPCC A2_ASF scenario.
  11: Uses a model (IBIS) and scenarios to estimate the direct impacts of climate
    change on forests in 2085, assuming the forested area is unaltered. The analysis
    considers the rotation period of biomass growth, supply of timber, and rent of
    biomass under climate change.
  12: Study considers impacts of climate change on forests only and assesses the macroeconomic
    implications using the CCI and CCG scenarios.
  14: The study uses a multi-zone model to analyze the impacts of climate change on
    forestry and related sectors, including trade.
  15: The study uses the ecological model IBIS integrated with the computable general
    equilibrium model GRACE to analyze climate change impacts in India; GRACE includes
    a separate module for forestry.
More Notes:
  1: The model assumes a 'less perfect world' where market effects may increase the
    risk of deforestation due to higher biomass growth. Forestry dependent communities
    may experience local unemployment as a result of declining biomass growth.
  10: The analysis focuses on the forest sector and its economic contribution. The
    paper includes information on forest characteristics, biomass, net primary productivity,
    infrastructure, and harvest levels in different zones of India.
  12: Adaptation is substantial, as harvest changes less than the change in net primary
    productivity. Effect of higher demand dominates the effect of the need to utilize
    less forest when biomass growth increases in three of the four zones with positive
    biological effect of climate change. The higher growth of biomass because of climate
    change leads to a higher pressure on forested land. Minor differences between
    CCI and CCG scenarios for macroeconomic results.
  13: The paper mentions that factor prices respond differently in different zones
    due to constraints on mobility of primary input factors. The burden of changes
    in wage levels is carried by communities where forestry is a major activity, and
    constrained mobility within zones can lead to local unemployment if wages are
    'sticky'.
  14: The ability to move activities around zones can provide some advantages. The
    lumber industry, which uses timber, can be relocated to less costly zones, leading
    to changes in its output that are higher than the average change in the region.
    The impacts on trade are much stronger in the CCI-scenario than in the CCG scenario.
  15: Higher biomass growth may actually increase the risk of deforestation in some
    zones.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Macroeconomic implications for six zones of India, changes in rent on forested
    land, changes in labor and capital input in the forestry sector, local unemployment.

    prices.
  10: GDP impact of climate change on forests and forestry at a zone-by-zone and national
    level in India

    Effectiveness of harvest (infrastructure investment).
  12: The contribution to India's GDP from forestry increases by only 1% due to climate
    change impacts on forests.
  13: Changes in wages and prices of capital in different zones due to climate change
    impacts on the forestry sector.
  14: GDP effects, changes in price of capital, wages, and sectoral output (specifically
    lumber industry)
  15: Macroeconomic impacts for each zone follow the pattern indicated by the direct
    biological impacts of climate change on the forests.
Quantitative material:
  1: Biomass stock increases in all zones but the Central zone. Biomass growth is
    smaller, and declines in one more zone, South zone, despite higher stock. Harvest
    increases by only approximately 1/3 of the change in biomass growth in the four
    zones with increases in biomass growth.
  10: "GDP in Bill US$ for each zone; Biomass in 10^6 tC; Net primary productivity\
    \ in 10^6 tC; Harvest in 10^6 tC; temperature increases between 3.5\xB0C to 4.6\xB0\
    C depending on zone; precipitation increases between 16.5% and 43.1% depending\
    \ on zone."
  11: "In 2085, biomass increases from more than 37% in the North\u2013East zone to\
    \ 9.3% reductions in the Central zone; Net primary productivity declines in the\
    \ South and Central zones, while it increases in the other four zones, and up\
    \ to nearly 80% in the West; Rotation period increases in all zones, except for\
    \ the North, where it declines by 1 year, with the most significant change in\
    \ the West zone where the rotation period increases by 6 years; Rent decreases\
    \ in four zones from 14% (East) to 32% (West) in 2085 and increases in the South\
    \ and Central zones by 7% and 9% respectively."
  12: Contribution to India's GDP from forestry increases by only 1%.
  13: Figure 5 shows changes in wages and price of capital in the CCI scenario by
    zone in 2005, 2045 and 2085; there is also a graph showing change in price.
  14: Exports from forestry increase by 3.3% in 2045 and 5.0% in 2085 in the CCI scenario.
    Exports from forestry increase by 0.9% and 1.7%, respectively, in the CCG scenario.
    The decrease for India in imports in 2045 and 2085 are 1.8% and 2.5%, respectively,
    in the CCI scenario, and 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively, in the CCG scenario.
  15: Changes in rotation period range from a reduction of 1 year and an increase
    of 6 years in the six zones.
