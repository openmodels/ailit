Drivers of Risk:
  2: Anthropogenic emissions, radiative forcing, temperature.
  3: Radiative forcing F resulting from greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone precursors,
    land use change, and other anthropogenic influences
  4: Radiative forcing, temperature anomalies
  5: Temperature-dependent feedback related to warming in tropical convection regions
    and pattern effects is impacting radiative forcing and climate sensitivity.

Highlights:
  2: Structural uncertainty is important for climate projections and dominates uncertainty
    in economic projections of climate change damages, particularly under scenarios
    similar to current emissions reduction targets. A model with a temperature-dependent
    climate feedback is most consistent with global mean surface temperature observations,
    but the sign of the temperature dependence is opposite of what Earth system models
    suggest.
  3: Physical structural uncertainty is substantial in climate economics calculations
    and climate projections and that reported uncertainties may be underestimated.
  4: Compares the impact of parametric uncertainty to structural uncertainty in climate
    projections. Defines and uses a metric u(X) to quantify the importance of structural
    uncertainty.
  5: Structural uncertainty in temperature projections is dominant, especially under
    SSP4-6.0 and SSP3-7.0, impacting economic damage predictions.
  6: Highlights the importance of characterizing structural uncertainty in climate
    and economic projections, and the influence of structural and parametric uncertainty
    on economic damages.
  7: Structural uncertainty plays an important role in reduced complexity climate
    models' total uncertainty, which must be accounted for in their physical projections,
    and especially in the socioeconomic projections that use such simple representations
    of climate physics.
Methodology:
  2: Bayesian approach to quantify structural uncertainty in climate projections using
    energy-balance models. Model selection parameter switches on climate nonlinearities
    and multidecadal climate feedbacks. Shared socioeconomic pathways are used in
    projections.
  3: Quantifies structural uncertainty in a simple Energy Balance Model (EBM) using
    a computational Bayesian approach involving model specification, prior distribution
    specification, sampling, likelihood computation based on observations, and posterior
    distribution construction for probabilistic future projections.
  4: "Uses a climate model with multiple sub-models (linear, T-dependent heat capacity,\
    \ F-dependent heat capacity, T-dependent feedback, F-dependent feedback, slow\
    \ feedback) selected by a parameter \xB5. It draws samples from prior distributions\
    \ and radiative forcing time series, evaluates how well each time series captures\
    \ observed temperatures from 1850-2020, then forces the ensemble with future radiative\
    \ forcing projections. It then translates temperature projections into economic\
    \ damages using a damage function and discount rate."
  5: Analysis used temperature-dependent feedback models with focus on structural
    uncertainty in temperature projections under different SSPs.
  6: Analysis conducted using a temperature-dependent feedback model and multi-model
    ensemble to capture structural and parametric uncertainty, examining discount
    rates and damage functions.
  7: The study considers the role of structural uncertainty in reduced complexity
    climate models, and considers single nonlinear terms at a time.
More Notes:
  3: The paper focuses on how physical uncertainty propagates into uncertainty in
    economic calculations, acknowledging additional uncertainties in economic models.
  4: The model includes different formulations of the climate feedback parameter lambda,
    including constant and time-varying (multidecadal) formulations.

    structural uncertainty dominates non-socioeconomic uncertainty in economic projections
    of climate change damages.
