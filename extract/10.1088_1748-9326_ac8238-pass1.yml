Drivers of Risk:
  2: Uncertainty in climate projections, specifically structural uncertainty related
    to climate nonlinearities and multidecadal climate feedbacks.
  3: Structural uncertainty in climate models.
  4: Radiative forcing under different emissions scenarios impacts future temperature
    projections, which in turn affect economic damages.
  5: Temperature projections under shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP4-6.0 and SSP3-7.0)
    drive economic damage calculations.
  6: Temperature increases projected under SSP4-6.0 and SSP3-7.0, and structural and
    parametric uncertainty in climate models.
  7: "Structural uncertainty plays an important role in reduced complexity climate\
    \ models\u2019 total uncertainty"
Highlights:
  2: Structural uncertainty is crucial for IAMs and climate projections.
  3: Physical structural uncertainty is substantial in climate economics calculations
    and climate projections, and reported uncertainties may be underestimated.
  4: The paper assesses the importance of structural uncertainty in climate models
    by comparing the interquartile range of multi-model projections to that of the
    'preferred' model (the one with the highest posterior mass). A metric u(X) is
    defined to quantify this relative importance of structural uncertainty.
  5: The primacy of structural uncertainty in temperature projections propagates into
    economic damages resulting from climate change.
  6: Structural uncertainty is a significant driver of uncertainty in both physical
    and economic projections of climate change. The choice of damage function and
    discount rate significantly affects the magnitude of projected economic damages.
  7: "structural uncertainty plays an important role in reduced complexity climate\
    \ models\u2019 total uncertainty, which must be accounted for in their physical\
    \ projections, and especially in the socioeconomic projections that use such simple\
    \ representations of climate physics."
Methodology:
  2: Bayesian approach to quantify structural uncertainty in climate projections,
    using idealised energy-balance model representations.
  3: Computational Bayesian approach involving specifying a model, prior distributions,
    drawing samples, computing likelihood based on observations, weighting samples,
    and projecting probabilistically. Applies to simple Energy Balance Models (EBMs)
    used in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs).
  4: A climate model with various formulations (linear, temperature/forcing dependent
    heat capacity, temperature/forcing dependent feedback, slow feedback) is used
    to generate temperature time series. These are then used to generate probabilistic
    projections of future temperatures. Damage functions are used to translate temperature
    projections into economic damages.
  5: Damage calculations use the approach and default assumptions from [10] for SSP4-6.0
    and SSP3-7.0, including the damage function from Weitzman [25] and a discount
    rate of 4.255%.
  6: Energy-balance model used to project temperature changes and economic damages,
    incorporating structural uncertainty through model selection parameters. Damages
    are calculated with a 4.255% discount rate and the Weitzman damage function.
  7: reduced complexity climate models
More Notes:
  2: The model with a temperature-dependent climate feedback is most consistent with
    global mean surface temperature observations, but the sign of the temperature-dependence
    is opposite of what Earth system models suggest.
  3: The paper focuses on how physical uncertainty propagates into uncertainty in
    economic calculations, not on the economic models' uncertainties themselves.
  4: The paper uses Bayesian climate modeling with prior distributions informed by
    physical principles, ESMs, and observational products. Sensitivity to assumptions
    is tested using alternative damage functions and discount rates.
  6: "The study emphasizes the importance of characterizing structural uncertainty\
    \ in climate models for both physical and economic projections. Reductions in\
    \ structural uncertainty may be possible by incorporating known phenomena such\
    \ as the El Ni\xF1o Southern Oscillation or the pattern effect, or leveraging\
    \ other observations such as that of ocean heat content. Paleo records may provide\
    \ a wider dynamic range to constrain structural uncertainty further."
  7: Paleo-observations either need to be used with a substantially inflated uncertainty
    and/or with extreme caution.

Quantitative material:
  2: Structural uncertainty dwarfs parametric uncertainty in temperature projections
    under shared socioeconomic pathways similar to current emissions reduction targets.
  3: Structural uncertainty is much larger than parametric uncertainty for projections
    of T, and consequently for calculations of damages due to climate change.
  4: A discount rate of 4.255% (or a 'patient' discount rate of 2.955%) is used to
    translate temperature projections into economic damages.
  5: Structural uncertainty is dominant for temperature projections under SSP4-6.0,
    with u(T(2100)) = 2.0 and u(T(2300)) = 2.7. For SSP3-7.0, u(T(2100)) = 2.3 and
    u(T(2300)) = 4.1.
