Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in climatic conditions, short-term variation and medium-term changes
    in average regional temperatures and precipitation
  2: Accumulation of greenhouse gases, black carbon deposition, warming atmosphere
    and oceans, rising sea levels, loss of snowpack and ice sheets, moderate changes
    in temperature and precipitation.
  3: Changes in temperature and precipitation (climate change).
  4: Climate change impacts such as growing season changes, pest expansion, heat waves,
    and energy demand shifts.
  5: Increasing average temperatures and precipitation; climate change leading to
    extreme weather events, forest and peat fires, flooding, land erosion, and public
    health challenges; near-surface thawing of the permafrost due to climate warming.
  6: Russia's outdated and energy-inefficient industrial base; Recent economic recession.
  8: Annual temperature realization (X), Precipitation (P), Forest fires (regional
    responses depending on characteristics of regional governors)
  10: Weather shocks considered as random draws from the climate distribution impacting
    regions randomly.
  11: Weather or climate, specifically temperature changes impacting heating costs
    and energy demand.
  12: Potential impacts through agriculture and energy use from heating and cooling
    are considered as drivers of risk.
  15: Annual temperature; precipitation; Underage and Overage populations; Industrial
    growth; Communist Party influence; Population density
  16: Temperature, precipitation, population density ("Pop.OvDensity"), and other
    variables.
  17: Temperature increase in a region and its influence on regional expenditures;
    contrasting significance of temperature vs. precipitation on different expenditure
    types.
  19: Temperature change due to climate change, specifically using A2 and B1 climate
    scenarios.
  20: Changes in temperature and precipitation.
  21: Temperature, precipitation, cooling variables, heating variables, housing.
  22: Mentions cooling and precipitation which can be linked to climatic variables
    (e.g. increases in temperature or changes in rainfall patterns).
Highlights:
  1: Increase in temperature results in a decrease in public expenditures (non-linear
    relation).
  2: The study addresses a research gap in econometric analysis of public adaptation
    costs, focusing on moderate changes in temperature and precipitation on regional
    government expenditure in Russia.
  3: Temperature rise over the short term reduces regional government expenditures
    in cold regions; weather benefits accumulate, leading to a larger medium-term
    effect on decreasing regional government expenditures.
  4: Climate change impacts in Russia include longer growing seasons, pest expansion,
    more heat waves, reduced heating demand, and increased cooling demand.
  5: Russia perceives potential economic benefits from climate change but faces serious
    climate change vulnerabilities, including infrastructure risks from thawing permafrost
    and increased extreme weather events.
  6: Russia's emission reduction goals may be met without actual mitigation efforts
    due to its outdated industrial base.
  7: There is an absence of evidence on the fiscal impact of moderate but persistent
    climate changes, indicating a gap in the literature.
  8: Climate is a fixed regional variable in an econometric sense, making it challenging
    to include regional fixed effects in climate models due to collinearity. Annual
    weather variations can be used to estimate short-term climate impacts.
  9: The FE model provides a 'no-adaptation' benchmark. The LD model aims to capture
    adaptation, omitted variable problems, and medium-term impacts of climate change.
    The Russian mean temperature has steadily increased during the time-series.
  11: Temperature changes impact regional budget expenditures through housing expenditures,
    especially in colder regions with higher public ownership of housing. The study
    tests the fit of weather variables with expenditure and finds that expenditures
    seem to have the most robust fit with the first lag of the temperature variable.
  15: Rising temperatures generally decrease regional expenditures, but the relationship
    is non-linear. Colder regions benefit from warmer weather up to a point, beyond
    which the effect diminishes or reverses. The non-linear analysis suggests the
    impact of warming is smaller than the linear model suggests.
  16: Several coefficients are statistically significant (indicated by *, **, ***).
  17: Temperature has a significant cumulative effect on total expenditures, with
    the longer-run LD model coefficients being notably larger than short-term estimates.
  19: Warming in Russia is predicted to lead to savings in regional government expenditures,
    ranging from USD 2 billion to USD 4 billion in the B1 scenario and USD 2 billion
    to USD 3.5 billion in the A2 scenario (in real terms, non-discounted) between
    2000 and the 2020s.
  20: Warming leads to savings in regional budget expenditures for Russian regional
    governments in the short term.
  21: Temperature and precipitation appear to have a statistically significant impact
    on regional government expenditures in certain models. The coefficients suggest
    both positive and negative relationships, depending on the model and variable.
    Housing also appears to have an impact.
  22: There are no clearly stated important outcomes on this page, but there seems
    to be statistically significant impacts related to housing expenditure and LogFull.
Methodology:
  1: "Econometric analysis using a sub-national dataset for Russia covering 1995\u2013\
    2009 to estimate the impacts of changes in climatic conditions."
  2: Econometric analysis of public adaptation costs of climate change using sub-national
    data for Russia, focusing on the effects of temperature and precipitation on regional
    government expenditure.
  3: Analysis of annual data from 1995 to 2009 across 78 Russian regions to analyze
    changes in regional government expenditure.
  6: No relevant information
  7: Some studies use a combination of qualitative-quantitative analysis to estimate
    climate change impacts on government finances.
  8: "Fixed-effects (FE) model: Yit = \u03B1 + \u03BCi + \u03B8t + f(Xit) + g(Pit)\
    \ + \u2211Kj \u03B3j Zjit + \u03B5it. The model includes regional and time fixed\
    \ effects. Addresses omitted variable bias by using fixed effects model to control\
    \ for regional heterogeneity."
  9: "The authors use both a fixed effects (FE) model and a long-difference (LD) model\
    \ to estimate the impact of climate change. The FE model captures short-term effects\
    \ with limited adaptation. The LD model, based on Dell et al. (2014), estimates\
    \ medium-term impacts by examining changes in climate (averaged annual weather)\
    \ and outcomes over longer periods (e.g., decades). They use a model similar to\
    \ Dell et al. (2014): Yid \u2212 Yi,d \u2212 1 = \u03B2 (C id \u2212 C i,d \u2212\
    \ 1 ) +\u03B3 j (Z jid \u2212 Z ji,d \u2212 1 ) + (\u03B5 id \u2212 \u03B5 i,d\
    \ \u2212 1 )."
  10: Acknowledges issues of spatial autocorrelation which may lead to incorrect standard
    errors.
  11: Panel data analysis using Fixed Effects (FE) and Long Difference (LD) models.
    Uses Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors in the FE model to account for
    spatial and temporal dependence and heteroskedasticity. Heteroskedasticity robust
    standard errors are used in the LD model. Lags of the temperature variable are
    included as independent variables.
  12: The study considers non-linear effects in energy demand due to extreme temperatures.
  14: 5% of temperature and precipitation data removed from tails for robustness.
  15: Fixed effects estimates for linear and quadratic models, with and without trimming
    5% of the tails of temperature and precipitation variables. Analysis applied to
    Russian regional data.
  16: Regression analysis using Driscoll-Kraay standard errors. The models likely
    examine panel data ("Estimations with both"). There are linear and quadratic specifications.
    "LogFullL" suggests a logarithmic transformation of a variable named "FullL".
  17: Comparison of FE and LD models to estimate short-term and long-term effects
    of climate change; LD model used for capturing longer-run effects and adaptation.
  19: "Fixed effects models are used to determine the relationship between temperature\
    \ and expenditure. Regional temperature predictions are multiplied by regional\
    \ temperature gradients to estimate regional impacts, then averaged to obtain\
    \ a national estimate. 2000 government expenditures are inflated to 2013 prices\
    \ to estimate monetary impact. The analysis is limited to the 2020s and only includes\
    \ data where the temperature change is less than 2\u25E6C, and within the variation\
    \ available in their data."
  20: Short-term variation provides a no-adaptation benchmark, while mid-term change
    captures potential adaptation.
  21: The analysis appears to be regression-based, examining the impact of climate-related
    variables on regional government expenditures. The models (a1 to a8) likely represent
    different specifications or datasets. The applicability depends on the regional
    context and data used. The page uses a quadratic term for temperature (temperature^2).
  22: This page describes results from regression analysis with various control variables.
    The specific setup/framework/context is needed from the other pages to determine
    its applicability. Driscoll-Kraay standard errors are mentioned which are used
    in panel data to account for spatial correlation and heteroskedasticity.
More Notes:
  1: Results suggest benefits from warming accumulate and adaptation measures could
    help leverage those benefits; The magnitude of the temperature effect diminishes
    the warmer the region.
  2: The paper acknowledges the bias towards mitigation research and argues that adaptation
    is not solely a private sector issue. It also addresses uncertainties and imperfect
    information that could prevent efficient private-sector adaptation.
  3: The analysis focuses on mild climate change and reactive adaptation; radical
    changes like permafrost melting are not considered.
  4: Russia is experiencing faster temperature increases than the global average,
    particularly in the Arctic regions.
  5: Russia's initial reluctance to commit to climate change mitigation stems from
    the perception of potential benefits and a public opposition to using public funds
    on mitigation.
  6: The text discusses Russia's carbon emission targets, regional public finances,
    and fiscal federalism, but does not directly address the macroeconomic/macro-fiscal
    risks of climate change or adaptation costs/benefits. It highlights the heterogeneity
    of Russian regions and the centralized nature of its fiscal system.
  8: The page discusses the econometric challenges of estimating climate impacts due
    to climate being a fixed regional variable. It introduces a fixed effects model
    to estimate the impact of temperature and precipitation on regional expenditures,
    controlling for other factors. The references to other papers provides some context
    on challenges in estimating the impact of climate change using macroeconometric
    models.
  9: The LD model is considered an improvement over the FE model for capturing adaptation
    and long-term effects, but it has limitations, particularly when periods are too
    far apart. Specific time periods used for analysis include 1995-2001 and 2002-2009
    for Russia, based on data availability. The authors acknowledge that weather averages
    of less than ten years probably cannot credibly depict local climate, which somewhat
    undermines the analysis.
  15: The causality of the Communist variable is unclear. The study notes a strong
    negative correlation (-0.58) between regional income per capita and support of
    the Communist Party. The paper examines the relationship between weather and expenditures.
    The non-linearities are important for understanding regional differences in climate
    impacts.
  16: The page presents highly condensed regression output, making it difficult to
    fully understand the model without context. The outcome variables are not clearly
    specified. There are several variables that are difficult to interpret ("Communist",
    "Industrial", "PublicW", "Observ"). The results appear to be split into multiple
    rows or models. The table includes interaction terms like "T*TPrecipitationPrecipitation".
  19: The study acknowledges that the choice of climate scenarios is somewhat arbitrary
    and is used primarily for illustrative purposes. The benefits are considered small
    compared to Russia's consolidated regional budget expenditures. Roughly half of
    the predicted warming and associated expenditure benefits had already occurred
    by the end of the 2000s.
  20: The study acknowledges that the mid-term results are less robust and do not
    account for large increases in temperature (e.g., permafrost thaw).
  21: The information is presented in a condensed format, making it difficult to fully
    understand the model specifications and data used. It is necessary to look at
    the wider context to understand the variables. The lack of clear labels, combined
    with the data format, indicates a table or figure cut from a larger work.
No relevant information:
  13: This page seems to be a poorly formatted table or data dictionary. It is difficult
    to discern any clear macroeconomic/fiscal outcomes, risk drivers, or methodology
    related to climate change adaptation at the national level. The page seems to
    contain variable names and some statistical descriptions, but without context,
    their relevance to the research question is unclear.
