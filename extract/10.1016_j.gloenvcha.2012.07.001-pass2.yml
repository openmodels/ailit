  3: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global change, interacting physical, biological, socio-economic, and institutional
    factors, cross-boundary and cross-level dynamics.
  2: Dzud (severe winter disaster) including white dzud (deep snow covers grass),
    black dzud (freezing temperatures and lack of snow and forage), and hoofed dzud
    (livestock converge in a location, and trampling and heavy grazing eliminates
    forage).
  4: Severe winter disasters (dzud), temperature increase, precipitation decline,
    streamflow declines, loss of natural springs
  5: "Drought, insuf\uFB01cient water sources, extreme cold, deep snow, lack of rigorous\
    \ preparation for winter, lack of government guidance or encouragement, inadequate\
    \ hay stores, poorly prepared hand fodder, absence of reserved winter or spring\
    \ pastures, a 'hoofed dzud' (high livestock losses in areas where otor herds concentrate\
    \ due to migration), lack of knowledge about how to use supplemental feed, poorly\
    \ prepared winter shelters and bedding grounds, lack of informal mutual assistance,\
    \ ineffective PUGs, incoming otor herders, drying climate, disappearing water\
    \ sources."
  6: The drivers of risk are related to exposure to the dzud disaster, which is itself
    driven by local and regional variations in temperature, snow depth, pre-existing
    forage conditions, and changes in forage availability due to high livestock numbers
    (hoofed dzud). Limited natural assets such as water sources and riparian areas
    that produce harvestable hay also increase vulnerability.
  9: Dzud events, high sensitivity (lack of preparedness), ineffective government
    response, hoofed dzud (increased exposure due to incoming herders), climate exposure,
    lack of coordination between local government and aid organizations.
  12: Severe winter disasters (dzud), specifically climate change affecting snow depth,
    coldness, and drought.
Highlights:
  1: Vulnerability to dzud is a function of interacting physical, biological, socio-economic
    and institutional factors. Communities well prepared at the household level may
    suffer disproportionate losses if exposure is increased by in-migrating livestock.
    Relief aid may contribute to long-term dependence syndromes.
  2: The study aims to learn from the 2009-2010 dzud to identify vulnerabilities,
    inform and improve response measures, and suggest strategies for strengthening
    community resilience to future dzud.
  4: Cross-boundary and cross-level dynamics increase vulnerability to severe winter
    disasters (dzud) in Mongolia.
  5: Institutional arrangements are needed to effectively manage cross-boundary mobility
    of otor herders to reduce vulnerability, even among well-prepared communities
    and households.
  6: The paper highlights that cross-boundary and cross-level dynamics increase vulnerability
    to severe winter disasters (dzud) in Mongolia. Local government leadership, proactive
    planning, and effective coordination and communication during a disaster are important
    for managing risk.
  7: Poor households lost a significantly higher proportion of their livestock during
    the dzud. Fall otor and reserved spring pasture areas helped to reduce livestock
    losses.
  9: Emergency aid was often too small to make an impact or not delivered when needed,
    leading to equity and transparency concerns, lack of coordination, and perverse
    incentives like aid dependency.
  12: Mobility and reciprocity are critical strategies to reduce vulnerability to
    dzud, but can increase exposure and vulnerability of communities hosting incoming
    herds if cross-boundary agreements are not effectively monitored and enforced.
Methodology:
  2: "In-depth case studies of four communities\u2019 responses to the 2009\u2013\
    2010 dzud were conducted to assess herder household and community vulnerability,\
    \ adaptive capacity, and short-term recovery."
  4: Household surveys, photovoice, social capital indices, statistical analysis (SPSS
    17). The study uses stratified random sampling of households in four study sites
    in Mongolia. Data were collected pre- and post-dzud (2009 and 2010).
  5: "Student\u2019s t-tests comparing the percent of herd lost for households that\
    \ did and did not undertake each dzud preparation or response method; multiple\
    \ regression to assess the relationship between percent of herd lost and continuous\
    \ explanatory variables; ANOVA to assess whether percent herd losses varied among\
    \ the 3 wealth groups, treating the soum as a blocking variable. Differences signi\uFB01\
    cant at a p-value of 0.10."
  6: The analysis is a cross-case comparison of vulnerability to dzud in different
    soum (districts) in Mongolia. Data are from household surveys and indicate the
    percent of surveyed households that carried out stated practices.
  7: Study sites were Ikhtamir, Undur Ulaan, Jinst, and Bayantsagaan. Analysis uses
    statistical comparisons (F-tests and t-tests) with wealth group and winter preparation
    methods as variables. The analysis also used interviews and photovoice. Results
    are applicable to the 2009-2010 dzud in Mongolia.
  9: The research is based on household surveys and interviews with soum officials
    in four case study sites in Mongolia.
  12: Case studies examining social and ecological dynamics related to dzud vulnerability
    at household, community, and cross-level scales.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on dzud impacts and responses in Mongolia through case studies.
  2: "The study aims to assess herder household and community vulnerability, adaptive\
    \ capacity, and short-term recovery from the dzud of 2009\u20132010 and identify\
    \ factors associated with household and community vulnerability, adaptive capacity\
    \ and resilience to dzud."
  4: The study sites are characterized by ecological characteristics such as Ecozone,
    Area, Ave. Precipitation, Standing Crop, and Habitat Diversity.
  5: The paper uses case studies of different soums (Ikhtamir, Undur Ulaan, and Jinst)
    in Mongolia to analyze vulnerability to dzud events and the effectiveness of different
    adaptation strategies. Relief aid distribution can create perverse incentives.
    Cooperation can help prevent worse losses during dzud events. Crises can motivate
    informal cooperation and raise awareness and influence herder attitudes about
    future herd management.
  6: The study appears to examine the interplay of natural conditions, local government
    actions, and herder behavior in determining the impact of a dzud. The concept
    of a 'hoofed dzud', resulting from the influx of livestock from other areas, is
    introduced as a factor influencing exposure.
  7: Sensitivity to dzud at the household level was driven by (1) animal condition,
    (2) availability and use of forage and hay reserves, and (3) household herd size.
    Community-level sensitivity was affected by natural features of each soum and
    institutional factors such as the effectiveness of local government.
  12: The paper highlights the importance of cross-level institutions for managing
    pastoral mobility and ensuring equitable access to resources during dzuds. It
    also mentions that otor movements primarily benefit well-off herders.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Increased frequency and intensity of dzud (severe winter weather disaster) placing
    livestock and livelihoods at risk.
  2: "Livestock mortality (8.5 million in 2009-2010 dzud, approximately 20% of the\
    \ country\u2019s livestock population, affecting 769,000 people or 28% of Mongolia\u2019\
    s human population)."
  4: No relevant information
  5: Herd losses as a vulnerability indicator.
  6: Percentage of herd lost (measured in Standardized Animal Units, SFU) due to the
    dzud winter disaster is used as a measure of economic cost.  Specifically, the
    herd loss percentage is provided for each of the soum sites analyzed.
  7: "Loss of livestock impacts household income earning potential and household consumption\
    \ behavior, which, in turn, may affect nutritional status of household members.\
    \ Loss of livestock also affects a household\u2019s ability to complete cultural\
    \ and social obligations."
  9: Impacts of emergency aid and assistance in mitigating the impacts of dzud (severe
    winter disasters) on households.
  12: Potential decline in number of households and livestock which can act as a stabilizing
    feedback at the local level, but outmigration can be a source of cross-level vulnerability
    at the national level. Boom-bust cycle of herd recovery after dzuds, potentially
    leading to ecological degradation.
Quantitative material:
  2: Table 1 provides data on dzud incidence and frequency in Mongolia over the past
    70 years.
  4: Livestock losses (23.7% to 42.9% loss of livestock at the household level), changes
    in standing crop, population sizes, area, average precipitation
  5: Percent of the 2009 herd lost in the dzud calculated in Sheep Forage Units (SFU)
    is used as a vulnerability indicator; one sheep is equal to 1 SFU, a cow 5 SFU,
    camel 6 SFU, horse 7 SFU and goat 0.9 SFU.
  6: The percentage of herd lost (SFU) is quantified for different soum sites (Ikhtamir
    30.7% (3.34), Undur Ulaan 42.9% (6.7), Jinst 13.7% (2.2), Bayantsagaan 38.9% (5.9)).
    There is also data on the tons of hay cut, percentages related to winter preparations,
    and impacts of the dzud (e.g., % of herders perceiving worse pasture and animal
    conditions)
  7: Wealthy households lost 25.5% of their herd, middle households lost 29.7%, and
    poor households lost 39.2%. Households that used fall otor lost 26.1% of their
    herd compared to 35.4% for those that did not. Households that reserved spring
    pasture lost 21.6% of their herd compared to 34.2% for those that did not.
  9: Table 6 summarizes sources and type of emergency aid in each study soum, listing
    organizations and types of aid (fodder, food, medicine, clothing, cash) provided
    in different soums. It also includes a count of aid sources per soum.
