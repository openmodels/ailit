Drivers of Risk:
  3: Increasing frequency of extreme droughts
  5: Changes in drought frequency and intensity due to climate change, measured by
    Plant Accessible Soil Water (PASW).
  6: Increased drought frequency and intensity (particularly extreme droughts), low
    humidity, low precipitation, high temperature, high radiation, increased carbon
    release from fire disturbances
  7: Emission scenarios (RCP8.5 and RCP4.5), extreme droughts, changes in environmental
    drivers (PASW, temperature, humidity, radiation), CO2 fertilization.
  14: Droughts, different climate variables (temperature, humidity, radiation, precipitation,
    PASW (presumably a soil moisture indicator)), and different vegetation states
    (PFT compositions, height, leaf area index).
  19: Droughts.
Highlights:
  3: Extreme droughts are projected to have a dramatically increased impact on GPP,
    tripling GPP reduction by the end of the century.
  5: Extreme droughts are projected to become significantly more frequent under future
    climates. The impact of droughts is assessed by deviations in Gross Primary Productivity
    (GPP).
  6: The increasing impact of drought upon GPP mainly results from the increased frequency
    of drought events, particularly extreme droughts.
  7: Extreme droughts are projected to contribute a larger proportion of total GPP
    reduction in the future. CO2 fertilization is projected to increase GPP significantly.
  14: Drought-associated GPP reduction could plausibly extend past the end of the
    duration of drought defined based on soil moisture.
  19: Droughts are projected to impact GPP, with the magnitude of the reduction varying
    spatially and compared to a historical baseline.
Methodology:
  3: Analysis of outputs of 13 Earth System Models (ESMs) over the 21st century, comparing
    historical (1850-1999) and future (2075-2099) periods
  5: The study classifies droughts into extreme, moderate, and mild based on PASW
    percentiles. Future drought projections use grid-cell-, model-, and month-specific
    historical simulations. GPP deviations from the mean are used to assess drought
    impact. Analysis covers 1850-2099.
  6: Projecting future drought events and their impacts on Gross Primary Productivity
    (GPP) under different RCP scenarios. Results are applicable to 2075-2099 for specific
    RCPs.
  7: Earth system model projections are used to project changes in GPP and the impact
    of droughts under different emission scenarios. Analysis is performed to determine
    the contribution of several environmental drivers to GPP reduction.  The analysis
    considers the impact of CO2 fertilization.
  14: The study fits multilinear regressions to estimated GPP deviations with explanatory
    climate and vegetation variables for drought events during 25-year periods between
    1850-2099. Statistical tests were used to test for significant differences in
    drought risks and associated GPP reductions.
  19: Analyzes GPP anomalies associated with droughts during 2075-2099 relative to
    the historical period of 1850-1999 using an ensemble of 13 Earth system models.
    The P-values were calculated using the bootstrap sampling to test if the mean
    magnitude of GPP reduction during 2075-2099 across different models becomes significantly
    larger than that during the historical period.
More Notes:
  3: Positive anomalies of GPP associated with favorable environmental conditions
    can potentially mitigate the risk of extreme droughts to the global carbon cycle
  5: The paper uses RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Droughts
    can either stimulate or reduce GPP, depending on the location.
  6: The study highlights the spatial distribution of drought risks, with particular
    risk for the Amazon, South Africa, Mediterranean Basin, Australia, and Southwest
    USA. The effect of CO2 fertilization is considered, potentially offsetting some
    GPP reduction.
  7: The paper focuses on the impact of droughts on GPP. The GPP reduction associated
    with droughts can be viewed in the context of rising GPP under future CO2 fertilization.
  14: The paper acknowledges its approach might underestimate drought impacts and
    calls for specific model experiments to identify lag impacts of droughts on GPP.
  19: The GPP anomalies are spatially distributed. The analysis focuses on the period
    2075-2099 compared to a historical baseline of 1850-1999. The study uses 13 selected
    Earth system models.

Quantitative material:
  3: "Magnitude of globally-averaged reductions in GPP associated with extreme droughts\
    \ was projected to be nearly tripled by the last quarter of this century (2075\u2013\
    2099) relative to that of the historical period (1850\u20131999) under both high\
    \ and intermediate greenhouse gas emission scenarios."
  5: Extreme drought frequency projected to increase by a factor of ~3.8 (p-value
    < 0.001) under RCP 8.5 and ~3.1 (p-value < 0.001) under RCP 4.5 during 2075-2099
    compared to 1850-1999. Moderate drought frequency projected to increase by a factor
    of ~1.2 (not significant with p-value > 0.2) under RCP 8.5 and ~1.5 (p-value <
    0.01) under RCP 4.5 during 2075-2099 compared to 1850-1999.
  6: "Global GPP reductions associated with droughts will rise from ~2.8Pg C per year\
    \ during 1850\u20131999 to ~4.5 and ~4.7Pg C per year (p-value <0.01) during 2075\u2013\
    2099 under emission scenarios RCP8.5 and RCP 4.5, respectively."
  7: "Extreme droughts are projected to increase GPP reduction from ~28% during 1850\u2013\
    1999 to ~56% and 49% during 2075\u20132099 under RCP 8.5 and RCP4.5, respectively.\
    \ Globally-averaged mean GPP is projected to be ~50% and ~31% higher for year\
    \ 2075\u20132099 compared to the historical period (1850\u20131999) under emission\
    \ scenarios of RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5, respectively."
  14: "The study uses multilinear regressions to explain GPP deviations using PASW,\
    \ daily temperature, incoming solar radiation, relative humidity, and mean GPP\
    \ for drought events during 25-year periods within 1850\u20132099."
  19: Values < -1 indicate that the magnitude of GPP reduction becomes larger relative
    to the historical period, while values > -1 indicate that the magnitude of GPP
    reduction becomes smaller.
