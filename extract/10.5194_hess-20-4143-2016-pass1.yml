Drivers of Risk:
  1: Population increases, economic growth, climate change, growing water demand
  10: Growth in income is the main driver of increased desalination, with climate
    change (specifically changes in Aridity Index, AI) playing a marginal role.
  11: "GDP per person exceeding a certain threshold (14000 USDPPP person\u22121 yr\u2212\
    1), aridity index, and number of grid cells of seashore."
  12: The main driver of risk considered is water scarcity, influenced by socioeconomic
    pathways (SSPs) that affect water use, GDP per capita, and aridity index (AI).
  13: Projected decrease in water resources due to climate change.
Highlights:
  1: "The usage of seawater desalination will have expanded considerably in geographical\
    \ extent, and that production will have increased by 1.4\u20132.1-fold in 2011\u2013\
    2040 compared to the present (from 2.8\xD7109 m3 yr\u22121 in 2005 to 4.0\u2013\
    6.0\xD7109 m3 yr\u22121), and 6.7\u201317.3-fold in 2041\u20132070 (from 18.7\
    \ to 48.6\xD7109 m3 yr\u22121)."
  10: AUSD cells are expected to expand into most of the arid areas in the world by
    2055 due to income growth.
  11: The economic cost of seawater desalination, while small globally, can be significantly
    higher in regions like MENA, especially under scenarios with large water use and
    low GDP growth (SSP3).
  12: 'Desalination production is projected to increase significantly in the future,
    particularly in regions like the Middle East and North Africa. The level of desalination
    production is sensitive to socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), GDP per capita, and
    aridity index. Desalinated water will play a critical role in arid and semi-arid
    regions even if the total production is still a small share of the global water
    consumption, especially because the population in the arid and semi-arid regions
    is expected to significantly increase by 2055. '
  13: Desalination is high energy and costly; income and aridity thresholds are crucial
    for plant installation.
Methodology:
  1: "Developed a model to estimate areas and volume of seawater desalination, designed\
    \ to be incorporated into global hydrological models (GHMs), applied to a historical\
    \ year (2005) and two future periods (2011\u20132040 and 2041\u20132070) under\
    \ three distinct socioeconomic conditions (SSP1, SSP2, and SSP3)."
  10: The study uses a Seawater Desalination Model (SDM) to project the spread of
    areas utilizing seawater desalination (AUSD) under different Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSPs).
  11: "Adopting the method of Lamei et al. (2008), we estimated the unit production\
    \ costs at 0.40\u20133.78 USD m\u22123 based on the data available for 186 plants\
    \ globally."
  12: The analysis uses global hydrological models and socioeconomic pathways (SSPs)
    to project future water demand and desalination production. It examines the sensitivity
    of desalination production to GDP per capita and aridity index thresholds. The
    results are applicable to projecting desalination needs until 2055 under different
    global development scenarios.
  13: SDM model estimates desalination needs based on assumptions and conditions on
    income and aridity.
More Notes:
  10: The model excluded non-hyper-arid regions in its initial version (SDM), leading
    to inconsistencies with the actual distribution of desalination plants in 2014.
    An updated version (SDM2) addressed this limitation.
  11: The future projection is sensitive to the assumed thresholds for GDP per person,
    aridity, and seashore grid cells, and these thresholds were tested in the study
  12: The paper focuses on the supply-side adaptation strategy of desalination. The
    use of SSPs allows for exploring the impact of different socioeconomic futures,
    making the analysis relevant for long-term planning. The sensitivity analysis
    provides insights into the factors influencing desalination production.
  13: Uncertainties stem from regional differences and model limitations regarding
    technology advancements and cost impacts.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: GDP effects, costs of adaptation
  10: No relevant information
  11: Impacts on GDP due to the economic cost of seawater desalination. Cost is measured
    as percentage of total global GDP.
  12: The paper provides estimates of desalinated water production, which can be seen
    as a measure of adaptation to water scarcity. It mentions implications in the
    context of global water resource assessment, but does not discuss specific macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes.
  13: Desalination affordability is influenced by energy prices and economic thresholds.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Estimated global costs for desalination production are USD1.1\u201310.6\xD7\
    109 (0.002\u20130.019% of the total global GDP) for 2011-2040, USD1.6\u201322.8\xD7\
    109 (0.001\u20130.020%) for one scenario of 2041-2070, and USD7.5\u2013183.9\xD7\
    109 (0.002\u20130.100%) for other scenarios of 2041-2070."
  10: "Using SDM, the projected levels of desalinated water production in 2025 and\
    \ 2055 are 1.4\u20132.1 and 6.7\u201317.3 times greater than present, respectively."
  11: "Seawater desalination cost is estimated at 0.002\u20130.019% of total global\
    \ GDP in 2005. In MENA, this value is 0.032\u20130.306%. SSP3 in 2055 showed the\
    \ highest numbers at 0.011\u20130.100% globally and 0.121\u20131.147% for MENA."
  12: The paper provides quantitative estimates of desalinated water production by
    region for the years 2005, 2025, and 2055 under different SSP scenarios (SSP1,
    SSP2, SSP3). It also quantifies the impact of GDP per capita and aridity index
    thresholds on global desalination production in 2005 and 2055.
