Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, population growth, and upstream land use changes increasing the
    risk of water shortage due to droughts.
  2: Drought-induced water shortage.
  4: Water shortage (droughts) leading to crop yield reduction, higher irrigation
    costs, reduced water levels in waterways, deterioration of water quality.
  5: Climate change and socio-economic developments leading to long-term drought risk;
    Declining water quality during droughts leading to production stops; Exceedance
    of concentration of indicating substances at water intakes.
  6: Climate change scenarios (temperature change, sea level rise, precipitation changes),
    socio-economic changes (population, economic growth, land use), changes in water
    extraction and demand.
  7: A warmer climate resulting in increased annual precipitation and reference evapotranspiration,
    but with uncertainty in precipitation patterns during the growing season; socio-economic
    growth scenarios (Stoom, Warm, Rust, Druk).
  8: Increased drought, salt water intrusion, low-flow periods in the Rhine, warmer
    climate.
  9: Shocks or changes impacting the outcomes include climate, land use, population,
    and policy actions.
  10: Drought and water shortage, future climate scenarios.
  11: Droughts causing water shortages impacting agriculture, shipping, drinking water
    production, industrial water use, urban water supply, water quality, and soil
    subsidence. Simultaneous droughts in neighboring countries.
Highlights:
  1: "Presents a method to quantify drought risk in the Netherlands under changing\
    \ future conditions and in response to policy actions, successfully applied to\
    \ the Netherlands\u2019 national drought risk management strategy."
  2: Demonstrates the applicability of the framework for policy actions in two regions
    of the Netherlands and provides decision support for the allocation of funds for
    drought risk mitigation.
  4: Droughts impact various sectors and national welfare can be assessed by combining
    the probability of water shortage with welfare effects, resulting in a drought
    risk curve. The models used allow calculating the expected annual economic impact.
  5: Adaptation investments in industry are aimed at maintaining a failure probability
    of 1/100yr-1; Drinking water companies increase consumer prices to cover adaptation
    costs.
  6: Policy actions are positively evaluated if the avoided drought risk is greater
    than or equal to the costs from a societal welfare perspective. The analysis includes
    both monetized effects based on calculated changes in drought risk and non-monetized
    effects provided by stakeholders.
  7: Drought risk in the Netherlands is estimated to increase significantly by 2050
    due to climate change; the opportune time to invest in adaptation measures is
    determined by the intersection of avoided drought risk and annual costs.
  8: Drought risk is dominated by agriculture; shipping faces a significant increase
    in drought risk due to low Rhine flows; policy actions have varying cost-benefit
    ratios depending on the region and scenario (Stoom).
  9: Projected increase in drought risk costs from current policy to 'Stoom2050' scenario
    with significant cost impact on agriculture.
  10: Dynamic simulation of drought risk allows quantitative evaluation of costs and
    benefits of planned drought adaptation investments and insight into the distribution
    of drought costs and benefits over different water users and regions.
  11: Provides a national-scale drought risk assessment and how costs and benefits
    are distributed over different regions and sectors. Demonstrates the use of a
    process-based drought risk assessment method to support decision-making under
    future uncertainty.
Methodology:
  1: Quantifies drought risk by integrating drought probability and socio-economic
    consequences across relevant sectors. Compares investment costs of policy actions
    with expected risk reduction to determine cost-effectiveness. Supports societal
    cost-benefit analysis.
  2: 'Integrated drought risk assessment framework based on dynamics simulation of
    the hydrological system coupled with economic impact models for agriculture, shipping,
    industry, and drinking water. Four steps: 1) Analyze drought probability using
    long time series of hydrological and meteorological variables. 2) Simulate the
    time series with a national hydrological model to obtain hydrological and human
    responses and then estimate the welfare effects of water shortage by coupling
    economic impact models. 3) Compare the costs of proposed policy actions with the
    calculated change in drought risks. 4) Determine the opportune time to invest.'
  4: Uses the National Water Model (NWM) to simulate drought propagation. Uses the
    Dutch agricultural cost model (AGRICOM) to propagate soil moisture deficits to
    crop yield reduction and irrigation costs. Employs an economic tool to assess
    the impact of crop yield reduction and higher irrigation costs on national welfare.
    Uses the Dutch inland transport analysis model BIVAS to estimate the impact of
    droughts on inland water transport. Monetizes drought impacts on soil subsidence,
    instability of peat embankments, water quality, and biodiversity loss with a shadow
    price.
  5: Estimates additional treatment capacity needed, using reverse osmosis treatment
    as a proxy for adaptation costs; Monetizes other effects using a shadow price
    of water based on agricultural impact model outcomes; Uses Delta scenarios combining
    climate change scenarios and socio-economic projections; Compares reference situation
    (current) with Stoom scenario (warm-dry climate with high growth) to represent
    range of future drought risk; Assumes adaptation investments maintain failure
    probability under future scenarios.
  6: Integrated drought risk assessment using climate change scenarios and socio-economic
    projections to evaluate the costs and benefits of policy actions. Uses the equal
    annual annuity (EAA) to compare measures with different lifespans, investments,
    and costs. Compares quantified risk reduction with annual cost for each policy
    action.
  7: Model simulations are used to estimate drought risk based on precipitation deficit
    and low-river-flow periods; cost-benefit evaluation of policy actions determines
    inclusion in drought risk management strategy; opportune time to invest is determined
    by interpolating results between reference and Stoom scenarios and averaging the
    effects; extrapolation beyond 2050 is limited to 100 years.
  8: "Integrated drought risk assessment framework combining time-series analysis\
    \ with process-based hydrological models, impact models, and economic cost\u2013\
    benefit analysis."
  9: The analysis uses a dynamic simulation approach to couple several impact models
    with a hydrological simulation model, and applies market valuation techniques
    and avoided cost approach.
  10: Dynamic simulation of drought risk to evaluate costs and benefits of planned
    drought adaptation investments; Cost-benefit analysis of short-term policy actions
    and long-term strategies.
  11: The paper develops and applies a process-based method for integrated drought
    risk assessment in the Netherlands. It couples hydrological models with socio-economic
    impact functions to monetize the impacts of drought-induced water shortage. The
    analysis models risk under future scenarios and assesses the cost-effectiveness
    of policy actions. Includes sensitivity analysis with different discount rates.
More Notes:
  1: The paper emphasizes the importance of integrated drought risk assessments for
    adaptive policymaking and long-term strategies.
  2: The assessment framework is used in the Dutch Delta Programme, a long-term government
    program to ensure that the Netherlands is climate-proof by 2050, including resilience
    to drought-induced water shortage. The long-term adaptation strategy and short-term
    policy actions are reassessed every 6 years.
  6: A standard discount rate of 3%-4.5% is prescribed by the Dutch government, with
    4.5% for public infrastructure investments with substantial fixed costs.
  7: The analysis considers both short-term and long-term policy actions for drought
    risk management.
  8: The 'Stoom' scenario seems to be a specific climate change scenario used in the
    analysis; policy actions also have non-monetized effects (recreation, reliability,
    heat stress).
  10: "The National Water Model is relatively complex with long computation times,\
    \ which limits the number of strategy\u2013scenario combinations that can be explored."
  11: A shadow price of water was applied, which introduces uncertainty. A dynamic
    impact model is lacking for some effects.
