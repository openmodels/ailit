Highlights:
  6: Climate change impacts on agriculture are a major challenge, impacting food security,
    nutritional security, and requiring changes in inputs, infrastructure, policy,
    governance and regulation.
  13: No relevant information
  19: Climate change impacts agriculture, particularly in rainfed areas dependent
    on monsoons, potentially decreasing cereal productivity by 10-40% by 2100.
  21: Increasing minimum temperatures accelerate respiration, hasten crop maturity,
    and reduce yields.
  23: Crop water requirements are projected to increase for the crops and districts
    listed, with varying percentage changes depending on the crop, district, and time
    period. For example, Anantapur (AP) groundnut is projected to have the highest
    percentage increase of 25.6% by 2050.
  29: No important outcomes of the analysis are discussed on this page.
  35: Agricultural diversification can lead to a reduction in poverty, increased average
    income, sustainable farming, efficient use of available resources, enhanced income,
    and a diversified food basket.
  42: Three significant regime shifts in Orissa's rainfall were identified in the
    20th century and changes in depression occurrences in the Bay of Bengal.
  44: Orissa experienced 99 extreme events between 1901-2000 (49 floods, 30 droughts,
    10 cyclones, 1 super cyclone).
  45: Annual rainfall in Orissa decreased from 1901-2000, while the standard deviation
    increased, indicating greater variability. The frequency of cyclonic disturbances
    (depressions) significantly decreased from 1949 onwards, compared to 1901-1948.
  50: Drought years occurred in 1996, 2000, and 2002; The number of drought months
    varies throughout the year, with December having the most (16) and July having
    none; Probability of a dry week is high (60-100%) in the first 23 weeks of the
    year
  55: Rainfall distribution during the soybean growing season is more important than
    the amount of rainfall for soybean yield. Drought spells during critical growth
    stages significantly reduce yield.
  56: Projected temperature increases in central India will likely reduce soybean
    yield by 20-35%.
  58: Significant reduction in soybean yield due to increased temperatures and drought
    spells; adaptation strategies include changing sowing dates and plant density.
  59: Increased plant density (from 50 to 60 plants/m2) can increase grain yield of
    soybean under climate change; advanced sowing dates and increased plant population
    can reduce the impact of climate change on crop yield; delaying sowing beyond
    early July does not mitigate temperature impacts.
  61: "Wheat crop yield in Uttar Pradesh for the 2009\u20132010 crop season is slightly\
    \ affected due to a rise in temperature during the grain-filling stage."
  62: Temperature variations significantly impact wheat yield outputs, with a noted
    reduction in yields under late sown conditions.

    studied in Uttar Pradesh (Faizabad, Allahabad, Kanpur, Varanasi) and East India
    (Jagdalpur, Raipur, Ranchi, Kalyani), with relatively consistent maturity days.
    Northwest India (unspecified locations) also assessed.

    and Jammu and Kashmir. GARP model can predict current apple niche areas with 92%
    accuracy.
  106: Installation of rubber dams in watersheds increased the production and productivity
    of rice crop, helped in taking second crop, thus increasing cropping intensity
    and net profit of the farmers.
  108: Rubber dams can serve as check dams when inflated and flood mitigation devices
    when deflated.
  109: Rubber dam installation led to a significant increase in crop productivity
    and cropping intensity, potentially enhancing farmers' gross returns.
  110: Rubber dams lead to significant yield enhancement of crops and increased farmer
    incomes.
  112: Increased severity of droughts and intensity of floods due to alteration in
    the hydrological cycle.

    periods are more prone to uncertainty. Frequent drought and flood occurrences
    in the Mahanadi delta in the last 25 years affected crop yield.
  115: Increased drought years from 1971 onwards are observed. Annual rainfall indicates
    an increasing trend, although rainfall decreased during the active monsoon months
    (July & August). Increased runoff during 1990-2004 compared to 1972-1989 is observed.
  117: Frequent drought and flood occurrences in the Mahanadi delta.
  119: Severe drought in October to December affected paddy yield adversely; Rainfall
    distribution affected crop yield adversely; Water is unavailable during the critical
    stages of crop growth despite canal irrigation.
  129: Farmers heavily rely on neighbors and dealers for agricultural information,
    despite the potential for inaccurate or commercially biased information.  Formal
    extension services (agricultural officers) are underutilized.
  156: Agriculture and vegetation are important for poverty reduction and absorbing
    CO2.
  163: Expected decline in wheat production and increased rice production in some
    regions due to climate variables.
  164: Climate change is likely to impact all the natural ecosystems as well as socioeconomic
    systems.
  166: The approach addresses crops grown in different seasons separately and accounts
    for substantial changes in seasonal weather directly, and avoids issues from trying
    to interpret a monetary equivalent of summed crop yields with fixed prices.
  171: There appears to be an inverted U-shape relationship between yield and temperature,
    indicating that temperature up to a certain point is beneficial and harmful thereafter.
    The difference across quantiles of yield of the inflection point is minimal. Rainfall
    also appears to have a similar relationship to yield as does temperature, and
    the coefficients across different quantiles are very different.
  172: Impact of temperature and rainfall variations on wheat and rice yields across
    different regions.
  173: Significant yield losses for the already lower productive districts
  175: Adverse impacts are more pronounced in highly productive regions (Punjab, Haryana,
    Uttar Pradesh) and dry regions (Gujarat, Rajasthan), while states like Bihar and
    West Bengal might be marginally benefited.
  176: Uniform climate change scenario indicates a significant loss in wheat production
    and possibly moderate gains in rice production in India. Impacts are most negative
    in the most productive districts, indicating losses in wheat production.
  178: Climate change leads to high uncertainty in crop production in the near future
    in the Northwest Himalaya.
  179: Climate change/variability on agricultural impacts in the northwest Himalayas
    has not received much adequate attention.
  183: Climate change may shift geographic distribution of pests and affect their
    incidence
  186: Delayed sowing significantly reduces grain yield in various crops in the Northwest
    Himalaya. Extreme weather events cause crop failures.
  187: Extreme weather events and changing climate are affecting various components
    of agriculture; adaptation strategies like winter x spring wheat derivatives and
    dual-purpose wheat cultivars can help ensure fodder and food security.
  192: Groundwater is declining significantly in Rajasthan due to over-exploitation,
    especially in desert margin areas.
  193: From 1998 onwards, the mean temperature of the state has shown a rising trend,
    increasing from 0.2 to 1.6 /C14C. Monsoon rains in the state have shown wide variability
    in the last decades.
  194: Peak month of monsoon rains in Jaipur district shifting from August to July;
    Arid districts (Barmer, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Jodhpur) witnessing floods and more
    rains in recent years.
  222: The MIKE SHE model is considered as calibrated as RMSE values show no significant
    difference between the actual and simulated groundwater levels for most wells.
    However, a detailed calibration may further improve the simulation accuracy. The
    observed and simulated values match well for 24 out of 31 stations.
  228: Future research needs are emphasized for sustainable development of water resources
    amid climate change.
  233: Agriculture remains the largest water consumer, and meeting future demand requires
    augmentation of existing water resources and conservation.
  238: Extensive groundwater resources exist in deeper confined aquifers, particularly
    in the Ganga-Brahmaputra alluvial plains, but detailed studies are needed to fully
    understand their yield potentials and characteristics. Climate change is likely
    to affect both the input and output of groundwater resources and to influence
    water quantity and quality.
  248: Emphasis on blending traditional knowledge with modern technology for effective
    adaptation.
  249: Weather insurance is identified as an effective strategy to offset losses due
    to extreme weather events. Public investment in agricultural research and development,
    especially in tools, technologies, and policies like NICRA, is highlighted. Encouraging
    partnerships between government, NGOs, and philanthropic organizations is important
    for adaptation preparedness.

    is needed.
More Notes:
  7: This page is a preface, likely from a paper about Sustainable Agriculture in
    India. The paper is connected to India's National Action Plan on Climate Change.
  9: This page primarily sets the stage for a volume of research on climate change
    and agriculture in India. It focuses on the importance of understanding the impacts
    of climate change on crop productivity, policy interventions, and adaptation/mitigation
    strategies within the agricultural sector. It emphasizes the need to consolidate
    existing insights and conduct future value-added investigations.
  13: This page is a table of contents. Most of the articles focus on agricultural
    impacts and adaptation in India at a regional or crop-specific level. While relevant
    to understanding sector-specific vulnerabilities and potential adaptation strategies,
    they don't directly address national-level macroeconomic or fiscal risks and costs/benefits
    in a way that can be extracted from *this page alone*. Further reading of the
    papers would be needed.
  19: The paper focuses on the paradox of climate resilience in agriculture, particularly
    in the context of India's strong socio-cultural and socio-economic bondages with
    farms and farming communities.
  21: The increasing temperature trend is more evident in central and eastern zones
    where rainfall is also showing a declining trend, an area requiring high attention
    for adaptation research.
  23: The table focuses on crop water requirements, a key factor influencing agricultural
    productivity, but it does not directly address the macroeconomic or fiscal consequences
    of these changes. The final section of the document mentions crop-based adaptation
    strategies, like developing crop varieties that fit changed rainfall and seasons
    or have high CO2 fertilizer, radiation and salinity use efficiency.
  29: The page primarily lists references to studies related to climate change adaptation
    and mitigation strategies in agriculture in India, with no specific insights or
    analyses provided.
  35: The paper suggests a need for agricultural diversification from the rice-wheat
    system to address environmental problems and reduce dependence on imports.
  42: No relevant information
  44: Table 2 shows a decreasing trend in decade-wise maximum, minimum, and average
    rainfall amounts with increasing standard deviations in the last century.
  50: "The time gap between drought years varies from 2 to more than 7 years.  The\
    \ definition of a 'drought month' is a month having less than 50% of average monthly\
    \ rainfall. Figure 2 shows variation of annual rainfall during the 1990\u2013\
    2009 period. Table 3 summarizes dry and wet spell analysis using a Markov chain\
    \ model"
  55: The study focuses on rainfed soybean crops in central India. Crop management
    practices can play a major role in future productivity.
  56: Delaying sowing dates is a potentially favourable adaptation option for increased
    soybean yields in this region.
  58: Adaptation strategies aim to mitigate yield loss by adjusting agricultural practices
    and developing new cultivars.
  59: The study focuses on a specific soybean cultivar (JS 335) grown in Bhopal, India,
    during the rainy season. The results are applicable to similar rainfed soybean
    farming conditions in central India. Water stress during the reproductive stage
    is a significant threat to yield.
  62: The study's objective is to assist government agencies in designing corrective

    lands, wetlands, and promoting green cover in urban areas. Encouraging community
    leadership and awareness is also suggested.
  164: Developing countries are more vulnerable to climate change than developed countries
    due to fragile ecological environments, high vulnerability, low-income levels,
    and less ability to cope.
  166: The analysis is based on findings of Krishnamurthy (2010) and uses data from
    the Indian Meteorological Department. The econometric model is for the impact
