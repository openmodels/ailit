Drivers of Risk:
  10: Climate change impacts leading to changes in tropical evergreen forest cover,
    aboveground live biomass, and soil carbon stocks.
  11: Climate drying and warming scenarios projected by various GCMs (General Circulation
    Models) such as HadCM3, HadGEM, NCAR, GISS, IPSL, MPI, CSIRO, and GFDL. The most
    extreme scenario is HadCM3.

Highlights:
  10: The analysis projects changes in key ecosystem variables (tropical evergreen
    forest cover, aboveground live biomass, and soil carbon stocks) in the Amazon
    Basin under different climate change scenarios to 2100. The projections include
    confidence intervals.
  11: HadCM3 climate projection results in the largest vegetation carbon losses. Changes
    in vegetation carbon are highly variable between models.
  28: The table shows how the correlation between soil carbon storage and different
    plant parameters changes from wet to dry climates.
Methodology:
  10: The analysis uses general circulation models (GCMs) to project future changes
    in ecosystem variables under different climate scenarios. Some model outputs are
    benchmarked against observed biomass estimates. A variance partitioning model
    is used with parameter sets that meet the benchmarking criteria.
  11: The analysis uses multiple GCMs to project changes in vegetation carbon stocks
    and tropical evergreen cover under different climate scenarios. The models considered
    are MPI ECHAM5, NCAR PCM1, HadCM3, HadGEM, CSIRO MK3, GFDL 2.1, GISS ER, and IPSL
    CM4.
  28: The study uses partial correlation coefficients to assess the relationship between
    soil carbon storage and various plant-related parameters at different flux sites,
    ordered by dry season length.
More Notes:
  10: The paper focuses on the Amazon Basin and does not directly assess macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level. The provided information is limited
    to the impact of climate change on carbon storage within the Amazon.
  11: Parameters related to vegetation dynamics and water use are important in determining
    the magnitude of changes in carbon stocks.
  28: The study focuses on ecological parameters related to carbon storage, not direct
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. Therefore, the page's relevance to a review
    of macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks of climate change and adaptation costs/benefits
    is limited. The table only indicates which parameters were selected for use in
    basin-wide simulation, suggesting a further step of modelling.

  32: This page primarily presents numerical data related to climate modeling parameters,
    specifically concerning tropical evergreen cover and evapotranspiration rates.
    While it mentions "partial correlation coefficients," it does not directly present
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, adaptation costs/benefits, or risk drivers
    at a national level. The numerical values listed appear to be model parameters
    or coefficients, not direct measures of GDP effects, fiscal balance, or other
    relevant outcomes.
Outcome(s) of Interest:

  11: Change in vegetation carbon stocks is linked to climate scenarios. These changes
    could potentially impact economic productivity related to agriculture and forestry.

Quantitative material:

    \ cover (58.79%), Aboveground C-storage (48.79 PgC), Belowground C-storage (35.13\
    \ PgC). Figure 5 shows projected changes from 2000 to 2100 in tropical evergreen\
    \ forest cover (%), aboveground live biomass (Pg C), and soil carbon stocks (Pg\
