Highlights:
  2: "investor\u2019s demand curves are a function of prices and char- acteristics"
  3: "Characteristics are important for a firm\u2019s expected future profitability\
    \ and riskiness, influencing asset prices. Active investors can influence valuation\
    \ ratios. There is substantial heterogeneity in demand curves of institutional\
    \ investors."
  5: Foreign investors help lower the cost of capital for green firms in the US.
  7: Long-term investors, banks, and passive investment advisors benefit from the
    transition, while active investment advisors and hedge funds experience a decline
    in AUM.
  8: The paper focuses on analyzing the transition from active to passive management
    and the pricing of climate-related risks in financial markets. It also emphasizes
    the role of hedge funds in the analysis.
  19: The characteristics of a firm explain a substantial fraction of the cross-sectional
    variation in future profitability.
  24: "Firm dividend policy responds to valuation ratios, but the estimate of h1,k\
    \ is relatively small, so ignoring the endogeneity of a firm's payout policy does\
    \ not significantly affect the estimate of \u03B20,i."
  26: Larger, passive, and foreign investors have a stronger demand for greener firms.
    Foreign investors tend to tilt away from firms with entrenched management. Demand
    is more elastic for smaller and more active investors. Foreign investors tilt
    their portfolios more strongly towards greener and less entrenched firms and prefer
    to hold safer firms.
  27: The study computes the average change in valuations due to capital flows from
    one or a group of investors.
  28: Small-active investment advisors and hedge funds have the largest impact on
    prices; Hedge funds play an outsized role in mispricing per dollar of AUM; Long-term
    investors have a modest impact on prices.
  29: Small active investment advisors have the largest impact on the pricing of the
    environmental index; foreign investors have the opposite effect
  30: Small-active investment advisors and hedge funds are important for the pricing
    of governance in US markets.
  31: Institutional investors have become more passive over time, impacting different
    firms and investors.
  32: Latent demand and demand elasticities equally reduced the active share from
    2007-2019. Portfolio tilts increased investors' active share during the same period.
  34: Re-activating investors shifts coefficients on environmental and governance
    characteristics closer to zero. Trend from active to passive management makes
    firm characteristics increasingly important in explaining valuation ratios. If
    investors were as active in 2007 as 2019, small-active investment advisors would
    experience a 6.9% increase in assets under management and hedge funds would experience
    a 14.1% increase, while other institutional investors would decline.
  35: Physical risks are considered to be most important over longer horizons (30
    years), whereas regulatory risk is considered the main risk over the next five
    years.
  36: A broad shift in investor preferences towards green firms has a larger impact
    than regulatory changes targeting only long-term investors. Regulating insurance
    companies may not significantly impact asset prices. Long-term investors, banks,
    and passive investors are the main beneficiaries of the transition, while hedge
    funds and active investors are exposed to climate-related transition risk.
  37: The paper develops a framework to quantitatively assess how different investors
    contribute to incorporating information (including climate-related risks) into
    prices and long-horizon expected returns.
  38: "Foreign investors are important for valuation of green firms, and small-active\
    \ investment advisors are important for the valuation of well-governed firms;\
    \ the methodology can be used to develop \u201Cclimate-risk stress tests\u201D"
  42: Institutional investors are key in affecting the market valuation of climate
    risks.

  49: Different investor types have different sensitivities to repricing, as reflected
    by the 'Repricing AUM scaled' metric. Hedge funds exhibit the highest repricing
    AUM scaled, while large passive investors exhibit the lowest.
  51: The regression coefficients show the influence of environment, governance, and
    other financial metrics on market-to-book ratios, indicating varying levels of
    significance and impact.
  52: The change in valuation regression coefficients show the impact of institutional
    investors caring more about the environment.

  57: Summary of demand curves by investor domicile.
  59: Shows an increasing trend in the aggregate active share of institutional investors
    from 1980-2018 and 2000-2019.
  60: The aggregate active share decreased from 2007 to 2019, and this change can
    be attributed to changes in latent demand, characteristics demand, and demand
    elasticities.
  64: "An investor\u2019s demand for a given stock depends on its expected return,\
    \ riskiness, and the hedging benefit it provides."
  65: "Valuation ratios depend on \u03BDx (n), which creates an identification challenge\
    \ requiring the use of an instrumental variables estimator."
  67: The methodology satisfies the moment conditions upon convergence. The valuation
    regressions and earnings predictability regressions connect to traditional variance
    decompositions.
Methodology:
  3: Estimates a cross-sectional valuation regression and an asset demand system using
    quarterly US data from 2000 to 2019.
  5: Re-estimation of cross-sectional valuation regression using counterfactual prices
    to understand investor impact on firm characteristics pricing.
  8: The paper develops an instrumental variables shrinkage estimator and uses a simple
    model to illustrate how various investors impact price formation. It uses a two-period
    model with constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) preferences.
  19: Estimates the asset demand system using equations (10) and (11) and aims to
    estimate the demand curve of investor *i*, which can be written as equation (14).
  20: The instrument is constructed using counterfactual prices, computed by assuming
    investors hold equal-weighted portfolios of stocks within their investment universe.
  21: The paper proposes an alternative econometric strategy by augmenting the standard
    GMM moment conditions derived from equation (15) with a ridge penalty (Hoerl and
    Kennard 1970). It utilizes quarterly data to estimate the model. The estimation
    procedure, including a fast numerical procedure to implement the estimator, is
    detailed in Appendix C.
  23: "The paper models the dependence of certain characteristics on valuation ratios\
    \ and uses a two-step estimation process to estimate investors\u2019 demand."
  24: Uses estimated residuals as instruments instead of x1,t(n) in estimating the
    demand curve to address endogeneity issues.
  26: The paper uses regression analysis to determine how investor characteristics
    affect demand for different types of firms. The analysis is applicable to understanding
    investor behavior in financial markets, specifically concerning demand for firms
    with environmental and governance characteristics.
  27: The analysis uses a demand system to measure the impact of investors on asset
    valuations and solves for market-clearing prices using an algorithm by Koijen
    and Yogo.
  28: "The study reallocates assets from one group of investors to all others and\
    \ reports the resulting repricing measure (\u03B8) to assess the impact of different\
    \ investor types on asset prices. The analysis is based on the distribution of\
    \ Assets Under Management (AUM) across investor types."
  29: The paper computes counterfactual equilibrium prices and valuation ratios to
    assess the link between characteristics and valuation ratios by examining flows
    from one group of investors to all other investors, based on regressions from
    other work
  30: Uses the valuation model of Cohen, Polk, and Vuolteenaho (2003) and Campbell,
    Polk, and Vuolteenaho (2009) to map changes in valuations to expected returns.
  31: Estimated asset demand system is used to analyze the impact of the transition
    from active to passive management on the cross-section of valuations and the welfare
    of investors.
  32: "The page decomposes the active share of investors into three components: latent\
    \ demand, portfolio tilts to characteristics, and elastic demand. Portfolio weights\
    \ are computed using a formula based on \u03B20i, \u02C6\u03B21i, and \u03F5it\
    \ (n). The analysis focuses on the period from 2007 to 2019."
  34: Regression analysis of firm valuations (mbt(n) and mbCFt(n) - mbt(n)) on firm
    characteristics in the last quarter of 2019. Simulation of changes in assets under
    management if institutional investors were as active in 2019 as in 2007.
  35: The framework is used to quantify two key dimensions of climate-related risks
    by considering counterfactuals related to regulatory risk and stakeholder risk
    and the impact of those risks on asset demand.
  36: Regression analysis with changes in log market-to-book ratios is used. Counterfactual
    scenarios are constructed by increasing the environmental score for institutional
    investors.
  37: The paper proposes a framework to model the impact of a carbon tax on firm valuations
    by adjusting profits based on carbon emissions data. It also suggests modeling
    the impact of physical damages on future cash flows of exposed firms using observable
    characteristics to capture risk. It describes a comprehensive framework to conduct
    'climate stress tests'.
  38: "Uses an estimated asset demand system to analyze the impact of active to passive\
    \ management transition and climate-related risks on firm valuations and investors\u2019\
    \ welfare"
  42: Econometric analysis, financial modeling, analysis of institutional investor
    behavior, demand system approach to asset pricing.
  45: The analysis examines the firm size distribution by market capitalization decile,
    using annual firm-level fundamentals data from CRSP and Compustat. The results
    are applicable to the specific time periods of 2000 Q1 and 2019 Q4.
  46: Equity holdings data are from FactSet. Data pertain to 2019 Q4.
  47: 'Regressions of end-of-year valuation ratios on firm-level characteristics with
    year fixed effects; t-statistics are clustered by year. Analysis performed for
    two time periods: 2010-2019 and 2000-2019.'
  48: time-series
  49: Analysis uses holdings data from FactSet, firm-level fundamentals from CRSP
    and Compustat, and covers the period from 2000 to 2019. Total repricing is calculated
    as the percent change in market cap if assets of an investor type are reallocated
    as flows to all other institutional investors in proportion to their assets. Repricing
    AUM scaled is total repricing divided by share of assets under management; values
    are time series averages of quarterly values.
  51: The methodology involves regression analysis of market-to-book ratios using
    characteristics standardized by year, focusing on a scenario where institutional
    demand curves re-activate to 2007 levels.
  52: The analysis uses regressions to assess how changes in ESG considerations impact
    company valuations, as measured by log market-to-book ratios. The analysis is
    applicable to end-of-year data for 2019.
  55: Estimates are from a model that allows for endogenous dividend-to-book or the
    instrument for market equity is constructed omitting hedge funds; Firm-level fundamentals
    are from CRSP and Compustat; Holdings data are from FactSet; The sample runs from
    2000 to 2019.
  57: We report the weighted average of the parameter estimates for each investor
    in that group. To average the coefficients, we first compute the AUM-share weighted
    average for a given investor group and year. We then average these across years
    for a given investor group. Firm-level fundamentals are from CRSP and Compustat.
    Holdings data are from FactSet. The sample runs from 2000 to 2019. Governance
    and Environment data begins in 2010.
  59: Aggregate active share is calculated as the AUM (Assets Under Management) weighted
    active share across all institutional investors. Active share is one-half times
    the sum of the absolute value of active weights. Active weights are portfolio
    weights minus market weights within the set of stocks held for each manager. This
    figure presents the yearly average of quarterly aggregate active share.
  60: The aggregate active share is calculated as the AUM (Assets Under Management)
    weighted active share across all institutional investors. Active share is one-half
    times the sum of the absolute value of active weights. Active weights are portfolio
    weights minus market weights within the set of stocks held for each manager. The
    change in active share is decomposed into changes due to latent demand, characteristics
    demand, and demand elasticities. Holdings data are from FactSet. Firm-level fundamentals
    are from CRSP and Compustat.
  64: The paper uses rolling regressions to calculate betas and winsorizes data at
    specified levels. It merges data from various sources (CRSP, Compustat, FactSet,
    Sustainalytics) using CUSIP identifiers. It derives equations for investor demand
    and asset pricing based on expected returns, riskiness, and hedging benefits.
  65: The paper uses an instrumental variables estimator to address identification
    challenges. A ridge-IV estimator is used for the demand curve. The analysis modifies
    standard GMM moment conditions to impose a shrinkage penalty.
  67: The paper uses an iterative procedure based on a first-order Taylor expansion
    of moment conditions to estimate parameters. Convergence is achieved when the
    moment conditions are satisfied, with the adjustment step for coefficients limited
    to 1 or -1 for numerical stability. Initial estimates are obtained by omitting
    zero holdings and using linear moment conditions. Variance decompositions connect
    valuation regressions and earnings predictability regressions.

  28: The direct impact of brokers on asset prices is small due to their relatively
    small size in the US stock market, but they may have a larger indirect impact
    by extending leverage to other investors. The AUM share is correlated with the
    repricing measure.
  30: The analysis converts valuation estimates to expected returns assuming expected
    growth rates and expected returns are random walks.

    factors affecting average demand. It also seems to analyze sales, dividend information,
    and fund manager characteristics, considering foreign/domestic breakdowns, and
    using data from sources like MSCI, Sustainalytics, and Compustat. It is not possible
    to extract a clear summary without the full context of the study.

  5: A one standard deviation increase in the environmental index leads to a 17% increase
    in valuations, dropping to 14% with reallocation from foreign investors, and increasing
    to 21% with reallocation from small-active investment advisors.
  7: Long-term investors, banks, and passive investment advisors benefit from the
    transition, while active investment advisors and hedge funds experience a decline
    in AUM.

  24: Illustrates the robustness of our results to this particular form of endogeneity
    via a high correlation between benchmark estimator and estimator discussed in
    the section, suggesting that the estimate of h1,k is relatively small.
  26: R-squared values for regressions of demand curve coefficients on institutional
    type are 48% and 59%. R-squared values for regressions of environmental index
    coefficients on investor characteristics (log AUM, active share, foreign investor
    indicator) are low.
  28: Reallocating assets of small-active investment advisors leads to a 26.7% total
    repricing in the market; Reallocating assets of long-term investors leads to a
    3.9% repricing; Reallocating assets of brokers leads to a 1.8% repricing; Hedge
    funds have an outsized role with a mispricing per dollar of AUM ratio equal to
    3.58; Passive investment advisors and long-term investors have mispricing per
    dollar of AUM ratios around one.
  29: A one standard deviation increase in the environmental score would move prices
    by 14% instead of 17% if foreign investors leave the US market
  30: A one standard deviation change in the entrenchment index would only lead to
    a 9% change in a firm's valuation ratio as opposed to a 10% decline.
  31: A one standard deviation change in the environmental index changes valuation
    ratios by 4%, which translates to 20bp per annum.
  32: The page describes a decomposition of the decline in 'active share' from 2007
    to 2019, and states that latent demand and demand elasticities contributed equally
    to the reduction, while portfolio tilts to characteristics increased investors'
    active share.
  34: A one-standard deviation change in the environmental index increases valuation
    ratios by 23% in 2019, but this would reduce by 14% if investors are as active
    as in 2007; the entrenchment index response would reduce toward zero from -14%
    to -5% per one standard deviation increase.
  35: A shift of 0.1 implies that the portfolio weight increases by 10% for a one
    standard deviation change in the environmental score, thus from a baseline level
    of 5%, say, to 5.5%.
  36: Coefficient increases by 0.57 from an original value of 0.23 in the stakeholder
    risk counterfactual. Coefficient increases by 0.03 from 0.23 in the regulatory
    risk counterfactual.
