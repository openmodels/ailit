Drivers of Risk:
  6: Investors and regulators are increasingly concerned about the impact of climate-related
    risks on asset prices, investors' welfare, and financial stability.
  7: Regulatory risk and stakeholder risk (changing preferences of employees and customers).
  8: Climate-related risks
  18: Environmental scores and governance scores of firms
  28: No relevant information
  34: Changes in investors' demand elasticity (active vs. passive management).
  35: Climate-related risks including regulatory risk and stakeholder risk, with a
    focus on physical risks over longer horizons.
  36: Changes in investor demand for green firms due to stakeholder risk (all investors)
    or regulatory risk (insurance companies and pension funds).
  38: "Climate-related risks (due to changes in regulation or changes stakeholders\u2019\
    \ preferences) affect asset prices."

Highlights:
  1: increased demand for green firms would benefit long-term investors, banks, and
    passive investment advisors at the expense of hedge funds and small-active investment
    advisors.
  6: If the trend from active to passive management continues, it would strengthen
    the relation between valuations and characteristics.
  7: The paper finds that long-term investors, banks, and passive investment advisors
    benefit from the transition to a more environmentally-conscious economy, while
    active investment advisors and hedge funds would experience a decline in AUM.
    The framework can be used to develop and implement 'climate stress tests'.
  8: The model illustrates how to measure the importance of various investors in price
    formation
  18: Environmental score is positively correlated with firm's market-to-book ratio;
    governance score (entrenchment index) is negatively correlated with firm's market-to-book
    ratio.
  28: Small-active investment advisors and hedge funds have the largest impact on
    prices. Hedge funds play an outsized role in mispricing per dollar of AUM.
  34: A shift from active to passive investment management increases the importance
    of environmental and governance characteristics in explaining valuation ratios.
  35: Regulatory risk is considered the main risk over the next five years, with physical
    risks seen as more important over a 30-year horizon.
  36: A broad shift in investor preferences towards green firms has a larger impact
    on asset prices than regulatory changes affecting only long-term investors. Long-term
    investors, banks, and passive investors are the main beneficiaries of the transition,
    while hedge funds and active investors are exposed to climate-related transition
    risk.
  38: Foreign investors are particularly important for the valuation of green firms,
    while small-active investment advisors are important for the valuation of well-governed
    firms.
  40: No relevant information
  47: Environmental scores have a statistically significant positive relationship
    with valuation ratios (mb) in both time periods. Governance scores have a statistically
    significant negative relationship with valuation ratios (mb) in the 2010-2019
    period.
  49: The table highlights the different levels of 'Repricing' and 'Repricing AUM
    Scaled' across various investor types (e.g., Large Passive, Small Passive, Small
    Active, Hedge Funds).
  51: Environmental scores and Governance scores are significant drivers of firm valuation
    (market-to-book ratios).
  52: Increasing the importance of environmental scores for all investors has a positive
    impact on firm valuation; focusing only on long-term investors increases this
    effect.
  53: The figure shows the time series of ownership by institutional type from 2000
    to 2015.
  54: The figure presents estimates of coefficients on log market-to-book for various
    investment universe constructions.
Methodology:
  1: develop a new framework to quantitatively connect valuations, expected returns,
    and characteristics to the demands of institutional investors and households.
    Using investor-level holdings data, we estimate asset demand as a function of
    prices and characteristics
  6: The analysis uses a framework to quantify dimensions of climate-related risks,
    but does not comprehensively analyze all risks due to different risk dimensions.
  7: The paper designs two counterfactuals to capture regulatory and stakeholder risk
    for long-term investors. It computes asset prices and investors' AUM in these
    counterfactuals and assesses the changes. Portfolio holdings data is used to learn
    about valuations and expected returns.
  8: Develops an instrumental variables shrinkage estimator to estimate investor-specific
    demand curves; presents a simple model to illustrate how to measure the importance
    of various investors in price formation
  18: Panel regression of valuation ratios on characteristics (environmental scores,
    governance scores, log book equity, productivity, markup variables, stock market
    beta, etc.) with year fixed effects, using annual end-of-year data from 2000 to
    2019 and 2010 to 2019.
  28: The paper reallocates the assets of one group of investors to all others and
    reports the resulting repricing measure. They also compute the ratio of the repricing
    measure to the AUM share.
  34: Regression analysis of firm valuations (mbt(n) and mbCFt(n) - mbt(n)) on firm
    characteristics in the last quarter of 2019; simulation of changes in assets under
    management with different levels of investor activity.
  35: Quantification framework to assess climate-related risks, using survey insights
    to guide focus on regulatory risk and stakeholder risk.
  36: Regression analysis using log market-to-book ratios in 2019 and changes in log
    market-to-book in counterfactual scenarios.
  38: The authors use an estimated asset demand system to analyze the impact of trends
    in the asset management industry.

  47: 'Regressions of end-of-year valuation ratios on firm-level characteristics,
    including environmental and governance scores. Regressions include year fixed
    effects. T-statistics are clustered by year. Two time periods are considered:
    2010-2019 (when Environment and Governance data are available) and 2000-2019.'
  49: The analysis calculates the impact on market capitalization ('Total Repricing')
    when assets are reallocated between investor types. 'Repricing AUM scaled' is
    calculated as 'Total Repricing' divided by 'Share AUM'. Values are time series
    averages of quarterly values from 2000 to 2019, using data from FactSet, CRSP,
    and Compustat.

    ratios on firm characteristics; Counterfactual scenario where institutional demand
    curves in 2019 re-activated to 2007 levels; Characteristics standardized cross-sectionally
    by year
  52: Regression analysis of log market-to-book ratios on company characteristics
    (ESG, governance, financials).
  53: The analysis uses equity holdings data from FactSet, calculating the annual
    average share of ownership by institution type.
  54: The analysis computes investment universes for varying backward and forward
    windows (trailing and forward years), with baseline estimates using 3 years back
    and 0 years forward. It calculates AUM weighted coefficients on log market-to-book.
More Notes:
  1: The analysis includes environmental and governance measures as characteristics
    influencing asset demand.
  6: The paper addresses broader policy questions related to the trend from active
    to passive management and its effects on asset prices and investor welfare.
  8: Focuses on asset pricing and investor behavior, not directly on macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes related to climate change.
  18: The characteristics used in the regression explain 64% of the variation in the
    panel of valuation ratios after projecting out year fixed effects.
  28: The impact of brokers on asset prices may be larger than their direct impact
    due to factors like extending leverage.
  34: The analysis suggests that a continuation of the trend toward passive management
    could lead to underperformance of hedge funds and small-active investment advisors
    relative to other investors.
  36: The paper focuses on the impact of transition risk on firm valuations and investor
    portfolios, specifically examining how shifts in investor demand for green firms
    affect these outcomes. The analysis does not address direct macroeconomic or fiscal
    impacts at a national level, but rather financial market consequences of climate-related
    policy.

  28: Repricing impact if assets of small-active investment advisors are reallocated
    is 26.7%; Long-term investors move prices by 3.9%; Brokers move prices by 1.8%;
