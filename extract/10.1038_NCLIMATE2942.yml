Drivers of Risk:
  1: Rising aridity, changes in temperature and precipitation projected by climate
    models (CMIP5 RCP 8.5).
  3: Changes in grassland fCover, potentially driven by temperature-driven evaporation
    and changes in precipitation frequency and intensity.
  4: Changes in mean annual temperature, precipitation, and CO2 levels affect grassland
    fCover (fractional vegetation cover) and GPP (gross primary productivity).
Highlights:
  1: Grassland productivity in North America is projected to increase despite rising
    aridity, due to shifts in growth towards earlier spring emergence and delayed
    autumn senescence.
  3: The overall trend in fCover varied among regions, and regional patterns were
    typically, but not always, driven by trends in precipitation.
  4: "Model results indicate increases in the total annual grassland GPP (annual productivity\
    \ estimated as fCover scaled to GPP) of 52 \xB1 55/38 gCm-2 or 0.11 \xB1 0.08\
    \ Pg (76 \xB1 57/28 gCm-2 or 0.08 \xB1 0.06 Pg C, for the areas with a significant\
    \ change)."
Methodology:
  1: "A coupled vegetation\u2013hydrological model constrained with daily measures\
    \ of vegetation greenness (Gcc from PhenoCam imagery) and validated with ANPP\
    \ data and satellite-derived fCover. Predictions made using downscaled CMIP5 climate\
    \ projections (RCP 8.5)."
  3: CMIP5 climate projections were used to model changes in grassland fCover between
    2010-2020 and 2090-2100.
  4: Modelled fCover changes and related these to GPP using regression-based estimates.
    The model accounts for changes in growing season length as well as summer droughts
    on GPP.
More Notes:
  3: The study focuses on grassland ecosystems in North America.
  4: The model does not account for the effects of CO2 on productivity through increases
    in photosynthesis and water use efficiency, therefore likely representing an underestimate.
No relevant information:
  2: This page focuses on climate change impacts on grassland fractional cover (fCover)
    and aridity, without directly addressing macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes.
    The information is primarily ecological and biophysical, lacking quantitative
    estimates of GDP effects, fiscal balances, or costs/benefits of adaptation at
    a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Increases in productivity of North American grasslands.
  3: No relevant information
  4: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: Widespread increases in grassland fCover over the coming century across the majority
    of North American grasslands are indicated.
  3: "the integrated annual grassland fCover of 18 \xB114/9% across the grassland\
    \ ecosystems in North America (we report the ensemble mean \xB11s.d./1s.d.,where\
    \ the first is the standard deviation of the spatial mean across the 10 climate\
    \ scenarios, and the second is the standard deviation of the ensemble mean of\
    \ the climate scenarios across all modelled gridcells)."
  4: "Projects an average growing season increase of 4 \xB1 2 weeks at the Lethbridge\
    \ site."
