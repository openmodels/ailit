  18: No specific shocks or changes impacting outcomes are identifiable from the text
    provided.
  20: Higher temperatures may disincentivize urbanization by causing adverse economic
    shocks, such as those related to agricultural production.

  23: Temperature (current and lagged).
  24: Global warming (temperature)
  25: Increasing temperatures
  26: Temperature, Precipitation, Cloud Cover, Ground Frost, Potential Evapotranspiration
  27: Higher levels of urbanization potentially influencing local temperature due
    to factors like deforestation, changes in albedo, and increased air pollution.
  28: Temperature increases; Urbanization
  30: Rising temperatures (global warming).
  32: Rising temperatures (global warming)
  33: Global warming impacts rural-urban migration, affecting countries with poor
    starting conditions.
  34: Global warming, particularly increasing temperatures, impacts rural push and
    urban pull dynamics, encouraging rural-urban migration.
Highlights:
  2: Higher temperatures correlate with higher urbanization rates in the long run,
    especially in poorer, agriculture-dependent countries with an urban bias, and
    in initially non-urban countries in hotter climate zones.
  3: Higher temperatures are related to higher urbanization rates in the long run;
    this relationship is particularly relevant to countries characterized by relative
    economic and institutional underdevelopment and strong dependence on agriculture;
    the relationship matters more strongly to initially non-urban countries in hotter
    climate zones; warming contributes to losses in agricultural productivity and
    pro-urban shifts in public goods provision.
  4: The study differentiates between short-run and long-run effects of global warming
    on urbanization. It identifies country-specific mediators, such as initial urban
    bias, that influence the relationship. It corroborates that rising temperatures
    undermine agricultural productivity and shows that temperature increases correlate
    with stronger differences in the provision of public goods between urban and rural
    areas.
  5: Higher temperatures reduce agricultural productivity and lower agricultural wages,
    increasing the wage differential between rural and urban sectors, and promoting
    rural-urban migration.
  6: Higher temperatures are hypothesized to be related to higher levels of urbanization.
  9: The relationship between increasing temperatures and urbanization is expected
    to be stronger in countries with a relatively large agricultural sector (H7).
    The relationship between increasing temperatures and urbanization is expected
    to be stronger in countries with a more pronounced urban bias (H8).
  12: "There has been a clear positive trend in temperatures, estimating that the\
    \ mean temperature increased by approximately 1 \xB0C from 1960 to 2016."
  13: Strong evidence of cross-sectional dependence in urbanization and temperature
    data, necessitating robust method.
  16: Higher temperatures are usually associated with lower urbanization levels; This
    finding is driven by low-income countries.
  18: The important outcomes of the analysis are obscured in the text and cannot be
    determined.
  20: Higher temperatures are associated with less urbanization in the short run,
    with the association being statistically significant but quantitatively small.
  22: Increases in temperature are linked to more urbanization in the long run. The
    long-run association between temperature and urbanization is more pronounced than
    the short-run one. The association between temperature and urbanization becomes
    less pronounced when further controls are added.
  23: Higher temperatures are associated with less urbanization in the short run but
    more urbanization in the long run. This result is robust to various alternative
    specifications and variable measurements.
  24: There is a negative relationship between temperature and urbanization, with
    coefficient values and significance levels presented in the table for various
    model specifications.
  25: The effect of climate change on urbanization primarily emerges via increasing
    temperatures.
  26: Temperature has a statistically significant impact on urbanization, both in
    the short and long run. The impact of other agro-climatic variables (precipitation,
    cloud cover, ground frost, potential evapotranspiration) on urbanization is also
    assessed.
  27: Instrumental variable analysis suggests a positive long-run effect of temperature
    on urbanization.
  28: Higher levels of urbanization are associated with higher temperatures, especially
    in the long run, but this link is likely driven by omitted variables and endogeneity.
    The effect of temperature increases on urbanization may be stronger in initially
    hot and non-urban countries, as well as in poor and agriculture-dependent countries
    exhibiting an urban bias.
  30: Rising temperatures correlate with urbanization, especially in countries that
    lack resources to adapt, distribute these resources inadequately, and are dependent
    on agricultural production.
  32: Increases in temperature are linked to lower agricultural productivity and public
    goods provision in countries with unfavorable starting conditions, especially
    in the long run. The long-run coefficient associated with temperature becomes
    smaller when agricultural productivity and public goods provision are accounted
    for, which speaks to partial mediation effects. This linkage is confined to countries
    with more unfavorable initial conditions.
  33: Significant long-run positive effect of temperature increase on urbanization,
    especially in countries with unfavorable conditions.
  34: The study suggests a pronounced relationship between global warming and rural-urban
    migration, especially in poorer economies.
Methodology:
  2: Panel vector error correction models
  3: Country-level data on temperature for 118 countries between 1960 and 2016 is
    linked to national urbanization rates to examine the relationship between urbanization
    and global warming.
  4: The study uses statistical tests and econometric methods to account for data
    features like non-stationarity, cointegration, and cross-sectional dependence.
    It differentiates between short-run and long-run linkages using dynamic fixed-effects
    estimators in a panel vector error correction framework. It also explores heterogeneous
    linkages governed by country-specific mediators and potential transmission channels
    via mediation analysis.
  5: Applies the push-pull framework of migration (Lee, 1966) to analyze the impact
    of global warming on rural-urban migration and urbanization. Focuses on agriculture
    and the provision of public goods as transmission channels.
  6: The authors argue that higher temperatures simultaneously push people from rural
    areas and pull them to urban areas due to the effect on the agricultural sector
    and the provision of public goods.
  9: Panel data analysis for 118 countries from 1960-2016. Requires a fully balanced
    panel.
  12: "Analyzes weather data from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East\
    \ Anglia at a 0.5\xB0 x 0.5\xB0 grid resolution and spatially aggregates the climate\
    \ data to the country-level."
  13: Cross-sectional dependence tested using bias-adjusted LM test and weak dependence
    test by Pesaran; calls for robust econometric methods.
  16: Traditional fixed-effects approach; Panel cointegration tests
  18: The text implies the use of fixed effects models and includes various specifications,
    but lacks clarity and coherence.
  20: The analysis uses a panel vector error correction model to examine the relationship
    between urbanization and temperature, accounting for cross-sectional dependence,
    non-stationarity, and cointegration.
  22: The paper uses a cointegration analysis to assess the long-run relationship
    between temperature and urbanization. The analysis accounts for potential omitted
    variable bias and selection bias using the Oster (2019) approach, which examines
    the degree of selection on unobservables relative to observables necessary to
    eliminate the observed association.
  23: Regression analysis using first-differenced variables with two or three lags;
    alternative temperature measures weighting by population size or agricultural
    land; alternative urbanization measures (logged rate and total population). The
    analysis examines short-run and long-run effects.
  24: Dynamic fixed-effects models are used to estimate the relationship between temperature
    and urbanization.
  25: Panel vector error correction models, pooled mean-group estimator
  26: Dynamic fixed-effects panel vector error correction models. Driscoll-Kraay standard
    errors are used. Short-run coefficients can vary between countries, while long-run
    coefficients are restricted to be equal across countries.
  27: Two-stage least squares instrumental variable models using mean temperature
    in proximate countries to address endogeneity and establish causality between
    temperature and urbanization.
  28: Regression analysis with temperature as the dependent variable and urbanization
    as an independent variable, using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Instrumental
    Variables (IV) models. They also use interaction terms to test if the relationship
    between temperature and urbanization is different depending on country-specific
    conditions (initial temperature, initial urbanization, poverty, agriculture dependence,
    urban bias).
  30: Panel vector error correction estimates.
  32: 'Mediation analysis consisting of two steps: 1) study the association between
    temperature and the mediator variables, 2) assess how the long-run coefficient
    associated with the correlation between temperature and urbanization changes when
    related mediation variables are included. Cluster analysis is used to identify
    countries with unfavorable starting conditions.'
  33: Econometric methods considering cross-sectional dependence, non-stationarity,
    and cointegration for a sample of 118 countries between 1960 and 2016.
  34: Empirical analysis of the relationship between increasing temperatures and urbanization,
    with suggestions of causation being challenged by latent variables.
More Notes:
  2: The relationship between global warming and urbanization is partly mediated through
    losses in agricultural productivity and pro-urban shifts in public goods provision.
  3: The study relies on a push-pull model of internal migration to explain the global
    warming-urbanization nexus.
  5: The paper argues that global warming influences the relative attractiveness of
    rural and urban areas, thus overall patterns of internal migration.
  6: The paper acknowledges counterarguments that climate change could decrease migration
    flows, especially in low-income countries, as urban areas may be more vulnerable
    to climate change impacts like rising sea levels and flooding.
  9: The analysis controls for the effect of urban bias, which is the prioritization
    of urban areas over rural areas in terms of public investment and access to markets,
    institutions, and public goods. City-states are excluded because urbanization
    rates do not vary over time.
  12: The study finds a nearly perfectly linear trend in the urbanization rate.
  13: No relevant information
  18: The page contains fragmented expressions and lacks coherent information; mathematical
    expressions and terms are apparent but not intelligible.
  20: The model assesses both short-term and long-term relationships between temperature
    and urbanization.
  22: The paper acknowledges the possibility of omitted variable bias and selection
    bias. The paper considers the possibility that some covariates mediate rather
    than confound the relationship between temperature and urbanization, suggesting
    temperature may influence fertility, which in turn affects urbanization.
  23: The paper addresses concerns about omitted variable bias through the inclusion
    of additional controls and replacement of existing controls.
  24: The models control for population size and GDP per capita. Different measures
    of temperature and urbanization are used across the specifications.
  25: The paper finds a positive association between temperature and urbanization
    in the short and long run. Sub-sample analysis suggests that outliers do not drive
    the results. Additional agro-climatic controls do not change the main conclusion.
  26: Further controls include population size; GDP p.c.; democracy; youth dependency
    ratio; education equality. The error correction term is statistically significant
    and negative, indicating convergence to the long-run equilibrium.
  27: IV results are suggestive and face challenges regarding the validity of exclusion
    restrictions.
  28: "The paper uses the share of young males (ages 15\u201329) in relation to all\
    \ working-age males (ages 15\u201364) as an instrument for urbanization. The results\
    \ using this instrument suggest that urbanization does not cause higher temperatures\
    \ in the long run. The conditional effects tests are intended to study how country\
    \ specific factors such as poverty and agriculture dependence affect the temperature-urbanization\
    \ relationship."
  30: The relationship between temperature and urbanization varies depending on factors
    like initial GDP per capita, initial urbanization rates, dependence on agriculture,
    and urban bias.  The paper finds a positive long-run relationship between temperature
    and urbanization in countries with less fortunate starting conditions.
  32: "The provision of public goods is measured using an index of access to public\
    \ services distributed by urban\u2013rural location."
  33: The analysis focuses on rural-urban migration as a response to climate change
    rather than direct macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  34: Policy suggestions include reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing
    public goods access in rural areas to mitigate migration and urbanization pressures.

Quantitative material:
  2: Analyzes 118 countries between 1960 and 2016
  3: No quantitative estimates of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes are given on this
    page.
  12: "The mean temperature (for the countries in the sample) increased by 0.021 \xB0\
    C per year, resulting in a rise from 19.16 \xB0C in 1960 to 20.19 \xB0C in 2016.\
    \ The urbanization rate is estimated to grow by 0.46 percentage points per year,\
    \ increasing from 33.17 in 1960 to 59.07 in 2016."
  13: No relevant information
  16: Higher temperatures are usually associated with lower urbanization levels.
  18: Quantitative figures are present but without clear context or labels, making
    them uninterpretable.
  20: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature is linked to a reduction of the urbanization\
    \ rate by less than 0.03 percentage points in the short run."
  22: "A 1 \xB0C increase in temperature is associated with a long-run increase of\
    \ urbanization by approximately 5.19 percentage points, based on model (3) in\
    \ Table 6. The paper uses examples of Ecuador and Nigeria (1960-2016) to illustrate\
    \ temperature increases and urbanization rates, suggesting a correlation but not\
    \ explicitly quantifying the contribution of temperature to these specific changes."
  23: Higher temperatures are associated with less urbanization in the short run.
    The long-term effect of temperature on urbanization is much more pronounced, where
    higher temperatures are associated with higher levels of urbanization in the long
    run.
  24: The table shows coefficients for the impact of temperature on urbanization.
    For example, in model (1), the coefficient for temperature (MeanUFl) is -0.054
    (0.012)***, meaning a negative relationship between temperature and urbanization.
    There are also other quantitative measures of coefficients in the table.
  25: No relevant information
  26: 'Short-run: A 1-unit increase in temperature is associated with a -0.025 to
    -0.031 change in urbanization. Long-run: Temperature has a positive association
    with urbanization between 5.131 and 6.016; the direction of impact of agro-climatic
    variables on urbanization varies.'
  27: No relevant information.
  28: "A one-unit increase in urbanization (i.e., a 1 percentage point increase in\
    \ the urbanization rate) will increase temperatures by 0.014 \xB0C."
  32: The long-run coefficient associated with temperature becomes smaller once we
    control for the two potential mediator variables (agricultural productivity and
    public goods provision). This reduction in size is also statistically significant.
