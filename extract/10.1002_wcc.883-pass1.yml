Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change risks are mentioned as the driver of the need for adaptation.
  10: Increasing level of global warming intensifies water scarcity.
  11: Global warming intensifying water constraints, leading to reduced water availability
    for irrigation; Risks interconnections related to competing land use priorities
    for ecosystems, crop production, fisheries and mitigation
Highlights:
  1: The paper focuses on adaptation pathways as a way to respond effectively to climate
    change risks.
  2: Adaptation pathways can diverge as global warming increases, leading to radically
    different futures. Adaptation measures for different risks interact, resulting
    in trade-offs. Supporting conditions like collaboration and effective governance
    are needed for successful adaptation implementation.
  10: All options need to be used together to fight water scarcity as global warming
    intensifies; no single option will suffice in the future.
  11: Individual adaptation measures lose effectiveness as global warming intensifies;
    Water availability may be compromised impacting irrigation viability; Trade-offs
    exist between adaptation measures, requiring careful planning; Agricultural land
    abandonment may become the only option in areas with limited water and insufficient
    alternative adaptation strategies
Methodology:
  1: The paper discusses 'Adaptation pathways' as a methodology for responding to
    climate change risks.
  2: Examines adaptation pathways developed for the Europe Chapter of the IPCC AR6,
    using quantitative and qualitative assessment of adaptation effectiveness to inform
    adaptation planning.
  10: The figure presents a qualitative, scenario-based approach to illustrate the
    combination of adaptation measures needed under increasing levels of global warming.
  11: Illustrative pathways representing adaptation strategies
More Notes:
  1: This page is primarily a citation and metadata page, providing limited direct
    information about the study's findings on macroeconomic/fiscal impacts or the
    costs and benefits of adaptation. The full paper would need to be consulted to
    determine its relevance.
  11: Figure 3 illustrates the relationships between adaptation measures, water availability,
    and global warming, but does not provide quantitative estimates of macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes.
No relevant information:
  12: This page does not contain information about specific macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes, quantitative data, or methodology used to determine these outcomes.
    It mainly discusses adaptation pathways, challenges, and considerations for coastal
    and inland flooding, focusing on long-term planning and decision-making processes.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Potentially relevant, as it discusses "effective responses to climate change
    risks," which implies an evaluation of different adaptation options and their
    effects. However, the specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes are not listed
    on this page.
  10: The figure illustrates pathways to fight water scarcity, implying water scarcity
    impacts economic activity and adaptation measures impact this.
  11: Crop production losses
Quantitative material:
  1: No quantitative information is presented on this page.
