Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, uncertainty about climate change, and policy uncertainty related
    to government subsidies for farmers.
  2: Climate change uncertainty and policy uncertainty were key drivers altering farm
    performance, land use, and farm labor.
  5: Climate uncertainty and farm policy uncertainty.
  6: Climate and policy uncertainty.
  7: Climate change and related uncertainty, and policy-related uncertainty, are the
    drivers of risk.
  8: Sub-optimal temperatures, water deficit, and nitrogen deficit impact crop yields.
    Crop management practices, agronomic practices like feed requirements, crop rotations
    and fertilizer needs, and responses of cereals and grass yields to nitrogen fertilizer
    inputs are also considered as factors.

Highlights:
  2: Combination of climate change and policy uncertainty increased mean farm income
    more than scenarios with a single source of uncertainty, though negatively affected
    land use and farm labor compared to the deterministic scenario.
  12: The paper aims to shed light on the impact of climate and policy uncertainty
    on producers, consumers, and the agricultural sector.
  16: Cereals are projected to have an 11% yield increase by 2050, Policy uncertainty
    faced by farmers through subsidy rate changes
  17: Projected climate conditions (2046-2065) generally lead to significantly higher
    yields for timothy grass and spring wheat compared to the baseline (1961-1990),
    although the magnitude of the increase varies across different climate models
    (GCMs) and locations.
  18: Climate uncertainty caused a large variance in cereals production; Policy uncertainty
    had only a minor effect on cereal production; Crop production was more heavily
    affected than animal production; cereals were more sensitive to climate uncertainty
    than grass.
  19: Animal production was far less affected by uncertainty than crop production.
    Milk quotas prevented milk production to increase when payment rates got higher
    or yields increased. Mean meat production was slightly higher in the scenario
    with combined climate uncertainty and policy uncertainty compared to the certainty
    scenario.
  20: Climate and policy uncertainty reinforce each other, affecting meat production,
    with climate uncertainty having a larger impact on white meat due to lower feeding
    costs.
  21: Climate uncertainty and policy uncertainty in combination can reduce agricultural
    area, person-years in agriculture. Policy uncertainty increases the volatility
    of land rents.
  22: Climate and policy uncertainty both increase mean agricultural income per person,
    but climate uncertainty leads to higher income volatility. Social welfare at the
    sector level is relatively stable under all scenarios.
  23: Climate change causes more uncertainty in future farm income than policy changes,
    with increased variance in farm income despite a higher expected average income.
  24: The study did not find clear evidence that climate uncertainty is more important
    than policy uncertainty, even regarding increased income uncertainty for crop
    farmers; domestic market regulation keeps policy uncertainty at a lower level;
    climate change has a positive effect on agricultural crop yields in northern Europe.
  26: Higher sensitivity to climate and policy uncertainty among producers (farmers)
    compared to consumers.
  35: Technical progress is assumed to be 0.25% input savings per annum at the farm
    level and 1.0% at the food industry level.
  41: Climate and policy uncertainties affect land and milk quota rents, with variations
    in mean, minimum, and maximum values compared to a certainty scenario. Policy
    uncertainty appears to have a greater impact on the range of land rents (higher
    standard deviation) than climate uncertainty alone.
  42: Climate and policy uncertainty impact agricultural income and social welfare;
    the mean agricultural income is similar across different uncertainty scenarios
    (421-444), and the mean social welfare is consistent (166).
Methodology:
  1: The study combines policy and climate uncertainty in food production analyses.
  2: The study used weather-driven crop models and a stochastic economic sector model
    to simulate and compare different scenarios of uncertainty on farm profitability
    under emission scenario A1B for 2050.
  5: Agricultural sector models and dynamic crop simulation models are used. Linking
    economic and biogeophysical agricultural models is also discussed.
  6: Combines a crop growth model with a farm sector economic model, including climate
    and policy uncertainty, to determine effects on agricultural production, land
    use, and social welfare.
  7: The study applies two crop simulation models (CSM-CERES-wheat and LINGRA) and
    the Jordmod farm sector model to evaluate the combined effect of climate change
    and policy-related uncertainty on the agricultural sector in Norway until 2050.
  8: The paper uses two crop models (LINGRA and CSM-CERES-wheat) to simulate crop
    yields based on weather and soil data. It also uses Jordmod, a price-endogenous,
    spatial, comparative-static, and partial equilibrium model for the agricultural
    sector in Norway to simulate farm and food industry optimization.
  9: Food industry optimization models minimize total industry costs related to volume
    and regional distribution of raw commodities, transport costs between farms and
    processing plants, and processing costs at the plants. Market module consists
    of 41 final markets. The supply part of the final markets consists of identical
    farms for each type and region, as well as food industry firms, whose number is
    determined in equilibrium. Final demand enters through linear demand functions.
  11: A modelling framework is used to analyze the effect of climate and policy uncertainty
    on crop yields, agricultural production, land use and social welfare, using the
    Jordmod model, the two crop models LINGRA and CSM-CERES-wheat and scenarios and
    data about climate, farm management and policy.
  12: A computational model with five model runs for each scenario, using parameter
    variations at one and three standard deviations from the mean. Uniform probability
    distribution across discrete points is assumed. Scenarios are Climate, Policy,
    and Climate & Policy.
  16: Simulating timothy grass yields for different locations and applying them to
    economic model regions; adjusting Jordmod model with simulated wheat yields; using
    past budget support variations to create a distribution for stochastic direct
    payments, Using CSM-CERES-Wheat model for simulating crop yields, Using Jordmod
    model, which is comparative-static
  17: Crop simulation models (specifically Jordmod) were used to project crop yields
    under different climate scenarios (baseline 1961-1990 and projected 2046-2065).
    Exogenous variables projected to 2030. Technical progress is modelled as an annual
    reduction in input costs independent of changes in yields.

    agricultural production, income and welfare; GCM HADCM3 is used as a source of
    climate data.

    policy ranges and GHG emission scenarios.
  24: The study uses scenarios to investigate the effects of climate and policy uncertainty
    on the agricultural sector. The applicability of the results may extend to a broader
    range of climate projections, at least in northern Europe.
  26: The study followed a cascade approach using output from crop models as input
    in an economic model, with no feedback loop.
  28: Briner et al. (2012) use spatial dynamic modeling to assess the impacts of economic
    and climate changes on land-use in mountain regions.

More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the agricultural sector in Norway.
  5: The study suggests linking models of different scope and scale to study the impact
    of climate change on agricultural ecosystems.
  9: The paper describes agricultural policies and modelling, but there is no explicit
    discussion of climate change impacts or adaptation strategies and their costs/benefits
    on this page.
  12: The climate scenario only considers the direct impact on crop yield, not animal
    production. The policy scenario uses mean yields simulated under climate projections
    for 2046-65.
  16: The analysis focuses on the agricultural sector in Norway.
  19: The analysis seems to focus on the agricultural sector, specifically animal
    and crop production. The paper considers the impact of both climate and policy
    uncertainty, individually and combined.
  20: White meat production is indirectly affected by climate change and has less
    impact from policy uncertainty due to fewer subsidies compared to red meat.
  21: The page focuses on the agricultural sector in Norway. Agricultural area is
    scarce and already highly utilized.
  22: The increase in mean agricultural income per person-year is attributed to a
    decrease in cereal production and a shift to higher-income dairy farming.
  24: The effect of world market price changes on consumers' welfare is expected to
    be small due to high income per capita in Norway.
  26: Suggests shifting from climate-sensitive cereal production to less sensitive
    forage-based animal production.

Quantitative material:
  2: Climate change resulted in on average 9% lower cereal production and unchanged
    grass production.
  17: Simulated crop yields are significantly higher (p<0.05) under projected 2046-2065
    climate conditions compared to the 1961-1990 baseline for both timothy grass and
    spring wheat (with one exception).
  18: Lowest value of cereals production (217,000 t) was about one fifth of the mean
    value, while the highest value was 50 per cent higher than the mean value.
  19: Fodder production accounts for roughly 25 per cent of the total costs of milk
    production.
  20: No specific quantitative information on macroeconomic outcomes is presented
    on this page.
  21: Maximum land rent (6 324 Nkr per ha) was about 3.5 times higher than the minimum
    land rent (1 811 Nkr per ha) in the C&P scenario (combined climate and policy
    uncertainty).
  22: Climate uncertainty and policy uncertainty both increased the mean income to
    a similar extent (per person-year), but volatility was higher under climate uncertainty.
    When both sources of uncertainty were combined, the highest income was about 25
    per cent higher than the lowest income. This difference fell to about 15 (8) per
    cent when climate (policy) uncertainty was concerned. In all three scenarios,
    the highest value of social welfare was at most 3 per cent higher than the lowest
    value.
