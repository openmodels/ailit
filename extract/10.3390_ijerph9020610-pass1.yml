Drivers of Risk:
  1: Human induced climate change will bring further warming over the next century
    at unprecedented rates.
  2: Ethiopia's heavy dependence on rain-fed agriculture, which is sensitive to climate
    change, combined with its low economic development and high population growth
    rate, make it particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts.
  3: Climate change
  6: Climate change impacts on agro-ecosystems/farming systems (climate, topography,
    soils, farming systems) and socio-economic stratification of the agricultural
    sector.
  10: Human-induced land degradation (wind and water erosion), soil constraints (shallow
    soil depth, low fertility, sloping terrain, drainage, leaching, acidity).
  14: Climate change impacts leading to vulnerability in specific agroecosystems.
  15: Low investment rate and population pressure leading to extremely small landholdings.
Highlights:
  1: "Ethiopia\u2019s low level of economic development, combined with its heavy dependence\
    \ on agriculture and high population growth rate make the country particularly\
    \ susceptible to the adverse effects of climate change."
  2: Ethiopia's climate change impacts include increased frequency and intensity of
    droughts and floods, affecting livelihoods and increasing household vulnerability.
  6: Building a climate resilient economy involves adapting to climate change to minimize
    damage and maximize benefits; resilience is linked to adaptive capacity, which
    varies based on access to resources.
  10: AES 1 and AES 5 are characterized by fragmented and steep slopes with the highest
    degradation rate; AES 3 is the most suitable land for agriculture; vulnerability
    is hypothesized to increase with an increase in crop suitability.
  14: Low adaptive capacity in certain agroecosystems (AES 5 and 1) makes them vulnerable
    to climate change; Limited participation by local communities in climate change
    adaptation efforts, especially in monitoring and evaluation; Training, frequency
    of extension worker visits, farmer perception of benefits, and farmer perception
    of responsibility positively influence participation; Community-based projects
    increase community participation in natural resources governance.

Methodology:
  6: Agro-ecosystem analysis considering geographical differentiation and socio-economic
    stratification; classification of agroecosystems to support agricultural policy
    makers and development experts.
  10: The analysis uses FAO data on human-induced land degradation and assesses land
    suitability based on soil characteristics.
  14: Participation index analysis of farmers' involvement in watershed management
    activities; Regression analysis to identify factors influencing farmer participation;
    Evaluation of a 5-step planning tool for Local-Level Environment Action-Plan Development.

More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on building climate resilience in the Blue Nile/Abay Highlands
    of Ethiopia. A framework for enhancing climate resilience is proposed based on
    a five-year study in the Choke Mountain area.
  3: The paper primarily focuses on building resilience to climate change at a local
    level in the Blue Nile/Abay Highlands and introduces a Community-based Ecosystem
    Approach.
  6: The analysis focuses on the Choke Mountain Watersheds in East Gojjam, Amhara
    National Regional State, Ethiopia, and identifies six major agroecosystems (AES).
  10: The study area is the Choke Mountain watersheds. The paper focuses on household
    vulnerability related to agriculture, not macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes
    at a national level. The information provided is localized and may not be generalizable
    to a national scale without further analysis and aggregation.
  14: The study emphasizes the importance of 'soft technologies' like knowledge and
    organizational capacity, in addition to 'hard technologies' for successful adaptation.
  15: This page focuses on the Choke Mountain Watersheds in Ethiopia and discusses
    opportunities and challenges for climate resilient economies at a local level,
    but does not present nationwide macroeconomic or fiscal analysis.

Quantitative material:
  3: "Climate change will reduce Ethiopia\u2019s GDP growth by between 0.5 and 2.5%\
    \ each year (World Bank projection)."
  10: Suitability scores for agroecosystems (AES1-AES6) ranging from 1 to 5, and land
    degradation levels for agroecosystems (AES1-AES6) ranging from 1 to 5.
  14: 96.4% of farmers participated in fewer than 60% of intended watershed management
    activities; Over half of the farmers participated in fewer than 40% percent of
    intended activities; 51% of respondents participated in planning, 43% in implementation,
    and 1% in monitoring and evaluation phases of the intervention; 21 farming communities
    were provided with about 25,000 USD each for local environmental action plans.
