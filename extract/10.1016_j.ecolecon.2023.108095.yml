Drivers of Risk:
  1: Drought, measured using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index.
  7: Drier conditions during the growing season can lower the demand for land ownership.
  8: Drought conditions and above-average precipitation levels.
  14: SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, current), poverty
    status, gender of household head, farm size.
  16: SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) at current, lag 1,
    and lag 2 periods; Categorical SPEI measures of dry, wet, and normal conditions
    at current, lag 1, and lag 2 periods
  17: SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) at current, lag 1,
    and lag 2 periods, categorized as Dry, Wet, or Normal
Highlights:
  1: Drought exposure limits the operating space for farmers wishing to purchase land
    in Uganda. Effects persist over time and are robust to different specifications.
  7: Owner-cum-users, who have both use and ownership rights to land, tend to have
    younger, better-educated household heads and are more likely to be male.
  8: Drought persistently lowers demand for land ownership; increased precipitation
    raises demand, supporting the hypothesis that agricultural prospects drive land
    value perceptions.
  14: SPEI has a statistically significant positive effect on willingness to acquire
    land ownership rights. This effect is heterogeneous depending on poverty status,
    gender, and farm size, though interactions may or may not be significant.
  16: Current and lagged SPEI significantly affects households' willingness to purchase
    land and the amount they are willing to pay; specifically, dry spells are associated
    with lower willingness to purchase land and amount households are willing to pay,
    while wet spells have positive effects.
  17: Lagged SPEI variables, particularly Lag 1 and Lag 2, are often statistically
    significant predictors of both willingness to purchase land and the amount households
    are willing to pay. Negative coefficients for 'Dry' SPEI categories indicate that
    drought conditions negatively affect willingness to purchase and the amount households
    are willing to pay.
Methodology:
  1: Household fixed effects approach using three waves of the Uganda National Panel
    Survey combined with an indicator for drought.
  7: The analysis estimates the effect of exposure to drought on willingness to acquire
    land ownership using linear probability models with inverse hyperbolic sine transformation
    and OLS estimation.
  8: Analysis performed using OLS regression with continuous and categorical SPEI
    measures, based on data from UNPS, CHIRPS, and CHIRTS, and focused on willingness
    to pay for land ownership.
  14: Estimated with OLS, with standard errors clustered at the district level and
    attrition weights applied. Household FE, Wave FE, and Month FE are included. Data
    from UNPS (waves 2005/06, 2009/10, and 2010/11), CHIRPS for precipitation, and
    CHIRTS for temperature.
  16: OLS regression, Probit model with bias correction for fixed effects, and Poisson
    quasi-maximum likelihood models are used to estimate the relationships between
    SPEI and the outcomes of interest, with household, wave, and month fixed effects.
    The analysis is performed using UNPS data from 2005/06, 2009/10, and 2010/11,
    along with CHIRPS precipitation and CHIRTS temperature data.
  17: Probit and Tobit correlated random effects models are used. Data spans UNPS
    waves 2005/06, 2009/10, and 2010/11, with precipitation data from CHIRPS and temperature
    data from CHIRTS. Models 1-4 are probit, models 5-8 are tobit.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the context of Uganda, where many households hold use rights
    to land and face the decision of whether to acquire full ownership rights.
  7: Households with use rights but not full ownership have smaller farms, more fragmented
    land, and face longer distances to their parcels.
  16: Robustness tests were performed by including third lags of SPEI and lead SPEI,
    excluding Mailo land, and using Probit and Poisson models, and models are controlled
    for household fixed effects and other time-related fixed effects.
  17: The analysis includes both 'within' and 'between' effects of SPEI, potentially
    capturing short-term and long-term impacts, respectively. Time-invariant household
    controls are included in all models. The dependent variables here are at the household
    level, not nation-wide.

  11: The provided tables focus on household-level data and determinants of panel
    survey participation in Uganda (UNPS). They do not directly address macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal risks of climate change or the costs and benefits of national-level
    adaptation. The focus is on land ownership, household characteristics, and survey
    methodology.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Households' willingness to acquire land ownership rights and the price households
    are willing to pay for land.
  7: No relevant information
  8: Drought conditions lower the willingness of households to acquire full ownership
    rights for land, suggesting a potential impact on land-related economic activities.
  14: No relevant information
  16: Willingness to purchase land, Amount households are willing to pay
  17: Willingness to purchase land; Amount households are willing to pay
Quantitative Material:
  8: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes quantified on this page.
Quantitative material:
  1: Exposure to drought lowers households' intentions to purchase land and substantially
    reduces the price households are willing to pay for land.
  7: Exposure to drier conditions has a statistically significant negative impact
    on the demand for land ownership at the 5% level.
  14: The table shows coefficient estimates for the impact of SPEI and its interactions
    with poverty status, gender of household head, and farm size on the willingness
    to acquire land ownership rights. R-squared values are also presented.
  16: The tables report regression coefficients, standard errors, R-squared values,
    and sample sizes (N) associated with the impact of SPEI on the willingness to
    purchase land and the amount households are willing to pay.
  17: Coefficients, standard errors, and significance levels (*p < 0.10, **p < 0.05,
    ***p < 0.01) are provided for each SPEI variable and its impact on the dependent
