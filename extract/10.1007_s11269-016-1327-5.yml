  4: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased water demands and the impacts of climate change
  4: Water demands (agricultural, industrial, and domestic water abstractions); Regulatory
    constraints linked to environmental flow requirements; Increased infiltration
    and reduced runoff due to pumping activities; Climate variability leading to dry
    years.
  6: Climate forcings (IPSL-CM5A-LR coupled Global Circulation Model using the RCP6.0
    climate scenario), socio-economic factors based on the Shared Socio-economic Pathways
    (SSP2) scenario, and drawdowns impacting well yield and increased surface water.
Highlights:
  1: Developed a modelling capacity for rapidly generating scenario-based water availability
    projections with operational relevance in a rigorous, systematic way.
Methodology:
  1: Computed Operational Freshwater Availability (OFWA) using the PCR-GLOBWB global
    hydrology and water resources model, coupled to a global MODFLOW groundwater model.
    Forced with rainfall and temperature fields from the IPSL-CM5A-LR climate model
    under the RCP6.0 climate scenario, with water demands based on the SSP2 socio-economic
    scenario. Downscaling to 90 m resolution.
  4: The paper defines and analyzes operational surface water availability (OSWA)
    as river runoff (considering existing water demands) minus environmental flow
    requirements. A PCR-GLOBWB run is used to determine pristine river runoff, and
    the difference between pristine runoff and actual runoff represents net water
    consumption. The impact of groundwater pumping on river runoff is also considered.
  6: The study uses the PCR-GLOBWB hydrological model coupled with MODFLOW-based GGWM
    to simulate water storages and fluxes. It uses ERA-Interim_GPCP data for calibration
    (1980-2010) and IPSL-CM5A-LR/RCP6.0 for future scenarios (1980-2065). Water demands
    are driven by SSP2. Steady-state groundwater model imported into iMOD software,
    converted to transient, using recharge and surface water elevations from PCR-GLOBWB.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on freshwater availability as a key resource impacted by climate
    change and increased demand, which has implications for broader economic activity.
  4: The analysis focuses on water availability at the asset level, assuming water
    within a defined window is accessible. Artificial redistribution networks like
    canals are not considered due to the difficulty in globally mapping them.
  13: This paper focuses on hydrological modeling and freshwater availability. It
    does not directly address macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes of climate change or
    adaptation at a national level. However, it provides a tool to assess water availability,
    which can be an input to economic models.
