Drivers of Risk:
  2: Uncertainty regarding future climate conditions creates an option value of delaying
    efforts, increasing agency costs.
  3: Climate change hazards and scientific uncertainty regarding future climate conditions,
    potentially causing significant implications for infrastructure investments and
    maintenance.
  4: Anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) concentration leading to extreme events
    like heat waves, floodings, and precipitations; uncertainty in future environmental
    parameters due to climate change; variations in average temperature conditions
    and precipitations.
  6: Uncertainty on climate shocks, initial uncertainty over future productivity shocks,
    irreversibility of investments.
  7: Environmental shocks, productivity shocks, uncertainty on climate change
  8: The success of the initial investment (infrastructure design) is uncertain, with
    probability e1, where e1 is the firm's effort.
  9: "Uncertain climate shocks (parameter \u03B8, a productivity shock linked to climate\
    \ change)."
  12: "Productivity shock (\u03B8) in the second period."
  13: "Productivity shock (\u03B8); Principal's discount factor (\u03B4); Agency costs\
    \ (mentioned but not elaborated on this page)."
  24: "Productivity shocks (\u03B8)"
  25: "Climate shocks (represented by \u03B8), choice of technology (\u03B1)"
  28: Climate change related hazards, climate uncertainty, and the resulting agency
    costs associated with delegated flexibility in long-term contracts.
  29: Climate hazards putting long-lived assets at risk; governments reneging on long-term
    contracts due to political or fiscal pressures; financial and regulatory constraints
    impacting investments and adoption of new technologies.

Highlights:
  2: Climate change sheds a pessimistic light on the relevance of Public-Private Partnerships
    (PPPs) in infrastructure sectors sensitive to changing weather conditions.
  3: The paper argues that long-term contracting is plagued with new agency costs
    of delegated flexibility due to climate change, potentially making PPPs less beneficial.
  4: Climate change poses risks to infrastructure investments due to the long lifespan
    of infrastructure and the increasing rate of climate change; developing countries
    are more vulnerable due to large-scale infrastructure needs and stronger climate
    change impacts; infrastructure is sensitive to climate hazards like changes in
    precipitations, rivers, and glacial runoffs.
  6: Uncertainty on climate changes makes it impossible to write long-term contracts,
    exacerbating the agency problem between the public and private sectors. Firms
    have incentives to underinvest in the earlier period to maintain flexibility for
    the future. A lower first-period effort affects agency costs in both periods (Commitment
    Effect) and affects the sensitivity of the second-period effort to incentives
    (Flexibility Effect).
  7: Commitment to unbundle project stages between firms prevents perverse incentives
    for flexibility. Keeping contracts incomplete and short-term can improve outcomes.
    Adopting a more costly technology might be optimal if it improves flexibility
    against environmental shocks.
  12: The optimal level of effort in the first period (ei1) is less than the effort
    level in a setting without consideration for the productivity shock.
  13: A less myopic principal (lower discount factor) reduces their first-period investment
    to maintain flexibility, delaying effort provision until the productivity shock
    is known.
  20: "Non-stationary policies, where incentives change over time, can be attractive\
    \ because they allow the principal to balance commitment and flexibility. Decreasing\
    \ incentives over time (\u03B3 < 1) might be suitable for projects like BOT, while\
    \ increasing incentives (\u03B3 > 1) might be suitable for BOO. The optimal contract\
    \ depends on the elasticity of effort supply; if elasticity is non-decreasing,\
    \ then \u03B3 \u2265 1, and if it is non-increasing, then \u03B3 \u2264 1."
  24: Efforts are reduced to reduce the firm's rent when compared with the scenario
    in Section 3.1; the principal is able to better control the agent with short-term
    contracts.
  25: "Choosing less costly technologies (lower \u03B1) exacerbates the impact of\
    \ climate shocks on productivity. Investing more ex ante in safer technologies\
    \ ensures that random productivity shocks will be closer to the mean scenario."
  28: Climate uncertainty can negatively impact the long-run viability of PPPs, especially
    in water and energy production, due to decreasing incentives over time. Short-term
    contracts, unbundling of tasks, and flexible technologies can help reduce the
    agency costs of delegated flexibility.
  29: Climate hazards can impact growth rates by affecting contracts and investments
    in infrastructure sectors.

Methodology:
  2: Principal-agent context with dynamic moral hazard, limited liability, and irreversibility
    constraints.
  3: The paper uses a model of long-term contracting to analyze PPP suitability in
    coping with climate change-related uncertainty.
  6: The paper uses an agency model to analyze the relationship between the public
    sector and private firms in the context of climate change adaptation, considering
    different scenarios of contractual incompleteness. It incorporates the option
    value of waiting and the irreversibility of investments.
  7: Theoretical model analyzing incentives in agency contexts, comparing different
    organizational and technological choices
  8: The analysis uses a two-stage public-private partnership (PPP) model to analyze
    the relationship between a government and a private firm for the provision of
    a public service. The model considers an initial investment period and a follow-up
    investment or maintenance period.
  9: A two-period model with an agent performing complementary investment or maintenance
    in the second period; the model incorporates irreversibility of the first-period
    investment and uncertainty on climate shocks.
  12: The paper develops a model where a government invests in adaptation efforts
    in two periods. The model compares optimal flexibility with agency costs to a
    benchmark without agency costs, and it recaps basic results from the irreversibility
    literature.
  13: Analytical model of a principal-agent relationship over two periods with a productivity
    shock. The model examines the principal's investment/effort decision in the first
    period, considering flexibility motives.
  19: The paper uses a principal-agent model with two periods and an irreversibility
    constraint. The analysis focuses on the trade-off between commitment and flexibility
    in the context of incentivizing the agent.
  20: "The paper analyzes long-term contracts (specifically PPPs) between a principal\
    \ and an agent, focusing on how incentives can be structured over time (stationary\
    \ vs. non-stationary) and the implications for investment and project success.\
    \ It uses a model where the principal's objective function is quasi-concave in\
    \ (t2, \u03B3), where \u03B3 = t2/t1 represents the ratio of second-period to\
    \ first-period incentives."
  24: Economic modeling with a principal-agent framework, short-term contracts, and
    consideration of unforeseen climate contingencies.
  25: "Theoretical model of technology choice under climate uncertainty, focusing\
    \ on long-lived infrastructure projects. Assumes a continuum of technologies indexed\
    \ by \u03B1, where higher \u03B1 implies lower exposure to climate hazards but\
    \ higher upfront cost. Analysis is restricted to stationary contracts (t1 = t2\
    \ = t), though similar insights would apply in less incomplete environments."
  28: Theoretical analysis of how climate uncertainty affects long-term contractual
    relationships like PPPs, focusing on agency costs and the elasticity of effort
    supply. The analysis considers the optimal design of institutional, contractual,
    and technological constraints.
  29: Normative approach to the problem of delegated flexibility.
  41: The analysis involves integration by parts and relies on Proposition 6 and condition
    (31).
More Notes:
  2: The analysis is relevant for infrastructure sectors sensitive to changing weather
    conditions.
  4: Climate risk assessments are limited by the coarse spatial resolution of climate
    models and the lack of clear understanding of how global climate change translates
    at the local level.
  7: Suggests a possible substitutability between contractual and technological choices.
  8: "The model incorporates a discount factor (delta) and the cost of effort for\
    \ the agent, represented by the function \u03C8(e1)."
  9: "The paper analyzes the agent's effort supply and its elasticity, which depend\
    \ on the marginal disutility of effort. An intertemporal irreversibility constraint\
    \ (e2 \u2265 e1) is introduced."
  12: The model considers a principal (government) maximizing intertemporal payoff
    by choosing effort levels in two periods. The second-period effort is constrained
    by the first-period commitment if the productivity shock is sufficiently adverse.
  13: "The threshold value of the productivity shock (\u03B6(\u03B4,1)) below which\
    \ an earlier commitment is binding is below the mean (E\u03B8(\u03B8)), indicating\
    \ a bias towards flexibility. As the discount factor (\u03B4) increases, the threshold\
    \ (\u03B6(\u03B4,1)) decreases, and the principal underinvests more."
  19: The model explores how delegated incentives for flexibility affect the intertemporal
    distribution of rents and the firm's responsiveness to incentives over time.
  24: The results under short-term contracts are the same under unbundling scenarios
    when the principal can commit upfront to offer a second-period reward that depends
    on the productivity shocks, but that assumes climate contingencies are perfectly
    foreseen.
  25: The model explores the trade-off between upfront investment in climate-resilient
    technology and the subsequent risk of productivity losses due to climate shocks.
    The analysis focuses on the impact of technological choice on the incentive compatibility
    constraint of a firm.
  29: The paper suggests extending the framework to account for evolving preferences
    of the government and possible renegotiation of its objectives. Future research
    intends to explore the consequences of the intriguing channel between climate
    and growth.

  15: This page focuses on a microeconomic model of a firm's investment decisions
    under uncertainty, with no direct connection to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes
    related to climate change adaptation at a national level.
  17: This page focuses on a theoretical model of optimal contracts under uncertainty
    and does not provide specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes related to climate
    change adaptation at a national level. The model deals with the design of contracts
    when it is difficult to distinguish between different climate conditions, which
    is not the same as quantifying adaptation costs or benefits.
