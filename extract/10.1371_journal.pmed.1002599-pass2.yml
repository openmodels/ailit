Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, increased air conditioning use, power sector emissions.
  2: Climate change leading to increased temperatures, increased air conditioning
    demand, increased power sector emissions.
  3: Climate change leading to increased cooling demand and subsequent emissions from
    power plants.
  4: Increased air conditioning use leading to higher electricity demand, primarily
    from fossil fuels, increasing harmful emissions.
  5: Climate change (specifically a warm mid-century summer climate), heat-driven
    changes in emissions from the electricity sector, ground-level ozone and PM2.5
    levels, and demographic trends increasing vulnerability to air pollution exposure.
  10: Climate change leading to increased cooling demand, exacerbated pollution (PM2.5
    and O3), and warmer temperatures.
  12: "A 3.5\xB0C warmer summer increases building energy demand for air conditioning,\
    \ which in turn drives increases in electricity production and associated emissions."
  13: Climate change adaptation of cooling demand, leading to changes in power plant
    emissions.
  14: Climate change leading to increased cooling demand, resulting in greater emissions
    of NOx and SO2 associated with higher electricity demand; Biogenic emissions enhanced
    under a warmer climate.
  17: Climate change impacts on cooling demand, leading to changes in PM2.5 and Ozone
    concentrations.
  19: Adaptation actions are impacting mortality and morbidity due to increased cooling
    demand affecting air quality.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change increases PM2.5 concentrations, worsened by increased air conditioning.
  2: Approximately 5%-9% of exacerbated air-pollution-related mortality will be due
    to increases in power sector emissions from heat-driven building electricity demand.
  3: Increased air conditioning exacerbates climate-change-related air quality, leading
    to increased health damages with significant economic costs (billions of dollars).
  4: Increased demand for air conditioning could amplify NO2, SO2, and CO2 emissions;
    adaptation measures like green buildings can avoid adverse health effects.
  5: The study compares the impact of mid-century climate change on air quality with
    and without associated heat-driven changes in emissions from the electricity sector.
    It characterizes health co-benefits from mitigation strategies and quantifies
    health damages from air pollution in a future climate.
  10: Adaptation through air conditioning use constitutes a positive climate feedback
    by increasing electricity demand and associated emissions. Future electricity
    generation is projected to shift towards natural gas plants, mitigating CO2 emission
    increases compared to electricity production increases.
  12: "Increased air conditioning use as an adaptation response to climate change\
    \ in the eastern US leads to significant increases in emissions (CO2, NO\u2093\
    , SO\u2082) and air pollutants (PM2.5, O3), partially offsetting the intended\
    \ benefits of adaptation by worsening air quality."
  13: Climate adaptation measures involving cooling demand can lead to changes in
    ambient air pollution (PM2.5 and O3). Some regions experience increased pollution
    due to greater emissions from electricity generating units (EGUs), while others
    see a small decrease, potentially from changes in power plant dispatch.
  14: Climate change and adaptation (increased air conditioning use) lead to increases
    in PM2.5 and ozone concentrations, primarily due to increased emissions of NOx
    and SO2 from power plants and biogenic emissions. The increases in SO2 and NOx
    are associated with electricity generation to meet increased cooling demand.
  17: Climate change impacts on building energy use may lead to significant increases
    in air-pollution related mortality and associated economic costs, despite adaptation
    efforts.
  19: Adaptation measures contribute to 8.7% additional premature deaths above climate
    change impacts alone, mainly through increased air pollution mortality.
Methodology:
  1: Interdisciplinary linked model system including WRF, RBESS, MyPower, CMAQ, and
    BenMAP; Simulations for present-day and mid-century climates with and without
    adaptation in building energy use.
  2: Health impacts assessment using concentration-response functions based on July
    modeling. The study examines the contribution of future air-pollution-related
    health damages that are caused by the power sector through heat-driven air conditioning
    adaptation in buildings. Single month modeling and one model-year of future climate
    simulations, not a projection.
  3: Computer models were used to calculate air pollution and health impacts with
    and without greater use of air conditioning, in a warmer climate.
  4: Novel interdisciplinary modeling effort to quantify air pollution and health
    impacts related to climate change adaptation via air conditioning.
  5: A system of linked numerical models is used to assess changes in building energy
    demand, electricity production, power sector emissions, air quality, and human
    health outcomes. The models include RBESS, MyPower, and CMAQ, with health impacts
    evaluated using BenMAP. Simulations are performed for present-day conditions,
    a mid-century climate with 2001 power sector emissions, and a mid-century climate
    with 2069 power sector emissions (adaptation scenario). The analysis focuses on
    the eastern US.
  10: Calculates air quality health impacts using willingness to pay and cost of illness
    methods applied to calculated pollution incidences. Annual impacts are estimated
    by tripling July modeling results to represent a 3-month summer average. Health
    impact functions are based on annual average air pollution calculated from daily
    mean values with changes only in July.
  12: The study compares present-day (PD) climate and emissions to mid-century climate
    (MCCO) and mid-century climate with adaptation (MCA) scenarios, analyzing air
    quality (PM2.5 and O3) changes due to building energy use using regional averages.
    Histograms are used to show the distributions of hourly electricity production
    and emissions. The time horizon is mid-century.
  13: Comparison of a warm mid-century climate-only scenario (MCCO) to a warm mid-century
    adaptation scenario (MCA).
  14: Atmospheric modeling is used to simulate air quality changes under future climate
    scenarios, considering climate change alone (MCCO) and with adaptation measures
    like air conditioning (MCA). The model considers biogenic emissions and building
    energy use. State-by-state variations are analyzed (Fig 5).
  17: The analysis uses concentration-response (C-R) functions from various expert
    elicitations and epidemiological studies to estimate mortality incidence and associated
    economic valuation. It compares scenarios of mid-century climate-only impacts
    (MCCO) with mid-century adaptation (MCA) to assess the health impacts of building
    energy use on PM2.5 and Ozone.
More Notes:
  1: Focuses on air quality and health impacts related to cooling demand in the Eastern
    United States.
  2: The study models air quality impacts with adaptation in cooling demand. Adaptive
    behavior (extra air conditioning use) is attributable to 3.8% of the total increase
    in PM2.5 and 6.7% of the total increase in O3.
  3: The analysis highlights the need for cleaner energy sources, energy efficiency,
    and energy conservation to mitigate the health impacts of increased cooling demand.
  5: The study builds upon epidemiological work relating air pollution and human health,
    including studies utilized in the EPA's BenMAP program. The figure provides a
    visual representation of the modeling system and its components.
  10: The analysis focuses on the incremental impact of adaptation. Modeling is conducted
    for July and scaled to represent summer averages, although this is likely a conservative
    estimate.  The paper presents mortality results in the main text and morbidity
    results in supplementary tables. Justification for modeling only July is due to
    computational demands and the exploratory nature of the study.
  12: The study focuses on the impact of increased air conditioning on air quality,
    not a full cost-benefit analysis of adaptation. The study suggests that adaptation
    measures can have unintended consequences that should be considered.
  14: The study acknowledges potential errors in the CB05 mechanism within the CMAQ
    model regarding the representation of secondary organic aerosol formation. The
    discussion focuses on changes due to building energy use (MCCO versus MCA). The
    impact of climate change alone on PM2.5 is notable but not the primary focus.
  17: The analysis is focused on the health impacts of projected mid-century building
    energy use on PM2.5 and Ozone. Different concentration-response functions and
    age ranges were used for different mortality estimations.
  19: The independent health impacts from exposure to PM2.5 and O3 can't be directly
    summed due to non-accounted interaction effects.

    \ through air conditioning increases minimum and maximum values to 4.48 \u03BC\
