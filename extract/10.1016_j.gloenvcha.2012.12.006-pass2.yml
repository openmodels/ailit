  3: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  8: Precipitation increase in winter, precipitation decrease in summer, sea level
    increase (35-85 cm in 2100), population change (12 million or 24 million in 2100),
    changes in agricultural land use, increased water demands, more salt intrusion,
    lower river discharges, higher river discharges, and population and economic growth.
  10: Climate change scenarios (Warm, Crowd) leading to water scarcity and salt intrusion
    impacting agriculture and water management.
Highlights:
  4: The analysis allows for comparison of different adaptation pathways based on
    their relative costs, target achievement, and side effects.
  5: The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach aims to provide a framework for
    decision-making under uncertainty by combining the strengths of Adaptive Policymaking
    and Adaptation Pathways. It emphasizes the importance of considering transient
    scenarios, identifying adaptation tipping points ('sell-by dates'), and dynamically
    adjusting plans based on monitoring and contingency actions.
  8: The current plan is likely to be sufficient for achieving objectives for approximately
    30 years. Improvements that can be made to the current system should enable the
    sell-by date to be extended by approximately 10 years.
  10: Identifies socially robust adaptation actions that can be agreed upon by different
    perspectives. Highlights the importance of contingency actions, signposts, and
    triggers to stay on the track of a pathway.
Methodology:
  4: The paper uses an Adaptation Pathways map and a scorecard to present the costs
    and benefits of different adaptation pathways. The Adaptation Pathways map visualizes
    different adaptation actions and their effectiveness under various scenarios over
    time.
  5: 'This paper compares two adaptation planning approaches: Adaptive Policymaking
    and Adaptation Pathways. It then introduces a combined approach called Dynamic
    Adaptive Policy Pathways, which integrates the strengths of both. This integrated
    approach uses transient scenarios to represent relevant uncertainties and their
    development over time. It provides insight into the sequencing of actions, identifies
    vulnerabilities and opportunities, and includes a monitoring system with related
    contingency actions.'
  8: Expert knowledge, previous studies, and preliminary modeling results for 2050
    and 2100 indicating how much water (in cm IJsselmeer lake level) is needed to
    supply the amount of water demanded for an average, dry, and extremely dry year
    for the different scenarios. A linear change of climate and socio-economic developments
    is assumed for determining the sell-by date.
  10: Uses adaptation pathways mapping to explore different adaptation strategies
    based on different perspectives (Hierarchist, Egalitarian, Individualist). Applicable
    for the Netherlands in 2050 and 2100.
More Notes:
  4: The approach emphasizes dynamic adaptive planning, allowing for adjustments to
    adaptation strategies based on monitoring and changing conditions.
  5: The paper focuses on the process of designing adaptation plans and doesn't provide
    specific quantitative assessments of macroeconomic or fiscal impacts of climate
    change or adaptation measures. The flowchart outlines a 10-step process for developing
    dynamic adaptive policy pathways, emphasizing the iterative nature of adaptation
    planning and the need for continuous monitoring and adjustment.
  8: The analysis focuses on the IJsselmeer area in the Netherlands as an illustrative
    example. The flood management actions and the actions for fresh water supply influence
    each other. Actions in the IJsselmeer area are related to other regions in the
    lower Rhine Delta.
  10: The analysis focuses on water management in the Netherlands under climate change
    scenarios, considering different perspectives on adaptation.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  8: Impacts on safety, fresh water capacity, side impacts on nature areas and shipping.
  10: Mentions adaptation pathways related to water management and crop adaptation,
    but does not provide specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
Quantitative material:
  8: Sea level increase (35-85 cm in 2100), population change (12 million or 24 million
    in 2100), Sell-by date (years) of actions, Costs (qualitative scale).
