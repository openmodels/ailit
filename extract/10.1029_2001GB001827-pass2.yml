Drivers of Risk:
  7: Climate change impacts (specifically changes in temperature, precipitation, etc.,
    but separated from the impact of CO2 fertilization)
  11: Climate change impacts, especially temperature and precipitation changes, on
    terrestrial carbon uptake and storage.
Highlights:
  7: Climate change alone (without CO2 fertilization) has a significant negative impact
    on net primary productivity (NPP) and the terrestrial carbon pool, particularly
    in the tropics. The impact on NEP is less strong in Northern Hemisphere middle
    and high latitudes, with some ecosystems showing an increase while others show
    a decrease.
  11: Tropical ecosystems, strongly affected by drought stress, contribute significantly
    to decrease in carbon storage; potential increase in atmospheric CO2 by 78 ppmv
    by 2100 due to reduced carbon uptake.
Methodology:
  11: Coupled climate-carbon model simulations based on an IPCC SRES-A2 scenario,
    analyzing impacts on land biosphere to 2100.
More Notes:
  7: The analysis isolates the impact of climate change on the terrestrial biosphere
    by controlling for the effects of increased atmospheric CO2.
No relevant information:
  9: This page focuses on the impact of climate change on Net Primary Production (NPP)
    across various global ecosystems, rather than on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes
    at a national level. The analysis is ecological, not economic.
  12: No relevant information
  14: This page primarily discusses climate-carbon cycle feedbacks and land biosphere
    responses to climate change, and does not include specific macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes or adaptation cost-benefit analyses at the national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  7: No relevant information
  11: No direct macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes provided; the focus is on terrestrial
    carbon uptake and storage.
Quantitative material:
  7: Climate Impact run projects an increase of terrestrial carbon pool of 412 Gt
    C by 2100, compared to 640 Gt C in the Fertilization run. NEP only amounts to
    2.9 Gt C yr/C0 in the Climate Impact run, compared to 7.7 Gt C yr/C0 in the Fertilization
    run.
  11: Climate change drives a reduction of 228 Gt C in global carbon uptake, offset
    partially by 53 Gt C from CO2 fertilization effects.
