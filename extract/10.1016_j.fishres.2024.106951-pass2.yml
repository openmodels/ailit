Drivers of Risk:
  2: Environmental variables (temperature, ocean pH) impacting population parameters
    (recruitment, growth) and future climate conditions based on Earth System Models/emission
    scenarios.
  3: Environmental variables and future climate scenarios are key drivers of risk,
    specifically related to sea ice in the Bering Sea, based on downscaled Earth System
    Models and emission scenarios.
  4: Environmental variables are linked to time-varying parameters in the model, and
    Earth System Models/emission scenarios are used to project these environmental
    variables, which influence the catch series.
  5: Sea surface temperature (SST) in summer, sea surface or bottom temperature during
    the spawning season, ocean pH during the spawning season affect Pacific Cod.
  7: Summer bottom temperature, Summer surface temperature, Spring bottom temperature,
    Spring surface temperature, Spring bottom pH, Spring surface pH; specifically
    summer sea surface temperature (SST).
  8: Summer sea surface temperature changes are highlighted as a key environmental
    driver affecting recruitment and biomass projections.
  9: Summer sea surface temperature (SST), different environmental scenarios (ssp126,
    ssp585), catch limits based on different control rules (threshold, constant F).
  10: Temperature increases are projected to lead to lower recruitment but higher
    weight-at-age for Pacific cod. The negative impacts on recruitment outweigh the
    positive effects on weight-at-age.
  11: Changes in environmental variables determining growth and recruitment, natural
    mortality due to trophic interactions, different climate scenarios (SSP126 and
    SSP585) affecting spring onset.
  12: Summer SST impacts on growth and recruitment are key drivers. Different Earth
    System Models (MIROC ssp126 and GFDL ssp585) and emission scenarios drive variations
    in catch limits and thus, spawning biomass.
  13: Warming changes in the eastern Bering Sea are a driver of risk.
  14: The drivers of risk include temperature and pH on growth and recruitment of
    Pacific cod. Increased temperature is associated with increased metabolic demand
    and mortality, and decreased availability and energy content of prey. Future environmental-
    and climate-driven dynamics also contribute.
  15: Environmental variables, which are proxies for the actual mechanisms driving
    the population dynamics, are impacting the outcomes.
  16: Climate warming and basing catch limits on certain environmental models could
    lead to population crashes.
  17: Mentions climate change, ocean acidification, temperature, and environmental
    data as factors impacting fish stocks and ecosystems.
Evaluation overview:
  2: Evaluates consequences of catch limits based on specific assessment model configurations,
    Earth System Models, and harvest control rules when these assumptions may be incorrect.
  3: The paper evaluates the uncertainty in stock assessments and future catch time-series
    for fisheries management under climate change, considering different model configurations,
    environmental variables, and harvest control rules.
  5: The study evaluates drivers of population parameters for Pacific cod in the eastern
    Bering Sea.
  7: Evaluates future catch size, conservation-related performance metrics (probability
    of spawning biomass dropping below 20% of unfished levels, probability of a 50%
    decline in abundance), and economic performance metrics (average catch, profit
    ratios, and variation in catch).
  8: Evaluates the projected impact of environmental variables on Pacific cod spawning
    biomass in the eastern Bering Sea.
  9: Consequences of future climate impacts on cod in the north Pacific, specifically
    examining impacts on growth, recruitment, and ultimately, spawning biomass and
    profits.
  10: This paper evaluates the projected spawning biomass and catch of Pacific cod
    under different climate scenarios.
  11: Impact of different climate scenarios and assessment model configurations on
    fisheries management (specifically Pacific cod in the Gulf of Alaska).
  12: The study evaluates the impact of environmental scenarios, specifically summer
    sea surface temperature (SST), on spawning biomass of a fish stock.
  13: "Spawning biomass is evaluated as a function of environmental variables and\
    \ population parameters determined over the period 1977\u20132022."
  14: The study evaluates the probability of spawning biomass dropping below four
    threshold levels and the distribution for the relative profit for catch time-series.
  15: Effects of thermal stress on groundfish populations are being evaluated.
  16: The paper indicates declines in biomass and catch for EBS Pacific cod with future
    levels of climate warming.
  17: The page primarily focuses on fisheries management, stock assessments, and ecosystem-based
    approaches.
Highlights:
  2: Inclusion of environmental variables does not markedly impact main assessment
    outputs (spawning biomass, recruitment) due to the strong influence of monitoring
    data, but future population state is directly related to assumptions about how
    population parameters change with forecasted environmental variables.
  3: The study addresses uncertainty by considering multiple stock assessment configurations
    and the uncertainty of the parameters of a specific configuration. They identify
    environmental variables for further analyses, and develop future catch time series
    that reflect model configurations, variables, and harvest control rules.
  5: Eggs are stenothermic, where higher temperatures may lead to high yolk sac absorption
    and poor feeding conditions. Temperature may affect food availability and energy
    allocation of juveniles. Larval Pacific cod's behavior, growth, and lipid composition
    may be sensitive to CO2 levels.
  7: Summer SST is the 'best' environmental variable for both annual deviations in
    L1.5 and recruitment about mean recruitment. Increasing summer sea surface temperature
    leads to faster growth (larger L1.5) but lower expected recruitment, with the
    effect on recruitment being stronger than that on growth.
  8: Model configurations show varied performance, with configuration 4 generally
    giving more favorable outcomes unless under the MIROC ssp126 scenario, where configurations
    1 and 3 perform better.
  9: Environmental effects will likely lead to lower production and sustainable catches.
    Risk of population decline is higher when using higher catch time series (MIROC
    ssp126) and lower when catch limits are based on models that account for environmental
    drivers (GFDL ssp585). Ignoring parameter uncertainty can lead to overly optimistic
    projections.
  10: Current harvest control rules, especially those not accounting for future environmental
    effects, may fail to conserve the stock. Declines in biomass and catch are projected
    if current harvest control rules persist. Benefits are observed in terms of conservation
    and utilization performance of adopting a sloped (or threshold) harvest control
    rule. Harvest control rules are based on FMEY.
  11: Assessment model configuration may be as important, or more important, than
    the environmental scenario. Results are potentially overly optimistic due to the
    lack of a stock-recruitment relationship. Future work should integrate a stock-recruitment
    relationship into the assessment and consider a broader range of models.
  12: Accounting for Earth System Model uncertainty is important in resource analysis
    and management. Differences in projected biomass and catch are found under the
    three environmental models, even under the same emission scenario. Climate change
    signals as simulated by Earth System Models only differ significantly across the
    models and emission scenarios in the longer-term future, that is, after the mid-21st
    century.
  13: Spawning area of EBS Pacific cod may expand in the southern part of the eastern
    Bering Sea under warming. Low potential for spawning in the northern part of the
    eastern Bering Sea where Pacific cod redistributed during recent marine heatwaves.
  14: Updating projections based on climate-enhanced stock assessments and reviewing
    consistency of relationships between environmental variables and population parameters
    is important.
  15: The image is likely used to analyze and compare results across models for statistical
    or analytical purposes.
  16: Climate effects in scenarios with highest warming rates exceed the benefit of
    the harvest control rule by the end of the century.
Methodology:
  2: Extends stock assessment for Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) cod by allowing environmental
    variables to influence the length of age-1.5 animals (L1.5) and the mean recruitment.
  3: The analysis uses a stock assessment model with age and length classes, incorporates
    environmental variables into population dynamics models, and projects future catch
    time-series based on different climate scenarios and harvest control rules. The
    models are applied to Eastern Bering Sea Pacific cod.
  4: The paper outlines a method for projecting future catch series of a stock assessment
    that accounts for uncertainty in model structure, the environmental variables
    linked to parameters, and the Earth System Model/emission scenarios. It uses Bayesian
    methods with the NUTS MCMC algorithm for parameter estimation, drawing catch series
    from posterior distributions.
  5: Uses dynamically downscaled hindcasts, historical runs, and projections from
    Earth System Models. Employs a high-resolution oceanographic model (Bering10K
    ROMSNPZ). Uses delta-corrected timeseries for bias correction. Considers CMIP6
    Earth System Models GFDL-ESM4, CESM-CAM6, and MIROC-ES2L under SSP126 and SSP585
    emission scenarios.
  7: Uses four assessment model configurations, six environmental scenarios (three
    Earth System Models times two emission scenarios), and two harvest control rules
    to project future catch. Includes deterministic projections and explores structural,
    process, and parameter uncertainty by sampling posterior distributions. The models
    relate environmental variables to length at age-1.5 (L1.5) and mean recruitment.
  8: The analysis uses different assessment model configurations and scenarios based
    on projected sea surface temperatures (e.g., CESM ssp585, GFDL ssp585, MIROC ssp126)
    to evaluate recruitment and biomass outcomes.
  9: Extended single-species models are used to project cod population dynamics under
    different climate scenarios, accounting for parameter uncertainty and process
    error. Projections extend to 2100, using different assessment models and catch
    time-series.
  10: The analysis uses an environmental model to project outcomes under six environmental
    scenarios and four assessment model configurations based on harvest control rules
    (specifically the 40% control rule). The time period for the projections is 2024-2099,
    based on data from 1977-2023.
  11: Uses assessment model configurations considered by the Scientific and Statistical
    Committee of the US North Pacific Fishery Management Council to project future
    recruitment and biomass under different climate scenarios. Models include cesm,
    gfdl, and miroc under SSP126 and SSP585 scenarios. Analysis assumes recruitment
    is distributed about mean recruitment with no stock-recruitment relationship.
  12: The analysis uses multiple environmental scenarios and assessment model configurations
    to project spawning biomass under different catch limits derived from climate
    models and control rules (40-5 control rule and constant F control rule). Model
    selection approaches were used to select the relationships between population
    parameters and environmental variables
  13: The projection accounts for parameter uncertainty and process error. The analysis
    assumes stationarity in the relationship between environmental conditions and
    recruitment.
  15: The analysis involves exploring alternative models and considering cumulative
    impacts of environmental variables on biological processes; The likelihood function
    is used to reflect that environmental variables may provide indices of deviations.
    Constant F control rule.
  16: The study uses a methodology that includes projection assumptions and the use
    of harvest control rules.
  17: The page discusses integrated modeling, stock assessment methodologies (e.g.,
    Stock Synthesis), harvest control rules, and the use of climate scenarios (CMIP6)
    and shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) in fisheries management.
More Notes:
  2: The paper outlines a best practices framework for conducting 'climate-enhanced'
    single-species model projections, considering uncertainty related to model selection,
    environmental drivers, Earth System Models/emission scenarios, parameter uncertainty,
    and process error.
  3: The assessment model configurations differ in terms of time-varying parameters
    and the data used for parameter estimation. Parameters can be related to environmental
    variables, with allowance for time-variation depending on whether annual deviations
    are additive or multiplicative.
  5: The analysis spans 1970-2022 for hindcasts, 1980-2015 for historical data, and
    2022-2100 for projected conditions.
  7: The explained variance for these environmental drivers is not very high. Analyses
    are based on the environmental model selected using AIC and the null environmental
    model.
  9: The study compares different approaches to setting catch limits in the face of
    climate change, finding that strategies which reduce catch limits in response
    to reduced biomass are more robust. The MIROC ssp126 scenario leads to population
    collapse.
  10: The simulated catch streams, and hence biomass trajectories, are acknowledged
    as potentially pessimistic even with perfect information.
  11: The CEATTLE model (Climate-enhanced Age-based model with Temperature-specific
    Trophic Linkages and Energetics) is suggested for exploring changes in natural
    mortality due to trophic interactions. The projections are based on one hypothesis
    related to environmental variables influencing growth and recruitment but additional
    hypotheses could have been included. Model uncertainty for EBS Pacific cod is
    much greater than reflected by the four assessment model configurations.
  12: The analysis assumes the relationships between population parameters and environmental
    variables included in the analyses.
  14: The study uses MIROC ssp126 climate scenarios to set catch limits in simulations.
    Further research is needed to elucidate which biological processes mediate the
    effects of temperature on Pacific cod.
  15: The paper acknowledges an inability to make projections for all environmental
    variables concerned due to data limitations (e.g., advection, prey availability,
    predation).
  16: The study identifies trade-offs in management and emphasizes fully quantifying
    uncertainty in climate-enhanced assessment methods.
Quantitative material:

    distributions to quantify parameter uncertainty. Figure 1 illustrates a threshold
    control rule with a target exploitation rate of F40.
  4: "Uses 1000 draws from posterior distributions for projections. MCMC sampling\
    \ used 5 chains of length 1200 with first 200 discarded, resulting in 5000 parameter\
    \ vectors, which were then thinned by conducting projections for every 5th vector.\
    \ Convergence defined as all effective sample sizes above 500 and \u0302R values\
    \ less than 1.022."
  5: "Future environmental projections (2023\u20132099) differ by the emission scenario\
    \ (i.e., ssp126 and ssp585) and downscaled Earth System Model."
  7: "\u0394AIC values and AIC weights for different models with different selections\
    \ related to environmental drivers of growth and recruitment. Also, catch sizes\
    \ are estimated for different scenarios (e.g., catches equilibrate at close to\
    \ 170,000 t under the null environmental model)."
  8: Projections indicate that under all scenarios, spawning biomass will be below
    the 40% target of unfished level by the end of the period, with some scenarios
    predicting a drop below 20%.
  9: Probability of spawning biomass dropping below 20% of unfished spawning biomass

    scenarios and models.

    level over time, including median (blue line), 50% and 90% confidence intervals
    (shaded areas). The horizontal green and red lines are 40% and 20% of the average
    unexplored biomass when the effects of climate are ignored.
  13: The probability of being below 20% of unfished spawning biomass is quantified.
  14: The probability of spawning biomass dropping below four threshold levels is
    quantified, with medians, 50% intervals, and 90% intervals presented.
  15: The figure presents bar charts and a boxplot related to model performance but
    specific values are not extracted here.
  16: Setting catch limits based on certain scenarios generally keeps the stock above
    the threshold of 20% of unfished spawning biomass.
