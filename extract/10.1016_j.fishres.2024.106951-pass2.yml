Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increases in temperature are found to increase weight-at-age but reduce recruitment.
    The negative effects on recruitment outweigh the positive effects on weight-at-age.
  8: Summer sea surface temperature (SST) changes, driven by different environmental
    scenarios (ssp126, ssp585) from climate models CESM and GFDL.
  9: Summer sea surface temperature (SST); environmental scenarios (ssp126, ssp585);
    catch limits based on different environmental models
Highlights:
  1: Current harvest control rules may fail to conserve the stock if the inferred
    catch limits are taken, leading to declines in biomass, catch, and profits, particularly
    long-term.
  8: Catches and spawning biomass of Pacific cod are projected to decline, particularly
    after 2040. Even optimistic scenarios (ssp126) result in spawning biomass below
    the target level. Pessimistic scenarios (ssp585) predict the stock will drop below
    20% of unfished spawning biomass.
  9: Environmental effects are likely to lead to lower production and hence lower
    sustainable catch; using a catch control rule that reduces catch limits in the
    face of reduced biomass is beneficial
Methodology:
  1: Projections are based on a harvest control rule that attempts to maximize the
    difference between revenue and variable costs based on the current growth and
    recruitment dynamics of the stock.
  8: Statistical catch-at-age stock assessment models with different configurations,
    projecting future stock status under various environmental scenarios and harvest
    control rules. The time horizon is until the end of the projection period. Six
    catch time-series produced by assessment model configuration 1.
  9: Extended single-species models are used to examine the consequences of future
    climate impacts on cod. Projections are based on MLEs for each model, accounting
    for parameter uncertainty and future process error.
More Notes:
  1: The study captures structural model uncertainty, process error in future recruitment,
    and uncertainty in the parameter estimates of the population dynamics model when
    conducting projections.
  8: Assessment model configuration impacts performance metrics less than environmental
    scenarios. The impact of different harvest control rules matters.
  9: The study confirms that sensitivity to environmental scenarios is a key source
    of uncertainty. The consequences of climate impacts on cod in the north Pacific
    are examined.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Profits for the fishery
  8: Catches and spawning biomass of Pacific cod in the eastern Bering Sea.
  9: Profit during the last 20 years of the projection period, expressed as a percentage
    of that during the first 10 years of this period; probability of spawning biomass
    being below thresholds
Quantitative material:
  1: Keeping the stock above the threshold of 20 % of unfished spawning biomass under
    most climate scenarios and also achieves long-term profits at or greater than
    those expected in the next ten years under the environmental scenario that leads
    to the poorest outcomes (GFDL ssp585).
  8: Projections of spawning biomass relative to the unfished level; R-squared values
    (0.117-0.168) for models relating recruitment to environmental drivers; target
    level of 40% of the unfished spawning biomass.
  9: Distributions (over assessment models, environmental scenarios, and parameter
    vectors) for profit percentages; probability of dropping below 20% of unfished
    spawning biomass threshold
