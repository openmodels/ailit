  3: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Slow onset climate events such as desertification, sea level rise, and loss of
    biodiversity will place an increasing number of people at risk of poverty and
    social marginalization.
  3: Climate crisis; unprecedented rate of environmental degradation caused by human
    activities; experienced shocks; climate policies.
Highlights:
  1: Establishing national social protection systems aligned with the 2030 Agenda
    for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement could be a key policy approach
    to address increasing risks from long-term changes to the climate system.
  3: A comprehensive approach is needed to capture both risks and opportunities to
    the social protection sector created by environmental protection and climate change
    mitigation policies.
Methodology:
  1: Through a review of conceptual and empirical literature, this study explores
    the potential for social protection to address slow onset events by looking into
    the multiple dimensions of vulnerability and resilience.
More Notes:
  1: The paper further derives recommendations on how this potential can be translated
    into strategic policy agendas and discusses options for financing such interventions
    in developing countries.
  3: The paper focuses on the role of social protection in managing climate change
    risks and promoting resilience. It identifies the need to design social protection
    programs that facilitate pro-poor green development, protect nature, and enhance
    ecological resilience.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  3: Losses and damages from slow onset events (SOEs); capacity of individuals and
    households to absorb, anticipate and cope with climate extremes; poverty and marginalization.
