Drivers of Risk:
  2: Anthropogenic emissions increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, resulting in
    radiative forcing.
  3: Radiative forcing F resulting from greenhouse gases, aerosols, ozone precursors,
    land use change, and other anthropogenic influences.
  4: Radiative forcing under different emissions scenarios, temperature anomalies.
  5: Temperature projections under shared socioeconomic pathways SSP4-6.0 and SSP3-7.0
    drive economic damages.
  6: Temperature changes under the shared socioeconomic pathways SSP4-6.0 and SSP3-7.0
    drive the risk of economic damages.

Highlights:
  2: A model with a temperature-dependent climate feedback is most consistent with
    global mean surface temperature observations, but the sign of the temperature-dependence
    is opposite of what Earth system models suggest. Structural uncertainty dominates
    overall non-socioeconomic uncertainty in economic projections of climate change
    damages.
  3: Physical structural uncertainty is substantial in climate economics calculations,
    and in climate projections in general. Reported uncertainties of such projections
    may be appreciably underestimated.
  4: The paper aims to quantify the relative importance of structural uncertainty
    (uncertainty about the correct model structure) versus parametric uncertainty
    (uncertainty about the parameters within a given model structure) in climate change
    projections and economic damages.
  5: Structural uncertainty is dominant in temperature projections and propagates
    into economic damages.
  6: Structural uncertainty is a more significant contributor to the uncertainty of
    economic damages than parametric uncertainty.
  7: "The paper shows that structural uncertainty plays an important role in reduced\
    \ complexity climate models\u2019 total uncertainty, which must be accounted for\
    \ in their physical projections, and especially in the socioeconomic projections\
    \ that use such simple representations of climate physics. Paleo-observations\
    \ either need to be used with a substantially inflated uncertainty and/or with\
    \ extreme caution."
Methodology:
  2: A Bayesian approach is used to quantify structural uncertainty in climate projections,
    using energy-balance models. A model selection parameter switches on climate nonlinearities
    and multidecadal climate feedbacks.
  3: 'A computational Bayesian approach involving: specifying a model (linear EBM),
    specifying prior distributions for parameters, drawing samples, computing likelihood
    based on observations, weighing samples, and projecting into the future probabilistically.'
  4: "Uses a climate model with multiple sub-models representing different formulations\
    \ of climate dynamics (linear, T-dependent heat capacity, F-dependent heat capacity,\
    \ T-dependent feedback, F-dependent feedback, slow feedback). Model selection\
    \ is governed by a parameter \xB5 with uniform prior. An ensemble of radiative\
    \ forcing timeseries is used to generate model temperature time series from 1850-2020.\
    \ The model is then forced with future radiative forcing projections under different\
    \ emissions scenarios to generate probabilistic projections of future conditions."
  5: Damage calculations use the approach and default assumptions from [10], including
    the damage function from Weitzman [25] and a discount rate of 4.255%.
  6: The analysis uses a temperature-dependent feedback model and a multi-model ensemble
    to project temperature changes and calculates economic damages using different
    damage functions and discount rates.
  7: The paper uses publicly available data and code is available at github.com/bbcael.
    The paper considers the role of structural uncertainty in reduced complexity climate
    models.
More Notes:
  2: The difference in the sign of temperature dependence is likely due to the assumption
    that the recent pattern effect can be represented as a temperature dependence.
  3: The paper focuses on quantifying structural uncertainty in a simple Energy Balance
    Model (EBM) used by Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs).
  5: The preferred model structure has 45% of the posterior mass, but the remaining
    models have 55%, indicating an important role for structural uncertainty.
  6: "Reductions in structural uncertainty may be possible by incorporating known\
    \ phenomena such as the El Ni\xF1o Southern Oscillation or the pattern effect\
    \ more explicitly."

Quantitative material:
  2: Structural uncertainty dwarfsparametric uncertainty in temperature projections
    under shared socioeconomic pathways similar to current emissions reduction targets.
  3: Structural uncertainty is much larger than parametric uncertainty for projections
    of T (global mean surface temperature).
  4: Uses discount rates of 4.255% and 2.955%, and defines a metric u(X) to quantify
    the importance of structural uncertainty in projections.
  5: Structural uncertainty is dominant for temperature projections under SSP4-6.0;
    u(T(2100))=2.0 and u(T(2300))=2.7. For SSP3-7.0, u(T(2100))=2.3 and u(T(2300))=4.1.
  6: The ratio of structural vs. parametric uncertainty (u) for economic damages is
    2.9 for SSP4-6.0 and 4.6 for SSP3-7.0, using the Weitzman damage function and
    a 4.255% discount rate.
