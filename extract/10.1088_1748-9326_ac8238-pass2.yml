Drivers of Risk:
  2: Uncertainty in climate projections (parametric, structural, and internal variability).
    Structural uncertainty is a dominant factor.
  3: Uncertainty in climate models (parametric, internal variability, and structural);
    Radiative forcing (greenhouse gases, aerosols, etc.)
  5: Temperature projections under shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs).
  6: Temperature increases under different socioeconomic pathways (SSP4-6.0 and SSP3-7.0);
    Structural and parametric uncertainty in climate models; Choice of damage function
    (Weitzman); Discount rate.
Highlights:
  2: Structural uncertainty is important for climate projections and dominates overall
    non-socioeconomic uncertainty in economic projections of climate change damages.
    A model with a temperature-dependent climate feedback is most consistent with
    global mean surface temperature observations, but the sign of the temperature-dependence
    is opposite of what Earth system models suggest.
  3: Structural uncertainty is much larger than parametric uncertainty for projections
    of temperature (T) and calculations of damages due to climate change; Reported
    uncertainties of climate projections may be underestimated due to the neglect
    of structural uncertainty.
  5: Structural uncertainty is dominant for temperature projections, which propagates
    into economic damages.
  6: "Structural uncertainty is a significant driver of uncertainty in economic damage\
    \ projections, often more so than parametric uncertainty. The choice of damage\
    \ function and discount rate significantly impacts the magnitude of projected\
    \ damages and the relative importance of structural uncertainty. The discrepancies\
    \ between the multi-model median and \u03BBT model median damages are also related\
    \ to the Weitzman damage function."
Methodology:
  2: "A Bayesian approach is used to quantify structural uncertainty in climate projections,\
    \ using idealised energy-balance-model representations of climate physics that\
    \ underpin many economists\u2019 integrated assessment models (IAMs)."
  3: Computational Bayesian approach using energy balance models (EBMs) to project
    global mean surface temperature (T); Focus on quantifying structural uncertainty
    in EBMs.
  5: Damage calculations using the approach and default assumptions from [10], Weitzman
    [25] damage function, and a discount rate of 4.255%.
  6: Uses a temperature-dependent feedback model and multi-model ensemble to project
    damages. Calculates damages over the period 2020-2300 using different damage functions
    and discount rates. Analyzes the ratio of structural to parametric uncertainty
    (u) for economic damages.
More Notes:
  2: The difference in the sign of temperature-dependence is likely due to the assumption
    that recent pattern effect can be represented as a temperature dependence.
  3: The study aims to quantify structural uncertainty in a simple EBM used by several
    Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs); The study acknowledges that economic models
    have additional uncertainties but focuses only on how physical uncertainty propagates
    into uncertainty in economic calculations.
  5: The temperature-dependent feedback model may be underestimating future warming
    due to a pattern effect in tropical convection.
  6: "The study emphasizes the importance of characterizing structural uncertainty\
    \ in both physical and economic projections of climate change. The approach used\
    \ in this paper can be applied to more complex climate models by using model selection\
    \ parameters for different components, if the model is computationally efficient\
    \ enough. Reducing structural uncertainty can be achieved by incorporating known\
    \ phenomena such as the El Ni\xF1o Southern Oscillation or leveraging observations\
    \ such as ocean heat content or paleorecords."
