Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on marine fisheries.
  2: Climate change impacts on ocean systems, affecting the life cycles, abundances,
    and distributions of marine species; Changes in fish distribution due to climate
    regime shifts.
  4: Projected increase in sea surface temperature anomalies.
  6: Climate change impacting marine fisheries, as measured by Sea Surface Temperature
    (SST) anomalies.
  9: Climate change impacts on marine fisheries.
  12: Climate change impacts on marine fisheries.
Highlights:
  1: Seven out of the ten most vulnerable countries are Small Island Developing States.
    More than 87% of least developed countries are within the top half of the vulnerability
    index. A negative correlation exists between vulnerability and per capita carbon
    emissions. The index provides a useful tool for prioritizing the allocation of
    climate finance, as well as activities aimed at capacity building and the transfer
    of marine technology.
  2: Coastal least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS)
    are particularly vulnerable, with deficits in adaptive capacity as the primary
    driver of this vulnerability.
  4: The paper constructs a vulnerability index for least developed countries regarding
    climate change impacts on marine fisheries, using IPCC framework (Exposure, Sensitivity,
    Adaptive Capacity).
  9: LDCs are generally more vulnerable to climate change impacts on marine fisheries
    than OECD member states. Exposure to climate change impacts on fisheries is not
    directly linked to national development levels. Adaptive capacity can be enhanced
    through national and sub-national action. A reduction in sensitivity can be complex,
    potentially leading to negative socio-economic outcomes.
  12: Systematically reducing vulnerability to the impacts of climate change on marine
    fisheries is closely linked to development objectives; Earmarking of climate finance
    to enhance adaptive capacity in countries scoring highly on the vulnerability
    index could bring a wide range of benefits.
Methodology:
  1: A vulnerability index is calculated based on exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive
    capacity, using 12 primary variables, building on the Intergovernmental Panel
    on Climate Change framework.
  2: Refines previous efforts to calculate a global index of the vulnerability of
    national economies to climate change impacts on fisheries; Expands on previous
    efforts by disaggregating marine and inland fisheries.
  4: Calculates a vulnerability index (V) as a function of exposure (E), sensitivity
    (S), and adaptive capacity (AC), where V = EN + SN + ACN; Index is normalized
    to a scale from 0 to 1.
  6: The study constructs indices for sensitivity and adaptive capacity of countries
    to climate change impacts on marine fisheries. Sensitivity is calculated as an
    index based on the number of fishers, the share of fisheries exports, the percentage
    of fishers in the economically active population, the weight of total fisheries
    landings, and the share of marine fish protein in total protein consumption. Adaptive
    capacity is assessed through an index combining fisheries subsidies, the ratio
    of industrial to small-scale fisheries, healthy life expectancy, governance capacity,
    education levels, and per capita GDP. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomaly is
    calculated using CMIP5 files, averaged for each country, and normalized.
  9: A vulnerability index is calculated, incorporating exposure, sensitivity, and
    adaptive capacity. The assessment covers the EEZs of 147 countries. The indices
    are calculated for all three RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) on two
    timescales (referring to S1 Table).
  12: Calculating vulnerability indices at different representative concentration
    pathways using CMIP5 models.
More Notes:
  4: The study updates an existing index by Allison et al. [14] with more recent data
    (post-2001).
  6: The analysis focuses on Least Developed Countries and their vulnerability to
    climate change effects on marine fisheries.
  9: The low vulnerability scores of OECD states are partially attributable to a continuous
    drop in employment in the fisheries sector.
  12: The study identifies the importance of climate finance for adaptation in vulnerable
    countries, specifically related to marine fisheries.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Food security, livelihoods, and public health are negatively influenced by climate
    change impacts on marine fisheries. Development trajectories are reshaped, and
    transboundary conflict may be sparked.
  2: Negative impacts on local and national economies due to climate change impacts
    on fisheries.
  4: No relevant information
  9: The vulnerability of marine fisheries to climate change impacts at the national
    level, which could affect livelihoods, employment, revenue, and fish protein consumption.
    Potential loss in revenue from fisheries, reduction in fish protein affecting
    health outcomes, and loss of livelihoods and greater unemployment due to reduction
    in number of fishers.

Quantitative material:
  1: Vulnerability index of 147 countries is calculated.
  4: No relevant information
  9: The paper presents vulnerability index scores for Least Developed Countries (LDCs)
    and OECD member states, broken down by quartiles for Exposure (E), Sensitivity
    (S), Adaptive Capacity (AC), and overall Vulnerability (V). Table 3 displays the
    geographical distribution of vulnerability by continent and quartile.

    approved for new projects in 2014, nearly double 2012 levels.
