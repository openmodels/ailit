Drivers of Risk:
  2: Tropical cyclone events and exposure.
Highlights:
  2: National growth responses to cyclone events are heterogeneous given the size
    and the development level of the country. Worldwide estimations are led by SIDS.
    SIDS experience a statistically significant negative impact on per capita GDP
    growth due to cyclone events, while non-SIDS show insignificant results. Negative
    impacts in SIDS appear to be driven by an increased dependence on foreign economic
    conditions, insufficient reconstruction capacities, and difficulties implementing
    adaptation policies.
Methodology:
  2: Panel data regression with time and country fixed effects to study the marginal
    cumulative effect over 15 years after a cyclone strike; Uses Tropical Cyclone
    Exposure Database (TCE-DAT) for cyclone data, Climatic Research Unit gridded Time
    Series database (CRU TS) for temperature and precipitation, and United Nations
    Statistics Division (UNSD) for per capita GDP; Uses an exogenous and scale-invariant
    predictor of cyclone events.
More Notes:
  2: Results for SIDS are consistent with neoclassical growth theory, predicting an
    immediate negative impact on economic growth. Lag structures are not particularly
    influential, and short-term impacts are most decisive. The negative sign associated
    with the lagged value of per capita GDP shows that the economy is still converging
    towards its steady state level after the cyclone strike.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Impact of cyclone events on per capita GDP growth rate.
Quantitative material:
  2: Immediate effect of one additional unit of cyclone exposure is to decrease growth
    rates in SIDS by -0.016 percentage point, and this negative effect drops to -0.024
    percentage point after 15 years.
