Drivers of Risk:
  2: Extreme weather events such as heatwaves, cold spells, droughts, and heavy rains
    can impact public health through various pathways, thereby indirectly influencing
    economic output.
  3: Climate change, specifically heatwaves, drought, and sea-level rise, driven by
    human activities (emissions of greenhouse gases like CO2 and methane).
  7: Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events (heatwaves, floods,
    hurricanes) driven by climate change. Production- and consumption-based CO2 and
    PM2.5 emissions contribute to climate change.
Highlights:
  2: 2022 saw record-breaking high temperatures and droughts in China, resulting in
    increased health-related economic losses.
  3: Climate-related risks are higher in southern and western regions.
  7: Record-breaking heat and drought of 2022 were associated with increased adverse
    health outcomes, including increased heatwave-related mortality and heat-related
    work loss. Human-caused climate change significantly contributed to mortality,
    productivity loss, drought, and flood impacts.
Methodology:
  7: The 2023 China Report of the Lancet Countdown tracks progress on health and climate
    change in China through 28 indicators across five domains.
More Notes:
  2: The page discusses the integration of health as a priority in climate intervention
    strategies, highlighting that many climate actions do not yet explicitly include
    health as a policy target.
  3: The study mentions that there are independent warning systems for extreme heat.
  7: Report is focused on health impacts of climate change in China. Recommends increased
    investment in renewable energy, harnessing synergies to reduce carbon and air
    pollutants, establishing meteorology-informed early warning systems, research
    on extreme weather events, and developing tailored health adaptation guidelines
    for different actors.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Labor productivity losses are mentioned as being related to heatwaves.
  7: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  2: 'In 2022, China''s exposure to record-breaking high temperatures and drought
    led to a significant increase in health-related losses: deaths, labor productivity
    losses, and safe outdoor activity time losses increased by 342%, 24%, and 67%
    respectively.'
  3: Energy system transformation and air pollution control avoided approximately
    72,000, 37,000, and 24,000 premature deaths in household, power, and industrial
    sectors respectively related to PM2.5.
  7: Wildfire exposure increased by 54% compared to the historical baseline, while
    heatwave-related mortality increased by 342%, heat-related work loss increased
    by 24%, safe outdoor physical activity loss increased by 67% and the resulting
    hours available for safe outdoor activities decreased by 9.6%. Human-caused climate
    change was responsible for 49.4% of heatwave-related mortality , 30.9% of heat-related
    labour productivity loss, 98.8% of population affected by drought, and 7.6% of
    population affected by flood in the previous 20 years.
