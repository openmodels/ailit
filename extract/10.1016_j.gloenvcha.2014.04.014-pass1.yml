Drivers of Risk:
  4: Extreme weather events (specifically, tropical cyclones and floods); Underlying
    vulnerabilities related to lower adaptation efficiency (less government spending,
    uneven income distribution, and bad governance).
  7: Natural disasters, climate events.
  8: "Unit price of adaptation (\u03C0); Efficiency parameter (\u03C6)."
  11: Intensity or magnitude of a natural disaster event; Sensitivity or exposure
    of society to events of given magnitude.
  13: Floods, cyclones, disaster magnitude, intensity and exposure, demand variables,
    efficiency spillovers, political risk
  14: Magnitude of the disaster, population size, GDP per capita, hazard exposure,
    income inequality (Gini coefficient), quality of political institutions (Political
    Risk variable)
  15: Investment Profile, religious tension/interference in politics, military influence
    in politics, external conflict, government expenditure to GDP, primary school
    enrolment rates, credit-to-GDP ratios.
  16: Magnitude and total GDP (normalization) of disasters are significant predictors
    of economic damages. Higher credit-to-GDP ratios may be associated with housing
    developments in vulnerable locations, increasing risk.
  17: Inequality (Gini coefficient), political risk, credit/GDP, life expectancy,
    trade openness, and type of climate hazard (floods vs. tropical cyclones).
  21: Floods and tropical cyclones, intensity of events (wind speed, rainfall, forward
    velocity, radius of maximum winds etc. for storms; local precipitation data and
    local topography for floods)

Highlights:
  4: 'The adaptation deficit is driven by two factors: a demand effect (demand for
    climate security increases with income) and an efficiency effect (adaptation productivity
    is enhanced in high-income countries due to better infrastructure and institutions).
    Lower adaptation efficiency is associated with less government spending, uneven
    income distribution, and bad governance.'
  5: The paper aims to analyze the adaptation deficit in low-income countries, questioning
    whether it stems from inefficient adaptation service provision or rational resource
    allocation to other pressing needs. The paper argues that both factors (demand
    effect and efficiency effect) play a role in how income affects climate security.
  7: Establishment of a theoretical framework linking income and disaster loss to
    rank country efficiency in disaster management.
  8: The income elasticity of demand for climate security indicates that wealthier
    nations will demand more adaptation.
  9: The paper identifies an income effect and an efficiency effect as two channels
    through which an adaptation deficit might occur.
  13: The paper examines the impact of floods and cyclones on lives lost and economic
    damages, using a richer set of explanatory variables than customary in the literature,
    including political risk.
  14: Higher GDP per capita is associated with a lower number of deaths from disasters;
    Higher income inequality is associated with more deaths from disasters; Better
    quality political institutions reduce disaster deaths.
  15: Better Investment Profile reduces disaster deaths. Lower risk of religious tension
    reduces deaths from floods. Lower risk of military influence and external conflict
    reduces deaths from tropical cyclones. Higher government expenditure to GDP reduces
    deaths from both floods and tropical cyclones. Higher primary school enrolment
    reduces disaster deaths from tropical cyclones. Higher credit-to-GDP ratios appear
    to be associated with an increased number of lives lost.
  16: Higher GDP per capita is associated with lower economic damages from floods
    and tropical cyclones.
  17: Higher inequality is associated with lower economic damages from floods, possibly
    due to location effects (poor people living in more vulnerable areas with fewer
    assets) or underreporting of economic losses suffered by the poor; Higher inequality
    is associated with higher economic damages from tropical cyclones; Better institutions
    (lower political risk) are associated with higher economic damages from tropical
    cyclones; Greater trade openness reduces economic losses from cyclone events.
  22: There is a strong demand effect whereby increased income reduces economic damages
    from climate disasters. Adaptation efficiency varies, even after controlling for
    income, and is influenced by government spending, institutional quality, and income
    distribution.
  23: Closing the adaptation deficit requires general growth measures and dedicated
    assistance with spill-over effects; Inclusive growth and institutional quality
    are important for adaptation; Some countries with good disaster risk management
    (e.g., Bangladesh) may still need adaptation assistance.
  25: Several papers focus on the impact of natural disasters on various macroeconomic
    outcomes like economic production, growth, and disaster losses. Adaptation to
    cyclone risk is also studied.
  26: Hurricane strikes impact economic growth in developing countries.
  28: Flood Magnitude and Population have a positive and statistically significant
    effect on the number of deaths caused by flood events. GDP per capita has a negative
    and statistically significant effect, suggesting higher income is associated with
    fewer deaths. Various measures of efficiency (Gini coefficient, political risk
    factors) are also statistically significant in some model specifications.
  29: Cyclone magnitude, population size, area, GDP per capita, and cyclone propensity
    are all significant predictors of the number of people killed by tropical cyclones.
    Several indicators related to country efficiency (Gini, political risk, school
    enrollment, credit/GDP, etc.) also appear to have significant associations.
  30: Flood magnitude and Total GDP are positively and significantly associated with
    increased economic damages from flood events across all model specifications.
    Higher Gini coefficients (income inequality) are significantly associated with
    higher economic damages. GDP per capita has a statistically significant negative
    relationship with economic damages from flood events.
  31: Magnitude of cyclones and total GDP consistently show a statistically significant
    positive relationship with economic damages. Area has a significant negative relationship.
    GDPpc shows a statistically significant negative relationship with damages. The
    Gini coefficient and political risk are positively associated with higher damages
    when included in the model. Socioeconomic condition and ethnic tensions are also
    positively related to economic damages, whereas investment profile is negatively
    related. Credit/GDP has a statistically significant positive relationship with
    damages, while trade has a statistically significant negative relationship with
    damages.
  32: Provides a ranking of countries based on their efficiency in reducing flood-related
    deaths.
  33: Provides a ranking of countries based on their efficiency in reducing disaster
    deaths from tropical cyclones. Higher index scores indicate greater efficiency.
  34: GDP per capita is positively correlated with political risk, life expectancy,
    and credit access; GDP is negatively correlated with GINI coefficient.
Methodology:
  4: Empirical analysis using panel data from the Munich Re natural catastrophe database,
    examining the relationship between income and adaptation to tropical cyclones
    and floods.
  7: Development of a theoretical model linking income to disaster loss through demand
    and supply-side efficiency. Empirical modeling to establish country efficiency
    rankings in disaster management.
  8: Representative household utility maximization model; Profit maximization model
    of climate security delivery; Derives demand and supply functions for adaptation.
  9: The paper models adaptation supply and demand to derive an equilibrium relationship
    between climate security and income, studying the adaptation deficit through income
    and efficiency effects.
  11: OLS and negative binomial regressions; separate estimation for each hazard type.
  13: "Regression analysis using data from the World Bank\u2019s World Development\
    \ Indicators database, Political Risk Services ICRG data, and other sources. Lagged\
    \ values are used for most explanatory variables to avoid endogeneity bias. Analysis\
    \ distinguishes between intensity and exposure, demand, and efficiency spillover\
    \ effects."
  14: Regressions are performed to assess the predictors of disaster fatalities, including
    magnitude, population, time trend, GDP per capita, hazard exposure, income inequality,
    and political institutions.
  15: Regression analysis is used to examine the relationship between disaster deaths
    and various political, economic, and social factors. The applicability of the
    results is likely limited to countries with similar characteristics and data availability.
  16: Regression analysis (log-log form) to estimate damage elasticities. The coefficients
    on GDP per capita from these regressions are comparable as damage elasticities.
  17: Regression analysis; comparing regressions for deaths from floods and economic
    damages from floods to show relationships between drivers of risk and outcomes
    of interest.
  19: The efficiency component of the model measures productive or cost efficiency
    across countries. OLS regressions with a log-log model specification is used when
    economic damages are the outcome variable. Negative binomial regression is used
    when number of deaths is the outcome variable. A Poisson QMLE estimator was also
    tested with consistent results.
  20: The paper uses regression analysis to identify the efficiency effect of various
    factors on economic damages from natural disaster events.
  21: Regression analysis controlling for population, land mass, and a time trend;
    experimented with urbanisation as an additional control.
  22: Empirical analysis of the link between income and adaptation to past and future
    climate events.
  23: Identifies countries where efficiency spill-overs from adaptation are weakest;
    controls for GDP or population size.
  25: Econometric analysis using panel data, cross-sectional analysis, stochastic
    frontier analysis.
  26: Economic modelling
  28: Negative binomial regression analysis is used to model the number of deaths
    caused by flood events. Explanatory variables are entered in logs and lagged one
    period (except Magnitude, Area, and Gini). Standard errors are clustered at the
    country level. Applicable when modeling count data with overdispersion.
  29: Negative binomial regression analysis of panel data, with standard errors clustered
    at the country level. Explanatory variables (except Magnitude, Area and Gini)
    are lagged one period.
  30: The analysis uses a regression model with economic damages as the dependent
    variable. Explanatory variables are entered in logs and lagged one period (except
    Magnitude, Area, and Gini). Standard errors are clustered at the country level.
  31: The analysis uses a panel regression model with economic damages as the dependent
    variable and various macroeconomic and socio-economic factors as independent variables.
    Standard errors are clustered at the country level. Explanatory variables are
    entered in logs and lagged one period (except for Magnitude, Area, and Gini).
    Statistical significance is indicated by asterisks (* p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01).
  32: The efficiency index is normalized to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation
    of one, based on data on the number of people killed in floods. Higher scores
    suggest greater efficiency. The table presents average index values over the sample
    period.
  33: Ranking countries based on 'numbers killed' (presumably by tropical cyclones),
    calculating an index, normalizing the index, and averaging the index over the
    sample period.
  34: The methodology is not explicitly stated, but seems to involve statistical analysis
    using panel data, including calculating summary statistics and correlations. Timeframe
    may be around 1995.
More Notes:
  4: The study identifies countries with the largest adaptation inefficiencies and
    suggests policy implications for international efforts to close the adaptation
    deficit, including inclusive growth policies and targeted adaptation support.
  7: 'The paper distinguishes itself by focusing on explaining the severity of disaster
    losses, rather than the effect of disasters on economic growth. The paper is structured
    as follows: a theoretical model in Section 2, the empirical model in Section 3,
    results in Section 4, potential shortcomings and methodological refinements in
    Section 5, and a conclusion in Section 6.'
  8: The model treats climate security as a consumption good that provides utility.
  9: The existence and sign of the efficiency effect is noted as not able to be determined
    a priori and must await empirical confirmation.
  11: The paper addresses the issue of missing adaptation effort data by postulating
    a relationship between adaptation effort and observed damages. It uses the Munich
    Re database for economic damage estimates, citing its unique perspective as a
    re-insurance company.
  13: The study uses Gini coefficient data by averaging available observations due
    to its sporadic availability. Alternative institutional quality measures were
    tested as robustness checks. The Political Risk variable restricts the sample
    to years since 1985.
  14: The time trend for deaths from flood events is significant and negative, indicating
    that these have been reduced over time; The relationship between GDP per capita
    and disaster deaths is robust to the inclusion of efficiency variables.
  17: The study seeks to determine the relative adaptation efficiency of countries.
  19: The authors experimented with alternative estimators to the negative binomial,
    notably a Poisson QMLE estimator, and the results are consistent. The authors
    state that stochastic frontier analysis is less appropriate for cross-country
    comparisons involving large variation in economic and social conditions.
  20: The paper considers the use of zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models,
    but ultimately rejects it. Country fixed effects are excluded to capture slowly
    evolving differences in efficiency across countries.
  21: The analysis focuses on floods and tropical cyclones, excluding other climate-related
    disasters like droughts, heat waves, and wind storms, and also earthquakes. The
    paper acknowledges that disaster magnitude variables are rough proxies for true
    event intensity.
  23: Methodological and data problems prevent reliable country identification; Richer
    dynamics like economic diversification, urbanization, and migration to coasts
    affect long-term vulnerability.
  28: The analysis explores different model specifications (columns 1-4) by sequentially
    including more explanatory variables. The models consider the effects of 'Normalisation'
    factors (Magnitude, Population, Area, Time Trend), 'Demand' factors (GDPpc, Flood
    Propensity), and 'Efficiency' factors (Gini, Political Risk, Governance, Education,
    Credit, Health, Trade, Government Expenditure).
  29: The analysis controls for various factors related to 'Normalization', 'Demand',
    and 'Efficiency' to explain the number of deaths from tropical cyclones.
  30: The study explores the roles of normalisation, demand, and efficiency factors
    in affecting economic damages from flood events.
  31: The table includes the number of observations and countries included in each
    regression. Different columns (1-4) represent different model specifications,
    with different combinations of independent variables included in each.
  32: The rankings are based on data from column 4 of Table 1 (not included in the
    provided page).
  33: The rankings are based on data from column 4 of Table 2, which focuses on the
    number of deaths caused by tropical cyclones. The table only considers one specific
    type of disaster, tropical cyclones.
  34: The variable names are abbreviated and may require further explanation to fully
    understand their meaning. Disaster deaths is included, but it is unclear if it
    is caused by climate change. This page provides descriptive statistics and correlations,
    but doesn't model climate change adaptation directly.

Quantitative Material:
  30: The table presents regression coefficients and standard errors for various drivers
    of economic damages from flood events. For example, in model (1), the coefficient
    for 'Magnitude' is 0.687*** (p<0.01), and for Total GDP is 0.885*** (p<0.01)
Quantitative material:

    empirically analyze the relationship between income and adaptation to climate
    events.
  13: The study presents results in Tables 1-4 based on the four sets of regressions
    for two impact measures (lives lost, economic damages) and two hazard types (floods,
    cyclones).
  14: A 10% rise in GDP per capita reduces fatalities from floods by around 1.4% at
    the median value of loss; a 10% rise in GDP per capita reduces median deaths from

    in regressions for economic damages from tropical cyclones; Negative coefficient
    on trade openness in regressions for economic damages from tropical cyclones.

    from climate disasters by between 3% and 5%, or perhaps as much as 19% in the
    case of cyclones.
