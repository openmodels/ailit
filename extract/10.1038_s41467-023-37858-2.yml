Drivers of Risk:
  1: The paper identifies coral-reef degradation, sea-level rise, and changes in wave
    and storm patterns as impacts on the reefs' ability to mitigate coastal flooding.
  2: The drivers of risk are reef degradation (specifically bioerosion), sea-level
    rise, and changes in bathymetry.
  3: The outcomes are impacted by climate-related mortality, early thermal-stress
    events, and diseases such as stony coral tissue-loss disease (SCTLD).
  4: Sea-level rise, waves, storm surge
  5: Sea-level rise, storm intensity (10-year and 50-year storms), and coral reef
    erosion.
  6: Climate change leading to coral loss, episodic natural and human impacts (e.g.,
    Hurricane Maria, Stony Coral Tissue Loss Disease - SCTLD), sea-level rise, storms,
    and physical erosion.
  7: Sea-level rise, storms (increased frequency of severe storms), and climate change
    impacts on coral reefs are identified as drivers of risk.
  8: The paper identifies extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and bioerosion as
    drivers of risk impacting coastal communities.
  9: Coral-reef degradation, sea-level rise, bioerosion, carbonate production, physical
    erosion, chemical dissolution
  10: Increased mortality due to climate change impacts, storms leading to fragmentation,
    sea-level rise, storm surge.
Evaluation overview:
  1: This page evaluates the potential for coral reef restoration to mitigate coastal
    flooding as sea levels rise.
  2: This study evaluates the impact of reef degradation and restoration on coastal
    flooding potential, considering sea-level rise.
  3: The paper evaluates the impact of restoring reef-building corals, specifically
    focusing on mortality rates and coral cover changes over time.
  4: Coastal flooding potential during storms
  5: Coastal flooding potential due to sea-level rise and storm events.
  6: The paper evaluates reef accretion potential and its impact on coastal protection
    (specifically, wave-driven flooding).
  7: The paper evaluates the potential for coral reef restoration to mitigate coastal
    flooding under sea-level rise scenarios.
  8: The paper evaluates the potential of coral reef restoration to combat sea-level
    rise and associated coastal-flooding by supporting reef accretion.
  9: Impact of reef degradation on future total water levels; potential for restoring
    reef-building corals and reef-accretion potential
  10: Evaluates the impact of climate change and restoration efforts on A. palmata
    (elkhorn coral) populations and reef accretion potential.
Highlights:
  1: The study suggests that successful restoration of Acropora palmata could mitigate
    extreme coastal flooding impacts by reversing projected reef erosion and allowing
    reefs to keep pace with moderate sea-level rise projections.
  2: Reef erosion will result in a small, but measurable, increase in flooding potential
    by the end of the century. Successful coral-reef restoration could reduce the
    impacts of sea-level rise and wave-driven water levels.
  3: A large-scale restoration effort before 2030 could significantly increase A.
    palmata cover and enhance reef-accretion potential, allowing the reef to keep
    pace with sea-level rise if additional management actions occur.
  4: "Coral restoration (increasing A. palmata cover to \u2265 36%) could promote\
    \ reef accretion and reduce total water levels during future storms, potentially\
    \ negating the wave-driven component associated with low-end sea-level-rise scenarios.\
    \ Restoration could reduce total water levels by up to 0.81 m (\xB10.03) on average\
    \ under intermediate-to-high sea-level rise scenarios."
  5: Sea-level rise is the most significant driver of increased total water levels
    and flooding potential. Higher total water levels are projected for the northern
    sector of Buck Island due to reef erosion. Reef erosion has become the dominant
    process.
  6: Only the southern reef crest exhibited marginally positive reef-accretion potential.
    Rising sea levels will be the dominant driver of future coastal flooding risk.
    Coral restoration can help mitigate some of the impacts of future sea-level rise
    by reducing total water levels (up to 0.81 m).
  7: Restoration could help to mitigate reef degradation and coastal flooding.
  8: Restoration efforts can potentially prevent significant coastal flooding risks
    by maintaining reef elevation and positively contributing to carbonate budgets,
    counteracting sea-level rise impacts.
  9: Reef-accretion potential quantified in this study is likely a maximum estimate
    of realized reef accretion.
  10: Restoration has the potential to increase coral cover and reef-accretion potential.
    Simple models were used to illustrate the potential of restoration to increase
    coral cover. Increased climate change impacts over time for which mortality was
    increased by 5% each decade (44% net survival by 2100); and decreased climate-change
    impacts over time through increased resilience, acclimatization, and adaptation
    of A. palmata for which mortality was decreased by 5% each decade (80% net survival
    by 2100).
Methodology:
  1: The analysis combines coral-growth measurements, carbonate-budget assessments,
    and hydrodynamic modeling to predict future coastal flooding under different scenarios.
  2: The study uses census-based carbonate-budget models, hydrodynamic modeling, and
    in situ measurements to assess reef-accretion potential and coastal flooding.
    Results are applicable to Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM).
  3: The analysis combines coral-growth experiments and a population model to project
    changes in coral cover and accretion rates under various restoration and mortality
    scenarios.
  4: Carbonate-budget models project reef-elevation change and reef-accretion potential
    at Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM) based on surveys in 2016 and restoration
    scenarios. Modeled total water levels under 10-year and 50-year storm scenarios
    with present-day bathymetry.
  5: Models are run with projected reef erosion and present-day bathymetries to assess
    the impact of reef erosion on maximum total water levels. Carbonate budget models
    project reef erosion.
  6: The study uses models to project reef elevation changes and total water levels
    under various sea-level rise, storm, and coral restoration scenarios, applicable
    to Buck Island.
  7: "Carbonate-budget and coral-growth models are used to project reef accretion\
    \ potential and its impact on coastal flooding. The models necessarily present\
    \ a simplified version of reality that cannot consider the full complexity of\
    \ reef ecology. Also, reef-accretion potential represents a high-end estimate\
    \ of realized long-term reef accretion. To estimate the omission of non-biological\
    \ erosion, the approach of Toth et al. (2022) was followed, calculating a lower\
    \ uncertainty on reef-accretion potential based on the difference between maximum\
    \ Holocene reef accretion by A. palmata in St. Croix of 13.4 mm y\u22121 and estimated\
    \ historic reef-accretion potential based on the maximum observed A. palmata cover\
    \ there in the 1970s of 62%."
  8: The analysis uses carbonate budgets from 54 stratified-random sites to assess
    coral reef accretion versus erosion dynamics in different habitat sectors, specifically
    considering bioerosion rates by parrotfish and sea urchins.
  9: Uses ReefBudget v1 methodology to calculate carbonate budgets; linear mixed-effects
    models to evaluate spatial variability in coral cover, gross carbonate production,
    bioerosion, and coral reef-accretion potential; ANOSIM and SIMPER to compare contributions
    of calcifying taxa to carbonate production; matrix model projecting change in
    percent cover of A. palmata. Assessed vertical growth and calcification rates
    of A. palmata and Ps. strigosa at three locations around the island from June
    2019 to July 2021.
  10: Used a model incorporating survival rates and fragmentation to project A. palmata
    population size. Analyzed carbonate budgets to estimate reef-accretion potential
    under different restoration scenarios. Employed the XBeach hydrodynamic model
    to simulate wave and water-level transformation under various sea-level-rise and
    storm conditions, validating the model against observed wave data.
More Notes:
  1: The study highlights the long-term benefits of pursuing coral-reef restoration
    alongside climate-change mitigation efforts to ensure the persistence of essential
    coral-reef ecosystem services.
  2: The study focuses on a real-world example at Buck Island Reef National Monument,
    St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. The parrotfish Sparisoma viride is a primary driver
    of bioerosion.
  3: Optimistic scenarios suggest coral cover could remain elevated by more than 10%
    to 2100 with reduced mortality and sufficient initial outplants.
  5: The study focuses on Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM). Loss of A. palmata
    may have been sufficient to halt reef accretion at BIRNM. High parrotfish bioerosion
    rates may have unintended consequences.
  6: Physical erosion from storms and recent declines in coral populations (due to
    SCTLD) suggest the study's estimates of present-day reef-accretion potential are
    overly optimistic. Restoration success depends on its impact on both coral growth
    and reef accretion. Restoration may require increased coral resilience, acclimatization,
    and/or adaptation.
  8: Restoration efforts, when successful, present a window of opportunity to mitigate
    the worst impacts of climate change on reefs and coastal protection infrastructure.
  9: Data on local A. palmata and Ps. strigosa calcification rates were collected
    after the carbonate budget and hydrodynamic modeling was completed.  Assumes growth
    of A. palmata is isometric in population model.
  10: Acknowledges uncertainties regarding the success of restoration outcomes. Results
    should be considered an optimistic, maximum estimate of long-term reef accretion.
    The study converted surface area from models to percent cover by dividing the
    sum of colony areas by the total area of reef-crest habitat on BIRNM.
Quantitative material:
  1: The analysis quantifies future coastal flooding under various coral-restoration,
    sea-level rise, and storm scenarios, with a focus on the ~0.5 m sea-level rise
    expected by 2100.
  2: "Reef-accretion potential averaged -1.56 mm y\u22121 (\xB10.27 SE) across 54\
    \ sites in 2016. Average projected elevation change of the southern reef crest\
    \ by 2100 was +1 cm (\xB110 cm). Estimated bioerosion averaged -13.09 (\xB10.02)\
    \ cm by 2100."
  3: Quantitative information includes calcification rates, growth rates of A. palmata
    and Ps. strigosa, percent increases in coral cover under different scenarios,
    and projected vertical accretion rates.
  4: Increasing Acropora palmata cover by ~30% could allow the reef to keep pace with
    low to intermediate-low projections of relative sea-level rise.
  5: "Projects maximum total water levels at 2100 under different sea-level rise scenarios\
    \ (up to +2.0m) and storm intensities. Reef accretion potential averaging -1.56\
    \ mm y\u22121. Carbonate production by all species combined is now an order of\
    \ magnitude lower at just 1.27 (\xB10.27) kg CaCO3 m\u22122 y\u22121, compared\
    \ to 15.18 kg CaCO3 m\u22122 y\u22121 in the late 1970s."
  6: "Projects 0.12-0.23 m loss of elevation for most reef zones by 2100, but predicts\
    \ the southern reef crest will more-or-less maintain its present-day elevation.\
    \ States individual outplanted A. palmata colonies could grow as fast as sea-level\
    \ rise (up to 13.4 mm y\u22121 in St. Croix). Mentions a goal of coral restoration\
    \ efforts targeting 1.5\u20123.0 individuals m\u22122 by 2030. Reports nearly\
    \ 30% (0.88 ha) of the total beach area on the western side of Buck Island has\
    \ been lost due to storm-driven erosion since 1954. Sea-level rise (+0 to +2.0m),\
    \ storms (10- and 50- year storms), and coral restoration scenarios are all modeled\
    \ to 2100."
  7: "Reef-accretion potential of the reef crest at BIRNM could exceed 5 mm y\u2212\
    1 with a 30% increase in A. palmata cover. A 40% reduction in reef accretion does\
    \ not change the conclusion that a sustained increase of 30% cover of A. palmata\
    \ (\u2265 36% total cover) on the BIRNM reef crest will allow the reef to keep\
    \ pace with low-end sea-level projection (~0.5m). A +30% cover could allow the\
    \ BIRNM reef crest to keep pace with sea-level rise to 2100 (i.e., ~0.5 m). This\
    \ outcome would reduce total water levels during storms by >10% (0.81 m) under\
    \ higher sea-level-rise scenarios. A location the size of the reef crest at BIRNM\
    \ is 166,407 m2. Increasing A. palmata cover on a reef the size of the one at\
    \ Buck Island to a level that could significantly impact shoreline protection\
    \ (+30% or 500,000 outplants) would cost ~$12.5 million USD."
  8: The study models sea-level rises of up to 0.96 m under SSP5-8.5 scenarios, with
    projected wave-driven water-level increases of ~0.2 m during storms by 2100.
  9: "Estimates change in percent cover of A. palmata in reef-crest habitats of BIRNM\
    \ for each decade from 2020 to 2100 following outplanting of 100,000, 250,000,\
    \ and 500,000 colonies, equivalent to ~0.6, 1.5, and 3.0 individuals m\u22122\
    \ across the 166,407 m2 total area of the BIRNM reef-crest habitat."
  10: 3% survival rate of A. palmata fragments after 12 years (1999-2011) in St. John,
    U.S. Virgin Islands. 58% population-level survival rate combining the 3% survival
    rate with a 55% fragmentation rate. Asexual fragmentation rate of 10% and fragment-mortality
    rate of 40%. Eight theoretical restoration scenarios increasing A. palmata cover
    by 5 to 30% at +5% intervals.
