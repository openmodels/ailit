Drivers of Risk:
  2: Sea-level rise, reef erosion, changes in reef-accretion capacity, wave-driven
    water levels.
  3: Increasing climate-related mortality (5% increase in mortality per decade) is
    a driver of risk, leading to a rapid decline in coral cover despite restoration
    efforts.
  5: Sea-level rise, storm intensity (10-year and 50-year storms), coral reef erosion,
    loss of Acropora palmata, coral bleaching, disease outbreaks
  7: Sea-level rise, severe storms (hurricanes), climate change impacts on coral reefs.
  8: Increased frequency of severe thermal-stress events and storms; impacts of ocean
    acidification; sea-level rise leading to coastal flooding and erosion due to extreme
    weather events.
  10: Sea-level rise, storm surge (related to wave conditions and storm intensity),
    and changes in coral mortality/survival rates are the drivers of risk investigated.

Highlights:
  2: Reef erosion will result in a small, but measurable, increase in flooding potential
    by the end of the century.
  3: A single, large-scale A. palmata outplanting effort before 2030 could result
    in increases in coral cover on the reef crest at BIRNM for the next 20 years.
  5: Sea-level rise is the most significant driver of increases in total water levels
    and thus flooding potential, higher total water levels under all sea-level-rise
    scenarios are projected for the northern sector of the island, corresponding to
    the areas of greatest projected reef erosion
  7: Restoration of reef-building species like A. palmata can return reef-accretion
    rates to historic baselines, mitigating the worst effects of sea-level rise on
    coastal flooding; high up-front costs of restoration could be balanced by the
    value of restoration to communities and economies and avoided damage to coastal
    infrastructure.
  8: Restoration has the potential to minimize climate-change impacts and provide
    an important component of solutions to support coral reefs and their function
    as coastal barriers into the future, combatting sea-level rise and coastal flooding.
  10: The paper models the potential of coral restoration to increase coral cover
    and reef-accretion potential. It acknowledges uncertainties regarding the success
    of restoration outcomes in practice. The study assesses the impact of future climate
    scenarios on nearshore hydrodynamics at Buck Island, U.S. Virgin Islands.

Methodology:
  2: Census-based carbonate-budget models, hydrodynamic modeling to determine impacts
    of bathymetry changes on coastal flooding potential by 2100. Impact of ongoing
    changes in reef-accretion capacity on coastal protection is studied. Real-world
    example of the impacts of reef degradation on coastal flooding using data collected
    at Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), located off the northeastern coast
    of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.
  3: A simple population model (assuming no reproduction) was developed based on average
    planar growth rates of A. palmata and literature-derived mortality and fragmentation
    rates to project potential changes in A. palmata cover on the BIRNM reef crest
    under various restoration and mortality scenarios (applicable to the BIRNM reef
    crest).
  5: Models projecting maximum total water levels at 2100 with projected reef erosion
    from carbonate-budget models under different storm and sea-level rise scenarios,
    comparison of models with and without projected reef erosion
  7: Carbonate-budget and coral-growth models; projection based on the baseline ecological
    and geomorphic setting of BIRNM.
  8: The study calculated carbonate budgets of 54 stratified-random sites using reef-census
    data collected in July 2016 and a modification of the ReefBudget v1 methodology.
  10: The study uses a combination of coral population modeling, carbonate budget
    calculations, and hydrodynamic modeling (XBeach) to assess the impact of sea-level
    rise, storm surge, and coral restoration on reef accretion potential and total
    water levels.

More Notes:
  2: Study area is Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM) in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
    The research combines carbonate budget studies with hydrodynamic modeling to assess
    the impact of reef degradation and restoration on coastal flooding.
  3: No relevant information
  5: Study area is Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM). Parrotfish bioerosion
    might be overestimated.
  7: The projections are only directly applicable to the baseline ecological and geomorphic
    setting of BIRNM but conclusions are relevant for coral reefs throughout the western
    Atlantic; Restoration efforts can be strategically placed to protect the most
    vulnerable human communities and infrastructure or critical natural, cultural,
    and historic resources.
  8: The study emphasizes the importance of addressing ongoing coral mortality for
    successful restoration efforts. It also supports cost-benefit analysis of coral
    restoration by providing guidance on the scale of restoration needed to revive
    reef accretion and maintain coastal protection.
  10: The paper focuses on a specific location (Buck Island Reef National Monument,
    St. Croix) and coral species (Acropora palmata). The paper focuses on ecological
    impacts, which would presumably affect other outcomes if they were considered.
    The paper notes that the projected reef-accretion potentials should be considered
    optimistic and maximum estimates.

Quantitative material:
  2: "Reef-accretion potential varied between -5.31 and 6.21 mm y\u22121 and averaged\
    \ -1.56 mm y\u22121 (\xB10.27 standard error [SE]). Only \uFB01ve sites had positive\
    \ reef-accretion potential. Average projected elevation change of the southern\
    \ reef crest by 2100 was negligible at +1 cm (\xB110 cm). Bioerosion averaged\
    \ -13.09 (\xB10.02) cm by 2100."
  3: "Calcification rates of A. palmata ranged from 21.04 to 42.91 kg m\u22122 y\u2212\
    1, with an average of 29.07 kg m\u22122 y\u22121 (\xB11.26) during 2019-2021."
  5: "Maximum total water levels under different sea-level rise scenarios (0.0m to\
    \ +2.0m), Reef-accretion potential averaging -1.56 mm y\u22121, Carbonate production\
    \ by all species combined is now an order of magnitude lower at just 1.27 (\xB1\
    0.27) kg CaCO3 m\u22122 y\u22121"
  7: "Increase A. palmata cover by ~30% (to \u2265 36% total cover) could allow reef\
    \ crest to keep pace with sea-level rise to 2100 (~0.5 m); this would reduce total\
    \ water levels during storms by >10% (0.81 m); cost of restoration per A. palmata\
    \ fragment is ~$25 USD; median cost of restoration projects globally was ~$400,000\
    \ in U.S. dollars per hectare; BIRNM contributes >$2 million USD annually in tourism."
  8: The study projects a ~0.2 m increase in wave-driven water levels during storms.
    Restoration could keep water depths at the reef crest near ~0.30 m. Maximum erosion
    estimated in the study (0.45 m by 2100) could almost double the realized water
    levels over the reef crest at BIRNM by 2100 under SSP1-2.6 to SSP2-4.5 (~0.49
    m) to a level comparable to the highest sea-level rise predicted under SSP5-8.5
    (0.96 m).
  10: "The paper uses quantitative estimates of coral survival rates (3%, 60%, varying\
    \ scenarios), fragmentation rates (10%, 55% net), reef accretion rates (historical:\
    \ 13.4 mm y\u22121, potential: 29.07 kg m\u22122 y\u22121), and hydrodynamic parameters\
    \ (wave heights, periods, storm surge levels). It also presents sea-level rise\
    \ scenarios (+0.0, +0.2, +0.5, +1.2, and +2.0 m)."
