Drivers of Risk:
  1: Floods, influenced by global warming and socioeconomic changes (RCP8.5 and SSP3
    scenarios).
  2: Flood events and climate change affecting flood return periods and inundation
    depths are the drivers of risk.
  3: Inundation period and inundation depth derived from flood simulations
  5: Floods
  7: Inundation period and flood events impacting economic activities and productivity.
  8: Annual maximum inundation depth.
  9: Heavy rainfall leading to floods (river floods, overflowing/breaching flood control
    systems)
  10: River basin drainage area, flood events
  11: Floods, climate change; Inundation periods; Slope of river basins; Economic
    scale (GDP); uncertainties in each GCM.
  12: Climate change is identified as the primary driver for the projected increase
    in BI loss and asset damage.
  13: Climate change impacts on river basins
  14: Floods; Landslides triggered by heavy rain; Reduced productivity in commercial
    and industrial properties near rivers
  15: Floods, flood protection (or lack thereof).
  16: Floods, influenced by flood protection levels (FPL).
  17: Floods, flood protection level (FPL).
  18: Increased flood risk and magnitude due to climate change (RCP8.5 and SSP3 scenarios),
    Flood Plain Length (FPL), and Inundation periods.
  20: Floods, long-lasting inundation, cyclones, global warming.
Highlights:
  1: Flood-related business interruption losses are significant and can be similar
    in magnitude to direct asset damage.
  2: The study focuses on business interruption (BI) loss due to flooding and compares
    its importance relative to asset damage.
  3: "The study calculates BI loss and asset damage based on inundation period and\
    \ depth at a high resolution (30\u201D x 30\u201D)."
  5: Building height is assumed to be proportional to GDP per capita within each grid.
  7: Estimate of BI loss based on flood impact on productivity of secondary and tertiary
    industries.
  8: The study estimates asset damage caused by floods and validates the estimations
    against real-world flood events.
  9: CaMa-Flood model can reproduce the general trend of global flood risk. Estimated
    BI losses calculated for Namibia, Moldova, Pakistan (2011), Thailand, and Malawi
    were similar to the World Bank values.
  10: "The method of calculating asset damage was sufficiently accurate, at least\
    \ for global long-term averages; Spatial distribution of annual BI loss and BI\
    \ loss per GDP averaged from 1960 to 2013 according to river basin drainage area\
    \ (\u226510,000 km2)"
  11: Floods in river basins can lead to BI loss that can significantly impact GDP,
    especially in basins with long inundation periods and shallow slopes. The economic
    impact of floods, measured as BI loss relative to GDP, is smaller in regions with
    higher GDP.
  12: Future BI loss and asset damage due to climate change are projected to significantly
    increase, with high variability in projections as time progresses.
  13: Significant increases in BI loss and asset damage are projected under climate
    change scenarios (2021-2050 and 2061-2090) compared to the historical period (1971-2000).
    The spatial distribution of BI loss varies significantly, with certain regions
    like China, Thailand, and the Nile River basin expected to experience substantial
    increases.
  14: Previous asset damage-focused studies underestimated the economic impacts of
    floods, particularly in regions where the percentage of BI loss relative to asset
    damage was high. The ratio of BI loss to asset damage varies significantly across
    regions.
  15: Flood protection significantly reduces BI loss and asset damage; BI loss estimates
    can be drastically different depending on the presence of flood protection measures.
  16: Flood protection has a greater effect on BI loss than on asset damage. Higher
    flood protection levels (FPL) significantly reduce both the number of floods and
    the ratio of BI loss to asset damage.
  17: The ratio of BI loss to asset damage tends to be greater in river basins with
    low FPL; future ratios of BI loss to asset damage will be high even in large river
    basins with high FPL; BI loss to asset damage ratio is also expected to increase
    in most parts of China, India, and central Africa, as well as regions of Europe
    and America with high FPL; BI loss to asset damage ratio is projected to decrease
    in most parts of South America and Australia.
  18: BI loss is not negligible in global flood risk estimation. BI loss tends to
    be greater in river basins with mild slopes and long inundation periods. BI loss
    will increase in river basins with high FPL if flood magnitudes increase.
Methodology:
  1: Global river and inundation model driven by a bias-corrected meteorological forcing
    scheme used to estimate BI loss and asset damage.
  2: The study expands on an existing modeling framework, using bias-corrected meteorological
    forcing data (S14FD) to simulate daily inundation depth and estimate asset damage
    and BI loss across global river basins.
  3: Uses bias-corrected meteorological forcing data, the MATSIRO land surface model,
    CaMa-Flood inundation model, damage-depth functions, asset coefficients, GDP ratio
    of secondary and tertiary industry, and inundation period to estimate BI loss
    and asset damage.
  4: Asset damage determined using current land use data from GLCNMO v2 and aggregated
    with national mask data from GRUMPv1.
  5: Gridded GDP is derived according to the weighted distribution of country GDP
    with respect to building height data at finer resolution; Relationship between
    building height and gridded GDP is developed using data from 11 countries with
    subnational data, then applied globally
  6: "g_GDP is calculated from the ratio of gridded building height to total building\
    \ height within the country (g_bldratio) using the formula g_GDP = (0.9634 \xD7\
    \ g_bldratio + 0.0011) \xD7 country GDP. For secondary and tertiary industries,\
    \ GDP ratios were derived by subtracting the percentage of primary industry GDP\
    \ (from 2010 World Bank data) from 1."
  7: BI loss is calculated using inundation period, GDP data, and a proportional constant
    for the BI period derived from surveys of past floods.
  8: Asset damage is calculated by multiplying asset value (derived from GDP and an
    asset coefficient) by a damage fraction (derived from a damage-depth function
    incorporating diverse regions and sectors). Validation is performed using EM-DAT
    and World Bank data.
  9: Reanalysis simulation using S14FD-Reanalysis forcing dataset and past GDP data
    (1960-2013); GCM simulation using S14FD-GCM datasets (historical 1961-2005, future
    RCP8.5 2006-2098) and GDP data (historical, future SSP3) to estimate flood impacts;
    Comparison of simulated asset damage and BI loss to reported values to validate
    the method.
  10: Asset damage estimation based on river basin drainage area and flood events;
    Comparison with previous studies for validation
  11: Calculated BI loss as a percentage of GDP for each basin to remove the effects
    of economic scale; Projected future BI loss and asset damage using bias-corrected
    S14FD-GCM forcing data, S14FD-Reanalysis data, and output from CaMa-Flood driven
    by S14FD-GCM; Used average values produced by five GCMs.
  12: "Analysis is based on GCM simulations comparing historical data (1961\u2013\
    2005) to future projections (2021\u20132050 and 2061\u20132090) with validation\
    \ against reanalysis data."
  13: GCM (Global Climate Model) simulation results for specified time periods (1971-2000,
    2021-2050, 2061-2090)
  14: Reanalysis simulation results are used to compare the relative impacts of BI
    loss and asset damage on regional economies.
  15: Reanalysis simulation with and without flood protection to estimate BI loss
    and asset damage from 1960 to 2013; Comparison of BI loss estimates with and without
    flood protection at regional and global scales.
  16: The analysis uses annual averaged reanalysis simulation values to derive the
    data. The effect of flood protection is assessed by comparing outcomes with and
    without it, focusing on four river basins (Yangtze, St. Lawrence, Senegal, and
    Niger) with different FPLs. The number of floods is defined as the number of years
    where the maximum inundation depth exceeded the flood protection level.
  18: Developed a method to estimate flooding-related BI loss on a global scale. Historical
    simulation of the ratio of BI loss to asset damage, and future projections under
    RCP8.5 and SSP3 scenarios, averaging results over specified time intervals (1971-2000
    and 2061-2090).

    of flood protection standards (FLOPROS); methodology for estimating business interruption
    loss caused by flood disasters; Physically based description of floodplain inundation
    dynamics in a global river routing model.
More Notes:
  1: BI loss tends to be greater in river basins with mild slopes and long inundation
    periods, such as the Amazon.
  2: The study does not estimate high-order propagation effects.
  3: The model incorporates flood protection standards and GDP data in its calculations.
  5: National GDP data from World Bank Open Data is used for 1960-2013 (past) and
    2014-2100 (future, SSP3).
  8: The paper uses a damage-depth function from Huizinga et al. to derive the damage
    fraction, classifying regions based on World Bank and Dottori et al. classifications.
  9: Losses are converted to USD (2005 PPP) to match the currency of estimated BI
    loss, but this conversion was difficult because of missing data; Used the ratio
    of estimated loss with respect to the nominal GDP for each country and multiplied
    the result by GDP (2005 PPP).
  10: "The study compares its results to Ward et al. [15] and Alfieri et al. [3] for\
    \ validation. Shows spatial distribution of annual BI loss and BI loss per GDP\
    \ averaged from 1960 to 2013 according to river basin drainage area (\u226510,000\
    \ km2)."
  11: "The analysis uses 2005 PPP for BI loss figures; The study considers river basins\
    \ with drainage area \u2265 10,000 km2; Asset damage is considered alongside BI\
    \ loss."
  12: The study indicates greater variability and uncertainty in long-term projections,
    emphasizing the challenges in predicting future impacts of climate change.
  13: "PPP refers to Purchasing Power Parity. The analysis targets river basins with\
    \ area \u2265 10,000 km2."
  14: The study defines BI loss as loss related to business interruption caused only
    by floods, potentially leading to underestimation.
  15: The percentage of BI loss to asset damage exceeded 100% in some areas, indicating
    that its influence on economic damage cannot be ignored in flood risk estimation
    for these areas; The impact of flood protection on BI loss is greater than its
    impact on asset damage.
  16: The effectiveness of flood protection varies depending on the FPL. In some cases,
    flood protection may delay inundation without preventing it, leading to a decrease
    only in the ratio of BI loss to asset damage rather than a reduction in the number
    of floods.
  17: The figure 8 shows the relationship between the number of floods exceeding flood
    protection and the BI loss to asset damage. Figure 9 (world map) displays a color-coded
    representation of BI loss / asset damage (%) across different regions.
  18: Estimation values might remain in the scope of first-order estimation due to
    model, dataset, and method uncertainties. Improvements are needed on the estimation
    method of the business interruption period and the spatial distribution of assets.
