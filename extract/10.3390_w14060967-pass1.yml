Drivers of Risk:
  1: River floods, influenced by global warming and socioeconomic changes.
  3: Floods, specifically inundation exceeding local flood protection standards.
  4: The primary driver of risk is flooding, influenced by factors like river discharge,
    water depth, and flood extent. The analysis uses meteorological forcing datasets
    (S14FD-Reanalysis and S14FD-GCM) derived from reanalysis and GCM outputs to simulate
    runoff and subsequent flooding.
  5: Flood damage estimation requires gridded GDP data.
  7: The primary driver of risk is inundation period and annual maximum inundation
    depth.
  8: Annual maximum inundation depth from floods.
  9: Heavy rainfalls/floods.
  10: Floods are the primary driver of business interruption losses.
  11: Floods, prolonged inundation periods due to shallow slopes, high GDP (leading
    to high absolute BI loss).
  13: The driver of risk is river flooding.
  14: Floods are the primary driver of risk, causing business interruption.
  15: Floods are the primary driver of risk examined.
  16: Floods are the primary driver of risk, with the analysis examining the impact
    of flood protection levels.
  17: Floods are identified as a key driver impacting the outcomes of business interruption
    losses and asset damage.
  21: Flooding and associated impacts due to climate change.

    a percentage of GDP, and asset damage.
  13: BI loss (Business Interruption loss) and asset damage are the outcomes being
    evaluated in terms of annual average (Billion USD (2005 PPP)) and annual average
    per GDP.
  14: Evaluates business interruption (BI) loss due to floods as a proxy for economic
    impact.
  15: The paper evaluates the impact of flood protection on business interruption
    (BI) loss and asset damage.
  16: This page evaluates the impact of flood protection on business interruption
    (BI) loss relative to asset damage.
  17: The page provides an overview of business interruption (BI) loss in relation
    to asset damage caused by floods across different regions.
  21: The page lists various studies focused on the assessment and measurement of
    flood risks and impacts.
Highlights:
  1: BI loss tends to be greater in river basins with mild slopes and long inundation
    periods, such as the Amazon.
  7: BI loss is defined as the loss caused by the inability of people to perform work
    due to workplace destruction or inaccessibility due to floods.
  8: Asset damage from annual maximum flood depth is estimated, considering diverse
    regions and sectors, and validated against existing databases.
  9: Estimated BI losses calculated for Namibia, Moldova, Pakistan (2011), Thailand,
    and Malawi were similar to World Bank values.
  10: The study's method of calculating asset damage is sufficiently accurate for
    global long-term averages. There are discrepancies in BI loss estimations between
    the World Bank and the study across various countries and years.
  11: High GDP can contribute to high absolute BI loss, but relative BI loss (as a
    percentage of GDP) is smaller in regions with high GDP compared to regions with
    lower GDP. River basins with shallow slopes and long inundation periods tend to
    have higher BI loss as a percentage of GDP.
  13: The percentage of BI loss relative to GDP is expected to decrease in most regions
    of South America, the Middle East, and Australia.
  14: Previous asset damage-focused studies underestimated the economic impacts of
    floods, particularly in regions where the percentage of BI loss relative to asset
    damage was high. BI loss can be a significant component of economic impact from
    floods, exceeding asset damage in some regions.
  15: Flood protection has a greater effect on reducing BI loss than in reducing asset
    damage.
  16: Flood protection has a greater effect on BI loss than on asset damage. Higher
    flood protection levels lead to a greater decrease in both the number of floods
    and the ratio of BI loss to asset damage.
  17: The analysis highlights expected increases in BI loss to asset damage ratios
    in Africa, China, India, central Africa, Europe, and America, with a noted projected
    decrease in South America and Australia.
  21: Focus on city size, urban scaling, and economic impacts of floods; highlights
    flood damage risk perception and mitigation measures.
Methodology:
  1: Global river and inundation model driven by a bias-corrected meteorological forcing
    scheme.
  3: BI loss and asset damage are calculated using flood simulations and gridded GDP
    data, with daily inundation data from a Catchment-based Macro-scale Floodplain
    (CaMa-Flood) model using bias-corrected meteorological forcing.
  4: "Flood simulations are performed using CaMa-Flood, forced by runoff data calculated\
    \ by MATSIRO. CaMa-Flood calculates river discharge, water depth, and flood extent\
    \ at a coarse resolution (0.25\xB0) and can be downscaled to a higher resolution\
    \ (30\u2033) using topography data. Meteorological data is obtained from the S14FD\
    \ reanalysis dataset (S14FD-Reanalysis) and bias-corrected global climate model\
    \ (GCM) output forcing dataset (S14FD-GCM). Urban areas are determined from the\
    \ GLCNMO v2 product."
  5: Assumed building height was proportional to GDP per capita to estimate gridded
    GDP, using data from building heights and GDP ratios.
  6: This paper estimates gridded GDP using a relationship between gridded building
    height ratio and gridded GDP ratio. It also estimates GDP ratios for secondary
    and tertiary industries based on primary industry GDP data from the World Bank.
    The analysis assumes assets are 2.8 times GDP in urban areas and equal to GDP
    in other areas.
  8: Asset value is calculated by multiplying GDP by an asset coefficient. A damage-depth
    function is used, incorporating diverse regions (Europe, North America, Central
    and South America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania) and sectors (residential, commercial,
    industrial, transport, infrastructure, and agriculture). Validation is performed
    against the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) and World Bank data on flood events.
  9: "A reanalysis simulation (S14FD-Reanalysis forcing dataset and past GDP data\
    \ for 1960\u20132013) and a GCM simulation were conducted. The GCM simulation\
    \ uses a historical S14FD-GCM (1961\u20132005) dataset and GDP data to estimate\
    \ past flood impacts, and a future S14FD-GCM dataset for RCP8.5 (2006\u20132098)\
    \ and GDP data for SSP3 to estimate future flood impacts."
  10: The study uses a methodology to estimate asset damage and BI loss. The methodology
    is validated by comparing calculated global asset damage with values obtained
    from previous studies.
  11: Projected future BI loss and asset damage using bias-corrected S14FD-GCM forcing
    data, S14FD-Reanalysis data, and output from CaMa-Flood driven by S14FD-GCM. Average
    values produced by five GCMs were used to compensate for uncertainties. Compared
    changes in the percentage of BI loss to GDP over time with changes in asset damage
    relative to GDP according to S14FD-Reanalysis and S14FD-GCM data.
  13: GCM simulation results are presented for the periods 1971-2000, 2021-2050, and
    2061-2090.
  14: The study uses reanalysis simulation results to compare the relative impacts
    of BI loss and asset damage on regional economies.
  15: The study uses reanalysis simulation results with and without flood protection
    to estimate BI loss and asset damage, averaged from 1960 to 2013.
  16: The analysis uses reanalysis simulation values to calculate BI loss, asset damage,
    and flood inundation depths. The number of floods is defined as the number of
    years where maximum inundation depth exceeds flood protection level. The methodology
    is applicable to river basins.
  21: Multi-variate flood damage assessment; decadal monitoring using MODIS optical
    data; integration of spatial and computable general equilibrium modeling.
More Notes:
  1: "Future flood risk projection under RCP8.5 and SSP3 scenarios showed increases\
    \ in BI loss and asset damage per GDP by 0.32% and 1.78% (2061\u20132090 average)\
    \ compared with a past period (1971\u20132000 average), respectively."
  4: The study uses various datasets for atmospheric, geographical, and socioeconomic
    data. The combination of CaMa-Flood and MATSIRO runoff data has been confirmed
    to reasonably simulate river discharge and water level.
  5: The relationship between subnational GDP ratios and building height ratios was
    considered linear with a specific equation.
  7: The paper acknowledges the simplistic assumption of applying a globally uniform
    constant (alpha = 2) for the BI period estimation and recommends revision with
    more data. The urban area was calculated using GLCNMO.
  8: The study uses a damage-depth function from Huizinga et al. [46] and classifies
    regions based on World Bank and Dottori et al. [47]. It averages residential,
    commercial, and industrial damage for each inundation depth and region. Table
    2 contains some information about validation events, including the year, loss
    (in USD 2005 PPP), and targeted industries in a country.
  9: Losses from EM-DAT or the World Bank are converted to USD (2005 PPP) using the
    ratio of estimated loss to nominal GDP, multiplied by GDP (2005 PPP).
  10: "Figure 3 shows the spatial distribution of annual BI loss and BI loss per GDP\
    \ averaged from 1960 to 2013 according to river basin drainage area (\u226510,000\
    \ km2)."
  11: BI loss is used as a measure of economic impact from floods.
  14: The study defines BI loss as that caused only by floods, potentially underestimating
    the total economic impact compared to studies that include indirect losses or
    losses from other factors like landslides triggered by floods.
Quantitative material:
  1: Global BI loss and asset damage estimated at USD 26.9 and 130.9 billion (2005
    PPP) (1960-2013 average), respectively.
  6: "The paper obtained a maximum correlation coefficient of 0.91 between gridded\
    \ GDP and building height for a lower building height limit of 6.0 m. It uses\
    \ the equation g_GDP = (0.9634 \xD7 g_bldratio + 0.0011) \xD7 country GDP to estimate\
    \ gridded GDP."
  7: Presents equations for calculating BI loss, BIP (BI period), using inundation
    period (IP), annual production (AP), and number of days per year (Nd). Mentions
    the proportional constant alpha relating IP and BIP, using a value of 2.
  8: Damage is calculated through the multiplication of asset value by the fraction
    of assets with flood-related damage. Validation data from EM-DAT and World Bank
    data.
  9: Globally, annual total BI loss and asset damage averaged from 1960 to 2013 were
    estimated to be USD 26.9 and 130.9 billion (2005 PPP), respectively, in the reanalysis
    simulation.
  10: Annual global asset damage estimated at USD 96 billion (2005 PPP) averaged from
    1960 to 1999. Annual global asset damage estimated at USD 56.7 billion (2005 PPP)
    for targeted river basins with drainage area > 5000 km2 averaged from 1976 to
    2005.
  11: BI loss exceeded USD 50 million (2005 PPP) in drainage areas of America and
    Europe, as well as the Tigris, Euphrates, Chao Phraya, and Yellow Rivers. BI loss
    was USD < 1 million (2005 PPP) in most parts of South America and Africa. The
    Amazon, Congo, Shebelle, Niger, Indus, Diamantina and Chao Phraya River basins
    had values > 0.3% of GDP (i.e., more than double the global average of 0.12%).
    America and Europe showed a relative BI loss of <0.1% of GDP.
  13: The average percentage of BI loss relative to GDP in targeted river basins was
    0.81% during 1971-2000.
  14: Globally, the ratio of BI loss to asset damage averaged from 1960 to 2013 was
    20.6%. This value was highest in African regions (22.1%) and Europe (26.9%), while
    it was lowest in South America (6.1%).
  15: The ratio of BI loss to asset damage decreased by an average of 30% with flood
    protection compared to without.
  17: Quantitative data includes projections of BI loss to asset damage ratios exceeding
    15% in Africa and increasing by 17.3% in the Mississippi River basin, relative
    to past values.
  21: Increased human and economic losses from river flooding with anthropogenic warming.
