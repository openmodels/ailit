Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate risk (as measured by a climate risk index).
  6: Climate risk index.
  7: Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), Political Stability Index (PSI), Financial
    Freedom Index (FFI); Implicitly, climate risks are considered drivers of risk
    as the paper attempts to assess their impact on the economy.
  8: Extreme weather events (storms, floods, and heat waves) as captured by the Climate
    Risk Index (CRI), which includes direct economic losses as a share of GDP and
    the number of deaths.
  9: Climate Risk Index (CRI).
  10: Climate risk (implicitly included as one of the explanatory factors in the competitiveness
    analysis), macroeconomic factors such as economic growth, inflation rate, control
    of corruption, political stability, and financial freedom.
  12: Climate risk.
  13: Climate risk
Highlights:
  2: Climate risks negatively affect stock market capitalization. Climate risk increases
    sovereign risk when sovereign risk is already low. Climate risk has a small impact
    on competitivity.
  6: The study aims to identify at what levels of the stock market capitalization
    or sovereign risk, the impact of climate risk is statistically significant, using
    quantiles regression.
  8: The Climate Risk Index (CRI) is stationary, meaning it can be used in regression
    analysis without causing spurious results.
  9: Climate Risk Index (CRI) is independent of other explanatory factors included
    in the analysis (GDP, inflation, unemployment).
  10: Sovereign CDS influenced by macroeconomic factors such as economic growth, inflation
    rate, control of corruption, political stability, and financial freedom.
  12: Increasing climate risk has a negative impact on stock market capitalization,
    particularly across the 25th to 75th quantiles. The impact is not significant
    for countries with very low or very high market capitalization. Traders' expectations
    about stock market transactions are influenced by their perception of climate
    risk. Climate risk impacts a country's ability to deliver goods and services to
    competitive markets (national competitiveness).
  13: Climate risk has a negative but statistically insignificant correlation with
    a country's global competitiveness (i.e., probability of being in the top 25%).
    Climate risk does not strongly impact countries with low or very high levels of
    market capitalization. Climate risk leads to increased country risk, only in cases
    of low budget deficit.
Methodology:
  1: Panel data approach
  2: Panel data approach using quantile and logistic regression on a sample of 22
    countries (16 EU members and 6 OECD members) during the 2008-2019 period.
  6: Quantiles regression and LOGIT regression. Quantiles regression is novel to the
    field.
  7: Panel data approach using econometric methods on a sample of 22 EU and OECD countries
    from 2008 to 2019.
  8: The study uses stationary variables in an empirical analysis. The Levin, Lin
    and Chu (2002) test is used to test for stationarity. The analysis uses a correlation
    matrix and Variance Influence Factor (VIF) to check for multicollinearity.
  9: Panel data approach, quantile regression for panel data. Quantile regression
    is used when the dependent variable has an asymmetric distribution or when explaining
    values in the tails of the distribution.
  10: Logistic regression (LOGIT model) to identify determinants of competitiveness
    and the extent to which climate risk influences its level. Quantile regression
    to analyze the determinants of sovereign CDS.
  12: Quantile regression is used to assess the impact of climate risk on stock market
    capitalization. A LOGIT model is used to assess the impact of climate risk on
    competitiveness.
  13: Panel data approach is used to assess the impact of climate risk on the economy;
    Quantile regressions are used to analyze the effect of market capitalization on
    climate risks; Logistic regression is used to highlight the impact of climate
    risk on the global competitiveness of a country.
More Notes:
  1: The paper assesses climate risk impact on the economy but this page only provides
    bibliographic information. The full article would need to be reviewed to extract
    specific findings.
  2: The study considers the influence of the European Green Pact and standardization
    of the global price of CO2 on competitiveness.
  6: Data limitations led to the elimination of some countries from the study, but
    the sample size is considered consistent and able to generate reliable estimates.
    The study selects countries with statistical data on the climate risk index and
    adds economic and financial variables used in previous studies. The working methods
    are chosen to provide a persuasive picture of the interactions between climate
    risk and dependent variables.
  7: The paper focuses on the assessment of climate risk impact on the economy, but
    this page primarily describes the data used in the analysis. The paper uses a
    set of economic, social and political variables to represent the impacts of climate
    risks, which are not explicitly listed here, but implied to be relevant to the
    selected countries.
  8: The study aims to analyze the financial and competition implications of the EU's
    Green Deal, but this page focuses on the statistical properties of the variables
    used in the analysis, specifically the Climate Risk Index.
  9: The study investigates the impact of climate risk on sovereign risk, the capital
    market, and the degree of competitiveness in a given country.
  10: The paper uses a binary variable for competitiveness (top 25% vs. below). The
    quantile regression analysis of CDS considers different quantiles to represent
    low vs. high sovereign risk environments.
  12: The impact of climate risk on market capitalization is monotonically decreasing
    from the 25th to the 90th quantile.
  13: The study identifies the inability to accurately estimate the impact of climate
    change on sovereign risk in all countries or those with high sovereign risk as
    a limitation. The study proposes developing an indicator to allow significant
    assessment of the impact of climate risk at the level of competitiveness.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Sovereign risk (CDS level), stock market capitalization as a percentage of GDP,
    and global competitivity.
  6: Stock market capitalization, sovereign risk, and competitiveness.
  7: Sovereign Risk (CDS), Stock market capitalisation as percentage of GDP (MC),
    Global competitiveness (GCI), GDP per capita (GDPc), Inflation rate (INF), Unemployment
    rate (UNE)
  9: Sovereign CDS (credit default swaps, related to sovereign risk), Stock market
    capitalization, GDP, inflation, unemployment.
  10: Competitiveness index of a country and sovereign CDS (Credit Default Swaps)
    as a measure of sovereign risk.
  12: Stock market capitalization; National competitiveness (ability of countries
    to deliver goods and services to competitive markets).
  13: Global competitiveness of a country; Market capitalization; Sovereign risk;
    Country risk; Budget deficit
Quantitative material:
  1: Vol. 24, Iss. 61, pp. 597-612
  2: Negative relationship between climate risks and the evolution of stock market
    capitalization as a percentage of GDP. Climate risk leads to an increase in sovereign
    risk only across inferior quantiles (when the CDS level is small). Level of competitiveness
    of a country is influenced to a small extent by the level of climate risk.
  6: Sample of 263 observations used for analysis.
  7: The study uses panel data from 22 EU and OECD countries over 12 years (2008-2019).
    CDS quotations are computed as the annual average of the credit quality. GCI is
    a dummy variable equal to 1 if a country in a certain year ranks in the top 25%
    of the considered economies.
  9: Correlation matrix showing correlations between GDPc, INF, UNE, CPI, PSI, FFI,
    and CRI.
  10: Results of quantile regression on sovereign CDS (Table no. 4).
  12: Figure no. 1 shows quantile estimates for climate risk on market capitalization,
    with values ranging from 0 to -0.006. Table 6 presents LOGIT estimates with coefficients
    for various variables including GDPc (0.00002), INF (0.03697), UNE (0.16519***),
    COR (0.13538***), POL (-1.26508**), FINF (-0.06868), and CRI (-0.00524).
  13: A negative coefficient of -0.00524 is found, suggesting that an increase in
    climate risk reduces the probability that a country will enter the top 25% of
    countries depending on the level of global competitiveness. The C coefficient
    is -7.32689***, and the McFadden R2 is 0.1287.
