  3: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Wind storms, extreme waves, high and low sea levels, ice ridging, heavy precipitation,
    sea-effect snowfall, river floods, heat waves, ice seasons, drought, phytoplankton
    blooms, forest fires, and climate change.
  15: No relevant information
  16: 'Increased river flood risks due to global warming and changes in the water
    cycle; Factors affecting spring flood scale: precipitation, snow-water accumulation,
    depth of frozen soil, soil wetness, presence of ice crust, and flood wave combination.'
  17: Increasing trends in warm spell duration index (WSDI) and cold spell duration
    index (CSDI); Changes in streamflow patterns (increasing in winter, decreasing
    in spring for east Baltic states); Shift in flood timing from late March to February
    due to earlier snowmelt.
  20: Sea ice ridging and compression events due to specific weather patterns (cold,
    calm followed by cyclone and strong winds), negative NAO.
  21: Anthropogenic eutrophication causing excessive phytoplankton blooms.
  23: Climate change, particularly long-lasting drought events and heat waves, increases
    the probability of large forest fires.
  25: Sea level rise, extreme coastal water levels, high water levels in nearby rivers,
    high-intensity rainfall (compound events), storms impacting offshore wind energy
    activities.
  26: Extreme water levels/coastal flooding related to climate change.
  27: Changes in extreme events (ice conditions) and natural disasters.
  30: Natural hazards and extreme events like storms, heavy precipitation, heat waves,
    cold spells, cyclones, blocking situations, marine heat waves, and compound events.
  33: Climate change is contributing to the prolongation of the phytoplankton growing
    season, and it affects the likelihood of events such as drought, forest fires,
    heat waves, and coastal flooding.
Highlights:
  1: Natural hazards related to climate change are identified as one of the Grand
    Challenges in the Baltic Sea region; significant knowledge gaps are identified,
    including the response of large-scale atmospheric circulation to climate change,
    marine heat waves, and small-scale variability in precipitation; changes are expected
    for sea level, extreme precipitation, heat waves and phytoplankton blooms (increase),
    and cold spells and severe ice winters (decrease).
  15: No relevant information
  16: Wintertime precipitation amounts are increasing, extending the period for convective
    snow band formation. Conditions for sea-effect snowfall might become less favorable
    due to a shorter thermal winter and a smaller share of snowfall compared with
    rain in a warming climate.
  17: Increasing trends in warm spell duration and slight increases in cold spell
    duration; shift in flood occurrence to earlier in the year.
  20: Sea ice compression and ridging can cause total stoppage or damage to ships,
    leading to economic disruption through halted marine traffic and increased shipping
    costs.
  23: The forest-fire danger is generally projected to increase across the circumboreal
    region due to enhanced evaporation in a warmer climate.
  25: Denmark is expected to suffer the most severe damage from increased coastal
    flooding resulting from climate change due to its long coastline, followed by
    Germany, Poland, and Sweden.
  26: Damage costs from coastal flooding are projected to increase significantly by
    2100 in the Baltic Sea region. Copenhagen consistently shows the highest projected
    costs.
  27: The difference in estimations of design parameters (more than 10%) is bigger
    than the effect from climate change calculated from different climate scenarios
    (a few percentage points).
  30: Analysis focused on understanding extreme events in the Baltic Sea region and
    their connections to atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrological conditions.
  33: Increased risk of forest fires, drought, and heat waves throughout this century;
    increased exposure and damage from coastal flooding expected.
Methodology:
  1: Summarizes existing knowledge about extreme events in the Baltic Sea region over
    the past 200 years and future climate scenarios.
  3: The paper reviews available published scientific knowledge on climatic, environmental,
    and human-induced changes in the Baltic Sea region. It focuses on the past and
    present conditions, relying on in situ measurements up to the last 200 years.
  15: Simulations using EURO-CORDEX RCP8.5 scenario data; results pertain to changes
    in return values of precipitation from 1971-2000 to 2071-2100.
  16: Case study using high-resolution ERA5 data for January 2016 to analyze sea-effect
    snowfalls. Preliminary results were promising regarding the use of reanalysis
    data over sea, but the data cannot produce intensive enough convective snowfall
    over land. Newly developed convection-permitting regional climate models are being
    used to assess future probability of events.
  17: Analysis based on wsdiETCCDI and csdiETCCDI data (Cornes et al., 2018) generated
    by climind 1.0.0 on 19 November 2019; fitting curves and linear fits to time series
    data.
  25: Macroscale damage cost curves are calculated as a function of flood height for
    the 600 largest cities in Europe using land use information instead of population
    coupled with GDP per capita, along with a high-resolution digital elevation model
    and a simple static-inundation model.
  26: Uses the MIUU mesoscale model to calculate 10min mean and 3s gust values, with
    a grid space of 1km. Also mentions the HIRHAM model. The time frame is 2050 and
    2100.
  27: Development of approaches for calculating design parameters over the Baltic
    Sea.
  30: Combination of observational data, higher-resolution climate models, machine
    learning, and neural networks to understand risks and return periods of rare and
    compound events.
More Notes:
  1: Focuses on the Baltic Sea region.
  3: The paper focuses on the Baltic Sea region, which may limit the generalizability
    of its findings to other national contexts. The study acknowledges data limitations,
    especially for long-term trends and extreme events.
  15: The page primarily discusses changes in precipitation patterns and snow events
    in the Baltic Sea region, not macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  16: The page primarily discusses the impact of climate change on river floods and
    sea-effect snowfalls in the Baltic Sea region. It highlights the complex interplay
    of various factors influencing flood risks and snowfall patterns. The radar image
    depicts a specific snowfall event in Finland.
  17: The paper focuses on hydrological changes and extreme events in the Baltic Sea
    region, which may indirectly impact macroeconomic and fiscal outcomes, but it
    does not directly quantify those impacts.
  25: Impacts due to compound events are largely unaccounted for in most damage cost
    assessments. The methodology used to assess flood damage can lead to an overestimation
    of damage costs, especially for low-lying urban and high-value areas.
  26: The damage cost estimates are based on modeling of flood events and their economic
    impact. The analysis includes several Baltic cities and countries.
  27: The page discusses the development of wind farms in the Baltic and North Sea
    regions, but does not directly link this development to macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes, although reliable designs are needed given risk.
