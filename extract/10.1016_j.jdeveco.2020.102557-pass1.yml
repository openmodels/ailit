    and above a threshold. Also includes effects of precipitation, sunshine duration,
    relative humidity, and wind speed.

    to climate change, Greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration pathways (RCPs) including
    RCP2.6 and RCP8.5
  12: Future warming (climate change) and extreme hot weather.

Highlights:
  1: "Extreme heat has negative effects on China\u2019s agricultural TFP and input\
    \ utilization, which results in a more negative effect on agricultural output.\
    \ Longer-run adaptation has offset 37.9% of the short-run effects of extreme heat\
    \ exposure on TFP. Projections of impacts under future climate change scenarios\
    \ still imply a substantial loss in China\u2019s agriculture."
  2: Extreme heat exposure negatively impacts agricultural TFPs and yield. Farmers
    do implement long-run adaptations which can help offset some of these impacts.
    The impacts on TFP and yield are evaluated separately, with a focus on the role
    of input utilization in adaptation.
  3: Climate change has a significant negative impact on China's agricultural productivity;
    early mitigation actions result in better policy effects.
  4: Climate change has negative impacts on labor and fertilizer utilization in the
    short run, but no significant impact on capital stock. It has a negative impact
    on TFP and a more negative impact on yield in the short run. Expect adaptations
    to exist in all three inputs in the long run, and the adaptation in yield is greater
    than the adaptation in TFP.
  5: "Climate adaptation is observed if the short-run effect is offset in the long\
    \ run. A piecewise linear approach is preferred to evaluate the short-run effect\
    \ of climate change on agricultural TFP, yield, and input utilization. The value\
    \ 1 - (\u03B2_LD2 / \u03B2_FE2) can be interpreted as the overall negative short-run\
    \ effect that is compensated in the long run, which is their estimation of adaptation\
    \ to extreme heat."
  6: "Exposure to GDD (Growing Degree Days) below 33\xB0C slightly promotes agricultural\
    \ TFP, but GDD above 33\xB0C leads to a sharp decrease in agricultural TFP. There\
    \ is a nonlinear, inverse U-shaped effect of temperature on agricultural TFP,\
    \ with the turning point around 33\xB0C."
  8: Extreme heating has a 71% larger negative impact on yield compared to agricultural
    TFP.
  9: Extreme heat negatively impacts agricultural TFP and yield, but longer-run adaptation
    partially offsets these negative impacts.
  10: Higher temperatures (GDD above threshold) have a statistically significant positive
    impact on Agricultural TFP and Yield in China. Adaptation measures offset a significant
    portion of the negative short-run impacts of higher temperatures, with estimates
    ranging from 37.89% to 64.36% depending on the input or output measure.
  11: Future global warming will significantly lower China's agricultural TFP and
    Yield. Climate adaptation offsets a portion of these reductions, but the offset
    shrinks in the long run. Impact on yield is more negative than on TFP due to the
    impact of climate change on input utilization (labor, fertilizer, machinery).
  12: Future warming is projected to negatively impact China's agricultural productivity.
    The negative impact of extreme hot weather on labor and fertilizer usage contributes
    to the difference between the impact on TFP and yield. Long-run adaptation decreases
    relative to the medium term, suggesting limited adaptations without new policy
    interventions.
  13: Adaptations in agricultural TFP and input portfolio significantly reduce short-run
    negative yield impacts; future warming still poses risks.
  14: "Negative impact on agricultural TFP is more pronounced at higher temperature\
    \ thresholds (above 33\xB0C), e.g., significant declines in log TFP for GDD above\
    \ 40\xB0C."
  15: Increasing GDD above thresholds significantly affects Agricultural TFP, yield
    and input use. There is a significant adaptation affect.
  16: Adaptations offset significant portions of the impact of GDD above threshold.
    The paper measures agricultural TFP, Yield, and inputs like labor, fertilizer
    and machinery as outcomes of interest.
Methodology:
  1: Using a county-panel dataset spanning the past 35 years, the paper evaluates
    the impact of global warming on agricultural TFP as well as the impacts on agricultural
    inputs and outputs in China; Stochastic frontier analysis.
  2: Panel regressions and long differences approaches are used to estimate the impact
    of climate change on agricultural TFPs and yield in China from 1981-2015. The
    analysis considers non-linear relationships between agricultural TFPs and weather
    variables.
  3: Analysis uses a Cobb-Douglas production function and econometric model to study
    the impact of climate change on agricultural TFP over a 35-year period at the
    county level in China.
  4: Stochastic frontier analysis, panel approach, long differences approach. The
    panel approach is used to estimate the short-run impacts of global warming. The
    long differences approach is used to estimate long-run impacts. Uses a Cobb-Douglas
    stochastic frontier model and Transcendental Logarithmic stochastic frontier model.
  5: Uses temperature bin approach and piecewise linear approach to model the impact
    of temperature on agricultural outcomes. Employs long differences approach and
    panel long differences approach to estimate the impact of long-run climate changes
    on agricultural outcomes. Quantifies adaptation by comparing short-run impacts
    from panel estimates with long-run impacts from long differences estimates.
  6: Piecewise linear approach and traditional temperature bins approach using county-level
    panel data from 1981-2015.
  8: Panel and long differences approach used for estimating impacts of temperature
    on agricultural TFP and yield, based on data from 1981-2015 in China.
  9: Panel data estimation with fixed effects, long difference estimations as robustness
    checks, piecewise linear function to estimate changes in log agricultural TFP
    under additional temperature exposure. Spatial correlation and clustering at the
    county level are accounted for in standard errors. Inverse distance weighting
    (IDW) is used to estimate weather conditions for counties using weather station
    data.
  10: Panel data analysis with county and year fixed effects, and long difference
    estimations with 5-year differencing periods, are used to estimate the impacts.
    Spatial correlation is accounted for by clustering standard errors at the county
    level. Bootstrap procedure is also used to quantify the uncertainty of climate
    adaptation.
  11: The study uses estimated coefficients of GDD below and above threshold to project
    the impact of future global warming on agricultural TFP in China, using climate
    projections from WorldClim-Global Climate Data under four RCPs for medium (2041-2060)
    and long term (2061-2080). Climate data is derived from global climate models
    HadGEM2-ES and NorESM1-M.  Percentage of short-run impacts offset by adaptation
    is calculated using bootstrap estimates.
  12: "Uses county-year panel data for 2495 counties over the period of 1981\u2013\
    2015, long differences and panel estimates of historical sensitivities to climate,\
    \ and climate models (HadGEM2-ES and NorESM1-M) to project future impacts on agricultural\
    \ TFP and yield in China; CD-SFA-w/CRS model for agricultural TFP."
  13: Analysis based on adaptation behaviors in TFP and inputs, with a focus on agricultural
    productivity.
  14: Annual panel regression with county and year fixed effects, considering temperature
    thresholds and additional weather variables, and clustering standard errors at
    the county level.
  15: The analysis uses piecewise linear approach. Long difference estimates and panel
    data estimates are used to assess the impact of temperature on agricultural outcomes
    in China. CD-SFA-w/CRS, TL-SFA-w/CRS, CD-SFA-w/oCRS, C-D (CPF) models are used.
    Spatial correlation-adjusted standard errors clustered at the county level are
    used.
  16: "Panel and long difference regressions; estimated using long difference with\
    \ 5-year lengths of differencing period; Regressions are weighted by 1981\u2013\
    2015 county-average farm area; Standard errors adjusted for spatial correlation\
    \ and clustered at county level; Bootstrap estimates of (1-\u03B2 2LD/\u03B2 2FE)\
    \ /C2 100% are provided."

  10: The paper focuses on the agricultural sector in China. The adaptation percentages
    are calculated based on the difference between panel estimates and long-difference
