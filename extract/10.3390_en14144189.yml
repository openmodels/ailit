Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme climate risks (floods, droughts, tornados, hurricanes, etc.), business
    cycle fluctuations, and oil price fluctuations.
  3: Climate risks and external shocks like economic recession and falling oil prices
    impact energy consumption transition.
  4: Climate risk (CRI), measured by the Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index Report
    (GCRIR). Higher CRI reflects higher levels of climate risks.
  5: Extreme weather events (measured by the Global Climate Risk Index)
  6: Climate risk (both short-term and long-term) impacts energy consumption structure.
  7: Changes in energy consumption structure
  8: Climate risk (CRI and CRI_long, short-term and long-term climate risks respectively).
  9: Short-term climate risk (CRI) and Long-term climate risk (CRI_long)
  10: Climate risk (CRI and CRI_long, which represents long-term weather conditions)
  11: Countries with high regulatory governance can adopt efficient energy policies
    to weaken the link between climate risk and energy consumption.
  12: Climate risk (CRI and CRI_long), measured by losses caused by extreme weather
    events.
  13: Short-term and long-term climate risk (CRI and CRI_long), resource endowment
    (resource-rich vs. resource-poor), and level of economic development (high vs.
    low).
  14: Climate risk impacts energy consumption transition; business cycle fluctuations
    impact the relationship between climate risk and energy consumption.
  15: Extreme climate events such as floods, heatwaves, and long-term droughts are
    driving changes in energy consumption behavior.
Highlights:
  1: Extreme climate change has promoted the transition of the energy structure, reduced
    the consumption of fossil energy, and increased the consumption of renewable energy.
    The impact of extreme climate risks on energy transition is heterogeneous, with
    areas with high levels of economic development and coastal countries more inclined
    to respond to climate change through energy transition. Economic recession and
    falling oil prices will strengthen the correlation between climate risk and the
    global energy transition.
  3: Governance quality promotes renewable energy consumption; countries with abundant
    resources benefit from short-term climate risks, whereas those with insufficient
    resources face stronger long-term transition pressures.
  4: 'Climate risk has a negative impact on energy consumption transition (negative
    correlation). The impact of climate risk on energy consumption transition is moderated
    by governance quality. Hypotheses: H2a - weakened impact with high governance;
    H2b - strengthened impact with high governance.'
  5: The study investigates the moderating effects of governance quality on the relationship
    between climate risk and energy consumption transition.
  6: Coastal and Pacific Rim countries such as Australia, India, the United States,
    and China face higher climate risks. Climate risks were highest in 2008 and lowest
    in 2015. Global renewable energy consumption remains low.
  8: Climate risk (both short-term and long-term) significantly promotes the transition
    of energy consumption.
  9: Both short-term and long-term climate risk have a significantly positive impact
    on energy consumption transition (ECT), suggesting that climate risk promotes
    the shift towards renewable energy consumption. The impact of climate risk on
    energy consumption transition is long-term and dynamic.
  10: Climate risks significantly reduce fossil energy consumption (oil, coal, and
    gas).  The effect of climate risk on promoting energy consumption transition is
    weakened in countries with higher governance quality.
  11: Strong governance, including political stability, regulatory quality, legal
    systems, and corruption control, helps in reducing the negative impact of climate
    risk on energy policy.
  12: Climate risk can promote the transition of energy consumption (ECT).
  13: Short-term climate risk (CRI) has a significantly positive impact on energy
    consumption transition in resource-rich countries, but not in resource-poor countries.
    Long-term climate risks (CRI_long) have a significantly positive impact on energy
    consumption transition in both resource-rich and resource-poor countries. Short-term
    climate risk (CRI) has a significantly positive impact on energy consumption transition
    in countries with low levels of economic development, but not in those with high
    levels of economic development. Long-term climate risks (CRI_long) has a significantly
    positive impact on energy consumption transition in countries with low levels
    of economic development, but not in those with high levels of economic development
    (in fact it has a negative impact).
  14: Climate risk can promote energy consumption transition in low-income countries
    and during economic recessions; falling oil prices enhance the positive impact
    of climate risk on energy transition.
  15: Countries with significant climate risks and lower economic development are
    more inclined towards renewable energy; economic recessions and falling oil prices
    strengthen this trend.
Methodology:
  1: A panel data model with fixed effects is used to analyze the heterogeneous impacts
    of extreme climate risks on global consumption transition.
  3: The study analyzes empirical results to evaluate the impact of climate risks
    on energy consumption transition through governance quality and international
    differences.
  4: Spatial panel model with fixed effects is used to estimate the relationship between
    climate risk and energy consumption transition, controlling for GDP per capita,
    urbanization rate, industrial structure, and trade openness.
  5: 'Panel data model (Equation 2) analyzing the relationship between climate risk,
    governance, and energy consumption transition, controlling for economic growth,
    urbanization, industrial structure, and trade activity.  The model includes an
    interaction term between Climate Risk Index (CRI) and Governance (GOV) to assess
    conditional benefits. Six classification indicators of WGI into the model are:
    voice and accountability (vae), political stability and absence of violence (pve),
    government effectiveness (gee), regulatory quality (rqe), rule of law (rle), and
    control of corruption (cce).'
  6: Panel data analysis using a dataset of 101 countries/regions from 2006 to 2019.
    ADF-Fisher test to check stability of variables.
  8: Panel data analysis using ADF-Fisher test for unit root, Pearson correlation
    analysis, and regression analysis (mentioned in section 4, results in Table 4,
    but not shown on this page).
  9: Panel data regression with country and year fixed effects. The Hausman test suggests
    fixed effects model is preferred. Independent variables include climate risk indices
    (short and long term, lagged), GDP per capita (lnpgdp), urbanization rate (urbanr),
    industrialization rate (indusr), and trade (trader).
  10: Regression analysis with country and year fixed effects is used to estimate
    the effect of climate risk on fossil energy consumption.  The analysis appears
    to be panel data as evidenced by the FE. Interaction terms between climate risk
    and governance indicators are also used.
  11: The analysis employs estimation of moderating effects of governance quality
    on energy policy measures.
  12: Instrumental variable method is used to address endogeneity, with coastline
    length (lncoastline) as the instrument for climate risk. The first stage regresses
    climate risk on coastline length, and the fitted value of climate risk is incorporated
    into the second stage regression where ECT is the dependent variable. Country
    and year fixed effects are included.
  13: Panel data analysis with country and year fixed effects, examining the heterogeneous
    impact of climate risk on energy consumption transition based on resource endowment
    and economic development level.
  14: The analysis uses sub-sample grouping by economic development level, time periods
    based on economic cycle (boom and recession), and oil price fluctuation cycles
    for respective evaluations.
  15: The study uses annual country-level data from 101 countries (2006-2019) and
    employs an instrumental variable method to address potential endogeneity and assess
    robustness.
More Notes:
  1: The climate risk index constructed by Germanwatch is used as a measure of climate
    risk.
  3: Countries with lower economic development show a significant impact of climate
    risks on energy transition.
  6: The study uses the proportion of renewable energy consumption (ECT) to reflect
    the level of energy consumption transition.
  7: The page presents a climate risk index and its relationship with energy consumption
    structure. Without more information, the relevance to specific macroeconomic/fiscal
    outcomes or adaptation costs/benefits is unclear.
  8: The study defines energy consumption transition as increasing the share of renewable
    energy consumption. The long-term climate risk has a higher promotion effect on
    energy consumption transition than short-term climate risk. The paper uses control
    variables like GDP, urbanization rate, industrialization rate, and trade openness.
  9: The paper also analyzes the impact of climate risk on fossil energy consumption
    (Table 5, mentioned but not shown on this page), finding a negative relationship.
    Higher levels of urbanization, industrialization, and foreign trade are associated
    with lower energy consumption transition (ECT).
  10: Governance quality moderates the relationship between climate risk and energy
    consumption transition. The paper finds that in countries with better governance,
    the transition to alternative energy sources is driven more by comprehensive economic
    and social development goals than by short-term climate risk considerations.
  11: Governance quality directly affects energy consumption transition, with strong
    governance enabling better formulation of energy transition policies.
  12: The dependent variable is 'energy consumption transition' (ECT), which is not
    clearly defined on this page.
  13: The study uses the median of fossil energy production to define resource-rich
    and resource-poor countries. The definitions of 'economy-high' and 'economy-low'
    are not given. The meaning of 'energy consumption transition' is not given.
  14: The importance of external shocks such as economic cycles and oil price fluctuations
    on the transition of energy consumption is highlighted.
