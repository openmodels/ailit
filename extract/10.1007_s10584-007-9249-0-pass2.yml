Drivers of Risk:
  10: Climate change
  13: Climate change impacts on crops; Biophysical uncertainties; Multiple stresses
    on crop management
  18: Climate change
  22: Doubled-CO2 (current climate) or doubled CO2 grid cell used
  23: Climate change (perturbations).
Highlights:
  10: Climate change can cause significant changes in crop yield, ranging from substantial
    decreases (-50%) to increases (50%).
  13: Adaptation requires a holistic approach beyond just biophysics, considering
    human management and multiple stresses on crops.
  23: Single-crop simulations indicate a mean yield loss of 30-40%. The study aims
    to capture most of the range of uncertainty using climate perturbations alone.
Methodology:
  10: Crop simulations are used to assess the response to climate change.
  13: Risk management approach to adaptation
  18: Model simulations and parameter perturbations constrained by observations, PFinter-comparisons
  22: Uses QUMP simulations and GLAM simulations; 12,720 baseline GLAM simulations;
    57,240 doubled CO2 GLAM simulations; Climate model parameters varied one at a
    time using expert opinion to determine the values; 20-year time series; 1 parameter
    perturbations.
  23: 'The fractional count represents the proportion of simulations at each yield
    loss level. Two approaches were tested: ''Full ensemble'' and ''Single-crop.''
    The ''Single climate, range of crop parameterisations'' approach uses observations.
    The method enables crop and climate perturbations.'
More Notes:
  13: The page highlights the importance of considering human factors in adaptation
    strategies, not solely focusing on the biophysical impacts of climate change on
    crops.
  18: The page emphasizes the importance of accounting for the anthroposphere and
    quantifying/reducing uncertainty in adaptation efforts.
  23: The study contrasts with a previous study (Pos) due to a constraint of crop
    parameters held constant.
No relevant information:
  9: This page primarily describes a crop model (GLAM) and its inputs/outputs, without
    directly linking it to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, nor adaptation
    costs and benefits at a national level. The mention of 'all-India groundnut yield'
    relates to agricultural productivity, but the page doesn't provide quantitative
    data or analysis connecting this yield to broader economic indicators or adaptation
    strategies.
  14: This page provides a high-level overview of climate change impacts on farming
    and adaptation strategies, but does not include specific macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes, quantitative data, or a defined methodology for analysis.
