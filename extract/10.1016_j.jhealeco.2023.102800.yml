Drivers of Risk:
  1: Rising global average temperatures leading to increased worker exposure to extreme
    heat impacting task performance, learning, and cognition.
  2: Higher maximum temperatures leading to increased occupational health claims.
  3: The study investigates the impact of maximum daily temperature within a postcode
    within a month-year on the number of occupational health claims.
  5: Outside ambient air temperature
  6: Maximum daily temperature
  8: Daily maximum temperature is the main driver of risk; specifically, high temperatures.
  10: Increases in maximum temperature.
  11: Maximum daily temperature.
  12: Maximum daily temperature.
  13: Maximum temperature increases due to climate change.
  14: High outside temperature, particularly affecting manual workers in outdoor-based
    industries; climate change.
Highlights:
  1: High temperatures lead to more worker health claims, especially for manual workers
    outdoors. Increasing vulnerability to heat over time (2015-2020). Female, older-aged,
    and higher-earning workers are most affected by heat. 'Safer' firms experience
    a larger percentage increase in claims on hot days.
  2: Higher maximum temperatures generate significantly more occupational health claims.
    Laborers and tradespersons are particularly vulnerable, especially in outdoor
    industries. Adaptation is difficult for workers in outdoor settings.
  3: The number of monthly claims has decreased over the analysis period, with a sharp
    decrease in December 1992 due to legislative changes restricting benefits.
  5: The study models the number of occupational health claims based on ambient air
    temperature, controlling for factors such as seasonal variations and precipitation.
  6: Higher temperatures are associated with increased occupational health claims,
    particularly for laborers and tradespersons. The effect has remained significant
    over time despite policy attempts to address the risk.
  8: "High temperatures increase occupational health claims, particularly for laborers\
    \ and tradespersons, but the effect may be mitigated by workplace adaptation measures\
    \ at extreme temperatures (>36\xB0C) in Victoria. There may also be a non-linear\
    \ relation between semi-elasticity and time period."
  10: Increases in temperature significantly increase claims for multiple accident
    natures, with the largest effect occurring for burns and heat-related accidents.
    Accidents caused by materials/substances and chemicals occur more in high temperatures.
  11: Maximum temperature increases claims, particularly for laborers and tradespersons
    in outdoor industries like agriculture and construction. The effect of temperature
    is heterogeneous across industries, occupations, demographics (sex, age, income),
    and firm size.
  12: "The percentage increase in claims related to temperature is largest at typically\
    \ 'safer' firms. Low claim firms experience a 0.69% total increase in claims for\
    \ each additional 1\xB0C in daily maximum temperature."
  13: "A warming of Victoria's climate by 1.5\xB0C is estimated to cost AU$40.3 million\
    \ annually in additional occupational health claims (compensated only) or AU$54.8\
    \ million (compensated and uncompensated)."
  14: "High outside temperature has a significant negative effect on workers\u2019\
    \ health, particularly for manual workers in outdoor-based industries; preventative\
    \ measures to make workplaces safer is difficult; adverse temperature effects\
    \ are observed throughout the 35-year analysis period, despite policy attempts\
    \ to address the risks."
Methodology:
  1: "Analysis of records spanning 1985\u20132020 from an Australian mandatory insurance\
    \ scheme. Firm-level panel analyses."
  2: Analysis of over two million occupational health claims in Victoria, Australia
    from 1985 to 2020, comparing differences in accident rates across days within
    the same postcode and month.
  3: "The study uses a semi-elasticity to compare the effects of temperature across\
    \ different periods (percentage change in claims for each 1\xB0C). They analyze\
    \ pre- and post-2000 data and control for changes in the workers' compensation\
    \ scheme."
  5: Area fixed-effects regression model is used to estimate the causal effect of
    outside ambient air temperature on the daily number of occupational health claims,
    using postcode (p) for each day (t) as the unit of analysis. A Poisson-distributed
    random variable is used. Preferred specification includes month-year-postcode
    fixed-effects. The impact of heat is identified through day-to-day variation in
    temperature within a given month-year of a specific postal-area. Regression covariates
    include day of week dummy variables and precipitation (mm).
  6: Regression analysis of occupational health claims data in Victoria, Australia,
    with standard errors clustered at the postcode level. Analysis considers time
    periods and occupational categories.
  8: "Poisson regression with month-year-postcode fixed-effects is used to estimate\
    \ the effects of daily maximum temperature on occupational health claims.  Robust\
    \ standard errors are clustered by postcode. Effects are shown for the period\
    \ 2000\u20132020 in one analysis."
  10: Poisson Regression with Month-Year-Postcode fixed effects. Standard errors are
    clustered by postcode. Analysis focuses on the period 2000-2020 in high-risk occupations
    (laborers and tradespersons).
  11: "Poisson regression with Month-Year-Postcode fixed effects. Robust standard\
    \ errors clustered at postcode level. Data from 2000\u20132020. Estimates displayed\
    \ as a semi-elasticity, as a percentage increase or decrease in the number of\
    \ claims."
  12: Poisson regression is used to estimate the effect of today's and yesterday's
    maximum temperature on the number of claims. The analysis also uses a two-stage
    approach to investigate the effect of heat between different types of firms (high-claims
    vs. low-claims), using fixed-effects linear regression to model the monthly number
    of claims. This analysis occurs for the period 2005-2019.
  13: Poisson regression on claims for laborers and tradespersons in Construction,
    Manufacturing, Agriculture, Forestry & Fishing between 2005 and 2019 in Victoria,
    Australia. Firms are classified as 'high claims' and 'low claims' based on median
    claims within their industry and size. Regressions include Month-Year-Postcode
    fixed effects.
  14: The change in the annual number of claims is calculated using estimates for
    temperature bins. The study uses a firm-level panel dataset covering 35 years.
More Notes:
  1: The magnitude of the heat-accident relationship may be context-specific. Data
    is from WorkSafe Victoria via the Compensation Research Database.
  2: The study measures the residual risk of heat after accounting for existing adaptation
    measures. Reduced concentration and psychomotor performance, as well as increased
    risk from environmental agents, are potential drivers of the effects.
  3: The study includes all claims, regardless of whether they were accepted by the
    insurer, but a robustness analysis tests the sensitivity of results to using only
    accepted claims.
  5: The study acknowledges limitations related to not observing the number of people
    working each day and uses a semi-elasticity to present results. The analysis focuses
    on Victoria, Australia, and restricts the sample to weekdays and omits postcode-months
    with zero claims every day of the month.
  6: The study focuses on serious accidents resulting in workers' compensation claims.
    It acknowledges potential selection bias, where workers with higher heat tolerance
    may disproportionately work in higher-risk settings, suggesting the estimates
    for laborers and tradespersons may be conservative.
  8: "The study focuses on Victoria, Australia, and its findings may not be directly\
    \ transferable to other national contexts without considering differences in economies,\
    \ climates, occupational health policies, and workers\u2019 compensation systems.\
    \ The semi-elasticity is shown over time in a series of five-year intervals, and\
    \ differs across the periods considered."
  10: The study suggests that the health impacts of heat extend beyond heat stress
    and likely affect concentration and psychomotor performance. Firms need to manage
    additional environmental hazards created by heat, such as increased volatility
    of chemicals. Workers in 'Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing' are more negatively
    affected by heat than workers from other industries.
  11: The study focuses on the impact of heat on worker claims, which is a microeconomic
    effect, but this *could* be extrapolated to an aggregate productivity loss or
    increased healthcare costs *if* this information was paired with industry size,
    and health system information to estimate population-level costs. The effect of
    temperature is non-linear.
  12: The study uses data from 172,615 unique firms. The analysis controls for Month-Year-Postcode
    fixed effects. Firm size is based on total annual remuneration in 2010/11 deflated
    to 2005/06 dollars.
  13: The study finds that the effect of temperature on claims differs between 'low
    claims' and 'high claims' firms. The majority of the economic burden falls on
    workers through lost earnings.
  14: "The adverse impacts of heat on workers\u2019 health may extend beyond human\
    \ physiological limits, including environmental factors like hot surfaces and\
    \ chemicals. The decrease in the overall heat effect is likely driven by changes\
    \ in the occupational composition away from high-risk occupations rather than\
    \ effective adaptation within occupations."
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Reductions in long-term earnings and productivity, and higher business costs
    (e.g. recruitment and training of substitute workers) due to workplace-related
    injuries and illnesses.
  2: Cost of heat-related accidents (estimated via back-of-the-envelope calculations).
  3: This paper focuses on occupational health claims submitted to Victoria's mandatory
    workers' compensation insurance scheme, which can be seen as a proxy for productivity
    loss due to workplace injuries and illnesses.
  5: Daily number of occupational health claims
  6: Occupational health claims (as a proxy for worker health and productivity)
  8: Occupational health claims are used as a proxy for worker health and potentially,
    productivity.
  10: Productivity loss in high-risk occupations (laborers and tradespersons) due
    to workplace accidents.
  11: Impact of temperature on number of claims (presumably related to worker injury
    or illness) across various industries and demographic groups.
  12: Increase or decrease in the number of worker compensation claims related to
    afflictions occurring between 2000 and 2020.
  13: Costs of heat-related occupational health claims (both compensated and non-compensated
    injuries and diseases).
  14: Increased heat-related workplace injuries and diseases, costs associated with
    worker's compensation claims.
Quantitative material:
  1: "High temperatures cause significantly more claims, particularly among manual\
    \ workers in outdoor-based industries; the largest effect observed for the 2015\u2013\
    2020 period; the percentage increase in claims on hot days is largest at 'safer'\
    \ firms."
  2: "A one-degree Celsius increase in the daily maximum increases claims by 0.24%,\
    \ or alternatively, a day reaching 33\u201336 \u25E6C averages 5.3% more claims\
    \ than a day 18\u201321 \u25E6C."
  3: The Compensation Research Database (CRD) recorded 2,156,960 claims corresponding
    to 1,159,249 unique claimants between 2nd September 1985 and 31st July 2020.
  5: "Melbourne experienced 34 days > 30\xB0C and 14 days > 35\xB0C in 2019. In Melbourne,\
    \ the average difference between the highest and lowest maximum temperatures in\
    \ a month is 19\xB0C in summer and 10\xB0C in winter. The sample contains 3,533,474\
    \ observations of the daily count of claims in a postcode."
  6: "A 1\xB0C increase in maximum temperature results in a 0.24% increase in occupational\
    \ health claims in Victoria, Australia. For laborers and tradespersons, a 1\xB0\
    C increase leads to a 0.35% increase in claims."
  8: "Laborers and tradespersons make 6.2% additional claims when the maximum temperature\
    \ is 33\u201336 \u25E6C, compared to 18\u201321 \u25E6C."
  10: "A 1\xB0C increase in maximum temperature causes a 1.57% increase in claims\
    \ for burns (p<0.01), a 0.19% increase in claims for diseases (p=0.02), and a\
    \ 2.11% increase in heat-related claims (p<0.01) for laborers and tradespersons\
    \ since 2000. Effects are measured as semi-elasticity percentages."
  11: "Table 5 provides semi-elasticity estimates for the impact of maximum temperature\
    \ on claims for different industries and occupations (e.g., a 0.76% increase in\
    \ claims for laborers and tradespersons in Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing for\
    \ each 1\xB0C increase in maximum temperature)."
  12: Table 6 shows semi-elasticities (%) representing the percentage increase or
    decrease in the number of claims for various worker characteristics (sex, age,
    earnings, firm size) and worker groups (all workers, laborers and tradespersons,
    laborers and tradespersons in agriculture or construction) in response to maximum
    daily temperature.
  13: "1.5\xB0C warming results in an additional 0.38% occupational health claims\
    \ for all workers, equating to 156 additional claims per annum at a cost of AU$40.3\
    \ million for Victoria (compensated claims only). Considering all injuries and\
    \ diseases, the annual cost is AU$54.8 million. Laborers and tradespersons account\
    \ for AU$37.4 million of this."
  14: "Past warming has an average per annum cost of AU$26.3 million for claims and\
    \ AU$35.6 million for all workplace injuries and diseases in Victoria; For laborers\
    \ and tradespersons, the annual costs are AU$15.6 million for claims and AU$21.2\
    \ million overall; A 1.5\xB0C increase in temperatures costing an additional AU$54.8\
    \ million each year in heat-related injuries and diseases at work."
