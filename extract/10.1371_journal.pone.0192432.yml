Drivers of Risk:
  2: The drivers of risk are identified as weather outcomes (temperature and precipitation)
    and their variations (intra-annual standard deviations) impacting agricultural
    production.
  3: Year-to-year temperature variation
  4: Year-to-year precipitation variability, temperature variability
  5: Changing configurations of temperature and precipitation, as well as secondary
    sources for water, such as irrigation.
  6: The paper considers the environment as a factor influencing agricultural productivity,
    implicitly acknowledging environmental changes as potential drivers.
  7: Fixed environmental variables (z), temperature, weather patterns.
  8: Weather variables include growing season temperature, cumulative precipitation,
    and intra-annual variations which include temperature and precipitation shocks
    and anomalies.
  9: Fixed characteristics of the environment (e.g., topography) and weather (precipitation
    and temperature).
  10: Temperature, Precipitation, Intra-annual Temperature variability, Intra-annual
    Precipitation variability
  11: Higher values of growing season temperature and variability of precipitation
    negatively impact agricultural output.
  12: The output-oriented environment index (OEI) contributes to a decline in TFP.
  14: Weather effects (across the Pacific region, the Southwest, parts of the Midwest,
    and the Northeast contributed negatively to TFP growth; while contributing positively
    in the Northern Plains and Mountain states).
  15: Weather variation is identified as a factor impacting TFP growth, with substantial
    heterogeneity across states and over time.
  17: Weather effects
  18: Weather, agro-ecological factors, changing configurations in weather
  19: The drivers of risk include global climate change, temperature changes, weather
    fluctuations, and water availability.

Highlights:
  2: Weather variability contributes to a decline in annual TFP growth in U.S. agriculture,
    with considerable heterogeneity over time and space. States in the northern part
    of the country experienced substantial year-to-year temperature variability between
    1960 and 2004.
  3: Northern and central states tend to have higher temperature coefficients of variation,
    while southern states have lower coefficients.
  4: "Considerable heterogeneity in the variability of temperature and precipitation\
    \ across the U.S. from 1960\u20132004. Northern Plains experienced intense year-to-year\
    \ precipitation variability compared to the rest of the country."
  5: The paper aims to address the gap in the literature regarding the role of changing
    weather patterns on TFP growth in the U.S. agricultural sector. It aims to isolate
    that impact.
  6: The TFP index used in this paper satisfies the transitivity axiom, unlike the
    widely used Fisher, Tornqvist, and Malmquist productivity indexes. The general
    TFP index can be decomposed into measures of environmental change, technological
    progress, and technical, scale, and mix efficiency changes.
  9: Coefficients for land, labor, capital and intermediate materials are nonnegative.
  10: Temperature has a negative effect on agricultural productivity (-0.4259), while
    precipitation has a positive effect (0.0261) based on coefficient estimates.
  11: Decreasing returns to scale are observed, and climatic variables like temperature
    and precipitation have significant impacts on agricultural productivity.
  12: Long-term growth in TFP has largely been driven by technological progress.
  14: Weather effects show considerable variation across states with negative impacts
    on TFP growth in Pacific, Southwest, Midwest and Northeast regions and positive
    impacts in Northern Plains and Mountain states.
  15: Technological progress was the key driver of TFP growth, averaging 1.21% per
    annum, while weather effects had a negative but negligible impact.
  16: "The table shows the average annual growth rates of TFP for the US and each\
    \ state. It also decomposes TFP growth into several components (%\u0394OTI, %\u0394\
    OTEI, %\u0394OSEI, %\u0394OEI, %\u0394SNI) from 1960 to 2004."
  17: Variability becomes an increasing burden, future policy interventions should
    focus on promoting mitigation and adaptation activities, and public support should
    be directed to research and development as well as in adaptive measures.
  18: Technological change has a positive effect on agricultural output and is the
    primary driver behind TFP growth; output-oriented technical efficiency has a substantial
    impact on TFP growth; management practices that promote increased farm efficiency
    should be directed towards tailored educational and training programs focusing
    on best management practices that allow for the large spatial variation in weather
    and agro-ecological factors.
  19: The highlights seem to focus on assessing the economic effects of climate change
    on U.S. agriculture and understanding adaptation strategies. Several papers also
    address the impact of global warming on crop yields.
Methodology:
  2: The study uses a stochastic production frontier model incorporating input-output
    data, weather variables, and time-invariant characteristics of the production
    environment (e.g., topography) using data from 1960-2004. The model is used to
    decompose a TFP index.
  3: The coefficient of variation for temperature is estimated using the Kelvin scale.
  4: Analysis of precipitation variability across the U.S. from 1960-2004 and examination
    of its impact on agricultural production patterns.
  5: The study uses a stochastic production frontier approach to examine the direct
    impact of changing configurations in weather on agricultural output. It distinguishes
    between the production technology and environmental factors, such as weather and
    topography.
  6: The paper uses an axiomatic approach to total factor productivity (TFP) decomposition
    based on the general index proposed by O'Donnell [20]. The analysis is applicable
    when certain properties related to the production possibilities set are satisfied,
    and the paper outlines several axioms that the TFP index should satisfy, including
    monotonicity, linear homogeneity, identity, commensurability, proportionality,
    and transitivity.
  7: Uses stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to estimate parameters in a Cobb-Douglas
    log-distance function. Data from 1960-2004 for 48 U.S. states.
  8: Utilizes a Cobb-Douglas stochastic production frontier model, incorporating variables
    such as land, labor, capital, intermediate inputs, and weather variables.
  9: Uses a stochastic production frontier model (Greene [44,45]) to decompose TFP
    change. They use a panel unit root test of Maddala and Wu [51] and a Pedroni [52]
    test to address endogeneity concerns. They failed to reject the null hypothesis
    of a unit root for the dependent and explanatory variables, but concluded that
    the variables are cointegrated.
  10: Stochastic production frontier model
  11: The analysis uses state-level fixed effects and allows the rate of technological
    change to vary quinquenially.
  12: TFP growth is decomposed into contributions from technology, technical efficiency,
    scale efficiency, and environment. Data is analyzed for 48 contiguous states from
    1960-2004.

  15: Weather variables are integrated into a stochastic production frontier model
    to analyze TFP growth, incorporating the general TFP index proposed by O'Donnell
    (2010).

  18: Estimating stochastic production frontier model and decomposing U.S. total factor
    productivity; micro-level productivity approach; combines localized climatic information
    with micro-level input-output data
  19: The methodologies used include Ricardian analysis, econometric analysis, productivity
    index decomposition, and production frontier analysis. The applicability of the
    results varies depending on the specific study and the region/crops analyzed (primarily
    U.S. agriculture).
