  54: Not explicitly stated, but implied to be related to country-specific economic
    and fiscal factors influencing sovereign debt and economic performance; Implicitly
    linked to factors considered by Fitch, Moody's, and S&P in their ratings.
  56: This page focuses on data availability regarding sovereign spreads, rather than
    specific climate-related drivers of risk. The risk here is the lack of data hindering
    analysis.
Highlights:
  1: The paper explores the implications of 'asymmetric sovereign risk' for 'climate
    change preparation.'
  5: Investing in climate change preparedness effectively mitigates vulnerability
    to climate change for countries with low spreads and long-term debt; however,
    for countries with high spreads and short-term debt, additional measures are necessary.
  6: Climate change vulnerability is significant for shorter maturities, especially
    for high-risk countries with elevated borrowing costs.
  7: Determinants of spreads have varying relevance across different segments of the
    spread distribution. The dynamics of spreads diverge when they are high compared
    to when they are low, especially between emerging/low-income and developed economies.
  8: External factors significantly impact country-specific risk, long-term interest
    rates reflect expectations about a government's future solvency and financing
    needs, while short-term rates indicate concerns about liquidity and short-term
    performance, low economic growth and greater economic openness amplify default
    risk, heightened indebtedness increases short-term risk.
  9: Climate change and natural disasters can impact sovereign risk, and there is
    no evidence of a 'greenium' in sovereign debt markets for environmentally friendly
    initiatives.
  10: Climate change vulnerability has a greater impact on the sovereign spreads of
    high-risk countries (upper quantile of spread distribution) for short-term maturities,
    but impacts the sovereign spreads of low-risk countries more for longer maturities.
  11: Climate change has a highly asymmetric impact on emerging and low-income developing
    countries compared to developed countries; spreads predominantly react to vulnerability
    and readiness to climate change as a general concept, rather than the actual occurrence
    of natural disasters; economic losses from natural disasters increase spreads,
    while the number of people exposed to disasters reduces spreads.
  17: The model incorporates climate change vulnerability and readiness indicators
    (ND-GAIN) to assess the impact of climate change on sovereign risk.
  19: Panel quantile models are essential for estimating the direct effects of economic
    and climate-related determinants on spreads. Ignoring unobserved heterogeneity
    would lead to biased estimates. A single time-varying factor can capture a significant
    portion of the variation in credit spreads globally.
  23: Countries that have endured natural disasters could be more susceptible to climate
    risk vulnerabilities.
  24: "The ND-GAIN index is composed of vulnerability and readiness dimensions. Vulnerability\
    \ pertains to a country\u2019s predisposition to being adversely affected by climate-related\
    \ hazards. Readiness signifies the nation\u2019s level of preparedness to undertake\
    \ adaptive measures."
  25: The ND-GAIN index and its components are correlated with a country's level of
    development (positive correlation with readiness, negative correlation with vulnerability).
  28: Higher debt-to-GDP ratio, inflation, and increased vulnerability to climate
    change contribute to higher sovereign yield spreads. Improved institutions contribute
    to lower spreads.
  29: Heightened preparedness for climate change adaptation contributes to lower sovereign
    risk spreads; Vulnerability to climate change and inflation have substantial positive
    effects on sovereign risk.
  30: The impact of inflation on sovereign risk is asymmetric, being more pronounced
    at higher quantiles of sovereign risk (higher spreads). The effect of inflation
    is also more pronounced at longer maturities. The effect of the debt-to-GDP ratio
    is generally non-significant at short maturities.
  31: Climate change influences sovereign risk through physical and transition risks;
    vulnerability to climate change is positively related to sovereign risk, similar
    in magnitude to inflation's effect.
  32: Climate change vulnerability increases sovereign borrowing costs. Climate change
    readiness can offset the positive effects of vulnerability on borrowing costs.
  36: Terms of trade negatively impact sovereign yields. Natural resource rents have
    a slight, often insignificant, positive impact on sovereign yields. Institutional
    factors are key contributors to cross-country credit risk variations.
  37: Institutional quality (Rule of Law) is negatively correlated with government
    borrowing costs, especially for long maturities and at lower quantiles. Quantile
    regressions are robust to outliers. Spread differentiation into three risk groups
    for 1-year spreads at the 0.9 quantile.
  38: Sovereign spreads are lower in the absence of disaster risk, suggesting natural
    disasters constrain governments' access to financial markets.
  40: Incorporating natural disasters improves the model, particularly for 5-year
    maturities (although data from 5 year maturities is not provided on this page).
    Rule of Law becomes more significant when natural disasters are incorporated.
  41: The table shows the impact of various factors on sovereign yield spreads across
    different maturities and quantiles. Natural disasters are generally insignificant
    across quantiles and maturities.
  42: Natural disasters in category 3 are frequently significant and positive as a
    GDP loss. Specific natural disasters (e.g., Natural D. 3.2) show statistically
    significant effects on the components, especially at the lower quantile (0.1)
    with positive values. Some natural disasters at specific quantiles (e.g. Natural
    D. 3.3, quantile 0.9 and 2 year spread), have large negative effects.
  43: Disaster occurrences elevate spreads in certain instances, particularly the
    third category, while people exposed and death-related disasters often have negative
    effects on spreads.
  44: Sovereign spreads respond differently to economic determinants depending on
    whether spreads are very high or very low; Climate change poses an asymmetric
    risk to emerging and low-income developing countries; Spreads predominantly react
    to vulnerability and readiness to climate change as a general concept rather than
    the actual occurrence of natural disasters; Determinants exert distinct impacts
    on government borrowing costs, contingent on the spread level.
  45: Natural disasters have small or insignificant effect on sovereign risk once
    controlling for traditional determinants; Climate change affects sovereign risk
    through macroeconomic and institutional channels; Readiness reduces sovereign
    risk at long-term maturities; Vulnerability has a greater impact than readiness
    in countries with high spreads and short-term debt.
  46: Natural disasters have a positive relation with economic losses to GDP and can
    shift spread distribution upward, increasing sovereign risk.
  49: Climate change impacts sovereign creditworthiness (Klusak et al., 2023); economic
    complexity potentially reduces the probability of fiscal crisis (--------, 203b).
  54: Provides summary statistics for a range of macroeconomic and fiscal indicators,
    including GDP per capita, sovereign debt ratings, bond yield spreads, and fiscal
    rule quality.
  56: Data on sovereign spreads, particularly for 1, 2, 5, and 10-year maturities,
    has missing observations over the period 2000-2019. Years with high missing data
    are excluded from analysis.
Methodology:
  1: The paper is an IDB Working Paper, suggesting an economic analysis, potentially
    involving modeling or econometric techniques. The mention of 'asymmetric sovereign
    risk' hints at a focus on how the risks and opportunities may be unevenly distributed.
  4: Working Paper (IDB Working Paper Series; 1588)
  5: The analysis uses panel-quantile regressions to assess the asymmetric reactions
    of sovereign risk to its determinants.
  6: Empirical framework to evaluate the effects of variables across the entire conditional
    spread distribution, analysis of debt dynamics, which are inherently nonlinear.
  7: Empirical modeling of sovereign risk and yields, panel quantile models to examine
    the nonlinear relationship between explanatory factors and sovereign spreads.
  8: Econometric modeling of sovereign spreads, analysis of different maturities of
    sovereign yields and spreads, analysis of common international factors, assessment
    of the impact of external factors on country-specific risk.
  9: Literature review, exploration of financial costs, interviews, surveys of finance
    ministers and key stakeholders, data analysis from national statistics on emissions,
    energy sources, and fiscal revenue from fossil fuel sales, projection of potential
    scenarios of GDP and fiscal losses.
  10: "The analysis explores the impact of climate change preparation and mitigation\
    \ strategies, alongside countries\u2019 vulnerability, on the determination of\
    \ borrowing costs using regression analysis (implicitly). Sample size is N=68\
    \ countries. Results are conditional on various spread levels."
  11: Models incorporate occurrence of natural disasters into the determination of
    sovereign spreads, examines asymmetric responses across the spread distribution.
  12: The study employs a novel factor-augmented panel quantile regression framework
    and uses a Random Forest machine learning algorithm for imputation.
  13: Maximum likelihood estimation using mixture distributions with fixed unobserved
    effects; Factor analysis using principal component analysis (PCA) to extract a
    time-varying market factor from yield spreads; addresses issue of missing yield
    data using imputation
  14: Variables include fiscal rules, crisis indicators, and real GDP growth rate.
  15: The paper uses Random Forest (RF) to handle missing data in a dataset of macroeconomic
    and institutional variables to predict sovereign yield spreads. This approach
    is chosen over linear factor models because RF can capture complex and nonlinear
    relationships in the data, which is crucial for analyzing sovereign yield spreads.
  17: 'Quantile regression is used to model the relationship between explanatory variables
    and the quantiles of yield spreads. Two approaches are mentioned: distribution-free
    (fixed effects) and likelihood-based (random effects). The analysis appears to
    use panel data models of yield spreads.'
  18: Linear quantile mixed model. Non-Parametric Maximum Likelihood (NPML) approach
    is used to estimate the mixing distribution.
  19: Panel quantile models are used to estimate the effects of economic and climate-related
    determinants on spreads. PCA is used to estimate a time-varying common factor.
    The analysis uses a longitudinal setting to model unobserved heterogeneity between
    countries. An Asymmetric Laplace Distribution (ALD) is used for the estimation.
    The inclusion of the factor structure is driven by the need to tailor the methodology
    from a statistical medicine context to an international macroeconomic setting.
  20: Panel-quantile models, Random Forest (RF) imputation
  21: This page is a summary of main variable statistics used in a study; further
    information on the analysis is likely available within the paper.
  23: The analysis incorporates macroeconomic, fiscal, and institutional covariates
    to address potential confounding factors. Binary variables are used to indicate
    when a country experiences a natural disaster. The study excludes the years 2020
    and 2021.
  24: Uses the ND-GAIN Country Index, which consolidates a country's susceptibility
    to climate change consequences and its readiness to bolster resilience.
  25: Uses the ND-GAIN index, which comprises readiness and vulnerability components.
    A Random Forest (RF) method is mentioned for imputing missing data related to
    'spreads'.
  28: Quantile regressions are used to estimate the impact of determinants on sovereign
    yield spreads. All variables were scaled to have zero mean and unitary variance
    before estimation.

    using PCA; Analysis considers short-term and long-term maturities
  30: Quantile regressions examining the impact of inflation and debt-to-GDP ratio
    on sovereign bond spreads at different maturities (1-year, 2-year, 10-year).
  31: Uses NGFS framework; empirical approach focuses on exposure to climate change
    risk rather than spread level.
  32: Quantile regression analysis is used to estimate the impact of vulnerability
    and readiness on sovereign yield spreads. Variables have been scaled to have zero
    mean and unit variance to facilitate comparison of effects. The analysis considers
    different quantiles of the yield spread distribution.
  36: Panel data analysis (Panel A and Panel B), quantile regression, statistical
    significance testing.
  37: Panel quantile regression; Analysis differentiated by quantiles and maturities
    (1-year, 2-year, long maturities).
  38: Analysis introduces natural disasters as a determinant of sovereign risk, using
    EMDAT indicators with a comprehensive sample of countries.
  40: A new model is used that explicitly considers the occurrence of natural disasters
    to determine cross-country heterogeneity in sovereign debt markets. The model
    uses quantile regression (0.9, 0.5, and 0.1) and examines the impact of various
    factors (Readiness, Vulnerability, etc.) on sovereign bond spreads.
  41: Modeling country-idiosyncratic effects on sovereign yield spreads, including
    traditional country-specific effects and variations in the location of spread
    distributions resulting from natural disasters. Variables are standardized to
    have zero mean and unit variance.
  42: 'Quantile regression is used to analyze the impact of natural disasters on macroeconomic
    components. The analysis considers different quantiles (0.1, 0.5, 0.9) which represent
    different parts of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable. The
    analysis is performed for different time horizons: 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years
    spreads.'
  43: The analysis uses a mixture model of three distributions with country specific
    natural disaster variables, highlighting significant coefficients.
  44: Examines the impact of natural disasters on sovereign debt while accounting
    for macroeconomic, institutional, and fiscal variables; integrates the occurrence
    of natural disasters into the determination of sovereign spreads

    results depends on the underlying data and the specific research question.
  53: Descriptive statistics on a panel of countries and years, using data from IMF,
    World Bank, Drazanova, and Bloomberg. No explicit causal model is described on
    this page.
  54: Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max) are calculated
    for various economic and fiscal indicators across countries; Debt spike is calculated
    based on a percentile threshold; Sovereign spreads are calculated by the authors
    based on Bloomberg data; Fiscal rule quality is from IMF/Schaechter et al.
  56: The analysis excludes years and maturities with a larger amount of missing data.
More Notes:
  1: The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) is the source, suggesting a focus on
    Latin American and Caribbean countries.
  4: The paper focuses on asymmetric sovereign risk and its implications for climate
    change preparation in Latin America and the Caribbean. The paper is licensed under
    Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY 3.0 IGO).
  6: The study recognizes different dynamics expected from emerging, low-income, and
    advanced economies; the impacts of vulnerability, preparedness, and other determinants
    are not uniform across the spread distribution; the adverse effects of climate
    change will disproportionately affect countries with initially higher spreads
    and reliance on mainly short-term debt.
  7: The study aims to expand the existing body of research on the impact of climate
    change and natural disasters on sovereign risk. It distinguishes emerging and
    low-income economies from developed economies when analyzing sovereign risk.
  9: The page emphasizes the importance of understanding fiscal policies and global
    initiatives addressing climate change, but also points out that recommendations
    can be overly broad and may not fully recognize specific national contexts.
  10: The analysis extends previous research by incorporating factors like international
    commonality, economic complexity, and natural disasters.
  11: The paper complements Klusak et al. (2023), who focused on the effect of climate
    change on sovereign risk through the macroeconomic channel.
  13: The paper focuses on modelling and imputing sovereign yield spreads, which could
    be indirectly related to macroeconomic risks and fiscal outcomes if those risks
    influence sovereign borrowing costs. The references cited (e.g., Chudik and Pesaran,
    Bai and Ng, Stock and Watson) might provide further insights into the relationship
    between macroeconomic factors and yield spreads.
  14: The study focuses on addressing the problem of missing data in sovereign risk
    analysis, particularly the underrepresentation of developing countries.
  15: The paper mentions variables such as inflation, consumption share, VIX, debt-related
    variables (revenues, fiscal balances, interest paid by debt, credit ratings),
    institutional variables (rule of law, regulatory quality, voice and accountability),
    and political factors (fractionalization, polarization indices) are considered.
    It also uses data from Du et al. (2016, 2018) and references Gomez-Gonzalez, Uribe,
    and Valencia (2023a).
  17: The use of quantile regression allows for analyzing the impact of risk factors
    on different levels of sovereign risk (different quantiles of the yield spread
    distribution). The model also considers individual country effects and the impact
    of natural disasters.
  18: The model incorporates country- and quantile-specific random coefficients to
    account for unobserved heterogeneity. It uses an Asymmetric Laplace Density (ALD)
    to facilitate maximum likelihood estimation.
  19: The analysis aims to isolate the effects of various factors on sovereign credit
    spreads, accounting for global macroeconomic forces and country-specific heterogeneity.
    The model includes a factor structure to capture common dynamics affecting sovereign
    credit spreads globally.
  20: 'The study uses two datasets: a main dataset for regression and a second dataset
    with 66 variables (macroeconomic, debt-related, and institutional/political) for
    training the RF imputation.'
  21: The sovereign spreads, ND-GAIN readiness and vulnerability indicators, economic
    complexity indicator, rule of law, and terms of trade are included and appear
    relevant for a broader macro-fiscal risk assessment related to climate change.
    The EMDAT disaster data is included.
  23: The country sample is larger than previous studies, including data starting
    from 2000.
  24: The data on weather disasters comes from the EM-DAT database. Data related to
    rents from natural resources, growth, inflation, terms of trade, and debt-to-GDP
    ratio comes from the IMF's World Economic Outlook (2019). Rule of Law estimate
    from World Bank. Economic Complexity Indicator (ECI) from Harvard Growth Lab.
  25: The paper uses 'spreads' (likely bond yield spreads) as a key variable and imputes
    missing values using a Random Forest algorithm. The table in the appendix seems
    to contain information for spreads imputation and the variables that were used
    for it.
  28: The analysis aligns with a broad consensus in the literature and maintains a
    direct connection to economic intuition and theoretical foundations, with all
    variables demonstrating the expected signs in accordance with theoretical expectations.
  29: The model aims to explain the variation in sovereign debt spreads based on various
    economic and climate-related factors.
  30: The paper suggests that inflation can improve debt-to-GDP ratios, mitigating
    its impact on sovereign yields.
  31: Value of sovereign bonds is contingent upon how countries manage their natural
    capital; pressure to align sovereign bonds with environmental sustainability is
    expected to intensify.
  32: The study diverges from Beirne, Renzhi, and Volz (2021) by highlighting the
    importance of climate change readiness, while the latter emphasizes vulnerability.
  37: The paper suggests that natural disasters play a role in determining yield spreads.
  40: The debt-to-GDP ratio's significance is inconsistent, losing significance in
    some specifications but gaining it in others. The 'Common factor' variable is
    consistently significant and negative across all spreads and quantiles.
  41: Variables achieving significance in the updated model specification are highlighted
    in green, while variables that lose significance are highlighted in red, compared
    to models that did not incorporate variables for natural disasters.
  42: The components 1, 2, and 3 have significant influence to these natural disaster
    impacts. The numbering of natural disasters (e.g. 1.1, 1.2) is not explained but
    likely refers to disaster category and sub-category, or region. The specific nature
    of components 1, 2, and 3 is not defined in this extract, but their inclusion
    as part of idiosyncratic components implies they are part of the model to explain
    spread values. The p-values indicate the statistical significance of the estimated
    coefficients.
  43: Effects on spreads are generally small and below 4% in most cases, except for
    a notable positive impact in specific cases related to the second category of
    disasters.
  44: The paper distinguishes its approach from Klusak et al. (2023) by directly examining
    the immediate consequences of natural disasters on sovereign debt dynamics.
  45: Humanitarian aid following natural disasters with substantial human losses can
    mitigate credit risk; Developed countries actively preparing for climate change
    experience lower debt spreads and primarily finance through long-term debt; Emerging
    and low-income economies are in a distressing situation.
  49: Several papers address sovereign risk and fiscal stability, which are relevant
    to assessing the macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks of climate change. The papers
    using quantile regression techniques could be particularly useful for analyzing
    the distributional effects of climate change.
  51: This page contains references to papers addressing volatility related to natural
    resources, climate change and sovereign risk, factor models, and statistical methods
    for handling missing data, which could be relevant for analyzing macroeconomic
    and macro-fiscal risks of climate change.
  52: The extremely large maximum values for 'Gross capital formation, % GDP' (442.77),
    'Gross fixed capital formation, % GDP' (319.06) and 'Change nominal exchange rate,
    end period' (1314185) are implausible and suggest data errors or outliers that
    should be examined.
  53: This page appears to be presenting descriptive statistics for a set of macroeconomic,
    fiscal, and political variables that are likely to be used in a broader analysis.
    The fractionalization and polarization indices, as well as the voice/accountability,
    political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality and control
    of corruption are governance measures, that could indicate political-economic
    risks.
  56: ISO3 country codes are associated with the spread data, suggesting country-level
    analysis.

Quantitative material:
  6: Climate change vulnerability becomes notably significant for shorter maturities,
    especially those equal to or less than two years.
  8: No specific quantitative estimates are provided on this page, but it mentions
    empirical assessment of external factors on country-specific risk.
  9: Findings reveal the absence of a greenium in sovereign debt markets.
  10: An increase of one standard deviation in the ND-GAIN climate vulnerability index
    is associated with a 27% (14%) rise in the 90th quantile of the 2-year (1-year)
    spread. The same increment leads to a 7% increase in the 10th quantile for both
    the 2-year and 1-year spreads.
  11: Effects of natural disasters are relatively modest compared to vulnerability
    and readiness to climate change indicators.
  17: Equation (3) and (4) present the model for quantile regression with specific
    variables and coefficients.
  19: First principal component in the factor model of credit spreads accounts for
    42.8% of the variability.
  20: Spreads contain imputed observations, and there is significant variability in
    the spreads.
  21: 'Provides summary statistics (Mean, Median, Std.Dev, Max, Min) for various macroeconomic
    and disaster-related indicators, including GDP growth (Mean: 3.65), inflation
    (Mean: 4.32), debt (% of GDP) (Mean: 56.02), and natural resource rents (% of
    GDP) (Mean: 2.66). Also contains data on the frequency of disasters exceeding
    certain thresholds (e.g., >100,000 people affected).'
  23: The study involves a sample of 68 countries, with roughly 44% being advanced
    and 56% being emerging or low-income developing nations. Sovereign spreads can
    be negative, but spreads are notably higher in the short term.
  24: ND-GAIN index, vulnerability indicators (exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity)
    for health, food, ecosystems, habitat, water, and infrastructure; readiness indicators
    (economic, social, and governance).
  25: ND-GAIN readiness index ranges from 0.20 (Nigeria 2014) to 0.81 (Singapore 2014).
    ND-GAIN vulnerability index ranges from 0.25 (Switzerland 2015) to 0.60 (Uganda
    2004).
  28: The figure summarizes the effects of all determinants across spreads quantiles
    and maturities, with variables scaled to have zero mean and unitary variance.
    Increased vulnerability to climate change contributes to higher spreads across
    all maturities.
  29: Common factor impact ranges between -3 and -6 percent
  30: Inflation's impact on 1-year spreads falls from 0.27 to 0.17-0.18 when transitioning
    from the 90th quantile to the 50th and 10th quantiles. For the 2-year spread,
    this decreases from 0.21 to 0.12 to 0.08. For 10-year maturity, the effects diminish
    from 0.20 to 0.13 to 0.09 as we transition from the 90th quantile to the 50th
    and 10th quantiles. Debt-to-GDP ratio has a modest effect, ranging between 8 and
    11 percent for the median and 90th quantile of the 2-year spread and between 6
    and 8 percent for the lower quantiles of the 10-year spread.
  31: Positive relationship between vulnerability and sovereign risk, comparable in
    magnitude to the effect of inflation (as measured by the scaled quantile slopes
    of the indicators). Association is particularly pronounced at the highest quantiles
    of spreads.
  32: Table 3 shows estimated coefficients, standard errors, z-values, and p-values
    for determinants of yield spreads at 1-year and 2-year maturities for different
    quantiles (0.1, 0.5, 0.9). For example, vulnerability has a statistically significant
    positive effect on 2-year yield spreads at all quantiles (0.27, 0.13, 0.07), while
    readiness has a statistically significant negative effect (-0.12, -0.10, -0.07).
  36: Terms of trade have a modest and negative impact (-4% to -10%) on sovereign
    yield spreads. Natural resource rents result in a marginal increase in spreads
    but are not statistically significant in most instances.
  37: 'The spread differentiation for 1-year spreads at the 0.9 quantile reveals three
    groups: spreads with a mean of zero, spreads around 0.36 standard deviations,
    and a high-risk group around 1.17 standard deviations.'
  38: Table displays the idiosyncratic components results with estimates, standard
    errors, and z-values for spread over 1, 2, 5, and 10 years, with significance
    levels.
  40: Table 5 presents estimates, standard errors, z-values, and p-values for various
    drivers of risk on sovereign bond spreads (1-year and 2-year maturities at quantiles
    0.9, 0.5, and 0.1).
  41: Impact of determinants on sovereign yield spreads at quantiles 0.1, 0.5, and
    0.9 for spread of 5 and 10 years. Table presents coefficients and p-values.
  42: Table 6 provides estimates, standard errors, z-values, and p-values for the
    impact of different categories of natural disasters on some macroeconomic components
    at different quantiles (0.9, 0.5, 0.1) and time horizons (1 year, 2 years, 5 years).
    Specifically, the table shows the idiosyncratic components results including natural
    disasters.
  43: The table displays quantitative data on the spread and effects of disasters
    in different quantiles and clusters.
  44: Mentions quantiles of spread distribution (0.9 and 0.1)
  45: Effects of natural disasters are modest compared to vulnerability and readiness
    indicators; Readiness most effective at reducing sovereign risk at long-term maturities
    (5 and 10 years); Increments in readiness can be smaller than the effects of vulnerability,
    especially in high-spread countries

    a range of macroeconomic and fiscal indicators. For example, Gross capital formation
    (% GDP) has a mean of 23.73, a median of 21.96, a standard deviation of 16.02,
    a maximum of 442.77, and a minimum of -39.73.
  53: Provides summary statistics (Mean, Median, Std.Dev, Max, Min) for a range of
    macroeconomic and fiscal indicators, including government balance, GDP, revenue,
    debt composition, resource rents, and interest rates.

    each indicator.
  56: The figure shows the frequency of missing observations for sovereign spreads
    with maturities of 1, 2, 5, and 10 years for the years 2000-2019. The y-axis is
    implicitly country count, with a sample size of 68 countries.
