Drivers of Risk:
  1: Positive effects from increased CO2 concentrations may enhance photosynthesis;
    Negative effects from high local temperatures potentially exacerbated by global
    warming.
  5: Global temperature anomalies, global CO2 concentration, drought, fertilizer use
    (phosphorus (P2O5), potassium (K2O), nitrogen (N))
  10: Global temperature anomalies, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, technological
    innovations in crop practices (no-till adoption, new seeds), commodity prices
    (soybean), input prices (fertilizer)
  12: Climate change, high temperatures during the plant growing season, changes in
    atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
  13: Climate change, global warming
Highlights:
  5: Global temperatures are shown to have long-run negative effects on crops, such
    as the development of plagues and pests, which are difficult to measure. Carbon
    fertilization may have positive effects on plant growth, but only if nutrient
    levels, soil moisture, and water availability are met.
  10: Climate variables (temperature, CO2), technological factors (no-till, new seeds)
    and economic factors (prices) are all important for understanding crop yield behaviour
    in the long run.
  12: Soybean yields in the long run are mainly dominated by technology innovation
    variables. Short-run determinants include positive effects from changes in atmospheric
    CO2 concentrations and negative climate effects from high temperatures.
Methodology:
  1: Multivariate time-series analysis with dynamic specification and encompassing
    tests to study soybean yields in Argentina considering climatic, technological,
    and economic factors.
  5: Econometric analysis; considering global temperature anomalies relative to the
    1951-1980 base period.
  6: A cointegration approach is used to study the effects of crop-yield drivers,
    working with partial systems to deal with dimensionality, collinearities, and
    endogeneity issues. This approach is applied to climate, technological, and economic
    systems to model soybean yields. A multivariate cointegration approach is used
    to model the long-run behavior of soybean yields.
  10: Cointegration analysis, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation, instrumental
    variable (IV) estimation, Autometrics model selection
  12: Econometric approach to evaluate the effect of climate change on crop yields,
    considering climatic, technological, and economic factors. Uses a partial system
    approach and an automatic algorithm (Autometrics) to analyze the long-run behavior
    of soybean yields.
  13: Econometric analysis of long-run technological drivers of soybean yields, considering
    adaptation to climate factors. Uses OxMetrics 8 for automatic selection and system
    estimations. Addresses trend removal and collinearity. Considers cointegration
    rank using CATS in OxDoornik and Juselius. Employs a general to specific strategy
    for variable selection.
More Notes:
  5: The study focuses on Argentina and soybean yields, potentially limiting its direct
    applicability to broader macroeconomic and fiscal analysis at a national level
    without further generalization or similar analysis performed on other nations
    or economic sectors.
  6: The focus of this research seems to be on modeling soybean yields using climate,
    technological and economic factors. While not directly a macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    analysis, it considers elements that are important for a national economy.
  10: Deforestation, driven by agricultural expansion incentivized by increasing yields,
    can affect atmospheric CO2 concentrations and global warming, potentially offsetting
    anthropogenic emissions. The paper emphasizes the importance of evaluating the
    exogeneity of variables within the economic-climatic system due to the feedback
    loops between human activity and climate change.
  12: "The paper focuses on the effects of climate change on crop yields in Argentina,\
    \ the world\u2019s third-largest producer and exporter of soybeans."
  13: Suggests further research on whether technological drivers of soybean yields
    are a result of economic factors or adaptation to climate change.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  5: Soybean yields
  10: Soybean yields (proxy for agricultural productivity)
  12: Crop yields, specifically soybean yields.
  13: Soybean yields
Quantitative material:
  10: "A 0.06\xB0C increase in temperature is estimated to decrease soybean yields\
    \ by almost 10% in the long run. A 0.47% increase in CO2 concentrations is estimated\
    \ to increase soybean yields by about 4% during 1971\u20132015."
  12: "Ten additional days of maximum temperature above 30\u25E6C during the growing\
    \ season produce a decrease of around 10% in soybean yields."
