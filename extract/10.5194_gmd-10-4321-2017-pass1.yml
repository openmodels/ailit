Drivers of Risk:
  19: "The impact of 1.5\xB0C and 2\xB0C warming as well as the 1\xB0C warming that\
    \ has occurred since pre-industrial times are being assessed."
Highlights:
  19: ISIMIP2b scenario design facilitates understanding of climate impacts across
    different warming scenarios including the assessment from pre-industrial times
    to present.
Methodology:
  19: Simulations based on ISIMIP2b protocol enable assessment of climate change impacts
    and integration of cross-sectoral impacts.
No relevant information:
  5: This page focuses on describing the ISIMIP2b climate model simulation design
    and does not directly provide quantitative macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risk
    assessments, costs, or benefits of adaptation at a national level. It outlines
    scenarios and modeling approaches for assessing climate change impacts on various
    sectors, but does not present concrete results relevant to the specified economic
    outcomes.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  19: ISIMIP2b protocol simulations are anticipated to provide cutting-edge projections
    of climate change impacts.
