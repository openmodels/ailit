Drivers of Risk:
  1: Droughts, specifically the 2010 drought and precipitation anomalies.
  2: Increased climatic variability including longer and drier dry seasons in some
    regions, increased temperature, and extreme dry events; The 2010 drought in Amazonia.
  8: Drought (specifically 2005 and 2010 events)
  11: "2010 drought in Amazonia, particularly the southern half, with the greatest\
    \ \u03B4W anomaly."
  12: Drought
  17: Drought, exacerbated by elevated temperatures.
Highlights:
  1: Amazon forests did not gain biomass during the 2010 drought interval, reversing
    a long-term biomass sink. This was driven by increased mortality and decreased
    productivity.
  2: The 2010 drought had a systematic basin-wide impact on tree growth rates across
    Amazonia, leading to a reduction in biomass carbon uptake.
  8: Net biomass change was significantly lower in 2010 compared to the long-term
    mean, indicating a negative impact of the 2010 drought. The mean net biomass change
    anomaly was strongly and significantly negative during the 2010 census interval.
  11: The Amazon basin, typically a carbon sink, became carbon neutral during the
    2010 drought, representing a reversal of its long-term carbon sink function.
  12: The 2010 drought led to a widespread reduction in forest productivity (growth)
    in the Amazon.
  17: Drought negatively impacts neotropical forest carbon storage, causing a large-scale
    reduction in tropical forest productivity; forests were not inoculated against
    a second major drought in 5 years.
Methodology:
  1: Ground-based observations of mortality and growth from an extensive forest plot
    network.
  2: Analysis based on ground data, live biomass in trees, corresponding estimates
    of live biomass in lianas and roots, and comparison to long-term mean; Comparison
    of the 2010 drought to the 2005 drought based on tree growth rates.
  8: The analysis uses plot-level biomass change data and calculates mean net biomass
    change. Bootstrapped confidence intervals are provided and t-tests are performed.
    The analysis compares biomass change during drought periods to baseline periods
    (1998 to pre-2010).
  11: Field measurements scaled by region from intact nonanthropogenically degraded
    plots and unmeasured aboveground and below-ground components for forest census
    spanning the 2010 event.
  12: Analysis of tree growth and mortality across the Amazon using forest censuses
    which cover the 2010 drought period.
More Notes:
  1: The study suggests pre-2010 droughts did not compound the effects of the 2010
    drought.
  2: The magnitude of tree mortality was unrelated to estimated local precipitation
    anomalies and was independent of estimated local pre-2010 drought history. The
    2010 drought impact differed from the 2005 drought event which did not affect
    productivity.
  8: The units of measurement are Mg ha/yr. The study focuses on the Amazon forest
    response to droughts.
  11: Approximately 30% of the reduction in C uptake in 2010 was caused by a reduction
    in productivity, while the remainder is due to increased tree mortality and subsequent
    dead wood decomposition.
  12: Mortality was elevated in 2010, but not related to estimated precipitation anomalies.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Biomass changes in Amazon forests.
  2: Reduction in biomass carbon uptake due to the 2010 drought is estimated at 1.1
    Pg C, compared to 1.6 Pg C for the 2005 event; Intact forests in Amazonia were
    carbon neutral in 2010.
  8: Net biomass change (Mg ha/yr)
  11: "Reduction in carbon uptake (\u0394Cnetchange) in 2010 is estimated at 0.47\
    \ Pg C yr\u207B\xB9 (or 1.1 Pg C during the average 2.3 year 2010 census interval)\
    \ for the Amazon basin."
  12: Net biomass change of forests
  17: Large-scale reduction in tropical forest productivity.
Quantitative material:
  1: 'During the 2010 drought interval, forests did not gain biomass (net change:
    -0.43 Mg ha-1, CI: -1.11, 0.19, n=97). Pre-2010 biomass sink was 1.33 Mg ha-1
    yr-1 (CI: 0.90, 1.74, p<0.01). The resulting net impact of the 2010 drought was
    -1.95 Mg ha-1 yr-1 (CI: -2.77, -1.18; p<0.001). Biomass mortality increased (1.45
    Mg ha-1 yr-1 CI: 0.66, 2.25, p<0.001) and biomass productivity declined (-0.50
    Mg ha-1 yr-1, CI: -0.78, -0.31; p<0.001).'
  2: 1.1 Pg C reduction in biomass carbon uptake in 2010; 1.6 Pg C reduction in 2005;
    Carbon neutral in 2010 (/C0 0.07 Pg C yr/C0 1 CI:/C0 0.42, 0.23).
  8: 'Table 2 provides quantitative data on net biomass change during, before, and
    spanning the 2010 and 2005 drought events, including mean values and confidence
    intervals. For the 2010 event, the net biomass change was 0.43 Mg ha/yr (95% CI:
    -1.11, 0.19). Baseline net biomass change (1998 to pre-2010) was 1.33 Mg ha/yr
    (95% CI: 0.90, 1.74).'
  11: "Intact forests during the 2010 drought lost biomass in three of five regions;\
    \ Scaling measurements indicate the Amazon basin was carbon neutral during 2010\
    \ (0.07 confidence interval (CI): -0.42, 0.23 Pg C yr\u207B\xB9). Reduction in\
    \ C uptake in 2010: 0.47 Pg C yr\u207B\xB9; Reduction in productivity: 0.14 Pg\
    \ C yr\u207B\xB9 (CI: -0.27, -0.03)."
  12: Plots did not gain biomass in 2010, regardless of drought classification.
  17: Estimates of basin-wide vegetation being carbon neutral in 2010 closely match
    independently derived estimates from a regional-scale inversion using airborne
    measurements of greenhouse gases.
