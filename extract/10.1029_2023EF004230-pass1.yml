Drivers of Risk:
  1: Decreases in vertical wind shear and increases in relative humidity in near-coastal
    regions.
  2: TC rapid intensification, specifically increases in magnitude and frequency,
    and its proximity to coastal regions.
  3: Projected changes in vertical wind shear (VWS) in nearshore regions; Anomalous
    basic state, diabatic heating, and transient forcing impacts on VWS; Tropical
    cyclone (TC) intensification rates
  4: Nearshore tropical cyclone intensification rates from 1979-2020, VWS (vertical
    wind shear), and thermodynamic potential intensity
  5: Nearshore TC intensification rates have increased, particularly in the later
    period (2000-2020) compared to the earlier period (1979-1999). Environmental factors
    like SST, VWS, and RH have also changed, potentially influencing TC intensification.
  6: Changes in Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Vertical Wind Shear (VWS), and Relative
    Humidity (RH) are identified as drivers impacting storm development.
  7: The study suggests that changes in SST, vertical wind shear, and relative humidity
    drive changes in TC intensification.
  8: Nearshore tropical cyclones (TCs) intensification rates; SSP585 emissions scenario
  9: Increasing anthropogenic forcing leads to a more favorable nearshore environment
    for TC intensification.
  10: Changes in vertical wind shear (VWS) are driven by factors such as diabatic
    heating, zonal-mean basic state changes, and transient forcing.
  11: Anomalous heating forced by anthropogenic warming is linked to the shear response
    along the US coast and Mexican west coast.
  12: Identifies decreased vertical wind shear (VWS) near coastal areas as a significant
    driver of enhanced TC intensification.

  12: Discusses potential strengthening of landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) due
    to enhanced nearshore intensification.
Highlights:
  1: Nearshore TC intensification rates have increased from 1979-2020 and are projected
    to continue to rise under global warming, primarily due to decreasing wind shear.
  2: The study examines observed changes in nearshore TC intensification and the large-scale
    environment historically, projects future changes using climate model simulations,
    and explores the responsible mechanisms.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Probability distributions of nearshore TC intensification rates reveal a noticeable
    change between the 1979-1999 and 2000-2020 periods.
  5: Nearshore TC intensification has increased significantly in the later period
    (2000-2020) compared to the earlier period (1979-1999), while offshore intensification
    has not increased significantly over the same period. Changes in nearshore TC
    intensification rates are generally larger than offshore changes, except for the
    Mexican west coast and South Asian coast where changes are not statistically significant.
  6: The large-scale environment has become more favorable for storm development in
    nearshore regions compared to offshore regions. Stronger weakening of global nearshore
    VWS is primarily driven by substantial decreases of VWS near the East Asian and
    Australian coasts. Nearshore RH trend is dominated by increases near the US and
    Australian coasts.
  7: "There has been a significant rise in the average intensification rate of nearshore\
    \ TCs on a global scale during 1979\u20132020."
  8: TCs will continue to strengthen faster in the nearshore region in the future
    climate; increases in mean intensification rate in all coastal areas except near
    the west coast of Mexico and the Australian coast; change in the nearshore region
    is greater than in the offshore region
  9: Stronger decreases in VWS and larger increases in RH near coasts are key factors
    for increased nearshore TC intensification.
  10: SWM can reproduce the overall spatial pattern of VWS changes, indicating decreasing
    VWS over coastal areas, particularly influenced by diabatic heating and basic
    state changes.
  11: "Climate change-induced anomalous heating contributes to a decrease in VWS near\
    \ Taiwan and the southeastern coast of China, but tends to strengthen VWS over\
    \ northeast Asia and the northern Indian Ocean. An altered zonal mean basic state\
    \ decreases VWS over Northeast Asia and the North Indian Ocean, while slightly\
    \ increasing shear near 40\xB0N over North America. Enhanced static stability\
    \ plays a crucial role in reducing the VWS across Northeast Asia and the North\
    \ Indian Ocean."
  12: Enhanced tropical upper-level warming and inter-basin changes in diabatic heating
    contribute to weakened VWS along US coastlines.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of observations, atmospheric reanalyses, and high-resolution climate
    model simulations. Idealized numerical experiments with an intermediate complexity
    model.
  2: The study uses TC track data (IBTrACS, ADT-HURSAT), SST data (UK Met Office Hadley
    Center), and atmospheric data (NCEP-DOE II reanalysis, ERA5 reanalysis) to analyze
    historical TC intensification. It also uses data from five HighResMIP climate
    models for 2015-2050 and 15 CMIP6 models for 2015-2100 under the SSP585 scenario
    to project future changes.  TC tracks are derived using TempestExtremes software.
  3: "Uses CMIP6 and HighResMIP models; Applies a time\u2010dependent, primitive equation\
    \ anomaly model (Stationary Wave Model, SWM) to conduct numerical sensitivity\
    \ experiments; SWM has R30 horizontal resolution (roughly 2.25\xB0 latitude \xD7\
    \ 3.75\xB0 longitude) and 24 vertical sigma layers; SWM simulations are run for\
    \ 100 days, and the average from days 31 to 100 is presented; Five independent\
    \ integrations using the SWM are performed: CTRL (2015-2034), Future (2081-2100),\
    \ CTRL+\u0394BS, CTRL+\u0394DH, and CTRL+\u0394TranF; Monte Carlo method of repeated\
    \ random sampling is used to estimate uncertainty in probability distributions\
    \ of TC intensification rates"
  4: "Analyzes observed changes in global 24-hr TC intensification rates in the nearshore\
    \ region over the period 1979\u20132020. A Student\u2019s t-test for difference\
    \ of means is used to ascertain statistical significance. Error bars have been\
    \ estimated using the Monte Carlo method of repeated random sampling. The data\
    \ have been sub-sampled to ensure that distributions of storm state are statistically\
    \ similar for the two periods. VWS is estimated as the magnitude of the vector\
    \ difference in horizontal winds between 200 and 850 hPa. All parameters are averaged\
    \ over the months of Jun\u2013October in the Northern Hemisphere and December-April\
    \ in the Southern Hemisphere."
  5: TC track data from IBTrACS are used. A Student's t-test for difference of means
    is used to determine statistical significance (95% level). Data is subsampled
    to ensure statistically similar distributions of storm initial intensity and translation
    speed between the two periods. Trends in observed SST are based on data from the
    UK Met Office's Hadley Center. Trends in VWS and 600-hPa RH are derived from the
    NCEP-DOE atmospheric reanalysis II.
  6: Analysis uses UK Met Office's Hadley Center SST data and NCEP-DOE II reanalysis
    data for atmospheric winds and humidity, averaged over June-October (Northern
    Hemisphere) and December-April (Southern Hemisphere). ERA5 reanalysis data was
    also used to test data source sensitivity.
  7: HighResMIP simulations are used for qualitative assessment of climate change
    impacts on TC intensification.
  8: Uses TC track data from five fully coupled climate models belonging to HighResMIP;
    Historical period 1979-2014, future 2015-2050; SSP585 emissions scenario; TC track
    data is subsampled to ensure statistically similar distributions of TC initial
    intensity and translation speed.
  9: The analysis uses multi-model ensembles from HighResMIP for the period 1979-2050
    under the SSP585 emissions scenario.
  10: "Analysis is based on CMIP6 models and a Stationary Wave Model (SWM) under the\
    \ SSP585 emissions scenario, comparing near-future (2015\u20132034) and late 21st\
    \ century (2081\u20132100) periods."
  11: The analysis examines the impact of anomalous heating, spatial distribution
    of SST warming, and altered zonal mean basic state on vertical wind shear (VWS)
    using climate models and observational data.
  12: Analysis based on IBTrACS, ADT-HURSAT TC track data, Hadley SST data, NCEP-DOE
    II reanalysis, ERA5 reanalysis, HighResMIP TC track data, and CMIP6 models.
More Notes:
  1: The study highlights the importance of understanding nearshore TC intensification
    due to its socio-economic threat.
  2: The study aims to address the gap in comprehensive examination of TC intensity
    changes in the critical nearshore region at a global scale, and to consider future
    projections of TCs in addition to historical observations.
  3: The Stationary Wave Model cannot explicitly simulate synoptic eddies; instead,
    their aggregated effects are considered as a fixed forcing term.
  4: "The study focuses on nearshore regions, defined as within 3\xB0 of the coastline.\
    \ Mentions analysis using IBTrACS data (Knapp et al., 2010), but this is a reference\
    \ and not part of the analysis performed on this page."
  5: The paper examines the evolution of large-scale environmental parameters that
    play critical roles in storm intensification, including SST, VWS, and RH.
  6: Stippling on the maps indicates that trends are statistically significant at
    the 5% level.
  7: HighResMIP models simulate weaker changes in TC intensity compared to best track
    data.
  8: The mean intensification rate is weaker in HighResMIP relative to observations,
    likely because of limitations simulating intensest storms.
  9: The study emphasizes the coastal nature of TC intensification without a basin-wide
    shift.
  11: The meridional dipole-like response of VWS over the Central and North American
    region is mainly excited by enhanced heating over the tropical eastern Pacific,
    with a secondary contribution from anomalous diabatic cooling over the tropical
    North Atlantic.
  12: Notes the importance of understanding uncertainty in projected heating trends
    due to inter-model spread in SST warming patterns.
Quantitative material:

    \ period (1979\u20131999) and later period (2000\u20132020), and the difference\

    \ of means of the distributions."
  5: "Global mean TC intensification rate for 1979\u20131999 is 0.37 kt 6-hr-1, while\

    \ over a 24-hr interval). Table 1 provides observed changes in mean nearshore\
    \ and offshore TC intensification rates (kt 6-hr-1) for various coastlines during\
    \ 1979-2020."

    Nearshore RH trend: 0.057% year-1; Time period: 1979-2020'
  7: Relative humidity is increasing at 0.057 %/year (coastal) and 0.011 %/year (offshore)
    from 1979-2020.
  8: Mean TC intensification rate increases from -0.07 kt 6-hr-1 (1979-2014) to 0.03
    kt 6-hr-1 (2015-2050).
