Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increases in relative humidity and decreases in vertical wind shear are responsible
    for changes in tropical cyclone intensification rates near coasts.
  4: "Observed changes in global 24-hr TC intensification rates in the near-shore\
    \ region over the period 1979\u20132020."
  6: The large-scale environment has become more favorable for storm development in
    the nearshore region compared to the offshore region.
  8: Increased Tropical Cyclone (TC) intensification rates nearshore due to climate
    change (SSP585 emissions scenario).
  10: Changes in diabatic heating and basic state atmospheric conditions are dominant
    in shaping the spatial pattern of vertical wind shear response in the Northern
    Hemisphere; Anomalous transient forcing has a small contribution to vertical wind
    shear changes.
  12: Heightened nearshore intensification rate of landfalling tropical cyclones under
    global warming; anticipated growth of coastal population and wealth; decrease
    in vertical wind shear (VWS) near coastal areas.

Highlights:
  1: The study finds a global mean tropical cyclone intensification rate increase
    of about 3 kt per 24-hour in nearshore regions over the 1979-2020 period.
  4: Nearshore TC intensification rates show a noticeable difference between the periods
    1979-1999 and 2000-2020, with a statistically significant increase in the later
    period.
  6: Global nearshore VWS is weakening, primarily driven by substantial decreases
    near the East Asian and Australian coasts. Nearshore RH trend is positive and
    significant, dominated by increases near the US and Australian coasts.
  8: TC intensification rates nearshore are expected to increase in the future climate,
    except near the west coast of Mexico and the Australian coast. The change in nearshore
    TC intensification is greater than in the offshore region in basins where there
    is an increase.
  10: Diabatic heating and changes in the basic state are key drivers of wind shear
    patterns in the Northern Hemisphere. The SWM is able to reproduce the overall
    spatial pattern of VWS changes, particularly over coastal areas characterized
    by decreasing VWS.
  12: Global warming may lead to a potential strengthening of landfalling TCs' destructive
    capacity.

Methodology:
  1: Utilizes observations and high-resolution climate model simulations to analyze
    trends in nearshore tropical cyclone intensification from 1979 to 2020 and projections
    under global warming.
  4: "Analysis of observed changes in global 24-hr TC intensification rates in the\
    \ near-shore region over the period 1979\u20132020 using TC track data based on\
    \ IBTrACS. A Student's t-test for difference of means is used to ascertain statistical\
    \ significance."
  6: Analysis of trends in Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Vertical Wind Shear (VWS),
    and Relative Humidity (RH) over the period 1979-2020 using data from UK Met Office's
    Hadley Center and NCEP-DOE II reanalysis (and confirmed with ERA5 reanalysis data).
    Trends are averaged over June-October in the Northern Hemisphere and December-April
    in the Southern Hemisphere. Statistical significance is assessed at the 5% level.
  8: Analyzes TC track data from five fully coupled climate models belonging to HighResMIP.
    Compares historical (1979-2014) and future (2015-2050) periods using the SSP585
    emissions scenario. Data is sub-sampled to ensure statistical similarity of storm
    state and independence of track locations. Monte Carlo method used for estimating
    error bars. Sensitivity analysis performed with varying distance thresholds.
  10: Analyzes changes in vertical wind shear (VWS) using CMIP6 models and a Stationary
    Wave Model (SWM) under the SSP585 emissions scenario for near-future (2015-2034)
    and late 21st century (2081-2100) periods. The SWM is used to decompose the effects
    of individual forcings.
  12: Analysis based on IBTraCSTC track data, ADT-HURSAT TC track data, HadleySST
    data, NCEP-DOE II reanalysis, ERA5 reanalysis, HighResMIP TC track data, and CMIP6
    data.

More Notes:
  4: "The study focuses on nearshore regions within 3\xB0 of the coastline in specific\
    \ domains: (30\xB0S\u201310\xB0S,30\xB0E\u201380\xB0E) and Australian coast (30\xB0\
    S\u201310\xB0S,80\xB0E\u2013160\xB0W). Parameters are averaged over the months\
    \ of Jun\u2013October (Northern Hemisphere) and December\u2013April (Southern\
    \ Hemisphere)."
  6: The study finds that the findings are not sensitive to specific data sources
    by substituting ERA5 reanalysis data.
  8: The study acknowledges that the mean intensification rate in HighResMIP is weaker
    than in observations, likely due to limitations in simulating intense storms.
    The analysis focuses on nearshore regions.
  10: The study acknowledges discrepancies between CMIP6 and SWM simulations, attributing
    them to the lack of full coupling in the SWM and potential inaccuracies in dissipation
    parameterization or missing physical processes.
