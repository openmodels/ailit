Drivers of Risk:
  1: Storm surges, intensified by climate change, sea level rise, and increased storm
    intensity pose risks to coastal populations and economies.
  3: Storm surge events triggered by tropical cyclones.
  4: Storm surges
  5: Storm surges from tropical cyclones, coastal topography (slope), maximum relative
    water level rise.
  6: Storm surges, Tropical cyclones, Maximum relative water level rise
  7: Storm surges associated with extreme precipitation and strong winds.
  8: Storm surge intensity, affected areas, terrain and landforms in disaster areas,
    other natural factors, disaster prevention facilities, and implementation of disaster
    prevention and reduction measures.
Highlights:
  3: Assesses potential storm surge impacts on population and GDP at a global scale.
  4: The study focuses on storm surge impacts, using tide gauge records and spatial
    analysis to assess potential inundation areas, which implicitly affects economic
    activity, though those effects are not quantified on this page.
  5: High risk areas for population exposure to storm surges are located in the Caribbean
    region, the Bay of Bengal, and East Asia.
  6: High economic losses are mainly distributed in some coastal areas of England,
    other developed countries in Europe, the Yangtze River Delta in China, the eastern
    coast of the United States, and the Gulf of Mexico.
  7: This study examined the potential global impact of storm surges on populations
    and economies.
  8: Identifies countries most at risk from storm surge impacts in terms of inundated
    area, affected population, and affected GDP. Illustrates the distribution of GDP
    along coastlines via a world map to visualize potential economic exposure.
Methodology:
  1: Potential inundated areas are projected using information diffusion theory and
    historical sea-level observation records, considering coastal morphology and tropical
    cyclone tracks.
  3: Uses fuzzy information processing and a Markov chain process to assess storm
    surge impact. Combines hazard, environment, and exposure data in a GIS environment
    to estimate the area inundated by storm surge and the potential affected population
    and GDP.
  4: The paper uses tide gauge records to calculate the annual maximum relative water
    level (storm surge intensity). It then uses inverse distance weighted interpolation
    to extrapolate the expected annual maximum of relative water level rise. Area-altitude
    analysis is used to calculate the potential maximum inundated area. The method
    relies on diffusion function and fuzzy subset theory for probability distribution
    analysis.
  5: The expected annual maximum of relative water level rise is interpolated using
    the inverse distance weighted interpolation method. Potential maximum inundated
    area is calculated from slope data. Affected population and GDP are calculated
    by superimposing global population density and GDP distribution data on the inundated
    area map.
  6: Uses historical storm surge disaster records from the Global Risk Data Platform
    (GRDP) from 1975 to 2007 to produce a country ranking of risk based on inundated
    areas, affected population, and GDP loss.
  7: Uses available and recent global datasets from various sources to examine the
    potential global impact of storm surges on populations and economies; does not
    use a global storm surge simulation model.
  8: Simulated potential annual maximum inundated area based on yearly expected value
    of maximum relative water level rise at each tide gauge, then calculated the population
    and GDP potentially affected annually by storm surges. The comparison with historical
    storm surge losses indicates that the results in this study are reliable.
More Notes:
  4: The page focuses on modeling storm surge intensity and potential inundation area
    but does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes.
  5: The study divides global coastlines into plain-storm, plain-nostorm, bedrock-storm,
    bedrock-nostorm coastal areas. It further divides storm coasts into 10 zones based
    on cyclone origin and paths.
  6: The study validates its results by comparing country rankings derived from the
    GRDP data with country rankings from their own study. Bay of Bengal has high population
    exposure risk, but not high economic risk due to underdeveloped economies.
  7: The sample size for potential population and GDP impacts is 57 countries and
    the top 10% countries are listed in Table 2 (not provided).
  8: The study acknowledges limitations due to the absence of a global database on
    shoreline protection, which prevents incorporating the effect of existing manmade
    protection measures and natural coastal protective features.

  4: No relevant information
  5: Maximum relative water level rise of 300 cm or more is estimated for 17 stations
    (5.4% of all stations).
  6: Maximum relative water level rise (cm), Number of stations with different maximum
    relative water level rise, Country ranking of risk of 57 countries according to
    the sum of inundated areas, affected population, and GDP loss
  7: Significant correlation is found at the 0.01 confidence level (bilateral) between
    inundated area and population impact, with a correlation coefficient of 0.72.
    Country rankings of population and GDP impacts are moderately correlated at the
    0.01 confidence level (bilateral), with correlation coefficients of 0.47 and 0.57.

    population, and potential affected GDP by storm surges. Figure 7 presents the
    expected economic risk of storm surge impact of the world.
