Drivers of Risk:
  1: Precursor emissions, atmospheric transport, leaf uptake, plant biochemical defense
    capacity, changing climatic conditions, increasing atmospheric CO2, altered emission
    patterns.
  2: Ozone pollution is a key driver of risk, with changing climatic conditions potentially
    altering characteristics of receptors and atmospheric reactions/transport. Future
    agroecosystems may differ in their sensitivity to ozone due to new crops/varieties.
  3: Ozone concentration in the air near the leaf surface (exposure), leaf conductance
    to gas diffusion, atmospheric transport and turbulent diffusion. Also elevated
    CO2, temperature, and interactions between ozone, CO2, and temperature.
  4: Ozone exposure is identified as the primary driver impacting crop and pasture
    outcomes.
  5: Ozone levels, influenced by photochemical production from natural and anthropogenic
    precursors, and its variation due to different factors like radiation, temperature,
    and air mixing.
  6: Anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors; Trends in temperature, humidity
    and solar radiation
  8: Drivers of risk are climate change, base-line ozone levels due to altered large-scale
    emission patterns, and pollutant emissions.
  9: Accumulated stomatal uptake of ozone (AFst6) is a key driver of risk.
  10: "Increased ozone concentration, increased temperature (+3\xB0C), increased CO2\
    \ concentration"
  12: Increased ozone levels, climate change (specifically elevated CO2 and temperature),
    and management interventions (cutting or grazing) impacting canopy structure and
    microclimate.
  13: Interactive effects of increased temperature, drought, and elevated CO2 impact
    leaf morphology and crop yield during sensitive periods.
  14: The paper identifies climate change, elevated CO2, and ozone levels as drivers
    of risk impacting plant phenology, pest/disease interactions, and soil carbon
    processes.
  15: Elevated ozone concentrations, temperature increases, drought, heat, and salt
    stress.
  17: Ozone exposure and its effects on plant growth and physiology are discussed.

  21: Growth under elevated CO2 ameliorates defenses against photo-oxidative stress
    in poplar (Populus alba x tremula).
Highlights:
  1: Ozone is the most important regional-scale air pollutant causing risks for vegetation
    and human health.
  2: Ozone affects photosynthesis, biomass, leaf area index, grain number, and grain
    mass. Ozone impairs photosynthetic CO2 fixation, accelerates leaf senescence,
    inhibits reproduction by affecting pollen germination, fertilisation and abscission
    or abortion of flowers, pods and individual ovules or seeds. Ozone impairs phloem
    loading and assimilate partitioning.
  3: Ozone effects on crop quality are not straightforward; ozone increases grain
    protein concentration while decreasing protein yield in wheat; ozone reduces sugar
    and starch content in potato tubers while increasing ascorbic acid concentrations.
  4: The research highlights significant ozone impacts on crop yield, notably in soybean,
    and its complexity on pasture response.
  5: Annual mean surface concentrations of ozone at mid to high latitudes have more
    than doubled since the last century.
  6: Future ozone trends depend on anthropogenic emission path of precursors and on
    trends in temperature, humidity, and solar radiation; Projected ozone changes
    vary depending on emission scenarios and region, with stronger increases expected
    in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East
  7: Increasing temperatures and biogenic emissions favor ozone production, potentially
    leading to longer ozone episodes and increased ozone accumulated exposure over
    the growing season.
  8: Climate change, combined with altered emissions, could increase the frequency
    of years with higher cumulative ozone exposures in Europe, despite emission control
    measures. Pessimistic emission scenarios (A2) suggest substantially higher ozone
    levels by 2030/2050, particularly on the Indian subcontinent, in Southeast Asia,
    and in some African regions.
  9: Ozone flux to leaves is partitioned to stomata and to external surfaces, influenced
    by surface destruction of ozone depending on leaf surface characteristics and
    surface conditions.
  10: "Lower ozone risk for winter wheat under +3\xB0C conditions due to CO2-dependent\
    \ reduction in gmax and decreased gs from increased leaf-to-air vapour pressure\
    \ deficit."
  12: Species occupying the lower part of the canopy had reduced ozone uptake compared
    with taller companion species, despite similar stomatal conductance; elevated
    CO2 may cause a modest increase in LAI.
  13: Shifts in crop phenology and plant structure adapt to climate stressors, with
    mixed effectiveness of elevated CO2 on plant defence mechanisms against ozone
    and other stresses.
  14: Key outcomes include potential shifts in the phenological calendar of crops,
    secondary impacts of ozone exposure on pests and diseases, and changes in soil
    carbon processes due to ozone.
  15: Ozone effects on plants are influenced by exposure, leaf uptake, and plant defense
    capacity, all of which are affected by changing emissions and climate conditions.
    Negative impacts of ozone on stable soil C pools could be aggravated by higher
    Ta.

    enrichment systems (SoyFACE) to evaluate crop and pasture responses to ozone.
  6: Analysis based on IPCC SRES emission scenarios, multi-model simulations for 2030,
    and projections for 2030 using different models
  7: The page discusses modeling studies and analysis of past extreme warm years (e.g.,
    2003) as analogues for future conditions to project trends in ozone.
  8: The study uses atmospheric transport and chemistry models (MATCH) to project
    AOT40, and regional models to project ozone episodes. It also discusses the effective
    flux (EFst) and cumulative effective loading (AFst) of ozone. Applicability depends
    on emission scenarios and model uncertainties.
  9: "The relationship between relative yield and accumulated stomatal uptake of ozone\
    \ (AFst6) is modelled. The integration period for AFst6 was from 270\xB0C days\
    \ before anthesis until 700\xB0C days after anthesis for wheat and from plant\
    \ emergence until 1,130\xB0C days after emergence for potato. A Jarvis-type model\
    \ is used."

More Notes:
  1: Crop sensitivity may decline in areas where warming is accompanied by drying,
    and increase in higher latitudes where rapid warming occurs without declining
    air and soil moisture.
  2: The review addresses ozone risks for crops and pastures today and how such risks
    could be influenced by the changing climate.
  3: The paper mentions a simplified risk assessment approach for ozone, with a diagram
    illustrating the process from precursor emission to leaf damage via stomatal uptake
    and biochemical reactions. The effectiveness of CO2 in protecting from ozone effects
    may decrease with increasing temperature. The paper discusses how ozone can diminish
    the stimulating effect on yield of elevated CO2, and conversely, increased temperature
    can cancel out fertilization benefits.
  6: No relevant information
  7: The impact of increased CO2 on hydrocarbon emissions may be limited due to reduced
    emission rates per unit leaf area. The quantitative contribution of various processes
    to ozone production on larger scales remains uncertain.
  9: Surface wetness generally enhances total ozone flux to foliage. Climate change
    can affect surface wetness, influencing ozone impacts. Stomatal conductance (gs)
    is influenced by various environmental factors including solar radiation, temperature,
    vapor pressure deficit, CO2 concentration, and soil water potential.

    \ specifically, it increased from 15\u201325 ppb to 40\u201350 ppb in remote areas."
  6: "Average ozone in surface air over much of the northern hemisphere could increase\
    \ by 2 to 7 ppb across the range of IPCC SRES emission scenarios by 2030; More\
    \ extreme scenarios project baseline ozone increases of >20 ppb by 2100, while\
    \ other scenarios yielded changes of -4 to +10 ppb; With current air quality legislation\
    \ implemented worldwide global surface ozone would increase by 1.5 \xB1 1.2 ppb\
    \ on average by 2030, but by 4.3 \xB1 2.2 ppb for the IPCC SRES A2 scenario; Projections\
    \ for 2030 resulted in an ensemble mean change in tropospheric ozone burden ranging\
    \ from a 5% decrease to an increase by 6% and 15%, depending on the emission scenario"

    4 and 6 by 2050 and 2100 respectively, for an emission scenario without pollution
    control.
