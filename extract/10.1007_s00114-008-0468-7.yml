Drivers of Risk:
  1: Ozone pollution; Increasing emissions; Climate change (increasing temperatures,
    altered rainfall, more frequent extreme weather events); increasing atmospheric
    CO2; altered emission patterns

Highlights:
  1: Ozone is the most important regional-scale air pollutant causing risks for vegetation
    and human health in many parts of the world; Crop sensitivity may decline in areas
    where warming is accompanied by drying, such as southern and central Europe, in
    contrast to areas at higher latitudes where rapid warming is projected to occur
    in the absence of declining air and soil moisture; In regions with rapid industrialisation
    and population growth and with little regulatory action, ozone risks are projected
    to increase most dramatically, thus causing negative impacts major staple crops.

Methodology:
  1: "Review of recent findings about ozone effects under current conditions and trends\
    \ in regional ozone levels and in climatic factors affecting the plant\u2019s\
    \ sensitivity to ozone to assess implications of these developments for future\
    \ regional ozone risks."

More Notes:
  1: Model improvements are necessary to better define specific targets for crop improvements,
    to identify regions most at risk from ozone in a future climate and to set robust
    effect-based ozone standards.
