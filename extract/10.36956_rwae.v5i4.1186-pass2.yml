  13: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global warming (measured by CO2 emissions) is identified as a driver of food
    insecurity. Also inflation, foreign direct investment (FDI), GDP per capita, population
    growth, food imports, and arable land.
  6: Global warming
  8: Food Imports (%), FDI (US$), CO2 Emissions (Metric Tons per Capita), Arable Land
    (Hectares), GDP per Capita (US$), Population Growth Rate (Millions)
  10: CO2 emissions (as a proxy for global warming), income inequality, FDI inflows
  12: Changes in Population Growth, Infant Mortality, GDP per capita, Food Import,
    Foreign Direct Investment, CO2 Emissions per capita, and Agricultural Land
  13: Climate change (CO2 emissions, global warming); Rainfall variability; Temperature
    extremes; Global commodity price shifts; Climate-induced food shortages
Highlights:
  1: The research finds a positive long-term correlation between food insecurity and
    climate change in West Africa.
  6: The study aims to establish the effect of global warming on food security in
    West African countries.
  7: All variables show positive skewness, suggesting right-skewed distributions with
    longer tails on the right side.
  8: CO2 emissions, population growth, arable land, and food imports have statistically
    significant relationships with the prevalence of malnutrition. Specifically, a
    1% increase in CO2 emissions leads to an 18.3% increase in malnutrition. Higher
    import levels aggravate food insecurity.
  10: Increased CO2 emissions correlate with higher per capita GDP and higher incidence
    of malnutrition in West Africa. Increased FDI inflows should lead to decreased
    food insecurity in theory, but its impact on West Africa is complex. Income inequality
    exacerbates food insecurity in West Africa.
  12: 'Several unidirectional causal relationships were found, including: Population
    Growth causing Prevalence of Malnutrition, Prevalence of Malnutrition causing
    Infant Mortality, GDP per capita causing Population Growth, Population Growth
    causing GDP per capita, CO2 Emissions per capita causing Population Growth, Population
    Growth causing CO2 Emissions per capita, Agricultural Land causing Population
    Growth, Population Growth causing Agricultural Land, Infant Mortality causing
    GDP per capita, GDP per capita causing Infant Mortality, Agricultural Land causing
    Infant Mortality, Food Import causing Foreign Direct Investment, Agricultural
    Land causing CO2 Emissions per capita, and CO2 Emissions per capita causing Agricultural
    Land.'
  13: A causal link exists between food insecurity and global warming in West Africa;
    Climate-smart agriculture program is recommended to tackle malnutrition induced
    by climate change.
Methodology:
  1: The study employs Kao co-integration, FMOLS (Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares),
    and GLM (Generalized Linear Model) techniques to analyze secondary panel data.
  6: Panel data analysis using Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Generalized
    Linear Model (GLM) econometric techniques, covering 11 West African countries
    from 2000 to 2020.
  7: Descriptive statistics were used to assess data dispersion and identify potential
    outliers. Skewness and kurtosis analysis were conducted to understand data distribution
    characteristics. Jarque-Bera test was used to assess the normality of distributions.
  8: Panel unit root tests, Kao co-integration test, and panel FMOLS (Fully Modified
    Ordinary Least Squares) estimation are used to analyze the relationship between
    malnutrition and other macroeconomic variables. The analysis is conducted on West
    African countries.
  10: Panel unit root tests and Kao co-integration test, GLM estimates (mentioned
    but not detailed on this page); results apply to West Africa
  12: 'Panel Granger causality tests were performed to examine the causal relationships
    between the variables. Wald test and Heteroscedasticity Test: PesaranCD are also
    implemented.'

    GLM, and panel Granger causality techniques; Histogram normality test (Jarque-Bera
    test).
More Notes:
  1: The study is focused on West Africa and the agricultural sector's vulnerability
    to climate change.
  6: Control variables include food prices, per capita GDP, population growth rate,
    food import and arable land.
  7: The analysis focuses on West African countries.
  8: The study uses logarithmic transformations of variables, allowing coefficients
    to be interpreted as elasticities. The analysis finds evidence of a long-run equilibrium
    between the prevalence of malnutrition and the selected predictor variables.
  10: The paper finds a significant long-term linkage between CO2 emissions and food
    insecurity in West Africa.
  12: The data used appears to be panel data. The Wald test indicates that each variable
    in the model is significant. The Heteroskedasticity Pesaran CD test indicates
    no cross-sectional dependence among the residuals, indicating the observations
    in the panel are independent of each other. Residuals are found to be normally
    distributed.
  13: Study limitations include data unavailability in certain West African countries,
    potential constraints on generalising region-specific findings, and the exclusion
    of some socioeconomic factors; The study suggests establishing a climate-resilience
    agricultural fund, focusing on policies of improved income, implementing a climate-resilient
    infrastructure initiative, and prioritizing agricultural research.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Food insecurity (measured as malnutrition prevalence) is studied as an outcome.
  6: Food insecurity (FISEC) is the dependent variable, serving as a proxy for the
    prevalence of malnutrition.
  7: Food prices serve as a proxy for the inflation rate in each West African country,
    with increases indicating worsening food insecurity.
  8: Prevalence of Malnutrition (%) is analyzed in relation to other macroeconomic
    factors.

Quantitative material:
