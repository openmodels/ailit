  1: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Slow onset climate events such as desertification, sea level rise, and loss of
    biodiversity, gradual environmental changes.
  4: Slow onset events related to climate change, fossil fuel subsidy removals or
    carbon pricing, restricting the use of natural resources.
Highlights:
  1: Social protection systems aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
    and the Paris Agreement could be a key policy approach to address increasing risks
    from long-term changes to the climate system.
  4: Highlights the need of institutional transformation programmes for effective
    delivery of dual social and environmental objectives.
Methodology:
  4: The framing of comprehensive risk management of slow onset events is inspired
    by the loss and damage policy framework of Roberts and Pelling [25]. The impact
    areas are defined based on a literature review [8/C15/C15,9/C15/C15].
More Notes:
  1: The paper explores the potential for social protection to address slow onset
    events by looking into the multiple dimensions of vulnerability and resilience,
    and it discusses options for financing such interventions in developing countries.
  4: The page focuses on linking social protection systems with climate risk management,
    highlighting the importance of environmental and climate policies as opportunities
    rather than just risks.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  4: Reducing public budgets for social protection programmes is identified as a potential
    impact of climate change related slow onset events.
