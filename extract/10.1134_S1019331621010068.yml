Drivers of Risk:
  1: Permafrost degradation effects on the housing sector in the Russian Arctic
  2: Global climate change, specifically permafrost thawing and degradation, resulting
    from rising temperatures in the Russian Arctic.
  3: Permafrost thawing and degradation impacting stability of engineering structures,
    particularly in the Russian Arctic.
  4: Permafrost thawing and degradation.
  5: Permafrost thawing and degradation effects on residential buildings due to climate
    change, specifically surface air temperature increases.
  6: Permafrost temperature and thaw depth impacting the stability of housing stock.
  8: Permafrost degradation due to climate change, specifically increasing thaw depth
    and permafrost temperature, leading to loss of bearing capacity of soils.
Highlights:
  1: No relevant information
  2: "Permafrost degradation will lead to significant costs for maintaining and restoring\
    \ housing stock in the Russian Arctic, potentially exceeding \u20BD 36 bln annually\
    \ under a modernization scenario."
  3: More than 300 houses in Norilsk had to be demolished due to deformation from
    permafrost thawing.
  4: Focuses on economic loss to the housing stock in Russian Arctic regions due to
    permafrost degradation by 2050.
  5: The paper forecasts housing stock growth in the Russian Arctic under different
    scenarios considering climate change impacts on permafrost. The most severe climate
    change scenario (RCP8.5) is used to assess maximum risks to residential buildings.
  6: "\u20BD4.1 trillion of housing stock in the studied regions is built on permafrost;\
    \ potential loss to the housing sector is estimated between \u20BD420 billion\
    \ and \u20BD2.5 trillion by 2050 under a conservative scenario."
  8: Permafrost degradation poses significant economic risks to the Russian Arctic,
    potentially costing billions of rubles annually. The Yamalo-Nenets AO and the
    Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) are expected to be the most affected. Adaptation measures,
    including modernization of the construction industry and increased housing construction,
    are crucial.
Methodology:
  1: Economic Assessment of Permafrost Degradation Effects on the Housing Sector in
    the Russian Arctic
  2: Economic assessment and forecasting of the consequences of permafrost thawing
    and degradation on the housing sector in eight regions of the Russian Arctic using
    the most negative (RCP 8.5) IPCC forecast option as a physio-geographic basis.
  4: Economic assessment of permafrost thawing consequences based on total size of
    housing stock and the actual cost of housing construction in each region. The
    methodology uses data from the International Permafrost Association (IPA) for
    estimating the proportion of housing built on permafrost in different zones. Assumes
    constant population in regions until 2050 and unchanged total area of housing
    stock between 2025-2050.
  6: Estimation of housing stock size and cost built on permafrost based on Rosstat
    data and construction costs per square meter; Assessment of decrease in bearing
    capacity of soils using permafrost temperature and thaw depth data derived from
    geotechnical models; Three scenarios (minimum, average, maximum loss of bearing
    capacity) are considered.
  8: The paper forecasts socioeconomic losses in eight regions of the Russian Arctic
    due to permafrost degradation under average and maximum change scenarios of permafrost
    temperature and thaw depth. The analysis seems to focus on the housing sector.
More Notes:
  1: The authors are also working on related projects, including 'Evaluating critical
    thresholds of climate change impacting major regional environmental systems in
    Russia for developing adaptation strategies' and 'Arctic PIRE'.
  2: The analysis focuses on the housing sector in eight specific regions of the Russian
    Arctic. The paper mentions the bearing capacity of permafrost soils decreasing,
    creating risks for the stability of industrial and social infrastructure.
  4: Cadastral or market valuation of housing is deemed unsuitable, the study uses
    the current cost of construction instead. The analysis disregards factors of housing
    demand/supply, living standards, wages, and bank rates/mortgage lending due to
    their long-term uncertainty and dependence on broader economic factors.
  5: The authors acknowledge limitations in statistical accounting of housing stock
    disposal at the municipal level.
  6: "The paper focuses on the economic assessment of permafrost degradation effects\
    \ on the residential stock in specific Russian regions. Regions studied include\
    \ Komi Republic, Nenets AO, Khanty\u2013Mansi AO, Yamalo-Nenets AO, Krasnoyarsk\
    \ krai, Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Magadan oblast, and Chukotka AO. The methodology\
    \ adopted considers scenarios of permafrost thawing and degradation influence\
    \ on the stability of housing and provides forecast estimates of the costs of\
    \ reducing risk for the period up to 2050."
  8: The paper acknowledges that the cost estimates do not include indirect costs,
    such as building reserve housing or costs for temporary evacuation. All values
    are in 2018 prices.

    regions studied for the period up to 2050.
  5: No relevant information
  6: Expected economic loss to the housing sector due to permafrost degradation in

Quantitative material:
  1: No relevant information
  2: "Under a conservative scenario, the annual average cost of maintenance and restoration\
    \ will exceed \u20BD 30 bln (Russian rubles). Under a modernization scenario,\
    \ the cost will increase to \u20BD 36 bln. The maximum expected loss is predicted\
    \ in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug and Krasnoyarsk krai, and the minimum,\
    \ in the Chukotka and Khanty\u2013Mansi autonomous okrugs."
  4: Formulas (1) and (2) for calculating the total size and cost of the housing stock
    built in the permafrost zone. Assumptions of 90%, 50%, 10%, and 0% of housing
    stock built on permafrost in zones of continuous, discontinuous, massive-island,
    and sporadic permafrost respectively. Period of analysis is up to 2050.
  6: "\u20BD4.1 trillion cost of housing stock built on permafrost in the regions\
    \ studied (2018); Expected loss from permafrost degradation (2020-2050) ranges\
    \ from \u20BD420 billion to \u20BD2.5 trillion (conservative scenario)."
  8: "Annual cost of maintaining housing stock could increase to \u20BD95 bln (almost\
    \ 1% of GRP in 2018 prices) under maximum thaw scenario. Total loss for Yamalo-Nenets\
    \ AO estimated at \u20BD416.5 bln. Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) could face \u20BD\
    1.7 trillion loss under maximum decrease in bearing capacity. Expected loss from\
    \ permafrost thawing and degradation estimated in the range from \u20BD500 bln\
    \ to \u20BD3.36 trillion. Average annual loss from 2020-2050 is estimated at \u20BD\
    36.26 bln (0.29% of GRP in 2018 prices) under average change and \u20BD112 bln\
    \ under maximum change. Additional housing construction needs could range from\
    \ 243,000 m2 to 1.5 mln m2 annually."
