Drivers of Risk:
  1: "El Ni\xF1o events (delayed rainfall); natural climate variability; changes in\
    \ the mean climate (increasing greenhouse gases)."
  2: "Delayed monsoon onset, particularly due to El Ni\xF1o events, disrupts rice\
    \ planting and harvesting cycles."
  3: Changes in mean temperature, large-scale dynamical circulation in the tropics,
    and greenhouse gas emissions leading to regional and seasonal distribution changes
    of rainfall.
  4: Climate change impacts such as delayed monsoon onset and changes in seasonal
    rainfall patterns affecting rice agriculture and food security.
  5: Increased temperatures, increased CO2 concentrations, changes in precipitation
    (delayed monsoon onset, altered rainfall patterns), lower soil moisture.
Highlights:
  1: Marked increase in the probability of a 30-day delay in monsoon onset in 2050;
    Changes in annual precipitation cycle suggest increase later in the crop year
    and a substantial decrease later in the dry season; adaptation strategies needed,
    including increased investments in water storage, drought-tolerant crops, crop
    diversification, and early warning systems.
  2: Delayed monsoon onset significantly impacts rice production in Java and Bali,
    with potential consequences for domestic and international rice markets, especially
    for poor net consumers of rice.
  3: The likelihood of exceeding the 30-day monsoon onset delay threshold increases
    significantly relative to the current period under projected climate changes.
    Uncertainty in the response of large-scale circulation patterns to climate forcing
    is a significant factor in model projections. There is a substantially greater
    likelihood of exceeding the threshold for many models in their analysis.
  4: Projected changes in rainfall patterns could delay monsoon onset, impacting agricultural
    planting cycles and water availability, potentially increasing dry conditions.
  5: Increased temperatures decrease rice yields. Changes in rainfall patterns, particularly
    delayed monsoon onset, impact rice production. Adaptation measures such as rice
    policy adjustments, water storage, drought-tolerant rice varieties, and crop diversification
    are important for food security.
Methodology:
  1: Risk assessment framework using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change AR4
    climate models, scaled to the regional level with empirical downscaling models;
    compares present vs. future likelihood of exceeding a seasonal climate threshold
    (delayed monsoon onset); examines potential changes in the annual cycle of precipitation;
    focuses on West and Central Java and East Java and Bali; results applicable to
    Indonesian rice agriculture and food security in 2050.
  2: Onset is defined as the number of days after August 1 when cumulative rainfall
    reaches 20 cm, and delay is defined as the number of days past the mean onset
    date (1979-2004).
  3: Uses Global Climate Models (GCMs) from the IPCC AR4 report, downscaled with empirical
    downscaling models (EDMs) to estimate regional precipitation. Employs a bottom-up
    approach focusing on the vulnerability of rice agriculture to a range of climate
    outcomes, rather than a specific forecast. Multimodel ensembles are used to create
    probability distributions of future precipitation and determine the likelihood
    of exceeding climate thresholds for rice agriculture. Results are applicable to
    2050 under specific emissions scenarios.
  4: The analysis uses probability distributions for monsoon onset and rainfall changes
    projected by 15 GCMs under A2 scenarios, using multiple EDMs.
  5: Uses least-squares regression models to relate crop production variables to observed
    precipitation from 1979 to 2004. Calculates threshold variables by identifying
    climate variables with clear effects on rice productivity, selecting a threshold
    beyond which the loss in productivity was significant, and determining the probability
    of exceeding this threshold under current and future (2050) climate conditions.
    Also uses Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDMs) to project future precipitation patterns
    over Java and Bali for 2050.
More Notes:
  1: "Agricultural production in Indonesia is strongly influenced by annual and interannual\
    \ variations in precipitation caused by the Austral-Asia monsoon and El Ni\xF1\
    o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dynamics."
  2: The study focuses on the impact of monsoon delays on rice production in specific
    regions of Indonesia, relating it to total Indonesian rice production (2004) on
    a region by region basis, and does not account for other elements of the Indonesian
    macroeconomy.
  4: The study emphasizes that increased AMJ rainfall won't offset reduced JAS rainfall,
    suggesting a higher risk to crops.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Annual rice deficits; food security (availability and access to staple food commodities).
  2: Rice production declines in Indonesia, specifically West/Central Java and East
    Java/Bali, due to monsoon delays.
  3: Impacts on wet- and dry-season rice crops due to precipitation changes.
  4: There is no specific mention of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes or economic
    costs and benefits on this page.
  5: Rice yields and rice production are affected by climate change (temperature,
    CO2 concentrations, precipitation).
Quantitative material:
  1: Increase in the probability of a 30-day delay in monsoon onset from 9-18% today
    to 30-40% in 2050; precipitation increases later in the crop year (April-June)
    of up to 110-150%, but a substantial decrease (up to 75% at the tail) in precipitation
    later in the dry season (July-September).
  2: A 20% drop in rainfall during April-June reduces the corresponding planting area
    for Java and Bali by only 2%.
  3: Probability distributions of exceeding a 30-day monsoon onset delay threshold
    in 2050, by region (West/Central Java and East Java/Bali), EDM, and emissions
    scenario (A2 and B1). Includes specific probability ranges for threshold exceedance
    under different scenarios and models, compared to current probabilities.
  4: Probability distributions of exceeding the 30-day monsoon threshold for East
    Java, Bali, and West/Central Java regions by 2050 under different scenarios.
  5: "For every 1\xB0C increase in minimum temperature, rice yields decrease by 10%."
