Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts, particularly on agriculture as the dominant water user.
  2: The study examines the relative impacts of different climate (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5)
    and socioeconomic (SSPs 1, 2, 3, and 5) scenarios on freshwater use.
  6: Climate change impacts domestic water withdrawals through changes in precipitation
    and potential evapotranspiration.
  8: Temperature changes impact electricity use, specifically increasing space-cooling
    demands.
  9: Changes in temperature (climate change).
  10: Population growth, climate change (leading to decreased precipitation), and
    changes in industrial water use efficiency.
  11: Climate change impacts on water availability (precipitation changes) affect
    industrial and thermoelectric water use.
  12: Warmer temperatures associated with climate change could increase water use
    for power generation; Rising temperatures could increase thermoelectric water
    use; Declines in precipitation due to climate change will need to be offset by
    increases in irrigation rates.
  13: Climate change (particularly under RCP 8.5) and socioeconomic pathways (SSP
    scenarios) drive changes in water consumptive use. Population growth affects water
    demand for livestock.
  14: Climate change (wet, dry, middle climate models), socioeconomic factors (population
    growth, technology, energy demand).
Highlights:
  1: Dry regions could see major increases in freshwater use, while wetter climate
    models predict a decrease in water use even under high emissions and population
    growth.
  6: The study projects future water withdrawals and consumptive use across different
    sectors, considering the impact of climate change on domestic and agricultural
    sectors.
  8: Shifts in energy sources and efficiency improvements may reduce water consumption
    for thermoelectric generation.
  9: Long-term effects on electricity consumption are smallest in hotter, southern
    areas and increase moving north, with exceptions (e.g., WRR 17 including Washington
    state).
  10: Climate change compounds the effects of population, potentially leading to more
    water use as households offset decreases in precipitation with increases in water
    withdrawals for outdoor use. Industrial water withdrawals have been declining
    due to improved water efficiency and structural changes in the U.S. economy.
  11: Thermoelectric water consumption is projected to increase significantly by 2070,
    with the South Atlantic-Gulf region expected to dominate the share of thermoelectric
    water consumption in the United States.
  12: Climate change could significantly increase water use for power generation and
    irrigation, particularly in the West; Adaptation will be most needed in the Western
    river basins due to already appropriated water resources.
  13: Total consumptive water use is projected to vary significantly based on climate
    and socioeconomic scenarios, with agriculture being a dominant factor, particularly
    in the Intermountain region.
  14: Aggregate impacts of climate and socioeconomic changes depend on which future
    the U.S. sees; national averages mask regional challenges; water use improvements
    have been made but future innovation is needed.
Methodology:
  1: Projections based on socioeconomic and climate scenarios from the IPCC Fifth
    Assessment Report paired with five climate models.
  2: The study projects future freshwater use by extrapolating past trends of withdrawal
    rates and applying those rates to projections of water-using units (population,
    acres irrigated). This approach is intentionally less complex than traditional
    economic demand modeling to maintain transparency and limit assumptions.
  6: Future livestock water withdrawals are projected based on WRR population, with
    withdrawal rates calculated as gallons per person. Domestic water withdrawals
    are modelled as a function of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration.
  8: The analysis projects net electric energy production and water consumption by
    projecting future per-capita electricity demand, energy region demand allocation,
    and adjusting for temperature effects on electricity consumption.
  9: The paper estimates electricity consumption changes based on temperature variations
    and applies these changes across Water Resource Regions (WRRs) within the contiguous
    United States. It considers both short-term and long-term effects and accounts
    for different electricity consumption patterns in residential and commercial sectors.
    The analysis also incorporates regional variations in water usage.
  10: The study projects changes in water use based on climate models and population
    trends.
  11: The analysis projects future water use in industrial and thermoelectric sectors
    based on scenarios of socioeconomic and climatic outcomes, projecting forward
    to 2070 with 2015 as a baseline.
  12: Projections of water consumption for thermoelectric power generation and irrigation
    are made out to 2070, based on different scenarios and climate models; Analysis
    considers changes in irrigation depth, irrigated acres, and water withdrawal rates.
  13: Projections of consumptive water use are made under different RCP and SSP scenarios,
    taking into account sector-specific water use (agriculture, livestock, aquaculture)
    and regional variations.
  14: Climate model projections combined with socioeconomic scenarios (SSP5, RCP 8.5)
    to project water use.
More Notes:
  6: The study focuses on projecting desired water use without considering water supply
    constraints, noting that such constraints would be needed for vulnerability analysis.
  9: The paper utilizes data on residential and commercial electricity consumption
    percentages to develop a multiplier for calculating changes in electricity consumption
    due to temperature changes.
  11: The industrial sector's water use is influenced by both overall economic growth
    and the specific growth of water-intensive manufacturing. Thermoelectric water
    use is affected by energy efficiency gains and overall electricity demand, and
    technology adoption (e.g., cooling systems).
  12: The paper focuses on water use across different sectors (thermoelectric, irrigation,
    livestock/aquaculture) and its relation to climate change, rather than macroeconomic
    variables; The projections provided are sector-specific, and an economy-wide analysis
    is not done here.
  13: The impact of climate change on livestock water demand isn't included in projections,
    only variations by SSP are considered.
  14: The study assumes water supply is not a limiting factor in water use, which
    may not be realistic in many regions; constrained by water availability, significant
    adaptation measures will be needed.

    demand for thermoelectric power is projected to increase by at least 150% for
    moderate growth scenarios and by over 400% for extreme cases.

    \ in 2070."
  14: Under the best-case scenario, water use decreases by 8%, but under the worst-case
    scenario water use increases by 235%.
