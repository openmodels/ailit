Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change is impacting freshwater use, with dry and hot climate conditions
    increasing the demand for water more than socioeconomic factors, due to agriculture
    being the dominant water use.
  2: Climate change (warmer global temperatures represented by RCP 8.5 and less-warm
    future by RCP 4.5), socioeconomic changes (population growth, income levels represented
    by SSPs 1, 2, 3, and 5), water use per capita and irrigation depth.
  3: Projected increases in potential evapotranspiration (PET) and changes in precipitation
    patterns.
  5: Past trends in water withdrawal rates, future growth rates (g) and decay rates
    (d) of those trends. Annual weather fluctuations are also mentioned as a factor
    potentially causing erratic data.
  6: The analysis considers changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration
    as drivers of water withdrawals in the domestic sector.
  7: "Changes in effective precipitation (\u0394P\u2019) and potential evapotranspiration\
    \ (\u0394ETp) during the growing season drive changes in water withdrawals. The\
    \ study also considers thermoelectric plants' fuel consumption, net electricity\
    \ generation, water availability, and cooling system types as drivers."
  8: Increases in temperature affecting space-cooling demand are key drivers of changes
    in thermoelectric water use.
  9: Increases in temperature and population growth, particularly in the driest and
    southern parts of the U.S., are the primary drivers impacting electricity consumption
    and domestic water use.
  10: Climate change compounds effects of population, leading to increased water withdrawals
    for outdoor use to offset precipitation decreases; improvements in water efficiency
    and structural changes in the U.S. economy.
  11: Decreased precipitation, socioeconomic growth scenarios, and changes in electricity
    demand.
  12: Warmer temperatures, climate change, more drastic weather changes, rising temperatures,
    growing population, more frequent drought, declines in precipitation.
  13: Climate impacts (particularly under RCP 8.5) and SSP scenarios (population growth,
    economic development).
  15: Uncertainty in future drivers of water use (climate, population), changing water
    use patterns, economic shifts (declines in manufacturing), and drought conditions
    are impacting water withdrawal.
  16: Changes in the spatial patterns of precipitation, water yield, and potential
    evapotranspiration
  17: Projected changes in annual precipitation under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate
    scenarios are identified as drivers of risk.
  19: Future climate change, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5

    due to climate projections.
  5: Water withdrawal rates are being evaluated.
  6: The page discusses projecting future water withdrawals and consumptive use across
    various sectors, including domestic, livestock, and thermoelectric power, but
    focuses more on water use rather than broader impacts like mortality or productivity
    loss.
  7: The study evaluates changes in domestic (DOM) and irrigation water withdrawals
    due to climate change, as well as thermoelectric freshwater use.
  9: The paper evaluates the change in thermoelectric energy production and water
    usage impacts due to climate change in the United States.

    al. (2013) against actual 2015 water withdrawal data from USGS circulars.
  16: No relevant information
  19: Spatial changes in 30-year average of annual potential evapotranspiration in
    response to future climate change
Highlights:
  1: The analysis found significant variances in water use based on climate models,
    with climate change impacts having a larger effect than population growth due
    to the prominence of agricultural water use.
  3: Consistent model projections show increased water yield in the western U.S. and
    decreased yield in the South due to higher PET driven by warmer temperatures.
  7: The new USGS approach provides estimates of both water withdrawal and consumption
    for thermoelectric plants, eliminating the need to rely on consumptive use proportions
    from older USGS water use circulars. The estimates of water use at freshwater
    thermoelectric plants produced by the new approach are similar to those produced
    using the older approach for the U.S. as a whole, but show some differences at
    smaller scales (WRRs and basins).
  9: Water use for thermoelectric power is significant in the East, while agriculture
    dominates in the West; domestic water use has decreased despite population growth,
    but could increase in the future due to population trends.
  10: Population drives most domestic water use, but climate models differ on climate
    change impacts.
  11: The northern and southern Great Plains see large increases in industrial water
    use under the high growth scenario, in regions projected to see decreased precipitation
    and increased likelihood of shortage in some climate scenarios; thermoelectric
    consumptive water use is projected to see annual increases out to 2070.
  12: Warmer temperatures could increase water use for power generation significantly.
    Water use for irrigation is projected to increase overall, particularly in the
    East.
  13: Agriculture is the dominant water user, so results vary by climate model more
    than SSP, especially under RCP 8.5. The Intermountain region sees large increases
    in water use, especially under higher growth scenarios due to livestock and population
    growth.
  15: Brown et al. (2013) projections overestimated water withdrawal by about 20%
    nationally. Overestimates were largest for WRRs 4 and 5 (Great Lakes and Ohio
    regions); underestimates were largest for WRRs 2 and 16 (Mid-Atlantic and Great
    Basin regions).
  16: No relevant information
  17: RCP 8.5 predicts more severe changes in precipitation patterns across the United
    States compared to RCP 4.5. End-century projections show greater changes than
    mid-century projections in both scenarios.
  19: Maps indicate potential evapotranspiration changes for the US under different
    climate scenarios. RCP 8.5 shows more widespread and substantial increases compared
    to RCP 4.5. End-century projections show more pronounced increases than mid-century
    projections.
Methodology:
  1: Projections are based on socioeconomic and climate scenarios from the IPCC Fifth
    Assessment Report and use five climate models from the downscaled Multivariate
    Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA).
  2: The analysis extrapolates past trends of water withdrawal rates and applies them
    to projections of water-using units. It uses SSPs and RCPs to examine the impacts
    of climate and socioeconomic forces. The analysis focuses on the Continental United
    States (CONUS).
  3: Uses climate projections and models; employs the Penman-Monteith equation to
    calculate potential evapotranspiration.
  4: Future climate change effects are estimated by projecting temperature, evapotranspiration,
    and precipitation, while past water withdrawal trends are extrapolated assuming
    no climate impact.
  5: Past trends in water withdrawal rates are extrapolated using annual growth rates
    and decay rates, leading to an equilibrium level. Growth and decay rates are calculated
    using withdrawal data from 1985 to 2015, split into eastern and western divisions
    based on Water Resource Regions (WRR). Future water withdrawal is projected at
    the county level, using factors specified at larger spatial scales (WRR).
  6: Future water withdrawals for livestock are projected based on human population
    at the WRR (presumably Water Resource Region) spatial scale, apportioned to individual
    counties based on past withdrawals. Domestic sector water use is projected considering
    precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Most sectors use an average of
    the three most recent estimates (currently the estimates for years 2005, 2010,
    and 2015).
  7: The analysis computes changes in domestic and irrigation water withdrawals based
    on changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. The change in irrigation
    withdrawals is calculated under the assumption that irrigation completely satisfies
    plant water requirements. Thermoelectric freshwater use is projected using a new
    USGS approach that models the heat and water budgets of individual thermoelectric
    plants based on EIA data on fuel consumption and net electricity generation. Separate
    functions are used for different electricity generation and cooling system types.
    The study focuses on 1,101 freshwater thermoelectric plants with a generating
    capacity of at least 1 MW.
  8: Short-term and long-term electrical use impacts are analyzed by estimating temperature
    effects using a multiplier for per-capita electricity consumption, incorporating
    past temperatures and state-specific regression equations.
  9: The analysis involves estimating short-term and long-term impacts on electricity
    consumption using coefficients for different WRRs and comparing historical water
    usage trends against population growth projections.
  13: Projections based on RCP and SSP scenarios, focusing on agriculture, livestock,
    and aquaculture water demand. Livestock projections do not include climate effects.
  15: Compares 2015 water withdrawal projections from Brown et al. (2013) with 2015
    water withdrawal data from USGS circulars. The projections used population and
    income projections downscaled to the county-scale.
  16: "Uses the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model at the 4 \xD7\
    \ 4 km spatial resolution to project changes in precipitation, water yield, and\
    \ potential evapotranspiration under MACA models and RCPs."
  17: The analysis projects climate changes under two scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5)
    for mid-century and end-century, presenting spatial changes in 30-year averages
    of annual precipitation.
  19: Analysis projects changes in potential evapotranspiration under RCP 4.5 and
    RCP 8.5 for mid-century and end-century timeframes.
More Notes:
  1: National trends mask significant regional differences in water usage, with some
    regions facing increasing water shortages due to combined socioeconomic and climate
    factors.
  5: The analysis relies on Water Resource Regions (WRRs) and divides the US into
    eastern (WRRs 1-9) and western (WRRs 10-18) divisions for calculating growth and
    decay rates. Baseline values are averages of the most recent three estimates to
    reduce the impact of fluctuations.
  10: Figure 4 shows 2015 water withdrawals for each sector by state. Figure 5 shows
    the mean and standard deviation in percent change in domestic water consumption
    across scenarios.
  13: Consumptive use rates vary by region (e.g., 77% in California vs. 28% in Wyoming
    for agriculture). Aquaculture water withdrawals are concentrated in Idaho, North
    Carolina, California, and Oregon.
  15: WRRs 9 and 13 have several missing data points that prevent meaningful comparisons.
  16: No relevant information
  19: Data used will be archived in the US Forest Service Research Data Archive.
Quantitative material:
  1: Projections indicate freshwater use could decrease by 8% under the best-case
    scenario and increase by 235% under the worst-case scenario.
  2: The study mentions using five climate models from the downscaled Multivariate
    Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) and projects population and income at the
    county level.
  3: The paper provides percent changes in surface freshwater withdrawals from 2005
    to 2015, and qualitative increases or decreases in water yield.
  5: Formulas (3) and (4) describe the calculation of water withdrawal rates, including
    annual growth rate (g) and decay rate (d). The projection uses a 5-year time step.
  6: The page presents equations for calculating consumptive water use and the change
    in per capita water withdrawals in the domestic sector due to climate change.
    It mentions that 11% of US domestic beef production was exported in 2020.
  7: "The study uses constants \u03B7P = -1.415 (change in DOM gallons per capita\
    \ per day withdrawn for a 1 cm increase in P\u2019) and \u03B7ETp = 0.778 (change\
    \ in DOM gallons per capita per day withdrawn for a 1 cm increase in ETp).  It\
    \ also uses a conversion factor \u03D1 = 0.0328 (feet per centimeter) for calculating\
    \ irrigation water use. The study also refers to using heat and water budgets\
    \ of 1,274 individual thermoelectric utility plants."
  9: The paper provides coefficients for computing changes in electricity consumption
    due to temperature increases and discusses percent change in domestic water use.
  10: Industrial water withdrawals have been declining at an annualized rate of 1.8%
    since at least 1985; 78% of counties are projected to see decreases in domestic
    water use.
  11: Mean percent change in industrial water consumption across scenarios; standard
    deviation in percent change in industrial water consumption across scenarios;
    thermoelectric consumptive water use is projected to see annual increases out
    to 2070; per-capita electricity demand for thermoelectric power is projected to
    increase by at least 150% for moderate growth scenarios and by over 400% for extreme
    cases; thermoelectric water consumption is projected to rise from just under 2.5
    billion gallons of water per day in 2015 to between 5 and 17 billion gallons per
    day, depending on the combination of socioeconomic and climatic outcomes; East
    accounted for roughly 74% of thermoelectric consumptive water use in 2015, expected
    to fall to 71% by 2070.
  12: "Warmer temperatures could increase water use for power generation by 20%\u2013\
    60%, depending on the scenario. Rising temperatures could increase thermoelectric\
    \ water use by an extra 6 billion gallons per day in extreme cases. Irrigation\
    \ depth decreased from 2.5 feet per year (1985-2010) to nearly 2 feet in 2015.\
    \ Irrigation rates in the West are falling consistently at an annualized rate\
    \ of 0.85% between 1985 and 2015. Total water used for irrigation in the United\
    \ States is projected to increase from 116 billion gallons in 2015 to 134 billion\
    \ gallons in 2070."
  13: Total consumptive use is projected to decrease by as much as 8% in the RCP 4.5
    - SSP1 scenario and increase by 235% in the RCP 8.5 - SSP 5 scenario. In the Intermountain
    region, RCP 8.5 projections lead to total consumptive use nearly twice as high
    in the dry scenario as in the wet scenario.
  15: Across all watersheds in the United States, the A1B scenario projected about
    20% more water withdrawn in 2015 than was reported by the USGS. Figure 11 shows
    the ratio projections to USGS circular data by water resource region (WRR).
