  7: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  2: Portuguese warm-dry summers critically limit crop growth, mainly due to summertime
    low water availability; extreme winter/spring weather events, such as hail and
    frost, tend to occur in some northern regions and to infringe important damages
    to this crop.
  7: Weather data (temperature, rainfall, solar radiation), soil parameters, management
    decisions, climate change

Highlights:

Methodology:
  7: Dynamic crop models (specifically STICS) are used to simulate crop growth and
    development under different conditions and stresses. STICS runs on a daily time-step
    and uses climate, soil, and crop system variables as input to simulate crop growth,
    water and nitrogen balances, and provides yield and development parameters as
    output.
  8: The STICS model is used to simulate grapevine yield and quality attributes, soil
    water balance, climate change impact assessment, crop practices, soil management,
    and risks of pests/diseases.
More Notes:
  2: The paper provides a general overview of the viticulture sector in Portugal,
    emphasizing its economic importance and the climatic challenges it faces. It highlights
    the risk of extreme weather events, and water scarcity due to warm and dry summers.
    There is no assessment of costs and benefits of adaptation at a national level
    on this page.
  7: The STICS model, adapted for grapevines, can be used for climate change impact
    assessment.
  8: The STICS model requires soil characteristics, plant parameters, general parameters,
    and crop management as inputs. Climate and initializations are inputs to the model.
    The outputs are yield/production, phenological timings, and biomass.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Viticulture and winemaking socioeconomic sector play a key role in Portugal's
    economic growth; exports account for nearly 2% of national export income.

Quantitative Material:
  2: Vineyard area in Portugal is over 229 kha, with an annual wine production of
    about 6.7 Mhl (OIV, 2013); Table wines represent 55% of the total national exports,
    followed by DO wines with 36%, which include fortified wines, such as Port wine
    as well as Regional wines with 12%; Douro/Porto is the main region, with almost
    1.5 Mhl in 2013, approximately corresponding to 25% of all wine produced in Portugal
    (IVV, 2013); Alentejo is the highest yielding region, with an average production
    of 49 hl/ha.
