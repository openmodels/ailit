Drivers of Risk:
  1: Persistent changes in temperature above or below historical norms, variability
    of climate conditions.
  2: Deviations of temperature and precipitation from long-term moving-average historical
    norms (climate change altering weather patterns), weather shocks (positive or
    negative).
  4: Increases in temperature, climate variability, temperature and precipitation
    relative to historical norms
  5: Deviations of temperature and precipitation from their historical norms.
  7: Temperature increases are the primary driver impacting GDP growth.
  8: Persistent increases in annual temperatures above their norms due to climate
    change.
  9: Climate change represented by temperature deviations from historical norms.
  10: Increases in average global temperature, climate variability, RCP scenarios
    (2.6 and 8.5).
  11: Annual increases in temperatures, deviation of temperature from historical norms,
    climate variability
  12: Persistent increases in temperatures based on RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
  13: Schlenker and Auffhammer (2018) mention the cost of a warming climate, suggesting
    climatic changes as a driver of risk.
Drivers_of_Risk:
  6: Climate change, specifically deviations in temperature and precipitation from
    historical norms.
Highlights:
  1: Persistent temperature increases could significantly reduce global GDP per capita;
    adhering to Paris Agreement goals significantly reduces potential losses.
  2: A series of positive (or negative) weather shocks has a long-term negative effect
    on per capita GDP growth.
  4: Higher temperature increases are generally associated with greater GDP per capita
    losses, varying by country group (hot vs. cold countries); most studies predict
    a negative impact on GDP as temperatures increase; ARDL approach is valid regardless
    of whether the underlying variables are I(0) or I(1) and is robust to omitted
    variables bias and bi-directional feedback effects.
  5: Long-run economic growth is adversely affected when temperature deviates from
    its time-varying historical norm. Deviations of precipitation from historical
    norms are not statistically significant. Bias correction (HPJ-FE) is important
    to avoid underestimation of climate change effects.
  6: Negative impact of temperature deviations from historical norms on GDP growth
    is statistically significant; adaptation may be insufficient.
  7: No significant differential impacts of climate change on GDP growth across income
    levels (rich vs poor) or climates (hot vs cold).
  8: Persistent temperature deviations from historical norms have a negative effect
    on long-run per capita GDP growth. Negative growth effects of weather shocks may
    be less severe in cold climates. Poor countries are disproportionately affected
    by weather shocks, but rich countries are not immune.
  9: Significant negative effects of temperature deviations from historical norms
    on GDP growth, especially in temperate/hot and poor countries.
  10: Persistent increase in global temperature leads to substantial output losses.
    Climate change adaptation could reduce, but is unlikely to offset entirely, the
    negative economic effects. Climate volatility significantly increases GDP per
    capita losses.
  11: Persistent temperature changes above norms have long-term negative impacts on
    economic growth, but the effect varies by country; Adaptation is unlikely to fully
    offset negative growth effects.
  12: Under RCP 8.5 scenario by 2100, GDP per capita loss is projected to reach 17.19%
    for the United States, and 16.92% for India.
Methodology:
  1: Study uses a stochastic growth model with panel data from 174 countries from
    1960 to 2014, analyzing effects of temperature and precipitation deviations from
    historical norms.
  2: Theoretical growth model linking deviations of temperature and precipitation
    to per capita real output growth, empirical application allowing for dynamics
    and feedback, distinction between level and growth effects, consideration of asymmetric
    weather effects, testing for differential impact of weather shocks across climates,
    half-panel Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE) estimator.
  4: Panel ARDL model with country-specific fixed effects; ARDL growth regressions
    in deviations form using temperature and precipitation relative to their long-term
    moving average historical norms; historical norms computed using 30 year moving
    averages or with m=20 and m=40; OLS estimates of short-run coefficients to calculate
    long-run effects
  5: Panel ARDL regression with fixed effects (FE) and half-panel Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE)
    estimator. Analysis uses moving averages of past 20, 30 and 40 years for climate
    norms.
  6: "Analysis uses fixed effects (FE) and half-panel Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE) methods\
    \ to estimate the effects of climate variables on GDP over 1960\u20132014."
  7: Analysis performed using ARDL specification; panel data models with interactive
    terms; use of half-panel Jackknife Mean Group (HPJ-MG) estimator for heterogeneity
    analysis.
  8: Uses an ARDL specification with fixed effects (FE) and HPJ-FE (Hodrick-Prescott
    Filter with Fixed Effects) to estimate the impact of temperature deviations on
    GDP growth from 1960-2014. Counterfactual simulations project future GDP growth
    under different climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 8.5, and historical trend) by
    comparing output trajectories with and without temperature changes.

    under mitigated and unmitigated scenarios (2015-2100).
  12: Analysis involves comparing GDP per capita losses using PPP weighted averages
    corresponding to years 2030, 2050, and 2100, considering RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
  13: Pesaran et al. (1995, 1997, 1999) discuss methods for estimating long-run relationships
    using dynamic panels and cointegration analysis, indicating econometric approaches
    to analyzing data.
More Notes:
  2: The paper critiques the use of trended temperature data in growth regressions
    due to spurious trends, and emphasizes the importance of modeling deviations from
    historical norms. The paper mentions a need to account for bi-directional feedback
    effects between growth and climate change using the DICE model.
  4: References data from Tol (2009, 2014), Burke et al. (2015), International Monetary
    Fund (2017), World Development Indicators database of the World Bank; the use
    of ARDL growth regressions in deviations form is used to prevent trends in the
    data which is not present in the data.
  5: The study finds little evidence of asymmetry in the long-run relationship between
    output growth and positive or negative deviations of temperature from its historical
    norm.
  8: The analysis focuses on temperature changes and acknowledges that similar analysis
    could be done for precipitation. The impact of climate change depends on the magnitude
    of temperature changes. The model considers the trend change in temperature over
    time.
  10: The effects are somewhat larger than those obtained in existing studies.
  11: The income effects vary significantly across countries depending on temperature
    increases and climate variability. Cold and/or rich countries exhibit lower marginal
    weather effects.
More_Notes:
  6: Adaptation appears concentrated in certain countries/sectors; global adaptation
    may not be keeping pace with climate change.

Quantitative material:
  1: "Per-capita real GDP is projected to be reduced by over 7 percent by 2100 due\

    to thousands of percent in some countries, to losses of over 80% in others.

    \ based on temperature increases; shaded area shows GDP per capita losses based\
    \ on m=20 and m=40 (climate variability); temperature increase (2014\u20132099)\
    \ vs. GDP per capita loss (%); GDP impact as a percentage ranging from -30% to\
    \ 10% with respect to an increase in temperature from 0 to 5 degrees Celsius."
  5: "A 0.01 \u25E6C annual increase in temperature above its historical norm reduces\
    \ real GDP per capita growth by 0.0577 percentage points per year. A 0.01 \u25E6\
