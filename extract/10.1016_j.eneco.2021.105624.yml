Drivers of Risk:
  1: Persistent changes in temperature above or below historical norms are identified
    as drivers impacting economic outcomes.
  2: Deviations of temperature and precipitation from their long-term moving-average
    historical norms (climate).
  3: Persistent deviations of temperature from historical norms, the pace of temperature
    increases, and climate variability are drivers of risk.
  4: Temperature increase is identified as the primary driver affecting GDP per capita,
    with emphasis on differentiating impacts on hot and cold countries.
  5: Deviations of temperature and precipitation from historical norms
  6: Temperature and precipitation relative to historical norms.
  7: Temperature increases are the primary driver of risk analyzed.
  8: Persistent increases in annual temperatures above historical norms are identified
    as the primary drivers impacting GDP growth.
  9: Temperature changes (relative to historical norms) and temperature volatility.
  10: Climate change impacts include increased global temperatures and climate variability
    affecting economies worldwide.
  11: Annual increases in temperature, both under mitigated (RCP 2.6) and unmitigated
    (RCP 8.5) scenarios; country-specific climate variability
  12: Persistent increases in temperatures based on the RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios
Evaluation overview:
  1: The study evaluates the long-term impact of climate change on economic activity
    and per-capita real output growth across countries.
  2: This paper investigates the long-term macroeconomic effects of weather patterns
    transformed by climate change across 174 countries over the period 1960 to 2014,
    focusing on the impact of deviations of temperature and precipitation from their
    long-term moving-average historical norms on per capita real output growth.
  3: Economic growth and real GDP per capita are evaluated.
  4: The paper evaluates the impact of temperature increase on GDP per capita, indicating
    economic losses by the year 2100.
  5: GDP per capita growth
  6: Impact of climate change on per capita real GDP growth.
  7: This paper evaluates the long-run growth effects of weather shocks on economic
    performance, specifically per capita real GDP growth.
  8: The analysis focuses on the long-run effects of climate change on per capita
    real GDP growth, particularly for poor and hot countries.
  9: "The long-run effects of climate change on per capita real GDP growth, 1960\u2013\
    2014."
  10: The paper evaluates the impact of climate change on per capita real GDP growth
    from 1960 to 2014, with projections under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
  11: GDP per capita loss by 2100
  12: Percent loss in GDP per capita
Highlights:
  1: Per-capita real output growth is adversely affected by temperature deviations,
    and the effects vary across climates and income groups, with possible global GDP
    losses up to 13 percent if climate variability increases.
  2: A series of positive (or negative) weather shocks has a long-term negative effect
    on per capita GDP growth.
  3: Persistent temperature increases negatively affect economic growth, even in rich
    or cold countries, due to factors such as the pace of warming and climate variability.
    Unmitigated climate change (RCP 8.5) leads to substantial reductions in global
    GDP per capita by 2100.
  4: Higher temperature increases generally correlate with greater GDP losses by 2100,
    with significant differences observed between hot and cold countries.
  5: Long-run economic growth is adversely affected when temperature deviates from
    its time-varying historical norm persistently.
  6: Temperature deviations negatively impact per capita real GDP growth. The study
    calculates the long-run effects of climate variables on GDP growth based on short-run
    coefficient estimates.
  7: The initial analysis found no statistically significant differential effects
    of climate change on poor versus rich nations or hot versus cold countries, though
    this may be due to a lack of statistical power.
  8: Hot countries experience more severe growth effects from weather shocks compared
    to cold countries; poor countries are disproportionately affected by these shocks.
  9: Temperature increases relative to historical norms are generally associated with
    reduced per capita real GDP growth.
  10: Significant GDP per capita losses are expected globally under RCP 8.5, with
    mitigation helping limit future damages; adaptation alone is insufficient to offset
    all losses.
  11: Persistent changes in temperature above time-varying norms have long-term negative
    impacts on economic growth; income losses vary across climates and income groups,
    but are sizable even in cold climates. Adaptation is unlikely to fully offset
    negative growth effects. Policy responses, including mitigation and adaptation,
    are needed.
  12: Under RCP 8.5, the United States could experience a GDP per capita loss of 6.66%
    to 14.32% by 2100, depending on the parameter 'm'.
Methodology:
  1: The study uses a stochastic growth model to assess the impact of deviations in
    temperature and precipitation from historical norms over the years 1960 to 2014,
    using a panel data set of 174 countries.
  2: "The paper develops a theoretical growth model that links deviations of temperature\
    \ and precipitation (weather) from their long-term moving-average historical norms\
    \ (climate) to per capita real output growth. The empirical application allows\
    \ for dynamics and feedback effects, distinguishes between level and growth effects,\
    \ considers asymmetric weather effects, and tests for differential impact of weather\
    \ shocks across climates. They use the half-panel Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE) estimator\
    \ to deal with potential bias. The analysis covers the period 1960\u20132014."
  3: Panel regressions are used to link temperature changes to income growth, controlling
    for historical trends. Counterfactual exercises are performed to investigate the
    cumulative income effects of annual temperature increases from 2015-2100 under
    different RCP scenarios.
  4: Uses an ARDL model with data on temperature and precipitation deviations from
    historical norms, focusing on long-term economic growth impacts.
  5: Panel ARDL regression with fixed effects (FE) and half-panel Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE)
    estimator to address bias. Uses lag order p=4. Focuses on long-run estimates.
    Climate norms are constructed as moving averages of the past 20, 30, and 40 years.
  6: "Panel data regressions with fixed effects (FE) and half-panel Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE)\
    \ to correct for bias, using data from 1960-2014. Models include lagged GDP growth\
    \ and climate variables. Two specifications are used: one with both temperature\
    \ and precipitation and one with only temperature. Historical norms are calculated\
    \ over preceding \U0001D45A years (\U0001D45A = 20, 30, 40)."
  7: The study uses ARDL specifications and panel data models to analyze the effects
    of temperature changes on economic growth across countries. They use interactive
    terms to differentiate impacts on poor vs. rich and hot vs. cold countries, and
    a half-panel Jackknife Mean Group (HPJ-MG) estimator. The time periods vary depending
    on the analysis but include 1960-2014 and rolling estimates from 1965-1983.
  8: The analysis uses counterfactual exercises and an autoregressive distributed
    lag model (ARDL) with fixed effects to evaluate the effects of temperature increases
    on GDP growth from 2015 to 2100.
  9: "The study uses a half-panel Jackknife mean-group estimator to estimate the impact\
    \ of temperature changes on real GDP per capita growth. Two specifications are\
    \ used, one including and one excluding the log of world\u2019s real GDP per capita\

  10: The analysis uses a half-panel Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE) procedure to estimate real
    GDP per capita, taking into account temperature deviations from historical norms
    and adaptation speeds.
  11: Panel data analysis using heterogeneous panel data estimates.
  12: "The analysis uses PPP GDP weighted averages (\U0001D451\U0001D456) with \u210E\
    \ = 16, 36, and 86 (corresponding to the year 2030, 2050, and 2100) and \U0001D45A\

More Notes:
  3: Adaptation can reduce negative effects but is unlikely to offset them entirely.
    The study also uses population-weighted climate data to consider localized effects.
  5: The authors find little evidence of asymmetry in the long-run relationship between
    output growth and positive or negative deviations of temperature from its historical
    norm.
  6: The authors investigate whether the estimated coefficients on temperature deviations
    increase in absolute value over time, suggesting limited adaptation. They discuss
    potential reasons for limited adaptation, including concentration of adaptation
    efforts, adaptation not keeping pace with climate change, offsetting structural
    changes, underestimation of risk, and underinvestment due to high cost.
  9: Asterisks in Table 4 indicate statistical significance at the 1% (***), 5% (**),
    and 10% (*) levels.

    scenarios, respectively. The Mercator projection exaggerates areas far from the
    equator.

    \ by 0.04\xB0C per year reduces world real GDP per capita by more than 7 percent\
    \ by 2100, and by about 1 percent if the temperature increase is limited to 0.01\xB0\
