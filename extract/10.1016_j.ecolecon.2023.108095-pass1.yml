Drivers of Risk:
  1: Drought, measured by the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index.
  2: Drought conditions (measured by SPEI).
  5: SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) variations as a measure
    of drought during the growing season.
  6: SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) values, drought
  10: Exposure to drought reduces both the willingness of households to acquire land
    ownership rights and the price households are willing to pay for such rights.
  12: Shifts in seasonal precipitation patterns affect growing seasons, complicating
    agricultural planning.
  14: SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, a measure of drought)
  16: SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) - current, lag 1,
    lag 2, lag 3, and lead, categorized as Dry, Wet, or Normal
  18: Long-term SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index), indicating
    drought conditions.
Highlights:
  1: Drought exposure limits the operating space for farmers wishing to purchase land.
  2: Drought conditions significantly reduce households' willingness to acquire land
    ownership rights and the amount they are willing to pay for land.
  5: The study analyzes the impact of drought conditions during the growing season
    on households' willingness to acquire full ownership rights to land. The SPEI
    values exhibit considerable temporal and some spatial variation in Uganda.
  10: Exposure to drought has a persistent negative effect on land purchase interests
    up to two years after a drought, while above-average water supply increases interest
    in land purchases.
  14: SPEI (current) has a statistically significant positive effect on willingness
    to acquire land ownership rights.
  16: Significant effects of SPEI on willingness to purchase land and the amount households
    are willing to pay are found, particularly for current and lagged SPEI values.
    Both continuous and categorical SPEI measures are used.
  18: 'A negative and statistically significant relationship is found between drought
    (SPEI: dry) and both willingness to purchase land and the amount households are
    willing to pay for land.'
Methodology:
  1: Household fixed effects approach, using spatial and temporal variation in drought
    conditions combined with three waves of the Uganda National Panel Survey.
  2: Household fixed-effects approach using Uganda National Panel Survey (UNPS) data
    from 2005-2011 combined with high-resolution precipitation and temperature data.
  5: The paper spatially links SPEI to household locations using GPS coordinates and
    temporally matches it based on the main growing season for each location, using
    the FAO crop calendar for Uganda. The authors use a regression equation (1) to
    estimate the effects of drought on households' willingness to purchase land.
  6: Household fixed effects regressions with controls for household characteristics,
    wave fixed effects, and interview month fixed effects. The model analyzes the
    effect of the SPEI in the growing season preceding the interview and its first
    and second lag on land acquisition decisions. Attrition weights are applied in
    all regressions. A Hausman test was conducted to determine the suitability of
    the fixed effects model.
  10: The analysis uses a household fixed effects model and exploits variation in
    drought intensity across time and space, combined with high-resolution weather
    data to calculate the SPEI drought index.
  12: Consultation of various information sources, using both simple and complex approaches
    to define growing seasons in Uganda, with data from Ugandan Ministry, FEWS Net,
    USDA, and other articles.
  14: Estimated with OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression, clustered standard errors
    at the district level, household fixed effects, wave fixed effects, month fixed
    effects, attrition weights applied; Data from UNPS (waves 2005/06, 2009/10, and
    2010/11), CHIRPS for precipitation, and CHIRTS for temperature
  16: OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regressions, Probit models with bias correction
    for fixed effects, and Poisson quasi-maximum likelihood models are used. The analysis
    uses data from UNPS (waves 2005/06, 2009/10, and 2010/11), CHIRPS for precipitation,
    and CHIRTS for temperature. Standard errors are clustered at the district level.
    Attrition weights applied.
  18: OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regressions with household, wave, and month fixed
    effects. Standard errors are clustered at the district level. Data from UNPS (waves
    2005/06, 2009/10, and 2010/11), CHIRPS for precipitation, and CHIRTS for temperature
    are used. Attrition weights are applied. SPEI is measured as a 5-year and 3-year
    average.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on Uganda, where many households hold use rights to land and
    face the decision of whether to acquire full ownership rights to this land.
  5: The analysis focuses on a sub-sample of households in Uganda that hold use rights
    to land. The temporal variation in SPEI is captured using current, first lag,
    and second lag values.
  6: The paper also considers the influence of remittances on land acquisition decisions,
    and controls for land characteristics, consumption expenditures, livestock holdings
    and an asset index, although endogeneity issues are acknowledged with respect
    to the controls. CHIRPS data is used for precipitation, and CHIRTS data is used
    for temperature to calculate SPEI.
  14: The analysis considers heterogeneous effects based on poverty status, gender
    of household head, and farm size. The dependent variable is 'Willingness to acquire
    land ownership rights'.
  16: The study performs robustness checks including inclusion of third lag of SPEI
    and lead SPEI, exclusion of Mailo land, and using Probit and Poisson models. Household,
    wave, and month fixed effects are included in the regressions.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Households' willingness to acquire land ownership rights (extensive margin),
    the price households are willing to pay for land (intensive margin).
  2: Households' intentions to purchase land (extensive and intensive margins).
  5: None
  6: Agricultural production
  14: No relevant information
  16: Willingness to purchase land; Amount households are willing to pay
  18: Willingness to purchase land and Amount households are willing to pay for purchasing
    land.
Quantitative material:
