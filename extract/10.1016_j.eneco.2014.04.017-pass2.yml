Drivers of Risk:
  6: "Changes in the probability distribution of experiencing different temperatures,\
    \ shifting from F0(t) to F\u03C4(t) due to climate change."
  7: Climate change leading to temperature variations.
  8: Global warming, warmer summers, warmer winters
  9: Temperature, heating degree days (HDD), cooling degree days (CDD)
  14: Changes in climate (implicitly through air conditioner adoption), population
    movements, income, prices of air conditioners and electricity, policy (e.g., Federal
    Housing Authority policy on mortgages)
  17: Air conditioner prices and efficiencies, income, cooling degree days, electricity
    price, purchase price of air conditioning units, energy efficiency standards for
    AC equipment
  19: Climate change (warming), rising incomes, air conditioner penetration
  20: Cooling degree days (CDD), income levels.
Highlights:
  6: The paper suggests that changes in energy expenditures, especially those derived
    from panel data, can be used to estimate the welfare effects of climate change.
    This is done through the estimation of Equations (3), (4) and (5).
  7: Cross-sectional data allows for the analysis of both extensive and intensive
    margins of consumption choices related to climate, assuming households are in
    long-run equilibrium.
  8: 'Global warming will result in fuel switching in the United States: more homes
    will heat with electricity; Overall, American energy expenditures will likely
    increase.'
  9: Cross-sectional approach may have omitted variable bias. Decrease in heating
    needs (due to warmer temperatures) will more than offset increases in cooling
    (Considine, 2000).
  14: The literature examining the adoption of air conditioners in response to changes
    in climate is essentially non-existent. There is a need for panel data methods
    in this literature.
  17: Significant responsiveness in the adoption of room and central air conditioners
    with respect to efficiency; Time series show little slowdown in the growth of
    air conditioner penetration.
  19: "Further studies of changing air conditioner penetration and collection of data\
    \ could provide important insights into the future of European energy demand.\
    \ A concerted e\uFB00ort to collect and analyze data for Europe similar to what\
    \ Rapson (2011) or Biddle (2008) did for the US would be insightful."
  20: Air conditioner penetration rates are very low and clustered around zero for
    a number of countries. Adoption rates increase significantly at income levels
    of $25,000.
Methodology:
  6: The paper proposes using changes in energy and durable goods expenditures to
    measure the welfare effects of climate change. It also suggests using panel data
    estimates to control for unobserved shocks correlated with temperature.
  7: "Uses cross-sectional data to compare consumption choices (including durables)\
    \ across different climates. The formula \u2206Wcross= \u20D7P\u2032E\xB7(\u20D7\
    E\u2217(F\u03C4)\u2212\u20D7E\u2217(F0)) measures the extensive and intensive\
    \ margins of welfare changes."
  8: Discrete-continuous choice model where fuel choice is endogenous to climate change;
    multinomial logit model is estimated; conditional demand equation used.
  9: Cross-sectional regression, time-series regression
  14: Review of literature on air conditioner adoption and durable goods adoption.
    Empirical models are often based on cross-sectional or repeated cross-sectional
    data due to data availability.
  17: Uses Residential Electricity Consumer Survey (RECS) data, matches it to air
    conditioner prices and efficiencies, estimates derived demand elasticities and
    unit demand elasticities.
  19: Discussion of data collection and analysis needs to understand drivers of energy
    demand.
  20: Cross-sectional regression using data on air conditioner penetration levels
    across countries (primarily from the LSMS database of the World Bank). The model
    estimates a 'Climate Maximum' (saturation level) based on cooling degree days
    in US cities and then uses this to predict saturation levels in developing countries,
    modeling diffusion as a function of income conditional on the Climate Maximum.
    Based on 24 observations.
More Notes:
  6: The analysis focuses on the impact of temperature changes on household energy
    and durable goods expenditures, excluding direct impacts on utility and potential
    relocation effects. The paper assumes that a household derives utility in part
    by controlling interior temperature.
  7: The approach does not account for the cost of changing durables or transition
    costs and may be subject to omitted variable bias. The authors organize their
    literature review by data type (cross-section, time series, panel) because data
    variation informs about the intensive and extensive margins.
  8: The analysis uses 30-year average monthly temperature and precipitation data
    matched to household and firm Energy Information Administration survey data.
  14: The paper suggests that air conditioner adoption can be seen as a proxy for
    climate adaptation, highlighting the importance of considering factors beyond
    climate change itself, such as income, prices, and policy.
  17: The paper by Rapson (2011) is a structural paper that exploits the time dimension
    of the repeated cross sections to arrive at credible and precisely estimated coefficients
    for both intensive and extensive margin adjustments.
  19: The paper suggests that increased air conditioner use due to climate change
    could significantly impact electricity consumption and load profiles, especially
    given shifts away from nuclear power.

    to climate change, rather than national-level macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes
    or the costs/benefits of adaptation. It does not provide quantitative results
    or specific methodologies applicable to the overall review.

    change, and changes in energy expenditure related to temperature fluctuations.
  8: Warmer summers result in more electricity and oil consumption, while warmer winters
    will result in less natural gas consumption for households.

    with respect to cooling degree days (CDD) for nearly all sectors and fuels.
