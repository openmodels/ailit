Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (CO2 and methane emissions), arable land per hectare.
  2: Climate change, specifically variations in rainfall, drought, flooding, and warmer/cooler
    temperatures, impacts food systems. GHG emissions lead to increased average global
    temperature and depletion of water resources, threatening global food security.
  4: Climate change; Technological inefficiency
  5: Random shocks such as unfavorable weather, measurement errors, and variable omissions
    impact cereal crop yields and contribute to inefficiencies.
  6: Climate change (specifically CO2 and methane emissions).
  7: Low and unpredictable growth rates in cereal production due to rain-fed agriculture
    and subsistence orientation are identified as drivers of risk in Sub-Saharan Africa.
  8: Insufficient investment in farm-level research, harsh geographical conditions,
    disputes, a failure to absorb production and marketing risks, ineffective incentives,
    climatic change, high carbon emissions.
  10: The lack of innovation and slow adoption of technology in agriculture and excessive
    heat affecting agricultural input productivity are stated as risks.
  12: Agricultural methane, CO2 emissions, climate change (leading to flooding, soil
    erosion, acid rain, drought, ozone formation).
  13: Flooding, corrosive rain, and severe weather impact input productivity during
    harvest.
  14: Shocks impacting outcomes include climate change effects such as acidic rainfall,
    flooding, and land erosion, adversely affecting land, labor, and fertilizer productivity.
  15: Climate change, CO2 emissions, agricultural methane emissions.
Highlights:
  1: The region has a high level of technical efficiency in cereal crop production,
    but climate change is reducing land, labor, and fertilizer productivity.
  2: Climate change will negate agricultural productivity gains in Africa by 2050,
    impacting GDP.
  4: Climate change impacts agricultural productivity and technical efficiency.
  6: Climate change (CO2 and methane emissions) impacts agriculture factor productivity
    and cereal yield. Total factor productivity is an important measure.
  7: The study concludes that integrating agriculture with high technological adoption
    can significantly increase productivity and reduce malnutrition in Sub-Saharan
    Africa.
  8: Cereal crop yields and climate change show a consistent and similar pattern in
    the majority of the region from 2005 to 2020.
  10: Fertilizer adoption contributed most to the growth of cereal crop yields in
    Sub-Saharan African countries during the study period.
  12: Agricultural methane and CO2 emissions have a negative impact on land productivity,
    while GDP per capita income has a positive impact. Climate change has an adverse
    impact on fertilizer productivity. Climate change decreases labor productivity.
  13: The elasticity of arable land, labor supply, and fertilizer adoption was significant
    in the analysis.
  14: The region experienced an average technical efficiency of 83%, with a maximum
    of 99.4% and a minimum of 68.3%. Fertilizer consumption has notable contributions
    to technical efficiency despite climate change's adverse effects on productivity
    inputs.
  15: Climate change negatively impacts agricultural input productivity, and governments
    should give high attention to mitigating the impact of climate change on input
    productivity.
Methodology:
  1: Panel data from 35 sub-Saharan African countries between 2005 and 2020 was employed.
    The pooled OLS and stochastic frontier models were employed for analysis.
  4: Panel data estimation technique and stochastic frontier analysis; Data obtained
    from the World Bank data base; Focused on the production of wheat, rice, maize,
    barley, oats, rye, millet, sorghum, and buckwheat.
  5: The paper employs a stochastic frontier production model to assess technical
    efficiency and investigate the impact of climate change on productivity. It uses
    the Cobb-Douglas production function for this analysis.
  6: Pooled OLS panel model used to examine the impacts of climate change on agriculture
    factor productivity. This model is most applicable in the absence of individual
    heterogeneity and heteroscedasticity, which the authors verify is the case in
    their data through the LM test of heterogeneity. Cobb-Douglas production function
    is used to derive total factor productivity.
  7: The analysis is based on estimating technical efficiency using homogeneous technology
    assumptions, focusing on cereal crops in Sub-Saharan Africa from 2005 to 2020.
  8: Analysis using data from sub-Saharan African countries to show the link between
    climate change and cereal crop yields. The source mentions own computation STATA
    17, suggesting econometric analysis.
  10: The analysis uses technical efficiency scores computed using STATA 17, focusing
    on agriculture in Sub-Saharan African countries from 2005 to 2020.
  12: Regression models (Model 1, Model 2, Model 3) used to estimate the impact of
    climate change on agricultural input productivity.
  13: Stochastic frontier analysis is used to analyze the technical efficiency of
    cereal crop production.
  14: The analysis uses pooled OLS and stochastic frontier models with panel data
    sets from 2005 to 2020 focused on Sub-Saharan African countries.
  15: Estimating the technical efficiency of cereal crop yields.
More Notes:
  1: The study suggests combining skilled labour and fertilizer with sophisticated
    agriculture technologies and climate-resistant varieties to increase cereal crop
    yield efficiency and limit the adverse effects of climate change.
  6: The technical efficiency/inefficiency of countries is modeled as a function of
    economic factors (Eq. 5). The paper examines the impact of climate change on agricultural
    factor productivity, encompassing land, labor, and fertilizer. The pooled OLS
    model effectively treats the panel data as cross-sectional data. The parameters
    in the model are to be estimated.  No specific data or results of the estimation
    are provided on this page.
  8: The study mentions that with the expansion of technology, CO2 increases world
    yields by roughly 1.8% every decade while decreasing them by 1.5% every decade
    [9].
  12: The analysis controls for GDP per capita income when estimating the impact on
    land productivity. Diagnostic tests confirmed no serial correlation and non-constant
    variance in the regression models. The study suggests that climate change has
    global socioeconomic impacts but its impact is very significant in high-temperature
    zones.
  15: The study suggests future research should include the effects of technical efficiency
    and climate change on food insecurity in the region. The study does not include
    all sub-Saharan African countries and other variables like improved seed and mechanical
    technology due to absence of data.

    for cereal crop yields, which can relate to broader productivity measures.
  12: Impact of climate change on agricultural input productivity (land, labor, and
    fertilizer productivity).
  13: Total factor productivity, boosted by GDP per capita growth, enhances agriculture
    factor productivity by enabling expansion and adoption of new farming methods,
    technology, and infrastructure.
  14: Climate change is harming agriculture and driving crop production inefficiencies
    in Africa, impacting the macroeconomic outcomes like food security and agricultural
    productivity.
  15: Agricultural methane emissions reduce labour, land, and fertilizer productivity,
    but GDP per capita income increases factor productivity.
Quantitative material:
  1: Average efficiency score for producing cereal crops between 2005 and 2020 was
    83%. Labour contributed 51.5% and fertilizer contributed 5.7% to raising the technical
    efficiency of cereal crop yields, whereas arable land per hectare reduced the
    technical efficiency of cereal yields by 44.7%. Climate change diminishes land,
    labour, and fertilizers productivity at a 1% significance level, whereas GDP per
    capita boosts significantly the total factor productivity in agriculture.
  2: Without technology, crop yields decrease by 1.5% every decade.
  4: Africa is predicted to miss out on around 62% of its agricultural potential due
    to a technological efficiency of 38.2%; Ethiopia has an estimated technical efficiency
    of 66%.
  6: Equations (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12) describe the relationships between variables,
    but no specific quantitative results are provided on this page.
  7: Technical efficiency of cereal production in Africa is reported as 38.2%, with
    a minimum score of 60% efficiency for yields of 1100 kg/ha and up to 90% for yields
    of 1600 kg/ha.
  8: Cereal crop yields remained steady between 2005 and 2020 in the region studied.
  10: Table 2 provides descriptive statistics on efficiency scores, cereal yields
    per hectare, and productivity of land, labor, and fertilizer.
  12: A one percent release of agricultural methane reduces average land productivity
    by 5.80 kg for grain yields. A one percent release of CO2 emission reduces average
    land productivity by 5.13 kg for grain yields. GDP per capita income has positive
    and statistically significant impact on land, labor, and fertilizer productivity.
  13: A one-unit increase in GDP per capita income leads to a noted one-unit increase
    in total factor productivity of land, labor, and fertilizer.
  14: The elasticity of land size has a negative impact on cereal crop efficiency
    in kilograms per hectare, reducing efficiency by 0.447% per hectare. A 1% increase
    in agricultural labor and fertilizer consumption per hectare contributes to a
    0.515% and 0.057% rise in cereal crop production efficiency, respectively.
