Drivers of Risk:

  10: Methane emissions from sources in California and Turkmenistan
  11: Human and natural drivers impacting carbon stored in the above-ground land biosphere,
    emission hotspots.
  16: Changes in forest disturbance regimes, permafrost, wetland area, and ecological
    variables can impact GHG absorption capacities.
Highlights:
  2: No relevant information
  3: Climate services mainly focus on delivering better data and improving products
    rather than engaging with end-users to deliver demand-driven services that lead
    to transformational change for climate adaptation.
  10: Satellite observations can identify hotspots of methane emissions that can inform
    targeted mitigation strategies by local policy-makers and stakeholders.
  11: "Systematic use of remotely sensed carbon dynamics could support veri\uFB01\
    cation of the ef\uFB01cacy of REDD and carbon offsetting schemes."
  16: The development of observation-based indicators for adaptation-related geophysical
    variables is essential for adaptation efforts.
Methodology:
  2: No relevant information
  3: The analysis brings together EO researchers, climate scientists, policymakers,
    and representatives from national agencies and the private sector to develop a
    holistic view of exploiting EO for the Paris Agreement.
  10: Uses satellite observations (SCIAMACHY and Sentinel-5P) to retrieve column-averaged
    atmospheric methane (XCH4). The data is processed and visualized to identify hotspots
    of methane emissions. Results are applicable for 2004 (SCIAMACHY data) and 2018
    (Sentinel-5P data) in California and Turkmenistan.
  11: Uses remotely sensed carbon dynamics (Vegetation Optical Depth in the L-band
    (L-VOD) from SMOS passive microwave observations) to monitor and attribute gross
    changes in carbon stored in the above-ground land biosphere.
  16: Modeling systems with and without adaptation measures to quantify differences
    and explore uncertainties; uses Earth system modeling.

  10: The page focuses on identifying methane emission sources and does not directly
    address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes or the costs/benefits of adaptation.
    The mention of 'local policy-makers and stakeholders' suggests a link to potential
    mitigation strategies, which could indirectly impact economic outcomes, but this
    link is not quantified or explored in this excerpt.
  11: "Bottom-up and top-down estimates of emissions can exhibit signi\uFB01cant differences\
    \ and require further efforts to be reconciled."
  16: The paper emphasizes the need for co-developing adaptation indicators relevant
    for key sectors, acknowledging the complexity and lack of clear global targets
    for adaptation.
