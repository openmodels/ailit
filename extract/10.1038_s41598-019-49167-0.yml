Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts, specifically increased temperature and frequent heat
    and rainfall extremes in West Africa, affecting crop yields.
  5: Historical climate change, specifically changes in daily mean, maximum and minimum
    2-m air temperatures, precipitation, downward shortwave radiation flux, relative
    humidity and 10-m wind speed.
  6: Historical human activities impacting regional climate and surface temperature
    changes in West Africa.
  7: Historical climate change (changes in temperature, rainfall, number of very hot
    days, etc.)
  8: Temperature change due to historical climate change is causing yield loss in
    millet and sorghum in West Africa.
  9: Temperature increase, rainfall variations (both decreases and increases), increased
    heat stress, water stress (likely through increased evapotranspiration), shortened
    crop duration with increased temperatures.
  10: Increase in mean temperature in the Sahel and Sahara due to human activities;
    Increase in the intensity of rainy events in West Africa attributed to global
    warming and warmer Sahara.
  11: Historical climate change relative to a non-warming counterfactual climate condition.
  12: Historical climate change, specifically warmer conditions and altered precipitation
    patterns, relative to a counterfactual climate condition excluding human influence.
  13: Climate change impacts leading to crop yield reductions, especially temperature
    increases in the Sahel region.
Highlights:
  1: Historical climate change in West Africa has already led to significant yield
    losses, impacting agricultural production and economic outcomes.
  5: The study aims to estimate production losses associated with historical climate
    change by comparing historical and non-warming counterfactual crop simulations.
  6: Human activities have led to a significant increase in regional temperatures
    and an increase in the number of very hot days in North West Africa.
  7: "The simulated impacts on average yields in 2000\u20132009 due to historical\
    \ climate change varied by location and between the two crop models. The CYGMA\
    \ model accurately reproduces yield trends, while the SARRA-H model better reproduces\
    \ year-to-year variability."
  8: Negative yield impacts are consistent in West Africa between both crop models,
    with the greatest losses in countries such as Niger, Senegal, and Mali.
  9: Warming leads to yield losses. Increased evapotranspiration-led water deficit
    is the largest contributing factor to yield loss. CO2 fertilization and technological
    improvement are insufficient to offset the increased heat and water stress.
  10: Human activities have already had a significant impact on the regional climate
    in the Sahel, with negative consequences on agricultural production.
  11: "Geographical patterns of average yield impacts in 2000\u20132009 associated\
    \ with historical climate change were simulated. Millet and sorghum production\
    \ are negatively impacted by climate change."
  12: Climate change has already led to substantial yield reductions in millet and
    sorghum in West Africa during 2000-2009.
  13: "Significant negative impact of climate change on crop yields in West Africa;\
    \ warming of 1 \xB0C can lead to yield losses."
Methodology:
  1: Used a large ensemble of historical climate simulations derived from an atmospheric
    general circulation model and two process-based crop models (SARRA-H and CYGMA)
    to assess effects on crop production.
  5: The study uses two crop models (CYGMA and SARRA-H) with factual and counterfactual
    climate simulations to estimate the impacts of historical climate change on crop
    yields. The factual simulations use climate data with human influence, while counterfactual
    simulations use data without human influence. The methodology is applied to West
    Africa, focusing on rainfed agriculture.
  6: Analysis based on climate simulations (factual and counterfactual) to assess
    the impact of human influence on West African climate.
  7: Comparison of simulations from two crop models (CYGMA and SARRA-H) against observed
    yield data to assess the impact of historical climate change on crop yields in
    West Africa; statistical significance assessed using Student's t-test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov
    test.
  8: "The analysis is based on simulated climate models (SARRA-H and CYGMA) compared\
    \ against reported data from M3Crops; results are averaged over the period 1997\u2013\
    2003 and account for historic climate impacts on yields."
  9: "Comparison of annual yield time series reported by FAO and average yields simulated\
    \ by SARRA-H and CYGMA models for millet and sorghum (1961\u20132012) in West\
    \ Africa; sensitivity analysis with the CYGMA model."
  10: Uses a large ensemble of climate simulations and two crop models (SARRA-H and
    CYGMA) to estimate the effects of historical climate change on crop production
    in West Africa.
  11: Crop simulations using Cygma and SARRA-H models, comparing factual and counterfactual
    climate conditions for 2000-2009. Ensemble members used to derive confidence intervals
    (25-75% and 5-95%). Regional average data for West Africa calculated by averaging
    data from Benin, Burkina Faso, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger,
    Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.
  12: Two independent crop models (SARRA-H and CYGMA) were used to assess crop production
    losses. SARRA-H excels at capturing yield anomalies driven by seasonal climate
    variability, while CYGMA considers technological improvements and agronomic adjustments.
  13: Crop models (CYGMA and SARRA-H) used to simulate yield impacts in different
    climate conditions; differences in model outputs attributed to temperature sensitivity.
More Notes:
  5: The CYGMA model incorporates socioeconomic data (GDP, agricultural area, knowledge
    stock) to parameterize fertilizer use and technological improvements. It accounts
    for irrigation based on historical data, but notes that West Africa has almost
    no irrigated areas.
  6: No relevant information
  7: FAO yield statistics in the region may be derived from data imputation or unofficial
    data sources, and historical management information is not available, which makes
    comparisons difficult.
  9: There are uncertainties in the climate-yield relationship across the two models
    SARRA-H and CYGMA.
  10: SARRA-H model overestimates the effect of climate on crop yield compared to
    CYGMA model or reported yields from FAO. CYGMA considers technological and CO2
    fertilization effects, which SARRA-H does not.
  11: The maps show variations in simulated crop yield impacts. Areas in white on
    Figure 5 indicate that the simulated yield change is non-significant at the 1%
    level.
  12: The SARRA-H model often simulates more severe yield impacts than the CYGMA model
    due to the explicit consideration of technological improvements and agronomic
    adjustments in the CYGMA model.
  13: Limitations include differences between modeled and reported data due to imperfect
    inputs and assumptions in crop yield models.
