Drivers of Risk:
  1: Annual temperature shocks
  2: Weather variability, climate change, hot temperatures.
  4: Temperature shocks are the driver of risk being studied.
  5: Climate change, specifically increases in global temperature, impacts TFP through
    a damage function.
  6: Climate change impacts partitioned between output and TFP
  7: Temperature and precipitation are identified as drivers of risk, impacting TFP.
  8: Annual temperature change and annual change in precipitation levels
  9: Annual changes in temperature, particularly in low-income countries
  10: Annual changes in temperature and precipitation
  11: Temperature shocks.
  12: Annual temperature change (temperature shocks) is the main driver of risk being
    examined. Average temperature and GDP per capita are explored as factors that
    mediate the impacts of temperature shocks.
  13: Annual change in temperature (Delta1Temp), Annual change in precipitation (Delta1Pre)
  14: Temperature shocks impacting the growth rate of total factor productivity (TFP).
  15: "Annual change in temperature (\u0394Temp) and annual change in precipitation\
    \ (\u0394Pre)"
  16: "Temperature changes (\u0394Temp) impact the Effects on Linear Prediction."
  17: Temperature shocks.
  19: "Future warming, with an average global temperature increase of 3.912 \xB0C\
    \ by the end of the century."
  20: Temperature shocks.
  21: Temperature shocks; poverty.
Highlights:
  1: A negative relationship between annual temperature shocks and TFP growth rates
    only exists in poor countries.
  2: "The average effect size of weather and climate on total factor productivity\
    \ growth is small. The distinction between static, or \u201Clevel\u201D effects,\
    \ and dynamic, or \u201Cgrowth\u201D effects of climate change on economic activity\
    \ is of \uFB01rst order importance in terms of the magnitude of future impacts.\
    \ Growth effects compound over time and permanently reduce output."
  4: The paper provides a useful empirical test for the plausibility of the recent
    hypothesis of an impact of climate change on TFP growth. This is the first study
    to examine the macro relationship between temperature shocks and TFP growth.
  5: Climate change can affect long-run economic growth by reducing current output,
    savings, and investment.
  7: A negative correlation is observed between TFP levels and average temperatures
    in 2006. High variability in annual TFP growth rates, temperature changes, and
    precipitation is described.
  8: Weather shocks impact the growth rate of total factor productivity.
  9: Temperature variations affect TFP growth, with negative effects concentrated
    in poor countries.  The effect is weakened when controlling for 'hot' climates,
    potentially due to the overlap between 'hot' and 'poor' classifications.
  10: Temperature shocks negatively affect TFP growth rates in poor countries. Precipitation
    also negatively affects TFP growth.
  11: Temperature shocks have a negative impact on TFP growth rate, particularly in
    poor countries, but some evidence suggests a negative impact in hot countries
    as well. The heterogeneity of impacts between rich and poor countries is a key
    finding.
  12: The impact of hot weather is positive in cool countries and negative in warm
    countries. The temperature response is driven by average income, rather than by
    average temperature. There is no evidence of meaningful non-linear effects of
    temperature shocks, and that a linear function is the best approximation of the
    TFP-temperature relationship. Countries at different levels of development respond
    differently to weather shocks.
  13: Temperature and precipitation changes can negatively impact TFP growth. The
    impacts of temperature change may be non-linear. The effect of temperature change
    on TFP growth varies depending on whether the country is poor or hot. The effect
    of precipitation change on TFP growth is consistently negative and often statistically
    significant.
  14: The study finds that the negative impact of temperature shocks on TFP growth
    diminishes and may disappear as countries grow richer, contingent on average GDP
    per capita levels.
  15: The relationship between temperature change and TFP growth is moderated by institutional
    quality (Polity 2) and GDP per capita.
  16: As GDP per capita increases, the average marginal effects of temperature changes
    on the linear prediction increase (Figure 3). As GDP per capita increases, the
    effect of temperature on the variable becomes less negative and approaches zero
    (Figure 4).
  17: Temperature shocks negatively impact TFP growth and labor productivity growth
    only in poor countries, suggesting that development gaps and the composition of
    TFP (e.g. high reliance on agriculture) make poor countries more vulnerable.
  18: Increased temperature and precipitation is negatively correlated with annual
    labour productivity growth. The negative impact of temperature increases is more
    pronounced in poorer countries.
  19: Poor countries face significantly higher risks with both greater TFP impact
    and persistent dynamic effects from temperature shocks.
  20: Climate change harms TFP growth in poor countries, with evidence of persistence
    of impacts over time.
  21: TFP growth rates of poor countries are affected by temperature shocks. Weather
    shocks affect economic growth through the TFP channel only when coupled with poverty.
Methodology:
  1: "Examining the relationship between annual temperature shocks and TFP growth\
    \ rates in the period 1960\u20132006, using macro TFP data from the Penn World\
    \ Table."
  2: Econometric evidence is presented on the impact of weather and climate on total
    factor productivity growth.
  4: "The paper uses a panel dataset for 60 countries, covering the period 1960\u2013\
    2006, to test the hypothesis of a causal relationship between temperature shocks\
    \ and annual TFP growth rates."
  5: "The analysis uses a standard DICE (Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy) model,\
    \ which is a Ramsey\u2013Cass\u2013Koopmans growth model with added climate externality\
    \ and emission abatement costs."
  6: The paper analyzes the effects of climate change impacts on TFP using RTFPNA
    data and calculates annual RTFPNA growth rates by first-differencing and checking
    for stationarity. They also use growth rates of real GDP, capital stock, and labour
    force from national accounts data.
  7: The analysis uses panel data from 60 countries from 1960-2006. Temperature and
    precipitation data are first-differenced to ensure stationarity in regressions.
    Population weights are used to aggregate temperature and precipitation data.
  8: Fixed-effect panel data analysis is used to isolate the impact of weather shocks
    on TFP growth rate. Includes country fixed effects, and region x time fixed effects.
    Error terms are adjusted for clustering at the country level.
  9: Panel data regression analysis of the impact of temperature and precipitation
    changes on TFP growth rates, controlling for poverty (GDP per capita below median
    in 1960) and hot climate (above median average temperature in the 1960s). The
    results apply to national-level, annual data.
  10: Panel regression analysis with country fixed effects and region-time fixed effects,
    using data from 1960-2006. Different specifications include interaction terms
    for 'poor' and 'hot' countries, based on GDP per capita and average temperature
    in the 1960s.
  11: Regression analysis with different specifications, datasets (68 countries, 1970-2006),
    and robustness checks (interactions with rich/poor dummies, climatic data, functional
    forms of weather variables, Driscoll and Kraay standard errors, lags in regressions,
    etc.).
  12: The paper uses panel regressions to estimate the impact of temperature shocks
    and their interactions with average temperature and GDP per capita on TFP growth.
    Different model specifications are used to test for non-linear effects and the
    role of income. The results of the analysis are relevant for understanding the
    contemporaneous impact of temperature shocks on TFP growth at the national level.
  13: Panel regression with country fixed effects and region x time fixed effects.
    Standard errors are clustered at the country level.
  14: Analysis includes interaction of average GDP per capita with temperature changes,
    using country and region fixed effects. The significance of coefficients is checked
    at different GDP per capita levels.
  15: Panel regression with country fixed effects and region x time fixed effects.
    Standard errors are clustered at the country level.
  16: Panel data analysis is used, incorporating Polity2 as a measure of institutions,
    with interaction terms for temperature changes and 'poor' institutional quality.
    The relationship between climate, institutions and development is tested, where
    Polity2 ranges from -10 to 10.
  17: Panel regression analysis, using annual TFP growth and annual labor productivity
    growth as dependent variables, with data from Penn World Table (PWT 8.1). Applicable
    to analysis of impact of temperature shocks on economic activity, especially for
    poor countries.
  18: Panel regression analysis with country fixed effects and Region x Time fixed
    effects, examining the impact of temperature and precipitation changes on annual
    labour productivity growth. Standard errors are clustered at the country level.
    The model is estimated on a dataset with N=2760.
  19: The projections use benchmark estimates to predict TFP growth impact due to
    future warming, focusing on short-run semi-elasticity rather than long-run effects.
  20: Analyzes the past relationship between TFP growth rates and temperature shocks
    using first differences to address non-stationarity. Robust to alternative samples,
    data, and specifications.
  21: The analysis is based on historical data and estimates the short-run semi-elasticity
    of TFP with respect to weather variations. It looks at the relationship between
    temperature, poverty, and productivity growth.
More Notes:
  1: The study extrapolates from weather to climate and suggests dynamic effects of
    climate change in poor countries, reinforcing the need for climate policy and
    poverty reduction to be complementary.
  5: The paper investigates the impact of weather and climate on TFP growth, focusing
    on the persistence of weather impacts on economic activity in the medium or long
    run. It also highlights the importance of labor productivity in poor countries
    as a driver of TFP impact.
  6: The paper uses a country-specific index of TFP (RTFPNA). The paper acknowledges
    potential measurement errors in TFP data. The definition of TFP growth rate refers
    to annual growth rate of the natural logarithm of the RTFPNA index from PWT 8.1.
  7: The choice of countries is based on data availability. The observed correlation
    between TFP and temperature may be influenced by confounding factors like institutions,
    and is not necessarily causal.
  8: The paper addresses potential omitted variable bias by including precipitation
    and discusses the issue of over-controlling with endogenous variables.
  9: TFP is a mix of many factors and the channel through which temperature affects
    TFP is not precisely identified. Precipitation change has a negative and significant
    effect, but this variable has proved to be very sensitive to specifications.
  10: The effect of temperature changes on TFP growth appears to be concentrated in
    poor countries. The definition of 'poor' varies slightly between models.  The
    paper uses clustered standard errors at the country level.
  13: Poor is defined as below median GDP per capita in 1960. Hot is defined as above
    median average temperature in the 1960s. The squared term for temperature change
    is included to check for non-linearity. The total effect in poor and hot countries
    is calculated by summing the coefficients on temperature change and the interaction
    term.
  15: Poor is defined as countries with below median GDP per capita in 1960. Hot is
    defined as countries with above median average temperature in the 1960s.
  16: The paper investigates whether the impact of temperature appears through the
    institutional channel by interacting it with annual temperature changes.
  17: The study suggests labor productivity is a key channel for the temperature-TFP
    relationship in poor countries.
  19: Negative impacts on TFP growth disappear once a certain per capita income threshold
    ($34,400 for hot countries) is reached.
  20: Sample size is limited (less than 70 countries), and TFP data is the Solow residual,
    which is subject to measurement error. Weather data also suffers from measurement
    error.
  21: The study acknowledges several limitations, including the potential for non-linear
    effects of climate change, the assumption that historical relationships will continue
    to hold, and the difficulty of accounting for adaptation measures and defensive
    investment. Estimates of TFP may be biased by adaptation to climate change.

Quantitative material:
  1: "A 1 \xB0C annual increase in temperature decreases TFP growth rates by about\
    \ 1.1\u20131.8 percentage points in poor countries."
  4: The paper finds that temperature shocks affect annual TFP growth rates only in
    poor countries.
  5: "Equation (1) represents the impact function for output, relating output to climate\
    \ change via the term \u03A9(Yt). Equation (3) specifies \u03A9(Yt) as a quadratic\
    \ function of the change in global temperature. Equation (4) specifies how climate\
    \ change impacts TFP."
  6: The paper uses RTFPNA data from Penn World Table 8.1 to measure TFP. It also
    uses the natural logarithm of the RTFPNA index. The benchmark value is 0 for all
    countries in the logarithmic specification in 2005
  7: Descriptive statistics are provided for annual growth rates of TFP, temperature
    changes, and precipitation variability, covering 60 countries over 1960-2006.
    Figure 1 presents a scatterplot visualizing the correlation between TFP and temperature
    levels in 2006.
  8: Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for TFP growth rate, temperature change,
    precipitation change, and GDP per capita, including mean, variance, standard deviation,
    minimum, maximum, and number of observations.
  9: "A 1\xB0C annual increase in temperature would lower TFP growth rates of countries\
    \ by 0.49% (Column 1). A 1\xB0C annual increase in temperature in poor countries\
    \ would decrease TFP growth rates by about 1.5 percentage points (Column 2)."
  10: A 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature is associated with a statistically
    significant decrease in TFP growth for poor countries, ranging from -1.139 to
    -1.523 percentage points, depending on the model specification.  A 100 mm increase
    in annual precipitation is associated with a decrease in TFP growth.
  11: Negative impact of temperature shocks in hot countries, with a net effect of
    about -1 percentage point on the annual TFP growth.
  12: The paper uses regression analysis with interaction terms to quantify the impact
    of temperature changes on TFP growth, and how this impact is modified by average
    temperature and GDP per capita.
  13: The table provides coefficients, standard errors, and significance levels for
    regressions where annual TFP growth rate is the dependent variable and changes
    in temperature and precipitation, as well as interactions with income (Poor) and
    temperature (Hot) dummies, are the independent variables. For example, a 1 degree
    Celsius increase in temperature is associated with a -0.490 percentage point change
    in TFP growth (significant at the 5% level in column 1). A 100 mm increase in
    precipitation is associated with a negative change in TFP growth (-0.033 to -0.051,
    significant at least at the 10% level in some specifications).
  14: "The marginal effect of a 1 \xB0C annual increase on TFP growth becomes zero\
    \ at certain income levels: $34,400 per person for 'hot' countries, $14,900 for\
    \ non-hot countries, and $25,600 for the sample as a whole."
  15: The total effect of temperature change in poor countries is -1.342 (significant
    at the 1% level).
  16: The figures show average marginal effects of temperature changes on a linear
    prediction at different GDP per capita levels, along with 95% confidence intervals.
  17: "Negative shocks to TFP growth rate in poor countries were 0.018% (SE 0.005%)\
    \ per year larger than positive shocks due to a 0.012 \xB0C larger positive temperature\
    \ shock."
  19: Predicted decrease in TFP growth of 5.96% in poor countries and 0.11% in rich
    countries by 2095.
  20: Upper bound estimate suggests that climate change would reduce TFP growth by
    less than 0.1%.
