Drivers of Risk:
  1: Natural hazards related to climate change, specifically wind storms, extreme
    waves, high and low sea levels, ice ridging, heavy precipitation, sea-effect snowfall,
    river floods, heat waves, ice seasons, drought, phytoplankton blooms, forest fires,
    coastal flooding, offshore infrastructure issues, and shipping disruptions.
  13: Increasing intensity of precipitation events resulting from the larger water-holding
    capacity of a warmer atmosphere is an expected impact of climate change.
  17: Changes in warm spell duration index (WSDI) and cold spell duration index (CSDI);
    Increasing streamflow in winter months; Decreasing spring streamflow in east Baltic
    states; Decrease in annual maximum discharge for major rivers (Western Dvina,
    Lielupe, Venta, Gauja, and Salaca); Shift in flood time occurrence from late March
    to February due to earlier snowmelt.
  20: Cold and calm weather, followed by a cyclone with strong south-westerly winds,
    leading to ice compression and ridging.
  21: Excessive phytoplankton blooms caused by anthropogenic eutrophication
  26: Flood height increases exponentially influence the damage costs in European
    cities.
  29: Extreme events (storms, convective weather, meteo-tsunamis) and their changes
    due to climate change, as well as cryosphere changes.
  32: Changes in the frequency and intensity of natural hazards and extreme events
    in the Baltic Sea region due to climate change, including extratropical cyclones,
    extreme ocean waves, extreme sea levels, ice ridging, intense precipitation, sea-effect
    snowfall, heat waves, cold spells, marine heat waves, phytoplankton blooms, extreme
    ice winters, severe ice winters, and drying.
  33: Sea level, wind, wave, and precipitation features are drivers of coastal flooding
    risk. Drought and heat waves can increase forest fire risk, though increased precipitation
    might decrease the risk in some areas. Extreme wind and wave conditions impact
    the offshore wind energy sector. Wind and wave conditions, icing due to sea spray,
    and ice conditions affect shipping in the Baltic Sea.
Highlights:
  1: Changes are expected for sea level, extreme precipitation, heat waves and phytoplankton
    blooms (increase), and cold spells and severe ice winters (decrease). For some
    extremes (drying, river flooding, and extreme waves), the change depends on the
    area and time period studied.
  13: No relevant information
  17: Number of severe floods increased significantly since the 1980s in the Neman
    River delta; Lifetime of individual floods has become shorter in the Neman River
    delta.
  20: Severe ice compression events can cause total stoppage of marine traffic and
    damage to ships. Severe ice winters, like those of 2010 and 2011, can lead to
    a significant increase in ship accidents.
  26: Copenhagen shows the highest potential increase in damage costs with flood height,
    and Denmark has the highest projected flood damage costs for 2050 and 2100 among
    the listed countries.
  29: Uncertainty in local responses to large-scale variability and global change
    is a key issue, especially soil water response to heat waves and changes in the
    frequency of major Baltic inflows. Impact of extreme cryosphere changes on forestry,
    reindeer herding, spring floods, extreme wave heights, and shipping is largely
    unknown. Low-flow periods are less well described in flood assessments.
  32: The frequency and intensity of various natural hazards and extreme events in
    the Baltic Sea region are projected to change significantly under future climate
    scenarios, with potential impacts on coastal infrastructure and shipping (ice
    ridging) and other biological events (phytoplankton blooms).
  33: Coastal flooding damage in Baltic coastal cities is expected to increase significantly.
    Wave climate in the eastern part of Bothnian Bay and Gulf of Finland is projected
    to get more severe as ice winters shorten.
Methodology:
  13: No relevant information
  17: Time series analysis of WSDI and CSDI from 1950-2018; spatial distribution of
    30-year means of WSDI and CSDI during 1989-2018 (baseline 1961-1990); analysis
    of streamflow trends and flood frequency; Data based on wsdiETCCDI and csdiETCCDI
    data.
  26: The analysis uses estimated damage cost curves for coastal flood events and
    expected annual damage to assess impacts, with data visualized in graphs and tables
    showing estimates for specific years (2050 and 2100).
  29: Analysis of long time series data and/or large-ensemble model simulations with
    high spatial coverage; use of convection-permitting climate models with grid spacing
    of a few kilometers; use of weather radars, satellites, and lightning-location
    sensors.
  32: The analysis uses climate models to project future scenarios of natural hazards
    and extreme events based on past decades' trends, focusing on the Baltic Sea region.
    The applicability is for future climate conditions.
  33: The paper summarizes changes in extreme events over past decades and, using
    scenarios, for the upcoming decades. It combines information on various extremes
    and their changes to assess development and potential future damage.

    circulation to climate change, marine heat waves, and small-scale variability
    in precipitation.
  13: This page focuses on precipitation patterns and climate model performance in
    the Baltic Sea region, primarily discussing the challenges of accurately representing
    precipitation extremes with climate models. It does not directly address macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal outcomes or the costs/benefits of adaptation.
  17: The study focuses on the Baltic Sea region.
  32: The paper emphasizes the need for more research to understand specific events
    like sea-effect snowfall and the uncertainties related to large-scale circulation
    changes affecting severe ice winters.
