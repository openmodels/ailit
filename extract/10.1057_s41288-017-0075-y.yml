Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate-related events (windstorm, flood, drought, hail, brushfire) and other
    natural catastrophes (earthquake, tsunami).
  7: Natural catastrophes (quake, wind, flood), lack of insurance penetration, corruption,
    political risk, Islamic law (as it relates to insurance), disaster losses, lack
    of access to technology (internet/mobile), savings rates.
  10: Windstorm, earthquake, and flood geophysical scenarios.
  12: Natural catastrophes (quake, wind, flood) are the main drivers of risk, leading
    to property damage and economic losses.
  13: The page discusses natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, wind, and flood
    events contributing to insured and uninsured losses by country.
  14: Natural catastrophes (quake, wind, flood) leading to property damage losses;
    Weather-related events; Economic factors like consumption per capita, GDP growth,
    and savings rates.
  15: Natural catastrophe (cat) exposures, availability bias (focus on recent disaster
    experience), financial market access, product diversity in insurance, and mobile
    phone access are identified as drivers of risk influencing insurance penetration.
  19: Climate-related events such as earthquakes, windstorms, and floods impacting
    property damages.
  20: Natural disasters, extreme weather events, and climate change can burden government
    budgets.
  22: Natural catastrophes (quake, wind, flood), weather-related events.
  26: Expected property damage losses due to natural catastrophes, including earthquakes,
    wind, and floods, are indicated as risks affecting macroeconomic and fiscal outcomes.
  27: Natural catastrophes (quake, wind, flood); Weather-related events; Level of
    insurance penetration; Consumption per capita.
  28: Climate change impacts leading to increased natural catastrophe (nat cat) and
    weather-related losses; Underinsurance levels amplify economic vulnerability to
    these events.
Highlights:
  1: A significant protection gap exists for extreme, particularly climate-related,
    risks, with a focus on property insurance markets. Underinsurance is a key component
    of this gap, requiring a detailed understanding of its components and root causes
    to design effective measures.
  7: USA and Japan have the largest expected nat cat losses. Uninsured losses are
    more significant in emerging economies compared to advanced economies. There is
    a gap between current insurance penetration and 'best-practice benchmark', which
    the paper labels 'underinsurance'.
  10: The US, Japan, and China have the largest absolute uninsured natural catastrophe
    risk; Smaller economies like Taiwan, Turkey, Chile, Philippines, Hong Kong, and
    Mexico face significant GDP-related losses from specific natural catastrophes.
  12: Middle-income economies are most underinsured in relation to GDP.
  13: Differences in property insurance penetration across countries are indicated,
    with a focus on underinsurance relative to consumption levels.
  14: Economic development, measured by consumption per capita, is a key driver of
    property insurance penetration; Prior economic growth can have a negative impact
    on penetration, suggesting a lag in insurance development in fast-growing economies;
    Savings and insurance act as substitutes; Urbanization and the share of the industrial
    sector positively impact insurance penetration; Uninsured losses from weather
    and natural catastrophes represent a significant percentage of GDP, particularly
    in emerging economies.
  15: Recent average catastrophe losses (2003-2013) are more significant than older
    losses (1993-2003), possibly due to availability bias. Mortgage penetration is
    a strong driver of insurance penetration. Mobile phone access has a negative correlation
    with insurance penetration, potentially due to multiple SIM card usage in low-income
    countries and the limited availability of mobile insurance products.
  19: Underinsurance issues in context of macroeconomic risk, particularly in emerging
    markets, for property losses due to natural catastrophes.
  20: Taking contingent costs of natural catastrophe damage off government balance
    sheets and into capital markets can reduce fiscal vulnerability to disasters.
  22: Uninsured losses from natural catastrophes and weather events represent a significant
    percentage of GDP, particularly in emerging markets. There appears to be underinsurance
    relative to a best-practice benchmark, implying a potential economic vulnerability.
    The s-curves suggests insurance penetration increases with consumption, but there
    is an "underinsurance" gap to the best-practice benchmark
  26: USA shows the largest expected property damage losses, particularly from uninsured
    earthquakes and winds, indicating significant exposure to natural catastrophe
    damages.
  27: The USA and Japan have the largest expected losses from natural catastrophes.
    Underinsurance is a significant issue, particularly in emerging markets. Uninsured
    losses as a percentage of GDP peaked around 2005 for emerging markets but remained
    relatively stable for advanced markets.
  28: The USA and Japan face the largest expected property damage losses from natural
    catastrophes. Underinsurance significantly exacerbates economic vulnerabilities,
    particularly in emerging markets. There's a gap between actual insurance penetration
    and a 'best-practice benchmark', indicating underinsurance issues.
Methodology:
  1: The paper estimates uninsured expected catastrophe losses using models that combine
    geo-physical vulnerability maps, economic exposure data, and insurance market
    information. It also models each country's expected property insurance penetration
    and compares it to actual penetration to derive a measure of property underinsurance.
    Regression analysis is applied to a panel dataset of 53 countries over a 15-year
    period to identify factors affecting property insurance demand.
  7: Historical data on disaster losses and insured losses are taken from the Swiss
    Re database. Catastrophe simulations use GDP, insurance take-up rate, risk exposure,
    and property concentration as inputs. Econometric analysis is performed, expecting
    savings to have a negative coefficient on insurance purchase decisions, and metrics
    for internet and mobile access to be positive drivers of property insurance. The
    model accounts for political risk, corruption, and Islamic law considerations.
  10: Monte Carlo simulation to estimate expected losses for 30 countries; Model uses
    global hazard maps for windstorm, earthquake, and flood represented with probability
    distributions at the sub-national level; Vulnerability module relates expected
    damage to the intensity of modelled events; Data on the value of insured objects
    is added to yield the expected economic loss potential; Information about insurance
    market conditions is combined with the expected economic loss to estimate what
    proportion of the loss is insured.
  12: Uses a logistic model to estimate a 'best-practice benchmark' (p*) for insurance
    penetration based on cross-sectional data from 45 countries. The 'best-practice
    benchmark' is derived from the top quartile performance within low, medium, and
    high consumption per capita groups. The gap between actual and best practice is
    then used to estimate underinsurance as a percentage of GDP.
  13: The page discusses the evaluation of property insurance penetration against
    consumption per capita using linear and logistic models.
  14: Uses panel data regression analysis (2000-2015 for 51 countries) with various
    model specifications (log-log, log-linear, random effects) to identify drivers
    of property insurance penetration; Employs multivariate specifications to analyze
    insurance buying behavior; Normalizes property premiums by GDP to enable cross-section
    comparisons.
  15: Panel data regressions, random effects regressions, and pairwise correlation
    analysis are used to model the determinants of insurance penetration. Different
    model specifications are tested with various sets of variables. The models' results
    are presented in Table 1.  The data covers the period 1993-2013, as indicated
    by HAZARD and HAZARD2.
  20: Analysis based on macroeconomic impact of natural catastrophe events.
  22: Empirical analysis using data to show trends in disaster losses and insurance
    penetration. The graphs cover different time periods (1990-2015 for the line graphs)
    and are at the national level. The applicability of the results depends on the
    specific countries and time periods considered.
  27: The paper uses sample data to analyze the relationship between consumption per
    capita and insurance penetration, establishing an 's-curve' trend and a 'best-practice
    benchmark'. Panel models are also used to analyse the drivers of insurance penetration.
  28: The analysis uses log-linear and logistic models to estimate GDP impacts under
    climate change scenarios. 'Curve p*' is used as a benchmark. Scenario-based modeled
    protection gap is calculated, as well as property penetration levels. Models look
    at the relationship between consumption, insurance penetration, and GDP.
More Notes:
  1: The paper distinguishes between the 'protection gap' (uninsured portion of losses)
    and 'underinsurance' (difference between economically beneficial insurance and
    actual purchase).  The analysis utilizes historical data and probabilistic models
    to estimate the protection gap, including a unique dataset of property insurance
    premiums for 53 countries.
  7: The paper utilizes proprietary data from Swiss Re regarding property concentration
    and risk exposure by locality.
  12: The study utilizes an 'S-curve' model to represent the relationship between
    economic development and insurance penetration.
  14: The study focuses on property insurance as a mechanism for managing risk related
    to natural catastrophes and weather events, providing insights into factors influencing
    insurance demand and potential underinsurance.
  15: The study finds inconclusive evidence regarding the impact of property rights,
    corruption, and political risk on insurance penetration in multi-variable specifications.
    An insurance price index also showed no significant impact. The share of the Muslim
    population is negatively correlated with insurance penetration, but the evidence
    is inconclusive when combined with other variables.
  19: Recommendations on improving insurance penetration through mandatory schemes
    and developing takaful sector to enhance coverage, particularly in Muslim-majority
    countries.
  22: The distinction between insured and uninsured losses is crucial for understanding
    the financial burden on governments and individuals. The data presented suggests
    a potential role for policies promoting greater insurance penetration, especially
    in emerging economies.
  27: The analysis differentiates between insured and uninsured losses, highlighting
    the financial vulnerability due to lack of insurance coverage. Country income
    level is also considered (High, Medium, Low), as indicated in Table 3.
  28: The analysis seems to compare different model specifications (log-linear vs.
    logistic) and benchmarks to quantify the economic impacts of climate change and
    the role of insurance. The focus is on property damage and GDP effects, with a
    geographical breakdown and consideration of insured vs. uninsured losses.  The
    time horizon for some analyses extends from 1990 to 2015, providing insights into
    trends over time.
