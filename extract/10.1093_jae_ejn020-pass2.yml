Drivers of Risk:
  6: Natural disasters; Climate change; Conflicts; Resource management.
  10: Increased frequency and size of natural hazards, population exposure due to
    choices in living areas, human pressure on resources, and climate change increasing
    natural hazard intensity and frequency.
  12: Natural disasters (drought, earthquake, flood, insect infestation, earth slides,
    volcanic eruptions, waves or surges, and wind storms) and climate change.
  14: Natural disasters
  16: Disasters (earthquakes, droughts)
  17: No relevant information
  20: Humanitarian disasters are triggered by natural hazards but are influenced by
    development flaws like inadequate entitlements and governance.
  22: Natural disasters exacerbated by high vulnerability (due to low development
    levels and lack of adaptive capacity); heavy reliance on climate-sensitive sectors
    like agriculture.
  23: Successive disasters and severe climate change
  24: Combination of natural and human factors (dense rural population, small land
    plots, intensive agriculture, monocultivation) caused landslide in Ecuador; flood
    in Mozambique set back development efforts.
  25: Floods in 2000 and 2001.
  27: Climate change exacerbates issues of desertification, food security, water supply,
    and potential water-related conflicts in Africa.
  28: Climate change impacts such as desertification, food security issues, and water
    supply challenges; conflicts over water resources due to decreased rainfall.
  31: Natural disasters; covariant and difficult to estimate risks; low risk discourages
    agents from paying insurance premiums; soaring risk discourages insurance companies
    from offering coverage; risky behavior of agents knowing they would not bear the
    full costs in case of a disaster.
  32: High covariance risk in insurance schemes and microcredit institutions during
    disasters; Long-term decline in banana prices impacting WINCROP scheme; Natural
    disasters cause loss of housing, livestock, food stores, and productive assets,
    impacting households.
  33: Natural disasters, specifically the costs and risks associated with them.
  34: High exposure to natural hazards like floods, droughts, and wind storms; droughts
    affect a larger number of people in Sub-Saharan Africa, increasing vulnerability
    to disasters.
Highlights:
  6: Need for African governments and development partners to develop a more robust
    adaptation and response capability to disasters as part of their overall development
    planning; Call for more market-based financing mechanisms and emphasis on forecasting
    research.
  10: Disasters are largely manmade with development and disasters closely interlinked,
    and vulnerability is driven by natural hazards and human choices.
  12: A highly vulnerable poor country may suffer frequent disasters that preclude
    development gains and prevent improved resilience, creating a vicious circle.
  14: Natural disasters have severe short-term consequences for the economy but the
    long-term consequences are less clear. Disasters may have no impact on the long-term
    development of a country, or they may negatively influence the path of growth
    and development.
  16: Different types of disasters (e.g., earthquakes vs. droughts) can lead to different
    long-term GDP per capita trajectories; earthquakes may lead to technological change
    and increased growth while droughts may lead to persistent losses.
  17: No relevant information
  20: Natural disasters are not purely natural events; they result from human development
    failures, and improved governance and financial systems can mitigate disaster
    impacts.
  22: Vulnerability can trap countries in a vicious cycle where low development increases
    vulnerability to disasters, which then further hinders development; incorporating
    resilience into development policy is crucial.
  23: Severe climate change could lead to a sharp drop in income and consumption,
    potentially resulting in increased poverty, malnutrition, and mass famines, as
    well as serious disruption to development.
  24: Mozambique's recovery from the flood of 2000 was generally effective and provided
    opportunities for investments to upgrade services and infrastructure. Soft engineering
    approaches and low-energy adaptations are recommended for landslide risk in Ecuador.
  25: High levels of donor response and government commitment to macroeconomic stability
    dampened the negative impacts of the disasters in Mozambique.
  27: Desertification and reduced water supply can lead to vicious cycles impacting
    agricultural productivity and increase water-related conflicts.
  28: Carbon trading is presented as a potentially more lucrative option than traditional
    agriculture in terms of economic returns.
  31: Insurance could reduce aid dependency in managing disasters; parametric insurance,
    triggered by observations like extreme rainfall, is a possible solution for accelerating
    transfers and reducing transaction costs; the government plays a major role by
    providing catastrophe reinsurance to the companies.
  32: Pooling and diversifying risk through schemes like CCRIF can provide lower insurance
    rates; Predetermined parametric triggers reduce transaction costs and moral hazard;
    Market-based risk-spreading options like insurance can be a valuable investment;
    Government backstops are essential for microcredit institutions during disasters.
  33: International aid can minimize long-term negative economic impact of natural
    disasters, especially for highly indebted poor countries where debt service crowds
    out other resource uses.
  34: Disasters have a huge impact on poverty and economic outcomes; only two countries
    in Sub-Saharan Africa incorporated hazard risk management in their Poverty Reduction
    Strategy Papers.
Methodology:
  6: Outlining a framework for thinking about the links among natural disasters, climate
    change, and economic development.
  10: Vulnerability is analyzed as a function of natural hazard intensity, population
    exposure, and resilience.
  12: The paper uses case studies, theory, and other evidence to link climate change
    and disasters, and to understand how development choices have led to differing
    levels of vulnerability.
  14: Theoretical and empirical analyses of long-term economic impact of natural disasters,
    macroeconomic modeling using economic linkage and substitution effects, consideration
    of capital stock loss and replacement cost
  16: Conceptual scenarios of disaster impact on GDP per capita over time.

    catastrophe bonds, and flexible aid disbursements as risk-spreading mechanisms.
More Notes:
  6: The paper argues for more work on the links between climate change and disasters
    and suggests a new way of looking at disaster resilience.
  10: Economic development strategies impact vulnerability by influencing human pressure
    on resources.
  12: The paper identifies a need for further research, including country case studies,
    to better understand the linkages between climate change, disasters, development
    choices, and vulnerability.
  14: The paper discusses arguments for both positive and negative impacts of natural
    disasters on long-term growth. It presents contrasting views on whether resources
    used after a disaster are additional or have high opportunity costs.
  17: No relevant information
  20: The willingness of governments to prioritize preparedness and the role of institutions
    in enforcing codes are critical for resilience.
  22: Adaptive capacity requires technical know-how, resources for research, technology,
    risk-sharing mechanisms (insurance, government assistance), and emergency response
    capabilities, all of which are costly and require high-quality institutions and
    human capital.
  27: The document underscores that the poor will be most affected by water scarcity,
    which has wider economic implications, even threatening industrial activity.
  32: African countries should pay attention to initiatives like CCRIF and conceive
    their own solutions for risk management.
  33: Debt relief circumvents delays in fund release from donors after disasters.
    Shift from ex post to ex ante conditionality in aid could reduce delays and moral
    hazard. Investments in early warning systems can reduce financial costs of disasters.
    There is much room for improvement in climate forecasting in Africa.
  34: Development strategies that include better water and land management, infrastructure,
    and housing can reduce vulnerability to natural hazards.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  6: Long-term economic impact of natural disasters; Disaster resilience as a continuum
    to development strategies.
  12: Development gains can be precluded by frequent disasters in vulnerable poor
    countries, preventing improved resilience, suggesting a negative impact on economic
    development.
  14: GDP growth, macroeconomic indicators
  16: GDP per capita, long-term growth rate of the economy.
  17: No relevant information
  20: Development strategies impact macroeconomic resilience by determining vulnerability
    to disasters and shaping resource entitlements.
  22: Development can be set back by decades due to disasters; high vulnerability
    leads to instability and disconnection from growth.
  23: GDP per capita
  24: Landslide in Ecuador caused several million dollars in damage to agricultural
    lands, factories, and residential infrastructure; flood in Mozambique devastated
    140,000 hectares of crops, caused loss of livestock, damaged fishing, destroyed
    schools.
  25: The 2000 and 2001 floods in Mozambique were not considered to have had a lasting
    negative economic impact.
  27: No relevant information
  28: Adaptation strategies such as improved resource management and international
    carbon trading are suggested for economic benefits, with examples of potential
    returns on carbon sequestration investments being higher than agricultural returns.
  31: Aid flows might not be able to cope with the rapid increase in the annual cost
    of disasters; special funding mechanisms for disasters may actually lead to avoidance
    of the more fundamental choices countries must make to build disaster management
    into their development strategies; insurance could reduce aid dependency in managing
    disasters; government serving as a backstop facility transfers the risk from the
    local to the national level
  32: Post-disaster pressure on fiscal and external balances can be reduced through
    instruments like catastrophe bonds; Immediate cash payment following a major earthquake
    or hurricane will help governments fund immediate postdisaster recovery.
  33: Long-term economic effects due to high insurance costs diverting capital from
    investment or other high opportunity cost spending.
