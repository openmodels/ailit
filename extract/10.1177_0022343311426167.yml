Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change increases the frequency and severity of climate-related disasters
    like flash floods, surges, cyclones, and severe storms.
  2: "Climate-related natural disasters (flash floods, surges, cyclones, blizzards,\
    \ severe storms); Severity and frequency of climate-related disasters (IPCC, 2007:\
    \ 43\u201354)."
  3: Climatic natural disasters (droughts, extreme temperatures, wildfires, floods),
    global warming, weather-related disasters, economic growth shocks, sudden changes
    in economic growth.
  4: Climate-related disasters (floods, winds, storms, tropical cyclones) are the
    primary drivers of risk.
  5: The study investigates the impact of climatic disasters (large disasters, population
    affected by disasters - floods and storms) on economic growth.
  6: Climate-related disasters (floods and storms)
  7: Natural disasters such as floods, storms, and other climate-related disasters
    are identified as shocks impacting economic growth.
  8: Climatic disasters, including both large-scale disasters and variation in smaller
    disasters like floods and storms.
  10: Earthquakes, Volcanoes, Droughts, Climate-related disasters
  11: Climatic disasters.
  13: Conflict onset, Conflict incidence, War
  14: Sudden climatic disasters (storms and floods)
  16: Natural disasters, external shocks, economic shocks, climate-related natural
    disasters, crime, floods.
Highlights:
  1: Climate-related natural disasters negatively affect growth but do not increase
    the risk of armed conflict.
  2: Climate-related disasters have a negative impact on economic growth; Climate-related
    natural disasters do not have any direct effect on conflict onset; Economic shocks
    caused by climate-related disasters do not have an effect on conflict onset.
  3: The impact of natural disasters on economic growth is ambiguous and may vary
    depending on the nature of the disaster. Low income levels and negative income
    shocks are associated with increased risk of armed conflict. There is an endogeneity
    problem between low income growth and conflict, making causal inference difficult.
  4: Climate-related disasters have a negative effect on economic growth, and negative
    income growth shocks caused by climate-related disasters increase the likelihood
    of armed civil conflict onset.
  5: Climate-related disasters are found to be a better instrument for economic growth
    in global panel studies than rainfall and temperature variation.
  7: Natural disasters occurring at different times of the year can have varying impacts
    on current and future economic growth.
  8: Both large-scale and smaller-scale climatic disasters negatively impact economic
    growth, with significant and similar coefficients for floods and storms.
  10: Climate-related disasters and other natural disasters have statistically significant
    negative impacts on GDP/capita growth.
  11: Climate-related disasters lead to a significant reduction in economic growth
    and increased risk of armed conflict onset.
  13: Conflict onset and incidence, and war events appear to negatively impact GDP/capita
    growth, based on statistically significant coefficients (indicated by *, **, ***).
  14: Storms and floods adversely affect people and production inputs, leading to
    negative income shocks.
Methodology:
  1: The article uses econometric methods to study consequences of climate-induced
    natural disasters on economic growth and conflict onset.
  2: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and panel data, fixed-effects methods, two-stage
    least squares (2SLS) analysis, instrumenting growth using climatic disasters.
    Considers small-scale events, controls for unobserved factors, and distinguishes
    different disaster types.
  3: Empirical analysis using econometric techniques, panel data analysis, instrumental
    variables (rainfall, deviations in temperature and rainfall from long-run averages),
    lagged regressors, 2SLS instrumental variable approach, reduced-form relation
    analysis.
  4: Fixed-effects models are used to analyze the relationship between climate events,
    economic growth, disasters, and conflict onset. The study distinguishes between
    the effect of climate events on economic growth and the effect of disasters and
    growth on armed conflict.
  5: Panel data analysis covering 171 countries from 1980-2007 is used. The study
    uses climate-related events as exogenous events to examine the impact on economic
    growth. The analysis includes lagged control variables and country fixed effects.
  6: "Uses disaster data from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT). Normalizes disasters\
    \ similarly to Noy (2009). Considers only climate-related disasters sorting under\
    \ the disaster classes \u2018floods\u2019 and \u2018storms\u2019 in EM-DAT."
  7: Economic growth model includes control variables like lagged GDP per capita growth,
    trade openness, FDI, investment share of GDP, government expenditure, and CPI
    inflation, all lagged by one year.
  8: Analysis performed using two-way error component regression models with lagged
    economic growth and control variables such as openness to trade, investment, government
    expenditure, and inflation.
  10: Panel regressions are used with country and time fixed effects. STATA is used
    for estimation. The analysis covers different time periods (1970-2007, 1980-2007).
    Robustness tests are performed.
  11: Instrumental variable analysis; examining the impact of climate-related disasters
    on economic growth and conflict onset using a structural equation model and reduced-form
    specifications.
  13: Regression analysis, including instrumental variable (IV) estimation and fixed
    effects models. The analysis considers country-specific trends and uses splines
    and cubic terms. Robust standard errors are clustered at some level. Democracy
    index is used.
  14: Empirical analysis of the period 1980-2007
  16: Instrumental variables approach is mentioned in the context of economic shocks
    and civil conflict.
More Notes:
  2: The study differs from previous work by considering small disasters, using fixed-effects
    methods, and only looking at climatic disasters that come as sudden shocks and
    last for no longer than one month.
  3: The page discusses the challenges of identifying a causal relationship between
    climatic disasters, economic growth, and conflict, highlighting the importance
    of addressing endogeneity issues through instrumental variable approaches. Several
    studies challenge others' findings.
  5: The paper suggests that consequences of natural disasters differ across countries
    due to factors like culture, infrastructure, and political institutions. Endogeneity
    issues related to rainfall are also addressed.
  6: The study uses the number of people affected by a disaster as the main variable
    of interest.
  7: Population impacted is also part of the analysis, such as in major disasters
    affecting up to 62% of the population in some cases.
  10: The table presents regression results with various control variables, including
    population, investment, government expenditure, trade, FDI, and inflation. The
    R-squared values suggest varying degrees of explanatory power for the models.
  13: The table describes the setup and results of various regression models. The
    units of variables may be in levels or logs, and the impacts may vary depending
    on the model specification. The regressions include controls for population, time
    since conflict onset, and climate-related variables such as affected population
    from floods and storms.
  14: The short-term negative effect of climate-induced disasters on economic growth
    does not increase the risk of conflict onset in the following two-year period.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Climate-related natural disasters have a negative effect on economic growth.
  2: Economic growth; Income changes; Demand and supply shocks; Shifting terms of
    trade; Increased inflation.
  3: Economic growth, income levels, budget balance (implied through discussion of
    infrastructure projects and emergency aid), civil conflict, economic institutions.
  4: Economic growth is negatively affected by climate-related disasters due to damage
    to production inputs, infrastructure, and displacement of people.
  5: Real GDP per capita growth (%) is analyzed as a dependent variable.
  6: Average annual real GDP per capita growth

    reductions in short-run and long-run growth.
  10: GDP/capita growth
  11: Negative impact on short-run economic growth and the likelihood of armed civil
    conflict onset.
  13: GDP/capita growth

    in low-income countries, macroeconomic costs of natural disasters.
Quantitative material:
  2: OLS and panel data analysis on climate-related disasters and short-run economic
    growth.
  3: Skidmore & Toya (2002) report a positive link between persistent climatic events
    and economic growth, Loyza et al. (2009) find a positive effect on economic growth
    from floods and a negative effect from droughts, Raddatz (2007, 2009) reports
    that large-scale climatic disasters are negatively linked to economic growth,
    Noy (2009) reports a negative effect on growth. Miguel, Satyanath & Sergenti (2004)
    find that a one percentage point decrease in rainfall raises the likelihood of
    a country experiencing conflict incidence by about two percentage points and conflict
    onset by three percentage points. Bernauer et al. (2012) find no significant link
    between climate variability, economic growth, and the risk of conflict onset.
  4: A one-degree Celsius increase in temperature will increase the risk of armed
    civil conflict by as much as 4.5 percentage points.
  5: Descriptive statistics are provided for real GDP per capita growth, large disasters,
    and population affected by disasters (mean, standard deviation, min, max, and
    N).
  6: "Average annual real GDP per capita growth was 1.7% during the period 1980\u2013\
    2007; Extreme values range from \u201365.1% to 123.3%"
  7: Table I indicates on average less than 0.45% of the population needs immediate
    assistance due to climate-related natural disasters.
  8: When the weighted population affected by disasters increases by one standard
    deviation, economic growth is predicted to reduce by 0.38 percentage points in
    the same year.
  10: Multiple regression results are presented, showing coefficients and t-statistics
    for various models. Significant negative impacts on GDP/capita growth are found
    in relation to disaster variables. For example, in several models, climate-related
    disasters negatively affect GDP/capita growth.
  11: Estimated growth reduction is 0.18 percentage points per percentage point increase
    in the disaster variable.
  13: Regression coefficients and t-statistics are reported for the impact of conflict
    and war variables on GDP/capita growth.
  14: An increase by one standard deviation in the number of people affected by sudden
    climatic disasters leads to a total aggregate income growth reduction of about
    0.5 percentage points.
