Drivers of Risk:
  5: Temperature frequency changes and their impact on mortality risk.
  7: Temperature frequency (extreme cold, extreme hot, moderate cold, moderate hot)

Highlights:
  2: Observed a consistent decrease in the risk of mortality as the normalized frequency
    of temperature increases globally.
  5: Higher mortality risk associated with temperate climates and in high-income countries
    due to temperature frequency changes.
  7: Mortality risk decreases as temperature frequency increases; A higher increase
    in mortality risk was observed for extreme cold compared to other temperature
    components when comparing low to high frequencies; Socio-economic status and climate
    characteristics were potential modifiers of the frequency-related mortality risk;
    The most frequent temperature has the minimum mortality risk, and this linear
    association holds consistently across distinct geographical locations; Populations
    develop better resilience to the temperatures they encounter most frequently.

  9: The paper provides a better understanding of the underlying mechanism responsible
    for the health consequences of temperature. The study suggests populations can
    adapt to their local climate through frequent exposure to increased temperature
    frequency.
Methodology:
  2: Uses a two-stage time series design to assess the association between temperature
    frequency and mortality.
  5: Analysis uses relative risks calculated from normalized temperature frequencies
    and stratified by climatic zones and socio-economic status.
  7: Multi-country, population-based study analyzing the association between temperature
    frequency and mortality risk; Temperature frequency is used to facilitate cross-location
    comparisons, avoiding biases from pooling data across diverse locations with different
    temperature distributions; Analysis considers socioeconomic status and climate
    characteristics as potential modifiers of the frequency-related mortality risk.

More Notes:
  7: Temperature frequency is introduced as a valuable concept for understanding temperature-mortality
    relationships. The study suggests that adaptation plays a key role, with populations
    showing greater resilience to frequently occurring temperatures. Identical temperatures
    may exhibit varying frequencies across different locations leading to disparate
    adaptation patterns.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  5: Increase in mortality risk with varying temperature frequencies, which could
    indirectly affect macroeconomic outcomes through health impacts.

Quantitative material:
  5: Increase in mortality risk for temperate climates is reported as a percentage
    change of 14.79% and 13.58% for high-income countries.
  7: 'Percentage change of mortality comparing the 10th percentile to the 100th percentile
    of normalized frequency of temperature by socio-economic status and climatic zones;
    for example, in tropical climates: 11.50% (9.77, 13.25)'
