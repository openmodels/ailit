Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature frequency is the driver of mortality risk.
  2: The paper discusses the impact of temperature frequency on mortality, noting
    changes in temperature exposure and adaptation.
  3: Temperature frequency (number of days for each specific temperature) is the driver
    of risk being evaluated.
  4: The frequency of different temperature components (extreme cold, extreme hot,
    moderate cold, extreme cold) acts as the driver of mortality risk.
  5: Temperature frequency changes impact the mortality risks.
  6: Temperature (specifically, comparison of the 10th percentile to the 100th percentile
    of normalized temperature frequency)
  7: Temperature frequency (extreme cold, extreme hot, moderate cold, moderate hot).
  8: Frequency of exposure to hot and cold temperatures, socioeconomic factors, and
    climate zone are drivers of mortality risk.
  9: Increased temperature frequency is a driver of risk.
  10: Short-term temperature variability is the primary driver of risk examined.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Mortality is being evaluated in relation to temperature frequency.
  2: The paper provides an overview of the association between temperature frequency
    and all-cause mortality.
  3: This study evaluates the association between temperature frequency and mortality
    risk.
  4: Mortality risk is evaluated in relation to temperature frequency.
  5: The outcome being evaluated is the association between temperature frequency
    and all-cause mortality.
  6: Mortality
  7: Evaluates all-cause mortality.
  8: Mortality risk associated with temperature frequency is evaluated.
  9: This study focuses on the health consequences of temperature.
  10: The paper by Y. Wu et al. (2022) evaluates the burden of mortality associated
    with short-term temperature variability.
Highlights:
  1: Assessing adaptation to local temperature.
  2: Populations can adapt to frequent temperature exposure, with adapting abilities
    varying geographically based on climatic and socioeconomic characteristics.
  3: The study aims to evaluate the association between temperature frequency and
    mortality risk. It also aims to examine variations in human adaptation to diverse
    temperatures.
  4: Mortality risks were strongest on the present day and attenuated drastically
    to lag day 21.
  5: The greatest mortality risk increase is observed in temperate climates and high-income
    countries.
  6: The percentage change in mortality associated with a shift from the 10th percentile
    temperature to the most frequent temperature is presented for different regions.
    The overall percentage change across all regions is also summarized.
  7: Mortality risk decreases as temperature frequency increases. Populations develop
    better resilience to frequently encountered temperatures. Temperature frequency
    helps explain differing mortality risks associated with the same temperature value
    in different locations.
  8: Human adaptation to temperature varies depending on temperature components; greater
    reduction in mortality risk with increased frequency of cold temperatures compared
    to hot temperatures. Climate zone is an important determinant of frequency-related
    mortality risk.
  9: Populations can adapt to their local climate through frequent exposure.
Methodology:
  1: Multi-Country Multi-City (MCC) Collaborative Network
  2: The analysis uses a two-stage time series design with daily data from 757 locations
    across 47 countries/regions from 1979-2020, assessing mortality risk associated
    with temperature frequency.
  3: A two-stage time-series quasi-Poisson regression design is used. In the first
    stage, a quasi-Poisson regression is applied in each location to derive estimates
    of associations between mortality and normalized frequency of temperature. In
    the second stage, a multilevel meta-analytical model without predictors is used
    to pool location-specific estimates at the national, regional, and global levels.
    A distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) is used.
  4: The analysis covers the period 1990-2010 across 757 locations from 47 countries/regions.
  5: Relative risks are calculated using a reference normalized frequency to evaluate
    cumulative associations.
  6: The analysis compares mortality rates at the 10th percentile to the 100th percentile
    (most frequent temperature) of normalized temperature frequency. The results are
    presented in a forest plot showing percentage changes and 95% confidence intervals
    for different countries/regions.
  7: Multi-country, population-based study using temperature frequency to understand
    temperature-mortality relationships. Linear relationship between temperature frequency
    and mortality risk is suggested, applicable at national, regional, and global
    levels. Temperature frequency facilitates cross-location comparisons.
  8: The study compares temperature-mortality associations across locations to identify
    common phenomena and how populations adapt to local temperatures.
  9: This is a secondary analysis of aggregate anonymized data from the MCC Collaborative
    Research Network.
  10: The Wu et al. (2022) study uses a three-stage modeling approach to examine the
    relationship between temperature variability and mortality, applicable from 2000-2019.

  4: Climatic zone and socioeconomic status were considered as potential indicators
    of population adaptation.
  7: The minimum mortality risk is associated with the most frequent temperature.
    Socio-economic status and climate characteristics are potential modifiers of frequency-related
    mortality risk. The study suggests a linear relationship between temperature frequency
    and mortality risk.
  8: The study acknowledges limitations including inability to characterize frequency-mortality
    association by age, sex, and cause of death, and limited data availability for
    certain regions.
