Drivers of Risk:
  3: Global temperature change is impacting economic activity.
  4: Physical deterioration, normal obsolescence, normal accidental damage to fixed
    assets.
  5: Shocks include fires, storms, human error for normal damage; war and major natural
    disasters for infrequent losses.
  7: Hurricanes (Katrina and Rita) and associated disaster costs.
  9: Climate change (implied through BEA and NOAA costs).
  10: Billion-dollar weather and climate disasters.
  12: Climate change (implied)
  15: Major earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tidal waves, exceptionally severe hurricanes,
    drought, other natural disasters, acts of war, riots, other political events,
    technological accidents such as major toxic spills or release of radioactive particles
    into the air, deterioration in the quality of land caused by abnormal flooding
    or wind damage, destruction of cultivated assets by drought or outbreaks of disease,
    destruction of buildings, equipment or valuables in forest fires or earthquakes.
Highlights:
  3: Variability in economic impact estimates across different modeling approaches
    with increase in global temperatures.
  4: No relevant information
  6: Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and predictable.
  7: Including full disaster costs in CFC introduces volatility. A trend-based approach
    is suggested as a smoother and potentially better proxy for expected costs.
  9: Real costs are increasing over time. There is significant volatility in the raw
    cost data.
  10: Disaster costs, while relatively small as a portion of NDP, are growing over
    time.
  15: Large-scale, discrete, and recognizable events that destroy a significant number
    of assets are recorded as catastrophic losses.
Methodology:
  3: Analysis based on statistical, structural modeling, meta-analyses, and AR5 methods.
  4: No relevant information
  5: Normal accidental damage is included in consumption of fixed capital; losses
    from infrequent events like natural disasters are recorded in the other changes
    in the volume of assets account.
  6: Suggests a change in how asset damage from weather and climate disasters is accounted
    for in national accounts; specifically, including it in 'consumption of capital'
    rather than 'Other Changes in the Volume of Assets'.
  7: Compares the current System of National Accounts (SNA) treatment of disaster
    costs in CFC with the pre-2008 SNA method used by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis
    (BEA), and proposes including a trend of expected disaster costs in CFC instead
    of the full disaster costs.
  10: Analysis tracks disaster costs, NDP, and CFC from 1980 to 2023 (though the provided
    table only goes to 1985), calculating ratios to assess the economic impact of
    disasters.
  12: Uses a trend as an estimate; Uses the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to create a
    real series
  15: Accounting for catastrophic losses within the 'other changes in the volume of
    assets account' in the System of National Accounts.
More Notes:
  6: The proposal implies that damage from weather/climate disasters should be treated
    as a regular cost of economic activity (consumption of capital) rather than as
    an unusual or exceptional event.
  7: The page discusses how to account for disaster costs related to climate change
    within national accounts (specifically, capital consumption allowance) and their
    impact on measured economic activity.
  10: The data source is NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (2024),
    with contributions from Adam Smith of NOAA, Haver, and the authors' calculations.
    This suggests the data is empirically based.
  12: The paper assumes unbiased expectations.
  13: This page is very limited and only highlights areas for future research. It
    does not provide any specific findings or methodological details.
  15: The text focuses on identifying events that lead to significant asset losses,
    which are then accounted for in the national accounts. It does not provide quantitative
    estimates of macroeconomic or fiscal impacts or analyze adaptation strategies.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  4: No relevant information
  5: Losses of fixed assets due to normal or expected levels of accidental damage
    are part of consumption of fixed capital; large disasters are not included.
  6: Asset damage
  7: Capital consumption allowance (CFC) is directly impacted by disaster costs.
  9: Average annual costs related to climate change.
  10: Impact of billion-dollar weather and climate disasters on Net Domestic Product
    (NDP) and Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFC).
  12: Expected losses
  15: Destruction of assets impacting national accounts.
Quantitative material:
  3: Scatter plots and trend lines in panels for GDP percentage change with global
    warming.
  4: No relevant information
  7: Quarterly annualized CFC fell by 5.8% in Q2 2005 and rose by 18.9% in Q3 2005
    due to hurricanes.
  9: The figure shows average annual midpoint costs from BEA and NOAA in billions
    of 2023 US dollars, deflated by CPI-U, and a trend line.
  10: 'Disaster costs are quantified in billions of dollars and as a percentage of
    NDP and CFC. Examples: 0.12% of NDP in 1980, 0.40% in 2023; 0.67% of CFC in 1980,
    1.95% in 2013.'
