Drivers of Risk:
  3: Global temperature change above pre-industrial
  6: Extreme weather events are more frequent and likely to become more so.
  8: Floods, storms, fires, droughts, heat waves are the weather and climate disasters
    considered.
  9: 'Implied: Climate-related events impacting BEA and NOAA costs'
  10: Billion-dollar weather and climate disasters.
  15: Major earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tidal waves, exceptionally severe hurricanes,
    drought and other natural disasters; acts of war, riots and other political events;
    and technological accidents such as major toxic spills or release of radioactive
    particles into the air.
Evaluation overview:
  3: Global aggregate economic impact
  8: Asset costs of disasters (capital losses, with some non-asset costs included
    in NOAA data).
  9: BEA and NOAA costs
  10: Economic impact of billion-dollar weather and climate disasters.
  15: Catastrophic losses in the volume of assets.
Highlights:
  3: Economic impact appears to become more severe as global temperature change increases,
    depicted by the rising trends in the graphs.
  6: Proposal to include the trend for asset damage from weather and climate disasters
    in consumption of capital rather than Other Changes in the Volume of Assets.
  9: Real value increasing over time. Volatility of raw data is evident and substantial.
  10: The portion of NDP constituted by disaster costs is relatively small but growing.
Methodology:
  3: Statistical modeling, Structural modeling, Meta analyses, IPCC AR5 various methods
  8: NOAA collects data back to 1980 on US weather and climate disasters. NOAA data
    is based mainly on government and private insurance data, extrapolated to cover
    uninsured claims. BEA data mainly includes only very big disasters. Asset costs
    of disasters can be estimated by combining the two sources, using roughly 2/3
    of NOAA's cost estimates and double BEA's.
  9: Average annual midpoint of BEA and NOAA costs is calculated, and a trend is calculated.
    The trend calculation is robust to different methods.
More Notes:
  3: The graphic is attributed to the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report, 2022.
  4: This excerpt provides a definition of "Consumption of fixed capital" from the
    System of National Accounts (SNA08). While the concept might indirectly relate
    to climate impacts (e.g., damage to infrastructure from extreme weather), the
    provided text itself does not directly address climate impacts, drivers, or quantification.
    It sets a stage for accounting principles, but needs further context to be directly
    useful for a climate impact review.
  8: NOAA data includes roughly 2/3 capital losses. NOAA data does not include mortality
    or morbidity, nor indirect costs such as downstream business interruption. BEA
    data does not include non-asset costs.
  10: The provided table data spans the years 1980-1985 and 2015-2023, offering a
    basis for examining the evolving economic influence of climate-related events.
Quantitative material:
  3: Graphs show economic impact estimates (y-axis) as a function of global temperature
    change (x-axis)
  8: "Disasters with costs greater than $1 billion (in today\u2019s dollars, CPI deflated)\
    \ are considered by NOAA. BEA measures disasters bigger than 0.1% of GDP."
  9: Real midpoint costs and trend are shown in billions of 2023 US dollars
