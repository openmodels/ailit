Drivers of Risk:
  1: Variation of weather variables (temperature)
  2: Annual variation of weather variables like temperature and precipitation, impacting
    economic outcomes.
  3: Temperature and precipitation deviations from long-run climate.
  4: Weather shocks and climate change (specifically, temperature and precipitation)
  5: Monthly temperature and precipitation anomalies. Future climate change projections
    based on RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios using temperature data from the COSMO-CLM regional
    circulation model.
  6: Temperature changes (weather effects).
  7: Temperature and precipitation are considered as drivers of risk, specifically
    focusing on the impact of temperature.
  8: Changes in temperature and precipitation.
  10: Temperature deviations (positive and negative) from historical norms, precipitation
    changes
  11: Temperature change (global warming under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios)
  12: Climate change, specifically temperature changes under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
  13: Temperature change (global warming).
  14: Temperature change under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.
  15: Temperature change
  16: Average temperature and precipitation deviations (positive and negative) from
    historical norms (moving averages of the past 30 years).
  17: Persistent increases in temperatures based on the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
Highlights:
  1: Statistically significant effects of temperature on GDP and agricultural reaction
    function are from a levels specification; Slight average effects for GDP per-capita,
    but important losses in agriculture due to persistent increase in average temperatures.
  2: Temperature shocks exhibit non-linear level effects; main projection shows persistent
    temperature increase results in small GDP per capita impact but substantial agricultural
    GVA loss.
  3: Model specification matters greatly for long-run projections of climate damage.
  4: The paper argues that panel fixed effects models with quadratic weather specifications
    can capture a mix of short-run and long-run effects of climate change. The weighting
    depends on the relative magnitude of time-series variation in weather versus cross-unit
    variation in climate. Under certain conditions, the estimated marginal effect
    of weather will be heavily influenced by adaptation to local climate, so that
    the marginal effect of weather tends to coincide with the marginal effect of climate
    at the margin.
  5: "Finds a smoothing non-linear and concave-in-temperature relationship between\
    \ temperature and economic outcomes, with a maximum around 12-14\xB0C for GDP\
    \ per capita and agricultural GVA per worker, respectively.  This effect is particularly\
    \ evident for the agricultural sector, highlighting the greater sensitivity of\
    \ agriculture to temperature."
  6: Models including linear time trends perform poorly in out-of-sample prediction.
    The linear-in-growth DJO1 and non-linear-in-levels NPS models perform best in
    forecast CV for both GDP per capita and agricultural productivity. Models that
    assume heterogeneity of weather effects by income level (DJO2 and KAHN2) are not
    preferred in out-of-sample prediction for agriculture.
  7: There is difficulty in discriminating between growth vs level models or between
    linear vs non-linear models in out-of-sample prediction, suggesting model uncertainty.
    A non-linear (quadratic) relationship between temperature and GDP per capita is
    not statistically significant in the Italian data, contrasting with previous global
    studies. Temperature effects on GDP are often statistically insignificant. Temperature
    is more relevant than precipitation, and weather variables are more important
    in agriculture.
  8: "Non-linear (quadratic) temperature specifications in GDP levels perform better\
    \ econometrically than linear growth models. Estimated maximizing GDP temperature\
    \ for Italy is 17.5\xB0C (95% quantile range 14.2-20.9\xB0C). A 1\xB0C increase\
    \ in temperature reduces agricultural labor productivity in 'poor' provinces by\
    \ around 5% points in the DJO1 model."
  11: "The paper produces two sets of projections: with and without boundary on the\
    \ max temperature. In  the  first  case,  Ti,    t+is  equal  to  the  estimated\
    \  projected  temperature without       any       restriction.       In      \
    \ the        second       case,       following        Burke       et       al.\
    \ (2015), we conservatively cap Ti, t+at 20.2 \u25E6C"
  12: The impact of climate change varies significantly across Italian provinces.
    Northern provinces may experience slight positive GDP gains under less severe
    scenarios, while Southern provinces are likely to face GDP losses, particularly
    under high-emission scenarios. The agricultural sector is projected to suffer
    significant losses, with the magnitude varying depending on the climate scenario
    and geographic location. Model selection has a notable uncertainty on the outcome,
    confirming the heterogeneity of the Italian climate.
  13: Climate change damage in agriculture overlaps with findings at aggregated level.
  14: Temperature changes are projected to negatively impact per-capita GDP and agricultural
    GVA per-worker at the provincial level in Italy during 2080-2100, with RCP8.5
    showing more severe impacts than RCP4.5, particularly in southern regions for
    GDP and more widespread losses for GVA.
  15: The NPS model generally has the lowest RMSE in the Backcast Cross-Validation
    for both GDP per-capita and Agricultural GVA per-worker when province-time trends
    are not included. The specifications with the lowest RMSE are highlighted in bold
    in Table A.1.
  16: Positive deviations in temperature significantly increase GDP per capita growth.
    The effect of temperature deviations on GDP growth and Agriculture GVA per-worker
    growth is different for poor provinces. There is a significantly negative impact
    of temperature deviations on Agriculture GVA per-worker growth in poor provinces.
  17: Under RCP 8.5 scenario, Italy could experience a 2.72% loss in GDP per capita
    and a 10.44% loss in GVA per-worker by 2100.
Methodology:
  1: Panel data econometrics (110 Italian provinces, 1980-2014), non-linear temperature
    effects, weather variables and economic outcomes in first differences.
  2: Panel data econometrics using inter-annual variation of weather variables and
    a non-linear (quadratic) model across Italian regions (NUTS3 level) from 1980
    to 2014.
  3: The study compares different econometric specifications (DJO1, DJO2, BHM, NPS,
    KAHN1, KAHN2) using in-sample statistics and out-of-sample predictive performances
    obtained from cross-validation exercises (forecast CV, backcast CV, k-fold CV).
    The models include province and time fixed effects and are estimated with and
    without province-specific time trends.
  4: Panel fixed effects models are used to analyze the relationship between weather/climate
    and economic outcomes at the NUTS3 level in Italy. The paper compares models with
    linear and non-linear (quadratic) specifications for weather variables. The study
    covers the period from 1980 to 2014. The models account for fixed effects and
    trends. Some models also include heterogeneity with respect to income.
  5: Uses a Cambridge Econometrics' Regional Database based on Eurostat, combined
    with weather data constructed using the anomaly method. Employs fractional polynomial
    regression to model the relationship between economic outcomes and temperature.
    Cross-validation exercises are used to assess model performance in out-of-sample
    prediction.
  6: Forecast cross-validation (CV) using five training windows beginning in 1981
    and ending in various years up to 2010, with test periods spanning five years
    after each training window. Backcast CV is also used as a robustness check. Fractional
    Polynomial regression is used to fit relationships between temperature and economic
    outcomes.
  7: The analysis uses out-of-sample cross-validation (k-fold CV) to compare different
    econometric models (linear and non-linear, levels and growth rate) in predicting
    GDP per capita and Agriculture GVA per-worker. Welch t-tests are used to assess
    the statistical significance of differences in RMSE between models. Econometric
    models include DJO, BHM, NPS and KHAN specifications. Standard errors are clustered
    by province and province-year. The analysis is applicable to Italian data.
  8: Panel data regressions using different specifications (DJO, BHM, NPS) with and
    without quadratic temperature terms, interaction terms with poverty indicators,
    and precipitation controls. Robust standard errors clustered within NUTS3 regions.
    GDP growth and level specifications are considered. Bootstrap procedure for estimating
    the maximizing GDP temperature.
  10: The study uses an ARDL model to assess the impact of temperature and precipitation
    deviations on GDP per capita growth and agricultural GVA per-worker growth. The
    model is estimated with both standard fixed effects and the half-panel Jackknife
    FE (XTSPJ) estimator. The analysis is performed on Italian provinces, with a focus
    on long-run effects.
  11: "Uses a non-linear specification (NPS) model to project GDP and GVA changes\
    \ based on temperature projections from the COSMO-CLM model forced by the CMCC-CM\
    \ model. Projects based on the average growth rate of per capita GDP (or GVA per-worker)\
    \ during the 1980\u20132014 period and applies temperature-induced variation to\
    \ project future GDP."
  12: Econometric analysis at the provincial level in Italy using both growth and
    level models (linear and non-linear) to model the impact of temperature on GDP
    and agricultural GVA. The analysis uses historical data and climate change projections
    up to the end of the century (average between 2080 and 2100).
  13: Projections based on NPS econometric results reported in Table 4 (column 5)
    and Table 5 (column 5).
  14: Econometric analysis using non-linear panel methods; Projections based on NPS
    econometric results reported in Tables 4 and 5, column 5.
  15: The study uses econometric models to project the effect of temperature change
    on GDP per capita in Italy. The models include DJO1, DJO2, BHM, NPS, KHAN1 and
    KHAN2. Backcast and K-fold cross-validation are used to assess model performance.
    They use training windows ending in 2015 with test periods that span the five
    years preceding the beginning of the training window.
  16: 'The analysis uses panel data regressions with province fixed effects and trends.
    Two estimation methods are used: xtreg (fixed effects model) and xtspj (half-panel
    jackknife fixed effects estimator). K-fold cross-validation is performed. Historical
    norms are defined as moving averages of the past 30 years.'
  17: Uses eqs. 22 in Kahn et al. (2019), and econometric estimated coefficients from
    XTSPJ specifications 2 (average effects for Italy) and XTSPJ specification 3 (average
    effects for rich and poor provinces) of Tables A.4 and A.5, respectively. Numbers
    are GDP (2014) weighted averages of the estimated impacts at provinces level.
More Notes:
  1: The study addresses model uncertainty by exploring linear/non-linear effects
    of weather variables on economic outcomes.
  2: Study emphasizes North-South heterogeneity in economic impacts within Italy due
    to climate change.
  3: The paper tests whether weather variables effect is heterogeneous with respect
    to income, using a 'poor' dummy variable.
  4: The paper acknowledges that the relationship between outcome and weather needs
    to be non-linear for weather to be reflective of climate effects. Also, the results
    may only hold true if the outcome variable is a maximized quantity from economic
    agents. The paper addresses the potential bias in panel fixed effects models due
    to the skewness of weather variable distributions.
  5: Considers temperature and precipitation of the main city of each province as
    well as average weather over farmland areas. Downscales modeled climate scenarios
    using observed records to remove bias. Focuses on the Italian context, reassessing
    existing literature on the linearity vs. non-linearity and growth vs. levels effects
    of weather variables on economic outcomes.
  8: The paper highlights the importance of sub-national (NUTS3) level analysis to
    identify the 'true' temperature-GDP reaction function, as global optimal temperature
    estimates may not be appropriate for specific regions.
  13: The analysis uses within-country heterogeneity in climate.
  14: The authors caution interpreting the estimated size of the impact of future
    climate change due to model uncertainty; The analysis focuses on the historical
    record and cannot capture potential extreme events outside this range; Future
    research should address model uncertainty, explicitly model adaptation, and develop
    more theory-driven empirical models to better discriminate between growth vs.
    level effects and short- vs. long-run effects; Policy should foster a growth of
    economic activities other than agriculture.
  15: The COSMO-CLM model is used for temperature projections.
  16: The analysis considers both positive and negative deviations from historical
    temperature and precipitation norms. The effect on agricultural GVA per-worker
    growth is several times larger than the effect on GDP per-capita growth.
