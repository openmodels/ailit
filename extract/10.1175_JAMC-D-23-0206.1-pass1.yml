Highlights:
  2: Uses a novel dynamically downscaled convection-permitting simulation to examine
    projected changes in extreme daily precipitation throughout the CONUS during the
    twenty-first century.
  3: No relevant information
  5: "HIST admirably represented the mean and 99th percentile of daily precipitation\
    \ annually and seasonally compared to PRISM. The HIST annual 99th percentile of\
    \ daily precipitation was significantly wetter for a large area of the Intermountain\
    \ West. Signi\uFB01cantly drier areas were mainly con\uFB01ned to the Northeast."
  6: "The largest areas of statistically significant decreases in the 99th percentile\
    \ of daily precipitation were in EOC8.5 in the Southwest (March\u2013May) and\
    \ Intermountain West (June\u2013August). Eastern CONUS showed the highest 99th\
    \ percentile of daily precipitation in the Midwest and Southeast in all seasons.\
    \ Large areas of decrease in the Southeast and Atlantic coast during September\u2013\
    November in EOC4.5 and EOC8.5, but small areas of statistical significance."
  7: "EOC8.5 showed a statistically significant dry bias in HIST for some regions;\
    \ The largest area of increase transitions from the lower Midwest and Ohio Valley\
    \ in December\u2013May to the upper Midwest in September\u2013November."
  8: Statistically significant increases in mean MCS precipitation are found in the
    Northeast into the Appalachian Mountains (June-August), Ohio Valley (December-May),
    and Midwest (March-May and September-November). The 99th percentile of daily precipitation
    displayed large areas of greater than 50% increase by the end of the twenty-first
    century in all seasons except June-August.
  9: The model reasonably estimates extremes at lower magnitudes but tends to underestimate
    at the highest magnitudes in six of the eight cities studied. This underestimation
    is partly attributed to the skewed nature of the upper tail of the distribution
    and the limited amount of input data. There is more underestimation by the model
    when the difference between the largest extreme values is high.
  10: Model tends to underestimate highest magnitude precipitation values. Underestimation
    bias observed for Albany EOC8.5 and Seattle EOC8.5. High correlation (r > 0.9)
    between modeled EVA distributions and input WRF distributions.

    time periods (1990-2005 vs. 2085-2100) and climate scenarios (EOC4.5 and EOC8.5)
    for eight cities.
  14: Shows projected changes in return periods for daily precipitation events under
    different emission scenarios (EOC4.5 and EOC8.5) relative to a historical period

    West, Southwest, and Northeast in the 100-yr return period precipitation value,
    while EOC4.5 displayed only sporadic areas of significant increases.

    end of the twenty-first century for both RCP scenarios in many regions in the
    CONUS, such as the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, and Pacific Northwest.

Methodology:
  1: "Dynamically downscaled, convection-permitting regional climate model to investigate\
    \ extreme daily precipitation in the CONUS, de\uFB01ned explicitly as the 99th\
    \ percentile 24-h accumulated value"
  2: "Uses a dynamically downscaled convection-permitting simulation (WRF-ARW version\
    \ 4.1.2 with 3.75 km horizontal grid spacing) forced by CESM GCM output (CMIP5),\
    \ regridded and bias-corrected using 1981\u20132005 ERA-Interim reanalysis. Spectral\
    \ nudging was used at 6-h intervals to large-scale features."
  3: "Analyzes daily precipitation from the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) total\
    \ simulation precipitation accumulation variable. Compares HIST daily extreme\
    \ precipitation to observations from the Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent\
    \ Slopes Model (PRISM).  Extreme daily precipitation is defined to be the 99th\
    \ percentile of daily precipitation over the entire epoch time series. Implements\
    \ univariate EVA using the Fisher\u2013Tippett\u2013Gnedenko theorem."
  5: Compares HIST and PRISM datasets for the 99th percentile of daily precipitation
    annually and seasonally (December-February, March-May, June-August, September-November)
    from 1990-2005. Uses Pearson's r correlation and RMSE to compare the datasets.
    A Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine statistically significant differences
    (p < 0.05) with a field significance false discovery rate of a 5 0.1.
  6: "Compared HIST (historical data) to potential future climate scenarios (EOC;\
    \ 2085\u20132100) using RCP4.5 (EOC4.5) and RCP8.5 (EOC8.5) to assess future changes\
    \ in extreme precipitation. Seasonal analysis of the 99th percentile of daily\
    \ precipitation.  PRISM data is used but noted to have limitations especially\
    \ in regions with limited station density and radar coverage."
  7: "Mann\u2013Whitney U test determined statistically significant differences (p\
    \ < 0.05) between the epochs with a field significance false discovery rate of\
    \ a = 0.1; Analysis uses HIST (1990-2005), EOC4.5 (2085-2100), and EOC8.5 (2085-2100)\
    \ epochs; The analysis focuses on the 99th percentile of daily precipitation during\
    \ December-February"
  8: Compares historical precipitation data (HIST) with two future climate scenarios
    (EOC4.5 and EOC8.5) for the March-May season, examining changes in MCS precipitation
    and the 99th percentile of daily precipitation.
  9: Extreme value analysis (EVA) is used to model the distribution of extreme events.
    Q-Q plots are used to assess the goodness of fit of the WRF (Weather Research
    and Forecasting model) time series and modeled EVA distributions. Bias in extreme
    value estimation is discussed in the context of dataset size (15 or 30 values).
  10: "The analysis involves comparing modeled EVA (Extreme Value Analysis) precipitation\
    \ distributions to input WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) distributions.\
    \ Model metrics like r, p, RMSE, and R2 are used to evaluate the empirical relationship.\
    \ Q-Q plots are utilized for visual representation of model performance. Results\
    \ are displayed for the September\u2013November period, using a block size of\
    \ 6 months."

    \ values for 1990\u20132005 PRISM (gray) and HIST (black) and 2085\u20132100 EOC4.5\
    \ (orange) and EOC8.5 (red) epochs with a block size of 1 year resulting in 15\
    \ values for eight climatologically unique cities."

    evaluating extremes through probability density functions (PDFs) and return periods
    for precipitation.
  13: Daily precipitation extremes are analyzed using PRISM (1990-2005) and HIST (1990-2005)
    data, and EOC4.5 (2085-2100) and EOC8.5 (2085-2100) climate simulation data for
    eight climatologically unique cities.

    indicate the 95% confidence interval (HIST is shaded) calculated using a 1000-iteration
    bootstrap sample.
  15: The study investigates how extreme daily precipitation may change by comparing
    historical data (1990-2005 PRISM and HIST) with future simulations (2085-2100
    EOC4.5 and EOC8.5) for eight climatologically unique cities.
  16: "A novel convection-permitting dynamically downscaled RCM dataset with two end-of-century\
    \ (2085\u20132100) epochs under pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 is used. The simulated\
    \ historical epoch (1990\u20132005) of extreme daily precipitation is compared\
    \ to an independent dataset of observations (PRISM)."

More Notes:
  1: "HIST (1990\u20132005) admirably represents extreme precipitation climatology\
    \ for most locations in the domain"
  3: 'Focuses on eight climatologically unique CONUS cities for further analysis:
    Albany, New York; Amarillo, Texas; Grand Junction, Colorado; Minneapolis, Minnesota;
    Nashville, Tennessee; Phoenix, Arizona; Seattle, Washington; and Tallahassee,
    Florida.'
  5: "Hatched areas in the fourth column indicate where a Mann\u2013Whitney U test\
    \ determined statistically signi\uFB01cant differences ( p , 0.05) between the\
    \ epochs with a \uFB01eld signi\uFB01cance false discovery rate of a 5 0.1."
  6: "The statistically significant HIST dry bias in the western CONUS for June\u2013\
    August also showed small absolute differences and large negative percent differences\
    \ (i.e., HIST underestimated precipitation). The September\u2013November statistically\
    \ significant dry bias in the Southeast and along the Atlantic coast may be attributed\
    \ to poor model representation of tropical cyclone precipitation. Changes in extreme\
    \ precipitation are linked to implications for regional hydroclimate stability\
    \ and water scarcity."

  9: The analysis focuses on June-August (JJA) data. The WRF model is used as input
    for the EVA. Albany, Tallahassee, Grand Junction, and Seattle are specifically
    mentioned as examples.
  10: The study uses historical (HIST) data and two future climate scenarios (EOC4.5
