Drivers of Risk:
  1: Droughts affected forest dynamics.
  8: Droughts (specifically the 2005 and 2010 droughts)
  11: Drought in 2010 led to loss of biomass and a reduction in carbon uptake in Amazonia,
    impacting forest regions.
  12: Drought events and precipitation anomalies
  16: Repeated droughts, greater extremes in climate including greater dry season
    water deficits.
Highlights:
  1: Pre-2010 droughts did not compound the effects of the 2010 drought
  8: Net biomass change was significantly negative during the 2010 drought census
    interval compared to the long-term mean.
  11: In 2010, the Amazonian forest experienced a reversal of the long-term carbon
    sink trend, becoming carbon neutral due to increased tree mortality and reduced
    productivity.
  12: The 2010 drought led to a widespread reduction in forest productivity (growth)
    in the Amazon. Mortality was also elevated in 2010, but not related to estimated
    precipitation anomalies. No evidence was found that repeated droughts led to an
    enhanced impact. Plots did not gain biomass in 2010, regardless of drought classification.
  16: Amazonian forests appear to have a moderate level of resilience to repeated
    droughts, with fast postdrought returns to net carbon gains; however, the decline
    in productivity in 2010 shows a new response that was not recorded in the previous
    drought.
Methodology:
  1: Examine to what extent the 2010 drought affected forest dynamics using ground-based
    observations of mortality and growth from an extensive forest plot network.
  11: Field measurements and regional scaling were used to estimate biomass changes
    and carbon uptake differences during drought events in the year 2010.
  12: Analysis of tree growth and mortality across the Amazon using forest censuses
    covering the 2010 drought period
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the impact of droughts on Amazon forest biomass.
  16: The extent over which forest responses to drought act is vast, so that they
    have notable carbon cycle implications at regional and global scales.

    longevity of the Amazon carbon sink.
Quantitative material:
  1: "This net biomass impact was driven by an increase in biomass mortality (1.45\
    \ Mg ha\u207B\xB9 yr\u207B\xB9 CI: 0.66, 2.25, p <0.001) and a decline in biomass\
    \ productivity (-0.50 Mg ha\u207B\xB9 yr\u207B\xB9, CI: -0.78, -0.31; p<0.001)."
  8: Net biomass change (2003 to post-2010) was 0.82 (0.04, 1.60 95% CI, n=63).
  11: The Amazon basin was estimated to be carbon neutral during 2010 with a net reduction
    in carbon uptake of approximately 0.47 Pg C yr, of which 30% was due to reduced
    productivity.
