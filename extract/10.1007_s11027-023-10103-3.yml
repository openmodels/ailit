Drivers of Risk:
  6: Climate change impacts such as higher temperatures and extreme events, as well
    as increased climate vulnerability leading to higher cost of debt.
  9: Shocks impacting outcomes include climatic impacts like tropical cyclones and
    increased reliance on imports due to environmental changes.
  10: Climatic impacts translate into risks to adaptive capacity.
  11: Recurring extreme events and declining resources in fragile states may lead
    to adaptive inability.
  13: Climate change impacting adaptive capacity; High exposure of economies in Small
    Island States to climate hazards
Highlights:
  6: Developing countries face disproportionate effects from climate change, impacting
    their economic growth and financial resources.
  11: There is limited reason to assume steady improvements in adaptive capacity due
    to climate impacts, which currently lower adaptive capacity.
  13: Adaptive capacity can be negatively affected by climate change itself; Different
    regions display vastly differing levels of adaptive capacity; Assumptions of adaptive
    capacity in assessments should be tested against available literature on relevant
    climate impacts.
Methodology:
  11: Analysis discusses systemic risks to adaptive capacity without capturing precise
    levels of risks at varying warming levels; suggests need for more fine-grained
    regional analysis.
  13: Review of existing literature on climate impacts and adaptive capacity to test
    assumptions about adaptation feasibility and residual risks; Qualitative consistency
    check for plausibility of adaptive capacity assumptions
More Notes:
  13: Further research is needed to better understand the interactions between climate
    change and adaptive capacity, particularly causal pathways. A consistency check
    for plausibility of adaptive capacity assumptions would add to recent improvements
    in expert elicitation methods.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  6: Negative macroeconomic responses to higher temperatures include decreases in
    aggregate economic output and growth.
  9: Economic impacts mentioned include loss related to tropical cyclone events and
    long-term effects on financial resources.
  10: Reduced adaptive capacity due to negative effects on income or GDP limiting
    financial resources.
  11: Increased cost of borrowing due to decreased adaptive capacity.
  13: Availability of financial resources for economies in Small Island States
