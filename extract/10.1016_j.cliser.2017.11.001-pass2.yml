Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate variability and change increasingly challenging agricultural production.
  2: Damaging climate shocks
Highlights:
  1: "Identifies six factors that have shaped the decision to invest in the SNIA:\
    \ (1) Uruguay\u2019s focus on sustainable agricultural intensi\uFB01cation; (2)\
    \ previous work on climate change adaptation; (3) the modernization of the meteorological\
    \ service; (4) the country\u2019s open data policy; (5) the government\u2019s\
    \ decision to focus the SNIA on near-term (e.g., seasonal) rather than long-term\
    \ climate risk; and (6) the participation of key individuals."
  2: "The government has estimated that economic losses associated with the 2008\u2013\
    2009 drought neared $1 billion USD."
Methodology:
  1: Qualitative research methods, using key documents and 43 interviews.
More Notes:
  1: "The paper investigates the context in which Uruguay\u2019s Ministry of Livestock,\
    \ Agriculture and Fisheries invested in and developed its National System of Agriculture\
    \ Information (SNIA), a national-level climate service for the agriculture sector."
