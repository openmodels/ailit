Drivers of Risk:
  4: Physical deterioration, normal obsolescence, or normal accidental damage of fixed
    assets.
  6: More frequent extreme weather events becoming more normal
  7: Hurricanes (Katrina and Rita)
  8: Floods, storms, fires, droughts, heat waves (US weather and climate disasters)
  10: Billion-dollar weather and climate disasters.
  11: No relevant information
Highlights:
  4: No relevant information
  6: The trend for asset damage from weather and climate disasters should be included
    in consumption of capital
  7: Including full disaster costs in CFC introduces volatility. Including the trend
    is theoretically a proxy for expected costs and avoids volatility.
  8: NOAA and BEA data can be used to estimate asset costs of disasters. NOAA captures
    more types of costs than BEA but doesn't include mortality, morbidity, or indirect
    costs.
  10: Disaster costs are a relatively small but growing portion of NDP.
  11: No relevant information
Methodology:
  4: No relevant information
  6: Proposes a change to how asset damage is accounted for in the System of National
    Accounts (SNA)
  7: The paper proposes including the *trend* of disaster costs in CFC, rather than
    the full disaster costs in the period they occur
  8: "Uses NOAA and BEA data to estimate asset costs of disasters. NOAA data goes\
    \ back to 1980. NOAA chooses individual disasters with costs greater than $1 billion\
    \ (in today\u2019s dollars, CPI deflated) based mainly on government and private\
    \ insurance data extrapolated to cover uninsured claims. BEA mainly includes only\
    \ very big disasters (bigger than 0.1% of GDP)."

More Notes:
  6: The paper argues that the world has changed since SNA08 due to more frequent
    extreme weather events and scientific progress in predicting them.
  8: NOAA data includes non-asset costs; BEA data does not include non-asset costs.
    NOAA data is deflated using the CPI.
  10: The table presents both the costs of disasters and a trend component, suggesting
    an attempt to capture the increasing impact of climate change over time.
  11: This page appears to be notes from a review of a paper, and doesn't contain
    specific information from the paper itself relevant to the specified categories.

Quantitative material:
  4: No relevant information
  7: Quarterly annualised CFC fell by 5.8% in Q2 2005, and rose by 18.9% Q3 (associated
    with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita)
  8: "Individual disasters with costs greater than $1 billion (in today\u2019s dollars,\
    \ CPI deflated); BEA data includes disasters bigger than 0.1% of GDP; Roughly\
    \ speaking asset costs are 2/3 of NOAA, double BEA."
  10: Disaster costs as a percentage of NDP in 1980 (0.12%) and 2023 (0.40%). Disaster
    costs as a percentage of adjusted CFC in 1980 (0.67%) and 2013 (1.95%). NDP, CFC,
    and disaster costs (in billions of dollars) from 1980 to 1985. Additional statistical
