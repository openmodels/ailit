Drivers of Risk:
  3: Global temperature change above pre-industrial levels represented by SSP scenarios
    (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) labeled SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, etc.
  5: Fires, storms, accidents due to human error, major earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,
    tidal waves, exceptionally severe hurricanes, unexpected technological developments.
  6: Extreme weather events becoming more frequent
  8: Floods, storms, fires, droughts, heat waves.
  9: Implied to be climate-related events, but not specified explicitly
  15: Major earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tidal waves, exceptionally severe hurricanes,
    drought and other natural disasters; acts of war, riots and other political events;
    and technological accidents such as major toxic spills or release of radioactive
    particles into the air; abnormal flooding or wind damage; outbreaks of disease;
    forest fires.
Evaluation overview:
  3: Economic activity and its effect on the environment, back onto the economy; also
    global GDP change as an outcome.
  5: Losses of fixed assets.
  6: Asset damage from weather and climate disasters
  8: Asset costs of disasters.
  9: BEA and NOAA costs
  15: Catastrophic losses recorded as changes in the volume of assets.
Highlights:
  3: Variability and uncertainty of economic impacts with different global warming
    scenarios using diverse modeling approaches. The significance of model choice
    and assumptions in predicting future economic outcomes.
  5: Normal accidental damage is included in the 'consumption of fixed capital', while
    losses from infrequent major disasters are not and are recorded separately.
  6: The trend for asset damage from weather and climate disasters should be included
    in consumption of capital rather than Other Changes in the Volume of Assets
  9: Real value increasing over time; volatility of raw data is substantial; result
    is robust to different trend calculation methods
  15: Catastrophic losses are due to identifiable events that destroy a large number
    of assets.
Methodology:
  3: Statistical modeling, Structural modeling, Meta analyses, and AR5 various methods.
    Results are applicable from the 2000s to 2100s.
  5: Distinguishes between normal/expected accidental damage (included in consumption
    of fixed capital) and infrequent major disasters (recorded in the other changes
    in the volume of assets account). Normal obsolescence is included, but unexpected
    technological developments are treated like above-average accidental damage.
  6: Proposal to include asset damage from weather and climate disasters in consumption
    of capital rather than Other Changes in the Volume of Assets
  8: "Uses NOAA and BEA data to estimate asset costs of disasters; NOAA data goes\
    \ back to 1980; NOAA data based mainly on government and private insurance data\
    \ (extrapolated to cover uninsured claims); NOAA chooses individual disasters\
    \ with costs greater than $1 billion (in today\u2019s dollars, CPI deflated);\
    \ BEA mainly includes only very big disasters (bigger than 0.1 % of GDP)."
  15: Identification of large-scale, discrete, and recognizable events that destroy
    a significantly large number of assets within any of the asset categories.
More Notes:
  3: "The image referenced is from the IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report, 2022,\
    \ however the paper in question must contain some analysis and commentary on the\
    \ figure to be relevant."
  4: This page presents a definition of "Consumption of fixed capital" from System
    of National Accounts (SNA08). This definition might be relevant if the review
    considers economic impacts, particularly related to infrastructure or capital
    stock deterioration due to climate change impacts.
  6: The paper argues that extreme weather events are now more frequent ('more normal')
    and likely to become more so, and that scientific progress has made these events
    more predictable.
  8: NOAA data includes non-asset costs, while BEA does not; NOAA data does not include
    mortality or morbidity, nor indirect costs such as downstream business interruption;
    Approximately 2/3 of NOAA costs are capital losses.

Quantitative material:
  3: Percent change in global GDP is on the vertical axis of several graphs.
  8: "Disasters with costs greater than $1 billion (in today\u2019s dollars, CPI deflated);\
    \ bigger than 0.1 % of GDP; Roughly speaking 2/3 of NOAA, double BEA."
