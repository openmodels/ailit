Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Anthropogenic warming, El Ni\xF1o events, Droughts, Fires, CO2 emissions, PM2.5\
    \ emissions, Land-use CO2 emissions."
  2: Severe drought and anthropogenic land-use changes, such as the expansion of oil
    palm plantations on peatlands.
  3: "Changes in the probabilities of drought, fire, and fire emissions at different\
    \ global warming levels (1.5\xBAC, 2.0\xBAC, 3.0\xBAC) are studied, as well as\
    \ the associated impacts of El Ni\xF1o years."
  6: "Anthropogenic climate change leading to changes in precipitation (\u25B3P) and\
    \ increased drought probabilities, El Ni\xF1o events, different Shared Socioeconomic\
    \ Pathway (SSP) scenarios, warming levels (1.5\xB0C, 2.0\xB0C, 3.0\xB0C)."
  13: "Normalized June-November mean precipitation anomalies (\u2206P) are identified\
    \ as a driver influencing fires and fire emissions."
  14: "The Nino 3.4 index (a measure of El Ni\xF1o Southern Oscillation) is identified\
    \ as a factor influencing changes in precipitation (\u2206P) and vertical air\
    \ motion (\u2206\u03C9500)."
Highlights:
  1: "Historical anthropogenic warming increased the chances of droughts exceeding\
    \ 2015 levels in equatorial Asia. Stronger droughts than 2015 are projected with\
    \ 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming scenarios. A 3.0\xB0C warming scenario leads to\
    \ nearly 100% chance of burned area, CO2, and PM2.5 emissions exceeding 2015 levels.\
    \ Future EA climate policy will need to consider the climate change effects on\
    \ fires regarding both mitigation and adaptation aspects."
  2: "The study examines changes in probabilities of drought, fire, and emissions\
    \ in future climate under 1.5\xBAC and 2.0\xBAC warming scenarios."
  3: "The study concludes that as precipitation decreases, the burned area, fire CO2,\
    \ and PM2.5 emissions increase exponentially, highlighting the importance of keeping\
    \ global warming below the 3.0\xBAC threshold to reduce such impacts."
  6: Anthropogenic climate change increases the probability of droughts and fire emissions.  The
    chance of exceeding observed values of drought and fire emissions significantly
    increases with warming, even under the Paris Agreement goals. Future fire CO2
    emissions can have substantial implications for mitigation policies.
  13: "Decreases in precipitation (negative \u2206P) are associated with increased\
    \ burned area and higher CO2 and PM2.5 emissions. The year 2015, marked with a\
    \ red square, appears to be an outlier in at least one relationship."
  14: "The study analyzes the relationships between the Nino 3.4 index, precipitation\
    \ changes (\u2206P), and vertical air motion (\u2206\u03C9500) using climate model\
    \ simulations and observational data. Strong correlations are found between these\
    \ variables, suggesting that El Ni\xF1o events influence precipitation and atmospheric\
    \ circulation patterns in the study region (EA, East Asia, is mentioned in the\
    \ original document before this page)."
  17: Presents probability distributions for several climate-related impacts (burned
    area, emissions) under different warming scenarios.
Methodology:
  1: "Uses large event attribution ensembles of the MIROC5 atmospheric global climate\
    \ model and future climate simulations with prescribed sea surface temperature\
    \ data resembling the 2015 El Ni\xF1o with warming trends to project changes in\
    \ drought and fire emissions; empirical functions relate precipitation, burned\
    \ area, and fire emissions. Results applicable to equatorial Asia."
  2: Probabilistic event attribution (PEA) approach using large ensemble simulations
    to evaluate human influence on the probability of events like the 2015 drought
    and fires.
  3: "The study uses large climate model ensembles to assess the impact of global\
    \ warming scenarios (1.5\xBAC, 2.0\xBAC, and 3.0\xBAC) on drought, fire, and fire\
    \ emissions, focusing on empirical relationships between climate anomalies and\
    \ fire-related emissions."
  6: "Large ensemble simulations (1000 samples) used to estimate probabilities of\
    \ drought exceeding observed values.  Cumulative histograms used to estimate probabilities\
    \ of \u25B3P. 10-90% confidence intervals estimated by resampling. Empirical relationships\
    \ combined with \u25B3P to assess changes in burned area and fire emissions. Uncertainty\
    \ considered by combining randomly resampled \u25B3P and resampled regression\
    \ factors."
  13: The analysis uses empirical relationships between observed precipitation anomalies
    and fire/fire emissions in the EA area during 1997-2016, fitting curves to the
    data using Eq. 1 (not provided here).
  14: The study evaluates the MIROC5 climate model simulations (Hist-long) by comparing
    them with observed precipitation (GPCP) and vertical air motion (ERA-I) data from
    1970 to 2020. The analysis uses normalized time series, scatter plots, and linear
    regression to assess the relationships between variables.
  17: "Uses 1000 random samples of the Nat, Hist, 1.5\xBAC, 2.0\xBAC and 3.0\xBAC\
    \ ensembles to generate cumulative probability functions."
More Notes:
  1: "The paper focuses on the impact of climate change on droughts, fires, and associated\
    \ emissions, particularly in the context of El Ni\xF1o events in equatorial Asia.\
    \ It compares changes in fire CO2 emissions due to climate changes and land-use\
    \ CO2 emission scenarios. The study uses climate models to project future risks\
    \ based on different warming scenarios."
  6: "The analysis focuses on the impact of El Ni\xF1o events on fire emissions. \
    \ The comparison of fire CO2 emissions with SSP scenarios is conservative because\
    \ the SSP scenarios cover a wider area and include other emission sources. Integrated\
    \ assessment models do not currently consider climate change effects on fire CO2\
    \ emissions."
  13: The EA area is not defined on this page. Equation 1, used for fitting the curves,
    is not provided, limiting understanding of the specific functional form used in
    the analysis. The link between the environmental changes and economic/fiscal outcomes
    needs to be developed in order to be policy relevant.
  14: "The study focuses on evaluating climate model performance in simulating precipitation\
    \ and atmospheric circulation patterns, particularly in relation to the El Ni\xF1\
    o-Southern Oscillation. The findings are relevant to understanding climate variability\
    \ and its potential impacts on regional weather patterns. '\u2206P' refers to\
    \ change in precipitation, and '\u2206\u03C9500' refers to change in vertical\
    \ air motion at 500 hPa. The correlations show how well the historical model simulations\
    \ represent observed values."
  17: "The parameter \u0394P is normalized and its meaning is unclear without further\
    \ context. The analysis uses climate ensembles to quantify uncertainty."

  6: "Historical anthropogenic climate change increased the chance of \u25B3P being\
    \ more negative than the observed value from 2% (1-4%) in Nat to 9% (6-14%) in\
    \ Hist. With 1.5\xB0C, 2.0\xB0C and 3.0\xB0C warming, the chance of exceeding\
    \ the observed value of \u25B3P significantly increases to 82% (76-87%), 67% (60-74%),\
    \ and 93% (89-96%), respectively. Historical anthropogenic drying has increased\
    \ the probability of exceeding the observed values of the burned area (from 5%\
    \ (0-18%) to 23% (3-52%)), CO2 emissions (from 5% (0-15%) to 23% (3-47%)), and\
    \ PM2.5 emissions (from 2% (0-5%) to 24% (3-49%)).  Under 1.5\xB0C, 2.0\xB0C and\
    \ 3.0\xB0C warming scenarios, the chances of exceeding the observed values significantly\
    \ increase for burned area (93% (66-99%), 81% (50-95%) and 98% (84-100%), respectively),\
    \ CO2 emissions (92% (72-98%), 81% (55-93%) and 98% (86-100%), respectively),\
    \ and PM2.5 emissions (93% (70-98%), 81% (54-94%) and 98% (85-100%), respectively).\
    \ The chances of exceeding the emissions of SSP1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are 77% (70-84%),\
    \ 34% (28-39%), 13% (10-18%), 37% (31%-41%) and 77% (70-84%), respectively."
