Drivers of Risk:
  1: Interannual hydroclimatic variability (ENSO periodicities), interdecadal variability
    (low-frequency trends and multidecadal oscillations), changes in precipitation,
    river streamflow, and temperature, North and South Atlantic SSTs.
  2: "Droughts, extreme precipitation and temperature events, El Ni\xF1o Southern\
    \ Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV), North Atlantic Oscillation\
    \ (NAO), South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ)"
  8: "Floods in the Paran\xE1 River are highly influenced by interannual variability,\
    \ particularly extreme El Ni\xF1o events. Excess precipitation in the Upper Paran\xE1\
    \ Basin, linked to El Ni\xF1o, is a major driver. A 2.5-year periodicity of precipitation\
    \ rates over NEA also contributes, particularly to lower Paran\xE1 river streamflow\
    \ during high flood events."
  10: Hydroclimate variability and its extremes, intense precipitation events, persistent
    events affecting water supply management, extreme ENSO conditions, decadal-to-multidecadal
    timescales (including trends) affecting precipitation and streamflow variability.
  11: "El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a events; Interannual to multidecadal hydroclimate\
    \ variability; Decadal to multidecadal hydroclimate variability"
  12: Interannual and multidecadal hydrological variability leading to extreme events
    (floods and droughts). Land use changes disrupting natural water and biogeochemical
    cycles.
  13: Hydroclimate variability including frequent pluvial and river floods, severe
    droughts, and increased minimum temperatures are highlighted as drivers of risk
    impacting agriculture and human settlements.
  15: Interannual and multidecadal hydroclimatic variability led to severe droughts
    and floods.

Highlights:
  1: Hydroclimate variability at all timescales had significant sectoral impacts,
    particularly on agriculture, livestock, and hydropower.
  2: Variability modes and their SST forcing factors that influence the formation
    of extreme events. Sectoral impacts of variability at different timescales.
  8: "The largest floods of the Paran\xE1 River occurred during strong El Ni\xF1o\
    \ events, with the 6-year cycle being a large contributor to flood formation."
  10: Northeastern Argentina suffered severe droughts that were more frequent before
    1960 affecting regional economies. Increases in precipitation and streamflow after
    the 1970s and frequent wet extreme events between 1970 and 2005 also observed.
  11: "Interannual variability is associated with flooding during El Ni\xF1o years\
    \ and droughts during La Ni\xF1a events, affecting water management; Interannual\
    \ to multidecadal variability can cause severe hydrological droughts; Decadal\
    \ to multidecadal variability can lead to increased precipitation and flows, frequent\
    \ regional flooding, and extraordinary fluvial floods."
  12: Extreme hydrological events (floods and droughts) driven by interannual and
    multidecadal variability and land use changes have significant economic impacts
    on the agricultural sector.
  13: Severe floods led to infrastructure damage costing USD 450 million, affecting
    energy, transportation, and telecommunication networks in urban areas.
  15: Monitoring multidecadal variability is important for regional decision systems
    in improving planning by water managers and agricultural stakeholders.

Methodology:
  1: Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular spectrum analysis (SSA) were
    used to identify patterns of variability, nonlinear trends, and cycles in hydroclimate
    data.
  2: Examined century-long datasets of precipitation, river flow, air temperature
    and SST using multivariate statistical methods. Explored the relationship between
    leading modes of global SST variability patterns and significant modes of hydroclimatic
    variables. Explored the impacts of hydroclimatic extremes
  8: Analysis uses monthly mean streamflow time series and reconstruction using significant
    modes of interannual and decadal-to-multidecadal variability. Monte Carlo iterations
    are used to estimate significance levels, considering autocorrelation. Time series
    analysis and correlation analysis were performed.
  10: Analysis uses 18-month low-pass-filtered monthly time series, partial reconstructions
    using interannual and low-frequency variability modes, and Pearson correlation
    coefficients to link regional temperature and global SST variability.
  11: Analysis of precipitation variability using principal component analysis (PCA)
    with 120m low-pass filtered monthly mean precipitation anomalies; correlations
    between principal components and precipitation time series at grid points.
  12: Analysis of hydroclimatic variables, streamflow, and sea surface temperatures
    (SSTs) using principal component analysis and correlation analysis to identify
    multidecadal and bidecadal oscillations.

More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on northeastern Argentina and identifies specific hydroclimatic
    drivers and impacts in that region.
  8: "The study identifies a link between ENSO patterns and streamflow in the Paran\xE1\
    \ River, with different periodicities influencing flood events. The lower Paran\xE1\
    \ floods are mainly from excess precipitation in the Upper Paran\xE1 Basin linked\
    \ to extreme El Ni\xF1o events, but local contributions from NEA precipitation\
    \ can intensify the floods."
  12: The study suggests a potential attenuation of flood impacts due to a shift in
    the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.

    hydropower generation capacity was stressed by hydrological droughts; wheat and
    barley yields reduced by increases in minimum temperature.

  10: "Droughts affected navigability of the Paran\xE1 River, leading to complications\
    \ to export grains and transport fuel. Very low levels of the Paran\xE1 and Uruguay\
    \ rivers hindered water extraction for supply, leading to shortages of drinking\
    \ water and pollution problems. Salto Grande hydropower plant on the Uruguay River\
    \ generated only 10% of its energy capacity, impacting on the energetic security\
    \ of Uruguay and Argentina."
  11: Difficulties in water supply, hydroelectric power generation and river navigability;
    Severe hydrological droughts; Frequent regional flooding; Increased groundwater
    levels favored surface runoff; Extraordinary fluvial floods.
  12: Losses in the agricultural sector due to floods (e.g., USD750 million in 1998,
    USD2750 million in 2016) and droughts (e.g., USD8.765 million in 2008-2009 and
    2011-2012).
