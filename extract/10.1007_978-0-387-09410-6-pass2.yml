  205: No relevant information
  215: Aerosols invigorate convection and increase precipitation at a distance of
    about 250 km from the Tropical Cyclone (TC) center, while decreasing convection
    intensity between the remote rain bands and the eye wall; this weakens convection
    within a 250 km radius, preventing intense lightning closer to the TC center.
  217: Continental aerosols penetrating the circulation of tropical cyclones (TCs)

  371: Changes in hurricane risk due to climate change, focusing on the U.S. Atlantic

  372: Climate change impacts are driven by meteorological variables (temperature,
    precipitation, wind, pressure) and are influenced by local factors such as population
    exposure, building norms, and wind speed at the neighborhood scale. Also, the
    shift from agriculture to other economic sectors, improvement in living standards,

Highlights:
  5: Statistical modeling of Atlantic hurricanes indicates a recent upswing in the
    number of strongest hurricanes with little or no multidecadal variation.
  45: Weak but statistically significant correlations exist between water vapor at
    different altitudes and lightning frequency in hurricanes over water.
  75: Caribbean tropical cyclone activity and U.S. hurricane counts have a pronounced
    10-year periodicity with tropical cyclone intensities inversely correlated with
    sunspot number.
  81: The study models tropical cyclone intensity in the western and eastern Atlantic
    basins based on daily sunspot numbers using quantile regression.
  104: Windshear in the Atlantic MDR region is correlated with the MDR SSTs, so that
    as the SSTs increase, the windshear decreases; this relationship may decouple
    in the future.
  107: The paper provides a suite of models for 5-year predictions of US landfalling
    hurricane numbers, along with predictions for the 2007-2011 period based on these
    models.
  108: The predicted number of hurricanes making landfall in the US varies significantly
    depending on the model used, ranging from approximately 1.9 to 2.5 for all hurricanes
    (Cat 1-5) and 0.87 to 1.28 for major hurricanes (Cat 3-5), under a wide range
    of models, for the 2006-2010 time period.
  109: The table presents a range of predictions for hurricane landfalls based on
    different climate and SST/NH prediction models. The Indirect Linear-Trend NH prediction
    model (rows 13, 17) projects the highest number of Cat 1-5 landfalls (2.29) and
    Cat 3-5 landfalls (1.21). The Direct Climate Shift (Low) and SST Climate Shift
    (Low) model (rows 4a, 19a) project the lowest number of Cat 1-5 landfalls (1.30),
    and the Indirect Climate Shift (Low) model projects the lowest number of Cat 3-5
    landfalls (0.42).
  136: The landfall proportion at tropical storm or hurricane strength is slightly
    higher in cold years compared to warm years. For stronger hurricanes (>/= 89 knots),
    the landfall proportion in warm years is smaller than in cold years, and this
    difference is statistically significant for certain genesis sub-regions within
    the North Atlantic basin.
  143: Basinwide, warm SSTs do not have a significant impact on the probability of
    tropical storms becoming hurricanes or strong hurricanes. Regional differences
    exist, with storms forming in the eastern North Atlantic during warm SST years
    having a higher likelihood of becoming strong hurricanes.
  144: The probability patterns for genesis locations of storms becoming strong hurricanes
    differ between all years, warm years, and cold years.
  145: Landfall rates of storms increased during warm SST years, especially for the
    Southeast coast of the U.S. from Florida to Cape Hatteras. Actual values of strong
    landfalling hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 were well above modeled probabilities.
  146: The probability of a hurricane making landfall along the Southeast coast of
    the U.S. increases from 4.5% to 5.5% during warm SST years, although this difference
    is not statistically significant at the 10% level.
  149: The study provides a basis for estimating hurricane landfall risk conditioned
    on a warm SST climate. The results apply to a large number of seasons rather than
    a single one, and are particularly relevant given expectations for the continuation
    of the current warm phase of the North Atlantic SST.
  157: Differences between normalized and raw TC data are most significant in the
    25-30 year band.
  158: Spring snow implies greater numbers of TCs, however the relationship is not
    significant except at long positive and negative lags of about a decade. October
    snow cover extent in Eurasia shows a consistently anti-phase relationship with
    TC, with zero or small lag times, but significant only at decadal periods.
  159: The relationship between Eurasian spring snow cover and TC is similar to that
    of the Northern Hemisphere as a whole in terms of wavelet coherence, but the lag
    coherence had no areas of significance for Eurasia. The sensitivity of TC and
    TC'' on Northern Hemisphere spring snow are shown in figures 7a and 7b respectively.
  166: Network analysis provides insights into correlated hurricane risks across regions.
  172: The U.S. hurricane network shows linkages between regions affected by the same
    hurricane. Hurricanes affecting Florida frequently travel on to affect other non-contiguous
    coastal regions, leading to a high number of links between northeastern Florida
    and the regions of New England.
  178: The ENSO phenomenon has the most significant influence on hurricane activity
    networks.
  186: The Bermuda High influences tropical cyclone paths, and this influence can
    be related to NAO values. The center hollow which the TC travel around, changes
    from a weak horizontal trough during extreme low NAO Index values to a strong
    circular depression during extreme high value, while moving to the northeast.
    There is a higher concentration of tracks in the Western Caribbean and Gulf of
    Mexico.
  205: The presence of large CCN does not influence cloud microstructure in conditions
    of high small CCN concentration.
  215: Aerosols can influence the intensity of landfalling hurricanes by altering
    convection patterns and precipitation distribution, leading to changes in lightning
    activity near the TC center.
  217: Increased aerosol concentrations lead to precipitation over a larger area during
    TC landfall, but with weaker intensity in the TC center. Aerosols increase supercooled
    cloud water and ice (crystals, graupel, hail). Increase of precipitation at the
    TC periphery. Later on, an increase in the aerosol concentration decreases precipitation
    within the TC zone due to the decrease in precipitation rate in the central zone
    of the TC.
  241: Models show a lack of coherence in TC genesis response to future climate change,
    which is associated with different response patterns of SST in the coupled models.
    Most models predict an overall increase of cyclogenesis in the 21st century, except
    for the INGV model. The cyclogenesis response differs according to ocean basins
    and models. The models simulate different characteristics of the ENSO pattern,
    intensity and period.
  245: There is a risk of tropical cyclone development over the Mediterranean Sea
    due to climate change. The spatial and temporal comparison of sea surface temperature
    with intense cyclones shows that sea surface temperature is important but not
    the only important factor as an adequate synoptic setting is also required.
  249: Most models covering the southern Mediterranean Sea show a moderate to strong
    increase in the intensity of extreme cyclones in the scenario run. The spread
    in intensity among the models is much larger for scenario runs than for control
    runs, particularly for the models with a larger detection area.
  250: The REMO model shows a clear increase in cyclone intensity and number with
    higher SSTs in the southern and eastern subdomains, but this is less clear in
    other models due to data limitations.
  263: The paper emphasizes the accuracy of the proposed method for tropical cyclone
    identification even in coarse resolution data.
  291: "The combination of accuracy, stability and computational ef\uFB01ciency make\
    \ the present model a good instrument for applications, like risk analysis, for\
    \ which one must assess tropical cyclone winds under many parameter combinations."
  296: The model predicts a general reduction of TC frequency under increased CO2
    concentrations, with increased rainfall associated with the simulated cyclones,
    particularly in the North West Pacific and North Atlantic.
  300: The study explores the possible effects induced by greenhouse global warming
    on simulated tropical cyclones using idealized experiments with doubled and quadrupled
    atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
  305: The model reproduces well the patterns of TCs genesis, especially in the Northern
    Hemisphere.
  309: "The correlation coefficients suggest negative correlation in ATL and SI regions\
    \ and positive correlation in ENP region between TC frequency and Ni\xF1o3 SST\
    \ anomalies."
  312: Increasing CO2 leads to increased mean surface temperature and total precipitation,
    but a significant reduction in convective precipitation, especially in the tropics.
    Increased CO2 may attenuate high-frequency convective variability, except over
    the equatorial Pacific.
  316: The graphs compare the number of TCs between experiments, latitudes, and time
    intervals (days).
  319: Increased CO2 leads to changes in tropical cyclone precipitation and vertical
    wind shear, affecting cyclone formation.
  326: Simulations show a substantial and significant reduction of the number of generated
    TCs, especially over the North West Pacific and North Atlantic tropical regions,
    despite an increase in their intensity in terms of precipitation; Vertical wind
    shear increases in the ATL region, contributing to TC reduction; TC activity remains
    confined equatorward of 20 degrees latitude.
  335: Model bias in vertical wind shear over the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico may
    affect cyclone genesis.
  338: "The model overestimates the magnitude of Nin\u02DCo3 SST anomaly compared\
    \ to observations. There are discrepancies in the SST anomalies in the equatorial\
    \ Atlantic and the eastern equatorial Indian Ocean in the model compared to observations."
  341: "Model Atlantic TC number tends to increase in model La Ni\xF1a years and be\
    \ below average in El Ni\xF1o years. The same is true for hurricane numbers. There\
    \ is an upward trend in the annual number of model TCs over the North Atlantic.\
    \ El Ni\xF1o years have fewer intense TCs than La Ni\xF1a years in the model."
  368: Total losses increase non-linearly, amplifying the role of the most extreme
    events; adaptation strategies can reduce indirect losses.
  369: Assessment focuses on additional hurricane losses due to climate change and
    emphasizes the difficulties in estimating economic impacts and need for further
    research.
  371: The paper aims to demonstrate a methodology to estimate climate change damages
    rather than to provide new estimates of aggregate climate change damages.
  374: The model predicts an increase in the annual probability of landfall for intense
    hurricanes (category 2-5), with a particularly significant increase for category
    5 hurricanes. Some regions like New Orleans are especially at risk.
  375: The most important information for risk managers is how hurricane risks could
    change. The tables describe the changes to probabilities of hurricanes of different
    categories making landfall.
  376: Physical models require extensive data and are difficult to use for long-term
    exposure projection, especially in developing countries. Statistical models can
    be simpler.
  377: Provides an assessment of local vulnerability parameters for U.S. coastal counties.
  378: Increase in potential intensity leads to a significant increase in the probability
    of the most intense and destructive hurricanes, resulting in much higher direct
    losses.
  380: Uncertainty about future climate is a strong obstacle to the implementation
    of adaptation measures because while the cost of adaptation is immediate, the
    benefits from adaptation measures are uncertain and delayed in the future.
  381: Adaptation measures, such as hard protection infrastructure, can have negative
    side-effects that impact tourism and fisheries revenue, outweighing the benefits
    in some contexts. The paper differentiates between theoretically optimal adaptation
    measures and realistic strategies considering political and economic constraints
    and uncertainties.
  383: The model simulates the reconstruction of the Louisiana economy after Hurricane
    Katrina, predicting an 8% instantaneous production reduction and a reconstruction
    period of about 10 years; model results should be considered indicators of disaster
    seriousness.
  384: Hurricane Katrina resulted in a significant loss of Louisiana's economic output,
    and the model underestimates the observed growth loss due to its inability to
    fully capture the disorganization in New Orleans following the hurricane. Reconstruction
    needs are substantial.
  385: Hurricane Katrina caused a total production loss of $47 billion, and total
    losses (including reconstruction costs) of $154 billion in Louisiana, with an
    Economic Amplification Ratio of 1.44.
  386: Indirect losses grow nonlinearly relative to direct losses, with larger disasters
    causing more significant economic amplification.
  387: Increased hurricane intensity is estimated to double the likelihood of a hurricane
    landfall causing more than $50 billion in damages in the U.S.
  388: Resilient economies with diversified supply chains, rapid infrastructure repair,
    and efficient reconstruction processes can significantly reduce indirect losses
    from climate-related disasters.
  389: Disasters can be opportunities for productivity improvements through the adoption
    of new technologies during reconstruction, potentially limiting capital losses;
    reconstruction should be as fast as possible to avoid losses.
  390: Magnitude of costs associated with extreme-event changes are likely to be large;
    indirect costs are a significant portion of total costs and need to be included
    in cost estimates; decision-makers should not ignore these costs when designing
    responses to climate change; climate change introduces more complexity in all
    decisions related with climate conditions; there is much to be gained by taking
    into account possible future changes in climate and their full economic impacts;
    uncertainty is associated with a cost as infrastructure must be designed much
    more resilient.
Methodology:
  5: Statistical modeling (e.g., Poisson distribution) is presented as a superior
    alternative to simple data analysis (trend lines). Smoothing/filtering hurricane
    count data can introduce low-frequency patterns that may not be significant.
  7: The volume presents empirical analyses, statistical models, and numerical simulations.
    Climate model projections can be downscaled to construct tropical cyclone climatologies,
    combining rejection sampling by numerical models for genesis points with simple
    physical models for storm motion and winds.
  45: Statistical analysis on correlations among 100 hPa, 147 hPa, 215 hPa MLS water
    vapor, and lightning frequency. Averages are calculated over daily 2/C14 /C2 2/C14
    bins during all days of Hurricane Dennis, Emily, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. The
    analysis is performed while storms remain over water only.
  81: The study uses quantile regression to model the conditional quantile of daily
    tropical cyclone intensity as a function of daily sunspot numbers.
  104: Uses a Poisson Generalized Linear Model to provide a combined relationship
    with basin hurricane numbers so that the predictions of windshear and SST can
    be combined. Future changes in windshear and SST from the IPCC ensemble means
    are used, while the current state is estimated from the historical record. Windshear
    estimates are based on climate predictions of Vecchi and Soden [2007] and SST
    estimates are based on predictions from Laepple et al. [2007].
  107: The study develops a suite of models to predict landfalling hurricane numbers,
    considering factors like historical averages, sea surface temperatures, and basin
    hurricanes. The models account for gradual trends and jumps in the climate. Model
    performance is evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE). An expert elicitation
    process is used to weight the models to generate a prediction of future hurricane
    activity. The models are intended to be widely understood by meteorologists, climate
    modelers, and insurance industry practitioners. The results are applicable to
    the 5-year prediction of hurricane numbers.
  108: The analysis uses various statistical models to predict hurricane landfalls
    based on sea surface temperature (SST) predictions and different linking functions
    (linear and logarithmic). Predictions are made for the 2006-2010 period based
    on data up to 2005, using a suite of different linear and non-linear statistical
    models to project hurricane frequency.
  109: The analysis uses a suite of models developed for the 2007 elicitation to predict
    the number of landfalling hurricanes. Predictions are made for the period 2008-2012.
  136: Estimation of landfall probability based on the historical proportion of basin
    TCs making landfall. The probability is estimated by the long-term ratio of hurricane
    landfalls to the number of named storms that developed in the basin over the period
    from 1948 to 2006 under warm and cold SST conditions.
  143: The analysis compares the probabilities of tropical storms becoming hurricanes
    or strong hurricanes in warm SST years versus unconditioned estimates. It also
    examines genesis locations in warm versus cold SST years and calculates probabilities
    based on the climatological values at the genesis locations of specific years.
  145: Statistical analysis of hurricane genesis locations and landfall probabilities
    based on historical data (1948-2006) and warm SST years, using averages for specific
    years and comparisons to climatological values.
  146: Climatological values are estimated at genesis locations and averaged for individual
    years. Bootstrapping is used to assess statistical significance due to small sample
    sizes.
  149: The study uses climatology to estimate landfall risk conditioned on a warm
    sea surface temperature (SST) climate in the North Atlantic. The techniques and
    analyses can be used to study similar aspects of risk in other areas prone to
    tropical cyclones.
  157: Wavelet-Lag Regression Analysis, Wavelet Coherence analysis
  158: Wavelet coherence analysis is used to investigate the relationship between
    snow cover and tropical cyclone (TC) activity using long series of snow cover
    estimates.
  159: Wavelet-Lag Regression Analysis, Wavelet coherence analysis. Applicable to
    studying relationships between time series data like spring snow cover and tropical
    cyclone activity.
  166: Network analysis used to examine relational aspects of hurricane landfalls
    and correlated risks.
  168: Network analysis is used to study hurricanes affecting the United States, treating
    hurricanes as nodes and co-occurrences as links to reveal network structure.
  172: Network analysis of U.S. hurricane impacts on different regions, using incidence
    and adjacency matrices derived from hurricane data from 1851-2005. The R language
    is used for analysis.
  178: Reconstructing networks based on three independent climate factors. Analyzing
    hurricane activity using networks, measuring degree, paths, closeness, betweenness,
    diameter and clustering coefficient. Prediction models of network structure based
    on pre-season climate conditions.
  186: Kernel density analysis of storm tracks (1948-2000 or 1948-2003) to visualize
    incidence and distribution of TCs, hurricanes, and major hurricanes under different
    NAO conditions.
  205: Simulations of aerosol particle (AP) distribution effects on cloud microphysics
    and dynamics with specific hurricane wind conditions considered.
  215: The study uses numerical weather prediction models (NWRP30 and WR) to simulate
    the effects of aerosols on tropical cyclone intensity and lightning activity,
    focusing on analyzing differences in variables like ice content, cloud water content,
    rain content, and vertical velocity.
  217: Uses a 2-D cloud model with spectral bin microphysics and a 3D mesoscale model
    WRF with bulk microphysics to investigate the effects of continental aerosols
    on cloud structure and lightning rate in hurricane clouds. Compares simulations
    with and without warm rain processes to assess aerosol effects on precipitation.
  227: Analysis is based on the CYGP (unspecified what this is) applied to coupled
    GCM simulations prepared for the IPCC AR4. The A2 scenario is used for future
    climate change analysis. Validation for the current climate uses the ECMWF ERA40
    reanalysis dataset.
  241: Analysis of 15 simulations of IPCC AR-4 coupled models using a cyclogenesis
    index (CYGP) based on large-scale environmental factors, including convective
    precipitation. The analysis focuses on the 20th century and scenario A2, looking
    at trends in cyclogenesis response across different ocean basins.
  245: Uses an ensemble of regional climate models nested in the same global climate
    model and the cyclone phase space method from Hart (2003). Analysis based on simulations
    for a high emissions scenario.
  249: "Nine regional climate models (RCMs) were used to simulate cyclone activity.\
    \ The 95th percentile of geostrophic vorticity at the cyclone center was used\
    \ as a measure of extreme intensity. Models were divided into two groups based\
    \ on the southern extension of their detection area (36.5\xB0C or further south,\
    \ vs. up to 39.5\xB0C)."
  250: Analysis involves dividing the Mediterranean Sea into four subdomains and using
    climate models to simulate cyclone frequency and intensity.
  263: The paper describes a method for identifying tropical cyclones using meteorological
    data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) global reanalysis
    project. The proposed method uses horizontal velocity at one pressure level (850[hPa]
    or 1000[hPa]). The accuracy is evaluated against the 'best track' dataset compiled
    by the Japan Meteorological Agency.
  296: The study uses scenario climate simulations carried out with a fully coupled
    high-resolution global general circulation model. The model's ability to reproduce
    TC climatology is assessed by comparing model results from a simulation of the
    20th Century with observations.
  300: Climate scenario simulations were conducted using the SINTEX model (SXG), which
    includes a model of sea-ice. The model's capability to reproduce realistic tropical
    cyclone (TC) activity was assessed by comparing simulations of the 20th century
    with observations. The effects of greenhouse global warming on simulated TCs were
    explored using 30 years of twice-daily data from climate scenario experiments
    (PREIND, 2CO2, and 4CO2). Transition between CO2 concentrations occurred with
    a 1%/year increment.
  305: The paper uses a coupled climate model to simulate TC genesis and compares
    it to observed data from 1970-1999. The model uses an atmospheric component similar
    to Echam4, but with a higher horizontal resolution (T106 vs. T42).
  309: "Correlation analysis between tropical cyclone numbers and Ni\xF1o3 sea surface\
    \ temperature anomalies over specified regions and time periods."
  312: Climate model experiments (PREIND, 2CO2, 4CO2) with analysis of mean surface
    temperature, total precipitation, and convective precipitation over 30-year periods.  Analysis
    also includes computation of the difference in standard deviation of high-pass
    filtered OLR anomalies. Tracking of tropical cyclones is performed with sensitivity
    analysis to the tracking procedure parameters.
  316: The analysis uses experiments (4CO2 and 2CO2) and simulations.
  319: The analysis uses climate model simulations to assess changes in tropical cyclone
    precipitation and vertical wind shear under increased CO2 conditions, applying
    a bootstrap method for statistical significance.
  326: Climate model simulations analyzing changes in tropical cyclone activity under
    increased CO2 concentrations (doubled and quadrupled).
  335: Analysis of the model's ability to simulate tropical cyclones, focusing on
    vertical wind shear and structures of the model TC.
  338: "The paper uses composite maps of observed and modeled SST anomalies averaged\
    \ during August to October for El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a years to compare model\
    \ performance with observations. El Ni\xF1o (La Ni\xF1a) years are defined when\
    \ Nin\u02DCo3 SST anomaly averaged during August to October is more (less) than\
    \ the standard deviation."
  341: The study uses a climate model to simulate tropical cyclones and hurricanes
    and relates their frequency to Nino3 SST anomalies. Regression analysis is used
    to quantify the relationship. Results are applicable to the specific model used
    in the study.
  368: Uses the Emanuel hurricane model to estimate present and future local landfall
    probabilities; Statistical analysis of historical landfalls translates probability
    changes into direct economic losses; A modified Input-Output model investigates
    indirect losses due to macroeconomic mechanisms and feedbacks.
  369: The paper proposes a methodological roadmap focusing on assessing the regional
    impacts of hurricanes in the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coastline, combining climatology,
    engineering, and economy analyses.
  371: The paper follows the causal chain from global climate change to economic damages,
    using socio-economic, emission and climate scenarios to downscale simulations
    of global climate change and translate changes in hurricane risk into changes
    in direct losses and indirect economic impacts.
  372: The paper discusses downscaling techniques to bridge the gap between global
    climate models (GCMs) and local impact assessments. It suggests either downscaling
    socio-economic scenarios or using current socio-economic conditions to assess
    the impact of future climate. Climate change also needs to be downscaled at a
    spatial scale that allows for impact analysis.
  374: "Uses synthetic hurricane tracks (Modi\uFB01ed Climate or MC dataset) based\
    \ on Emanuel (2006) to assess the impact of increased potential hurricane intensity\
    \ on annual landfall probabilities on the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coastline. Compares\
    \ probabilities derived from the HURDAT database, Emanuel\u2019s model in the\
    \ present climate (PC), and Emanuel\u2019s model in a modified climate (MC)."
  375: The analysis moves from hurricane risks expressed in terms of probability to
    direct losses expressed in terms of mean annual direct losses and probability
    of exceeding a given level of losses. The results on hurricane risk changes are
    considered useful for risk managers.
  376: 'Two methods to assess direct losses: (1) physical models based on comprehensive
    datasets of exposure and vulnerability models relating physical disaster descriptions
    to damage ratios; (2) statistical models using past hurricane data and resulting
    direct economic losses to create statistical relationships. Hallegatte (2007a)
    is mentioned using normalized damages proposed by Pielke and Landsea (1998) and
    refined in Pielke et al. (2007), estimating the amount of losses that would result
    if a past hurricane occurred today.'
  377: Estimation of direct losses based on a formula that considers hurricane wind
    speed and county-specific vulnerability parameters; uses a cubed wind speed as
    a proxy for energy dissipated by the hurricane.
  378: Hurricane model to simulate hurricane tracks and estimate direct losses.
  381: Cost-benefit analyses are performed to assess the desirability of new infrastructure,
    considering direct and indirect losses.
  383: Adaptive Regional Input-Output (ARIO) model, a modified IO model based on IO
    tables and a hybrid modelling methodology; dynamic model that takes into account
    changes in production capacity due to productive capital losses and adaptive behaviour
    in disaster aftermaths.
  384: A model is used to simulate the economic impact of Hurricane Katrina on Louisiana,
    including production losses and reconstruction needs, tracking sector-specific
    production over time.
  385: Uses a model that reproduces the reconstruction period to assess the total
    loss in housing service production and sector production. Model limitations include
    inability to capture all indirect losses, the portion of customer demand that
    will be satisfied, and the impact of political choices on the final state of the
    economy.
  386: The analysis involves estimating indirect losses as a nonlinear function of
    direct losses, specifically for Louisiana in the context of Hurricane Katrina.
  387: Indirect losses are assessed using polynomial regression between direct and
    indirect losses from synthetic hurricane tracks.
  389: Methodological roadmap to assess climate change economic impacts, involving
    downscaling climate models, translating local changes into direct losses, considering
    adaptation strategies, and investigating indirect effects (sectoral propagation,
    production losses during reconstruction, macroeconomic feedback).
  390: Series of modelling exercises to assess changes in landfall probabilities,
    direct losses, and indirect losses from hurricanes. Uses one model for each component
    of the analysis. Notes that different models would have found different results.

More Notes:
  7: The page suggests that understanding the factors influencing tropical cyclone
    tracks is crucial for understanding how climate influences local changes in tropical
    cyclone activity.
  45: The page focuses on atmospheric conditions during specific hurricanes and their
    relationships; no direct links to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes are made.
  75: The paper suggests that tropical cyclones can amplify the effect of small changes
    in solar output, leading to appreciable alterations in climate, with serious implications
    for life and property in the Caribbean, Mexico, and portions of the United States.
  76: The focus on U.S. hurricanes and those over the Caribbean is motivated by the
    reliability of records back through the 20th century and by their social and economic
    importance.
  81: The study focuses on the statistical relationship between solar activity and
    tropical cyclone activity. The regression results pertain to predicting the quantile
    of daily cyclone intensity given sunspot numbers.
  104: The paper focuses on predicting the number of hurricanes impacting the US based
    on windshear and SSTs. The economic consequences of these hurricanes are not discussed.
  107: The paper focuses on hurricane prediction methodology rather than direct macroeconomic
    or fiscal impacts of climate change.
  108: The study uses both direct SST predictions and indirect predictions (details
    not provided), and explores different methods for establishing a baseline against
    which to predict future hurricane activity.
  109: The table compares predictions from various models against baseline means calculated
    from historical data (1900-2007, 1948-2007, and 1995-2007). The models incorporate
    different assumptions about climate shifts, SST trends, and the influence of the
    North Atlantic Oscillation (NH).
  136: The sample size for stronger hurricanes (columns B to D in Table 1) is small.
  143: Regional differences in hurricane intensification due to genesis location shifts
    may imply larger impacts on landfalls, which the paper will further explore.
  145: The analysis differentiates between all years (1948-2006) and warm SST years
    only.
  146: Regional shifts in strong hurricane landfall probability are observed, with
    decreases along the Gulf coast and increases in the eastern North Atlantic during
    warm years. Strong hurricane landfalls originating from the eastern Atlantic occur
    almost exclusively during warm years.
  157: The largest region of significance implies that TC determines SSTC (Sea Surface
    Temperature Change) at long lead times (decade or more), which is physically dubious.
  158: The relationship between snow cover and cyclone activity differs between spring
    and autumn.
  166: The focus is on hurricane paths and risk assessment through relational networks,
    not directly on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  178: The work represents a first step toward understanding relational aspects of
    hurricane activity. A next step might be to build prediction models of network
    structure based on pre-season climate conditions.
  186: The analysis is preliminary and focuses on the influence of the Bermuda High
    and NAO on TC tracks, not direct economic impacts. The time period analyzed is
    limited (1948-2000/2003), and the paper does not estimate costs/benefits of adaptation.
  205: No relevant information
  215: The study defines a 'lightning probability' (LP) as the product of cloud water
    content (CWC) and ice mass contents of low and high density ice, using it as an
    indicator of lightning formation potential.
  217: The paper suggests a possible link between anthropogenic aerosol concentrations
    and observed weekly cycles of landfalling TC intensity and precipitation. However,
    this is based on an earlier study (Cerveny and Balling, 1998), and the paper's
    main contribution is to provide numerical justification for this link via aerosol-cloud
    interaction mechanisms.
  227: The paper uses various global climate models (GCMs) from the IPCC AR4 suite,
    including INMcm3_0, GISS_model_e_r, CCMA_cgcm3_1, IPSL_cm4, UKMO_hadcm3, MRI_cgcm2_3_2_a,
    MIROC3_2_medres, BCCR_bcm2_0, CNRM_cm3, GFDL_cm2_0, CSIRO_mk3_0, MPI_echam5, UKMO_hadgem1,
    NCAR_ccsm3_0, INGV_echam4 and ERA40. Table 1 provides characteristics of these
    models, including resolution, number of ocean points, convective precipitation,
    and a calibration coefficient.
  241: Higher resolution models (T106 or above) may produce a different response of
    tropical cyclones to climate change than lower resolution models.
  245: The paper highlights that the existence of a theoretical mechanism for tropical
    cyclone formation over the Mediterranean Sea, along with the observation of partially
    tropical characteristics in some Mediterranean cyclones, lends plausibility to
    the analyzed risk.
  249: The study focuses on the group of five models with a larger Mediterranean domain,
    suggesting the intensity change may be related to cyclones over southern and eastern
    areas of the Mediterranean Sea. The analysis on this page is specific to the Mediterranean
    Sea region and may not be generalizable to other regions.
  250: The study discusses regional differences in cyclone intensity and detection
    across various climate models, highlighting issues with missing data.
  263: The paper focuses on improving the identification of tropical cyclones, which
    is a necessary step for assessing and mitigating the economic risks associated
    with these events, but this page does not establish a direct link to macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes.
  291: "a limitation of the model is that it produces smooth solutions, since it does\
    \ not account for features like rainbands and local convective activity. It is\
    \ the authors\u2019 belief that these features are best represented statistically."
  296: "The action of TCs remains confined to the tropical region and the peak of\
    \ TC number remains equatorward of 20\xB0 latitude in both Hemispheres."
  300: The greenhouse warming scenario is described as an idealized experiment and
    not a realistic forecast of future radiative forcing. The purpose is to emphasize
    and make more evident the response of simulated TCs to greenhouse warming.
  305: The model's higher resolution might explain some improvements in the simulation.
  309: No relevant information
  312: The study uses experiments with doubled and quadrupled CO2 concentrations compared
    to pre-industrial levels to simulate the effects of greenhouse global warming.
    The convective precipitation is the precipitation associated with convective processes
    and produced by the convective parametrization scheme.
  316: The page focuses on simulating and analyzing the latitudinal distribution and
    frequency of tropical cyclones under different experimental conditions (4CO2 and
    2CO2) relative to pre-industrial conditions, but the link to specific macroeconomic
    outcomes or costs/benefits of adaptation is not explicitly provided on this page.
  319: The document is focused on climate variables related to cyclones, not directly
    tied to macroeconomic outcomes as specified.
  326: The model may have deficiencies in reproducing realistic TC intensities.
  335: The model has limitations in simulating the eye wall structure of tropical
    cyclones due to insufficient resolution.
  338: The paper suggests that even with its deficiencies, the model may provide useful
    information for understanding the impact of a strong ENSO on Tropical Cyclone
    frequency (a link to a potential economic impact).
  371: The analysis uses only one model in each component, so uncertainty is discussed
    but not quantified, resulting in only one estimate of the climate change influence
    on hurricane losses. The focus is limited to hurricanes in the U.S. coastline,
    representing only a part of the climate change impacts in this region.
  372: The paper acknowledges the difficulty in predicting social and economic trends.
    It also points out that vulnerability to climate change can change over time,
    particularly in developing countries.
  374: The model might not accurately represent weaker (category 1) hurricanes. The
    study analyzes hurricane landfall probabilities for 11 regions of the U.S. Atlantic
    and Gulf coastline.
  375: The tables are relevant to the insurance industry for assessing insurance premiums
    and capital requirements.
  376: The paper does not consider fatalities and injuries because they are assumed
    to be avoidable in developed countries with efficient warning and evacuation systems.
  377: Losses are assumed to depend on the cubed wind speed, considered a conservative
    relationship compared to other analyses. Data availability problems exist, with
    negative bars indicating counties where no landfalls occurred recently.
  378: The rise in insurance premiums could create local issues of insurance affordability.
  380: Urbanization of an area is hardly reversible.
  381: The paper highlights the importance of considering indirect losses in addition
    to direct losses when assessing the economic impacts of climate change and adaptation
    measures. Urbanization of an area should be valued higher due to the uncertainty
    and flexibility of the decision-making process.
  383: The model assumes the Louisiana economy will eventually return to its pre-storm
    situation; uncertainty in results is very high.
  384: The model does not account for political and practical issues linked to the
    reconstruction of New Orleans.
  385: The model estimates housing service production loss at $19 billion. The production
    loss in the housing services sector and the impact on other sectors are considered
    indirect losses. The model assumes the economy returns to its initial situation,
    which may not be realistic.
  386: The effect of disasters on economic losses varies by location and the specific
    nature of the disaster, affecting different economic sectors.
  389: Adaptation strategies can reduce both direct and indirect losses, but their
    quantitative effects are often difficult to assess. The paper applies the roadmap
    to hurricanes in the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coastline.
  390: The paper acknowledges limitations of using only one model for each component
    of the analysis and suggests that a more comprehensive analysis would use several
    models across a range of possible assumptions to bracket the uncertainty of possible
    results. It highlights the importance of considering potentially pessimistic scenarios
    (like Emanuel's model) when dealing with long-term, irreversible decisions. It
    also discusses the concept of 'no-regret' adaptation strategies.

    landfall for each category (1-5) in 11 regions under present climate and a modified
    climate (MC).
  377: Mean direct losses of 1578 million U.S.$ per landfall and 980 million U.S.$
    per track for the present climate
  378: A 0.10% probability event causes about $55 billion losses in the present climate
    but up to $90 billion in the modified climate (10% increase in potential intensity).
  383: Instantaneous production reduction of 8 percent after the shock; reconstruction
    period of about 10 years.
  384: A loss of 2.8 percent of annual Gross State Product over the last four months
    of 2005; Model estimates a growth loss close to 4.5 percent according to BEA data
    when exogenous growth is removed; Figures depicting Louisiana output variation
    (percentage of pre-Katrina) over 144 months; Figures depicting reconstruction
    needs (US$ billion) over 144 months.
  385: Total production loss (sector production plus housing services) is estimated
    at $47 billion, i.e. 44% of direct losses. Total losses (production loss plus
    the part of production dedicated to reconstruction instead of normal consumption)
    are estimated around $154 billion. The Economic Amplification Ratio (ratio of
    total losses to direct losses) is equal to 1.44.
