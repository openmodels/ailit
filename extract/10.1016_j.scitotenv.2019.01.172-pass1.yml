Drivers of Risk:
  4: The study assesses the association between crop yields and climate, indicating
    climate as a driver of risk.
  7: Yield anomalies are being used as a proxy of climate change impacting agricultural
    output
  9: Climate variability, as assessed through its correlation with Principal Components
    (PCs) of crop yield data.
  11: SSTa (Sea Surface Temperature anomalies), ATa (Air Temperature anomalies), PDSI
    (Palmer Drought Severity Index).
  12: Local climate variability, specifically AT (air temperature), AT-lag, PDSI (Palmer
    Drought Severity Index), and PDSI-lag.
  14: Local climate variability represented by Principal Components (PC1, PC2, PC3)
    for ATa and PDSI (likely temperature and drought indices).

  22: Impacts on maize, rice, sorghum and soybean production.

    shortages of energy and water

Highlights:
  4: The paper aims to identify the relationship between crop yield anomalies and
    climate variations, as well as the joint dependencies between crop yield variability.
  9: Brazil, Peru, South Korea, Argentina, Bolivia, Gambia, and Sri Lanka have many
    large loading values across PCs for more than one crop, indicating greater yield
    volatility related to climate variability. Soybean variability is particularly
    large in North and South America and Middle and Southern African countries. Most
    sorghum-producing countries with high variability are located in the mid-latitudes.
  11: Global yields variability of sorghum and soybean anomalies happen in a limited
    number of co-locations. SSTa, ATa, and PDSI impact maize, rice, sorghum and soybean
    yields.
  12: Air temperature and PDSI, both concurrent and lagged, have varying impacts on
    different crops and regions.
  14: More than half of maize croplands in several countries and rice/sorghum/soybean
    in many countries are impacted by local climate in at least one PC. Crop yield
    variability in major exporters is crucial for major importers.
  17: Extensive sSSTa in the Tropical Pacific Ocean linked to climate variability
    over croplands, specifically sorghum harvesting regions of US and South Africa,
    and soybean harvesting regions of China and Brazil. Crops are significantly correlated
    with ENSO indices.
  22: The paper examines correlations between the principal components of maize, rice,
    sorghum, and soybean yields, identifying both positive and negative relationships.
    Specific correlations (0.37% and -0.41%) are noted.
  23: The study identifies that large-scale climatic patterns and oscillations, including
    ENSO and NAO, strongly correlate with crop yield variability across various regions.
  24: Negative impacts of climate on crop yields in some countries can be modified
    by its positive impacts in other countries; import-dependent countries could trade
    with nations experiencing favorable impacts of climate to improve food security;
    predictability of climatic patterns can be used for food security purposes

    to dangerous climate change.
Methodology:
  4: The analysis uses Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) to decompose yield
    time series of crops from 1961 to 2013 to identify co-varying crop producers and
    dependencies between crops.
  7: RPCA is used because basic PCA methods are unreliable in the presence of outliers.
  9: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to crop yield data. Spearman correlation
    is used to assess the association between climate and PCs in both concurrent and
    one-year lag phases.
  11: Correlation analysis between principal components (PCs) of maize, rice, sorghum,
    and soybean yields, and SSTa, ATa, and PDSI over croplands from 1964 to 2010 (with
    a one-year lag from 1963-2009).
  12: The analysis uses Principal Components (PCs) to analyze the impact of climate
    variability on croplands.
  14: Analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify patterns of local
    climate variability affecting crop yields across different regions and time lags.
  17: Correlation analyses between SSTa/SATa indices and principal components (PCs)
    of climate variables with various lead times, using both annual and seasonal (December-January-February)
    averages. Identification of the ENSO index with the largest correlation magnitude.
  22: Spearman correlation analysis between principal components (PCs) of crop yields.
  23: The analysis is performed by correlating crop yield variabilities of maize,
    rice, sorghum, and soybean with local climatic patterns.
  24: Country-based yield data (FAO, 2016) is used; climate drivers of crop yield
    variability are used for prediction purposes
  37: The Steffen et al. (2011) paper examines coping mechanisms within Australian
    agriculture in the face of climate change.
More Notes:
  9: The analysis focuses on maize, rice, sorghum, and soybean crops. The 'L matrix'
    and 'MRSS' acronyms are used but not explicitly defined on this page.
  11: The study identifies locations with statistically significant correlations (95%)
    over croplands, designates these with small black dots, and highlights countries
    with large positive (negative) loading values in orange (blue). LLVC is not defined
    in the text, nor is MRSS.
  12: The analysis focuses on the top 20 producers of maize, rice, sorghum, and soybean
    in 2013.
  14: The analysis identifies specific major exporter (ME) and major importer (MI)
    countries for maize and rice that co-vary conversely in different PCs, potentially
    indicating vulnerability and dependencies. Figure 5 visualizes the percentages
    of impacted croplands by region, crop, and PC component.
  22: The principal component analysis likely aims to reduce the dimensionality of
    crop yield data and identify key patterns of variation. The correlations between
    PCs then suggest relationships between these underlying patterns across different
    crops, potentially reflecting shared environmental drivers or interactions. The
    paper only shows correlations and does not seem to relate the crop production
    to other economic outcome measures.
  23: The spatial coverage of the croplands is based on data from the year 2000, which
    may limit the applicability of the findings to current conditions.
  24: Study focused only on climate impacts, ignoring other factors like technological
    advances, political issues, social strife, and food security strategies.
No relevant information:
  6: This page focuses on oceanic and atmospheric indices and cropland coverage, not
    on macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, costs, or benefits of adaptation at
    a national level.
  19: This page focuses on climatic patterns and their correlation with crop yields
    (specifically sorghum, soybean, and rice) in North America. It does not directly
    address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, nor does it quantify costs/benefits
    of adaptation at a national level. While changes in crop yields could indirectly
    impact macroeconomic variables, this paper does not make that connection explicit.

Quantitative material:
  9: Uses loadings from the first 3 PCs acquired from the L matrix. Chooses LLVC based
    on one standard deviation exceedance of loadings values from the mean from both
    sides in each PC. Countries are identified if they have large loadings values
    in at least 12, 11, 8, and 10 times across all PCs of MRSS respectively.
  11: LLVC in PC1-PC2-PC3 account for 16%-14%-13%, 4%-8%-10%, 52%-32%-49%, 72% - 41%-35%
    of the global MRSS production. PCs explain about 24%, 25%, 25%, 31% of the global
    maize, rice, sorghum and soybean yield variabilities in the low rank matrix respectively
    from 1964 to 2010.
  12: In PC1 56% of maize harvesting regions in Europe, 40% of sorghum harvesting
    regions in North America and 49% of soybean harvesting regions are impacted.
  14: Percentages of MRSS croplands impacted by local climate in at least one PC (illustrated
    in Figure 5, with bar charts showing values up to 60).
