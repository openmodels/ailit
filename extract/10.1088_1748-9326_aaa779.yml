Drivers of Risk:
  1: The paper implicitly addresses the need to adapt to global demand for agricultural
    products while mitigating environmental impacts. It does not explicitly mention
    shocks or changes, but the context suggests drivers related to climate change
    impacts on agriculture.
  2: Concerns about 'business as usual' including costs of inputs, opportunities lost
    to uniform management approaches, and vulnerability to accelerating environmental
    changes.
  3: Accelerating environmental changes.
  4: Climate extremes, seasonal drought, variable rainfall, insect/weed/pathogen pressures.
  5: Insect, weed, pathogen pressures; erosion; suboptimal soil C storage, low productivity
  6: Altered grass-fire cycle, increasing overgrazing, traditional cheatgrass invasion,
    accelerated erosion
  7: External shocks and perturbations (e.g., weather extremes, invasive species,
    disease outbreaks) can tip the entire system into alternative states.
  10: The study identifies factors like additional capital/labor, lack of information/examples/producer
    experience, need to abandon current approaches, and difficulty in implementation
    as drivers affecting the adoption of these practices.
  13: Climate change.
Evaluation overview:
  1: The paper provides an overview of sustainable intensification of agriculture
    as an outcome being evaluated, aiming to reconcile agricultural production with
    environmental stewardship.

    of agriculture; Enhancing the quality of life for agricultural producers and society.
  4: Practices under investigation include cover crops, precision technologies, tillage
    management, crop diversification, and irrigation management; outcomes relate to
    local concerns about business-as-usual production, such as agrochemical inefficiencies,
    erosion, water quality, limited resilience to climate extremes, nutrient losses,
    suboptimal C storage, and water competition.
  5: No relevant information
  6: Suboptimal forage production and utilization, carbon storage, land use affecting
    Everglades, cheatgrass invasion, shrub dominance, perennial grass loss, drought/aridity,
    localized losses, long term expansion of velvet mesquite, NPP, perennial grasses,
    and biodiversity erosion
  7: No relevant information.
  8: No relevant information
  10: This study evaluates the adoption of various aspirational agricultural practices.
  13: Economic losses due to climate change are greater in rural areas compared to
    urban areas.
Highlights:
  1: The LTAR network and its Common Experiment are introduced as a means to inform
    decision-making by agricultural producers, consumers, and policy-makers regarding
    sustainable intensification.
  2: 'Four general strategies for sustainable intensification: reducing reliance on
    inputs, diversifying management, building adaptive capacity to environmental changes,
    and managing agricultural landscapes for multiple ecosystem services.'
  3: Strategies to advance sustainable intensification include reducing reliance on
    inputs through ecological intensification; diversifying management to match land
    and ecosystem services; building adaptive capacity to accelerating environmental
    changes; managing agricultural landscapes for multiple ecosystem services.
  4: Aspirational treatments aim to address agrochemical inefficiencies, erosion,
    water quality issues, and improve resilience to climate extremes compared to business-as-usual
    approaches (e.g., corn/soybean rotation with aggressive tillage and uniform agrochemical
    application).
  5: No relevant information
  6: Various rangeland management practices are evaluated, including prescribed burning,
    rotational grazing, adaptive management, grass-fed beef production, livestock-landscape
    matching, brush-steppe restoration. Impacts on forage production, carbon storage,
    biodiversity, and erosion are assessed.
  7: No relevant information.
  8: Scientists across the LTAR network share common concerns about business-as-usual
    production, which resolved into three broad themes. Scientists are motivated by
    aspirational outcomes in the environment, economy, and society.
  10: Adoption often lags behind outreach for aspirational practices. Specific barriers
    differ for various practices like cover crops, tillage management, rotational
    grazing, and prescribed burning.
  13: There are information deficits hindering the adoption of grazingland management
    practices.
Methodology:
  1: The paper introduces the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network's Common
    Experiment, where 21 independent but coordinated experiments compare conventional
    production systems with systems hypothesized to advance sustainable intensification.
    The approach is based on a conceptual model of interactions between agriculture,
    economics, society, and the environment.
  2: LTAR network and Common Experiment involve 21 independent but coordinated experiments
    linked by common objectives and measurements across agricultural lands in the
    U.S.
  3: The Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network's Common Experiment is being
    conducted in croplands, rangelands, pasturelands, and grazed croplands across
    the United States.
  4: The study uses experimental research at multiple locations (MO, WA, OH, MI, MD,
    MS, NE) in different MAP zones, comparing 'business-as-usual' agricultural treatments
    with more sustainable or aspirational treatments. Aspirational treatments include
    cover crops, precision technologies, and diversified crop rotations.
  5: No relevant information
  6: 'Experiments conducted at various locations: Archbold Biological Station/University
    of Florida, Central Plains Experimental Range, Great Basin, Jornada Experimental
    Range, Southern Plains (b) Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed'
  7: Survey designed using a conceptual model, with a comprehensive census approach
    surveying all network sites.
  8: Qualitative survey data coded using descriptive and thematic coding methods;
    ordination of experiments based on tabulated data; analysis of survey results
    via in-person and virtual meetings; categorization of concerns and aspirational
    outcomes into broader themes; categorization of practices into practice types.
    The aspirational questionnaire was administered January-February 2017.
  10: The analysis is based on ratings submitted via the Aspirations Questionnaire.
    Summary statistics are available in supplement 6, and methods are detailed in
    supplement 5. The study identifies broader themes through a synthesis process
    shown in figure 2.
  13: Scenario modeling is used to improve understanding of trade-offs among environmental,
    economic, and social effects of management under different scenarios, knowledge
    identified as critical during the synthesis process.
More Notes:
  2: Barriers to adoption include informational, economic, and social factors; LTAR
    is exploring financial mechanisms and collaborative capacity to overcome these
    barriers.
  3: Practices for cropland management include cover crops, drainage management, irrigation
    management, precision technologies, and tillage management. Practices for grazingland
    management include graze-animal groups, increased biodiversity, livestock-livestock
    matching, prescribed burning, and rangeland restoration. Practices for enterprise
    management include feed production, integrated pest management, manure management,
    managed pest management, and crop rotation.
  4: The study appears to be an experimental investigation of different agricultural
    management practices and their effects on various environmental and productivity
    outcomes.
  5: Varied agricultural practices including cover crops, manure management, and tillage
    management are discussed, primarily in the context of sustainability and risk
    management in different climatic zones.
  6: Includes location information (lat/long) for experimental sites in FL, CO, ID,
    NM, OK, and AZ.
  7: The analysis discusses feedback loops affecting agricultural production systems,
    involving profitability, environmental effects, societal factors, and policies.
  8: Focus is on sustainable intensification and adoption of agricultural practices.
    Supplements contain more detailed information.
  10: The study categorizes practices into Cropland management, Grazingland management,
    and Enterprise management. The size of data points in Figure 5 reflects the number
    of experiments conducted for each practice. The paper uses Figure 5 and Figure
    6 to visually represent the barriers and rating of outreach/adoption.
