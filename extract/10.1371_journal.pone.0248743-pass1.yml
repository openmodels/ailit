Drivers of Risk:
  1: Carbon emissions, unemployment, rainfall, temperature, inflation, and population
    are identified as drivers affecting economic growth.
  2: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, unemployment,
    fluctuating oil prices, and external shocks affecting oil exports.
  3: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, population
  4: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature are drivers of risk related to climate
    change.
  5: Variability in climate conditions such as temperature and rainfall, as well as
    CO2 emissions, are identified as impacting economic growth.
  6: Carbon dioxide emissions (CO2), Rainfall (RF), Temperature (TEPT), Inflation
    (INF), Population (POPL), Unemployment (UNEMP)
  7: Carbon emissions (CO2), rainfall (RF), temperature (TEPT), inflation (INF), population
    (POPL), unemployment (UNEMP)

    Reliance on cheaper foreign workers, long-term unemployment compensation, and
    social support provided to local unemployed workforce. Natural resources (petroleum,
    natural gas, gold, copper, and iron ore) for countries like Saudi Arabia.
  13: Carbon emissions (CO2), rainfall (RF), temperature (TEPT)
  14: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, unemployment
  15: Environmental and macroeconomic transformations impacting Saudi Arabia. The
    analysis considers exogenous shocks of independent variables (carbon emissions,
    rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, unemployment) on economic growth.
  16: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, unemployment,
    copper coupled
  17: Climate change (variations in rainfall and temperature), over-reliance on foreign
    labor, fossil fuel scarcity, geopolitical circumstances, technological advancements,
    global circumstances.
Highlights:
  1: Unemployment is positively integrated with economic growth; carbon emissions
    negatively affect growth; rainfall and temperature have mixed effects; long-term
    inflation and population effects are positive.
  2: Saudi Arabia can achieve both higher economic growth and lower carbon emissions
    simultaneously even without effectively addressing the unemployment problem. The
    nation should utilize modern scientific technologies to reduce annual rainfall
    losses and to reduce annual temperature in some parts of the country in order
    to achieve higher economic growth.
  3: The study investigates the effects of environmental and macroeconomic variables
    on economic growth in Saudi Arabia, addressing a gap in the literature. It aims
    to inform policy shifts to diversify growth sources and avoid global shocks, contributing
    to Vision 2030.
  4: No precise consensus on the effects of various environmental and macroeconomic
    variables on economic growth has yet been reached.
  5: The influence of climate change variability on economic growth remains inconclusive,
    with differing effects across tropical areas and climate zones.
  6: Variables are integrated in a mixed order of I(0) and I(1), necessitating the
    use of ARDL bounds testing for cointegration.
  9: The F-statistic value of 12.38 is considered large enough to reject the null
    hypothesis of no cointegration, suggesting a long-run relationship among the variables.
  10: "Unemployment, population, rainfall, temperature, and CO2 emissions significantly\
    \ impact Saudi Arabia\u2019s GDP growth in the long run."
  11: Higher annual rainfall and higher per capita CO2 emissions have a significant
    negative effect on GDP growth in Saudi Arabia. Unemployment rate and average temperature
    have a significant but positive effect on the country's GDP.
  12: GDP growth of Saudi Arabia is affected by both endogenous and exogenous factors.
    A positive relationship between GDP growth and unemployment rate is possible in
    the long run when economic growth is affected by both endogenous and exogenous
    factors. GDP growth and population growth are significantly and positively cointegrated
    in the long run for Saudi Arabia.
  13: Lagged GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, lagged rainfall, temperature, lagged
    temperature, and lagged carbon emissions have statistically significant impacts
    on economic growth in the short run. The ECM coefficient indicates a significant
    adjustment towards long-run equilibrium.
  14: The coefficients are suitable for the dependent variable to predict the future
    if the CUSUM and CUSUM of Squares lines are inside the 5% significance boundaries;
    Residual variance is fairly stable, as the CUSUM of squares is within the 5% level
    of significance.
  15: No significant impact detected from individual exogenous shocks of independent
    variables on the dependent variable (GDPG) during the study period based on impulse
    response functions. Saudi Arabia can achieve higher economic growth without addressing
    the nation's unemployment problem given its reliance on foreign workforce and
    welfare provision to citizens. Rainfall, temperature, and population show indecisive
    responses to economic growth.
  16: Saudi Arabia should reduce carbon emissions to promote economic growth; environmentally
    friendly renewables would help achieve sustained economic growth; modern scientific
    technologies should be utilized to curtail the adverse effects of annual rainfall
    and temperature. Addressing the nation's unemployment problem is not strictly
    necessary for achieving economic growth.
  17: Climate change poses a significant threat to Saudi Arabia's long-term economic
    growth due to its arid climate. Adaptation to climate change is crucial for long-term
    economic growth. Diversifying the economy away from petroleum and embracing green
    energy is essential for sustainable economic growth. Unemployment among Saudi
    citizens can lead to social and political instability.

    role in sustainable economic development. Empirical evidence supporting the argument

    at the country level.
  3: The study uses time-series data from 1990 to 2019 for Saudi Arabia. It aims to

    transformations on its economic growth using an ARDL bounds testing approach to
    determine short- and long-run relationships. The Cobb-Douglas function is used.
  7: The study employs the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach
    to cointegration to determine long-run relationships between the variables. This
    approach is suitable because the data series have a different order of integration.
  9: A bound F-statistic (bound test for cointegration) is computed to determine the
    existence of long-run cointegrating relationships among the variables. VAR in
    polynomial graph is also used, where lags are selected based on certain criteria.

  15: Uses the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach to cointegration,
    impulse response functions (IRF), and variance decomposition using Cholesky factors
    to analyze time series data from 1990 to 2019. Impulse response functions check
    the exogenous shock of each independent variable to the dependent variable. Variance
    decomposition checks how external shocks resonate through an economic system.

    relationships among the listed variables and to propose policy measures to achieve
    Vision 2030 goals in Saudi Arabia.
  5: The paper mentions mixed findings in empirical literature regarding the relationship
    between temperature variability and economic growth.
  6: Data are collected for the period 1990-2019. Rainfall and temperature data are
    from the General Authority of Meteorology and Environmental Protection, Kingdom
    of Saudi Arabia. Other data are from the World Bank.
  7: The paper mentions that the ARDL approach minimizes extreme outliers, making
    the measures and inferences reliable and robust. Descriptive statistics are presented
    in Table 3, assessing skewness, kurtosis, and normality of the data.

    finding in the context of Saudi Arabia's economy.
  12: Macroeconomic policy effectiveness remains questionable in Saudi Arabia. The
    relationship between temperature and GDP growth differs across tropical areas

    or instability issues, and the data is normally distributed.
  14: Figures 3 and 4 present the CUSUM and CUSUM of squares tests, respectively.
  15: The study investigates the effects of environmental and macroeconomic transformations
    on Saudi Arabia's economic growth. The variance decomposition suggests that carbon
    emissions, unemployment, and inflation have responded relatively well to economic
    growth, which demonstrated a descending trend. The provided DOI link is likely
    to lead to the full paper.
