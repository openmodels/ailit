Highlights:
  1: Cereal import dependency constraints have a larger impact on cereal consumption
    than climate change impacts on agricultural yields. Climate change results in
    rising domestic prices and declining consumption of cereal crops. The effects
    of trade perturbations and climate change vary greatly across regions.
  3: No relevant information
  5: A major highlight is the significant reduction in global cereal trade under constrained
    import dependency scenarios, while climate change's impact on trade quantity is
    comparatively small.
  6: Climate change causes increased land allocation to cereal crops due to negative
    impacts on yields.
  8: Climate change can influence production and consumption changes, but the impact
    of trade perturbations is generally larger, with the USA being an exception. The
    impact of trade constraints and climate change on cereal consumption in the USA
    is approximately additive. Regions with higher CIDR in RF are likely to have larger
    reductions in cereal consumption and increases in cereal production in ID.
  9: Under global zero cereal import dependency (ID), regions with RF CIDR < 0% (USA,
    Brazil) experience increased production. Regions with RF CIDR > 0% see production
    expanding into more costly land, increasing prices. Regions not dependent on cereal
    imports in RF have lower production and contraction of land in ID, resulting in
    reduced prices.
  10: Climate change increases corn prices more than import dependency reduces them
    in the USA and Brazil, but the reverse is true for Western Africa and the Middle
    East.
  11: Cereal production is projected to decrease, leading to changes in trade patterns
    and revenue. Irrigation water consumption for cereals is projected to decrease,
    while consumption for non-cereals may increase. Corn consumption for ethanol is
    affected by the scenarios.
  12: Key findings include significant changes in cereal and non-cereal production,
    consumption, and trade in the Middle East under climate change and trade constraint
    scenarios; Specifically a large drop in cereal imports to the middle east (-78.6%)
    and a large change in exports of cereals (2599%). Also, a large increase in Middle
    Eastern non-cereal imports to offset cereal import reductions is predicted.
  14: Constrained cereal trade leads to decreased cereal consumption and increased
    non-cereal consumption in the USA and Brazil. In the Middle East, international
    trade can mitigate some negative climate change impacts on crop yields. Corn ethanol
    production decreases significantly in the Middle East under trade constraints
    due to regional scarcity of cereal crops and more elastic demand for ethanol than
    food. In the USA, a major corn exporter, corn ethanol becomes more competitive
    domestically under trade constraints due to decreased global demand for corn.
  15: Import dependency constraints have a larger impact than climate change on cereal
    production and consumption overall, but climate change has an important role in
    some regions, such as the USA. Reducing import dependence reduces sensitivity
    to international supply chain fluctuations but increases susceptibility to domestic
    shocks. Climate change and import dependency can slightly amplify each other in
    some cases.
Methodology:
  1: 'Introduces systematic perturbations in two dimensions: agricultural trade restrictions
    and climate impacts on crop yields. Explores these independently and in combination
    using long-term projections. Uses a globally coupled agricultural-bioenergy-water
    systems model.'
  3: Uses GCAM version 5.3 model to perform a global-scale integrated assessment of
    trade and climate impacts, with results from 1975 to 2100.
  5: 'The analysis explores four model scenarios using the GCAM model: Reference,
    Import Dependency, Climate Change, and Import Dependency under Climate Change,
    with outputs in 5-year increments until 2050.'
  6: Uses a global modeling framework (GCAM) to assess the agriculture, bioenergy,
    and water implications of constrained cereal trade and climate change impacts,
    with a base year of 2015, projecting to 2050.
  8: The analysis compares changes in cereal trade (import/export) in 2050 under different
    scenarios (ID, RF, CC, IC) using a model. The figure shows the top 7 affected
    regions in terms of cereal trade changes. Changes in domestic cereal production
    and consumption are related to the RF CIDR value. Effects are non-linear and influenced
    by factors like land availability, agricultural productivity, substitution possibilities,
    and income levels.
  9: Comparison of scenarios (ID, CC, IC) to a reference scenario (RF) in 2050. Bubble
    size indicates cereal import dependency ratio (CIDR) in RF 2050 deviating from
    0%.
  10: A computational model is used to simulate the impacts of constrained cereal
    trade and climate change on agriculture, bioenergy, and water resources. Analysis
    is performed for the period 2015-2050 in 5-year time steps.
  11: The analysis uses a model (likely GCAM, based on the text, although this specific
    page does not mention that acronym) to project outcomes for 2050 under different
    scenarios related to cereal trade constraints and climate change impacts. The
    results are applicable to the USA.
  12: The analysis uses a model to simulate agricultural outcomes under different
    scenarios (RF, ID, CC, IC) in 2050 for the Middle East.
  14: The analysis evaluates individual and combined impacts of climate change and
    constrained trade on multiple sectoral outcomes through 2050, using one realization
    of climate change impacts on crop yields and one alternative trade perturbation
    scenario.
  15: The study uses modeling to systematically alter trade patterns and climate and
    assess their impacts. Climate change impacts used are long-term averages of climate
    impacts on crop yields under a single climate model.
  16: Uses figures and tables; Conceptualization, formal analysis, funding acquisition,
    investigation, methodology, project administration, resources, software, supervision,
    validation, visualization, writing original draft, writing review & editing.

    between various regions. The thickness of the chords suggests the extent of change
    in trade.
  9: The y-axis scale in the CC scenario plot is smaller than in the ID and IC plots.
  10: The cereal domestic production credit is modeled as a subsidy to the producers
    to increase production sufficiently to meet domestic demand.
  12: The table focuses on the Middle East region and the year 2050. The scenarios
    include a reference case (RF), climate change (CC), and trade constraints (IC).
    The "Staples" category includes cereals as well as roots and tubers.
  15: The study does not evaluate the effects on ecosystems. Results depend on the
    extent to which countries act to reduce import dependency to combat uncertainty
    from supply chain disruptions and the local effects of climate change. The climate
    change impacts used represent long-term averages, while inter-annual variability
    and weather shocks are likely to have sharper impacts on regional production.

Quantitative material:
  1: Global trade of cereals decreases ~50% in 2050 compared to the baseline under
    zero import dependency ratio; global irrigation water consumption increases 3%
    and corn ethanol production decreases 7% in 2050; cereal production and consumption
    decrease 4% under zero import dependency ratio.
  3: No relevant information
  5: "Cereal import dependency changes between 2015 and 2050 are within \xB114 percentage\
    \ points for all regions except Brazil and Australia_NZ; under certain scenarios,\
    \ global cereal trade could decrease significantly, with specific projections\
    \ showing global total cereal imports decreasing to nearly half in impacted scenarios."
  6: The import dependency constraint decreases global land allocated to cereal crops
    by 3.6% on average.
  8: 'Examples include: Australia_NZ: production -50%, consumption +100%; USA: production
    -12%, consumption +9% in ID scenario; USA in CC scenario: production -10.6%, consumption
    -9.0%; USA in IC scenario: Consumption -1.8%.'
  9: Percent change of domestic cereal production versus percent change of domestic
    cereal consumption.
  10: The regional price of corn is higher for these four regions in CC than RF and
    in IC than ID (Fig 5). USA and Brazil show a slight decrease in regional prices
    in ID compared to RF (Fig 5). Western Africa, with RF CIDR of 24%, shows a slight
    increase in the regional prices, while the Middle East, with RF CIDR of 59%, shows
    a larger increase in regional prices than Western Africa.
  11: The table provides quantitative information on changes in import dependency
    ratio, production, consumption, exports, imports, net trade revenue, crop producer's
    revenue, caloric consumption, food expenditures, irrigation water consumption,
    and ethanol production, expressed as absolute values and percentage changes from
    a reference case (RF) in 2050.
  12: "The table presents quantitative data for various key variables in 2050, including\
    \ production, consumption, exports, imports, net trade revenue, crop producers\u2019\
    \ revenue, caloric consumption, irrigation water consumption, and ethanol production,\
    \ with percent changes compared to the reference case (RF)."
  14: The study reports that climate change results in a -14% change in corn ethanol
    production in the Middle East and a -18% change in the USA. Under constrained
    trade scenarios, corn ethanol production decreases by 96% in the Middle East but
    increases by 11% in the USA.
  15: Global trade quantity of cereals decreases to almost half of the baseline under
    global zero cereal import dependency; irrigation water consumption in the Middle
    East increases by 21% and 0.7% under import dependency and climate change (CC)
    individually, but 22% under both.
