Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on crop yields
  2: Shocks affecting outcomes include climate change impacts on crop yields, changes
    in international trade patterns due to strategies such as zero cereal import dependency,
    and global market participation.
  3: The paper explores the impact of constrained cereal trade and climate change
    impacts. Specifically, it uses a zero cereal import dependency constraint as a
    thought experiment to explore the impact of global trade restrictions on multi-sector
    outcomes.
  5: Global zero cereal import dependency and climate change impacts on crop yields.
  6: Climate change impacts cereal yields and global cereal consumption.
  7: Constrained cereal trade, climate change impacts.
  8: Climate change impacts on crop production, trade perturbations (constrained cereal
    trade).
  10: Import dependency constraint impacts regional corn prices with varying effects
    based on regional cereal import dependency ratios (CIDR).
  11: Constrained cereal trade, climate change impacts.
  12: Climate change (CC) and constrained cereal trade (IC) are the drivers of risk,
    compared to a reference scenario (RF).
  13: Climate change impacts on crop yields and constrained cereal trade (import dependency)
    are key drivers.
  14: Climate change impacts on crop yields, constraints on cereal trade (import dependency).
  15: Constrained cereal trade (global zero cereal import dependency) and climate
    change impacts on crop yields. Domestic shocks such as drought or floods. Fluctuations
    in biofuel production.

Highlights:
  1: Most regions experience larger changes in cereal consumption due to cereal import
    dependency constraints than due to the impacts of climate change on agricultural
    yields.
  2: Decreased participation in global markets leads to decreased total cereal production
    and consumption globally. The impact on production and consumption from reduced
    international trade is stronger than that from climate change in most regions.
  5: Imposing global zero cereal import dependency significantly decreases cereal
    trade but has a relatively small impact on total cereal production and consumption.
    Climate change impacts have a small impact on total cereal import quantity compared
    to the zero import dependency constraint.
  6: Climate change and import dependency constraints negatively impact global cereal
    consumption, with their combined effect being roughly additive.
  7: Regions heavily reliant on cereal imports (Middle East, Western Africa) experience
    the largest decrease in cereal imports under trade restriction scenarios (ID and
    IC), and major cereal exporters (USA, Brazil, Argentina, Australia_NZ) experience
    the largest decrease in cereal exports; Cereal importers in RF will have to increase
    cereal production in ID, leading to a price increase and consumption decrease.
  8: Trade perturbations generally have a larger impact than climate change on production
    and consumption changes, with the USA being an exception. Regions with higher
    CIDR in RF are likely to have a larger reduction in cereal consumption and a greater
    increase in cereal production in ID.
  10: Middle East and Western Africa see larger price increases post-2030, influenced
    by import dependency and climate change impacts.
  11: Under combined climate change and trade constraint scenarios, the USA experiences
    significant decreases in cereal production (-20.4%), exports (-80.8%), and net
    trade revenue (-94.6%), along with decreases in crop producer revenue (-19.3%).
  12: Constrained cereal trade significantly reduces cereal imports and consumption
    in the Middle East, leading to increased imports of non-cereal crops. Climate
    change can increase yields for non-cereal crops in the Middle East, leading to
    an increase in production and consumption and a decrease in imports. Trade perturbations
    tend to dominate in the Middle East with production, consumption, and trade changes
    for non-cereals resembling those in the constrained cereal trade scenario.
  13: Constrained cereal trade and climate change can significantly impact trade revenue,
    producer revenues, consumer food expenditure, and water consumption, with the
    direction and magnitude of impacts varying by region depending on trade status
    (importer/exporter) and climate change effects on crop yields.
  14: Climate change and trade restrictions significantly impact cereal and non-cereal
    crop consumption, irrigation water consumption, and corn ethanol production differently
    across regions (USA, Brazil, Middle East). Trade restrictions exacerbate negative
    climate impacts in the Middle East, particularly on corn ethanol production, while
    having contrasting effects in the USA due to its position as a major corn exporter.
  15: Reducing import dependence can lower the risk of supply chain disruptions but
    increases susceptibility to domestic shocks. Climate change and import dependency
    constraints can amplify each other in some cases. Climate change has an important
    role in some regions such as the USA.

Methodology:
  1: Introduce systematic perturbations in two dimensions (agricultural trade restrictions
    and climate impacts on crop yields) and explore these independently and in combination
    using long-term projections.
  2: Analysis is performed using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM v5.3), a global
    integrated model of socioeconomic, energy, land, and water systems, looking at
    interactions between systems over 2015-2050.
  3: The study uses a modified version of the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM
    v5.3), which is a global-scale integrated assessment model. It simulates economic
    decisions and interactions between multiple systems, including agriculture, bioenergy,
    water, and the economy. The model is a market equilibrium model that solves for
    prices where supply equals demand across 32 geopolitical regions and 235 water
    basins.
  5: The study uses the GCAM (Global Change Assessment Model) to explore the multi-sector
    dynamics of agriculture, bioenergy, and water systems under trade constraints
    and climate change impacts. The model solves for all periods and scenarios to
    ensure supply and demand are equal.
  7: Model scenarios projecting cereal trade, production, consumption, and land allocation
    from 2015-2050 under different conditions (RF, ID, CC, IC).
  8: Model-based scenario analysis comparing Reference (RF) and Impact (ID) scenarios
    in 2050. CIDR (cereal import demand reduction) is a key variable.
  10: Scenario analysis comparing regional corn prices under different constraints
    and impacts of climate change, using subsidies for domestic production modeling.
  11: 'The analysis uses the GCAM model and provides results for the USA under different
    scenarios: RF (Reference), ID (constrained cereal trade), CC (climate change impacts),
    and IC (constrained cereal trade and climate change impacts) for the year 2050.'
  12: The paper uses a model to simulate the impacts of constrained cereal trade and
    climate change on agriculture, bioenergy, and water in the Middle East. The results
    are applicable to the year 2050.
  13: The paper uses scenario analysis (ID, CC, and IC) to assess the combined effects
    of climate change and trade perturbations on agricultural, bioenergy, and water
    implications. The results are applicable to understanding the potential impacts
    of these drivers on different regions (USA, Middle East) depending on their status
    as net importers or exporters and the expected changes in crop yields.
  14: Evaluates individual and combined impacts of climate change and trade constraints
    on sectoral outcomes through 2050, using a global cereal import dependency constraint
    and one realization of climate change impacts on crop yields.

More Notes:
  1: The study analyzes agriculture, bioenergy, and water implications.
  3: The model considers land use for competing purposes and price-induced intensification,
    such as irrigation. It also models international trade for agricultural commodities
    among the 32 geopolitical regions, with regionally differentiated markets and
    Armington-style preferences for domestic and imported commodities.
  5: The paper considers the global zero cereal import dependency constraint as a
    thought experiment.
  6: The paper uses a model (GCAM) with a base year of 2015 to project the impact
    on global cereal consumption in 2050.
  7: Figure 2 shows global trends in cereal imports, consumption, and land allocation
    from 2015 to 2050 under four model scenarios (RF, ID, CC, IC).
  8: The effects of climate change and trade perturbations are not linear and are
    influenced by factors such as land availability, agricultural productivity, ability
    to substitute cereals for other food commodities, and income levels.
  11: Staples include cereals, roots, and tubers.
  13: RF is a reference scenario against which the other scenarios are measured. It's
    crucial to note that the results presented are scenario-dependent and highlight
    the potential range of impacts based on specific assumptions about climate change
    and trade policies.
  14: The analysis explores outcomes across multiple sectors under climate change
    and trade constraints, rather than predicting future impacts or trade patterns.
    The results are specific to the yield impacts and trade constraint scenario used,
    and magnitudes may differ under alternate scenarios. Yield changes used in this
    study have been applied in other studies [17, 33, 34].
  15: The study acknowledges limitations in modeling real-world complexities, such
    as varying degrees of import dependency and the effects of inter-annual weather
    variability, which may affect the relative impacts of supply chain disruptions
    versus domestic production losses. Ecosystem effects, carbon storage, net emissions,
    biodiversity, and effects on industries involved in agricultural inputs were not
    evaluated directly, but could be of interest.

    the USA and Brazil. In the Middle East, the change in irrigation water consumption
    due to climate change is smaller with international trade mitigating negative
    impacts on crop yields. Corn ethanol production decreases in the Middle East and
    USA under climate change; trade restrictions (ID) lead to a large decrease in
    the Middle East and a small increase in the USA.

    in 2050 under different scenarios (RF, CC, IC) for the Middle East, including
    percentage changes compared to the reference scenario (RF).
  13: The USA experiences a roughly 50% loss in total crop export revenue relative
    to a reference scenario (RF) in one scenario (ID). In another scenario (CC), the
    total crop export loss for the USA is roughly 30%. In another scenario (IC) loss
    in trade revenue of nearly 75% is experienced by USA. Middle East shows a 94%
    reduction in cereal net import expenditures in ID, however with non-cereal crops
    included, the total reduction in crop trade expenditures is 42%. In CC, the revenue
    changes for Middle East are very small, with slightly increased crop trade expenditures.
    Effects on USA producer revenue from cereals are -18%. Middle East irrigation
