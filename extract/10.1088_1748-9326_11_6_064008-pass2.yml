Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (temperature and precipitation)
  5: Temperature, precipitation, population.
  6: Climate change, population pressure
  7: "Temperature, precipitation, population, and social crisis (specifically, the\
    \ period of AD 1643\u20131662 related to the Shun Dynasty, Manchu invasion, and\
    \ resulting chaos)."
  8: Population pressure increases economic vulnerabilities and impacts socioeconomic
    vulnerability to climate change.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change induces economic fluctuations in late imperial China, particularly
    in the long term; Temperature has a greater influence on the economy than precipitation,
    given that the economic center is located in South China; The population of China
    primarily act as consumers in the long term; The economic vulnerability in late
    imperial China under climate change is increased and is higher than that in early
    modern Europe.
  5: Temperature significantly impacts both real GDP per capita (positive) and rice
    price (negative). Population has a negative impact on real GDP per capita and
    a positive impact on rice price. Granger causality analysis suggests temperature
    Granger-causes real GDP per capita and rice price. Population does not Granger-cause
    real GDP per capita or rice price.
  6: Climate change dominates real GDP per capita and rice price in late imperial
    China, particularly in the long term.
  7: Social crisis during 1643-1662 had a statistically significant and negative impact
    on real GDP per capita. Temperature, precipitation and population all had statistically
    significant impacts on real GDP per capita.
  8: A larger population size increases economic vulnerability to climate change as
    it mainly acts as a consumer.
Methodology:
  1: Multivariate regression and Granger causality analyses are used to analyze the
    relationship between climate change and the economy in late imperial China (AD
    1600-1840) at the national level. The results are applicable to the period of
    late imperial China (AD 1600-1840).
  5: Regression analysis and Granger causality analysis (GCA) on low-pass filtered
    data from historical China. The regression analysis' lag is set to 1.
  6: Regression analysis and Granger Causality Analysis (GCA), results applicable
    to late imperial China (AD 1600-1840) and comparison to early modern Europe (AD
    1500-1800)
  7: A regression model using low-pass filtered data analyzes the impact of climatic
    and social factors on real GDP per capita in late imperial China. The results
    are applicable to the specific historical context of late imperial China (specifically,
    an agrarian economy).
More Notes:
  1: The paper revisits Malthusian and 'Great Divergence' theories by including the
    perspective of economic vulnerability under climate change.
  5: The adjusted R-squared for the real GDP per capita regression is 0.934 and for
    the rice price regression is 0.799. The paper states that the agrarian economy
    in late imperial China has a stronger link with temperature than with population.
  6: Temperature has a greater influence than precipitation on the agrarian economy
    of late imperial China. Population mainly acts as a consumer, increasing rice
    prices and dampening the buffering capacity of the economy.
  7: "The study uses a dummy variable, Crisis, to quantify the effect of social crisis\
    \ on the national economy, taking the value of 1 during AD 1643\u20131662 and\
    \ 0 otherwise. The analysis quantitatively justifies the influence of social crisis\
    \ on the agrarian economy in historical China."
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Real GDP per capita
  5: Real GDP per capita, rice price.
  6: Real GDP per capita is negatively affected by climate change.
  7: Real GDP per capita.
  8: Vulnerabilities in economic growth due to population size increasing economic
    vulnerability and reducing growth potential.
Quantitative material:
  1: The paper quantifies the relationship between climate change and the economy
    in late imperial China (AD 1600-1840) at the national level using multivariate
    regression and Granger causality analyses.
  5: Table 1 shows a regression model on real GDP per capita with coefficients for
    temperature (0.117), precipitation (0.181), and population (-5.67E-06). Table
    2 shows a regression model on rice price with coefficients for temperature (-0.253)
    and population (1.23E-05). Table 3 shows Granger causality analysis with F statistics
    and significance levels for temperature and population causing real GDP per capita
    and rice price.
  6: "P-value of GCA on population\u2013rice price relationship is 0.094"
  7: A regression model (Table 4) shows coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics,
    and significance levels for the impact of temperature (coefficient 0.148), precipitation
    (coefficient 0.386), population (coefficient -2.48E-06), a time trend (t, t2,
    and t3), and a crisis period (coefficient -0.229) on real GDP per capita. Adjusted
    R2 = 0.950.
