Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased mean temperatures and precipitations, and extreme events such as droughts
    and floods.
  3: Changes in the rainfall regime, specifically drought conditions and extreme precipitations.
  6: Temperature increase affecting the hydrological cycle.
  9: Significant precipitation reduction is expected in summer and spring, especially
    in Southern Italy, due to complex interactions including changes in water-holding
    capacity of the atmosphere, atmospheric circulation, evaporation, and topography.
  11: Changes in extreme precipitation (R99PTOT) driven by climate change scenarios
    (RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) leading to altered drought conditions and dry spell lengths.
  15: Climate change leading to increased frequency and intensity of heat waves and
    droughts.
Highlights:
  1: Drought conditions and extreme precipitations will likely exacerbate in Italy
    in the coming decades without mitigation (RCP 8.5), less critical with partial
    mitigation (RCP 4.5), and significantly reduced with decarbonization policies
    (RCP 2.6).
  3: The study investigates the drought conditions and extreme precipitations expected
    over Italy in coming decades.
  6: Higher RCP scenarios correspond with greater temperature increases across all
    seasons, with more intense changes during summer months (JJA).
  9: A significant precipitation reduction is expected in spring and summer over most
    of Italy under RCP 4.5 (up to 30%) and RCP 8.5 (up to 50%) by the end of the century.
  11: Maximum length of dry spells is expected to grow significantly, above all in
    summer in Southern Italy under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Increasing drought conditions
    in spring may seriously impact the agricultural sector.
  15: The paper finds that heat waves and droughts will be exacerbated in Italy in
    the coming decades.
Methodology:
  1: "Analysis based on high-resolution Euro-CORDEX models (12km resolution) under\
    \ RCP 8.5, RCP 4.5, and RCP 2.6 scenarios, comparing ensemble mean values for\
    \ 1971-2000 with short- (2021\u20132050), medium- (2041\u20132070) and long-term\
    \ (2071\u20132100) periods, using WMO ETCCDI indices (Consecutive Dry Days and\
    \ extreme precipitations) to investigate climate extremes."
  3: "Elaborates multi-model scenarios based on Euro-CORDEX simulations at 0.11\xB0\
    \ spatial resolution under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 to assess uncertainties in\
    \ future projections. Computes two WMO ETCCDI indices to investigate drought conditions\
    \ and extreme precipitations. Uses daily meteorological data from 14 high-resolution\
    \ Euro-CORDEX models from 1971 to 2100."
  6: Euro-CORDEX ensemble models are used to project temperature anomalies under different
    RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) for different seasons (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON) for
    the periods 2021-2050 and 2041-2070, compared to a 1971-2000 baseline.
  9: High-resolution Regional Climate Model (RCM) experiments are used to show the
    impact of topography and coastlines on large-scale signals; The WMO ETCCDI index
    CDD (Consecutive Dry Days) is used to characterize drought conditions.
  11: Assessment of changes in extreme precipitations by computing the WMO ETCCDI
    index R99PTOT (precipitation due to extremely wet days). 99th percentile fields
    computed at seasonal scale. Anomalies estimated by computing the differences between
    future (short-, medium-, and long-term) and reference R99PTOT values.
  15: The paper uses model simulations to project future heat waves and droughts in
    Italy.
More Notes:
  1: The study aims to analyze projected changes in mean temperatures and precipitations,
    and extreme events, highlighting some local trends in the different Italian regions
    that have been little considered to date, to support the development of national
    adaptation policies and measures.
  3: The analysis focuses on Italy and uses Euro-CORDEX models to project future climate
    scenarios. The emphasis is on changes in rainfall patterns rather than mean precipitation.
  6: The study focuses on Italy and presents spatial distributions of temperature
    changes. The link between water resource availability and the temperature changes
    is qualitative.
  9: Confidence in precipitation change is lower than in temperature change due to
    the complex interactions affecting precipitation. The multi-model reconstruction
    underestimates the CDD index in spring, autumn, and summer compared to E-OBS data
    but performs satisfactorily in reconstructing the pattern of seasonal CDD fields
    for the reference period (1971-2000), pointing towards more frequent events in
    summer in Southern Italy.
  11: The MMM seasonal reconstructions are wetter than the corresponding E-OBS scenarios
    over Southern Italy, with overestimations that reach up to 100%.
