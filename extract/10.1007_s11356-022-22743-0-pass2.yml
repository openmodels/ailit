Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme weather events negatively impact the agricultural economy; changes in
    rainfall and temperature.
  2: "Heavy rains; Flooding; Droughts; Rising sea levels; El Ni\xF1o-Southern Oscillation\
    \ (ENSO); Greenhouse gas emissions; Deforestation; Encroachment on natural water\
    \ resources; Improper land use; Windstorms"
  5: The variability or risk of economic value in the agricultural sector (measured
    by the variance of lnY) is influenced by climatic (lnAverT, lnMinT, lnMaxT, lnRf,
    lnRfd) and non-climatic (lnA, lnL) factors.
  6: Mean minimum temperature, mean maximum temperature, rainfall intensity, total
    rainfall, and the number of agricultural households.
  7: Mean average temperature, mean minimum temperature, mean maximum temperature,
    total rainfall, and rainfall intensification in Thailand.
  8: Climate change, extreme events, weather variability, global warming (specifically
    from agricultural production).
  10: lnAverT (log of Average Temperature), lnMinT (log of Minimum Temperature), lnMaxT
    (log of Maximum Temperature), lnL (log of L)
  11: No relevant information
  14: Climate change
Highlights:
  1: Extreme weather events have a negative impact, while increased rainfall has a
    positive association with the agricultural economy. Temperature changes reduce
    variability of agricultural growth.
  2: Climate change has a tremendously negative effect on economic growth in Thailand,
    especially impacting the agricultural sector.
  5: The ARDL bounds test is used to establish cointegration between lnY (log of Y)
    and the variance of lnY (lne^2) with independent variables of lnA, lnL, lnAverT.
  6: Total rainfall and agricultural households positively affect economic growth,
    while mean temperatures and rainfall intensity negatively impact it.
  7: Extreme events such as increases in mean maximum temperature, mean minimum temperature,
    and rainfall intensification, severely affect the agricultural economy in Thailand.
  8: Climate change affects economic growth with impacts on economy, society, and
    environment. Agricultural production is a key factor in global warming.
  10: The table shows whether the variables are stationary in levels I(0) or first
    differences I(1). Most variables, including temperature variables (lnAverT, lnMinT,
    lnMaxT), lnRf and log of GDP (lnY) appear to be non-stationary in levels but stationary
    in first differences, based on the p-values being less than 0.001 for the I(1)
    tests.
  11: Cointegration is found for lnY and lne^2 based on the F-statistic and p-value.
  14: Climate change and cotton production in Pakistan
Methodology:
  1: Uses panel data analysis from 1995 to 2019 for 76 provinces in Thailand; includes
    unit root tests, ARDL bounds for cointegration analysis, and PMG estimation for
    long-run and short-run effects.
  2: Panel data analysis to estimate the impact of climate and weather variability
    on the economic growth of the agricultural sector in Thailand; Uses time series
    data from 1995 to 2019 across 76 provinces; Considers non-climatic (agricultural
    land use, households) and climatic (rainfall, temperature) variables
  5: The study employs an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach
    to analyze the relationships between variables. It uses the Akaike information
    criterion (AIC) and the Schwarz information criterion (SIC) to determine lag lengths.
    Unit root tests (LLC, IPS, ADF-Fisher, PP-Fisher) are used to check for stationarity
    before applying the ARDL model.
  6: ARDL bounds testing and PMG estimation based on the Cobb-Douglas function; long-run
    coefficients are homogeneous across provinces and short-run coefficients are heterogeneous.
  7: ARDL-PMG estimation using the Cobb-Douglas structure.
  8: Empirical study providing an indirect analysis of the impact of climate and weather
    variability on the agricultural economy. Focuses on efficiency of agricultural
    production.
  10: Panel unit root tests (LLC, IPS, ADF-Fisher, PP-Fisher) are used to test for
    stationarity of the variables in the panel data.
  11: The analysis uses general-to-specific ARDL bounds tests to assess cointegration.
    Five different "Cases" are considered when conducting the bounds tests, as shown
    in the table.

    production model approach; Spurious regressions in econometrics; Production function

More Notes:
  2: The study aims to determine the factors that influence aggregate values of the
    agricultural sector in Thailand and is explicitly studying the impact on the value
    added and not just productivity as past papers have done. The study uses disaggregated
    (provincial) data for the period of 1995-2019.
  6: There is no long-run association of agricultural economy with agricultural land
    use and mean average temperature at a 0.05 significance level.
  7: The study confirms the existence of long-run equilibrium between climatic and
    non-climatic factors and the agricultural economy and its variability in Thailand.
  8: Emphasis on the need for government and stakeholder awareness of climate change's
    impact and the importance of agricultural production supervision and control.
  10: The 'ln' prefix indicates that the variables are in logarithmic form. Note in
    the table indicates that values in parentheses are p-values.
  11: The note references Pesaran et al. (2001) as the source for the bounds tests.
  14: References section, so only provides information *about* studies, not results
    from them. Several references focus on agricultural impacts, particularly crop
    yields and farming economics.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Increase in total rainfall positively impacts the agricultural economy; increases
    in mean average and mean minimum temperatures reduce variability of agricultural
    growth.

    sector
  5: The study focuses on ln Y (log of Y), an unspecified macroeconomic outcome, and
    the variance of ln Y (lne^2), to estimate the variability or risk of economic
    value in the agricultural sector.

    products decreased by US$ 2.5 billion due to the 2011 flood; Headline inflation
    reached 3.9 percent in 2011; 2015-2016 drought affected 187,351 farmers and damaged
    474,409 hectares of agricultural land, with estimated damage of US$ 468.72 million;
    Damage to agriculture due to droughts, floods, and windstorms in the past 24 years
    (from 1989 to 2012) was approximately US$ 5.77 billion
