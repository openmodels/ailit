Drivers of Risk:
  1: Weather shocks, climate change.
  2: Heat waves and droughts, weather shocks
  3: Rise in the variability of weather events, weather shocks, unsatisfactory levels
    of soil moisture for New Zealand.
  4: Weather shocks; Climate change projections (increased volatility of weather shocks).
  6: Temperature shocks; rainfall shocks; weather shocks measured through soil moisture
    deficits
  7: Severe droughts, measured using a soil moisture deficit index, where values above
    1 indicate severe episodes.
  8: Droughts (severe weather shocks).
  9: Adverse weather shocks (specifically drought, measured by soil moisture deficits).
  10: A 1% weather shock (drought).
  13: Weather fluctuations and shocks, particularly unexpected realizations of weather
    conditions such as droughts, affect agricultural land productivity.
  16: Weather shock deteriorates expected marginal benefit of lands and increases
    current cost of land maintenance.
  20: "Shock to absorption (G) that captures variations not taken into account in\
    \ the model, such as political cycles and international demand in intermediate\
    \ markets. Foreign consumption shocks (\u03B7Ct) impacting foreign demand and,\
    \ consequently, New Zealand's exports and exchange rates."
  21: The page mentions a time-preference shock impacting the household's discount
    factor, driving foreign real interest rates down.
  23: Drought index (soil moisture).
  25: "The damage function parameter \u03B8 connects temperature changes to output.\
    \ The paper also references shocks represented by innovations with standard errors\
    \ assumed to follow a Weibull distribution."
  27: Weather shocks; Extreme drought; Weather cycles
  29: Weather shocks (droughts) negatively affect land productivity in agriculture.
  30: Droughts and weather shocks impacting agricultural production.
  31: Supply shocks (technology, labor supply, and sectoral reallocation), demand
    shocks (government spending, household preferences, and investment), foreign shocks
    (consumption and foreign preferences), and weather shocks.
  32: Weather shocks (specifically soil moisture leading to enhanced land productivity
    or drought conditions).
  33: Weather shock (drought), land expenditure cost, labor sectoral cost, and land
    efficiency decay rate.
  34: "Change in the variance of weather shocks; Rate of decay of land productivity\
    \ (\u03B4\u2113); Cost of labor reallocation."
  35: Changes in the variance of weather shocks, specifically drought events, due
    to climate change.
  36: Weather shocks with varying intensities represented by different RCP scenarios
    (RCP 2.5, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, RCP 8.5).
  37: Weather shocks (specifically droughts), increasing variance of weather shocks
    due to climate change.
  38: Exogenous weather variations affecting land productivity in the agricultural
    sector; Increased variance of weather shocks due to climate change.
  41: Volatility in weather, specifically captured by a proxy for drought index, impacted
    by climate change.
  43: 'Various shocks: Economy-wide TFP, Hours supply, Spending, Investment, Sector
    reallocation, Weather, Foreign time-preference, Foreign consumption.'
  45: Weather shocks, specifically drought episodes inferred from a weather index
    time series.
Highlights:
  1: Weather shocks significantly impact GDP and agricultural output in New Zealand
    and entail welfare costs. Climate change amplifies these effects, increasing macroeconomic
    volatility and welfare costs.
  2: Weather shocks are likely to become a more frequent source of business cycles,
    in particular for agricultural-based countries.
  3: Adverse weather shocks lead to a large and persistent contraction of agricultural
    production, accompanied by a decline in consumption, investment and a rise in
    hours worked, and that weather shocks play a non-trivial role in driving the business
    cycles in New Zealand.
  4: Climate change critically increases the variability of key macroeconomic variables;
    The welfare cost of weather-driven business cycles increases due to climate change.
  6: Temperature shocks have a significant impact on productivity and welfare costs;
    the paper uses a theoretical model to analyze weather shocks, rather than relying
    solely on calibration exercises; the weather index includes both temperature and
    rainfall as determinants of agricultural productivity; the weather is measured
    through soil moisture deficits.
  7: New Zealand has experienced cyclical changes in soil water deficits, including
    severe droughts in 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2015, that have disrupted its economy.
  8: Droughts lead to a temporary decline in the agricultural sector's share of total
    output and, to a lesser extent, the primary sector. The tertiary sector tends
    to experience a relative expansion following droughts.
  9: An adverse weather shock (drought) causes a contraction of New Zealand's economy,
    with agricultural production being significantly affected.
  10: Weather shocks have persistent effects on the economy, particularly the labor
    market; weather mimics the dynamic patterns of a TFP shock; slow adjustment effect
    for the farmer problem.
  26: "The data were fairly informative about the posterior distributions, which did\
    \ not stay very close to their priors. The land-weather elasticity parameter (\u03B8\
    ) has a significant impact."
  27: The model suggests that weather conditions matter for generating business cycles;
    A high value for the damage function parameter is necessary to map the changes
    in the weather index and agricultural production cycles.
  29: Weather shocks matter in explaining the business cycles of New Zealand.
  30: Droughts lead to a contraction of economic activity, a weaker response of the
    real exchange rate, decreased agricultural production, and a fall in the trade
    balance and current account. The relative price in the agricultural sector rises,
    while the price of non-agricultural goods declines. The real exchange rate depreciates.
  31: Weather shocks cause important macroeconomic fluctuations, particularly in agricultural
    production and, over longer time horizons, in GDP. Foreign shocks have a significant
    short-run impact on GDP in New Zealand.
  32: Weather shocks have a significant impact on agricultural production in New Zealand,
    and these shocks spill over to affect GDP, consumption, and labor markets. Severe
    droughts can lead to contractions in GDP and consumption.
  33: "The land expenditure cost parameter (\u03C6) significantly affects the propagation\
    \ mechanism of a weather shock. Lower land expenditure returns generate a strong\
    \ recession in the agricultural sector due to a positive spike in its relative\
    \ price."
  34: Low decay rate of land productivity amplifies and makes macroeconomic fluctuations
    more persistent after a drought. Increased cost of labor reallocation amplifies
    the recession.
  35: Climate change-induced increases in the variance of weather shocks lead to significant
    increases in the volatility of key macroeconomic variables, particularly under
    pessimistic climate scenarios.
  36: Increased volatility in macroeconomic variables (GDP, consumption, investment,
    agriculture, etc.) is projected under all RCP scenarios. Welfare decreases (becomes
    more negative) under all RCP scenarios, indicating a welfare cost of climate change,
    which increases with the severity of the RCP scenario.
  37: The welfare cost of weather shocks (droughts) is non-trivial, even with a CRRA
    utility function, due to weather hysteresis effects (extended period of low productivity
    after an adverse weather shock).
  38: Weather shocks are important drivers of agricultural production and, to a lesser
    extent, GDP in New Zealand; Increased variability of weather events leads to increased
    variability of macroeconomic variables and welfare costs; Weather shock generates
    a recession through a contraction of agricultural production and investment combined
    with a rise in hours worked.
  43: Posterior distributions of key parameters are estimated, showing how the model's
    uncertainty about these parameters is updated based on the data.
  45: Figure 8 shows the impact of weather shocks on selected variables by comparing
    growth rates with and without weather shocks, emphasizing the contribution of
    drought events to the deviation.
Methodology:
  1: Uses a Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) model on New Zealand data and estimates a
    general equilibrium model with a weather-dependent agricultural sector.
  2: Providing a quantitative framework that directly addresses the short term dimension
    of the weather; reconciling theoretical models of the weather with the data, using
    the weather as an observable variable; disentangling the contribution of weather
    shocks from alternative sources of business cycles and originally price.
  3: 'Two-step strategy: 1) SVAR model to document the transmission mechanisms of
    weather shocks. 2) DSGE model with a weather-dependent agricultural sector estimated
    using Bayesian techniques.'
  4: Theoretical model connecting the macroeconomy with the weather, using counterfactual
    analysis to evaluate the impact of increased weather shock volatility on macroeconomic
    volatility.
  6: Real business cycle model with temperature levels as an explanatory factor of
    productivity for the US economy; DSGE model; empirical evidence regarding the
    impact of weather shocks on macroeconomic variables.
  7: The paper analyzes changes in the relative share of each sector in total production
    of New Zealand following severe drought events. The analysis focuses on the four
    most severe droughts (presumably within the time series). The index is based on
    the balance between rainfalls and temperatures.
  8: The analysis examines the evolution of sectoral shares in total production before
    and after drought events, normalizing the sector's share to 100 at the time of
    the drought. Correlations between a weather index and sectoral GDP shares are
    computed using the Pearson test.
  9: A structural vector autoregressive (VAR) model is used to investigate the interactions
    between weather and macroeconomic time series in New Zealand. The VAR includes
    constraints to reflect New Zealand's small open economy status and the exogeneity
    of weather. A lower triangular Choleski decomposition is used to derive orthogonal
    impulse responses to a one-standard-deviation shock in the drought variable. The
    model is estimated with one lag.
  10: SVAR impulse response analysis; DSGE modeling; two-sector, two-good small open
    economy model with flexible exchange rate.
  13: The analysis uses a damage function to relate weather conditions to land productivity
    and emphasizes weather hysteresis effects, impacting long-term production dynamics.
  16: Examines effects of agricultural production through the lens of concave vs.
    convex cost functions under weather shocks and explores labor disutility through
    a CES labor disutility index.
  20: "Small open economy model, similar to those of Adolfson et al. (2007, 2008)\
    \ and Justiniano and Preston (2010b). Foreign economy modeled as an endowment\
    \ economy with exogenous foreign consumption. Estimation of parameters \u03C3\
    C and \u03C1C to capture variations of the foreign demand."
  21: The model involves aggregating agents and varieties in the economy and imposing
    market clearing to derive equilibrium conditions.
  22: "The model is estimated using Bayesian methods and quarterly data for New Zealand.\
    \ The structural parameters and the sequence of shocks are estimated following\
    \ Smets and Wouters (2007) and An and Schorfheide (2007). A linear approximation\
    \ to the model\u2019s policy function is used, and the Kalman filter is employed."
  23: Bayesian estimation with a VAR model. Data is detrended using a quadratic trend.
    Daily weather data is aggregated to compute a soil moisture index for each local
    state, then aggregated at the national level using agricultural output weights.
  25: The paper uses Bayesian estimation with specific prior distributions for parameters
    in a macroeconomic model. It refers to Smets and Wouters (2007) for some prior
    specifications. It also mentions a VAR model for comparison of model results.
  26: The study uses Bayesian estimation with a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to estimate
    the posterior distributions of structural parameters for a macroeconomic model.
    The dynare package (Adjemian et al., 2011) is used for estimation. Model identifiability
    is assessed using methods by Iskrevet (2010). Convergence is assessed using Brooks
    and Gelman (1998).
  27: Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model; Simulates moments and compares
    them with empirical data; Focuses on the damage function's impact on land productivity
  29: Uses a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model and Structural Vector
    Autoregression (SVAR) estimation to analyze the impact of weather shocks.
  30: A Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model is used, compared against
    a Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model. The DSGE model captures the impact
    of weather shocks on agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, sectoral prices,
    trade balance, and the real exchange rate. It's applicable to analyzing the macroeconomic
    effects of weather shocks in a country like New Zealand with a significant agricultural
    export sector.
  31: The analysis uses a variance decomposition to assess the impact of different
    shocks on macroeconomic variables at different time horizons (2, 10, and 50 quarters,
    and unconditional variance).
  32: Historical decomposition of business cycles using an estimated model. The model
    simulates the response to weather shocks and other estimated shocks. The applicability
    of the results is specific to New Zealand.
  33: The analysis uses a macroeconomic model with a weather-dependent agricultural
    sector. It examines the impulse response functions (IRFs) of the model under different
    calibrations of key parameters to a weather shock. Steady state of the model is
    drawn prior to the realization of the shock in t=1, IRFs are expressed in percentage
    deviations from the steady state of the estimated model.
  34: The paper uses a framework that, unlike standard models, can tackle the implications
    of a change in the variance of weather shocks. It estimates weather shock variance
    under different climate scenarios and investigates the effects on aggregate fluctuations.
  35: Uses a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model to simulate the effects
    of altered weather shock variability on macroeconomic variables. Compares volatility
    under historical weather conditions (1989-2014) to volatility under future climate
    scenarios (2015-2100), normalizing historical values to 100.
  36: The model is simulated, and theoretical variances of each variable are estimated
    and normalized to 100. Variances of weather shocks are modified to reflect different
    climate scenarios. New simulations are run with modified weather shock variances,
    and theoretical variances of variables of interest are compared to those of the
    reference period. Welfare costs are calculated based on the fraction of consumption
    households are willing to give up to live in an economy free of weather shocks.
  37: Simulations using a macroeconomic model; Climate change is approximated by increasing
    the variance of weather shocks, without accounting for crop and livestock adaptation.
  38: Developed and estimated a DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium) model
    for New Zealand, including an agricultural sector with weather-dependent land
    productivity; SVAR (Structural Vector Autoregression) model; Business cycle decomposition
    exercises; Analyzed climate change by increasing the variance of weather shocks
    consistently with projections in 2100.
  41: "Uses simulated monthly climate data from the Community Climate System Model\
    \ (CCSM) with a 0.9\xB0\xD71.25\xB0 grid resolution to project data from 2006\
    \ to 2100 under four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)."
  43: Bayesian estimation of a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model.
    Applicable on a quarterly basis.
  45: The model is fed with all shocks (actual data) to produce a blue line, and then
    fed only with weather shocks to produce a red line. This allows for isolating
    the impact of weather shocks. Shaded area indicates the 10th percent of the most
    severe drought episodes.
More Notes:
  1: The analysis is specific to New Zealand.
  2: Focuses on the short-term dimension of weather shocks and the need for policymakers
    to cope with their implications.
  3: The study uses New Zealand data due to its exposure to weather shocks and relatively
    small size. The weather is treated as an exogenous process.
  4: The paper contributes to the literature using theoretical models to connect the
    macroeconomy with weather, differentiating itself from integrated assessment models
    (IAMs).
  6: The paper focuses on short-term effects of weather shocks and analyzes the fluctuations
    and welfare costs induced by weather shocks under different climate scenarios;
    Section 2 provides business cycle evidence on weather shocks; the model takes
    into account the agriculture sector as one mechanism through which weather shocks
    affect the wider economy
  7: The paper uses a soil moisture deficit index to date and monitor severe weather
    events. The index construction details are in the online appendix. Figure 2 (not
    provided) reports the changes in sectoral shares.
  8: The secondary sector shows no clear reaction to drought shocks. The weather index
    used in Table 1 is not defined on this page.
  9: "The analysis assumes human activities do not significantly affect the occurrence\
    \ of droughts due to the restricted time period of the data. Foreign variables\
    \ are a weighted average of GDP for New Zealand\u2019s top trading partners."
  10: The model includes an agricultural and a non-agricultural sector, with agricultural
    workers facing unexpected weather conditions affecting land productivity; the
    model setup includes a home country (New Zealand) and its trading partners.
  22: The equations presented define the equilibrium of the agricultural goods market,
    GDP, the law of motion for foreign debt, and the trade balance. The general equilibrium
    condition is also defined.
  25: "The paper uses a two-sector model and focuses on the role of land in the production\
    \ function and how that might be impacted by climate change (e.g. through the\
    \ land efficiency decay rate parameter \u03B4\u2113)."
  26: The analysis focuses on New Zealand. Standard parameters are estimated in line
    with business cycle literature (Smets and Wouters, 2007; Lubik, 2006). Shocks
    are excluded from the analysis described on this page.
  27: The model overstates total output and consumption volatility.
  29: The DSGE model provides micro-founded mechanisms for how weather shocks propagate
    through the economy, unlike the SVAR model.
  30: The model suggests a boom in the non-agricultural sector due to increased demand,
    partially offsetting the negative impacts of the agricultural decline. The exchange
    rate depreciation helps restore the competitiveness of farmers.
  31: The paper highlights a persistence mechanism related to weather hysteresis effects.
  32: The paper focuses on the impact of weather shocks, particularly droughts, on
    the New Zealand economy.
  33: "The model's originality lies in the introduction of a weather-dependent agricultural\
    \ sector that relies on a set of structural parameters driving the response of\
    \ the economy following a weather shock. The parameter \u03B9 determines the household\
    \ labor supply substitution across sectors, contrasting a situation with a perfect\
    \ labor mobility across sectors at a business cycle frequency versus a very costly\
    \ substitution."
  35: Analysis focuses on New Zealand. Scenarios include a declining drought variance
    (-8.03%) which results in decreased macroeconomic fluctuations, and variance increases
    of 14.11% (less pessimistic) to 51.91% (most pessimistic).
  36: The authors suggest that the results are likely exacerbated in developing economies
    with a large agricultural sector and lower capital intensity. The online appendix
    contains a closed-form expression of the welfare index. The analysis uses a second
    order approximation to calculate welfare.
  37: The welfare costs under increased weather shock variance are considered a maximum
    bound of feasible welfare costs, as they do not account for adaptation.
  38: The framework could be applied to developing countries to highlight their vulnerability
    to weather shocks and to evaluate optimal monetary and fiscal policies to mitigate
    the effects of weather shocks; Fiscal policy, such as disaster payments, could
    play a role in low-income countries in the absence of well-functioning insurance
    markets.
  43: "The model incorporates both economy-wide and sector-specific shocks, including\
    \ weather shocks. The parameters related to international trade (\u03B1N, \u03B1\
    A, \u03C7B, \xB5A, \xB5N) suggest an open economy model."

Quantitative material:
  1: Weather shocks explain about 35% of GDP and agricultural output fluctuations
    in New Zealand. Weather shocks entail a welfare cost of 0.30% of permanent consumption.
    Climate change increases macroeconomic volatility, resulting in a higher welfare
    cost peaking to 0.46% in the worst-case scenario.
  2: "Heat waves and droughts have been causing signi\uFB01cant damages at global\
    \ level peaking to a total value of US$25 billion in 2012."
  3: No specific quantitative estimates are provided on this page, but the paper aims
    to quantify climate change impacts through a rise in weather variability.
  4: Households would be willing to give up 0.30% of unconditional consumption to
    rule out weather shocks; Welfare cost of weather-driven business cycles peaks
    up to 0.46% in the worst-case climate change scenario.
  6: A one-standard deviation temperature shock causes a 1.4 percentage point decrease
    in productivity growth.
  7: The soil moisture deficit index ranges from -4 to +4. Severe episodes are defined
    as periods when the index peaks above 1. The paper examines sectoral shares two
    quarters before and four quarters after severe drought events.
  8: Table 1 presents correlations between a weather index and sectoral GDP shares.
    It shows statistically significant negative correlations for agriculture (-0.31)
    and primary sector (-0.25), and a positive correlation for the tertiary sector
    (0.39).
  9: A rise in soil moisture deficits implies a contemporaneous 0.12% contraction
    of agricultural production; The depression in agricultural production reaches
    a peak decline of 1.27% after three periods.
  10: A 1% weather shock (drought) leads to a 0.2% decline in consumption and a 0.1%
    decline in investment.
  22: The model uses quarterly data for New Zealand.
  23: Dataset includes 8 time series from 1994Q2 to 2016Q4 (91 observations). Observable
    variables are transformed to be stationary. Weather index is zero mean.
  26: The prior distribution for a key parameter of the damage function is a uniform
    distribution with zero mean and a standard deviation of 500. The posterior moments
    of parameters are computed using a sample of 800,000, discarding the first 80,000,
    and based on eight parallel chains.
  27: Average damage to land productivity is below 0.0008% due to average weather
    shocks; An average weather shock slashes land productivity by 15%; An extreme
    drought cuts land productivity by 26%; An extreme drought would directly reduce
    agricultural production by 3.6%
  29: Drought shock decreases land productivity by 22%.
  30: Forecast error variance decomposition for aggregate real production, real agricultural
    production, real consumption, and hours worked is presented in Figure 7, considering
    time horizons ranging from two quarters.
  31: Foreign shocks account for 18.4% of New Zealand's production in the short run,
    and 8.1% in the long run. Weather shocks contribute 3.7% to GDP variance at a
    two-quarter horizon, increasing to 35% for the unconditional variance. Supply
    shocks account for 89% of the variance of agricultural production at a two-quarter
    horizon, declining to 57% for the unconditional variance.
  32: Weather shocks can contribute between +4% and -6% to agricultural production
    growth. Weather shocks can contribute between +2% to -2% to GDP and consumption
    growth rates. Weather-driven changes in aggregate labor demand oscillate between
    -0.5% to 0.9%. The 2008 and 2016 droughts entailed a joint 1% contraction in GDP
    and consumption while labor supplied increased by 1%. One fourth of agricultural
    slowdown following the most severe drought in 2008 is accounted by the weather
    shock. In 2016, a prolonged episode of drought also contributed by 5% to the contraction
    of the agricultural supply.
  33: "The paper contrasts the responses of the model under different calibrations\
    \ for three key parameters: \u03C6 = 2.57 (estimated), 1.57 (lower), 3.57 (higher);\
    \ \u03B9 = 0 (linear), 2.9 (estimated), 5 (high)."
  35: Under RCP 8.5, variance of total output rises by 19.19%, agricultural production
    volatility rises by 21.88%, consumption variance rises by 27.09%, relative price
    of agricultural goods variance rises by 16.8%, net foreign asset variance rises
    by 31.86%, current account variance rises by 11.45%, real exchange rate variance
    rises by 7.54%.
  36: Table 3 presents percentage changes in variances of macroeconomic variables
    and welfare measures under different climate change scenarios (RCPs) relative
    to a historical baseline (1994-2016).
  37: New Zealanders would be willing to give up to 0.3% of their unconditional consumption
    to live in an economy free of droughts; Welfare cost of business cycles induced
    by productivity shocks is 0.08%, spending shocks is 0.05%, investment shocks is
    0.06%, labor supply shocks is 0.75%, sector reallocation shock is 0.12%, foreign
    consumption shock is 0.003% and foreign discount factor is 0.06%; Under the optimistic
    (RCP 2.5) climate change scenario, households would abandon 0.30% of their permanent
    consumption; Under the worst-case climate change scenario, this fraction would
    reach 0.46%; Welfare cost increased by 0.09, from 0.19 for the historical period
    to 0.28% for the worst-case scenario.
  38: Households are willing to pay 0.30% of their unconditional consumption to live
    in a world with no weather shocks.
  43: Table 4 presents calibrated parameter values. Table 5 presents prior and posterior
    distributions for various parameters and shock processes. Posterior distributions
    are presented as mean and [5%:95%] credible intervals.
  45: The red line in Figure 8 depicts the contribution of weather shocks to deviations
    in the annual growth rates of selected observable variables.
