Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Minimum temperature, fluctuating temperatures above and below 0\u25E6C, and\
    \ windchill during the cold period."
  2: Meteorological factors such as temperature and precipitation during the winter
    period are identified as critical for winter survival of canola.
  3: Meteorological variables during the cold period (CP), including temperature,
    precipitation, wind velocity, solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and evapotranspiration.
    Specifically, the duration of the cold period, the number of temperature cycles
    (shifts from negative to positive), and various temperature descriptors (Warmest,
    Warm, Mild, Cold, Colder, Coldest) and temperature difference descriptors (Extreme,
    High, Medium, Low).
  5: Colder periods, wind chill, and cycle numbers are identified as influencing factors
    on canola survival.
  6: 'Survival is impacted by meteorological conditions defined as clusters: poor,
    medium, and high.'
  7: "Meteorological variables during the cold period (CP), specifically Colder (5\
    \ days), ncycle (24 cycles), cET (465 mm cumulative ET), meanWindchill (-3.6\u25E6\
    C), Colder_pct (3%), and maxTmean (13.4\u25E6C)."
Evaluation overview:
  1: Winter survival of canola plants.
  2: The paper aims to evaluate winter canola survival, yield performance, and other
    agronomic traits, providing insights into areas of adaptation for current germplasm
    across the U.S.
  3: Winter survival of canola, measured as the percentage of plants alive in spring
    relative to those present before winter.
  5: The analysis evaluates canola meteorological survival clusters across various
    regions in the US.
  6: The paper evaluates winter survival of canola genotypes across different meteorological
    survival clusters (poor, medium, and high).
  7: Winter canola survival, ranging from 0 to 100%.
Highlights:
  1: Identified meteorological factors underpinning winter canola survival, built
    probabilistic response models for different severities of winter kill, and defined
    areas of adaptation of current germplasm in the US.
  2: Significant breeding efforts have increased winter hardiness of canola genotypes,
    thereby encouraging the evaluation of these genotypes for broader adaptation and
    production.
  5: Seven terminal nodes in the decision tree indicate meteorological conditions
    influencing canola survival rates.
  6: Environmental factors account for the majority (71%) of winter survival variation;
    tolerant genotypes show higher survival rates even in poor meteorological conditions.
  7: Canola winter survival was determined by meteorological survival cluster and
    interaction with genotype.
Methodology:
  1: Regression tree analysis on National Winter Canola Variety Trials data from 2003-2018,
    with auxiliary meteorological data over the last 40 years.
  2: Field trials conducted from the National Winter Canola Variety Trial (NWCVT)
    were analyzed, focusing on evaluating winter survival across 94 unique sites over
    multiple years.
  3: Daily weather data from Google Climate Engine (1979-2019) is used to characterize
    winter harshness, identify the beginning and end of the cold period (CP), build
    a model to predict meteorological survival clusters, and predict the probability
    of occurrence over 40 years. Analysis involves calculating means, differences
    between maximum and minimum temperature, and growing degree days. A mixed linear
    model is used to estimate the effects of environment and genotype by environment
    interactions on winter survival.
  5: The analysis uses a conditional inference tree model with meteorological data
    collected from 190 site-years, categorized into survival clusters.
  6: Analyses conducted using mixed-effect models and statistical analyses in R; used
    for determining genotype survival behavior.
  7: A conditional inference tree classified site-year cold periods into seven terminal
    nodes based on meteorological variables from 1979-2019. Site-year modeled survival
    was grouped into poor, medium, and high survival clusters.
More Notes:
  1: Identified four distinct genotype survival groups (tolerant, semi-tolerant, semi-susceptible,
    and susceptible) based on response to meteorological conditions.
  7: 'Four genotype-specific behaviors were identified: tolerant, semi-tolerant, semi-susceptible,
    and susceptible, with varying survival rates depending on the meteorological survival
    cluster.'
  10: This page is a list of crop varieties and their characteristics (decade of release
    and type). It provides context for the experiment that would be described elsewhere
    in the paper. The varieties are split into sensitive and semi-susceptible groups,
    so the results of the paper likely involve a comparison between these two groups.
  11: This page primarily lists different genotypes of canola, their decade of release,
    and type (hybrid or open-pollinated). While the heading "Susceptible" appears,
    it is not clear what these varieties are susceptible to based on the content of
    this page alone. The references at the bottom do not seem to be directly related
    to the canola genotype table.
Quantitative material:
  1: 'Cold periods across all site-years were classified into three clusters: cold
    periods with high (96%), medium (70%), and low (28%) average plant winter survival.'
  3: "Number of days for temperature descriptors (Warmest, Warm, Mild, Cold, Colder,\
    \ Coldest, with thresholds at 5, 0, -5, -10, -15 \xB0C) and temperature difference\
    \ descriptors (Extreme, High, Medium, Low, with thresholds at 16.7, 13.4, 10 \xB0\
    C). Also calculates minimum, mean, and maximum values for daily mean temperature,\
    \ daily minimum temperature, daily maximum temperature, and delta temperature\
    \ (difference between max and min daily temp). Cumulative values for precipitation,\
    \ reference evapotranspiration, solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit and canola\
    \ growing degree days. Mean wind velocity and wind chill."
  5: The survival clusters are categorized as High, Medium, and Poor, with proportions
    provided for each node in the decision tree.
  6: 'Winter survival variation explained: Environmental effects (E) 71%, Genotypic
    effects (G) 3%, Genotype by Environment interaction (GxE) 7%, with 19% pooled
    into residuals.'
  7: Overall winter survival averaged 84%.
