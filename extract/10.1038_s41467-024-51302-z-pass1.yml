  9: No relevant information
Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change, changing human population dynamics, intensifying climate change,
    regional population growth
  3: Emergence and disappearance of water scarcity on a global scale.
  4: Increased water scarcity (defined as per-capita water availability falling below
    1000 m3/person/year for a minimum of five consecutive years) driven by climate
    change under different RCP-SSP scenarios.
  7: Climate change scenarios (RCP6.0 vs RCP2.6) and population scenarios (SSP3 vs
    SSP2) impact water scarcity.
Highlights:
  2: FirstWS occurred predominantly in Asia and Africa historically, peaking around
    the 1980s. Under future scenarios, FirstWS will likely occur mainly in some regions
    of Africa. EndWS will mostly occur in China after 2050 due to projected declining
    population.
  3: Novel approach introduced to identify onset and relief of water scarcity globally.
  4: Africa is projected to experience the most prevalent new water scarcity in the
    future (2021-2090), with new scarcity areas more than double that of Asia under
    the RCP2.6-SSP2 scenario. China and India are identified as the countries with
    the largest areas impacted by FirstWS in the historical period.
  7: High population growth could significantly aggravate water scarcity.
Methodology:
  2: "Using ensembles of simulations with six Global Hydrological Models under two\
    \ representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP6.0) combined with two shared\
    \ socioeconomic pathways (SSP2, SSP3) for 1901\u20132090 to assess the timing\
    \ of FirstWS and EndWS."
  3: Global analysis using six Global Hydrological Models and four General Circulation
    Models to assess water scarcity from 1901 to 2090.
  4: The analysis uses a multi-model ensemble of 24 GHM-GCM combinations to project
    the median year of FirstWS (year of first water scarcity) under historical and
    future climate scenarios (RCP2.6-SSP2 and RCP6.0-SSP3).
  7: Compares the difference in FirstWS and EndWS between climate change scenarios
    by fixing population scenarios and vice versa to assess the impact of each.
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on water scarcity as a risk factor.
  3: The study specifically focuses on water scarcity rather than directly linking
    to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes.
  4: The definition of 'FirstWS' is important. The study identifies both 'FirstWS'
    (the initial year of water scarcity) and 'EndWS' (when water scarcity ends). The
    analysis distinguishes between areas that always, never, or intermittently experience
    water scarcity. The projections depend on the RCP-SSP scenarios used (RCP2.6-SSP2
    and RCP6.0-SSP3), and spatial distributions of FirstWS are provided.
  7: FirstWS is defined as the initial year when per-capita water availability falls
    below 1000 m3/person/year. EndWS is defined as the first year when water scarcity
    is relieved for a continuous period of five years or more.

  4: No relevant information

Quantitative material:
  2: No relevant information
  3: No quantitative information specifically related to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  7: Under the RCP6.0 scenario, slightly more areas experience delayed FirstWS compared
    with RCP2.6. There are more delayed areas in RCP6.0 compared to RCP2.6 concerning
    EndWS.
