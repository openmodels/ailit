Drivers of Risk:
  1: Decreasing precipitation trends and their impact on agricultural systems.
  4: Decrease in annual precipitation impacting agriculture in the Argentine Pampas,
    particularly affecting rain-fed agricultural production.
  5: Rainfall decrease impacts agricultural practices and economic profits.
  7: Decadal climate variability, drier conditions towards the end of the simulated
    sequence, natural weather variability.
  8: Decreasing precipitation trends; Climate variability; Changes in radiation levels
    and minimum temperatures.
  9: Inter-decadal climate variability, specifically decreasing precipitation.
  10: Decreasing rainfall trends, particularly their impact on crop yields; vulnerability
    of specific crops to climate change (wheat/soybean more vulnerable than maize
    in Pilar); failure to adapt to changing climate.
Highlights:
  1: Decreasing precipitation may cause a marked decrease in profits and increase
    in production risks, particularly in marginal areas like Pilar, Argentina, while
    more productive areas like Pergamino may remain unaffected.
  4: Significant patterns include a projected decrease in annual precipitation in
    Pilar and variability in Pergamino, impacting future agricultural conditions.
  5: Simulated economic profits were used to quantify impacts of rainfall decrease
    on current agricultural practices.
  7: The paper assesses economic impacts of different climate adaptation strategies
    on agricultural production, specifically focusing on economic returns and production
    risk.
  8: Decreasing precipitation trends significantly impacted economic profits of current
    cropping practices, particularly in the marginal production area of Pilar; The
    probability of negative economic returns (PNER) increased significantly for all
    crops in Pilar due to decreasing precipitation, while PNER remained low in Pergamino.
  9: Even belated adaptation is better than no adaptation in the face of decreasing
    precipitation. Adaptation helps stabilize the probability of negative returns.
  10: Decreasing rainfall may endanger future viability of continuous agriculture
    in climatically marginal regions; any type of adaptation, including delayed adaptation,
    can help reduce the negative impacts of unfavorable climate scenarios; the decrease
    in profits and increase in risks was much more marked than in Pergamino.
Methodology:
  4: The analysis involves estimating past trends in precipitation, using these to
    project future precipitation changes, and generating daily weather sequences using
    a semi-parametric stochastic weather model.
  5: Dynamic, process-level crop models simulate crop growth and development as a
    function of daily weather, soil type, and crop genetic characteristics using the
    DSSAT package.
  7: "Simulation of farmer responses to climate change, including a 'na\xEFve' farmer\
    \ (no adaptation), a 'clairvoyant' farmer (perfect adaptation), and an intermediate\
    \ farmer (adaptation based on the previous 4 cycles). Optimal land allocations\
    \ are identified using a genetic algorithm (GA)."
  8: Genetic algorithm (GA) used to optimize land allocation for crop management based
    on climate scenarios and economic conditions; Crop-specific economic returns are
    calculated based on area-weighted combination of profits; CPT value function used
    to represent fitness of solutions. Analysis applicable to Pilar and Pergamino
    regions in Argentina. The time horizon for simulation is 24 years.
  9: "The study uses simulations of agricultural systems in the Argentine Pampas under\
    \ different climate scenarios and adaptation strategies over cropping cycles.\
    \ Three adaptation types are simulated: 'instant adaptation' (clairvoyant farmer),\
    \ 4-yr adaptation, and 'no adaptation' (na\xEFve farmer). Results are displayed\
    \ for Cycles 5 to 24."
  10: "Simulation of farmer behavior under different climate scenarios (na\xEFve,\
    \ clairvoyant, delayed adaptation); analysis of the impact of decreasing rainfall\
    \ on crop yields and economic outcomes; consideration of technological innovations\
    \ like drought-tolerant crops."
More Notes:
  1: Potential negative impacts might be mitigated if farmers adapt agronomic management
    with existing technology or know-how.
  5: The probability of negative economic returns (PNER) was used to quantify economic
    risks to production associated with climate trends.
  8: The study uses a reference value for income based on renting out land instead
    of farming it, assumed to be $170/ha for Pilar and $230/ha for Pergamino. The
    profitability of crops is based on the economic context typical of the last few
    years (prior to 2009, when the article was published). The study explores different
    adaptation strategies, including a naive farmer, a clairvoyant farmer, and an
    intermediate situation where adaptation is based on the previous 4 cropping cycles.
  9: The study focuses on two locations in the Pampas, Pilar and Pergamino, representing
    different climate conditions. In Pergamino, there are no marked differences in
    profits or economic risks between the adaptation and no adaptation situations,
    however there are still changes in optimal land allocation throughout the cropping
    cycles.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Potential economic impacts of changing precipitation trends on agricultural systems
    in Argentina.
  5: Economic profits per hectare are computed as the difference between gross income
    and costs.
  7: Economic returns (production income) for soybean, maize, and wheat/soybean double
    crop; Probability of negative economic returns (a metric of production risk).
  8: Economic profits from crop production; Probability of Negative Economic Returns
    (PNER).
  9: Farm-wide economic returns (measured in $ per hectare) and the probability of
    negative farm-wide economic returns (a metric of production risk).
  10: Profits and economic risks of farmers in specific regions (Pilar and Pergamino)
    due to changes in precipitation; viability of continuous agriculture in marginal
    regions of the Pampas; potential yield decreases of maize and soybeans.
Quantitative material:
  5: "Indirect costs were assumed to be $70 ha\u20131 for both locations."
  7: Figure 4 shows the temporal evolution of economic returns and the probability
    of negative economic returns for different cropping systems in two regions (Pergamino
    and Pilar). Simulated profits for 24 cropping cycles are used.
  8: Wheat/soybean double crop in Pilar decreased from $80/ha to close to $0 over
    24 years; Maize in Pilar decreased to 75% of initial value over 24 years; Soybean
    in Pilar decreased to about 40% of initial value over 24 years; PNER for maize
    in Pilar increased from 0.15 to 0.55 over 24 years; PNER for full-cycle soybean
    in Pilar increased from 0.05 to 0.20 over 24 years; Chance of negative profits
    for wheat/soybean in Pilar increased from 0.35 to 0.65 over 24 years.
  9: Figure 5 shows the temporal evolution of farm-wide economic returns and the probability
    of negative farm-wide economic returns for different adaptation strategies. Without
    adaptation, the probability of economic failure increases rapidly with decreasing
    precipitation, reaching about 0.35 by the end of the sequence from an initial
    0.20.
  10: "Simulated yield decreases for maize in Pilar range from 76 to 93 kg ha\u2013\
    1 yr\u20131; recent average yield increases from crop breeding for maize are 100\
    \ to 250 kg ha\u20131 yr\u20131; projected decreases in full-cycle soybean yields\
    \ in Pilar are 20 to 25 kg ha\u20131 yr\u20131; recent breeding increases for\
    \ soybean are 12 to 16 kg ha\u20131 yr\u20131; probability of economic losses\
    \ for wheat/soybean in Pilar doubles from once in 3 years to twice in 3 years;\
    \ farmers in Pilar growing maize currently experience economic losses once every\
    \ 6 or 7 years, but in the future may lose money in 5 of 10 years."
