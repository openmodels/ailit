  6: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  4: Climate modes (ENSO, IOD, TAV, NAO).
  5: Climate modes such as ENSO, IOD, TAV, and NAO influence crop yield variability
    at regional and global scales.
  6: "ENSO events (El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a) are identified as a major driver of\
    \ synchronous crop failures."
  9: "ENSO (El Ni\xF1o-Southern Oscillation) teleconnections"
Highlights:
  4: Positive and negative climate teleconnections to maize yields are minimally offsetting,
    while teleconnections to wheat and soybean yields are substantially offsetting.
  5: "ENSO has the potential to force globally synchronous maize failures, as evidenced\
    \ in 1983 during strong El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a events."
  6: ENSO played a major role in forcing synchronous crop failures in 1983, the most
    extensive synchronous crop failure in modern (after 1960) record.
  9: Synchronous crop failures and climate-forced production variability.
Methodology:
  4: Variance analysis of harvested area of wheat, maize, and soybean in numbered
    regions, explaining the percent of national or subnational scale variance explained
    by climate modes.
  5: The analysis uses an MCA (Maximum Covariance Analysis) to study the effect of
    climate modes on crop yield anomalies during specific ENSO events.
More Notes:
  4: Heavy irrigation of wheat in China and India explains the muted effect of climate
    modes on wheat. Maize tends to be more strongly affected by climate modes than
    wheat or soybeans.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  4: National or subnational scale variance in crop production (wheat, maize, soybean).
  9: Crop failures and climate-forced production variability.
Quantitative material:
  4: Climate modes account for 18% of variability of global maize production, 7% of
    variability of global soybean production, and 6% of variability of global wheat
    production.
  6: Presents maps of observed and ENSO-forced percent crop yield anomalies in 1983,
    and maize production anomalies (kg) by country.
