Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (specifically surface temperature increase), particulate pollution,
    ozone pollution
  5: Climate and pollution factors impact crop yields. Specific pollutants mentioned
    are aerosols (AOD) and surface ozone.
  7: Ozone concentration, near-surface air temperature, precipitation, anthropogenic
    aerosols (AOD).
  10: Temperature, precipitation, AOD (aerosol optical depth), surface ozone, global
    warming, air pollution (particulate matter), drought.
  11: Temperature, precipitation, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and surface ozone levels
    are identified as key drivers of risk affecting crop yields.
Highlights:
  1: Particulate pollution mitigation outweighed the negative impacts of climate change
    on crop yields in China during 2010-2018. Future climate change impacts will dominate
    over pollution factors, reducing future maize and rice yields.
  5: Rice production has a quasi-linear increase from 1980-2018, driven by technological
    advancement. Maize production experienced a faster increase after 2005. High planted
    fraction of rice is concentrated in southeastern China.
  7: Pollution had a more pronounced negative impact on crop yields than climate variations
    from 1980 to 2010. Pollution mitigation after 2010 resulted in increased crop
    yields, but this was partially offset by increased ozone pollution, particularly
    in the North China Plain.
  10: Particulate pollution plays a critical role in regulating interannual variations
    of crop yields in China. Recent abatement of anthropogenic emissions results in
    a net crop gain, which masks crop loss due to increased temperature and precipitation.
    Air pollution control policies have a co-benefit from agriculture and food perspectives,
    but this benefit may be outweighed by global warming.
Methodology:
  1: Crop yield prediction models based on historical crop data, climate and pollution
    records in China since 1980. Machine-learning model to develop long-term surface
    ozone concentration data set.
  5: The study analyzes historical yield responses to climate and pollution factors
    from 1980 to 2018. Regression models were used, keeping one variable in one term.
  7: Panel regression models used to predict yields under different hypothetical climate
    and pollution scenarios. Dominance analysis to calculate the percentage contributions
    of different factors of interest to the residual of the base model.
  10: Statistical models are developed to predict crop yields, incorporating key factors
    like temperature, precipitation, AOD, and surface ozone. A machine learning model
    is used to address the sparsity of ground-level ozone observations. The models
    are based on historical data and consider time-varying factors like technological
    innovations and policy practices.
  11: The research utilizes statistical models and processed data downloadable from
    a specified repository to analyze the impact of environmental factors on crop
    production. The spatial production allocation model (SPAM) is used for crop spatial
    distribution.
More Notes:
  1: The study highlights a co-benefit of air pollution control policies for agriculture
    but warns that this benefit will diminish as pollution is alleviated and global
    warming persists.
  7: The study focuses on China and the effects of the East Asian Summer Monsoon.
    The year 2010 is considered a tipping point for particulate pollution trends in
    China.
  10: CO2 fertilization effect and nitrogen deposition are mentioned as factors that
    deserve further investigation but are not explicitly modeled for future predictions
    beyond the historical data. The effect of diffuse light fertilization after aerosol
    removal may not be embedded in the historical data.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Crop yield (maize and rice)
  5: Annual production and yields (production per area) of rice, maize, and wheat
    in 31 provinces of China are analyzed.
  7: Crop yield changes (rice, maize, winter wheat) due to climate and pollution factors.
  10: Crop yield (rice, maize, winter wheat) in China, food security.
  11: The study investigates the impact of climate change-related factors (temperature,
    precipitation, aerosols, and surface ozone) on crop yields in China.
Quantitative material:
  1: "During 2010\u20132018, particulate pollution mitigation resulted in 0.5%\u2013\
    1.9% net yield increases nationwide. Future climate change will reduce maize and\
    \ rice yields by 0.6 to 2.8% 10 yr\u22121 by 2050."
  5: Planted fraction (%) of rice, maize, and wheat in 10x10 km cells is mapped. Climatology
    of MERRA2 aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm and surface ozone MDA8 are provided
    for peak growing seasons (2006-2010). Time series of total crop production (Megatonnes),
    AOD, and near-surface ozone for individual crop types during the peak growing
    season (1980-2018) are presented.
  7: Ozone increase of 5 ppbv MDA8 results in significant maize and rice yield reduction,
    with a larger reduction rate for maize; 1 mm precipitation per day results in
    about 5.4% winter wheat yield loss during the growing season; Pollution caused
    a reduction in RYC (Relative Yield Change) of -4.8% for rice, -8.5% for maize,
    and -17.1% for winter wheat from 1980-2010; Climate induced RYC of -1.4% for rice,
    -1.8% for maize, and -1.6% for winter wheat from 1980-2010; Pollution mitigation
    from 2014-2018 compared to 2006-2010 resulted in positive RYC of 1.1% for rice,
    1.3% for maize, and 2.4% for wheat.
