Drivers of Risk:
  8: No relevant information
  10: Decreasing soil moisture availability (drought) across the last 25 years is
    coupled with increasing mortality trends in European forests.
Highlights:
  8: The study uses single-tree ground observations covering the European continent
    to analyze forest mortality.
  10: The study highlights the need for more intensive monitoring programmes and networks
    to accurately evaluate adaptive management strategies for the future, given the
    concerning trend of increasing forest mortality linked to decreasing soil moisture.
Methodology:
  8: Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) were used to analyze forest mortality
    data. The models include varying intercept and varying slope models to account
    for heterogeneity. MCMC chains were used to assess convergence.
  10: Long-term forest monitoring data is used to analyze tree mortality in relation
    to soil moisture.
More Notes:
  8: The page presents statistical models (GLMMs) examining the relationship between
    soil moisture anomaly (SMA) and forest mortality, but doesn't directly link this
    to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level. The models consider
    current-year (cy) and previous-year (py) SMA, as well as their interaction.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  8: No relevant information
  10: Concerns regarding the vitality of European forests due to increasing mortality
    trends.
Quantitative material:
  8: Group-level and population-level effects for varying intercept and varying slope
    models are presented in a table, including coefficient estimates, standard errors,
    confidence intervals (l-95%, u-95%), and convergence diagnostics (Rhat, Bulk ESS,
    Tail ESS). The survival probability ranges from 0.9994 to 1.0000 across the SMA
    values from -4 to 2.
