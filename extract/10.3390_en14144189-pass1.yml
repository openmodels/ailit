Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme climate risks (floods, droughts, tornados, hurricanes, etc.).
  4: Climate risk, measured by the Global Climate Risk Index (GCRI) score (inverted).
  5: Climate risks, specifically extreme weather events, are examined as a key driver
    of changes in energy consumption and socio-economic impacts at the country level.
  8: Climate risk, both short-term and long-term, impacts the transition of energy
    consumption.
  9: Short-term climate risk (CRI), Long-term climate risk (CRI_long)
  11: Climate risk index (CRI) and governance quality (vae, pve, gee, rqe, rle, cce).
  12: Climate risk (CRI and CRI_long), lnpgdp (log of GDP per capita), urbanr (urbanization
    rate), indusr (industrialization rate), trader (trade openness)
  13: Short-term Climate Risk (CRI), Long-term Climate Risk (CRI_long), Fossil energy
    resources, Level of economic development
  14: Climate risk (exposure to extreme weather), business cycle fluctuations (economic
    booms and recessions), oil price fluctuations
  15: Extreme climate risks (floods, heatwaves, long-term droughts); Economic recession;
    Oil price fluctuations
Highlights:
  1: Extreme climate change has promoted the transition of the energy structure, reduced
    the consumption of fossil energy, and increased the consumption of renewable energy.
    Areas with high levels of economic development and coastal countries are more
    inclined to respond to climate change through energy transition. Economic recession
    and falling oil prices will strengthen the correlation between climate risk and
    the global energy transition.
  5: The interaction of climate risk and governance quality potentially affects the
    transition in energy consumption structure; the study explores governance as a
    moderating factor.
  8: Climate risk promotes the transition of energy consumption towards renewable
    energy, with long-term climate risks having a greater impact.
  9: Climate risk (both short and long term) has a significantly positive impact on
    energy consumption transition. Long-term climate risk has a more prominent impact.
    Climate risk (both short and long term) has a negative impact on fossil energy
    consumption.
  11: Governance quality, specifically voice and accountability (vae), political stability
    and absence of violence (pve), government effectiveness (gee), regulatory quality
    (rqe), rule of law (rle), and control of corruption (cce), can moderate the impact
    of climate risk on energy consumption transition.
  12: Climate risk can promote the transition of energy consumption, and this finding
    is robust after controlling for potential endogeneity.
  13: In resource-rich countries, short-term climate risk (CRI) has a significantly
    positive impact on energy consumption transition. Long-term climate risks (CRI_long)
    have a significant positive impact on the energy consumption transition of both
    resource-rich and resource-poor countries. In countries with low levels of economic
    development, both short-term and long-term climate risks have a significantly
    positive impact on energy consumption transition.
  14: Climate risk significantly promotes the transition of energy consumption in
    low-income countries, but not in high-income countries. During economic recessions,
    climate risk promotes energy consumption transition. The positive correlation
    between climate risk and energy consumption transition is more pronounced when
    oil prices are falling.
  15: Countries facing higher climate risks are more likely to develop renewable energy
    sources. National governance quality can weaken the promotion effect of climate
    risks on the transition of energy consumption. The relationship between climate
    risks and energy consumption transition is more significant in countries with
    rich resources and low levels of economic development. The relationship between
    climate risks and energy consumption transition is more significant when affected
    by economic recession and falling oil price fluctuations.
Methodology:
  1: Panel data model with fixed effects.
  4: Spatial panel model with fixed effects.
  5: The study employs a panel data model incorporating climate risk index scores
    and governance quality indicators using data from 2006 to 2019 for 101 countries/regions.
  8: Utilizes an augmented Dickey-Fuller test for stability and correlation analysis
    to assess the impact of climate risk on energy consumption transition.
  9: Fixed-effects model; Hausman test indicates fixed-effects model is better than
    random-effects.
  11: Panel data regression analysis with country and year fixed effects. The analysis
    examines the moderating effect of governance quality on the relationship between
    climate risk and energy consumption transition.
  12: The instrumental variable method is used to address endogeneity, using coastline
    length (lncoastline) as an instrument for climate risk. Two-stage least squares
    regression is employed. The results include country and year fixed effects.
  13: Regression analysis with country and year fixed effects, performed on sub-samples
    based on median fossil energy production (resource-rich/poor) and economic development
    level (high/low).
  14: Regression analysis on sub-samples of countries divided by GDP per capita, economic
    cycle (boom/recession), and oil price trends (rise/fall). The results are applicable
    to understanding the relationship between climate risk and energy consumption
    transition under varying economic and external conditions.
  15: Panel data analysis of 101 countries from 2006 to 2019, using country-level
    data. Regression analysis with control variables, country fixed effects, and year
    fixed effects. Instrumental variable method used to address endogeneity.
More Notes:
  1: The climate risk index constructed by Germanwatch is used.
  9: The study uses lagged climate risk variables. The control variables (GDP per
    capita, urbanization, industrialization, and trade) also impact energy consumption
    transition.
  11: The paper argues that better governance can lead to more proactive and effective
    energy policies, reducing the reliance on experiencing extreme climate events
    to drive changes in energy consumption structure. The moderating effects vary
    across different dimensions of governance.
  12: The study uses data from a sample of countries. The data source for coastline
    length is ChartsBin, accessed on 10 July 2021.
  13: The paper defines resource-rich/poor based on the median production of fossil
    energy (crude oil, coal, natural gas).
  14: The paper argues that economic growth during boom periods can compensate for
    losses from climate risk, hindering the energy transition. Industrial policies
    and environmental regulations adopted during recessions might stimulate renewable
    energy consumption.
