Drivers of Risk:
  4: Changes in temperature and humidity impacting labor supply in MENA region.
  6: Changes in temperature, humidity, and precipitation.
  8: Changes in meteorological indicators (temperature, humidity); Sea level rise;
    Heat extremes
  9: Maximum temperature and relative humidity per governorate, potentially leading
    to 'Discomfort / Risk Zones'.
  10: Climate indicators (changes in temperature, humidity, and precipitation).
  12: Temperature, humidity, and precipitation changes.
  13: Climate variability (specifically, maximum temperature)
  15: Temperature and humidity are identified as drivers of risk. Precipitation is
    also examined, but found to have no significant impact.

Highlights:
  4: Changes in temperature and humidity significantly impact labor working hours
    with different effects between high-risk and low-risk groups.
  6: Increased temperatures during summers decrease the marginal utility of working.
    The impact of temperature increases is non-linear, with colder temperatures initially
    leading to increased work hours. The effect of increasing temperatures on working
    hours differs between 'high-risk' and 'low-risk' groups.
  8: "Some Mediterranean coastal governorates \u2013 namely Damietta and Port Said\
    \ in Egypt, Nabeula, Sousse, and Tunis in Tunisia, and Madaba in Jordan \u2013\
    \ are particularly vulnerable and experiencing more risk than other governorates\
    \ in their respective countries"
  9: Identifies 'Discomfort / Risk Zones' in Lebanon, Egypt, and Jordan.
  12: The study aims to estimate the impact of temperature, humidity, and precipitation
    on labor supply, differentiating between high-risk and low-risk occupations.
  13: Climate variability impacts labor supply; negative binomial regression is the
    preferred model.
  15: High-risk groups (e.g., agriculture, mining) are more sensitive to temperature
    and humidity changes than low-risk groups. Humidity significantly impacts labor
    hours in high-risk groups, but not in low-risk groups. High-risk labor hours are
    reduced significantly when the heat index is in the danger or extreme danger zone.
  17: Weekly average maximum temperature and relative humidity have statistically
    significant effects (p < 0.001) on the outcome variable across all three regression
    models. The direction of the effects varies, with temperature having a positive
    linear and negative quadratic impact, while humidity has a negative linear and
    positive quadratic impact. Age and gender are also strong predictors.
  18: The table displays statistically significant constant terms (p < 0.01) in the
    regressions, with associated t-statistics. The number of observations for all
    regressions is 23,521. AIC and BIC values are provided for two of the columns.
  19: Weekly average maximum temperature and temperature squared are statistically
    significant in all models. Age, Gender, and Education levels are statistically
    significant in most models, indicating they are important factors related to the
    outcome variable.
  20: Household wealth score has a statistically significant positive relationship
    with the outcome variable (unspecified on this page) across all three regression
    models.
  21: Important factors include temperature, humidity, age, gender, and education
    level impacting labor working hours.
  22: Both the 'High-Risk Group' and 'Low-Risk Group' exhibit a parabolic relationship
    between weekly average maximum temperature and linear prediction (likely of hours
    worked), peaking around 35 degrees, suggesting a negative impact on hours worked
    beyond this temperature.
  24: Inverse relationship between relative humidity and labor working hours is observed
    only in the case of high-risk groups. Temperature at which labor working hours
    are maximized differs between high- and low-risk labor groups.
  26: Several studies examine the impact of temperature on productivity and labor
    supply in different countries (Egypt, South Africa, India, Japan, United States).
Methodology:
  4: Data from Integrated Labor Market Panel Surveys for Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia (2006-2018)
    matched with climate data to assess impact on labor working hours.
  6: Uses unbalanced longitudinal survey data and spatial daily climate indicators.
    Regression models are conducted separately for 'high-risk' and 'low-risk' groups.
    Assumes individuals allocate time between working and non-working activities.
  8: exploit the spatial and temporal variation in observations to capture the impact
    of changes in meteorological indicators on the number of hours worked by respondents
    per week
  9: The maps use data from NOAA CPC Global and NASA POWER. The analysis appears to
    be based on identifying 'Discomfort / Risk Zones' based on temperature and humidity.
  10: The study uses count models, specifically Poisson regression, to analyze the
    impact of climate indicators on labor supply, controlling for socioeconomic and
    demographic variables. The model estimates the expected number of hours worked
    per week for an individual based on climate and other factors. The coefficients
    are estimated using maximum likelihood.
  11: The study uses Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models to analyze the
    impact of climate variables on hours of work, based on matched ILMPSs (Integrated
    Labor Market Panel Surveys) for Egypt, Jordan, and Tunisia, along with geographically
    gridded daily climate measures. The negative binomial model is preferred when
    the equidispersion assumption of the Poisson model is violated.
  12: Regression analysis using spatial and temporal variation in climate data to
    identify the causal impact of climate on labor supply. Workers are divided into
    high-risk and low-risk groups based on their occupation's exposure to climate.
    The analysis controls for individual-level characteristics, wealth score, month
    of interview fixed effects, governorate fixed effects, and year fixed effects.
  13: The study uses Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Poisson regression with robust
    standard errors, and negative binomial regressions to examine the impact of climate
    variability on labor supply; Negative binomial regression is preferred due to
    overdispersion of data, and lower AIC and BIC compared to Poisson regression.
    Results are applicable to Egypt (2006, 2012, 2018), Jordan (2016), and Tunisia
    (2014).
  15: The analysis controls for climate variables (temperature, humidity, precipitation)
    and demographic/socioeconomic indicators. Average marginal effects are calculated
    to assess the impact of humidity. The impact of the NOAA heat index (combination
    of temperature and humidity) is also examined.
  17: OLS, Poisson, and Negative Binomial regressions are used to model the relationship
    between climate variables, socio-economic variables, and the outcome of interest
    for a 'high-risk' group. The table presents coefficient estimates and t-statistics.
    The results are applicable at a weekly level.
  18: The analysis uses regressions, including a Poisson regression in Column (2)
    with robust standard errors. All regressions control for the month and year of
    visit and governorate of the respondent. The reference group for education levels
    is Illiterate.
  19: The analysis uses Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Poisson, and Negative Binomial
    regression models. The coefficients represent the estimated change in the (unspecified)
    outcome variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, controlling
    for other variables in the model. Significance levels are indicated by asterisks
    (***, **).
  20: Three regression models are used, including a Poisson regression in Column (2)
    which uses robust standard errors to correct for overdispersion. All regressions
    control for the month and year of visit and governorate of the respondent.
  21: Analysis performed using negative binomial regression on labor working hours
    influenced by climatic factors.
  22: Regression analysis is used to model the relationship between temperature and
    hours worked, controlling for the month and year of visit and governorate of the
    respondent. Predicted margins and 95% confidence intervals are presented graphically.
  24: Poisson and Negative Binomial regressions. Matching monthly climatology variables
    (monthly long-term mean maximum temperature, temperature, precipitation, and relative
    humidity) with ILMPS dataset. Monthly climatic normals are calculated by NASA
    POWER over the period 1/1/1984 to 31/12/2013.
  26: El-Raey et al. (1999) focuses on adaptation strategies; Shayegh et al. (2020)
    models the impact of rising temperatures; Somanathan et al. (2015) examines the
    impact of temperature on productivity and labor supply; Takakura et al. (2018)
    examines the role of working time shift to offset heat exposure occupational health
    costs; Zivin and Neidell (2014) look at the allocation of time given temperature
    changes.
