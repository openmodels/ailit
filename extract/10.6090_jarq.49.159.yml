Drivers of Risk:
  1: Long and heavy rain and flooding affect rice productivity in Japan, and these
    events are expected to increase with climate change.
  3: Heavy rain, specifically long-rain and flooding
  5: Heavy rainfall during August and September.
  6: Differences in socioeconomic factors and climate conditions
  7: Heavy rain, represented by the Long Rain Index (CRI) and Flood Index (CFI); Solar
    radiation in July, August and September (SR7, SR8, SR9); Maximum daily temperature
    in July, August, and September (TM7, TM8, TM9); Average minimum daily temperature
    during July and August (TL78)
  9: Heavy rain, long rain periods, temperature changes, and flooding.
  10: Long-term climate change affects rice TFP by reducing production amount via
    temperature indices (CHI, CQI, CFI) and increasing costs via flooding (CRI).
  11: Heavy rain, long rain, floods, and temperature changes due to climate change
  12: Climate data (temperature and solar radiation) impacting crop yield and quality.
Highlights:
  1: Rain impacts on TFP fluctuations exceed temperature's impact due to significant
    variations in annual rainfall, despite low elasticity against rain.
  3: Climate factors influence rice TFP through changes in harvest quantity, quality,
    and drainage situations
  5: The relationship between maximum rainfall and outflow/rice productivity varies
    across prefectures, as captured by the regression equations.
  6: Northern regions had higher rice productivity than southern regions due to socioeconomic
    factors and climate. Rice TFP generally increased from 1979 to 2010.
  7: Heavy rain indices (CRI and CFI) and temperature influence rice TFP and CQI.
  9: Northern Japan prefectures initially benefit from temperature increases via crop
    yield (CHI) but later experience negative effects. Southern prefectures consistently
    show negative effects of temperature via crop yield. Temperature effects are multiplicative
    with yield and quality indices if exceeding the threshold. Long rain (CRI) impacts
    rice TFP through poorly drained surface water.
  11: Rainfall negatively impacts rice TFP, with heavy rain/floods decreasing TFP
    by 2.5-4.5%. The impact of rainfall on TFP fluctuations is greater than that of
    temperature, despite lower elasticity, due to higher annual rainfall variation.
  12: Temperature (TM7, TM8, TM9) and solar radiation (SR7, SR8) are significant factors
    influencing crop yield and quality. Extreme temperature variations and rapid drops
    in yield also have significant impacts.
Methodology:
  1: "The impacts are evaluated using panel data regression analysis, utilizing T\xF6\
    rnqvist-Theil and Malmquist indices to measure TFP."
  3: Regression analysis (log-linear type) with climate factors, economies of scale,
    R&D investments, and population density to model rice TFP; DEA is used to calculate
    TFP
  5: Panel data regression models were used to estimate regional differences in rice
    TFP and eliminate latent factors. Data covered 38 prefectures and 31 years (1979-2010,
    excluding 1993). Future climate conditions were drawn from downscaled outputs
    of the MIROC global-climate model using the A1B greenhouse gas emission scenario.
  6: Calculated rice TFP using T-index and M-index; examined chronological changes
    in rice TFP by region.
  7: The analysis estimates Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and Crop Quality Index
    (CQI) functions. Crop growth and crop quality models are used to estimate CHI*
    and CQI*, respectively. Fixed-effect models are used with actual climate conditions
    to estimate CHI* and CQI*.
  9: The study estimates the elasticity of TFP with respect to explanatory variables
    (climate factors). TFP elasticities were calculated with respect to temperature
    via yield (CHI) and quality (CQI), and with respect to rain via poorly drained
    surface water (CRI) and flooding (CFI).
  10: Uses Model 1 (T-index) and Model 3 (M-index) alongside MIROC forecast results
    to analyze the chronological changes in rice TFP.
  11: Panel data analysis, estimated causality function associated with crop-yield,
    crop-quality and hydrological models, future levels of rice TFP were predicted
    by using the projection results of MIROC.
  12: Panel data analysis with fixed-effect and random-effect models. Hausman test
    used to determine the superior model.
More Notes:
  3: The paper seeks to isolate the impact of climate factors on rice TFP by constructing
    climate indexes (CHI, CQI, CRI, CFI) based only on climate conditions to avoid
    endogeneity issues
  5: The data includes actual rainfall during August and September, a hydrological
    model, prefectural codes and economic data.
  6: Analysis excludes 9 prefectures due to lack of data for rice production.
  7: TFP is presented using two indices, T-index and M-index. The analysis focuses
    on rice production in Japan. Fig. 4 shows rice TFPs by regions.
  9: Elasticity of TFP with respect to temperature via yield differed depending on
    the prefecture and year. The estimation values differed slightly due to differences
    in regional classifications and the variables used.
  10: Influences of climate factors vary by region, with northern Japan like Hokkaido
    and Akita less affected by temperature increases.
  11: The study suggests consolidating drainage systems in fields as an adaptation
    strategy and government support is needed.
  12: The study focuses on rice production in Japan. The models estimate crop yield
    (CHI) and quality (CQI) based on temperature and solar radiation variables. The
    time frame of the data is limited to 1979-2010.

    using the perpetual-inventory (PI) method.
  5: CFI values are provided for different prefectures based on maximum rainfall (mm/day),
    along with regression equations relating CFI to rainfall (e.g., CFI=-0.85+0.055
    Rain for Hokkaido).
  6: Correlation coefficients of rice TFP indices exceeded 0.7 for 27 prefectures
    (but lower for others)
  7: Table 1 provides descriptive statistics (average and standard deviation) for
    Rice TFP (T-index and M-index), CQI, CRI, CFI, Solar Radiation (SR7, SR8, SR9),
    Maximum Daily Temperature (TM7, TM8, TM9), Average Minimum Temperature (TL78),
    and other variables like management area per farm household (MA), knowledge capital
    (KKn, KKp) and population density (POP).
  9: Elasticity values for TFP with respect to temperature (via crop-yield index (CHI)
    and crop-quality index (CQI)) and rainfall (via long rain index (CRI) and flood
    index (CFI)) are shown in Figures 5, 6, and 7, respectively. Economies of scale
    (MA) elasticities are 0.29-0.36. CHI elasticities are similar to MA elasticities.
  10: TFP elasticity against heavy rain via flooding (CFI) is less than -0.02 and
    TFP elasticity against surface water (CRI) is -0.044.
  11: Heavy rain and floods decrease rice TFP by 2.5 to 4.5%. Absolute TFP elasticity
    against rain was lower than that against temperature. The influences of rain on
    TFP fluctuations exceeded those of temperature via yield and quality.

    38 regions and 31 years (1979-1992, 1994-2010). Table A2 shows estimations of
    a crop-quality model (CQI) using the same panel data.
