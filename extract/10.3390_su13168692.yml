Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change; Population growth; Conventional policy approaches neglecting
    marginal areas.
  2: "Populations living on less-favored agricultural lands cope with major poverty\u2013\
    environment traps due to low productivity and resource degradation, lack of access\
    \ to markets and infrastructure, and overuse of environmental resources."
  9: Biophysical and socio-economic constraints, climate change, biodiversity loss,
    environmental degradation, technological issues.
  14: Marginal areas are influenced by variable climate and biodiversity, erosion,
    salinization, and waterlogging.
Highlights:
  1: Conventional policy approaches towards marginal agriculture have been conducive
    to favorable areas, neglecting marginal areas. Future policies must evolve around
    an all-inclusive but context-specific framework and prioritize investments geographically.
    Policy instruments should encourage long-term solutions to enhance productivity
    through regenerative production systems and preserve the environmental resource
    base.
  2: Marginality is not a static and permanent condition; investments in technologies
    and proper management practices can transform unproductive lands into productive
    lands. Marginal areas offer territorial advantages for alternative models of development.
  9: Investments in R&D in marginal areas may give higher aggregate social returns
    than investments in high-potential areas.
  14: Understanding agricultural marginality is crucial for future productivity and
    policy development, with potential higher social returns to investment in these
    areas.
Methodology:
  1: "Review of historical policies towards marginal areas to pinpoint shortcomings\
    \ and develop a policy framework for the food\u2013poverty\u2013environment nexus."
  2: No relevant information
  9: Economic valuation of environmental impacts, poverty mapping, GIS techniques
    and spatially referenced datasets to define and map less-favored areas.
  14: The paper conducts a systematic review and summarizes findings in a table for
    guiding future research and policy priorities.
More Notes:
  1: The paper advocates for a transformation from sustainable intensification to
    a regenerative and self-sustaining approach to agriculture.
  2: The page focuses on poverty and food security in marginal agricultural areas
    and the potential for development through technology and policy changes.
  9: Marginality is a dynamic concept, and can be overcome with targeted interventions.
    Research should focus on neglected and under-utilized crops and livestock species
    in marginal environments.
  14: Marginal areas have historically been neglected which poses challenges for sustainable
    development and high-input food production.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Food security in agriculturally marginal areas; Poverty reduction; Preservation
    of biodiversity; Restoration of marginal lands.
  2: No relevant information
  9: Productivity and poverty problems; food security.
  14: No explicit mention of specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
Quantitative material:
  2: No relevant information
  9: Investments in R&D in marginal areas may give higher aggregate social returns
    to a nation than additional investments in high-potential and prime areas.
  14: Marginal areas make up 15% of current agricultural lands and 21% of total global
    land resources. Nearly 1/3 of the world's rural population lives in marginal areas.
