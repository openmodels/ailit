Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change induced flood events.
  3: River flooding and drainage congestion during the monsoon, potentially influenced
    by upstream interventions.
  4: Higher than anticipated construction costs, loss of soil fertility over time,
    higher waterlogging damages, and negative impact on capture fisheries.
  8: Flooding (implied by embankment presence and analysis of migration/movement),
    proximity to infrastructure (hospitals, gas lines, pipelines, deep tubewells).
  11: Flooding (riverine and rainfall-induced waterlogging). Embankment construction
    and breaches as mitigation efforts that then influence risk.
  14: Floods, human interventions (embankments), climate change (implicitly).
Highlights:
  1: No significantly higher benefits accruing to those living with higher levels
    of flood protection.
  3: "Machine learning provides robust metrics to evaluate the impacts of interventions,\
    \ identifying informative indicators in flood management. The Meghna\u2013Dhonagoda\
    \ Irrigation Project (MDIP) is one of the largest flood control, drainage, and\
    \ irrigation projects in Bangladesh."
  4: The embankment led to a net welfare loss and negative distributional outcomes.
  5: Machine learning can provide analytical insights from detailed historical data
    on long-term impacts from climate resilient infrastructure to help guide future
    policy and investments.
  8: Embankments may lead to short-term increases in agricultural land ownership for
    inside residents, but differences may even out over time. Proximity to infrastructure
    may have larger socio-economic impacts than living inside/outside the embankment.
  11: Embankment construction led to an initial increase in inward movement. After
    construction, in-migration rate to the area outside the embankment increased.
    Embankment protected the project area from inundation during the 1998 flood, despite
    it exceeding the 100-year flood level. Mortality rates did not differ significantly
    inside vs. outside the embankment.
  14: The study's methods can evaluate environmental and socio-economic impacts of
    human interventions beyond the context of Bangladesh; The study reinforces findings
    around the immediate impacts of embankments, but finds those are not continued
    three decades later; Machine learning approaches can be used to identify the most
    informative variables for developmental interventions.
Methodology:
  1: Machine learning is used to analyze socio-economic survey and events data (death,
    migration) from 1983-2014 to assess the impact of flood protection embankments.
  3: "Machine learning is used to evaluate the impacts of interventions and identify\
    \ informative indicators, using an existing dataset from the Meghna\u2013Dhonagoda\
    \ Irrigation Project (MDIP). The methodology is applicable where there is robust\
    \ historic continuous data."
  4: The analysis used HDSS data, socio-economic surveys, and comparisons between
    areas inside and outside the embankment, but findings on welfare differences were
    inconclusive; a recommendation was made for a follow-up study with longer-term
    data.
  5: Machine learning approaches are used to analyze multi-decadal socio-economic
    and event data to evaluate the long-term impact of embankments (climate resilient
    infrastructure). Classification models are used to identify differences in socio-economic
    status of households inside vs. outside the embankment. Regression models are
    used to assess differences in mortality and migration patterns inside vs. outside
    the embankment.
  8: Analysis of socio-economic survey data and event data (birth, marriage, divorce,
    death, migration, movement) using ROC comparison and variable ranking based on
    importance.
  11: Analysis of migration and mortality data inside vs. outside embankment, alongside
    hydro-climatic data (flood inundation areas using LANDSAT images and NDWI).
  14: Machine-learning approaches integrating socio-economic, hydro-climatic data,
    and data on public/private water infrastructure; Spatio-temporal analysis; Quantitative
    analysis of embankment impacts using machine learning to identify relevant indicators.
More Notes:
  1: Focuses on social impacts and does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    aspects of climate change adaptation.
  3: "The Meghna\u2013Dhonagoda Irrigation Project (MDIP) was implemented in 1988.\
    \ The study focuses on Matlab North, protected by embankments from the Meghna\
    \ and Dhonagoda Rivers."
  4: The variables related to impacts were not consistently monitored over time, limiting
    longer-term impact assessments.
  5: The study focuses on identifying socio-economic indicators impacted by the embankment,
    using household survey data to classify households inside or outside the embankment.
  8: The study normalizes event counts by mid-year population and uses data from 31
    years.
  11: "The analysis links socio-economic impacts with hydro-climatic events. The area\
    \ within Matlab North used to be regularly flooded in the monsoon uptoadepthof\
    \ 2\u20133m in the pre-project condition. The effectiveness of the embankment\
    \ is highlighted by its ability to withstand floods after repairs, although waterlogging\
    \ remains an issue."
  14: The study found that households inside the embankment owned a larger proportion
    of agricultural land within a decade of its construction, but this difference
    appears to be evening out in recent years; The paper suggests the framework can
    be adapted to identify key variables, e.g., those indicative of owning a deep
    tubewell, using solar panels, or contracting certain water-borne diseases.

  10: This page primarily focuses on socio-economic survey data analysis at a local
    level (bari) in Bangladesh, specifically related to water sources, land ownership,
    and proximity to services. There is no information on macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes, costs/benefits of adaptation at a national level, or any discussion
    of macroeconomic drivers of risk.
  18: No relevant information
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No significant difference found between populations inside vs. outside flood
    embankments based on welfare, migration, or mortality indicators.
  3: Improvement of agricultural conditions in monsoon, specifically encouraging introduction
    to high yielding variety (HYV) monsoon rice (Aman), and providing irrigation from
    surface water in the Rabi (dry) season and early monsoon seasons.
  4: The embankment resulted in negative distributional outcomes, with big landowners
    benefiting from increased agricultural production while traditional fishermen
    and river transport workers faced negative impacts.
  8: Socio-economic benefits and stability (measured by migration, movement, and death
    rates), agricultural land ownership.
  11: No information on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. Focuses on migration, mortality,
    and inundation.
  14: Socio-economic well-being, mortality, migration, agricultural land ownership,
    water-borne disease morbidity, malnutrition in children.
Quantitative material:
  1: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal data presented on this page.

    comparing AUC metrics across years.
  11: Mentions inundation depth (2-3m pre-project), flood return periods (1-in-100-year),
    in-migration rates, and mortality rates, but does not provide specific figures.
  14: The study mentions using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes to indirectly assess water-borne
    disease morbidity, but states that the results showed no significant difference
    in inside/outside population.
