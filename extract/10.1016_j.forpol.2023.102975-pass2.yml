Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change-induced natural disturbances such as storms and insect outbreaks
    are impacting European forests.
  2: Supply shocks through salvage logging after a disturbance (windthrow event or
    bark beetle outbreak) and price fluctuation through demand changes impact roundwood
    prices.
  3: Demand shocks for wood-based products (e.g., sawnwood) increases roundwood (e.g.,
    sawlogs) demand and price.
  4: Demand shocks (product unit values, xt1) and supply shocks (salvage logging,
    xt5) are the primary drivers of risk.
  6: Disturbance shocks (e.g., windthrow events), supply shocks (e.g., due to disturbances
    affecting high grades of sawlogs), demand shocks, salvage logging volumes, wood
    imports/exports, assortment shares (proportion of different types of wood harvested).
Highlights:
  1: Disturbances tend to increase domestic sawlog prices, suggesting a shortage of
    high-quality wood; supply shocks decrease pulpwood prices.
  2: The study identifies predictors of roundwood price resilience with respect to
    supply and demand shocks and examines how their effect varies across national
    forest-based value chains in Europe.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Demand shocks are positively associated with sawlog prices in some countries.
    Supply shocks can have both positive and negative effects on sawlog prices. Roundwood
    imports/exports can influence sawlog prices. Pulpwood market seems more resilient
    due to a broader industry raw material base.
  6: Disturbance shocks can lead to increased sawlog prices due to shortages in high-grade
    sawlogs. Voluntary logging can mitigate sawlog price increases after supply shocks.
    Roundwood exports can contribute to value chain resilience by alleviating supply
    and demand shocks. Roundwood imports can amplify the impact of demand shocks.
Methodology:
  1: An econometric analysis was conducted focusing on five European countries (Austria,
    Czechia, Germany, Finland, and Sweden) using annual time series data on salvage
    logging, forest products production and trade, and roundwood prices.
  2: A time series econometric model is employed for two forest-based value chains
    (saw milling, pulp milling) in five EU countries (Austria, Czechia, Germany, Finland
    and Sweden).
  3: OLS (ordinary least squares) estimation of the effect of potential
  4: OLS regression with AIC model selection is used to estimate the impact of demand
    and supply shocks, and moderating factors (roundwood imports/exports, voluntary/salvage
    logging, share of roundwood use). The model uses first differences of log-transformed
    data to ensure stationarity. Armington elasticities are also estimated via OLS.
  6: Econometric analysis of sawlog and pulpwood prices in relation to various factors,
    examining significance levels, signs, and magnitudes of relationships. Applicable
    to countries with sufficient data on roundwood prices and logging volumes.
More Notes:
  2: Disturbances are expected to cause short-term oversupply and price reductions
    in domestic roundwood supply, primarily affecting forest owners. Demand shocks
    can cause short-term shortages and price spikes in domestic roundwood supply,
    negatively impacting consumers.
  3: The paper examines the expected effects of various explanatory variables on roundwood
    prices, considering both demand and supply side factors.
  4: Interaction terms are included to account for the moderating nature of reactions
    on demand and supply shocks. Diagnostic tests are used to check for serial correlation,
    normality, homoscedasticity, and model specification.
  6: The study acknowledges limitations due to the low number of observations per
    country. It suggests that market dynamics at the national level, as measured by
    sawlog and pulpwood prices, have not been heavily affected by disturbance shocks
    in the last two decades, potentially due to localized effects and adjustments
    in the domestic market.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Short-term price stability of roundwood is critical for the functioning of forest-based
    value chains.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Domestic roundwood price (yt) is the outcome of interest.
  6: Sawlog and pulpwood prices, as indicators of market dynamics at the national
    level.
Quantitative material:
  3: No relevant information
  4: "The model is log-log, allowing coefficients to be interpreted as elasticities\
    \ (e.g., a 1% increase in x_1 increases y_t by \u03B2_1%). Armington elasticities\
    \ are calculated, measuring the substitutability between domestic and imported\
    \ roundwood."
  6: Austrian sawlog prices are affected by sawnwood prices (coefficient 0.52) and
    salvage logging volumes (coefficient -0.08).
