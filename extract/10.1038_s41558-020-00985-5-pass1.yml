Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increases in seasonally adjusted day-to-day temperature variability.
  2: Day-to-day temperature variability (measured as intra-monthly standard deviation
    of daily temperature)
  3: Day-to-day temperature variability, seasonal temperature difference, annual average
    temperature level, annual average temperature change, and total annual precipitation.
  4: Day-to-day temperature variability and seasonal temperature differences are identified
    as key drivers of risk.
  5: Changes in day-to-day temperature variability and its interaction with seasonal
    temperature differences.
  6: Day-to-day temperature variability
  8: Annual aggregate of day-to-day temperature variability.
  10: Day-to-day temperature variability
  12: A 1 degree increase of day-to-day temperature variability
Highlights:
  1: Day-to-day temperature variability has a newly identified impact on macro-economic
    growth separate from annual average temperature changes.
  2: Day-to-day temperature variability has a negative linear effect on regional growth
    rates.
  3: Day-to-day temperature variability has a statistically significant negative impact
    on regional growth rates. The impact of day-to-day temperature variability on
    regional growth rates varies geographically, with larger reductions in regions
    with small seasonal temperature differences (strong latitudinal dependence).  Based
    on adjusted R^2 and BIC, model 7 is selected as the preferred specification.
  4: The effect of day-to-day variability in winter on annual regional growth rates
    is statistically insignificant and of negligible magnitude.
  5: Higher income regions have stronger adaptation response to seasonal temperature
    differences compared to lower income regions.
  6: "Day-to-day temperature variability constitutes a previously unidentified impact\
    \ channel of considerable magnitude in the climate\u2013economy relationship."
  8: Day-to-day temperature variability has a negative effect on economic growth,
    and this effect is dependent on the average regional seasonal temperature difference.
  10: Regions which are accustomed to smaller seasonal temperature differences suffer
    greater marginal losses (greater negative marginal changes) from a 1 degree increase
    of day-to-day temperature variability.
  12: The difference between the response of high- and low-income regions to temperature
    variability is not significant, although above-median income regions generally
    experience smaller marginal losses.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis performed using fixed-effects panel models combining observed day-to-day
    temperature variability with subnational economic data for 1,537 regions worldwide
    over 40 years.
  2: Fixed-effects panel regression models to exploit within-region changes of day-to-day
    temperature variability and regional growth from one year to the next, controlling
    for contemporaneous global shocks, omitted biases between regions, and region-specific
    trends.
  3: Panel regression models are used to estimate the effect of climate variables
    on regional growth rates. Standard errors are clustered at the regional level.
    The analysis uses regional data and likely applies to the time period included
    in the panel data.  Model 7 is selected as the preferred specification based on
    adjusted R-squared and BIC.
  4: Robustness tests include using different climate re-analysis datasets, weighting
    climate data by population, including region-specific time trends, and excluding
    major economies/industries.
  5: Partitioning of data by median national income; regression analysis with error
    clustering by country and year to evaluate the impact of temperature variability.
  6: Econometric specification analysis.
  8: Fixed-effects panel regression models are applied to regional economic data from
    1,537 regions in 76 countries spanning 1979-2018, controlling for regional and
    yearly fixed effects, average seasonal temperature difference, annual average
    temperature, annual average temperature change, and yearly total precipitation.

More Notes:
  2: The magnitude of the effect of day-to-day temperature variability is modulated
    by the seasonal temperature difference. Countries with smaller seasonal temperature
    differences are more affected by changes in day-to-day temperature variability.
    The effect of day-to-day temperature variability is independent of changes in
    annual average temperature.
  3: The paper suggests that the negative effect of day-to-day temperature variability
    on growth may be due to either the damaging effects of variability or nonlinearities
    in the response to weather variables.
  5: Vulnerability distribution indicates greater marginal losses in low-latitude
    and coastal regions.
  6: Spill-over effects may potentially attenuate or aggravate these effects, but
    a thorough assessment of their role requires explicit assessment of the trade,
    financial and infrastructure networks through which they may propagate, which
    is beyond the scope of the work.
  8: The study uses ERA5, WFDEI, and EWEMBI reanalysis datasets for climate data and
    the GADM database for regional boundaries. The aggregation of climate data to
    the regional level is area-weighted or population weighted.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Reductions in macro-economic growth rates due to increased seasonally adjusted
    day-to-day temperature variability.
  2: Regional growth rates (measured as the first difference of the logarithm of gross
    regional product)
  3: Regional growth rates
  4: Marginal change in growth rate (percentage points) is used as a measure of macroeconomic
    outcome.
  5: Marginal losses from day-to-day temperature variability generally larger in low-income
    nations.
  6: Economic growth effects at a national level
  8: Growth rate of gross regional product (percentage-point change).
  10: Regional economic growth rates
  12: Regional growth rates
Quantitative material:
  1: An extra degree of variability results in a five percentage-point reduction in
    regional growth rates on average, with the highest vulnerability in low-latitude,
    low-income regions experiencing a twelve percentage-point reduction.
  2: An extra degree Celsius of day-to-day temperature variability in a given year
    and region reduces the regional growth rate by at least five percentage points.
  3: Table 1 shows regression results for the effect of climate variables on regional
    growth rates. For example, in model (1), a one-unit increase in day-to-day temperature
    variability is associated with a -0.0538 percentage point change in regional growth
    rates (significant at p<0.001).  Column (7) is the preferred model.
  4: Figure 3 plots marginal change in growth rate (percentage points) against Country
    GDP per capita (2017 US$) with the size of points indicating population and color
    denoting average seasonal temperature difference.
  5: Historical deviations of day-to-day temperature variability from regional means
    have significant economic impact.
  6: "Day-to-day temperature variability of 0.2\xB0C translates to economic growth\
    \ effects of approximately one percentage point under the central econometric\
    \ specification."
  8: The paper uses fixed-effects panel regression models to estimate the effect of
    day-to-day temperature variability on economic growth (measured as the first difference
    of the logarithm of gross regional product).
