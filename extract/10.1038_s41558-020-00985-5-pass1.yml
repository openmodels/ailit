Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increases in seasonally adjusted day-to-day temperature variability.
  2: Day-to-day temperature variability
  3: "Day-to-day temperature variability (T), seasonal temperature difference (T),\
    \ annual average temperature level (T), annual average temperature change (\u03B4\
    T), and total annual precipitation (P) are considered as drivers of risk to regional\
    \ growth rates."
  4: Day-to-day temperature variability
  5: Day-to-day temperature variability is a driver of risk, with increases leading
    to marginal losses in economic growth. Seasonal temperature differences, and national
    income, also mediate the risk of day-to-day temperature variability.
  6: The driver of risk is day-to-day temperature variability.

    \ temperature difference (T^r), annual average temperature (T), annual average\
    \ temperature change (\u03B4T), yearly total precipitation (P)."

Evaluation overview:
  1: Macro-economic growth.
  2: Regional economic growth rates
  3: Regional growth rates are being evaluated.

    economic growth rates.

    growth.

    product.
  9: Economic growth is evaluated.
  10: Regional economic growth rates
  12: Regional growth rates
Highlights:
  1: Increases in seasonally adjusted day-to-day temperature variability reduce macro-economic
    growth independent of and in addition to changes in annual average temperature.
  2: Day-to-day temperature variability has a negative linear effect on regional growth
    rates.
  3: Model (7) in Table 1 is selected as the preferred specification based on adjusted
    R2 and BIC. Figure 2 indicates the effect of an extra degree of day-to-day temperature
    variability on regional growth rates varies geographically, with a larger reduction
    in regions that experience small seasonal temperature differences.
  4: The reduction in regional growth rates per extra degree of day-to-day temperature
    variability is larger in countries with lower GDP per capita. Day-to-day temperature
    variability in spring, summer, and autumn has significant effects on annual regional
    growth rates. Day-to-day temperature variability in winter is statistically insignificant.
  5: Lower-income regions are more vulnerable to increases in day-to-day temperature
    variability due to their low income. The negative impacts of greater day-to-day
    temperature variability are not fully recovered in the medium term. Higher income
    enables regions to better utilize their exposure to large historical seasonal
    temperature differences to adapt to the effects of greater day-to-day variability.
  6: The paper identifies day-to-day temperature variability as a previously unidentified
    impact channel of considerable magnitude in the climate-economy relationship.
  10: Regions which are accustomed to smaller seasonal temperature differences suffer
    greater marginal losses (greater negative marginal changes) from a 1 degree increase
    of day-to-day temperature variability.
  12: The difference between the response of high- and low-income regions is not significant,
    although above-median income regions generally experience smaller marginal losses.
Methodology:
  1: Fixed-effects panel models combining observed day-to-day temperature variability
    with subnational economic data for 1,537 regions worldwide over 40 years.
  2: Fixed-effects panel regression models to exploit within-region changes of day-to-day
    temperature variability and regional growth from one year to the next using ERA5
    climate data (1979-2018) combined with regional economic data.
  3: Panel regression models are used to estimate the effect of climate variables
    on regional growth rates. Standard errors are clustered at the regional level.
    Models incorporate region and year. The best performing model is selected based
    on adjusted R2 and BIC.
  4: "Regression models with degree days above 30\xB0C and 25\xB0C as controls. Robustness\
    \ tests include using different climate re-analysis datasets, weighting climate\
    \ data by population, including region-specific time trends, and excluding specific\
    \ countries."
  5: The paper uses a distributed-lag model to assess the long-term impact of day-to-day
    temperature variability on economic growth, finding that negative impacts persist
    for at least two years. The analysis is performed on CAN (Climate Adaptation Network?)
    data partitioned by median national income. The sample period is 1979-2018.
  6: The methodology involves econometric specification, and the results are applicable
    at national and regional scales.
  8: Fixed-effects panel regression models are applied to estimate the effect of annual
    day-to-day temperature variability on economic growth. Regional and yearly fixed
    effects are included to control for unobserved heterogeneity and global shocks.
    Climate data is aggregated to regional levels using area weighting as a baseline,
    and population weighting as a robustness check. The analysis uses data from 1979-2018
    across 1,537 regions in 76 countries.
  9: Regression models were designed to analyze the climate and economic data.
  10: Estimated by model (7) in Table 1
  11: Data from 2008 or the closest year with available data are partitioned based
    on above- and below-median national and regional (GRP) income per capita to analyze
    climate impacts.
  12: Analysis is based on a partition based on regional income, using models shown
    in Supplementary Table 9 and Extended Data Fig. 2b.
More Notes:
  1: Day-to-day variability is measured as the intra-monthly standard deviation of
    daily temperature, averaged across months.
  2: The magnitude of the response is modulated by the seasonal temperature difference.
    Countries which experience smaller seasonal temperature differences are affected
    more by a given change in day-to-day temperature variability. The effect of day-to-day
    temperature variability is independent of changes in annual average temperature.
  6: The study suggests that spill-over effects may influence the results, but their
    assessment is beyond the scope of this work. The authors suggest their work should
    be considered by policymakers and integrated assessment modelers.

  11: The partitioning based on national income is used for Fig. 4, while partitioning
    based on regional income is used for Extended Data Fig. 3, suggesting that climate
    impacts are analyzed separately for these two income partitioning schemes in other
    parts of the study.
Quantitative material:
  1: An extra degree of variability results in a five percentage-point reduction in
    regional growth rates on average. Highest vulnerability in low-latitude, low-income
    regions results in a 12 percentage-point reduction.
  2: An extra degree Celsius of day-to-day temperature variability in a given year
    and region reduces the regional growth rate by at least five percentage points.
  3: Table 1 shows regression results for the effect of climate variables on regional
    growth rates. For example, in model (1), a one-unit change in day-to-day temperature
    variability (Tr;y) is associated with a -0.0538 percentage point change in regional
    growth rates (P<0.001).
  4: Marginal change in growth rate (percentage points) is larger in countries with
    lower GDP per capita. Effects of day-to-day variability are approximately equal
    across the agricultural, manufacturing and services sectors.
  5: The paper finds that marginal losses from an increase in day-to-day temperature
    variability are generally larger for regions in low-income nations compared with
    those in higher-income nations. The analysis shows that the negative impacts of
    day-to-day variability persist for at least two years following the initial shock.
