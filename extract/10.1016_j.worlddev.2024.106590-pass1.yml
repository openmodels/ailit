Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Extreme climate events, specifically El Ni\xF1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\
    \ events, and climate physical risks"
  5: "Strong El Ni\xF1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events (El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1\
    a shocks), climate change-induced physical risks (intensified frequency and magnitude\
    \ of ENSO's cyclical pattern)"
Highlights:
  1: Climate and ENSO events impact sovereign risk in Latin America; Climate physical
    risks (ENSO) affect banking stability in Latin America.
  5: "Strong El Ni\xF1o events can lead to a decline in banking stability due to increased\
    \ credit and liquidity risks. La Ni\xF1a shocks have asymmetrical effects on banking\
    \ stability, with no significant impact. Both El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a shocks\
    \ lead to a significant increase in sovereign spreads. A climate financial vicious\
    \ circle emerges through tighter credit constraints which then lead to underinvestment\
    \ in climate adaptation and mitigation projects."
Methodology:
  1: Applied Econometrics (LP and Panel), Case of Latin American Countries
  5: 'Paper 1: Uses strong ENSO events as a natural experiment for climate shocks.  Paper
    2: Local Projections are computed to assess the dynamic response of sovereign
    spreads to ENSO events.  Paper 3: review of empirical literature and principles
    of the financial accelerator theory.'
More Notes:
  1: The research focuses on Latin American countries.
  5: Costa Rica and Peru are identified as especially subject to the effects of ENSO
    events on sovereign risk.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Sovereign risk, banking stability
  5: Banking stability (decline associated with El Nino), sovereign risk (increase
    in sovereign spreads associated with both El Nino and La Nina)
