Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme climate shocks
  2: Extreme climate shocks (specifically, the 2008 snow disaster in China).
  3: Extreme climate shocks
  4: Extreme weather shocks decrease willingness to cultivate and lead to increased
    agricultural pollution.
  6: Rainfall fluctuations (Rainsi) during the January 2008 snow disaster in China
    is used as a proxy for the degree of snow disaster impacting each county.
  8: The primary driver of risk analyzed is the fluctuation in rainfall, specifically
    extreme snow disasters.
  9: Snow disaster (heavy snowfall event).
  10: Rainfall, Snow Disaster, Land Transfer Policy
  11: Snow disasters, rainfall fluctuations, and potential self-selection biases in
    affected regions.
  12: Extreme climate shocks, specifically a snow disaster, reduced the level of GAD
    by changing production behaviors.
  13: Snow disaster (specifically the 2008 snow disaster in China)
  14: Snow disasters impact Gross Agricultural Development (GAD) differently across
    various climate zones and economic statuses in China.
  15: Extreme climate shocks such as snow disasters impact GAD (Green Agriculture
    Development).
  16: Snow disaster (extreme climate shock)
  17: Snow disaster (extreme climate shock)
  18: Extreme climate shocks (specifically the 2008 snow disaster in China).
  19: Snow disaster.
  20: Rain (snow disasters are mentioned as not biasing the results)
Highlights:
  1: "Extreme climate shocks are detrimental to Green Agricultural Development (GAD),\
    \ decreasing China's GAD level by 3.07%. The impacts are heterogeneous across\
    \ climate and economic zones, with greater impacts in humid and developed regions.\
    \ Shocks affect GAD mainly by reducing farmers\u2019 willingness to cultivate\
    \ and increasing energy consumption, fertilizer, and pesticide input. Extreme\
    \ climate shocks do not reduce agricultural yields in the long run but reduce\
    \ the total value of agricultural production and decrease the quality of agricultural\
    \ products."
  2: "Extreme climate shocks impede Green Agricultural Development (GAD) in the long\
    \ term; the impact on GAD is greater in humid zones and economically developed\
    \ areas; extreme climate shocks hinder GAD by reducing farmers\u2019 willingness\
    \ to cultivate, increasing energy consumption in agricultural production, and\
    \ increasing fertilizer and pesticide inputs."
  3: Extreme climate shocks reduce agricultural output in the short term and increase
    long-term climate risks leading to decreased environmentally friendly agricultural
    practices
  6: The study investigates the effect of the 2008 snow disaster on Green Agricultural
    Development (GAD) in China.
  8: Snow disasters have a significant negative impact on the level of GAD, with its
    effect being very exogenous.
  9: Snow disasters significantly reduce the GAD index. Control variables, aside from
    agriculture-related ones, have little effect on the GAD level, suggesting the
    GAD is relatively independent of overall economic level and government intervention.
  10: Snow disaster has a significant negative impact on the level of the GAD index.
    The impact is not due to sample differences related to highly urbanized municipalities
    (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing).
  12: The snow disaster significantly and negatively impacted the level of GAD, highlighting
    its robustness across different methodologies.
  13: The snow disaster had a negative impact on GAD, and this impact is not driven
    by omitted random variables.
  14: Snow disasters inhibit GAD significantly more in areas with abundant rainfall
    and have a relatively moderate impact in poorer counties due to government subsidies.
  15: There is significant heterogeneity in the impact of snow disasters on GAD across
    regions with different economic development levels.
  16: Snow disasters reduce the utilization rate of cultivated land and increase agricultural
    production energy consumption.
  17: Extreme weather events (snow disasters) lead to increased fertilizer and pesticide
    use by farmers seeking short-term gains. This boosts agricultural output in the
    short term but reduces the long-term quality of agricultural products and decreases
    the value of agricultural output.
  18: Extreme climate shocks hinder GAD, particularly in regions vulnerable to climate
    change and economic shocks.  The shocks reduce farmers' income, alter their expectations,
    and reduce the quality of agricultural products.
  19: Snow disasters hinder Gross Agricultural Domestic Product (GAD) in China. Effective
    irrigation rate and education have a significant positive effect on GAD.
  20: Increased rain has a negative impact on green agricultural development. Education
    and effective irrigation rate are conducive to green agricultural development.

    \ the core independent variable. Z-score method to calculate rainfall fluctuations."
  8: Difference-in-Differences (DID) methodology is used, with interaction terms of
    rainfall fluctuation and time dummy variables to compare affected and non-affected
    regions.
  9: Difference-in-differences (DID) method to estimate the impact of a snow disaster
    on the GAD index. The analysis includes county and time fixed effects, and control
    variables. Robustness checks include a parallel trend test and adding a time trend
    item.
  10: Regression analysis including time trend, municipalities, concurrent events
    (land transfer policy), and climatic factors (rainfall1, rainfall2). Individual
    fixed effects and time fixed effects are included. The analysis covers the period
    2000-2018. The parallel trend test uses data from 2004-2015
  11: Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and 2SLS (two-stage least squares) methods are
    used with control variables for analyzing the effect of snow disasters on GAD,
    with results being significant at the 1% level.
  12: Analysis includes differences-in-differences (DID) based on rainfall fluctuations,
    with robustness checks using instrumental variable estimation with 2007 rainfall
    fluctuations and geographical location (latitude and longitude).
  13: Difference-in-differences (DID) analysis with placebo tests using random assignment
    of provinces to treatment and control groups repeated 500 and 800 times, respectively.
    The analysis aims to isolate the impact of the 2008 snow disaster on GAD.

    zones and economic categories to analyze variations in the impact of snow disasters
    on GAD.
  16: Panel data regression analysis with individual and time fixed effects, using
    arable land utilization rate and agricultural production energy consumption index
    as mechanism variables. The analysis is applicable to understanding the impact
    of snow disasters on agricultural production in the studied region.

    \ rate and education, with data from 2077 counties and 38,142 observations. The\
    \ impact of snow disaster on GAD is estimated by the coefficient of Rainsi \xD7\
    \ Postt."
  20: Regression analysis using panel data from 2077 counties over time. The model
    includes fixed effects for county and/or time. The results are considered robust
    when controlling for effective irrigation rate and education.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the agricultural sector in China. GAD index is calculated
    by the entropy weighting method.
  6: Control variables include total population (POP), agricultural machinery power
    (Machinery), primary industry value-added (First), secondary industry value-added
    (Second), total government expenditure (Expand), and total social investment (Invest),
    all taken as logarithms. County and time fixed effects are also included.
  10: "The 'Rainsi \xD7 Postt' variable is not clearly defined on this page. The paper\
    \ controls for land transfer policy, which potentially improved agricultural scale\
    \ and long-term investment, implying that these concurrent policies could affect\
    \ the overall impact of weather events."
  13: The sample includes 2086 counties from 31 provinces in China. Seven provinces
    were the most affected in the 2008 snow disaster. The placebo tests show that
    the coefficient of randomization was concentrated near 0, which is significantly
    different from the baseline estimation.
  16: The paper focuses on the impact of snow disasters on agricultural practices
    (land utilization and energy consumption) and their potential long-term environmental
    consequences (soil erosion, desertification). The paper analyzes the mechanism
    by which snow disaster impacts GAD (the paper doesn't define this, so I cannot
    assess its relevance to macroeconomic outcomes).
  17: The study uses the logarithm of fertilizer and pesticide input per hectare as
    a proxy for the mechanism through which snow disasters affect Green Agricultural
    Development (GAD). It also suggests that farmers' risk expectations change due
    to extreme climate shocks.
  18: The paper recommends increased investment in agricultural infrastructure, tailored
    agricultural policies, agricultural disaster insurance, and subsidies for green
    production to mitigate the impact of climate shocks and promote GAD.
  19: The study focuses on the impact of snow disasters on agricultural output, specifically
    GAD. The tables explore the sensitivity of the results to controlling for irrigation
    efficiency and education.
