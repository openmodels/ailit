Drivers of Risk:
  1: Growing water demand; Climate change; Socioeconomic conditions (SSP1, SSP2, SSP3)
  10: Climate change impacts on aridity (AI), income growth, population growth, technological
    advancements (e.g., CSP desalination), and water demand.
  11: "GDP per person exceeding a threshold (14000 USDPPPperson\u22121yr\u22121),\
    \ aridity index, and proximity to the seashore."
  12: Climate change impacts on water availability (aridity index); Socioeconomic
    pathways (SSPs) influencing GDP per capita and water use intensity.
Highlights:
  1: "Usage of seawater desalination will have expanded considerably in geographical\
    \ extent. Production will have increased by 1.4\u20132.1-fold in 2011\u20132040\
    \ compared to the present (2005), and 6.7\u201317.3-fold in 2041\u20132070."
  10: Desalination is expected to expand considerably in arid areas by 2055 due to
    income growth. SSP3 shows the greatest volume of desalination due to higher water
    demand. The location of desalination plants also shifts between scenarios.
  11: The cost of seawater desalination as a percentage of GDP is projected to be
    highest in MENA, particularly under the SSP3 scenario in 2055.
  12: Desalination production is projected to increase significantly by 2055, particularly
    in the Middle East and North Africa, driven by water scarcity and population growth
    in arid and semi-arid regions. The contribution of desalination to global water
    requirements remains relatively small (1.6-1.7%) even in 2055, but it plays a
    critical role in arid and semi-arid regions.
Methodology:
  1: "Developed a model to estimate areas where seawater desalination is likely to\
    \ be used as a major water source and the likely volume of production, designed\
    \ to be incorporated into global hydrological models (GHMs). Model requires spatially\
    \ detailed information on climate, income levels, and industrial and municipal\
    \ water use. Applied to a historical year (2005) and two future periods (2011\u2013\
    2040 and 2041\u20132070) under three distinct socioeconomic conditions (SSP1,\
    \ SSP2, and SSP3)."
  10: Uses Seawater Desalination Model (SDM) under different Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSPs) to project future desalination production. SDM2 is also mentioned.
    It uses area utilizing seawater desalination (AUSD) cells as a metric.
  11: "The economic cost of seawater desalination was estimated using the method of\
    \ Lamei et al. (2008), with unit production costs estimated at 0.40\u20133.78\
    \ USD m\u22123 based on data available for 186 plants globally. Future projections\
    \ are sensitive to thresholds related to GDP per capita, aridity, and proximity\
    \ to the seashore."
  12: The study uses global hydrological models to project desalinated water production
    based on SSP scenarios and assumptions about GDP per capita, aridity index (AI),
    and water use intensity. Sensitivity analysis is performed on GDP per capita and
    aridity index.
More Notes:
  1: The model aims to explicitly represent desalinated water as a water source in
    GHMs, which has been largely absent previously.
  10: Condition B in SDM excludes non-hyper-arid regions. The study acknowledges limitations
    in projecting future distributions, comparing projections with current desalination
    plant locations. The study highlights the potential for new technologies to increase
    desalination production beyond current projections.
  11: The study acknowledges that the SDM model failed to reproduce the actual situation
    in some regions in 2005, and that the projections require caution, especially
    in regions with rivers.
  12: The study acknowledges that the threshold for oil-producing nations for desalination
    may be lower than for other countries due to massive consumption of fossil fuels
    for desalination. The sensitivity tests indicate that GDP per capita is a significant
    factor influencing desalination production. Water use intensity, which varies
    across SSPs, also affects the demand for desalination.

  10: "Projected levels of desalinated water production in 2025 are 1.4\u20132.1 times\
    \ greater than present, and in 2055 are 6.7\u201317.3 times greater than present,\
    \ using SDM. Fichtner GmbH (2011) projected 96800 x 10^6 m3 yr-1 for desalination\
    \ production by 2050."
  11: "The cost of seawater desalination is estimated at 0.002\u20130.019% of total\
    \ global GDP in 2005. This number is much higher in MENA, with values of 0.032\u2013\
    0.306%. In 2055, SSP3 showed the highest numbers at 0.011\u20130.100% globally\
    \ and 0.121\u20131.147% for MENA."
