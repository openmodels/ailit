Drivers of Risk:
  2: No relevant information
  7: Structural changes in Turkey shifting employment from agriculture to industry
    and services; rural to urban migration.
  10: Government effectiveness, energy use, carbon emissions, participation democracy
  12: GDP, Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GCF), Agricultural Labor Force Ratio (EA),
    Urbanization Rate (UP), Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism
    (PS), Rule of Law Index (RL)
  13: Not explicitly stated, but the analysis aims to identify factors determining
    agricultural value added.
  14: GDP per capita, gross fixed capital formation, agricultural labor force (% of
    total labor force), urbanization rate (% of total population), political stability,
    rule of law index
  20: Agricultural labor force ratio (% of total labor force), urbanization rate (%
    of total population), political stability and rule of law index series are identified
    as drivers of value-added agriculture.
Drivers_of_Risk:
  19: Natural conditions affecting agriculture, with an emphasis on inability to intervene
    and importance of improving agricultural productivity.
Highlights:
  2: Value-added agriculture is positively related to GDP per capita, gross fixed
    capital formation, the agricultural labor force rate, and the rate of urbanization.
    Value-added agriculture is negatively related to the rule of law index.
  7: Agriculture's share of GDP and employment has decreased significantly in Turkey
    over time, while the service sector has grown.
  9: The literature review aims to contribute to the existing knowledge due to the
    variety of variables considered in the analyzed studies. One study finds that
    increases in agricultural incentives have a positive effect on agricultural value
    added using panel data analysis for 5 developing countries (Turkey, South Africa,
    Mexico, China and Brazil) from 2000-2016.
  10: Agricultural value added, participant democracy, and energy use have a statistically
    significant impact on carbon emissions.
  13: Hausman test suggests that the random effects model should be preferred for
    the analysis of agricultural value added.
  14: Agricultural value added has a statistically significant and positive relationship
    with GDP per capita, agricultural labor force, and urbanization rate. It has a
    statistically significant but negative relationship with the rule of law index.
    Relationship with gross fixed capital formation (positive) is only significant
    with System GMM. No statistically significant relationship was found between agricultural
    value added and political stability.
  19: Findings indicate increased value-added agriculture is associated with GDP per
    capita, gross fixed capital formation, and urbanization, but negatively affected
    by the rule of law index; no effect from political stability.
  20: The study aims to determine the determinants of value-added agriculture by categorizing
    variables across economic, social, political, and legal frameworks, contributing
    to economic growth and welfare.
Methodology:
  2: Panel data analysis using fixed effects model, random effects model, the generalized
    method of moments (GMM), system GMM, and robust (resistive error) estimators econometric
    models. Annual data from 20 selected countries for the period 2000-2018 obtained
    from the World Bank (WB) and Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) websites.
  9: Literature review of empirical studies on the determinants of agricultural value
    added, focusing on country/country groups and Turkey.
  10: Panel data analysis, System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), Fixed effects
    model, Random effects model, Robust estimators
  12: Dynamic panel data analysis using Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Fixed
    effects and random effects models are also mentioned. Hausman test is used to
    choose between fixed and random effects models.
  13: Panel data analysis using fixed effects, random effects, Arellano-Bond dynamic
    GMM, and system GMM estimators. Hausman test is used to determine the appropriate
    model (fixed or random effects).
  14: Panel data analysis using Fixed Effects, Random Effects, GMM, and System GMM
    estimators for the period 2000-2018.
  19: The analysis is performed using dynamic GMM, System GMM, Fixed Effects, and
    Random Effects models for panel data analysis, with a focus period limited by
    data availability.
  20: The study analyzes the determinants of value-added agriculture based on various
    categorized variables (economic, social, political, and legal).
More Notes:
  2: The paper investigates determinants of value-added agriculture but doesn't explicitly
    address climate change risks or adaptation costs/benefits.
  7: The paper focuses on the changing structure of the Turkish economy and the role
    of agriculture within it. It does not explicitly analyze climate change risks
    or adaptation.
  10: The study uses data from 20 countries for the period 2000-2014. The determinants
    of agricultural value added are analyzed using panel data analysis.
  14: The paper focuses on agricultural value added determinants, not explicitly on
    climate change or adaptation. However, variables like agricultural labor force,
    urbanization rate, and GDP can be impacted by climate change and adaptation policies.

Outcomes_of_Interest:
  19: The study finds a positive and significant relationship between value-added
    agriculture and GDP per capita, as well as gross fixed capital formation; no relationship
    with political stability, and a negative relationship with the rule of law index.
Quantitative material:
  2: No relevant information
  13: Hausman test results are presented in Table 5, including coefficients for independent
    variables (Lngdp, gcf, ea, up, ps, rl) under fixed and random effects models,
    the difference between the coefficients, and robust standard errors. The Ki-square
    value is 4.06 with a probability of 0.6692.
  14: The agricultural value added is explained by 88% of all independent variables
    in the evaluated model.
