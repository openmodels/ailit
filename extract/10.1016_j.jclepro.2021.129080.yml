Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (specifically, increasing maximum temperatures).
  3: Climate change impacts on peak electricity load driven by annual maximum temperatures
    in China's provinces.
  4: Temperature increases, population increases, urbanization rate increases, economic
    output levels (GDP), industrial structure (specifically the share of the secondary
    industry)
  5: Temperature changes lead to regional differences in peak load impacts due to
    economic development level, influencing use of air conditioning.
  6: Climate change (specifically, maximum temperature increases); Socioeconomic development
    paths.
  7: Climate change (temperature rise) and socioeconomic factors (population growth,
    urbanization, total factor productivity, economic development) are identified
    as drivers impacting peak load demand. The increasing use of air conditioners
    is highlighted as a significant channel through which climate change affects peak
    load.
  8: Climate variables; Climate and socioeconomic variables; Different climate scenarios
    (SSP1-RCP2.6, SSP2-RCP4.5, SSP4-RCP6.0, and SSP5-RCP8.5)
Highlights:
  1: "A 1\xB0C increase in highest temperature will, on average, rise the peak load\
    \ by 0.385 GW in China."
  3: Response model identifies linear relationship between high maximum temperatures
    and increased peak electricity loads.
  4: Temperature increases significantly increase peak power load.
  5: Eastern China shows significant peak load increases due to higher air conditioning
    ownership and economic development.
  6: Socioeconomic variables have larger impacts on the peak load than temperatures;
    Increased peak load from climate change will cause additional investment demand
    for electricity supply infrastructure.
  7: Peak load is projected to increase significantly by 2100, with socioeconomic
    factors playing a larger role than temperature increases. The spatial distribution
    of load is expected to remain similar, with Eastern China having the highest peak
    load.
  8: Including both climate and socioeconomic variables leads to significantly higher
    peak load growth rate forecasts compared to only including climate variables,
    particularly under SSP2-RCP4.5 and SSP5-RCP8.5 scenarios.
Methodology:
  1: Estimates the response functions of annual peak loads to maximum temperatures
    in China and then predicts future peak loads under different scenarios.
  3: The study employs a two-way fixed effect panel data model based on peak load
    response to temperature changes across 31 provinces in China from 1998-2018.
  4: National regression analysis using a two-way fixed effects model (Province and
    Year). Robustness test using Two-Stage Least Square (TSLS) estimation with the
    first-order lag term of GDP as an instrumental variable. Analysis covers the period
    1998-2018 in China.
  5: Analysis of load-temperature responses across three regions in China using empirical
    data, focusing on the mediating effect of air conditioning ownership.
  6: Employs estimated temperature-load response functions to forecast peak load and
    required infrastructure investment; Four scenarios are developed based on the
    SSPs from CMIP6 and the RCPs from Vuuren et al. (2011).
  7: The study uses load-temperature response functions to project national peak load
    under different SSP-RCP scenarios, projecting out to 2100.
  8: Forecasts of peak load growth rate under different climate scenarios (SSPs and
    RCPs) and with/without socioeconomic variables included.
More Notes:
  1: The impact of maximum temperature on peak load varies substantially among different
    regions, with the most significant impacts in Eastern China. The adoption and
    penetration of air conditioners is an important channel to materialize the impacts
    from temperature change to peak load.
  4: Endogeneity between GDP and power load was tested and found to be insignificant.
    Regional heterogeneity can affect the responses of electricity load to temperature
    changes.
  6: The cost projection of wind and solar power generation projects are based on
    the China Electric Power Technology and Economy Development Research Report 2019,
    and the operating reserve share of installed capacity is set as 15% based on Chen
    et al. (2021).
  7: The study suggests policy implications including integrating climate change into
    long-term power system planning, promoting energy-efficient air conditioning technologies,
    developing demand response programs, and utilizing electricity markets to guide
    investment and planning. The authors recognize the need for further research to
    address the impacts of new climate change policies, improve spatial granularity
    of data, and address potential endogeneity problems.
  8: The study uses maps to visualize the forecast of provincial peak loads in 2030,
    2050, and 2100 under different climate scenarios.

    \ end of this century, requiring an additional infrastructure investment of 275\u2013\
    617 billion yuan per year."
  4: "A 1\xB0C increase in maximum temperature will increase peak load by an average\
    \ of 0.385 GW, or 2.33% compared to the historical average (1998-2018)."
  5: "In Eastern China, a 1\xB0C rise in maximum temperature results in a 0.708 GW\
    \ increase in peak load."
  6: National peak load is the highest (6816 GW) under the SSP 5-RCP 8.5 scenario
    by the end of this century, while it is the lowest (3808 GW) under the SSP4-RCP
    6.0 scenario; Average increase in the peak load is about 399 GW under the four
    RCPs by the end of this century when only temperature changes are considered;
