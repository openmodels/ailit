Drivers of Risk:
  2: "The global median b decreased during 1982 to 2015 at a rate of \u22120.92 \xB1\
    \ 0.12% 100 ppm\u22121 year\u22121"
  4: Increasing constraints on vegetation productivity from emerging nutrient limitations
    and imbalances (Nitrogen and Phosphorus), and underestimated sensitivity of terrestrial
    GPP to changes in water availability. Declining atmospheric nutrient supplies.
    Decreases in foliar nutrients. Insufficient P availability.
  7: The decline in the carbon fertilization effect (CFE) on vegetation photosynthesis
    due to factors like limiting plant nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus).
Highlights:
  2: Across the global terrestrial areas, b declined from 1982-2015
  4: TRENDY models likely underestimate the ongoing strong decrease in b inferred
    from satellite datasets. Vegetation with lower foliar nutrient concentrations
    generally showed larger declines in b. Insufficient P availability generally had
    negative impacts on b.
  7: The carbon fertilization effect (CFE) is declining, which could lead to underestimation
    of future warming and has implications for long-term climate change mitigation.
Methodology:
  2: Linear and nonlinear multiple regression approaches were used to estimate b from
    satellite GPP proxies at each pixel across the globe (12, 13, 20). Pixels with
    large land-cover changes were excluded from the analyses (supplementary text S2
    and fig. S6). The Mann-Kendall test was used to estimate the trend of b pixel
    by pixel.
  4: Regression approaches to estimate trends in b. Linear spatial mixed-effects model
    to investigate the relationship between the trend of b and foliar N or P concentrations.
    Analysis of sensitivity of satellite GPP to Total Water Storage (TWS) using a
    moving window of 15 years in different climate zones.
More Notes:
  2: No relevant information
  7: This study focuses on the biophysical effects of climate change (specifically,
    the declining CFE) and its potential to impact climate models, rather than directly
    quantifying macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. It suggests a potential risk factor
    that could influence future economic impacts.
No relevant information:
  3: This page focuses on the impact of increasing atmospheric CO2 on Gross Primary
    Productivity (GPP), a measure of vegetation productivity, rather than macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes or the costs/benefits of adaptation at a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: No relevant information
  4: Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) percent increase per 100-ppm increase in CO2
    (b)
  7: Future warming might currently be underestimated due to a decline in the carbon
    fertilization effect.
