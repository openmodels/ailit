Drivers of Risk:
  1: Droughts and water scarcity; Land and water management decisions; Interaction
    of drought with other threats.
  2: Droughts impact lives, livelihoods, health, ecosystems, societies, cultures,
    services and infrastructure due to the vulnerability of an exposed society or
    system.
  6: Droughts (specifically El Nino in Colombia) are identified as the drivers of
    risk impacting agricultural production and GDP.
  7: Drought, reduced water flows to drought-prone areas due to upstream extraction,
    increasing upstream-downstream inequalities in access to water.
  8: Hydrological drought and water stress; rising water demands; depletion of groundwater
    reserves; changing hydrological conditions reducing river water levels.
  10: Droughts, water scarcity, inadequate systems to protect vulnerable populations
    from drought, negative perceptions of drought-prone areas.
  11: Droughts and land and water management decisions that deepen vulnerability to
    droughts over time.

Highlights:
  1: Global economic assessments often fail to connect to holistic consideration of
    vulnerability at a local scale, resulting in systemic effects of land and water
    management decisions being missed; Avoidable costs of drought, degradation, and
    desertification are underestimated globally; Simple preventive actions are routinely
    overlooked, deprioritized, and underfunded.
  2: Vulnerability to droughts and their impacts can be altered by the actions of
    society through adjustment of land and water management practices.
  6: Vulnerability assessments, particularly those relying on physical mapping and
    modeling, can overlook the economic activities and contributions of the most vulnerable
    people (e.g., marginal land users, women) and can even exacerbate existing inequalities.
  7: Drought causes significant economic losses, particularly affecting livestock
    raising and reducing economic growth. Upstream water extraction exacerbates downstream
    drought vulnerability, creating inequalities.
  8: Areas with greater water utilization can be considered more vulnerable to drought;
    Droughts are no longer buffered by groundwater reserves; Depleted water tables
    can cause river water to seep into surrounding dry soil; Courts cannot order water
    not to flow out of a porous riverbed if the water-table is depleted.
  10: Global economic assessments often fail to connect to holistic consideration
    of vulnerability at the local scale. Anticipation of high risks, low returns and
    poor economic prospects in drought-prone economies causes systematic underinvestment,
    affecting national economic growth.
  11: Global economic assessments often fail to connect to holistic local understandings
    of vulnerability and systemic effects of land and water management decisions.

Methodology:
  1: Rapid review of experiences from selected nations and available literature documenting
    methodological approaches to assess drought impacts and vulnerability at the local
    level.
  2: Rapid review of available methodological approaches to assess drought impacts
    and vulnerability and the experiences of applying them in various nations.
  6: The paper discusses vulnerability mapping, rapid value assessments of losses
    after droughts, and modeling land-based production systems. These methods are
    used to connect ecological maps and models to economic contributions, model environmental
    externalities, and convert effects on physical production systems into economic
    effects.
  7: Qualitative findings compared to quantitative data on household characteristics
    from programs like PSNP and HSNP, and national early warning system data for drought
    monitoring. Impact assessment following the 2008-11 drought.
  8: Basin- or catchment-level water resource accounting; Comparison of available
    water volumes to extracted volumes; Consideration of water volumes stored in surface
    water bodies and underground.
  11: Multiscale, systemic approaches to drought vulnerability and risk assessment;
    participatory diagnostic tools for vulnerability assessment.
  16: References participatory scenario development approaches for identifying pro-poor
    adaptation options, and vulnerability and capacity assessment tools.
More Notes:
  1: The review aims to inform a global initiative by the UNCCD to mitigate the effects
    of drought on vulnerable ecosystems and communities.
  2: The paper explores how drought vulnerability assessments can include consideration
    of the social imperative for sustainable development to leave no one behind, which
    is important for drought risk mitigation policy and planning.
  6: Quantitative economic assessments of vulnerability can be controversial and raise
    equity issues. Modeling complex land-based production systems (e.g., livestock)
    requires layering different methods, modeling tools, and databases due to the
    multiple factors involved.
  7: National drought management responses have been strengthened and early warning
    systems put in place at the national level in Kenya. Trades and value chains that
    are destroyed alongside the livelihoodsofthevulnerablecommunitieshaveattractedincreasingattentionandestimatesoftheir
    net worth are growing.
  10: The paper emphasizes the importance of multi-scale, systemic approaches to drought
    vulnerability and risk assessment on a global level. National policies often fail
    to consider the effects on communities and ecosystems beyond their borders.
  16: The page primarily consists of citations related to community-based adaptation,
    vulnerability assessments, and participatory approaches, mainly focused on East
    Africa. No specific macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, or quantitative analysis
    of national-level adaptation costs and benefits are directly presented. The page
    provides references to tools and methodologies used in assessing climate change
    vulnerability and adaptation options.

  7: Economic losses associated with drought, loss of economic growth.
  8: Water stress and scarcity during drought can escalate the costs of accessing
    water, which will disadvantage lower income groups.
  10: National economic growth rates and profiles are affected, leading to costs of
    inaction regarding drought risk mitigation.
  11: The paper discusses global economic assessments of drought impacts and the costs
    of continued and increasing risks, implying GDP effects and productivity loss
