Drivers of Risk:
  1: Trends in agricultural productivity, climate change (specifically crop yield
    impacts of increasing CO2 concentrations), growing population, increased biofuel
    demand.
  3: Agricultural demand and supply drivers, climate change (implied through reference
    to Lobell et al. 2013)
  4: Changes in average per capita dietary energy intake; variations in dietary energy
    deficits faced by malnourished persons across regions.
  6: Demand only; Climate change (No CO2 fert.); Climate change (CO2 fert.)
  8: Population, per capita incomes, bioenergy policies, agricultural productivity,
    climate change, stagnation in agricultural productivity, lack of access to inputs,
    weakened institutions, higher food prices.
  11: Stagnant agricultural productivity growth; Price changes; Income growth
  13: Climate change, CO2 fertilization effects, population growth, income growth,
    total factor productivity (TFP), and biofuel use.
  14: Population growth, increased biofuel use, and climate change contribute to greater
    food insecurity at the global level. Growth in per capita incomes and TFP improve
    nutritional outcomes.
  15: Population growth, income, biofuel use, climate change (with and without CO2
    fertilization), and Total Factor Productivity (TFP).
  16: Population, TFP (Total Factor Productivity), per capita income, biofuels, and
    climate change.
Highlights:
  1: Global food security is projected to improve from 2006-2050 due to income growth
    and agricultural productivity increases, leading to a decrease in malnutrition.
    However, these results are heavily dependent on agricultural productivity growth
    and are subject to uncertainty due to climate change impacts on crop yields.
  4: The malnutrition gap provides insight into the average depth of hunger across
    regions and its changes within regions, which is missed by just looking at the
    incidence of malnutrition.
  6: Climate change is projected to impact average dietary energy consumption and
    malnutrition, with variations depending on CO2 fertilization effects. Malnutrition
    counts are projected to increase substantially under climate change scenarios,
    particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
  8: There is great uncertainty in the future of agricultural productivity particularly
    in the crop sector. Population generally will slow down relative to per capita
    income, which highlights the growing importance of per capita income as a key
    driver of food demand especially in developing regions.
  11: "Improvements in nutritional outcomes are severely dampened if agricultural\
    \ productivity stagnates; Regions with slower malnutrition incidence decline relative\
    \ to baseline: sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, South East Asia; One-third\
    \ of the world\u2019s malnourished may reside in sub-Saharan Africa by 2050 under\
    \ stagnant productivity scenario."
  13: Climate change can significantly impact nutritional outcomes of millions, particularly
    in hunger-stricken regions.
  14: At the global level, the reduction in malnutrition headcount will be mainly
    driven by TFP growth followed by per capita income growth. Population growth is
    a key driver of malnutrition in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and South East
    Asia.
  15: Population growth is a significant driver of malnutrition. Climate change has
    a greater impact on global malnutrition than increased biofuel use. Socio-economic
    drivers such as population and per capita income have a greater impact on the
    headcount of people at risk of hunger than climate change.
  16: Future nutritional outcomes will be mainly affected by socio-economic conditions
    as well as productivity trends in the agricultural sector. Climate change will
    still be a relevant driver of nutritional outcomes especially for those residing
    in regions of the world where chronic malnutrition is prevalent.
Methodology:
  1: Partial equilibrium model of global agriculture incorporating a food security
    module that links changes in the average dietary energy intake to shifts in the
    full caloric distribution.
  3: "Uses the Simpli\uFB01ed International Model of agricultural Prices, Land use\
    \ and the Environment (SIMPLE) model to project changes in the global farm and\
    \ food system from 2006 to 2050. A food security module is introduced to extract\
    \ nutritional outcomes from SIMPLE, which characterizes the distribution of dietary\
    \ energy consumption, links food caloric content to per capita income, and relates\
    \ changes in average per capita DEC to shifts in its distribution and malnutrition\
    \ metrics."
  4: The authors use malnutrition incidence and gap measures, treating them analogously
    to poverty index and gap. They apply poverty-growth elasticities to link these
    measures to average per capita dietary energy intake, assuming a lognormal distribution
    of per capita dietary energy consumption. The analysis relies on FAO food security
    data.
  6: The analysis uses a model to project food security statistics to 2050 under different
    scenarios, compared to a 2006 baseline. The model's inconsistencies may have been
    driven by domestic agricultural policies, foreign trade agreements and other barriers
    to international trade.
  8: The authors use the SIMPLE model to implement a series of carefully designed
    scenarios to assess how global food security will be affected. They examine the
    impacts of population, per capita income growth, increased biofuel use, and productivity
    improvements in the crop, livestock, and processed food sectors. They also consider
    crop yield effects from climate change with and without CO2 fertilization.
  11: Simulation using SIMPLE model, comparing baseline scenario to 'Demand only'
    scenario (supply-side drivers ignored) to isolate impact of agricultural productivity
    growth on nutritional attainment, results are applicable in 2050
  14: The analysis decomposes the results of a longer and forward-looking scenario.
    The impacts of rising per capita incomes, increased biofuel use, TFP growth, and
    climate change yield effects are expressed relative to the contribution of population
    growth.
  15: The SIMPLE model with a food security module is used to calculate malnutrition
    headcount, prevalence, and depth. An historical experiment from 1991 to 2001 based
    on historical growth rates was conducted to evaluate the model. Future projections
    are from 2006 to 2050.
  16: Analysis of individual drivers of global food security; scenarios illustrating
    the importance of looking at nutritional outcomes based on distribution of caloric
    consumption.
More Notes:
  1: The model is validated against an historical period, and future scenarios are
    used to understand the impacts of key exogenous drivers. The analysis focuses
    on global food security outcomes, not direct macroeconomic or fiscal measures
    at a national level, however national economies are indirectly impacted by these
    outcomes.
  3: The model has been validated against historical data (1961-2006) and shown to
    capture observed global changes in crop production, area, yield and price.
  6: The model may not accurately capture the distribution of crop production across
    regions due to factors like domestic agricultural policies and trade agreements.
  11: The increase in food consumption is related to increased livestock commodities
    consumption
  13: The paper emphasizes the importance of considering the distribution of caloric
    energy across regions, not just average dietary energy consumption.
  14: The study mentions a 'historical puzzle of reduced caloric consumption', suggesting
    a potential complexity in the relationship between income and nutrition.
  15: Model performance is less satisfactory at the regional level, particularly in
    South Asia.
  16: The impact of climate change on future nutritional outcomes is uncertain, depending
    on the strength of yield impacts of CO2 fertilization.

Quantitative material:
  1: Baseline income growth, coupled with projected increases in agricultural productivity,
    lead to a 24 per cent rise in global average dietary energy intake (2006-2050).
    The incidence of malnutrition falls by 84 per cent, lifting more than half a billion
    people out of extreme hunger (2006-2050).
  4: "Equations (1) and (2) provide formulas for calculating growth elasticities for\
    \ the malnutrition index (\u025BMI) and the malnutrition gap index (\u025BMGI),\
    \ linking them to average dietary energy intake. The variables in these equations\
    \ include: minimum daily energy requirement (w), average per capita DEC (y), and\
    \ standard deviation of the DEC distribution (r)."
  6: Table provides quantitative estimates for the listed outcomes under baseline
    (2006) and future scenarios (2050) for world and several regions (sub-Saharan
    Africa, Central Asia, China/Mongolia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central America,
    South America).
  11: Malnutrition exceeds baseline by more than four times (7.9% vs. 1.9%); Global
    malnutrition count declines slightly to 729 million people; Malnutrition headcount
    in sub-Saharan Africa rises by 193 million relative to the baseline
  13: The impacts of income and TFP growth on the world malnutrition headcount over
    the historical period (1991-2001) are around 47% and 109% as large as the population
    impact and opposite in sign, respectively.
  14: Table 2 shows the contribution of selected drivers on malnutrition count in
    millions, for both historical (1991-2001) and future (2006-2050) scenarios, by
    region.
  15: Climate change (no CO2 fertilization) contributes around 16% of the impact of
    population on changes in the global malnutrition count. Biofuel use contributes
    roughly 6% of the contribution of population growth on global malnutrition count.
  16: From 1991 to 2001, population and TFP were the dominant drivers of malnutrition
    count. Impact of population on malnutrition headcount exceeds that of per capita
    income. Contribution of biofuels and climate change are far lower than that of
    the other drivers. Going forward to 2050, the relative impact of population on
    malnutrition count will be offset by the relative contribution of per capita income
    and TFP growth.
