Drivers of Risk:
  2: Portuguese warm-dry summers critically limit crop growth, mainly due to summertime
    low water availability. Extreme winter/spring weather events, such as hail and
    frost, tend to occur in some northern regions and to infringe important damages
    to this crop.
More Notes:
  2: The paper provides a general overview of the Portuguese viticulture sector and
    its environmental context, but it does not give any projections or quantitative
    analysis of future climate change impacts or adaptation costs and benefits at
    a national level.
No relevant information:
  6: No relevant information
  8: This page focuses on the STICS crop model and its application to grapevine yield
    and quality, but does not contain information on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes,
    economic costs/benefits of adaptation at a national level, or national-level drivers
    of risk. The study focuses on simulating crop behavior and validating the model
    against observed data.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Viticulture and winemaking socioeconomic sector play a key role in Portugal's
    economic growth, accounting for nearly 2% of national export income.
Quantitative material:
  2: Vineyard area in Portugal is over 229 kha, with an annual wine production of
    about 6.7 Mhl. Table wines represent 55% of the total national exports, followed
    by DO wines with 36%, which include fortified wines, such as Port wine as well
    as Regional wines with 12%.
