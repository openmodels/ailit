Drivers of Risk:
  1: Exposure to floods and droughts.
  2: Recurrent floods and droughts affecting agriculture-dependent livelihoods and
    economic growth
  3: Floods and droughts
  4: Floods and droughts in different geographic and hydrogeological regions.
  6: Floods and droughts
  7: Flood and drought exposed areas (FLEA and DREA)
  8: Above-average monsoon and annual rainfall (floods), below-average rainfall (droughts),
    cyclones.
  10: Area exposed to floods (FLEA) and droughts (DREA)
  11: Exposure to floods and droughts is impacting GSDP across various sectors.
  12: Percentage of area exposed to floods and droughts, and lagged values of these
    exposures.
  13: Floods and droughts.
  14: Floods and droughts, groundwater depletion.
  15: Floods; Droughts; Over-exploitation of groundwater; Climate change (implied)
Highlights:
  1: Floods expose a large area, but droughts have the most significant impact at
    the sub-national level. The most affected GSDPs are in the non-agriculture sectors,
    positively by the floods and negatively by droughts. No significant influence
    on human development.
  2: Sub-national analysis is vital given the large investments in flood protection
    and the importance for regional policy planning
  5: The table highlights variations in economic indicators like GSDP and HDI among
    different Indian states, which could indirectly suggest differing fiscal capacities
    for adaptation to macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks.
  7: Flood and drought exposed areas significantly impact GSDP and HDI.
  8: Eastern Region states (Bihar, Assam) have high flood exposure and low GSDP. Drought
    exposure was most extensive in southern, western, and central states. Gujarat
    and Rajasthan had the most extensive drought exposure in the early 2000s, which
    decreased substantially by 2015. Punjab and Haryana have increased flood exposure
    after 2010.
  10: Areas exposed to floods and droughts have substantial GSDP exposure; FLEA is
    generally associated with significantly higher GSDP, except in the NWR; There
    seemed to be statistically significant impacts of flood mitigation investments,
    especially in the ER, and SWR.
  11: The impact of floods on groundwater recharge can outweigh the cost of floods
    by enhancing water availability, which is critical to economic activities in many
    states.
  12: Drought exposure negatively impacts non-agriculture sector GDP in the ER. Flood
    exposure in the NWR has a positive influence on non-agriculture GDP. Floods generally
    have a negative influence on human development in all regions except the NWR.
    Lagged drought exposure has a significant negative influence on HDI.
  13: "Floods and droughts have varying impacts on different economic sectors and\
    \ regions within India. Despite limited impacts on national GDP, intra-country\
    \ variations highlight the need for increased investment in flood and drought\
    \ mitigation and adaptation. Droughts generally impact GSDP in all states, but\
    \ significantly only through the non-agriculture sector. Droughts have a significant\
    \ negative impact on agriculture GSDP only in the NCR, indicating these regions\u2019\
    \ inadequate adaptation preparedness and capacity. Massive investments in flood\
    \ mitigation and adaptation in the ER states boost its GDP and also the HDI."
  14: Floods and droughts have wide-ranging impacts across different regions and states.
    Adaptation to droughts is the way forward for growth in both the agriculture and
    non-agriculture sectors in the absence of adequate water resources. Floods help
    natural recharge of groundwater.
  15: Flood impacts vary by region. In NWR states (e.g., Punjab and Haryana), floods
    can help recharge over-exploited groundwater. In ER states, flood mitigation and
    adaptation investments are crucial for livelihoods. SWR states benefit from large
    floodspreads, but their frequency is low, making drought adaptation investments
    important. Central and Northern states are mainly constrained by droughts. Intra-state
    variation is significant, necessitating finer spatial resolution for risk information.
Methodology:
  1: A fixed-effect panel regression analysis is used to assess the impacts of exposure
    to floods and droughts on GSDP and HDI in 19 Indian states from 2001 to 2015.
    Flood and drought exposure are estimated using satellite data.
  2: Uses gridded time-series information of floods and droughts exposure derived
    from fine-scale satellite data
  3: The study uses data and methodology to analyze flood and drought trends in exposed
    areas and consequent damages. It also analyzes the impacts of floods and droughts
    on per-capita GSDP and HDI.
  4: Panel data analysis at the state level comparing various geographic and hydrogeological
    groups.
  6: Uses MODIS surface reflectance product (MOD09A1) from NASA's Earth Observing
    System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) to identify flood-exposed and drought-exposed
    pixels at 500 m spatial resolution. Flood inundation mapping algorithms, with
    the aid of digital elevation models (DEMs), classify pixels into temporary flooded
    or permanent water bodies. FLEA (Flood-Exposed Area) is calculated as the total
    area of temporarily flooded pixels of 8-day MODIS images between 2001 and 2013.
  7: State and time fixed effect panel regression models are used to assess the extent
    to which flood and drought exposed areas influence GSDP exposed to floods and
    droughts, sectoral GSDP per person, and HDI. Models include lagged flood and drought
    exposed areas to test for carry-over effects.
  8: "Two-stage least-squares regression analysis is used with monthly rainfall and\
    \ deviation of monsoon and non-monsoon season rainfall from the averages as instrumental\
    \ variables. Wu\u2013Hausman test is used for endogeneity and Wald and Sargens\
    \ test are used for suitability and overidenti\uFB01bility of the models with\
    \ instrument variables. The study presents data for three specific years (2003,\
    \ 2010, 2013 for floods; years with below-average rainfall for droughts) and observes\
    \ trends over time."
  10: Time and state fixed panel regressions; Wu-Hausman test for endogeneity (flood
    exposed area); Wald and Sargen tests for instrument variables.
  11: Fixed effect panel regression analysis is used to assess impacts on agriculture,
    non-agriculture, and total GSDP at the state level.
  12: Panel regression models are used to estimate the impact of flood and drought
    exposure on per-capita GSDP and HDI, controlling for state-fixed effects. Statistical
    significance is indicated at 0.005, 0.05, and 0.1 probability levels.
  13: Analysis of the effects of floods and droughts on GSDP and HDI at the regional
    level in India.
  14: State-level analysis to illustrate intra-country impacts of natural disasters.
  15: Statistical data analysis; Remote sensing data assessment; Exposure analysis
More Notes:
  1: Profiling disasters impacts at even smaller sub-national units such as districts
    can lead to effective targeted mitigation and adaptation activities, reduce shocks,
    and accelerate income growth and human development.
  2: Focuses on shifting from national to sub-national level assessments, highlighting
    spatial impacts of natural disasters
  6: Analysis uses flood-exposed area (FLEA) as an indicator of flood extent. Information
    on the intensity and duration of multiple floods within a year was not available
    for the analysis. It also shows the GSDP exposed to flood and droughts, although
    that data is not described on this page.
  7: The drought-exposed area (DREA) is the maximum area exposed to meteorological
    or agricultural droughts. The Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI) identifies
    drought-exposed pixels based on NDVI and NDWI estimated from satellite images.
    For floods, the analysis considers data of 2003, 2010 and 2013, years with above
    average monsoon rainfall. For droughts, the focus is on 2002, 2009, and 2015,
    the years with below average monsoon rainfall.
  8: The NCR (National Capital Region) and ER (Eastern Region) states may have focused
    more on mitigating flood exposure than drought, or addressing other pressing social
    issues. Some states with enhanced infrastructure may have mitigated drought impacts
    but seen increased flood exposure.
  10: The dichotomy in NWR could be due to increased flood exposure of areas with
    low non-agriculture activities; Spread of floods in drought-stricken areas contributed
    to groundwater recharge, which was the primary source of water for most economic
    activities, however the hypothesis tested with lag one DREA showed no statistically
    significant relationship.
  12: The analysis suggests that adaptation actions may explain differences in the
    impact of climate events across regions. The positive impact of floods in the
    NWR on GSDP and HDI is attributed to increased groundwater supply. Regional differences
    in agricultural productivity growth are also noted.
  13: The paper emphasizes regional variations in the impact of climate-related events
    and the importance of tailored adaptation strategies for different regions within
    India.
  15: The study emphasizes the importance of spatially targeted interventions for
    mitigation and adaptation, advocating for sub-national risk information at the
    district or block level.
