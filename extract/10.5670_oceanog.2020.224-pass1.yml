Drivers of Risk:
  2: Sea level changes are driven by ice volume changes, atmospheric CO2 levels, tectonic
    processes, and Earth's orbital changes.
  3: Changes in ocean temperature, land ice volume, and the volumes of ocean basins.
    Human-induced changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations (from 280 ppm in ~1850
    to 414 ppm in 2020).
  4: Ice volume changes, thermal expansion, ocean crust production, LIPs, orogeny,
    global sedimentation, basin flooding/desiccation, lakes and aquifers, greenhouse
    sea level changes.
  5: "Sea level variations on the order of 15\xB110 m as significant ice sheets grew\
    \ and decayed."
  6: Atmospheric CO2 concentrations; Changes in ice sheet volume (EAIS, WAIS, GIS);
    Orbital cycles (precession, tilt, eccentricity); Volcanism (Columbia River basalts)
  7: "Changes in GMSL due to past climate variations, anthropogenic forcings and future\
    \ warming scenarios (2\xB0C and 5\xB0C warming scenarios)"
  8: Anthropogenic warming, ocean warming, melting of ice sheets and mountain glaciers,
    future emissions pathways.
Evaluation overview:

    for future climate change impacts, relevant for evaluating the risks to modern
    coastlines.
  3: Sea level change, both modern and ancient, and its drivers.

  5: No relevant information
  6: No relevant information
  7: Provides an overview of global mean sea level (GMSL) estimates and projections.
  8: GMSL (Global Mean Sea Level) rise and its impacts.
Highlights:
  2: "Modern sea level rise began in the late nineteenth century, largely due to global\
    \ warming and ice melt; under moderate emission scenarios, GMSL is likely to rise\
    \ 0.4\u20131.0 m this century, with potential increases greater than 2 m under\
    \ higher emissions."
  3: "Sea level changes are driven by changes in ocean temperature, land ice volume,\
    \ and ocean basin volumes. The Anthropocene is characterized by human-induced\
    \ modifications of Earth\u2019s climate state due to changes in atmospheric CO2."
  4: "Coral and marsh dating provide the most accurate means of reconstructing sea\
    \ level for the Late Pleistocene to present. Sequence stratigraphy and backstripping,\
    \ combined with benthic foraminiferal \u03B418O and Mg/Ca records, help estimate\
    \ sea level, accounting for compaction, loading, and thermal subsidence."
  5: Significant ice sheets can exist in regions of high Antarctic topography even
    while subtropical conditions persist along the coast.
  6: "Middle to Late Eocene sea level record indicates dynamic growth and collapse\
    \ of moderately large ice sheets (0%\u201375% of modern EAIS), controlled by the\
    \ 1,200 kyr tilt cycle. A continental-scale EAIS developed in the Icehouse Early\
    \ Oligocene. The Pliocene recorded the last major warm period when CO2 was similar\
    \ to 2020 and sea levels stood ~22\xB110 m above present."
  7: GMSL estimates and projections under different warming scenarios up to 2200.
  8: "Modern GMSL rise is not a remnant of deglaciation, but is due to anthropogenic\
    \ warming. The rate of sea level rise increased from 2.1 \xB1 0.1 mm yr\u2013\
    1 to 3.4 \xB1 0.3 mm yr\u20131 from 1993 to 2015."
Methodology:
  3: Sea level change is determined by measuring time (age) and height of water with
    respect to datum levels. Modern mean sea level (MSL) datum level is used. Instrumental
    measurements of RSL are based on tide gauges and satellites.
  4: "Uses geological perspective, published back-stripped data, \u03B418O-Mg/Ca,\
    \ coral, marsh, and instrumental sea level records to reconstruct sea level changes."
  5: "Sea level obtained using benthic (Cibicidoides) foraminiferal \u03B418Obenthic\
    \ splice and \u03B418Oseawater using temperatures from Mg/Ca records. Smoothed\
    \ sea level estimates from \u03B418O and Mg/Ca (blue; obtained by interpolating\
    \ to 20 kyr intervals and using a 49-point Gaussian convolution filter, removing\
    \ periods shorter than 490 kyr) with backstripped onshore New Jersey estimates.\
    \ The New Jersey estimates for the Early to Middle Eocene were shifted by \u2013\
    50 m to compensate for long-term (2\u201310 million years) effects that are likely\
    \ due to changes in mantle dynamic topography."
  6: "\u03B418O and Mg/Ca-based estimates are used to determine sea level changes\
    \ and temperatures during the Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene. Sea level\
    \ change estimates are derived from benthic \u03B418O values."
  7: Uses coral data, GIA-corrected models, statistical analyses of tide gauge and
    satellite records, and process-model sea level projections. Includes statistical
    error estimates (1 and 2 sigma) and percentile ranges (17th to 83rd and 5th to
    95th).
  8: Statistical analysis of satellite and tide gauge records; simple regression model
    capturing the late twentieth to twenty-first century acceleration of sea level
    rise; analysis of global database of regional sea level records.
More Notes:
  5: The sea level record older than 48 million years is dashed because of uncertainties
    in the Mg/Ca record, particularly older than 48 Ma from Site 1209 due to high
    variability.
  6: Suggests that during the Middle to Late Miocene, the large EAIS was less sensitive
    to precessional and eccentricity forcing. Implicates dropping CO2 below a threshold
    of 300 ppm as contributing to large Northern Hemisphere ice ages.

Quantitative material:
  2: "The paper includes quantitative estimates such as historical sea levels being\
    \ 130 m below present during the Last Glacial Maximum and 22\xB110 m above present\
    \ during the Pliocene, with modern sea level rise rates at 3.2 mm yr\u20131 and\
    \ historical rates up to 47 mm yr\u20131 during deglaciation."
  3: CO2 concentrations increased from 280 ppm in ~1850 to 414 ppm in 2020, projected
    to 600-900 ppm this century. Greenland Ice Sheet contains 7.4 m of sea level equivalent;
    West Antarctic Ice Sheet contains 5.6 m of sea level equivalent; East Antarctic
    Ice Sheet contains 52 m of sea level equivalent; and mountain glaciers and ice
    caps contain <1 m of sea level equivalent.

    \ ephemeral ice sheets during the Late Cretaceous to Eocene in the interior of\
    \ Antarctica."
  6: "Sea level falls of 15-30 m at ca. 49, 47.8, 46.9, and 44.5 Ma; smaller falls\
    \ (~10\u201320 m) at 43.6, 42.9, and 40.8 Ma; a major rise of ~40 m to near ice-free\
    \ conditions at the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (40.1 Ma); a ~20 m drop (39.5\
    \ Ma); sea level fell 40 m during the Late Eocene; million year sea level falls\
    \ of 40\u201360 m in the Early Oligocene; Mi3a (14.8 Ma; ~30 m fall, ~0.7\xB0\
    C cooling), Mi3 (13.8 Ma; ~50 m fall, ~1.2\xB0C cooling), and Mi4 (12.8 Ma; 20\u2013\
    30 m sea level fall, ~1.0\xB0C cooling); Pliocene sea levels ~22\xB110 m above\
    \ present"
  7: "GMSL estimates from 30,000 years ago to 2020. Sea level projections until 2200.\
    \ Extrapolation of the acceleration indicates over 0.7 m of sea level rise by\
    \ 2100 and a ~12.5 mm yr \u20131 rate of rise in 2100."
  8: "Statistical analysis of satellite data shows a 1.6 \xB1 0.4 mm yr\u20131 rate\
    \ of sea level rise between 1900 and 2015, with the current acceleration beginning\
    \ in the late 1960s. Rate of sea level rise increased from 2.1 \xB1 0.1 mm yr\u2013\
    1 to 3.4 \xB1 0.3 mm yr\u20131 from 1993 to 2015."
