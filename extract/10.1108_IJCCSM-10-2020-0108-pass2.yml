Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (both positive and negative shocks)
  5: Positive and negative shocks of climate change, specifically increasing and decreasing
    average temperature (TEMP)
  6: Climate change (both positive and negative shocks)
  7: Average temperature as a proxy for climate change.
  8: Temperature increase (TEMP_i) and temperature decrease (TEMP_d) sequences, average
    temperature (TEMP)
  9: Temperature increases (TEMP_i and TEMP_d) are the drivers of risk.
  10: Temperature changes (both increases and decreases), climate policies, and the
    speed of conversion to a low-carbon economy.
  11: Climate change through positive and negative climate shocks affects financial
    stability asymmetrically.
  12: Temperature (TEMP), climate change, positive climate shocks, concentration of
    carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
  13: Positive and negative changes in CO2 concentration (CO2+ and CO2-), climate
    disasters
Highlights:
  1: Both positive and negative climate shocks harm financial stability; Asymmetric
    effect exists, with short-term positive shocks and long-term negative shocks having
    larger impacts; Long-run effects are more destructive than short-run effects.
  4: Revealing the nonlinear and asymmetric impact of climate change on financial
    stability from a short-term and long-term perspective in the context of China
  5: The analysis aims to determine the long-term transmission effects of both increasing
    and decreasing average temperatures on financial stability, as well as the short-term
    transmission effects of positive and negative climate shocks on financial stability.
  6: "The study investigates the asymmetric impact of climate change on financial\
    \ stability, considering both positive and negative shocks. The asymmetric dynamic\
    \ multipliers (M+h and M\u2212h) are calculated to show the transmission path."
  7: "China's financial stability index shows a rising trend, indicating that the\
    \ stability of the Chinese financial system is constantly improving. China\u2019\
    s financial stability index has obvious volatility characteristics, confirming\
    \ the financial instability hypothesis."
  8: The study analyzes the asymmetric impact of climate change on China's financial
    stability using a VAR model. Temperature increases and decreases are considered
    as separate drivers of risk.
  9: A shock to TEMP_i (temperature increase) has a significant negative impact on
    financial stability, which increases up to the fifth period and then stabilizes.
  10: Climate change has an asymmetric effect on financial stability. Too fast conversion
    to a low-carbon economy has a greater impact on financial stability than natural
    disasters caused by climate change. Drop in average temperature has a greater
    impact on financial stability than a rise in temperature in the short-term.
  11: Positive climate shocks have a greater immediate effect on financial stability
    than negative shocks, but negative shocks have a greater long-term effect.
  12: Climate change has a long-term negative asymmetry path to financial stability,
    but the degree of negative asymmetry is not large. The parameters and variance
    of the model are stable.
  13: Positive and negative changes in CO2 concentration both have statistically significant
    impacts on financial stability. There's evidence of asymmetry in the long-term
    effects of positive and negative changes in CO2 on financial stability.
Methodology:
  1: "Vector autoregression (VAR) model and NARDL model to assess the nonlinear asymmetric\
    \ effect of climate change on China\u2019s financial stability; monthly data from\
    \ 2002 to 2018"
  5: Uses a Non-linear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model to analyze the
    asymmetric transmission effects of positive and negative temperature shocks on
    financial stability. The model decomposes temperature changes into positive and
    negative partial sums and examines their individual long-term and short-term impacts
    on financial stability. Hypothesis testing using t-statistics and F-statistics
    is employed to determine the presence of a long-term nonlinear equilibrium nexus
    between climate change and financial stability.
  6: Wald statistics are used to test for short-term and long-term asymmetry in the
    impact of climate shocks on financial stability. The asymmetric dynamic multiplier
    is calculated to observe the asymmetric transmission path of climate change to
    financial stability. Min-Max standardization is used to process the data.
  7: Factor analysis is used to create the China Financial Stability Index. Bartlett
    and KMO tests are used to determine suitability of data for factor analysis. Weighted
    average method based on variance contribution rate of common factors is used to
    calculate the financial stability index. HP filter decomposition is used.
  8: Vector Autoregression (VAR) model is used to analyze the asymmetric impact of
    climate change on China's financial stability. The temperature increase (TEMP_i)
    and decrease (TEMP_d) sequences are defined using equations (12) and (13), involving
    the current temperature (TEMPt) and a constant C0=138. Unit root tests (ADF and
    PP) are performed to ensure stationarity of the time series. The optimal lag order
    for the VAR model is determined using LR, FPE, AIC, SC, and HQ criteria.
  9: VAR models with second-order lags are used to analyze the relationship between
    temperature changes and financial stability. Impulse response functions are used
    to analyze the impact of shocks to TEMP_i and TEMP_d on financial stability.
  10: VAR model for short-term effects; NARDL model for long-term and short-term nonlinear
    and asymmetric effects. NARDL model uses unit root tests and selects lags p=1
    and q=1. Applicable for data meeting data stationarity requirements.
  11: NARDL (Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag) model used for asymmetry and
    co-integration tests between climate change and financial stability.
  12: NARDL model, cumulative sum of squares recursive residuals test
  13: NARDL (Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag) model is used to test the relationship
    between CO2 concentrations and financial stability. Co-integration and asymmetry
    tests (WLR, WSR, tBDM, FPSS) are performed.
More Notes:
  1: Focuses on the nexus between climate change and financial stability in China.
  4: The influence of climate change on financial stability is not gradual, but it
    is instantly multiplied several times like the domino effect when the temperature
    exceeds a certain threshold
  6: Financial stability is measured using an index system that includes financial
    development, macroeconomic situation, and the functioning of financial markets,
    based on nine indicators.
  7: Normalization of indicators is performed using max-min scaling. Negative indicators
    are inverted to ensure all indicators have the same direction of influence on
    the financial stability index.
  8: The time frame of the data used in the analysis appears to span from 2002 to
    2018 based on Figure 1.
  9: TEMP_d is defined as a second-order lag of temperature. The frequency of climate
    disasters is indirectly linked to temperature increases.
  11: The study identifies significant asymmetric transmission effects between climate
    change and financial stability in both long and short-term analyses.
  12: Robustness test uses concentration of carbon dioxide as an indicator of climate
    change.
