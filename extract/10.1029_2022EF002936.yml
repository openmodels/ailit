Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change and air pollution are impacting crop yields in China.
  3: Aerosols exert impacts on crops mainly through the interference with atmospheric
    radiative fluxes, so the column-integrated quantity AOD is appropriate to be used
    in our analysis.
  4: Climate factors (temperature, precipitation), aerosol pollutants (AOD)
  6: Air pollution (AOD, surface ozone), temperature increases, and changes in precipitation
    patterns during the growing season.
  8: Climate change (temperature and precipitation variations) and pollution (aerosol
    optical depth (AOD) and surface ozone).
  9: Aerosol variations, surface ozone levels, temperature increase, and precipitation
    changes.
  10: Increased temperature, precipitation, and air pollution including ozone and
    particulate matter are impacting crop yields.
Highlights:
  1: Recent air pollution abatement in China has led to net crop yield gains, masking
    losses due to climate change; future climate change effects will dominate, leading
    to reduced crop yields.
  3: The predicted crop yields by the regression models generally agree well with
    the reported yield, with the correlation coefficient square (R 2) being 0.79,
    0.81, and 0.89 for rice, maize, and winter wheat.
  4: Aerosol pollution (AOD) has differing impacts on crop yields before and after
    2010. Technological innovation positively impacts crop yields, but the rate of
    increase is leveling off.
  6: Air pollution, specifically increased AOD, significantly reduces crop yields.
    Winter wheat is the most sensitive crop to particulate pollution. Surface ozone
    has complex trends, with recent abrupt increases, and its effect on crops is still
    not well understood. Precipitation is found to be the largest contributor to changes
    in crop yields compared to temperature and surface ozone.
  8: Reduction in aerosols is a key driver of crop variations on the interannual time
    scale. Moderate reduction in wheat yield under climate change during 2006-2018,
    generally smaller than 2%.
  9: "Temperature increase is the most critical factor for all three crop types. For\
    \ rice and maize, climate variability and global warming dominate over pollution\
    \ factors in determining future yields. For winter wheat, the net yield trend\
    \ during 2020\u20132050 is positive due to aerosol reduction."
  10: Recent abatement of anthropogenic emissions results in a net crop gain, offsetting
    losses from increased temperature and precipitation.
Methodology:
  1: Develops crop yield prediction models using historical crop data and climate
    and pollution records in China since 1980; uses machine-learning to develop surface
    ozone concentration dataset.
  3: "To explore crop responses to various factors, we develop a statistical yield\
    \ model for each crop using the following panel regression approach (Equation\_\
    \ 1):  where          ,        ,       and     are the growing-season averaged\
    \ 2-m temperature, daily precipitation, AOD, and MDA8 O3, respectively, during\
    \ 1980\u20132018"
  4: Statistical yield model; bootstrapping method with 1,000 crop models generated
    from 75% observations each year to derive confidence intervals; dominance analysis
    to calculate the fractional contribution of different factors; models also tested
    with interaction terms and nonlinear trend variables.
  6: Crop yield models (Equation 1) are derived from historical data (1980-2018) to
    show the impacts of air pollution and climate change. Dominance analysis is used
    to assess the percentage contribution of AOD, surface ozone, temperature, and
    precipitation to the spatial variations of yields for each crop.
  8: Panel regression model using historical climate and pollution records. The model
    estimates crop yields under different climate and pollution scenarios, comparing
    2006-2010 and 2014-2018 to a 1980-1984 baseline. Future projections to 2050 are
    based on CMIP6 climate model ensembles with the SSP5-8.5 emission scenario, holding
    technology constant at 2015-2020 levels.
  9: "The future change in yield is estimated from the difference between projected\
    \ growing-season climate or pollution scenarios in 2021\u20132050 and the averaged\
    \ scenarios in 2015\u20132020 under RCP8.5."
  10: The analysis uses robust statistical models and machine learning to predict
    crop yields based on factors such as temperature, precipitation, ozone, and aerosols,
    accounting for technological and policy changes over recent decades.
More Notes:
  3: The study uses province-level observations in China.
  4: The model assumes equal weight to different provinces regardless of their share
    in national crop production, thus providing an overall average impact. Interaction
    terms between variables do not significantly improve the model's predictability.
  6: 'The study focuses on three major crops in China: maize, winter wheat, and rice.
    The analysis considers spatial and temporal variations in AOD and surface ozone
    during the growing season of each crop type. Emission control policies in China
    have influenced AOD trends.'
  8: "The study focuses on China. The SSP5-8.5 scenario projects a \u223C2\xB0C increase\
    \ in global temperature in the 2050s compared to 1995-2014. The study aims to\
    \ isolate the effects of temperature, precipitation, aerosol, and surface ozone\
    \ levels on future yields."
  9: The study uses CMIP6 model outputs and converts O3MM to MDA8 using an empirical
    relationship.
  10: Future projections are based on historical response data, noting that continued
    removal of aerosols may negatively affect yields due to absence of diffuse light
    fertilization. There's a need for long-term projections to develop adaptation
    strategies.

Quantitative material:

    \ the reported yield (Figure\_ 1), with the correlation coefficient square (R\
    \ 2) being 0.79, 0.81, and 0.89 for rice, maize, and winter wheat."
  4: Estimates relative yield changes (RYCs, in %) in 2006-2010 (or 2014-2018) compared
    to 1980-1984 (or 2006-2010) due to individual factors; 90% confidence intervals
    of the coefficients and RYC estimates are calculated.
  6: "Crop yield is reduced by 1.7%\u20135.9% per 0.1 increase in AOD. The mean AOD\
    \ during the growing season is 0.34, 0.35, and 0.42 for rice, maize, and wheat,\
    \ respectively. The mean MDA8 ozone during the growing season is 47.1, 49.7, and\
    \ 37.8 ppbv for rice, maize, and wheat, respectively. The contributions of surface\
    \ ozone, temperature, and precipitation to spatial variations of yields are quantified\
    \ (e.g., for maize: Surf. O\u2083: 26.9%, Temp.: 11.0%, Precip.: 62.1%)."

    \ \u22120.8%, \u22122.5%, and \u22120.6% per decade for rice, maize, and wheat,\
    \ respectively."
