Drivers of Risk:
  1: "El Ni\xF1o events, natural climate variability, changes in the mean climate\
    \ (increased greenhouse gases), delayed monsoon onset, changes in the annual cycle\
    \ of rainfall."
  4: Delayed monsoon onset (exceeding the 30-day threshold) and changes in the amplitude
    of the seasonal cycle of rainfall.
  5: Increased temperatures, altered precipitation patterns (wet-season delays), and
    CO2 concentrations are identified as key drivers impacting rice yields.
Highlights:
  1: A marked increase in the probability of a 30-day delay in monsoon onset in 2050
    due to changes in the mean climate. The study highlights the need for adaptation
    strategies in Indonesian rice agriculture, including increased investments in
    water storage, drought-tolerant crops, crop diversification, and early warning
    systems.
  4: A 30-day delay in monsoon onset is very likely to occur more frequently in 2050.
    Total rainfall is expected to increase in AMJ and decrease in JAS. Extremely dry
    conditions in JAS could preclude the planting of rice and all other crops without
    irrigation by 2050.
  5: Adaptation measures, including rice policy adjustments, water storage and irrigation
    infrastructure, drought-tolerant rice varieties, and crop diversification, are
    considered for food security.
Methodology:
  1: "Risk assessment framework examining the impact of El Ni\xF1o events and natural\
    \ variability on rice agriculture in 2050 using climate model outputs (Intergovernmental\
    \ Panel on Climate Change AR4 suite) and empirical downscaling models. The analysis\
    \ covers West and Central Java and East Java and Bali, focusing on the impact\
    \ of a 30-day monsoon delay."
  4: Climate models downscaled by using three Empirical Downscaling Methods (EDMs)
    are used to project changes in rainfall patterns. Fifteen GCMs ran the A2 scenario,
    and 19 GCMs ran the B1 scenario, for the year 2050.
  5: The paper employs least-squares regression models to relate crop production variables
    to observed precipitation for 1979 to 2004; uses accumulated rainfall to define
    monsoon onset; constructs Empirical Dynamical Models (EDMs) based on covariance
    analysis to project future precipitation patterns using large-scale circulation
    fields as predictors and regional precipitation as the predictand, assuming changes
    in large-scale circulation strongly project onto dominant annual cycles; three
    EDMs using various combinations of observed large-scale fields as predictors are
    constructed (850-mb specific humidity, 850-mb specific humidity and sea-level
    pressure, 850-mb specific humidity, upper (200-mb)- and lower (850-mb)-level zonal
    winds); and statistical analysis is conducted using Stata 9.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on precipitation rather than temperature because of the significant
    and well-documented links between precipitation and production in Indonesia. It
    uses a threshold of a 30-day delay in monsoon onset beyond which significant impacts
    on the country's rice economy are likely to occur.
  5: The study focuses on Java and Bali and should be seen as a starting point for
    assessing climate change risks regarding rice and agriculture; the paper aims
    to identify a climate variable with clear effects on rice productivity and a threshold
    beyond which productivity loss is significant to determine the probability of
    exceeding the threshold under future climate conditions.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Rice production deficits, impacts on agricultural output, rural incomes, and
    staple food prices, availability and access to staple food commodities (food security).
  4: Impacts on Indonesian rice agriculture and food security.
  5: Rice production and yields are considered as key outcomes affected by climate
    change, impacting food security and potentially necessitating rice policy adjustments
    including imports and stock adjustments.
Quantitative material:
  1: Increase in probability of a 30-day delay in monsoon onset in 2050 from 9-18%
    today to 30-40% at the upper tail of the distribution in Java and Bali. Precipitation
    increase later in the crop year (April-June) of >10% but a decrease (up to 75%
    at the tail) in precipitation later in the dry season (July-September).
  4: Probability of exceeding the 30-day monsoon threshold in 2050 for West Java/Central
    Java and East Java/Bali under A2 and B1 scenarios; Projected change in total rainfall
    for April-June (AMJ) and July-September (JAS) under the A2 scenario; Rainfall
    is projected to decline by 10-25% on average and by as much as 50% in West/Central
    Java and 75% in East Java/Bali in JAS.
  5: "A 1\xB0C increase in minimum temperature during the dry season is associated\
    \ with a 10% decrease in rice yields based on experimental rice plots at the International\
    \ Rice Research Institute."
