  7: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  5: Climate change impacts on agriculture (crops, pests, diseases), water resources
    (streamflow, flooding, drought), and sea level rise.
  7: Extreme weather events (fires, flooding, storm surges) and the impact of climate
    variability and change on sectors like agriculture (e.g., rooibos tea farming).
  15: No relevant information
Highlights:
  5: Largely negative projected impacts for key cereal crops (maize, wheat).
  7: "South Africa's 2011 National Climate Change Response White Paper is the first\
    \ coherent outline of national government\u2019s responsibilities relating to\
    \ mitigation and adaptation."
  15: No relevant information
Methodology:
  5: Hydrological models using downscaled climate projections are used to assess water
    sector impacts; crop modeling approaches (DSSAT, APSIM) and climate envelope distribution
    modeling are used for agriculture.
  7: Cross-sectional (Ricardian) method used to measure possible economic impact of
    climate change on crop farming in South Africa.
  15: No relevant information
More Notes:
  5: The built environment has not been assessed in LTAS, representing a significant
    gap.
  7: The paper mentions participatory modeling approaches and adaptation designs directly
    involving stakeholders used to develop locally relevant adaptation plans for agriculture
    and water management.
  15: This page consists of references; therefore, it does not contain original analysis,
    macroeconomic or fiscal information. Some studies referenced might contain information
    relevant to the categories, but that information is not present on this page.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  5: Possible projected increase in irrigation demand due to climate change.
  7: Benefit of interventions in ecosystem restoration for increasing resilience to
    climate change and broader community benefits, such as wetland restoration.
  15: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  5: "Increase in average annual irrigation demand in the order of 4\u20136% is projected."
