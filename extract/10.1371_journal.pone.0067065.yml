Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sustained hotter, drier conditions most likely associated with reductions in
    forage quality; higher temperatures reduce nitrogen availability in grasslands
    and forage quality declines.
  6: Climate change leading to reduced forage quality and weight gain in cattle.
Highlights:
  1: Long-term effects of higher temperatures are likely to accrue over time as nitrogen
    availability in grasslands is reduced and forage quality declines, leading to
    potential economic losses in cattle production.
  6: Warming-induced reductions in weight gain in cattle may result in substantial
    economic costs for US cattle producers.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of a dataset of over a quarter million bison weights distributed across
    22 US herds spanning a large range of climates; analyzed with respect to differences
    in geographic patterns of climate and interannual variation in climate.
  6: Extrapolation of observed reductions in weight gain for bison due to climate
    change to domestic cattle; no specific geographic or temporal restrictions mentioned.

  2: This page does not provide specific information related to macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes, drivers of risk, quantitative data on economic outcomes, methodology
    for assessing economic impacts, highlights of economic analysis, or additional
    relevant notes. It focuses on the impact of climate change on bison body mass
    across different herds in North America.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Potential economic consequences of higher temperatures due to decreased weight
    gain in US cattle could be on the order of US$1B per 1uC increase in temperature.
  6: Economic costs of warming for cattle producers.
Quantitative material:
  1: US$1B per 1uC increase in temperature (potential economic consequences due to
    decreased weight gain in US cattle).
  6: 1uC warming could cost US cattle producers in the range of US$1 billion either
    through direct reductions in weight gain or costs of dietary supplement to compensate
    for weight gain reduction.
