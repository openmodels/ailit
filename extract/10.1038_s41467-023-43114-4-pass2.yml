Highlights:
  1: Accounting for TC impacts substantially increases the global social cost of carbon,
    particularly for major greenhouse gas emitting countries like India, USA, China,
    Taiwan, and Japan.
  2: Including TC effects does not affect the obtained responses to temperature.
  3: TC strikes reduce growth in the short-, mid-, and long-term; cumulative growth
    losses increase with the number of lag years considered. Heterogeneous exposure
    of countries to TCs leads to substantially different induced growth losses.
  4: For 37 out of 41 TC-affected countries, growth losses increase with GMT, and
    growth in high-income countries is negatively affected by TCs.
  5: Quantifies the discounted annual damage from tropical cyclones under various
    scenarios and uncertainties. Provides estimates of per-capita DAD for specific
    countries and relates it to household income. Estimates the tropical cyclone-induced
    SCC (TC-SCC) and the relative increase in SCC due to TCs.
  6: TC-induced increases in SCC are notable for large emitters. Discount rate has
    the largest impact on the SCC estimates. Persistence of growth losses in the economic
    system and accounting for risk aversion are important.
  7: Low- and middle-income countries face significant relative economic challenges
    from TCs, with the damages potentially being comparable to those in the USA when
    expressed relative to household income.
  8: Key outcome is that TCs' contribution to SCC can substantially increase previous
    estimates when explicitly accounted for.
  9: The study links simulated TC impacts with socioeconomic impacts, estimating country-level
    GDP changes related to TCs and temperature.
  10: The study finds that the relationship between variables cannot be explained
    by RCP-independent coefficients alone and needs to account for structural dependence
    on RCPs.

Methodology:
  1: Derives temperature-dependent damage functions for 41 TC-affected countries to
    quantify the country-level SCC induced by the persistent growth effects of damaging
    TCs.
  2: "A modeling framework is presented to quantify future TC damages, incorporating\
    \ historical growth responses to TC strikes, probabilistic event-based projections\
    \ of TC damages, and country-specific temperature-dependent damage functions.\
    \ A three-way \uFB01xed effects panel model is employed, using annual national\
    \ shares of people exposed to TCs for different lag-years as exogenous predictors,\
    \ while controlling for temperature's impact on growth."
  3: Scenario analysis and probabilistic methods (bootstrapping, TC impact emulator)
    are used to project TC damages from 2010-2100, considering compounding uncertainties.
    A maximum entropy bootstrapping method is used to capture the uncertainties associated
    with the historical growth estimates with 1200 bootstraps per country.
  4: The study uses event-based, country-level temperature-dependent damage functions,
    and a mixed-effects modeling approach for regression analysis to assess the contribution
    of TCs to the SCC.
  5: "Calculates DAD using different RCPs, SSPs, and discounting approaches.  Quantifies\
    \ uncertainties in the main specification (RCP6.0-SSP2, and Ricke\u2019s discounting\
    \ choice). The paper uses the statistical relationship between per-capita GDP\
    \ growth and population-weighted annual mean temperatures over land in a common\
    \ regression framework with TC impacts."
  6: 'Combines process-based modeling of population exposure to TCs with an empirical
    growth model. Applies the framework to TCs but suggests it could be extended to
    other extreme weather events. Considers uncertainty dimensions. Employs two complementary
    metrics: DAD and TC-SCC.'
  8: The analysis uses a temperature-dependent damage function for TCs, considering
    both direct damages and persistence in the economic system.
  9: They use climate model simulations (HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5, IPSL-CM5A-LR, GFDL-ESM2M)
    and RCP scenarios to generate probabilistic TC tracks. They use the CLIMADA tool
    to generate wind footprints and calculate population exposure. They use a three-way
    fixed effects panel model to estimate the national GDPpc growth responses. A bootstrapping
    strategy is implemented to account for uncertainties related to economic growth.
    They apply an ordinary least squares regression approach.
  10: The analysis uses a mixed-effects model to derive temperature-dependent damage
    functions, regressing growth rate changes relative to a baseline with the change
    in global mean temperature.
  11: The analysis uses a regression approach to estimate the social cost of carbon
    (SCC), incorporating tropical cyclone exposure and temperature-dependent damage
    functions.
  13: The method was designed by H.K., C.O., and T.V. T.G. and T.V. provided the TC
    exposure. C.S. generated the historical population-weighted temperature time series.
    F.P. calculated the SCC. H.K. and T.V. conducted the rest of the simulations.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the long-term impacts of TCs on economic growth, addressing
    a gap in current social cost of carbon estimates.
  2: "The study estimates the long-term response of economic growth rates to TC strikes\
    \ for 41 TC-affected countries over the historical period 1981\u20132015."
  3: 'The study identifies and maps out six relevant uncertainty dimensions (UD) related
    to TC damage projections: future greenhouse gas emissions, socioeconomic development,
    normative assumptions on discounting, historical growth response of countries
    to TCs, response of TC impacts to future greenhouse gas emissions, and response
    of temperature to a greenhouse gas emission pulse.'
  4: The analysis finds that the global sum of the DAD is positive across all scenarios,
    and growth losses do not depend on development level but on country-specific characteristics.
  7: The paper suggests SCC values are strongly influenced by the choice of discount
    rates and socioeconomic pathways.
  8: The analysis is limited to wind field damages of TCs and considers damage projections
    as a lower bound due to the exclusion of storm surge and rainfall.
  9: "The study uses a slightly larger range for global mean temperature variability\
    \ (0.5\xB0C - 1.5\xB0C) than the HadCRUT5 data for 2005-2020 (0.8\xB0C - 1.3\xB0\
    C) to allow for larger probabilistic variability."

Quantitative material:
  1: Accounting for TC impacts increases the global SCC by more than 20%; median global
    SCC increases from US$ 173 to US$ 212 per tonne of CO2 under a middle-of-the-road
    future emission and socioeconomic development scenario.
  2: Average historical responses of per-capita GDP growth to tropical cyclone exposure
    as a function of lag years for selected countries and on global average.
  3: The average annual growth losses for strongly exposed countries such as Japan
    (1.63%) or the Philippines (2.62%) were in the historical period on average 10
    and 15 times higher than for the only partially exposed USA (0.17%).
  4: The analysis presents quantitative data such as median global discounted damage
    (DAD) which ranges from 0.18% to 1.13% of global GDP depending on scenarios.
  5: "Median global discounted annual damage (DAD) in Trillion US$ and relative to\
    \ global world product (GWP). Country-level per-capita DAD averaged over the period\
    \ 2010\u20132100. Median average per-capita DAD relative to 2019 average household\
    \ income. Median global SCC of US$/tCO2 173 (2005 constant)."
  6: Temperature-dependent damage functions for tropical cyclone-induced growth losses.
    Increase in median Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) due to TCs. Examples of SCC increases
    for specific countries (USA, Japan, Taiwan, China, India) due to TCs. Uncertainty
    intervals for SCC estimates.
  7: The page provides median SCC estimates with and without TC effects, noting a
    quadrupling of SCC estimates over the last decade.
  8: The page states that accounting for TC damages increases the SCC by 22.2% globally
    and by 44.4% in TC-affected countries.
  9: The study generates 1200 probabilistic time series of TC tracks for each ocean
    basin, for various GCM-RCP combinations. It finds coefficients for lag numbers
    between L=0 and L=15. It assesses that the temperature effects estimated with
    the different models are not significantly different from the effects reported
    by Burke et al., and omitting TC impact terms does not affect temperature coefficients.
  10: The paper identifies that the hypotheses regarding the independence of structural
    coefficients from RCPs have to be rejected at the 5% level of significance for
    58.5% to 86.5% of samples across various dimensions.
