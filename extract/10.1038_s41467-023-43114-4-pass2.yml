Drivers of Risk:
  1: Tropical cyclones (TCs)
  2: Tropical Cyclones (TCs), different emission (Representative Concentration Pathways
    (RCPs)), socioeconomic development (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)), economic
    discounting scenario combinations, temperature change
  3: Future greenhouse gas emissions, socioeconomic development, normative assumptions
    on discounting, historical growth response of countries to TCs, response of TC
    impacts to future greenhouse gas emissions, and response of temperature to a greenhouse
    gas emission pulse
  4: Tropical cyclones (TCs), global mean temperature (GMT), greenhouse gas emissions,
    changes in atmospheric circulation (shear winds), sea level rise
  5: The primary drivers of risk identified are tropical cyclone impacts, with uncertainties
    arising from socioeconomic pathways and discount rates.
  6: Global Mean Temperature (GMT) change relative to pre-industrial levels, Representative
    Concentration Pathways (RCPs), country income level, and discounting choices.
  7: Tropical Cyclones (TC) and annual temperatures.
  8: Tropical cyclones (TCs) and their wind fields; persistence of TC damages in the
    economic system.
  9: Impacts of temperature changes and exposure to strong TC winds on economic growth.
  10: "Tropical cyclones (TC) and temperature changes (\u0394T) induced by different\
    \ Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\
    \ (SSPs). The specific RCPs considered are RCP2.6, 6.0, and 8.5, along with a\
    \ 'no further climate change' baseline scenario. The SSPs considered are SSP2\
    \ and SSP5."
  11: Tropical cyclones and temperature-dependent damage.
Highlights:
  1: Accounting for TC impacts substantially increases the global SCC, suggesting
    the benefits of climate policies could be underestimated.
  2: Estimates of the impact of TC on DAD and SCC
  3: "TC strikes reduce growth in the short-, mid-, and long-term; Cumulative growth\
    \ losses first monotonically increase with the number of lag years considered\
    \ before they somewhat remain constant for 6\u201313 lags; The heterogeneous exposure\
    \ of countries to TCs leads to substantially different induced growth losses."
  4: Growth losses robustly increase with GMT for 37 out of the 41 TC-affected countries
    considered. Growth losses do not depend on the development level but rather on
    country-specific characteristics.
  6: Tropical cyclones induce growth losses, and these losses scale quasi-universally
    with global mean temperature change. The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) increases
    substantially when accounting for Tropical Cyclones. The discount rate has the
    largest impact on SCC estimates. Countries with larger economies (and GHG emissions)
    experience larger increases in SCC due to TCs. The USA experiences the largest
    increase in SCC due to TCs in absolute terms.
  7: Tropical cyclones increase the social cost of carbon. Lower- and middle-income
    countries face larger relative adaptation challenges due to tropical cyclone damage
    when measured as a percentage of household income.
  8: Explicitly accounting for TC impacts and their persistence increases the global
    SCC by 22.2% and the SCC in TC-affected countries by 44.4%. TC damages can be
    substantial already, driving up the country-level SCC of major emitters.
  9: Findings indicate non-significant differences when comparing temperature effects
    with Burke et al.'s results; significance of TCs impact on GDP growth is tested.
  10: "The study finds a structural dependence of TC-induced growth losses on RCPs.\
    \ The relationship between the exogenous and endogenous variables cannot be explained\
    \ by RCP-independent coefficients \u03B3r,b,li and \u03C9r,b,li alone."
  11: The Tropical Cyclone-induced SCC (TC-SCC) is defined and quantified.
Methodology:
  1: Derives temperature-dependent damage functions for 41 TC-affected countries to
    quantify the country-level SCC induced by the persistent growth effects of damaging
    TCs.
  2: "A modeling framework to quantify future TC damages globally. Three-way \uFB01\
    \ xed effects panel model with annual national shares of people exposed to TCs\
    \ for different lag-years as exogenous predictors, controlling for temperature\
    \ on growth, TC climatology with global warming."
  3: 'A combination of scenario analysis and probabilistic methods (bootstrapping)
    are used. Six uncertainty dimensions are considered. The first two dimensions
    cover assumptions on future emissions and socioeconomic development. The third
    dimension captures normative assumptions on how global society weighs future compared
    to present TC damages (discount rates). The fourth, fifth, and sixth dimensions
    cover structural modelling uncertainties: historical growth response of countries
    to TCs (bootstrapping), changes of TC impacts under future GHG emissions (statistical
    TC emulator based on four different global climate models), and response of global
    mean temperature to the emission of an additional ton of CO2 over the course of
    100 years.'
  4: "Event-based, country-level temperature-dependent damage functions for TCs are\
    \ derived.  The empirical growth model is used to translate the shares of affected\
    \ people into deviations of the national GDP pathways.  F-tests are used to test\
    \ for structural dependencies of the relationship between GMT and TC-induced growth\
    \ rate changes. A mixed-effects modeling approach accounts for dependencies. An\
    \ approach introduced by Ricke et al.40 is used to estimate the SCC induced by\
    \ TCs.  This evaluates the difference in future GDP per\u2013capita projections\
    \ under climate damage with and without an additional emission pulse.  The analysis\
    \ covers 41 TC-affected countries."
  5: Analysis is based on Nordhaus's DICE model and Ricke et al.'s discounting choice,
    involving simulations across socioeconomic pathways and discount rates.
  6: Combines process-based modeling of population exposure to Tropical Cyclones (TCs)
    with an empirical growth model. Uses a mixed-effects model to estimate the relationship
    between GMT change and growth losses. Accounts for uncertainty dimensions in the
    modeling. Employs Damage Assessment Data (DAD) and TC-SCC metrics.
  7: The study uses a Damage Assessment based on income (DAD) analysis. The analysis
    accounts for uncertainty dimensions using 7,200,000 realizations per country.
    The paper presents SCC estimates using different discount rates, including those
    from the Stern review and Ricke et al.
  8: Empirical country-level temperature-dependent damage functions are derived, accounting
    for the persistence of damages in the economic system. Historical economic growth
    rates are derived from a harmonized data set of national time series of annual
    purchasing power parity-adjusted (PPP) per-capita GDP. TC track emulator regresses
    frequency and intensity statistics of synthetic TCs with landfall.
  9: "Three-way fixed effects panel model based on historical data, using bootstrapping\
    \ to account for uncertainties; analysis applicable for the period 1981\u2013\
    2015."
  10: The study uses a mixed-effects model to regress changes in growth rates relative
    to a baseline with changes in global mean temperature (GMT). It tests for structural
    breaks in the intercept and slope coefficients across SSPs and RCPs using F-tests.
    It calculates SCC following the approach by Ricke et al. (2018), using a pulse
    of 1 gigatonne of carbon (GtC) in 2025. The study considers the period 2010-2200
    for SCC calculation.
  11: The SCC is calculated by summing over all countries and then analyzed and produced
    figures in Python 3.9 with CLI-MADA 3.3.3 and statsmodels 0.13.5. A discrete time
    definition of discount rates is used. The TC-SCC is defined as the difference
    between the SCC with and without the contribution of Tropical Cyclones. The model
    to generate the probabilistic TC tracks is proprietary but all remaining code
    used for the regression analyses and generation of future exposure indicators
    are available.
More Notes:
  1: 'The increase in SCC is mainly driven by TC-affected major greenhouse gas emitting
    countries: India, USA, China, Taiwan, and Japan.'
  2: The analysis accounts for the persistence of damages in the economic system.
  3: The analysis uses a model with eight lag years. The discounted annual damage
    (DAD) is estimated over the period 2010-2100. SSP2 (middle of the road) and SSP5
    (fossil-fuel-based economic growth) are used to account for dependencies regarding
    future population and economic development.
  4: The relationship between GMT and TC-induced growth rate changes is independent
    of the SSP scenarios at the 10% level of significance but weakly dependent upon
    the RCPs. Historically implemented adaptation measures may not suffice to compensate
    for climate change-induced loss increases in the future, even in high-income countries.
  7: The study acknowledges that their DAD analysis likely underestimates the economic
    implications for lower-income populations. The paper resolves the impacts from
    annual temperatures and TCs explicitly, which may still implicitly account for
    other impact channels such as health impacts.
  8: Damage estimates are based solely on the wind fields of the storms, neglecting
    TC-related rainfall and storm surge. Future adaptation measures may reduce the
    vulnerability of countries to TCs, leading to an overestimation of damages. Countries'
    growth response to future TCs mimics their historical response.
  10: The study uses bias-corrected CMIP5-GCMs (HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5, IPSL-CM5A-LR,
    and GFDL-ESM2M) and 100 probabilistic TC time series.
  11: The paper relies on multiple data sources and climate models for its calculations,
    and offers open access to most code used.
