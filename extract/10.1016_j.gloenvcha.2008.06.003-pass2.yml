Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change resulting in further higher temperatures and worsening rainfall
    patterns, together with the already scarce water resources.
  5: Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring temperatures; Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring
    precipitation; Soil types (vertisols, acrisols, arenasols, xerosols); Mean runoff;
    Irrigated farms; Farm type (large-scale farms)
  6: Climate variables (temperature and precipitation), soil types (acrisols, arenosols,
    xerosols), mean runoff
  7: Temperature and precipitation changes, soil types (acrisols, arenosols, vertisols,
    and xerosols), and runoff.
  8: "Changes in temperature (1\xB0C increase) and precipitation (1 mm/month increase)."
  9: 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, 1 mm/month increase in precipitation
  10: Climate change impacts net revenues of crop-farming activities, particularly
    influenced by changes in temperature and precipitation.
  11: Temperature increases, precipitation decreases, variability of rainfall, seasonal
    differences in rainfall
  12: Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring temperatures squared; Spring temperature; Summer,
    Fall, Winter, and Spring precipitation; Summer and Winter precipitation squared;
    Fall and Spring precipitation squared; Soil vertisols, acrisols, arenosols, and
    xerosols
Highlights:
  1: Crop net revenues are expected to fall by as much as 90% by 2100 with small-scale
    farmers been most affected.
  5: Irrigated farms had the highest net revenues, while dryland farms had the lowest.
    Runoff seems to better explain changes in crop net revenues.
  6: Climate variables have significant influences on crop net revenues in South Africa.
    Non-linear relationships exist between climate variables and crop net revenues,
    especially for precipitation. Irrigation is a significant positive influence on
    crop net revenues, as is the farm type (large-scale farms tend to have higher
    net revenues).
  7: Increases in precipitation will generally lead to increases in net revenues except
    for small scale farms with more significant impacts for dryland farms; increases
    in precipitation during the summer/fall farming season will affect net revenues
    negatively due to the strong influence of the fall period.
  8: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature generally leads to an increase in mean annual\
    \ crop net revenue. A 1 mm/month increase in precipitation results in varying\
    \ impacts, with some provinces experiencing benefits and others negative effects."
  9: "Dryland farms and small-scale farmers are more negatively affected by increased\
    \ temperatures and decreased rainfall. Irrigated farms are least affected. Crop\
    \ net revenues are expected to fall by US$ 5.14\u201316.26 (or 1.7\u20135.3%)\
    \ per hectare for South Africa by 2050, with even larger decreases by 2100."
  10: Irrigated farms are cushioned against adverse climate effects, whereas dryland
    farms are more vulnerable.
  11: Climate change impacts on agriculture, especially in the summer, are real, and
    small-scale farms are the most affected. Adaptation could reduce these negative
    effects. Policies should be directed at taking advantage of gains and reducing
    losses, by identifying current coping mechanisms. Irrigation is important for
    controlling the adverse effects of climate.
  12: Climate and soil variables have significant effects on crop farming net revenue,
    varying across different farming types (irrigated, dryland, etc.). The impact
    of squared terms of temperature and precipitation is also considered.
Methodology:
  1: Uses a revised Ricardian model and data from farm household surveys, long-term
    climate data, major soils and runoffs to assess the economic impact of climate
    change on crop farming in South Africa.
  5: Revised Ricardian model estimated using STATA; Quantile regression (qreg) used
    to correct for heteroscedasticity. Reduced form of the net revenue model is estimated
    to address endogeneity.
  6: Regression analysis is used to estimate the impact of climate, soil, and hydrology
    variables on crop net revenues. Models are estimated for the full sample of farms,
    as well as for irrigated vs. dryland farms and large-scale vs. small-scale farms.
    Climate impacts are assessed using climate scenarios for 2050 and 2100.
  7: Estimation of marginal effects of temperature and precipitation on crop net revenues
    using an econometric model. Models consider different farm types (irrigated vs.
    dryland, large-scale vs. small-scale) and soil types.
  8: Regression analysis using a full sample model (Table 2) to assess marginal impacts
    at agro-ecological and provincial levels, based on their respective means. Elasticity
    is estimated as (Marginal effects * Mean of corresponding climate variable) /
    Mean of dependent variable (crop net revenue).
  9: Estimates marginal impacts of climate variables on crop net revenues. Examines
    climate scenarios from Strzepek and McCluskey (2006) using climate models (CSIRO2,
    HadCM3, PCM) with A2 emission scenarios. Uses a Water Balance (WatBal) model and
    General Circulation Model (GCM)-based climate change scenarios. The estimated
    model is in Appendix A, and predicted changes are for 2050 and 2100. Baseline
    climate is 1961-1990.
  10: Utilizes a revised Ricardian model to assess climate change impacts on crop-farming
    in South Africa, incorporating factors such as temperature, precipitation, runoff,
    and irrigation.
  11: The study uses three plausible climate scenarios for South Africa, projecting
    temperature increases and precipitation changes by 2100 to predict the impact
    on crop net revenues.
  12: Ricardian approach, regressions using climate and soil variables to explain
    crop farming net revenue, estimated for full sample, irrigated, dryland, large-scale,
    and small-scale farms.
More Notes:
  1: The study suggests policies should take advantage of relative benefits across
    seasons, farming systems, and spatially, to make climate change potentially beneficial.
  5: Multicollinearity controlled for by dropping problematic variables. Obvious outliers
    were excluded from the estimation. The paper acknowledges the problems of endogeneity,
    heteroscedasticity, multicollinearity and the impact of outliers.
  6: Summer and winter temperatures show an upward trend, while fall and spring temperatures
    show a downward trend. Higher temperatures in the early part of both farming seasons
    (initial growth period of crops) may be beneficial, but detrimental as it gets
    hotter in the later stages.
  7: Soil types acrisols and arenosols may enhance crop net revenues and reduce the
    negative effect of climate change, while xerosols may reduce crop net revenues
    and aggravate the negative effect. Runoff will increase net revenues and also
    reduce the negative effects of climate, especially for dryland farming.
  8: The impacts of climate change vary significantly by farming season, agro-ecological
    zone, and province. The timing of rainfall is crucial for policy and farmer planning.
  10: Net revenue impacts show significant variability depending on whether a farm
    is irrigated or dryland, with nonlinear relationships observed beyond certain
    climate thresholds.
  11: The effects of climate change vary across different seasons, farming systems,
    and agro-ecological and provincial levels. There are likely to be winners and
    losers.
  12: The coefficients are presented in a table format, which can be hard to interpret
    without the full context of the paper.
