Drivers of Risk:
  2: Rising temperatures
  3: Temperature, agricultural potential, interaction between temperature and agricultural
    potential
  4: Annual variation in temperature, Agricultural Potential
  11: Temperature, Interaction (likely interaction of temperature with another unspecified
    variable)
  12: Average temperature (1946-2014, country level) and agricultural potential (share
    of land with SI>40)
  15: Temperature changes are the primary driver of risk examined.
Highlights:
  2: "Initial agricultural conditions play a signi\uFB01cant role to understand the\
    \ climate-con\uFB02ict linkages on a global scale."
  3: Study aims to establish the causal link between temperature and conflicts through
    the magnifying effects of agricultural potential.
  4: Countries with low agricultural potential have a larger probability than high
    agricultural potential countries to be in conflict in response to a deviation
    from their mean annual temperature.
  11: Temperature and its interaction with another variable (unspecified) have statistically
    significant effects. The sign and magnitude of the coefficients on temperature
    and its interaction vary depending on the specification (e.g., using raw temperature,
    standardized temperature, or decadal averages).
  12: There is an interaction between temperature, agricultural potential, and conflict
    incidence, with conflict more likely in zones where these variables intersect,
    particularly at average temperatures of around 6 and 16 degrees.
Methodology:
  2: "Uses data for 172 countries from 1946 until 2014 and conducts a natural experiment\
    \ to identify the e\uFB00ect of the interaction between time-wise variations in\
    \ temperature within a country and the cross-country variation in agricultural\
    \ potential on con\uFB02ict incidence."
  3: Linear probability model examining the effect of the interaction between temperature
    and agricultural potential on conflict incidence; Uses country and year fixed
    effects to control for unobserved variables; Considered akin to a natural experiment.
  4: The study uses a difference-in-differences approach where agricultural potential
    determines the group for countries with a lower agricultural potential and the
    annual variation in temperature act as a treatment from one period to the next.
  11: Linear probability model with country and time fixed effects, robust standard
    errors clustered at the country level; sample sizes are either 9344 or 990 observations.
    Results are based on temperature, interaction term, standardized temperature,
    or decennial temperature averages.
  12: The analysis uses a contour plot/heatmap to illustrate the relationship between
    average temperature, agricultural potential, and predicted conflict incidence.
  15: Linear probability model with country and time fixed effects, using temperature
    as a key independent variable. Robust standard errors are clustered at the country
    level. Models include a constant. Analysis is performed on 9344 observations except
    for Decade (990 obs.).
More Notes:
  2: "The interaction between temperature and agricultural potential has no signi\uFB01\
    cant e\uFB00ect in countries with exportable resources such as oil."
  3: The paper argues that the interaction between climate fluctuations and geographic
    characteristics is free from human intervention and thus the interaction variable
    (temperature*agricultural_potential) can be considered exogenous. Countries exhibiting
    high agricultural potential act as a control group.
  4: The paper focuses on intrastate conflicts with a clearly defined political incompatibility.
  11: Agricultural potential is captured by country fixed effects. The nature of the
    outcome variable being modeled is not specified, only that it is analyzed using
    a linear probability model. The interaction variable is not identified.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: No relevant information
  3: Intergroup violence/conflict incidence
  4: No relevant information
  11: No relevant information
  12: Predicted conflict incidence
  15: Not specified, but the linear probability model suggests a binary or categorical
    outcome related to economic impacts of climate change. The page focuses on the
    *probability* of something occurring, not the magnitude of the change in a specific
    macroeconomic variable.
Quantitative material:
  2: "There is a signi\uFB01cantly higher probability (4%) to be in con\uFB02ict when\
    \ annual temperature deviates from its mean in a country with low agricultural\
    \ potential relative to a country with high agricultural potential."
  4: A change of one degree Celsius is associated with an increase in the probability
    of being in conflict by 4.1% relatively to better endowed countries.
  11: Yes, coefficients from a linear probability model are provided. For example,
    the coefficient on 'Temp' is 0.0175361 in one specification and 0.0410341 in another;
    the coefficient on the 'Interaction' term ranges from -0.1404783 to 0.0391829.
  12: The plot shows conflict incidence peaking around an average temperature of 6
    degrees with agricultural potential of 0.5, and also at a higher temperature of
    around 16 degrees.
