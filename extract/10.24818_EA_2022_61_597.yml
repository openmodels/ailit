Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate risk (as measured by a climate risk index).
  3: Climate change, disorganized transition to a low-carbon economy, climate shocks,
    greenhouse gas emissions, transition risk, physical risk
  4: Natural disasters and climate risks impacting market evolution, companies' profits
    and creditworthiness, and leading to an increase in non-performing debts.
  6: Climate risks/Climate change.
  7: Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), Political Stability Index (PSI), Financial
    Freedom Index (FFI), Inflation rate (INF), Unemployment rate (UNE).
  8: Extreme weather events (storms, floods, and heat waves) as captured by the Climate
    Risk Index (CRI).
  10: Macroeconomic factors such as economic growth, inflation rate, control of corruption,
    political stability, and financial freedom influence sovereign CDS and competitiveness.
  11: Climate Risk Index (CRI), GDP per capita (GDPc), Inflation (INF), Unemployment
    (UNE), Consumer Price Index (CPI), Political Stability Index (PSI), Financial
    Freedom Index (FFI)
  12: Increasing climate risk is the main driver of the negative impact on market
    capitalization.
  13: Climate risk is identified as a driver impacting competitiveness and sovereign
    risk, particularly in countries with low budget deficits or low country risk.
  14: Climate change, Climate policy, Stranded assets, Climate shocks, Temperature
    shifts, Transition risk
  15: Climate shocks, climate policy risk, ESG rating disagreement
  16: Climate change, global temperature shocks, carbon risk, climate vulnerability
  17: Natural disasters, political conflicts, climate regulation, catastrophic events,
    climate change, climate policy
Highlights:
  2: Climate risks negatively impact stock market capitalization; climate risks increase
    sovereign risk when CDS levels are small; climate risks have a small influence
    on global competitiveness.
  3: Climate change poses significant risks to macroeconomic variables and public
    finances, requiring substantial investment in sustainable projects. Climate shocks
    could impact the cost of equity by up to 2.80% yearly, equivalent to a global
    GDP loss of 2.2 trillion USD; the cost of climate risks (for transition and physical)
    in the UK by 2100 is estimated to be between 16 and 32 billion GBP. Banks will
    play a crucial role in the transition of highly polluting countries to low carbon.
  4: Climate risks affect the macroeconomic environment including market evolution,
    company profitability, and financial stability.
  6: Climate risk significantly impacts economic and financial variables, warranting
    attention from policymakers and investors. Climate change has led to an increase
    in the cost of public debt.
  8: The Climate Risk Index (CRI) is stationary, allowing for inclusion in regressions
    without spurious results. Multicollinearity is not a significant problem.
  11: Climate risk (CRI) has a statistically significant, positive relationship with
    sovereign CDS spreads when sovereign risk is low (q10). Climate risk (CRI) has
    a statistically significant, negative relationship with market capitalization
    as a percentage of GDP at quantiles q25, q50, and q75.
  12: Increasing climate risk negatively impacts stock market capitalization, particularly
    for countries with medium market capitalization (not very low or very high). The
    impact on competitiveness is modeled using a binary LOGIT approach.
  13: Climate risk negatively impacts global competitiveness, but the result is statistically
    insignificant; limited impact found in countries with low or high market capitalization.
  14: The study confirms the need to involve all economic and political decision makers,
    as well as financial regulators, in the adoption of specific measures to reduce
    the financial and macroeconomic risks caused by climate change.
  15: Climate change and related policies have tangible impacts on various financial
    assets and macroeconomic indicators.
  16: Climate change impacts cost of debt, macroeconomic stability, firm performance,
    and financial stability.
  17: Climate risk impacts banking stability, financial stability, sovereign risk,
    and competitiveness.
Methodology:
  2: Panel data approach using quantile and logistic regression on a sample of 22
    countries (16 EU, 6 OECD) during 2008-2019.
  3: APT model (for cost of equity); empirical study on the US capital market (for
    economic growth and well-being); analysis of capital structure at the company
    level (for leverage effect); study on the UK market (for cost of climate risks)
  4: Panel data approach with fixed and variable effects, VAR Structural Panel model,
    and linear methodologies specific to panel data.
  6: Quantiles regression and LOGIT regression. Analysis based on a sample of 263
    observations across different countries, focusing on countries with available
    data on a 'climate risk index'. Considers other economic and financial variables
    alongside climate risk to explain dynamics of market capitalization, sovereign
    risk, and competitiveness.
  7: Panel Data Approach to assess the impact of climate risk on the economy.
  8: Panel data analysis using stationary variables, including the Climate Risk Index
    (CRI). Unit root tests (Levin, Lin, and Chu) are used to ensure stationarity.
    Correlation matrix and Variance Influence Factor (VIF) are used to assess multicollinearity.
  10: The analysis uses a LOGIT model to identify determinants of competitiveness
    and the influence of climate risk, and a quantile regression with sovereign CDS
    as a dependent variable.
  11: Panel data quantile regression. Results are applicable for countries with varying
    levels of sovereign risk and market capitalization. The impact of climate risk
    on sovereign risk is better identified in countries with a very high degree of
    economic and financial complexity and increased political stability.
  12: Quantile regression is used to assess the impact of climate risk on market capitalization.
    A LOGIT model is used to assess the impact of climate risk on competitiveness.
  13: The analysis uses quantile regressions and logistic regression; data limitations
    noted in countries with high sovereign risk.
  14: Empirical analysis using e-journals, working papers, and online resources.
  15: Panel data approach; Survey; Working papers
  16: Cross-country analysis, CAPM with rare disasters, quantile regression, panel
    data analysis are used; methodologies vary across papers, applicability depends
    on specific methodology and assumptions.
  17: Panel data approach, time series evidence, network analysis

Quantitative material:
  2: Negative relationship between climate risks and stock market capitalization as
    a percentage of GDP; climate risk leads to an increase in sovereign risk only
    across inferior quantiles; the level of competitiveness of a country is influenced
    to a small extent by the level of climate risk.
  3: Climate shocks could impact the cost of equity by up to 2.80% yearly, equivalent
    to a global GDP loss of 2.2 trillion USD; the cost of climate risks (for transition
    and physical) in the UK by 2100 is estimated to be between 16 and 32 billion GBP.
  6: 1% increase in climate risk can lead to a 3% increase in long-term government
    bond rates in developing countries; Climate change increased the cost of public
    debt by more than 1.17% between 1996 and 2016; Climate change could lead to economic
    losses of between 2% and 21% of global economic output by the end of the century.
  7: Uses panel data from 22 EU and OECD countries from 2008 to 2019.
  8: The Climate Risk Index (CRI) is used as an explanatory variable, with data reflecting
    direct economic losses as a share of GDP and the number of deaths. Unit root tests
    show the CRI is stationary at both level (-5.5757, p=0.0000) and first difference
