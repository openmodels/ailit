Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climatic uncertainty and declining global wild fish stock.
  2: Overfishing, pollution in the Arabian Gulf, uncertain climatic conditions, massive
    urbanization invading coastal areas, unsustainable fishing practices, and market
    competition from imported fish.
  6: Technological change in the UAE fisheries sector, specifically a shift from capital
    and labor to natural resources due to sustainable fishery practices (artificial
    habitats, conservation zones, information databases).
  8: Adoption of sustainable fishing practices that enhance the natural fishery resource
    endowment.
  9: Technological changes suggested from research enhance the economic situation
    of both consumers and producers of fish in the UAE through sustainable practices.
  10: Climate change, specifically focusing on adaptation strategies in the fisheries
    sector.
  11: Fluctuations in fish catch quantity and value (2006-2012) affect self-sufficiency.
  12: The scenarios are implicitly driven by climate change, though the page does
    not explicitly mention this.
Highlights:
  1: Prices of fishery products and of other related commodities will decline which
    will benefit the consumers the most. Producers in all relevant directly and indirectly
    related economic sectors gain due to more sales, which offsets economic losses
    caused by the lower fish prices. Returns to factors of production, such capital,
    and labor, also change from sustainable practices.
  2: The fisheries industry in the UAE is facing extreme challenges as the fish catch
    is significantly declining and is unsustainable.
  8: Sustainable fishing practices reduce fish prices but increase the value-added
    of other related economic sectors, leading to increased output of the UAE food
    sector. Sustainable fishing practices spill out and benefit consumers by lowering
    prices of fish and fish substitutes such as other meat products.
  9: Technological changes (sustainable practices) in the fisheries sector enhance
    the economic situation of both consumers and producers of fish in the UAE. Consumers
    can consume more fish and pay lower prices. Fish exports increase while fish imports
    decrease.
  10: Adaptation strategies in the UAE fisheries sector can lead to increased fish
    production and household consumption, potentially at lower prices for consumers.
    Government intervention may be needed to ensure adequate investment in long-term
    climate change adaptation due to the potential for underinvestment by fishermen.
  11: Fish self-sufficiency in the UAE has declined from around 100% in the early
    1980s to approximately 40% by 2012. Fish catch quantity and value fluctuated between
    2006 and 2012.
  12: Significant changes in the fishing industry, with a large decrease in import
    value (-6.64% to -11.75%) and a large increase in export value (13.48% to 25.77%).
    Raw milk, red meat, meat products, dairy products, processed rice, sugar, food
    products and vegetable oils and fats also have impacts.
Methodology:
  1: Empirical UAE economic data and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model used
    to perform the analysis, assuming targeted shifts based on adaptation measures
    scenarios.
  6: Uses a global Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model based on the GTAP database
    Version 9 (base year 2011), with 140 regions aggregated into the UAE and the rest
    of the world (ROW), and 57 sectors. It models full employment, perfect competition,
    and factor mobility assumptions (capital and labor mobile, land and natural resources
    immobile).
  8: CGE (Computable General Equilibrium) model used to simulate the impact of sustainable
    fishing practices in the UAE. The results are applicable to the UAE economy.
  9: The research uses a model to simulate the economic impacts of technological changes
    (sustainable practices) in the UAE fisheries sector under two scenarios. The scenarios
    consider direct and induced economic impacts, captured by forward and backward
    linkages.
  10: Economic modeling exercise considering scenarios of increased capital endowment
    for the fisheries sector (15% and 30% increase from 2012 baseline), with additional
    labor increases in one scenario. The GTAP model is mentioned in the references
    implying it might have been used.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the fisheries sector in the UAE and evaluates the economic
    impacts of sustainable practices (hard and soft measures) in the face of climate
    change.
  8: The analysis focuses on the fisheries sub-sector and its impact on other food
    sectors in the UAE.
  9: The base year for the data is 2012. The value of fish exports in 2012 was very
    small ($31,000), while the base value of fish imports was $47.5 million.
  10: The study acknowledges limitations related to static conditions and the need
    for a long-term perspective considering capital accumulation and investment impacts.
    Sustainable practices could include both physical (dikes, harbors) and soft measures
    (early warning systems, enforcement of regulations).
  11: The data suggests a decline in the UAEs ability to meet its fish demand from
    domestic sources over the long-term period.
  12: The two scenarios are not defined on this page. "nec" means "not elsewhere considered".
No relevant information:
  7: This page focuses on the supply elasticity of the fisheries sector in the UAE
    and does not directly address nation-wide macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes
    related to climate change adaptation. The focus is on production quantities within
    the fisheries sector.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Changes in consumer and producer welfare in the UAE due to simulated targeted
    interventions related to fisheries sustainability.
  2: GDP per capita reached US$ 59,845 in 2009 (PPP). Value of fish in 2012 is about
    1.2 million AED, compared to 0.9 million AED in 2006. Total value of fish catch
    in the UAE increased from less than $20 million (early 1950s) to more than $120
    million (early 2000s), then declined to less than $100 million (late 2000s).
  8: Changes in prices of fish, red meat, dairy products, and other food products;
    changes in real prices of production factors (land, unskilled labor, skilled labor,
    capital, natural resources); changes in commodity output of selected industries.
  9: Changes in merchandise trade (exports and imports), household demand for commodities,
    prices paid by firms to production factors, and private consumption prices of
    selected commodities.
  10: Increase in fish production, changes in prices of production factors, changes
    in household consumption of domestically-produced fish.
  11: Fish self-sufficiency ratio in the UAE is tracked from 1982-2012.
  12: Changes in the value of merchandise imports (CIF) and exports (FOB).
Quantitative material:

  2: Fish catch declined from 100,000 tons in 2006 to about 73,000 tons in 2012 (a
    27% decline). Fish self-sufficiency ratio was estimated to be 91%, 128%, and 38%
    in 1982, 1991, and 2012, respectively. UAE gross domestic product (GDP) per capita
    converted to international dollars using Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) values
    is reported to have reached US$ 59,845 in 2009. The value of fish in 2012 is about
    1.2 million AED, compared to 0.9 million AED in 2006. Total value of fish catch
    increased from less than $20 million (early 1950s) to more than $120 million (early
    2000s), then declined to less than $100 million (late 2000s).
