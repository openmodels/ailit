Drivers of Risk:
  3: Climate change impacts our food systems; short-term, periodic changes in climatic
    conditions; extreme and prolonged temperature anomalies affecting abundance, composition
    and geographical ranges of commercial species and damaging ecosystems like corals,
    kelps, and seagrasses.
  7: Fuel, Sea Surface Temperature (SST), and various types of fisheries (crustacean,
    large pelagic, marine, mixed pelagic, mollusc, diadromous) are included as drivers.
  10: Sea surface temperature warming, climate variability and weather extremes, increasing
    fuel index, competitive pricing of imported foods, number of industrial tuna vessels
    offloading fish, internally driven changes in market forces.
  11: Fuel price, sea surface temperature (SST), and the abundance of crustaceans,
    large pelagic fish, mixed pelagic fish, marine fishes, molluscs, and diadromous
    fishes.
  13: Economic cycles affecting fishing costs and demand; Ongoing global warming;
    Climate extreme events in the sea; Fluctuations in Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
    anomalies.
Highlights:
  3: Focuses on sea surface temperature anomalies as an indicator of climatic change
    and explores how they affect technical efficiencies of artisanal fleets globally.
  7: The table highlights the statistical significance of various drivers. For example,
    fuel, crustacean, and diadromous are highly significant (***), while SST and large_pelagic
    are significant (*). Several countries also have significant coefficients, indicating
    country-specific effects on the outcome.
  9: Many countries show statistically significant (**) or highly statistically significant
    (***) estimates, suggesting a noteworthy impact on the unspecified economic term.
    Several countries have negative estimates with high significance (e.g., Suriname,
    Tuvalu, Trinidad Tob), while others have positive estimates with high significance
    (e.g., Taiwan, USA, Vanuatu).
  10: North American/Europe region has benefited from SST and technical efficiency
    leading to increased fisheries since the 1990s when fuel costs were low.
  11: Fuel price has a positive coefficient and marine fish price has a negative coefficient
    regarding their effects on technical efficiency.
  13: Economic (prices, costs) and environmental (SST anomalies) factors significantly
    explain past changes in global artisanal fleets technical efficiency; These effects
    vary regionally (some regions increase efficiency with higher prices/SST, others
    decrease).
Methodology:
  1: Examined historical changes (1950-2014) in technical efficiency within the global
    artisanal fishing fleets in relation to sea surface temperature anomalies, market
    prices by taxonomic group, and fuel costs.
  3: Uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to estimate technical efficiency of artisanal
    fleets, combining it with market dynamics and sea surface temperature anomalies
    in a second-stage statistical approach. Bootstrapping is used to improve statistical
    validity of the DEA scores. The DEA analysis is conducted at the exclusive economic
    zones (EEZs) level.
  7: The analysis uses Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and bootstrapped OLS
    (bias-corrected) to estimate the relationship between the drivers and the outcome
    variable. Significance levels are indicated by asterisks (*, **, ***).
  10: The analysis uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models to estimate the differences
    between weather events affecting capacity utilization and technical efficiency,
    potentially leading to an unbiased estimate of capacity utilization using the
    ratio of the two models.
  11: The paper calculates country-specific elasticities for various predictor variables
    using global maps. The marginal effect elasticities represent the impact of a
    1% change in each variable on technical efficiency.
  13: Examination of the global artisanal fleet to improve understanding of factors
    influencing fishing efficiency; analysis of economic and environmental factors
    affecting technical efficiency of fisheries. The approach involves teasing apart
    cause and effect parameters related to resource users, market dynamics, and climate
    change; results applicable to understanding past changes in global artisanal fleets'
    technical efficiency.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the artisanal fishing sector and its response to climate
    and economic changes.
  3: The paper aims to provide knowledge for fisheries enforcement under changing
    economics and environmental conditions by monitoring changes in technical efficiency
    influenced by climatic, cost, and price factors.
  7: The table presents only a portion of the regression results, likely from Model
    1. The outcome variable, data source, and full model specification are needed
    for complete interpretation.  The country variables appear to be indicator variables
    representing the impact of being in a particular country.
  8: The asterisks (e.g., *, **, ***) likely indicate statistical significance levels,
    but the exact meaning of each level is not defined on this page. The table is
    continued from a previous page.
  9: Without the context of the full paper, the precise interpretation of the 'term',
    the units of measurement, and the specific adaptation measures being evaluated
    are unclear.  The table provides point estimates and confidence intervals, but
    understanding the underlying model and assumptions is crucial for proper interpretation.
  10: Artisanal vessels may be forced to alter their production strategies due to
    market forces, potentially leading to social and economic consequences for coastal
    communities. Climate induced changes may affect allocation of catches between
    country EEZs.
  11: The analysis indicates that government subsidies, particularly fuel subsidies
    for fishing fleets (e.g., the Chinese fleet), contribute to excess capacity.
  13: The paper focuses on technical efficiency of fisheries, going beyond just catches
    and profits.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Impacts are already leading to sudden declines, long-term collapses in production,
    or increases in the price of fish products, which can further exacerbate excess
    levels of fishing capacity.
  3: Altered fishing patterns, price collapses, and closures of fisheries, which can
    have significant socio-economic implications.
  7: The table presents coefficients from a regression model. While the specific outcome
    variable is not explicitly stated on this page, the table contains regression
    estimates related to various 'fuel' and 'SST' (Sea Surface Temperature), and fisheries-related
    variables (crustacean, large_pelagic, marine, mixed_pelagic, mollusc, diadromous),
    along with country-specific effects. It's possible the outcome is related to economic
    activity or a measure of fisheries productivity, given the drivers considered.
  8: The table presents estimates related to an unspecified term/outcome for various
    countries; the table includes estimates, bias, standard error, bias-corrected
    estimates (bc), lower confidence limits (lcl) and upper confidence limits (ucl).
  9: The table presents estimates related to some kind of economic term (unspecified)
    for a range of countries.

    Le Manach, 2015). Therefore, the overall impact of a positive or negative 1% shock
    on this scale in China could have dramatic effects on their seafood production
