Drivers of Risk:
  1: Tropical cyclones
  2: TC maximum wind speed is the primary driver of risk considered in the exposure
    assessment.
  5: Tropical cyclones (TCs), climate variability (e.g., ENSO), potential underreporting
    of TCs in earlier periods.
  6: Tropical cyclones (TCs) of varying wind speeds (34, 64, and 96 knots) are the
    primary drivers of risk, with exposure levels differing based on the intensity
    and frequency of these events. The study considers both historical and projected
    population and asset patterns, indicating that demographic and economic development
    trends also influence exposure.
  7: Tropical cyclone exposure, with wind speeds above specified thresholds, impacting
    population and assets.
  8: Tropical cyclone (TC) properties and wind speed thresholds (34 kn, 64 kn, 96
    kn) are drivers of risk.
  9: Tropical cyclones (exposure data sets).
Highlights:
  1: The dataset (TCE-DAT) covers the period 1950 to 2015 and is freely available.
  2: The paper introduces the TCE-DAT, a globally consistent dataset of TC exposure
    from 1950 to 2015, providing estimates of exposed population and assets by individual
    landfalling TCs.
  5: TC reporting in IBTrACS has improved significantly since 1980, reaching comprehensive
    global coverage.
  6: The study highlights that the 34 knots wind speed threshold consistently shows
    the highest economic exposure, and 96 knots the least, suggesting that more frequent,
    less intense storms can cause significant aggregate damage due to their wider
    reach.
  7: A new and comprehensive data set TCE-DAT for global historical TC exposure between
    1950 and 2015 is provided.
  8: This work provides a valuable additional resource to the community studying TC-related
    impacts, in particular for non-experts in this field. The TC exposure database
    is based on physical storm properties.
  9: Creation of a global historical dataset of tropical cyclone exposure data sets
    (TCE-DAT) and associated GDP data.
Methodology:
  1: A simplified wind field model is applied to estimate areas exposed to wind speeds
    above 34, 64, and 96 knots. Spatially explicit data on population densities and
    GDP are used to estimate the number of people and the sum of assets exposed to
    wind speeds above these thresholds.
  2: The paper uses the CLIMADA model to estimate exposure to TCs based on wind fields
    and socioeconomic data. It defines risk as a function of hazard, exposure, and
    vulnerability. Exposure is quantified as the number of potentially affected people
    and the sum of potentially affected assets. A step-like vulnerability function
    is used, assigning a value of zero below a certain wind speed threshold and one
    above.
  5: Uses IBTrACS archive and Holland08 wind field model to generate wind fields and
    analyze TC activity. TCE-DAT provides wind speed information and exposed population
    and assets at the grid level.
  6: The study uses the TCE-DAT model to estimate TC exposure based on historical
    TC tracks and socioeconomic data. They validate the model using the HURDAText
    archive for the United States, comparing model estimates with observational records
    of storm size and wind speed at landfall.
  7: Overlays estimated wind fields with gridded information about population and
    assets to assess exposure.
  8: The TCE-DAT database was created using only freely available input data and established
    methods, and the freely available modeling tool CLIMADA with module ISIMIP. The
    analysis involves comparing exposed population data estimated using the Holland08
    wind field model and the observed HURDAText database at different wind speed thresholds.
  9: Data collection and harmonization of GDP data with climate and socioeconomic
    pathways.
More Notes:
  1: The paper aims to provide data to assess the contribution of climatological versus
    socioeconomic drivers of changes in exposure to tropical cyclones, estimate changes
    in vulnerability, and build improved exposure-based predictors to estimate societal
    impacts.
  2: The paper focuses on physical exposure and does not directly quantify damages
    or economic impacts. TCE-DAT complements other datasets like EM-DAT and NATCAT
    by providing exposure estimates that can be combined with damage data to assess
    historical vulnerabilities.
  5: The analysis is limited by the accuracy of the wind field model and potential
    underreporting of TCs before 1980. The analysis only considers wind fields and
    maximum sustained wind speed.
  6: The study acknowledges uncertainties in socioeconomic data, particularly in the
    distribution of GDP, and the use of 2016 national assets/GDP ratios to approximate
    asset structure for all years between 1950 and 2015, which might overestimate
    asset values for fast-developing countries in earlier years.
  7: The Holland08 wind field model has some limitations, but exposure estimates for
    other parts of the world and other time periods can be used to approximate exposure
    given the lack of observed wind fields.
  8: The paper aims to avoid present endogeneity issues relevant for econometric assessments
    of TC impacts by creating the TC exposure database. The database only uses data
    of exposed population and assets, i.e., relying only on TC properties, which are
    not available elsewhere.
  9: The TCE-DAT data collection is available via GFZ Data Services.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Long-term effects on GDP
  2: The paper does not directly address macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. It focuses
    on estimating the population and assets exposed to tropical cyclones (TCs).
  5: Mentions TC risk analysis, suggesting potential for examining economic costs
    associated with TCs.
  6: The study indirectly relates TC exposure to economic impacts by calculating exposed
    assets in trillion 2005 U.S. dollars (purchasing power parity), which can be interpreted
    as potential economic losses from TC damage.
  7: Exposed population and exposed assets by event and country for tropical cyclones
    with wind speeds above 34, 64, and 96 knots.
  8: Long-run economic consequences of natural disasters in general are of interest.
