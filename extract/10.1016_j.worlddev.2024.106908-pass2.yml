  29: "Heightened preparedness for climate change adaptation (as measured by the readiness\
    \ indicator of the ND-Gain), vulnerability to climate change, inflation, World\
    \ Bank\u2019s Rule of Law estimate, higher terms of trade, greater economic complexity."
  30: Inflation, debt-to-GDP ratio

    with policies aimed at fostering a climate-resilient and sustainable economy.
  32: Climate change vulnerability (positive influence) and climate change readiness
    (negative influence, offsetting vulnerability)
  33: Climate risk is driven by vulnerability to climate change, which impacts countries
    with riskier profiles for short-term maturities and low-risk countries at longer
    maturities.

  37: The role of natural disasters in determining yield spreads is emphasized as
    an upcoming topic.
  38: Natural disasters are introduced as a determinant of sovereign risk.
  39: Natural disasters, measured in different ways (economic loss as a percentage
    of GDP, number of deaths, number of people affected), are the primary drivers
    of risk. Geophysical and weather-related disasters are considered separately.

    are identified as drivers that could exacerbate sovereign risk.
  50: Natural disasters, climate change, macroeconomic factors
  54: Implied. The values of sovereign debt spreads are given with respect to the
    US government bond yield, so changes in investor behavior are a relevant driver.
Highlights:
  5: Sovereign risk exhibits asymmetric reactions to its determinants across the conditional
    distribution of credit spreads; Investing in climate change preparedness proves
    effective in mitigating vulnerability to climate change, in terms of sovereign
    risk, particularly for countries with low spreads and long-term debt; For countries
    with high spreads and short-term debt, climate change readiness alone is insufficient
    to offset vulnerability effects; The actual occurrence of natural disasters is
    less influential than vulnerability to climate change in determining spreads.
  6: Climate change vulnerability significantly impacts shorter debt maturities, especially
    for high-risk countries with elevated borrowing costs; International efforts should
    recognize the distinct impact of climate change on interest payments for debt.
  7: The study considers a nonlinear relationship between explanatory factors and
    sovereign spreads, governed by the level of the spread itself. Determinants of
    spreads hold more relevance for different segments of the spread distribution,
    while others are virtually unimportant at specific quantiles.
  10: Climate change vulnerability has a more significant effect on short-term borrowing
    costs for high-risk countries; long-term maturities are more affected in low-risk
    countries.
  11: Climate change has a highly asymmetric impact on emerging and low-income developing
    countries compared to developed countries. Spreads predominantly react to vulnerability
    and readiness to climate change as a general concept, rather than the actual occurrence
    of natural disasters.
  15: RF is chosen over linear factor models (like Tall-Wide estimator or latent factor
    model) because it can preserve the nonlinear features of data relationships. The
    inclusion of categorical and continuous variables in our dataset advocates for
    the use of RF over the factor-based alternatives.
  17: The model analyzes the relationship between various indicators (including climate
    change vulnerability and readiness) and sovereign risk, measured by yield spreads.
  19: Panel quantile models are essential for estimating the direct effects of economic
    and climate-related determinants on spreads. The inclusion of the factor structure
    is driven by the need to tailor the methodology from a statistical medicine context
    to an international macroeconomic setting.
  23: Countries experiencing natural disasters may be more susceptible to climate
    risk vulnerabilities and may be incentivized to enhance preparedness; Sovereign
    spreads are used as a measure of risk.
  27: The dynamics between the spread series are effectively preserved throughout
    the imputation process. Correlations between spreads at 5 and 10 years exhibit
    a slight reduction after imputation, while correlations between short-term maturity
    spreads at 1 and 2 years tend to slightly increase.
  28: Higher debt-to-GDP ratio, inflation, and increased vulnerability to climate
    change contribute to higher sovereign yield spreads. Improved institutions contribute
    to lower spreads.
  29: Heightened preparedness for climate change adaptation contributes to lower spreads
    across all maturities; vulnerability to climate change and inflation have substantial
    positive effects on sovereign risk; common market trends must be accounted for.
  30: The impact of inflation on sovereign risk is asymmetric across different quantiles
    of spreads, with a more pronounced effect when sovereign risk is already high.
  31: There is a positive relationship between vulnerability and sovereign risk, comparable
    in magnitude to the effect of inflation.
  32: Climate change vulnerability positively influences sovereign borrowing costs,
    but this can be offset by proportionate increases in climate change preparedness.
    The effect of vulnerability is most pronounced at the 90th quantile of the 2-year
    spread.
  33: Market places a high price on climate risk for short-term maturities; climate
    change vulnerability is a rollover risk for high-risk countries and a long-term
    solvency risk for advanced economies.
  34: The effects of climate change risks vary across the quantiles of the spreads
    distribution, which is particularly important for emerging and low-income countries.
  35: Economic complexity is a reliable predictor of future fiscal crises and lower
    borrowing costs. The impact of economic complexity tends to be more pronounced
    for higher quantiles (except for very short 1-year maturity). Annual real growth
    rate is consistently significant across all maturities and quantiles.
  37: Institutional quality, measured by the Rule of Law, negatively affects yield
    spreads, particularly for long maturities and at lower quantiles. There is significant
    differentiation in yield spreads based on idiosyncratic components.
  38: Natural disasters diminish governments' capacity to borrow from abroad and depress
    overall welfare, constraining governments' access to financial markets and increasing
    sovereign spreads.
  39: The correlation within categories of disaster measurement is high, but the correlation
    between different ways of measuring the effects of disasters is low.
  40: Incorporating natural disasters into the model improves the statistical significance
    of several variables, particularly for 5-year maturities (not on this page). Rule
    of Law becomes significant on five occasions. The debt-to-GDP ratio loses significance
    in two specifications. Overall, the model adjustment appears to improve with the
    incorporation of natural disasters, with no changes in the magnitudes or signs
    of the effects provided in Table 3 and discussed earlier.
  41: Natural disasters are generally insignificant across quantiles and maturities.
    Variables achieving significance in the updated model specification (incorporating
    natural disasters) are highlighted in green, while those that lose significance
    are highlighted in red, compared to models without natural disasters.
  42: Natural disasters in category 3 are frequently significant and positive as a
    GDP loss.
  43: Increments in disasters in the third category lead to higher spreads in six
    cases. Surprisingly, when disasters (measured by deaths and population affected)
    are significant, they tend to *reduce* spreads, with negative effects on spreads
    occurring frequently in category 1 (people exposed) and category 2 (deaths). However,
    there is one exception with a positive impact on 2-year spreads for the second
    cluster of countries, second disaster category, and 90th percentile.
  44: Sovereign spreads respond differently to economic determinants depending on
    whether the spreads are very high or very low. Climate change poses an asymmetric
    risk to emerging and low-income developing countries. Spreads predominantly react
    to vulnerability and readiness to climate change as a general concept, rather
    than the actual occurrence of natural disasters.
  45: The effect of natural disasters on sovereign risk is very small or insignificant
    once one controls for traditional determinants of sovereign risk; Readiness to
    climate change is most effective at reducing sovereign risk at long-term maturities;
    For countries with high spreads relying on short-term debt, increments in readiness
    tend to be smaller than the effects of vulnerability
  46: Natural disasters may cause an upward shift in spread distribution, increasing
    sovereign risk across maturities and spread levels.
  50: Climate change and natural disasters impact sovereign risk. Several papers explore
    determinants of sovereign yield spreads and bond yields.
  54: Shows the central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation,
    min/max) of various macroeconomic and fiscal variables across the sample. The
    large standard deviation for real GDP per capita suggests substantial variation
    across the countries included in the analysis.
Methodology:
  1: Working paper; likely an econometric or modeling approach given the focus on
    sovereign risk and climate change preparation.
  5: Panel-quantile regressions
  6: Novel and comprehensive empirical framework to evaluate the effects of macroeconomic,
    institutional, external sector, fiscal factors, natural disasters and climate
    change-related fundamentals across the entire conditional spread distribution;
    analysis of debt dynamics as inherently nonlinear.
  7: Employs panel quantile models to examine the relationship between explanatory
    factors and sovereign spreads, considering the level of the spread itself. The
    analysis distinguishes between emerging and low-income economies and advanced
    economies. The results are applicable to analyzing sovereign risk in emerging
    and low-income countries under a global ecological transition.
  10: Analysis includes 68 countries and explores determinants of sovereign spreads,
    employing quantile regression to assess impacts at different spread quantiles.
  11: Models incorporate the occurrence of natural disasters into the determination
    of sovereign spreads. Analysis considers asymmetric responses across the spread
    distribution to various determinants.
  12: Factor-augmented panel quantile regression, Random Forest machine learning algorithm
    for imputation
  13: The paper develops a model for imputing sovereign yield data, particularly focusing
    on addressing missing data points across countries and maturities. It uses maximum
    likelihood estimation with mixture distributions and incorporates a time-varying
    market factor derived from yield spreads using principal component analysis (PCA).
  14: Selects 66 variables to describe spread dynamics, including dummy variables
    for fiscal rules, crises, and quality of fiscal rules, as well as continuous variables
    like real GDP growth rate.
  15: Uses Random Forest (RF) to complete missing values in a dataset by treating
    missing values as the target variable. Aims to predict sovereign yield spreads
    using a range of macroeconomic, fiscal, and institutional variables.
  17: Quantile regression for longitudinal data (panel data models), both distribution-free
    (fixed effects) and likelihood-based methods are considered. Distribution free
    methods treat individual-specific intercepts as location shift parameters common
    to all conditional quantiles. Likelihood framework treats individual-specific
    parameters as independent and identically distributed random variables.
  18: The paper uses a linear quantile mixed model (LQMM) to analyze the data. The
    model incorporates random effects to account for unobserved heterogeneity between
    individuals/countries and dependence between repeated measurements over time.
    The model uses an Asymmetric Laplace Density (ALD) and estimates the mixing distribution
    non-parametrically using Non-Parametric Maximum Likelihood (NPML).
  19: Panel quantile models, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to estimate time-varying
    common factors, likelihood estimation, includes factor structure for modelling
    unobserved heterogeneity.
  23: Empirical model incorporating macroeconomic, fiscal, and institutional covariates;
    Includes binary variables for natural disasters to assess climate risk vulnerabilities.
  25: Random Forest (RF) imputation is used to fill in missing data for spreads.
  27: The analysis uses a panel quantile factor model to determine the impacts of
    the determinants of sovereign spreads across various maturities and quantiles
    of the spreads distribution. Missing data is imputed using a Random Forest (RF)
    method. Statistical significance is evaluated using a block-bootstrap procedure.
  28: Quantile regression analysis of sovereign yield spreads using scaled variables.
    Variables were scaled to have zero mean and unitary variance. The model examines
    the impact of determinants on sovereign yield spreads across different quantiles
    and maturities.
  29: Uses quantiles of spreads and examines the significance of variables across
    quantiles and maturities; incorporates a common factor using PCA to account for
    common market shocks.

  31: Examining vulnerability and preparedness in the context of climate change and
    its impact on sovereign risk.
  32: Quantile regression analysis examining the determinants of sovereign yield spreads
    with respect to the US at short maturities. Variables are scaled to have zero
    mean and unit variance for comparison.
  34: Quantile regression is used to analyze the determinants of sovereign yield spreads
    at different points in the distribution. All variables are scaled to have zero
    mean and unit variance.
  35: The study uses economic complexity as a predictor of future fiscal crises and
    analyzes its impact on borrowing costs across different maturities and quantiles.
    The role of real growth rate of economies on fiscal revenues is also examined.
  37: Panel quantile regression is used to model yield spreads. The approach is robust
    to outliers because it is based on order statistics. The impact of institutional
    quality (Rule of Law) is assessed.
  38: The idiosyncratic components of the model are modeled as a mixture of three
    distributions described by the location parameters presented in the table. EMDAT
    indicators are utilized, presenting high correlation within the same category
    (from 1 to 3) and low correlation between categories.
  39: The paper uses a model with a location equation to incorporate three disaster
    variables simultaneously. This approach captures the heterogeneous characteristics
    of disaster occurrences and considers their impact on yield distribution.
  40: The analysis uses a model that explicitly considers the occurrence of natural
    disasters in determining cross-country heterogeneity in sovereign debt markets,
    using quantile regressions.
  41: The analysis uses a regression model to assess the impact of various factors
    on sovereign yield spreads. The variables have been standardized to have zero
    mean and unit variance. The table reports modeling outcomes of country-idiosyncratic
    effects.
  42: Quantile regression is used to estimate the impact of natural disasters on some
    outcome. The analysis appears to consider different 'spread' periods (1, 2, and
    5 years) which may represent the time horizon over which the effect is measured.
  43: The idiosyncratic components of the model are modeled as a mixture of three
    distributions, and analysis includes natural disaster variables for three country
    clusters. The table displays the results of these components and variables on
    the spread. The time frame is 'Spread 10 Years'.
  44: The paper models sovereign spreads, integrating natural disasters and other
    macroeconomic, institutional, and fiscal variables. It analyzes asymmetric responses
    across the spread distribution to determinants.
  45: Econometric analysis controlling for macroeconomic, institutional, and fiscal
    variables; Analysis focuses on the effect of natural disasters, vulnerability,
    and readiness on sovereign risk
  50: Bayesian Approach, Linear Quantile Regression Models, Mixed Hidden Markov Quantile
    Regression Models
  55: Analysis based on a sample of countries. Countries and maturities with a larger
    amount of missing data were excluded from the analysis.
More Notes:
  1: The title suggests the paper explores asymmetric sovereign risk, implying that
    the impact of climate change on sovereign risk might be different depending on
    whether governments are preparing for it or not.
  5: The study focuses on the interaction between climate change vulnerability, preparedness,
    and sovereign risk, considering the role of a country's fiscal capacity.
  6: The impact of vulnerability, preparedness, and other determinants are not uniform
    across the spread distribution; adverse effects of climate change will disproportionately
    affect countries with initially higher spreads and reliance on mainly short-term
    debt.
  11: Economic losses from natural disasters increase spreads, while the number of
    people exposed to disasters reduces spreads, possibly due to international aid
    flows.
  13: The paper focuses on a statistical methodology for handling missing data in
    sovereign yield data and does not directly analyze the macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    risks of climate change, nor does it estimate the costs and benefits of adaptation.
    The methodology aims to avoid biases that may arise from neglecting a general
    market factor that affects all spreads.
  14: RF is used to impute missing data, addressing the issue of developed countries
    being overrepresented in high-quality datasets.
  15: The paper incorporates information on all available maturities (beyond 10 years).
  17: The ND-GAIN indicator, assessing a country's exposure to and socio-economic
    capacity to face climate change, is included as an explanatory variable.
  18: The model allows for the inclusion of natural disaster variables (see section
    4.3). The paper specifies time-fixed effects per country.
  21: The table summarizes the main variables used in the study, including their description,
    sources, and summary statistics. EMDAT, WEO-IMF, World Bank, ND-Gain Web Page,
    and Harvard Growth Lab Web Page are sources for the study's variables. Spreads
    are calculated using Bloomberg data.
  23: The analysis excludes 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic's influence
    on international debt markets; The inclusion of countries like Germany, Japan,
    and the UK, which sometimes have lower sovereign spreads than the US, influences
    the minimum spread.
  25: "The study uses the ND-GAIN index, which comprises readiness and vulnerability\
    \ components. A higher readiness value indicates better preparedness, while a\
    \ higher vulnerability value indicates a greater likelihood of climate events.\
    \ There is a positive correlation between the ND-GAIN and readiness index and\
    \ a country\u2019s level of development, while there is a negative correlation\
    \ between the vulnerability index and development."
  28: The variables used in the model align with a broad consensus in the literature
    and demonstrate the expected signs according to theoretical expectations.
  30: Increases in inflation can lead to immediate improvements in debt-to-GDP ratios,
    potentially mitigating the positive causal effect of inflation on sovereign yields.
  32: The study diverges from Beirne, Renzhi, and Volz (2021) by highlighting the
    importance of climate change readiness, whereas they emphasize vulnerability.
  34: The results offer a framework for understanding the mitigating effects of climate
    change preparation.
  37: The paper finds outliers in 2-year spreads at the 90th quantile. The institutional
    quality result is found to be a long-term structural determinant, particularly
    in market scenarios characterized by low volatility.
  38: The study claims to be the first to introduce natural disasters as a determinant
    of sovereign risk in a comprehensive sample of countries.
  39: The authors incorporate three disaster variables into the location equation
    to capture the heterogeneous characteristics of disaster occurrences and their
    impact on the yield distribution across quantiles and maturities.
  40: The page references Table 3, suggesting the model builds upon previous work.
    The model is applied to sovereign debt markets, suggesting a focus on government
    borrowing costs.
  41: The table shows the impact of determinants on sovereign yield spreads across
    all maturities ranging from 1 to 10 years and three quantiles of the spreads distribution
    (0.1, 0.5, and 0.9). All variables have been standardized to have zero mean and
    unit variance.
  42: The natural disasters are indexed numerically, for example, 'Natural D. 1.1',
    but there is no indication in the text what these codes represent.
  43: Spreads are higher in six cases due to increments in disasters in the third
    category. The table shows coefficients for different components and disasters
    on spreads, but it's not entirely clear what each component represents. The natural
    disaster variables are categorized into three clusters of countries, suggesting
    some regional differentiation in disaster impacts.
  44: The paper focuses on the immediate consequences of natural disasters on sovereign
    debt dynamics, unlike approaches that explore total effects inclusive of intermediate
    impacts stemming from the macroeconomic environment.
  50: This page lists titles and publication information, implying the papers investigate
    the listed concepts. NGFS report provides macro-financial stability implications
    of climate change, but this page is just bibliographic information about the paper.

  30: Impact of inflation on 1-year spreads falls from 0.27 to 0.17-0.18 when transitioning
    from the 90th quantile to the 50th and 10th quantiles. For the 2-year spread,
    this phenomenon is even more pronounced, decreasing from 0.21 to 0.12 to 0.08.
    For 10-year maturities, the effects diminish from 0.20 to 0.13 to 0.09 as we transition
    from the 90th quantile to the 50th and, finally, to the 10th quantile. The effect
    of the debt-to-GDP ratio, when significant, ranges between 8 and 11 percent (of
    one standard deviation in the debt-to-GDP ratio) for the median and the 90th quantile
    of the 2-year spread. The influence of the debt-to-GDP ratio on 10-year maturities,
    when significant, ranges between 6 and 8 percent of one standard deviation in
    spreads for the lower quantiles.
  31: Observes a distinct positive relationship between vulnerability and sovereign
    risk, comparable in magnitude to the effect of inflation (as measured by the scaled
    quantile slopes of the indicators); Association is particularly pronounced at
    the highest quantiles of spreads.
  32: Table 3 provides estimates, standard errors, z-values, and p-values for the
    impact of various factors (including vulnerability and readiness) on 1-year and
    2-year sovereign yield spreads at the 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 quantiles.
  34: The table shows estimates, standard errors, z-values, and p-values for the effect
    of the drivers of risk on sovereign yield spreads at 5-year and 10-year maturities,
    and at the 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 quantiles of the spread distribution.
  35: Effects of economic complexity on borrowing costs range between -0.24 and -0.07
    across various maturities and quantiles; Effects of annual real growth rate range
    between -5 and -10%.
  37: For 1-year spreads at the 0.9 quantile, results reveal three groups centered
    around spreads with means of zero, 0.36 standard deviations, and 1.17 standard
    deviations.
  38: Table 3 presents estimates, standard errors, z-values, and p-values for idiosyncratic
    components of a model related to sovereign spreads at different quantiles (0.9,
    0.5, 0.1) and for different time horizons (1 year, 2 years, 5 years, and 10 years).
  39: Correlation coefficients between different measures of natural disasters are
    provided (e.g., correlation between disasters measured as a percentage of economic
    loss to GDP and the number of deaths is 0.17). The correlation coefficients for
    various combinations of disaster metrics are reported in the table.
  40: Table 5 provides estimates, standard errors, z-values, and p-values for the
    impact of various factors on sovereign debt spreads at different quantiles (0.1,
    0.5, 0.9) and maturities (1 year, 2 years).
  41: The table provides coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics, and p-values
    for the impact of various determinants on sovereign yield spreads at different
    quantiles (0.1, 0.5, 0.9) and maturities (5 and 10 years).
  42: Table 6 presents estimates, standard errors, z-values, and p-values for 'Idiosyncratic
    Components Results Including Natural Disasters' for different quantiles (0.9,
    0.5, 0.1) and spread years (1, 2, and 5). The table includes specific estimates
    for 'Natural D. 1.1', 'Natural D. 1.2', 'Natural D. 1.3', 'Natural D. 2.1', 'Natural
    D. 2.2', 'Natural D. 2.3', 'Natural D. 3.1', 'Natural D. 3.2', and 'Natural D.
    3.3'.
  43: The table presents spreads (presumably percentage points) at different quantiles
    (0.9, 0.5, 0.1) for a 10-year spread horizon. It also provides coefficients associated
    with each component and natural disaster variable. Significant coefficients are
    bolded and shaded. The effects are generally small and below 4 percent in absolute
    terms, except for the notable exception for positive impacts on the 2-year spreads.
  44: The paper analyzes the 0.9 and 0.1 quantiles of the sovereign spread distribution
  45: Effects of natural disasters are relatively modest compared to those of vulnerability
    and readiness to climate change indicators; Readiness indicators are most effective
    in reducing sovereign risk at long-term maturities (5 and 10 years), but the impact
    diminishes at shorter maturities; Increase in readiness can potentially offset
    heightened vulnerability to climate change, particularly at the lower quantiles
    of the spread distribution; Increments in readiness tend to be smaller than the
    effects of vulnerability for countries with high spreads relying on short-term
    debt
  50: None explicitly stated in the provided text, though studies likely contain quantitative
    analysis.
  54: Provides summary statistics (Mean, Median, Std.Dev, Max, Min) for several macroeconomic
    and fiscal indicators, including debt spike, real GDP per capita, credit ratings
    (Fitch, Moody's, S&P), fiscal rule quality, and sovereign bond yield spreads.
  55: Figure shows the frequency of missing observations per country for 1, 2, 5,
    and 10 year maturities. The total number of years in the sample is 20.
