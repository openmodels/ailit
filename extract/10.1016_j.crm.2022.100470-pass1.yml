Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea level rise (SLR) due to climate change, specifically using sea level rise
    projections published in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (August 2021).
  2: Rising sea levels and an increase in the occurrence of extreme events leading
    to intensification of episodic flooding, permanent inundation of land, inundation
    of groundwater, and salinization of ground and surface waters. Also loss of biodiversity
    and ecosystem functions.
  4: Different greenhouse gas emission scenarios (SSPs) are driving projected sea
    level rise.
  5: Sea Level Rise (SLR) under different IPCC SSP scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6,
    SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5).
  6: Sea level rise (SLR) leading to land loss, particularly affecting areas within
    1 km of the coastline.
  7: Sea level rise (SLR) leading to potential land loss, wetland salinization, and
    soil salinization.
Highlights:
  1: Sea level rise threatens an area of 2840.64 km2 in Colombia under the worst-case
    scenario (SSP5-8.5) and will impact 12 departments or 86 municipalities with different
    social, environmental, economic, and cultural conditions.
  4: Sea level rise is projected to increase under higher emission scenarios (higher
    SSP numbers) for both Buenaventura and Cartagena.
  5: The Caribbean Sea coastline will experience a higher SLR than the Pacific Ocean
    coastline. The area at risk is significantly larger on the Caribbean coast than
    on the Pacific coast under all SSP scenarios.
  6: Sector F (Wholesale and retail trade) remains the largest in both years (2019
    and 2020) at 18% of the national GDP. Sector L saw largest increase from 2019
    to 2020.
  7: 12 departments and 86 municipalities are directly affected by projected SLR via
    its effects on potential land loss under the SSP5-8.5 climate scenario. The departments
    Antioquia and Valle del Cauca have a great impact on the national GDP.
Methodology:
  1: The study used sea level rise projections from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report
    (August 2021) to identify areas at risk of land loss along the Caribbean and Pacific
    coastlines of Colombia under five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6,
    SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5).
  2: Uses IPCC scenarios to determine potential land loss due to SLR and assesses
    the current land use of these threatened areas. Uses MERIT DEM data with a resolution
    of 3 arc seconds (~90 m at the equator) to assess land elevation.
  4: The NASA Sea Level Projection Tool is used to project SLR based on IPCC 6th assessment
    report data. Projections include a median (50th percentile) estimate, and low
    confidence 17th and 83rd percentile ranges.
  5: Potential land loss on the Pacific and Caribbean Sea coast due to SLR was calculated
    based on previously projected SSP scenarios. Only the area located within the
    100 km coastal region was used for the calculation.
  6: Analysis of department-level GDP by sector. Analysis of land loss risk due to
    sea level rise within 1 km of coastline.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on identifying and quantifying land loss due to sea level rise
    and discussing the socio-economic implications, but does not provide specific
    quantitative estimates of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  4: "The data uses research-quality data from PSMSL \u2013 GLOSS and fast delivery\
    \ data from the UHSLC for tide gauge stations."
  5: Figures 4 and 5, and Table SM.1 (supplementary material) are relevant. The analysis
    only considers areas within 100 km of the coast. The analysis looks at land loss,
    broken down by land use type.
  6: "The paper identifies specific departments (e.g., Antioquia, C\xB4ordoba) and\
    \ their sectoral GDP contributions. The paper focuses on the impact of sea level\
    \ rise on land use and does not directly quantify the macroeconomic effects of\
    \ land loss."
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Potential socio-economic implications of land loss due to sea level rise in affected
    regions of Colombia are discussed.
  2: Potential impact of SLR with associated land loss on the local population (socio-economic
    discussion).
  4: Sea level rise (SLR) is projected for Buenaventura and Cartagena under different
    Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).
  5: No relevant information
  6: GDP by branch of economic activity at the national and department level.
  7: Potential loss of GDP due to sea level rise impacting agriculture, livestock,
    hunting, forestry, and fishing, which represent almost 10% of the national GDP.
Quantitative Material:
  6: Table 1 presents the Department GDP percentage by branch of economy activity
    (%). Fig. 6 shows Gross Domestic Product by branch of economic activity for the
    year 2019 (a) and 2020 (b) in pie chart form.
Quantitative material:
  1: Under the worst-case scenario (SSP5-8.5), a sea level rise of 1.04 m would threaten
    an area of 2840.64 km2 in Colombia.
  4: Sea level rise projections (meters) are presented graphically for Buenaventura
    and Cartagena from 2020 to 2140 under SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0,
    and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Tabulated values are reported in Table SM.1 (not included).
  5: The Caribbean Sea will undergo a sea level rise between 0.64 m (SSP1-1.9) and
    1.04 m (SPP5-8.5) whereas the Pacific Ocean will experience a lesser impact with
    a sea level rise between 0.35 m (SSP1-1.9) and 0.72 m (SSP5-8.5). An area of 1748
    km2 and 2232 km2 along the Caribbean Sea coast is at risk of permanent loss under
    SSP1-1.9 and SSP5-8.5, respectively, while these numbers are 316 km2 and 609 km2
    for the Pacific coast. The total area at risk within the 100 km zone (on both
    Pacific and Caribbean Sea coast) is around 2064 km2 under SSP1-1.9, 2136 km2 under
    SSP1-2.6, 2424 km2 under SSP2-4.5, 2658 km2 under SSP3-7.0 and 2841 km2 under
    the SSP5-8.5 Scenario.

    loss due to SLR, and GDP per capita by department.
