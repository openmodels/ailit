Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased incidence of extreme rain and changes in rainfall patterns due to climate
    change are drivers of risk, leading to severe floods and poorly drained surface
    water.
  3: Heavy rain leading to flooding (CFI), poorly drained surface water (CRI), and
    other climate conditions affecting rice yield (CHI) and quality (CQI).
  5: Heavy rainfall, specifically the maximum rainfall during August and September.
  6: Socioeconomic factors, climate conditions
  8: Climate factors (CHI, CQI, CRI, CFI), Capital (ln(KKn+KKp)), Economies of Scale
    (ln(MA)), Population (POP).
  9: Temperature and heavy rain impacting rice productivity in Japan.
  10: Temperature (via CHI and CQI, affecting yield and quality), Rainfall (via CRI,
    affecting production costs due to poorly drained surface water), Flooding (via
    CFI, affecting production and costs due to pumping drainage water and repairing
    fields)
  11: Long and heavy rain, floods, poorly drained surface water, temperature changes
    (both increases and decreases)
  12: Temperature changes (TM7, TM8, TM9, TL78) and drought (DYR) are identified as
    drivers of risk impacting crop yield and quality.
Highlights:
  1: Rainfall's impact on TFP fluctuations is more significant than temperature's
    impact, despite lower elasticity, due to substantial variations in annual rainfall.
  3: Heavy rain and associated factors (flooding, poor drainage) influence rice productivity.
    The analysis controls for socioeconomic factors like farm management area, R&D
    investment, and population density.
  6: Northern regions had higher rice productivity than southern regions due to differences
    in socioeconomic factors and climate conditions. Rice TFP of most regions increased
    from 1979 to 2010.
  8: Climate factors (CHI, CQI, CRI) are significant drivers of TFP. Population density
    (POP) is significant for M-index but not T-index. Fixed-effect models are preferred
    over random-effect models. The prediction of TFP by future climate change shows
    similar results with either index.
  9: Negative effects of temperature on rice productivity in southern prefectures;
    multiplicative negative effects when temperature exceeds a threshold.
  10: Socioeconomic factors explain the average chronological trends of TFP, while
    climate factors add variation. In northern Japan, temperature increases TFP because
    temperatures are below the threshold, while elsewhere temperature decreases TFP
    due to exceeding threshold.
  11: Rainfall has a negative impact on rice TFP, and changes in rainfall cause annual
    rice TFP to fluctuate more than temperature changes. Temperature increases can
    be beneficial to rice TFP in northern Japan but harmful in southern Japan.
  12: The fixed-effect model is preferred based on Hausman test results. Temperature
    and drought are statistically significant factors impacting rice crop yield and
    quality.
Methodology:
  1: "Panel data regression analysis is used to estimate causality functions and evaluate\
    \ the impacts of long and heavy rain on Japanese rice TFP. The T\xF6rnqvist-Theil\
    \ and Malmquist indexes are used to measure rice TFP. Climate projections from\
    \ the global-climate model (GCM) are used in conjunction with crop models and\
    \ a hydrological model to predict future impacts."
  3: The paper uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to measure TFP and an econometric
    model (log-linear regression) to assess the impact of climate and socioeconomic
    factors on TFP. R&D capital stocks are estimated using the perpetual-inventory
    (PI) method with a time lag of 3 years and durable years of about 10.
  5: Panel data regression models are used to estimate the relationship between climate
    conditions (including rainfall) and rice Total Factor Productivity (TFP) from
    1979 to 2010 (excluding 1993). Future climate conditions are drawn from the downscaled
    outputs of the MIROC global-climate model under the A1B greenhouse gas emission
    scenario.
  6: Analysis uses T-index and M-index to calculate rice TFP. Nine prefectures representing
    different locations in Japan were selected for analysis.
  8: "Panel data analysis (1979-2010) using T\xF6runqvist-Theil index (T-index) and\
    \ Malmqist index (M-index) to estimate the causal factors of TFP changes in rice\
    \ production across 38 prefectures in Japan. Fixed and random effects models are\
    \ compared using Hausman test."
  9: Analysis of TFP elasticities via climate indices such as CHI, CQI, CRI, and CFI
    across different prefectures in Japan.
  10: Uses Model 1 (T-index) and Model 3 (M-index) with MIROC forecast results to
    predict future rice TFP. T-index considers all factors, M-index considers only
    socioeconomic factors.
  11: Panel data analysis, crop-yield/crop-quality/hydrological models, predictions
    based on MIROC projection results; applicable to Japanese rice TFP under long-term
    climate change.
  12: The study uses panel data analysis with fixed-effect and random-effect models
    to estimate the impact of climate variables on crop yield and quality.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on rice production in Japan and its vulnerability to climate
    change impacts, particularly those related to heavy rainfall.
  3: The study focuses specifically on rice productivity in Japan and controls for
    temperature, solar radiation, and rainfall with crop-yield, crop-quality, and
    hydrological models, respectively to avoid endogeneity between dependent and independent
    variables.
  6: Nine out of 38 prefectures were excluded from the analysis because of missing
    data on rice production.
  9: Regional classification and variable differences slightly altered estimated values;
    elasticities are context-dependent, varying across regions and years.
  10: The M-index vertical axis is set 0.5 points higher than the T-index axis for
    comparison. Annual fluctuations in rain and floods far exceeded temperature, indicating
    higher variability in rain and flood impact.
  11: The paper suggests government support for consolidating drainage systems in
    fields to mitigate the negative impacts of rain.
  12: The study focuses on rice production in Japan. Future studies should consider
    other agricultural products, countries, and causative factors like human and public
    physical capital and ripple effects on the economy.

  9: TFP (Total Factor Productivity) elasticity values with respect to temperature
    and rainfall provided.

    of rain reduce TFP by -2.5% to -4.5%.
  11: Heavy rain/floods decrease rice TFP by 2.5 to 4.5%. Figures 9 and 10 display
    standard deviations for TFP (T-index) caused by temperature and rainfall changes.

    estimations of a crop-quality model using panel data from 38 regions and 31 years
    (1979-1992, 1994-2010).
