Drivers of Risk:
  3: Environmental change (temperature and precipitation variability); Lack of access
    to schooling
  6: Periodic droughts, dry spells, excessive rain causing diseases, frost in high
    altitudes, lower and variable rainfall contributing to persistent food insecurity.
  7: No relevant information
  12: Climate variability (temperature and precipitation)
  15: No relevant information
  20: Hot springs and summers contribute to reduced food availability, impacting households'
    food security and potentially leading to educational disruptions.
  21: Hotter summers, greater winter precipitation, wetter summers, precipitation
    during the Kiremt growing season (summer), warmer spring, wetter spring
  24: Climate change impacts such as droughts and heat waves affecting agricultural
    production and income in sub-Saharan Africa.
  36: Climate variables (spring, summer, and winter temperatures and precipitation)
    during early childhood.
  38: 'The drivers of risk are climate variables: "Number of hot winters," "Number
    of cold winters," "Number of wet winters," and "Number of dry winters."'
  39: 'The main drivers of risk are climate variables: Summer temperature (t-1), Summer
    precipitation (t-1), Winter temperature (t), Winter precipitation (t), Spring
    temperature (t), and Spring precipitation (t).'

Highlights:
  3: Environmental change and lack of access to schooling are linked to the ability
    for agricultural households to improve living standards; Lowered educational attainment
    could be an important, unexplored pathway by which future climate change undermines
    gains in human development.

  20: Warmer and drier springs and summers lead to decreased food availability, this
    may indirectly affect other aspects like education.
  21: Hot summers reduce agricultural production for teff. More rainfall during the
    Kiremt growing season is beneficial for cereal crop yields. Higher summer precipitation
    is associated with a lower likelihood of boys engaging in farm labor.
  24: Warmer winters in rural Ethiopia may benefit schooling outcomes for agricultural
    households due to reduced frost risk in highlands.
  36: Spring and summer temperatures have a negative effect on completing at least
    one grade. Summer precipitation has a positive effect on school attendance. Winter
    temperatures have a positive effect on completing at least one grade.
  38: The "Number of hot winters" coefficient is statistically significant at the
    p < 0.001 level in at least one model. The joint test of schooling coefficients
    is also highly significant (p < 0.001).
  39: Summer temperature in the prior year has a statistically significant negative
    impact on per capita food consumption and a positive impact on household food
    insecurity. Climate variables show significant impacts on crop yields, most notably
    summer temperature's negative impact on Teff yields. There are significant relationships
    between climate variables and various economic conditions, however these may not
    be directly and immediately useful for macro-fiscal projections. The number of
    children in a household significantly reduces per capita food consumption.

Methodology:
  3: The paper aims to examine the intersection between environmental change and education
    by studying how temperature and precipitation variability impact schooling outcomes
    in rural Ethiopia.
  7: No relevant information
  12: "Climate data (temperature and precipitation) from the CRU Time Series (0.5\u02DA\
    \ latitude by 0.5\u02DA longitude resolution, interpolated from over 4,000 weather\
    \ stations) is linked to village-level survey data using GPS coordinates to generate\
    \ measures of temperature and precipitation variability at the village-year scale."
  15: Binary logistic regression models predicting the likelihood of having completed
    at least one grade of schooling and separately the likelihood of attending school
    during the year of the survey. The primary predictors were seasonal climatic conditions
    during early childhood.
  20: OLS regression and logit models used to analyze relationship between climatic
    conditions and food consumption and food security.
  21: Analysis of relationship between climatic conditions and child labor, agricultural
    outcomes. Applicable to the study households, but data limitations prevent strong
    conclusions.
  36: Logistic regression models are used to predict the effect of early childhood
    climate on educational outcomes. Includes controls for individual and household
    characteristics, as well as community and survey year fixed effects.
  38: The analysis uses a model with control variables (not shown) and a Wald test
    for the schooling coefficients in relation to climate variables. The significance
    levels are indicated by asterisks.
  39: The analysis uses regression models with household controls (number of children,
    age/education of household head, household gender, land area), climate variables,
    community fixed-effects, and survey year fixed-effects. The food security data
    comes from the 2004 and 2009 survey rounds. The use of lagged climate variables
    suggests an attempt to capture the impact of past weather conditions on current
    outcomes.

More Notes:
  3: Ethiopia is particularly vulnerable due to its high rural population, agricultural
    dependence, and low irrigation.
  6: Cool nighttime temperatures in highland Ethiopia are crucial for crop production,
    helping slow evaporation and extend crop development.
  7: This page primarily discusses climate change impacts on agriculture and educational
    outcomes in Ethiopia and other developing countries. It does not contain any information
    about macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, or the costs/benefits of adaptation
    at a national level.
  12: The study focuses on sub-Saharan Africa, and the data spans from 1970 to 2009.
  15: The study focuses on the impact of climatic conditions on educational attainment,
    not macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes. The analyzed data are from 1999, 2004,
    and 2009 survey rounds. The analytic sample consists of 3,336 individuals (1,720
    boys and 1,616 girls) from 1,227 households.
  24: The paper emphasizes the need for a nuanced understanding of how climate change
    affects households across different agro-ecological zones, beyond agriculture,
    migration, and conflict.
  36: The analysis uses 'joint tests' for assessing significance of overall effect
    of climate variables. Interactions between gender and climate variables are also
    considered, though they're not generally significant in this excerpt.
  38: The table is continued from a previous page ("Table 3 continued"). The models
    include control variables that are not shown.
  39: The use of logged variables implies a percentage change interpretation of coefficients.
    The fixed effects control for unobserved heterogeneity across communities and
    survey years. The specific geographical scope and time period of the data are
    not explicitly stated on this page.

    and school attendance, not macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.'
  38: The outcomes of interest are related to "schooling coefficients," implicitly
    suggesting an impact on human capital or education levels.
  39: This paper models per capita food consumption (logged), household experienced
    food insecurity during prior rainy season, and crop yields (logged) for Teff,
    Barley, Maize, and Wheat. These are not direct macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes
    but are related to economic well-being and agricultural productivity, which can
    influence macroeconomic variables.

    is also given (271.76, 186.32) with significance.'
  39: The table provides coefficients, odds ratios, and significance levels for the
    impact of climate variables and household controls on the outcomes. For example,
    a 1-unit increase in summer temperature in the prior period (t-1) is associated
    with a -0.18 decrease in logged per capita food consumption and an odds ratio
    of 1.50 for household food insecurity during the prior rainy season. It also has
    a coefficient of -0.61 for Teff yields. All crop yields are logged.
