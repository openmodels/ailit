Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate-related changes, global warming, sea level rise, water scarcity
  7: Reduced availability of water resources (KR3); Flood risks for people, infrastructure,
    and cultural heritage (KR4) due to riverine, pluvial, and coastal flooding.
  10: Water scarcity exacerbated by global warming, interactions with mitigation actions
  11: Global warming; Water scarcity; Limited adaptive capacity; Risks interconnection;
    Land use conflicts (protected areas vs. agriculture)
  16: Adaptation to a 1.5/C14C warmer climate
Highlights:
  2: Adaptation pathways can diverge leading to radically different futures as global
    warming level increases; Adaptation measures for different risks interact resulting
    in trade-offs.
  10: Combination of all options needed as global warming intensifies
  11: Adaptation strategies to reduce crop losses are limited by water availability,
    which is constrained by warming. Over-reliance on irrigation can exacerbate water
    scarcity. Increasing protected areas can limit land for crop production and climate
    mitigation.
  16: If we are to adapt to a 1.5/C14C warmer climate in the next couple of decades,
    it must be done continuously and dynamically.
Methodology:
  2: Illustrative pathways built on quantitative and qualitative assessment of adaptation
    effectiveness inform adaptation planning.
  10: Illustrative flowchart showing pathways for water scarcity adaptation options
    over time
  16: Illustrative pathways allow the design of a world where climate change adaptation
    takes place as the options for adaptation become increasingly more complex and
    constrained.
More Notes:
  7: The table outlines characteristics of adaptation options and synergies/trade-offs
    between Key Risks (KRs). It presents adaptation options for Water scarcity (KR3)
    and Floods (KR4).
  10: Challenges indicated for implementing combined adaptation options due to long
    lead time and interaction with greenhouse gas emissions
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Adaptation effectiveness; Economic costs and benefits of adaptation (implied)
  7: Potential for cascading impacts beyond the water sector (KR3), i.e., on agriculture,
    energy, and industry due to reduced water availability; Potential for maladaptation
    with ecosystems (KR3) due to water extraction and diversion; Potential for maladaptation
    and adverse impacts to ecosystems (KR4) due to flood defenses.
