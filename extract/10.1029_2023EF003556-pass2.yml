  6: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  2: Anthropogenic warming leading to increased global surface temperature, increased
    frequency of extreme precipitation events, and a more volatile and hotter atmosphere.
  7: Changes in precipitation patterns driven by different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
    (SSPs), specifically altered rainfall intensity and distribution across India.
  8: Changes in precipitation patterns (increased flooding in some basins, decreased
    precipitation in others) driven by different climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5).
  10: Variability in the Indian monsoon under different projected warming scenarios
    of CMIP6, intensified moisture flux from the Arabian Sea, El Nino Southern Oscillation
    (ENSO), high surface pressure over the Tibet region, decrease in rainfall, extreme
    temperature increase.
  11: Changes in the intensity of extreme precipitation events (Rx5day), consecutive
    dry days (CDD), and consecutive wet days (CWD) projected under different SSP scenarios
    (SSP 126, SSP 245, SSP 370, SSP 585). Low to high emissions and human-made anthropogenic
    land use.
  16: Changes in the frequency of hydro-climate extreme events; intensification of
    extreme rainfall; increasing global temperature; variations in dryness to wetness
    in different SSPs scenarios.

Highlights:
  2: India is one of the world's most vulnerable countries to hydro-climatic extremes,
    affecting agricultural production and the nation's GDP.
  7: Areal mean precipitation is projected to increase from low to high emission scenarios.
    Spatial changes in precipitation over Indian River Basins (IRBs) show intense
    variation.
  8: "Central IRBs (Narmada, Tapti, Mahi, and west-flowing river basins) are projected\
    \ to experience a significant increase in precipitation, while the Indus River\
    \ basin is projected to be very deficient in mean precipitation. The West flowing\
    \ Tapti to Tadri and Bharamputra river basins are projected to increase precipitation\
    \ (200\u2013500 mm/day), which leads to more flood conditions over the basin catchment\
    \ area."
  10: Projects potential for flash drought intensification in the Ganga River Basin
    due to enhanced land-atmospheric and inter-annual climate variability. Also projects
    potential urban flooding in peninsular Indian cities due to increased precipitation.
  11: Projected increase in extreme precipitation intensity and frequency across various
    river basins in India under different SSP scenarios. Increase in both consecutive
    dry and wet days depending on the region.
  16: Extreme rainfall is projected to increase and intensify throughout the 21st
    century, especially after the 2040s. Western Ghats, Indus, West, and central IRBs
    will be highly vulnerable due to intensification of extreme rainfall. Major cities
    like Mumbai and Pune are at high potential for urban flooding.

Methodology:
  2: This study used the most recent Earth system models (ESMs) and extensive climate
    model experiments from the sixth phase of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
    (CMIP) to examine the changes in extremes. It also utilizes indices developed
    by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI).
  7: The study uses climate model simulations (CMIP6) to project changes in precipitation
    patterns over Indian River Basins (IRBs) from 2021 to 2100 under different SSP
    scenarios. The spatial pattern of observed rainfall from IMD and Multi-modal Mean
    (MMM) of simulated outputs CMIP6.
  8: Analysis of daily, monthly, and yearly precipitation trends from 2021 to 2100
    under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).
  10: Analysis of monthly mean precipitation climatology for monsoon season over the
    IRBs at low (SSP1-2.6) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios based on CMIP6 climate
    models.
  11: "Analysis of observed (1951\u20132021), historical (1951\u20132014), and projected\
    \ (2021\u20132100) changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation\
    \ events using different SSP scenarios."
  16: Uses CMIP6 model simulations, multi-model mean (MMM) approach, and SPI (Standardized
    Precipitation Index).
  17: The study uses observed and CMIP6 data sets to analyze precipitation trends
    and bias correction.
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on Indian River Basins (IRBs) and projects warmer and wetter
    climates leading to variability in hydro-climate extremes, especially during the
    monsoon season.
  7: The study focuses on precipitation changes and does not directly link these changes
    to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. The reference to Trenberth et al. (2003)
    only says that areas with higher mean rainfall have a greater potential for extreme
    rainfall, which is a qualitative statement about risk rather than a specific quantifiable
    risk itself.
  8: The differences among SSPs are more distinct at the monthly scale due to variations
    in human activities, such as energy consumption and agricultural practices, which
    influence greenhouse gas emissions and land use changes.
  10: Sugarcane crop's sugar content in the Ganga river Basin may be affected by decreased
    rainfall and increased temperatures. The analysis covers the period from June
    to September (JJAS).
  11: The analysis focuses on spatial changes in extreme precipitation events, including
    the intensity of rainfall over 5-day periods (Rx5day), consecutive dry days (CDD),
    and consecutive wet days (CWD).
  16: The findings support basin-wise climate adaptation and mitigation strategies,
    including water and emergency services policies. Regional study reliability is
    challengeable due to uncertainty between the models output and its coarser resolution.
    The extreme pattern observed under SSP1-2.6 to SSP3-7.0 suggests low to high challenges
    to mitigation and adaptation strategies, but that may not be as prominent or consistent
    under the high-emission scenario of SSP5-8.5 over different IRBs.

    and Technology, New Delhi. It also provides links to data and software used in
    the analysis.
