Drivers of Risk:
  1: The primary driver of risk examined is human-induced ocean warming, specifically
    changes in sea surface temperature.
  2: "Increasing human influence on regional temperatures (SST anomalies \u2A7E observed)."
  3: Sea surface temperature (SST) climatology bias and trend, interannual SST variability,
    and interannual SST autocorrelation were used as weighting criteria for climate
    models.
  4: "Ocean temperature (three-year running mean SST) is a key driver affecting sockeye\
    \ productivity. North Pacific warming levels (preindustrial, 1950 to 0.5 \u25E6\
    C warming, 0.5 \u25E6 to 1.0 \u25E6 warming, 1.0 \u25E6 to 1.5 \u25E6 warming,\
    \ 1.5 \u25E6C to 2.0 \u25E6C warming) are considered."
  5: Human-induced climate change is the primary driver impacting SST anomalies, highlighted
    by the Fraction of Attributable Risk.
  6: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies and human influence on these temperatures
    are considered drivers of risk.
  7: Annual and three-year running mean sea surface temperature (SST) in the North
    Pacific Ocean and regional ecosystems.
  8: The paper identifies the shocks impacting outcomes as increased sea surface temperatures
    due to human influence, particularly noting a persistent trend of warming in the
    North Pacific since the 1970s or 1980s.
  9: Anthropogenically forced warming of the North Pacific, specifically sea surface
    temperatures (SST).
  12: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is used as a factor influencing sockeye salmon
    catch.
  13: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and freshwater anomaly rate (FAR) are identified
    as drivers impacting salmon catch.

Highlights:
  1: "Human influence on regional ocean temperatures could be detected in the 1970s\
    \ and grew until 2014\u20132020. Temperatures in the North Pacific have reached\
    \ levels likely impossible in the preindustrial climate. The strongest evidence\
    \ for human influence is in the Eastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska. Increasing\
    \ human influence on regional temperatures (increasing FAR values) is linked to\
    \ negative impacts on sockeye fishery catches."
  2: Builds attribution time series to document the evolution of human influence on
    North Pacific and regional SST. Evaluates changes in the expected return time
    for extreme SST events. Demonstrates the potential of attribution statistics for
    contextualizing climate change and informing adaptation decision-making by comparing
    outcomes for fisheries catch under different degrees of human influence on the
    climate.
  3: No relevant information
  4: North Pacific SST has effectively become fixed in an anthropogenic state. All
    five regions, plus the overall North Pacific, have reached temperatures that can
    be attributed to human activities with high confidence (i.e. FAR > 0.98).
  5: The analysis shows a north-south gradient in the attributable risk of SST anomalies,
    with the highest risk in northern ecosystems consistent with Arctic amplification.
  6: Strongest evidence for anthropogenic influence is seen in the northernmost region
    (Eastern Bering Sea). Stakeholders should expect repeat events to be much more
    common in the Gulf of Alaska than in the Bering Sea. A decline of 39% in raw catch
    is expected due to high-FAR years.
  7: "Temperatures at or above the critical threshold were rare to uncommon events\
    \ in historical climates (0% of three-year running mean SST values in the preindustrial\
    \ climate, 1.4% between 1950 and 0.5 \u25E6C warming, 20% for 0.5 \u25E6C\u2013\
    1.0 \u25E6C of warming). But the critical threshold is close to the median value\
    \ in the current climate (49% of values above the threshold for 1.0 \u25E6C\u2013\
    1.5 \u25E6C of warming). And the critical threshold is projected to represent\
    \ cooler-than-normal conditions at 1.5 \u25E6C\u20132.0 \u25E6C warming (80% of\
    \ values at or above the threshold)."
  8: The paper highlights that recent SST levels in the North Pacific have reached
    unprecedented heights attributable to human activities, altering sockeye salmon
    catch outcomes.
  9: "Human activities have made extreme SST events in the North Pacific tens of thousands\
    \ of times more likely. The evidence for human influence on North Pacific temperatures\
    \ is stronger for three-year running mean SST than for annual SST values. Deleterious\
    \ temperatures for sockeye salmon should be expected often in the current climate,\
    \ and temperatures necessary for healthy catches will become rare once North Pacific\
    \ warming exceeds 1.5 \xB0C."

    Pacific, Eastern Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, British Columbia Coast, Northern
    California Current, and Southern California Current).
  13: "SST is projected to increase across various regions of the Pacific Ocean by\
    \ 2100. The proportion of true values falling between the 10th and 90th quantiles\
    \ of weighted prediction varies with the shape parameter \u03C3D."

Methodology:
  1: The study uses Bayesian estimates of FAR and RR derived from 23 global climate
    models to assess the growth in human influence on ocean temperatures over the
    period 1950-2022. Attribution time series are used to contextualize the impacts
    of human-induced ocean warming on ecosystem services.
  2: "Uses Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) to attribute the human contribution\
    \ to observed SST anomalies, calculated from individual ensemble members for 23\
    \ Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models, using normalized\
    \ SST anomalies relative to the pre-1950 time series (1854\u20131949 for observations,\
    \ 1850\u20131949 for CMIP6).  Calculates FAR for both annual and three-year running\
    \ mean values of SST. Weights CMIP6 models to reward model skill and independence."
  3: The study uses 23 CMIP6 models, historical runs, SSP5-8.5, and SSP2-4.5 scenarios.
    A binomial Bayesian regression model is used to weight probabilities from each
    CMIP6 model. Model weighting is based on the difference between model output and
    observations of fundamental physical properties. Expected return time is used
    to evaluate the likelihood of extreme climate events.
  4: Uses Bayesian regression models, CMIP6 climate model data, and historical catch
    data (1989-2022). Weighted Bayesian regression is used to estimate the CMIP6 multi-model
    probability of extreme events. The timing of warming increments is estimated using
    Bayesian smoothed regression. An autocorrelation term is included in the regression
    model to account for serial dependence in catch. Models were fit using Stan 2.21.0
    and R 4.1.2.
  6: Bayesian posteriors with 95% credible intervals used to determine when FAR values
    could not be distinguished from zero. Extreme event return times are analyzed
    for SST values. Regression of sockeye salmon catches on SST and FAR values is
    performed.
  7: "Multi-model estimates of the Risk Ratio (RR) for annual and three-year running\
    \ mean sea surface temperature (SST) with 95% credible intervals, 1950\u20132022."
  8: The analysis is performed using Bayesian regression, observing trends in SST
    and catch anomalies from 1950 to 2019, and examining changes in attributable risk
    over time.
  12: Model weights are calculated using skill and independence, combined and scaled
    by the mean weight for each region; SST values are weighted averages across ocean
    entry years.
  13: CMIP6 models are used to project SST. Model weights are normalized and combined.
    A perfect model setup is used to select shape parameters for weighting CMIP6 models.
    Continuous regressions of catch on SST and FAR were performed with year as a covariate
    to account for serial dependence. Weakly informative priors were used for all
    model parameters.

More Notes:
  1: The study suggests that attribution time series can be helpful indicators for
    understanding and planning for the effects of climate change. The study uses the
    Gulf of Alaska sockeye salmon fishery as an example to demonstrate how attribution
    time series can be used to contextualize the impacts of human-induced ocean warming
    on ecosystem services.
  2: The regional focus is motivated by the scale over which fisheries are typically
    managed. Population dynamics for exploited fishes are affected by climate conditions
    at multiple life stages, so average conditions over several years may be more
    important for fisheries yield than annual conditions.
  3: The study area includes the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS), Gulf of Alaska (GOA), British
    Columbia Coast (BCC), Northern California Current (NCC), and Southern California
    Current (SCC).
  4: The analysis contextualizes climate impacts with attribution time series, showing
    how the human role in observed climate change impacts ecosystem services.
  6: FAR values cannot exceed one, reducing the sensitivity of this metric at high
    levels of human influence.
  7: Focuses on sea surface temperature (SST) and its impact on fisheries, particularly
    changes in climate risk for fisheries due to warming.
  9: The paper acknowledges the limitations of using global climate models for regional-scale
    analysis and notes that atmosphere-ocean circulation plays an important role in
    regional SST. There is the possibility of a transition to a novel state in the
    Eastern Bering Sea that is poorly represented in multi-model projections.
  10: The study focuses on tracking the evolution of human influence on North Pacific
    sea surface temperature.
  12: South Alaska Peninsula was excluded because most sockeye salmon harvests are
    for fish returning to Bering Sea natal streams; Age-structured data is used to
    calculate sockeye salmon ocean entry proportions.

    2014). Model weights are indicated by line color in SST projection plots."

Quantitative material:
  1: "The study provides Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) and Risk Ratio (RR) values\
    \ derived from climate models. FAR values > 0.98 were observed in at least one\
    \ year for all regions. Extreme regional SST values expected every 1000\u2013\
    10000 years in the preindustrial climate are now expected every 5\u201340 years.\
    \ Sockeye salmon catches were 1.4 standard deviations below the long-term log\
    \ mean in years with FAR >= 0.98."
  2: "Calculates Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) and Risk Ratio (RR) for SST observations\
    \ from 1950\u20132022, averaged over six areas. Provides estimates of climate\
    \ risk to fisheries catch during historical, current, and next-decade climate\
    \ states."
  3: "The study area includes five regional ecosystems in the North Pacific basin\
    \ with 1854\u20132022 mean sea surface temperature (SST) plotted."
  4: Average ex-vessel value of the fishery is $64.4M USD during the last decade.
    FAR (Fraction of Attributable Risk) > 0.98 indicates strong evidence for anthropogenic
    impacts. North Pacific SST has FAR >= 0.99 for three-year running mean SST since
    2003, and for annual SST since 2013.
  5: The Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) indicates that SST anomalies were more
    than twice as likely due to human influence (FAR > 0.5) in some northern regions
    since 1984.
  6: Eastern Bering Sea exceeded FAR values of 0.99 for three-year running mean SSTs
    as early as 2003/2004, annual SST FAR values exceeded 0.99 for each year from
    2014 through 2020. Gulf of Alaska and British Columbia Coast exceeded 0.98 for
    at least two years since 2015. Anomalies as large as the largest annual SST anomaly
    in the Eastern Bering Sea (5.08 SD) are expected every ~40 years in the current
    climate (1.0-1.5 deg C warming). Decline of 1.4SD in ln(catch) for high-FAR years
    (FAR >= 0.98), corresponding to a 39% decline in raw catch relative to low-FAR
    years.
  7: FAR values in the high-anthropogenic state (FAR >= 0.98) correspond with a critical
    threshold of three-year running mean SST 2.08 SD above the pre-1950 climatology.
  8: The paper presents relationships between SST anomalies and log catch anomalies
    as well as Fraction of Attributable Risk values, with relative risk values (RR)
    indicating overwhelming human influence on regional temperatures.
  9: "Temperatures corresponding to a FAR (Fraction of Attributable Risk) >= 0.98\
    \ are associated with a 1.4 SD decline in log-transformed sockeye salmon catch.\
    \ The frequency of deleterious temperatures for sockeye salmon is expected to\
    \ be as often as not in the current climate, and temperatures necessary for healthy\
    \ catches will become rare once North Pacific warming exceeds 1.5 \xB0C."
