Drivers of Risk:
  1: Human-induced ocean warming impacting ecosystem services, specifically sockeye
    salmon fisheries.
  6: Increasing sea surface temperatures (SST) due to human influence.
Highlights:
  1: "Human influence on regional ocean temperatures could first be detected in the\
    \ 1970s and grew until 2014\u20132020 temperatures showed overwhelming evidence\
    \ of human contribution. Temperatures have reached levels that were likely impossible\
    \ in the preindustrial climate at the basin scale. Extreme regional SST values\
    \ that were expected every 1000\u201310000 years in the preindustrial climate\
    \ are expected every 5\u201340 years in the current climate."
  6: Declines in sockeye harvests can be statistically related to the increasing evidence
    for human influence on Gulf of Alaska climate. Recent SST anomalies are far more
    likely due to human influence.
Methodology:
  1: Climate attribution techniques applied to sea surface temperature time series
    from five regional North Pacific ecosystems using Bayesian estimates of Fraction
    of Attributable Risk (FAR) and Risk Ratio (RR) derived from 23 global climate
    models (1950-2022).
  6: Regression of sockeye salmon catches on SST and FAR values. Bayesian posteriors
    with 95% credible intervals.
More Notes:
  1: Attribution time series may be helpful indicators for defining the human role
    in observed climate change impacts, and may thus help researchers, managers, and
    stakeholders to better understand and plan for the effects of climate change.
  6: "The paper focuses on the impact of climate change on the Eastern Bering Sea,\
    \ Gulf of Alaska, British Columbia Coast, and California Current ecosystems. FAR\
    \ values for catch years 2017\u20132022 were between 0.98 and 0.99, temperatures\
    \ were 60-190 times more likely due to human influence"

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Negative warming effects on sockeye salmon fishery catches are linked to increasing
    human influence on regional temperatures (increasing FAR values). Sockeye salmon
    migrating to sea in years with the strongest evidence for human effects on temperature
    (FAR >= 0.98) produce catches 1.4 standard deviations below the long-term log
    mean.
  6: Decline in sockeye salmon harvests.
Quantitative material:
  1: Sockeye salmon migrating to sea in years with FAR >= 0.98 produce catches 1.4
    standard deviations below the long-term log mean.
  6: "Anomalies that were exceedingly rare have become common events; Eastern Bering\
    \ Sea has experienced the largest annual SST anomaly to date of any of the regions\
    \ (5.08 SD); decline of 1.4SD in ln(catch) for the high-FAR years (FAR\u2A7E 0.98),\
    \ which corresponds to a 39% decline in raw catch relative."
