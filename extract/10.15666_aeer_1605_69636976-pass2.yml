Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (irregular precipitation, irregular wind directions, increased
    level of drought), increased greenhouse gas release, population, agricultural
    fields within total area, agricultural added value, GDP
  2: Greenhouse gas emissions from sectors like electricity generation, agricultural
    production, and transportation.
  3: Climate change and global warming affect the agricultural sector, which is highly
    dependent on climate events, leading to food supply issues.
  4: Population and national income per capita are identified as important determinants
    of global warming and climate change, rooted in human activity.
  5: CO2 release is considered a risk factor, influenced by agricultural land share,
    agricultural added value, GDP, and population.
  6: "CO2 emissions (Y), Share of agricultural fields within total area (\u03C7),\
    \ Agricultural added value (\u03C3), Population (\u03B4)"
  9: "The share of agricultural fields within the total area (\u03C7), agricultural\
    \ added value (\u03C3), GDP per capita (\u03BB), and population (\u03B4) are considered\
    \ drivers of CO2 emissions."
  11: "Climate change, represented by CO2 emissions (Y), agricultural land share (\u03C7\
    ), agricultural added value (\u03C3), and population (\u03B4)."
  12: Population; Share of agricultural fields within the total area; CO2 level
Highlights:
  1: The effect of population was determined to be greater than that of the other
    variables in both regions on CO2 release. All of the variables under study had
    an increasing effect on CO2 release in the long term in the Eurasian Region, while
    the share of the agricultural areas within total area and the GDP variables had
    an effect to reduce CO2 release.
  2: "A 1\xB0C increase in global warming is estimated to lead to an annual economic\
    \ cost of 2 trillion dollars in 2050."
  4: Agricultural added value, population, and GDP have movements in the same direction
    in Eurasian countries (excluding the Russian Federation with respect to agricultural
    field). The trend of GDP per capita and CO2 emissions appear to show some correlation.
  5: CO2 release in Turkey develops in the same trend as agricultural area, agricultural
    added value, population, and GDP, though the interaction of agricultural fields
    and CO2 should be kept separate after 2005 due to urbanization.
  9: The ARDL results suggest that the share of agricultural fields, agricultural
    added value, GDP per capita, and population are statistically important in explaining
    CO2 emissions in the long run for both Eurasia and Turkey.
  11: In Eurasia, agricultural land share causes population changes in the short term,
    and agricultural added value causes GDP changes. In Turkey, there are short-run
    causal relationships from CO2 to population, agricultural land to GDP, agricultural
    added value to population, population to CO2, agricultural fields and agricultural
    added value, and GDP to population. The speed of adjustment to equilibrium for
    CO2 levels differs significantly between Eurasia (71 years) and Turkey (9 months).
  12: Population was determined to be the most effective variable increasing CO2 levels
    in the long run in both the Eurasian region and Turkey; Agricultural added value
    increases CO2 release in both regions; Positive relationship between GDP and environmental
    destruction in underdeveloped countries, negative relationship in developed countries.
Methodology:
  1: Econometric models like ADF unit square test, ARDL and VECM were used to examine
    the effects of variables including the share of the agricultural fields within
    total area, agricultural added value, GDP and population on the CO2 release within
    the scale of the Eurasian Region and Turkey.
  3: The study intends to bring a perspective from the agricultural dimension to the
    greenhouse effect. Eurasian countries and Turkey were selected as the study region.
  4: The study examines the development trends of Eurasian countries and Turkey between
    1993 and 2016 with respect to agricultural added value, agricultural land, population,
    GDP and CO2 emissions. The trends of CO2 and other variables are examined in relation
    to econometric results.
  5: The study investigates factors affecting CO2 release in Eurasian countries and
    Turkey between 1993 and 2016, including agricultural areas share, agricultural
    added value, GDP, and population, with Eurasia defined as the region from the
    United Kingdom to Japan.
  6: Panel data analysis and time series analysis using Unit root test (ADF), Autoregressive
    distributed lag bound test (ARDL), and Vector error correction model (VECM) to
    analyze the relationship between CO2 emissions and other variables in Eurasian
    countries and Turkey. The analysis covers a period of time sufficient to utilize
    panel data and time series techniques (though the exact time frame is not mentioned).
  8: The study uses an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model and a Vector Error
    Correction Model (VECM) to analyze the relationships between variables. Co-integration
    between series was searched and then the long term ARDL model on the greenhouse
    release and error correction model (VECM) was estimated. The VECM model estimates
    short and long term flexibilities and deviation from balance. Unit root tests
    are performed before evaluating relationships. The F-test is used to determine
    the presence of long term co-integration between the variables.
  9: The paper uses Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root tests to determine the
    stationarity of the variables. Based on the unit root test results, the paper
    uses an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to analyze the long-run relationships
    between the variables. The analysis is applicable to some Eurasian countries and
    Turkey.
  11: Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) is used to analyze short-run causality
    and long-run relationships between CO2 emissions, agricultural land share, agricultural
    added value, GDP per capita, and population. The analysis is applicable to a panel
    of Eurasian countries and Turkey during an unspecified period (presumably 1993-2016,
    based on later mention, but not explicitly stated here).
  12: VECM analysis; Causality analysis (short-run and long-run)
More Notes:
  1: Awareness of individuals and state rulers on environmental destruction or environmental
    cost is considered important. Agricultural production system planning within an
    environmental dimension is needed and this needs to become a state policy. When
    creating these policies, avoid practices causing difficulty in meeting the food
    demand of the population or causing excessive increases in food prices.
  2: The paper uses sectoral greenhouse gas release data from IPCC (2014a) to relate
    energy consumption to climate change impacts on economic sectors.
  3: The paper mentions a two-way action-reaction process between CO2 production/reduction
    in the agricultural sector but does not explore this relationship.
  5: The study seems to focus on the relationship between CO2 emissions and various
    macroeconomic and demographic factors, primarily using visual analysis of trends,
    but lacks specific quantitative results regarding the economic costs or benefits
    of climate change adaptation.
  6: "The study focuses on Eurasian countries and Turkey. The functional relationship\
    \ tested is ln Y = f(ln \u03C7, ln \u03C3, ln \u03BB, ln \u03B4), where Y is CO2\
    \ emissions, \u03C7 is the share of agricultural fields, \u03C3 is agricultural\
    \ added value, \u03BB is GDP per capita, and \u03B4 is population."
  9: The paper focuses primarily on the drivers of CO2 emissions and does not directly
    address the broader macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks of climate change or
    the costs and benefits of adaptation.
  11: The study examines the relationships between agricultural factors, GDP, population,
    and CO2 emissions, indicating that climate change risks are linked to agricultural
    activities and economic growth. The negative ECT implies a move back to equilibrium.
  12: Study focuses on Eurasian countries and Turkey.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Deterioration of macroeconomic balances of countries, food deficiency, excessive
    increases in food prices
  2: "A 1\xB0C increase in global warming is estimated to lead to an annual economic\
    \ cost of 2 trillion dollars in 2050."
  3: Sectoral economic performance in agriculture is affected by climate events.
  4: GDP is examined as an important determinant in relation to climate change.
  5: GDP is considered as a factor affecting CO2 release.
  6: "GDP per capita (\u03BB)"
  9: "The paper considers GDP per capita (\u03BB) as a potential driver of CO2 emissions\
    \ (Y)."
  11: GDP per capita is one of the variables in the model, and the agricultural added
    value is also used as a proxy for economic activity. The Error Correction Term
    (ECT) for CO2 levels is interpreted as the time it takes for imbalances in CO2
    levels to disappear, impacting overall long-term economic stability due to climate
    change effects.
  12: GDP; Agricultural Added Value
Quantitative material:
  1: Study covers the period between 1993 and 2016 years for Eurasian Region and Turkey
  2: "A 1\xB0C increase in global warming will lead to an annual economic cost of\
    \ 2 trillion dollars in 2050."
  4: Average share of the agricultural added value within GDP between 1993 and 2016
    years is 4.88% in the Russian Federation.
  5: Figure 3 visually represents the interaction between CO2 release and agricultural
    land, agricultural added value, population, and GDP in Turkey from 1993 to 2016.
  6: The study uses panel data analysis for 12 Eurasian countries and time series
    analysis for Turkey, relating CO2 emissions to agricultural land share, agricultural
    added value, GDP per capita, and population. The variables are transformed into
    logarithmic form.
  9: "The paper provides coefficients and t-statistics from an ARDL model examining\
    \ the long-run relationship between CO2 emissions and the other variables (\u03C7\
    , \u03C3, \u03BB, \u03B4) for both Eurasia and Turkey."
  11: The table provides coefficients of short-run causality and error correction
    terms (ECT) for both Eurasia and Turkey, along with significance levels (p-values).
    For example, the ECT for Turkey shows a -1.325 coefficient for the impact of disequilibrium
    in the long-run relationship between the variables on CO2 emissions (Y), significant
    at the 5% level.
  12: Population increase of 2.16% took place in the whole Eurasian region, while
    this increase was 40.22% in Turkey (1993-2006); the share of the agricultural
    fields within the total area of the Eurasian region was 55.09% between 1993 and
    2006 while this value was 51.53% in Turkey.
