Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature; precipitation extremes; tropical cyclones.
  2: Current climatic events like droughts or tropical cyclones, and future climate
    changes.
  3: Weather events drawn from the probability distribution that defines the climate;
    shifts in climate and resulting changes in weather distribution; extreme heat-hours,
    tropical cyclones, ENSO, drought indices, temperature distributions, rainfall
    variability, crop exposure to vapor pressure.
  5: Temperature, cyclone wind speed, rainfall anomalies, and ENSO measures are identified
    as climate variables impacting social and economic outcomes.
  6: No relevant information
  7: Cyclone intensity and countries' historical exposure to similar events.
  9: low rainfall, tropical cyclone strikes, temperatures (both high and low)
  10: Temperature, monsoon characteristics, rainfall, temperature, precipitation,
    cyclones
  11: Typhoons, rainfall shocks, realized temperatures relative to optimal temperatures,
    ENSO conditions
  12: Temperature, tropical cyclones, and ENSO reduce global economic growth and increase
    civil conflict.
  13: Hotter locations with extreme weather patterns face additional health costs,
    lower productivity, and economic costs.
Highlights:
  1: Climate is a major factor affecting social and economic outcomes; Both current
    and future losses can theoretically be avoided if populations adapt to fully insulate
    themselves from the climate.
  2: Climate has a comparable economic and social burden now to the projected impact
    of future climate changes.
  5: Climate variables influence social and economic outcomes in many sectors and
    contexts. Extreme heat or cold can lead to severe cardiovascular, respiratory,
    and cerebrovascular effects that can result in death.
  6: No relevant information
  7: Limited adaptation seen in temperature-induced mortality and maize yields in
    the US, with substantial GDP impacts from high temperatures at county level unchanged
    over time.
  9: Effects of temperature and cyclones are globally generalizable in the sense that
    they have been recovered using subsamples of data from around the world, including
    both rich and poor countries.
  10: Climate trends are already impacting global GDP growth, and future climate change
    is projected to significantly lower global GDP and growth rates. Cyclones have
    measurably lowered global annual growth.
  11: The current climate affects outcomes that are observed in the current world;
    recent warming has affected outcomes; projected changes in the climate are expected
    to alter social outcomes.
  12: Future climate change expected to significantly increase ongoing economic and
    social costs, typically larger than impacts of past warming.
  13: The persistence of adaptation gaps has significant impacts on current and future
    well-being, making understanding these gaps a pressing research question.
Methodology:
  1: Empirical research drawing generalizable causal inferences tying climatic events
    to social outcomes.
  2: Theoretical damage functions describing how global mean temperature translates
    into economic and social costs; empirical research to provide a basis for climate
    policy calculations.
  3: The paper discusses methodologies for identifying causal effects of climate exposure
    on societal outcomes, comparing populations under different climates, while accounting
    for adaptations. It mentions the difficulty of conducting ideal experiments and
    the reliance on 'natural experiments' or quasi-experiments.
  5: Dose-response functions are used to estimate the causal effect of climatological
    events on various social outcomes. The response functions only identify relative
    changes and are either normalized to 'zero effect' at a designated climatic event
    or the sample mean of an outcome.
  6: No relevant information
  7: Comparison of response functions over time and across space to indicate successful
    adaptations or an adaptation gap.
  9: Examining how the macro-economy as a whole responds to climatic conditions by
    examining total income or gross domestic product (GDP) per capita as the outcome
    of interest.
  10: Comparing realized conditions to optimal conditions and quantifying impacts
    on economic outcomes.
  11: Reconstitutes distributions of impacts from climate; compares outcome distributions
    resulting from different climatologies to estimate the effects of any arbitrary
    change in the climate. Computes the distribution of outcomes predicted by the
    current distribution of climatic events and compares it to the distribution of
    outcomes obtained if the same population were exposed to their best possible environmental
    conditions. Deconvolution or regression analysis is implicitly computed and relied
    upon.
  12: Analysis based on empirical measurements and historical observed responses to
    environmental conditions.
  13: The analysis involves understanding adaptation gaps, and whether they reflect
    optimal investments or are bound by market failures and constraints.
More Notes:
  1: The paper emphasizes the importance of understanding both current and future
    climate impacts, and suggests that policies should be designed to address adaptation
    gaps and manage anthropogenic climate change.
  3: The paper emphasizes the challenge of translating climate data collected by physical
    scientists into socially meaningful measures for analysis. It also highlights
    that adaptations alter the dose-response relationship between weather variables
    and social outcomes.
  6: No relevant information
  10: The analysis attributes specific economic outcomes to climate factors, providing
    a quantitative assessment of climate-related economic risks.
  11: Climate change impacts are predicted using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
    Change A1F1, A1B, or RCP 8.5 future climate change scenarios. Adaptation adjustments
    tend to be relatively minor and mathematically second-order.
  12: There are adaptation gaps where some areas adapt more effectively while others
    show little adaptation, impacting economic outcomes.
  13: Adaptation gaps might lead to increased inequality as some populations can adapt
    effectively while others cannot.

    has increased conflict risk in Africa by ~11%.
  5: "In Delhi, deaths increase by 3.2% per \xB0C above 20\xB0C. In the United States,\
    \ days above 90\xB0F (32.2\xB0C) and below 20\xB0F (\u20136.7\xB0C) increase male\

  7: Country-level GDP reductions slightly less severe in rich nations, but not statistically
    different.
  9: "Low rainfall slows national incomes greatly in Africa. Tropical cyclone strikes\
    \ slow GDP growth for roughly 15 years in proportion to the intensity of the storm.\
    \ Output is maximized around 13\xB0C, with a nonlinear effect of temperature on\
    \ economic production. Cyclone-prone countries experience GDP losses (per cyclone)\
    \ much smaller than countries where storms are infrequent. Each increase in temperatures\
    \ by 1\xB0C lowers economic production by roughly 1 to 1.7% when temperatures\
    \ are higher than the optimum."

    \ rate by 0.002 percentage points on average. Predicted climate change by 2100\
    \ lowers global GDP by 23% and between 2010 and 2100 lowers the global annual\
    \ growth rate by 0.28 percentage points on average. Between 1970 and 2008, realized\
    \ cyclones lowered the global annual growth rate between 1970 and 2008 by 1.27\
    \ percentage points. Relative to a full year at 50\xB0 to 60\xB0F, realized temperatures\
    \ lower TFP by 31% on average. Predicted climate change by 2050 lowers annual\
    \ TFP in China by 4.18%."
  11: Typhoon-induced deaths account for 13% of the overall infant mortality rate
    (Philippines, 1950-2008). Rainfall shocks account for 14-21% of cross-country
    variation in HIV prevalence (Sub-Saharan Africa, 2003-2009). Predicted climate
    change by 2100 increases annual mortality rates by 3% and energy use by 11% on

    incidence of war by 11.1% on average (Sub-Saharan Africa). Predicted climate change
    by 2030 increases annual incidence of war by 54% (Sub-Saharan Africa). Relative
    to the optimal state, realized ENSO conditions had a role in 21% of all civil
    conflicts between 1950 and 2004 (Global). Predicted climate change increases total
    crime cases between 2010 and 2099 by 180,000 for rape, 22,000 for murder, and
    2.3 million for aggravated assault (USA).
