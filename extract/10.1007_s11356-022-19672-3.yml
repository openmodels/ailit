Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature shocks, Periods of extreme heat, Low rainfall.
  2: Increasing global temperatures and temperature variations.
  7: Temperature shock (temperature variations of more than 2 standard deviations
    from long-term averages)
  8: Temperature shocks (rising temperatures, heat shock, hot days)
  9: The primary drivers of risk are the number of hot days and temperature shocks
    (lagged by two and three years).
  10: Thermal shocks (temperature shock); rainfall (affecting irrigation costs); temperature
    rises (affecting worker productivity)
  11: Temperature shocks impact agricultural revenues and exacerbate energy poverty,
    especially in Vietnam's northern and central coastal areas.
Highlights:
  1: Temperature shocks have a positive and quantitative impact on energy poverty
    in Vietnam. Temperature shocks reduce agricultural output. Overall income appears
    to be a little mitigating influence on energy poverty, but this may be due to
    underreporting.
  2: Short-term temperature variations have a significant impact on energy poverty;
    agricultural production in Vietnam's north is particularly vulnerable to the effects
    of temperature shocks.
  7: Temperature shocks can increase the likelihood of multidimensional fuel poverty
    and the intensity of fuel poverty. Higher-than-normal temperatures can increase
    household energy bills, while declining agricultural production and labor productivity
    can reduce household income, both of which can affect energy poverty.
  8: Rising temperatures in northern and central coastal areas considerably enhanced
    the prevalence and intensity of multidimensional energy poverty. Heat shock is
    linked to greater MEPI points in southern families, but not to MEPI status. Thermal
    shocks exacerbated the multilayered poverty of rural households as compared to
    urban families
  9: The number of hot days has a statistically significant impact on MEPI status
    and MEPI scores in the Central Coast and Central Highlands regions. Temperature
    shocks lagged by two years have a statistically significant impact on MEPI status
    and MEPI score. The impact of temperature shocks is heterogeneous, differing between
    urban and rural areas, and between Kinh and minority groups.
  10: Thermal shocks have a statistically significant impact on multidimensional energy
    poverty (MEPI status). Reduced agricultural productivity can help alleviate energy
    poverty. Household earnings have a strong negative association with multidimensional
    energy poverty. MEPI score lacks statistical validity with regards to heat shock
    factor.
  11: Higher temperatures significantly contribute to multidimensional energy poverty
    in Vietnam, forcing families to rely on traditional energy sources.
Methodology:
  1: Econometric estimation.
  2: Estimates a linear prediction framework using the Vietnam Household Living Standards
    Survey (VHLSS). Uses random variance of temperature waves over place and time
    to detect effects. Addresses selection of accommodation and probability of becoming
    energy inefficient through this approach. Considers differing macroeconomic trends
    between provinces.
  7: Econometric analysis using logarithmic regression of agricultural productivity
    based on humidity and temperature. Residuals of this regression are used to assess
    the impact of temperature fluctuations. The study also employs robustness tests,
    including actual deviations (levels) and multiple deviation thresholds for temperature
    shocks.
  8: "The model is run independently for each of Vietnam\u2019s four regions. Robustness\
    \ testing is performed using different thermal shock measurements (standard deviations\
    \ from the long-term mean) and different MEPI structures. Regression analysis\
    \ with controls for household factors (age, sex, education level, family size,\
    \ roof type) and geographical characteristics (average rainfall and population\
    \ density)."
  9: The analysis uses regression models with various controls, including household
    factors, geographical characteristics, province and year fixed effects, province-specific
    linear time trends, and survey time fixed effects. The models are applied to different
    areas (North, Central Coast, Central Highlands, South) and different subgroups
    (urban vs. rural, Kinh vs. minorities).
  10: Regression analysis using MEPI status and scoring variables as mediators to
    assess the impact of thermal shocks on multidimensional energy poverty. Fixed
    effects are included for province, year, province*linear time trend, and survey
    time. Robust standard errors are used.
  11: The analysis uses panel-based survey statistics and climate data to examine
    the impact of temperature shocks on multidimensional energy poverty (MEPI).
More Notes:
  1: The study examines the mediating role of financial development and environmental
    considerations on the relationship between temperature shocks and energy poverty
    in Vietnam.
  2: The MEPI (Measure of Energy Poverty Index) was created in response to the findings
    of this research, which accounts for disparities in both the kind and quantity
    of electricity consumed.
  7: The study considers adaptive responses to temperature variations by evaluating
    them based on long-term averages. It acknowledges that adaptation (e.g., air conditioning)
    can mitigate the impact of temperature shocks. Region-specific temperature shocks
    are calculated to account for varying baseline temperatures across Vietnam.
  8: The analysis seems to focus on energy poverty and its link to thermal shocks,
    not on broader macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, although energy poverty could
    have knock-on effects for these. The geographic focus is Vietnam.
  9: The study considers lagged effects of temperature shocks, controls for a range
    of confounding factors, and examines heterogeneity across different regions and
    demographic groups. The standard errors are categorized at the regional level.
  10: The analysis considers the role of household earnings and agricultural production
    in mitigating the impacts of thermal shocks on energy poverty.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Agricultural output, Labor productivity, Income, Energy poverty.
  2: Fuel insecurity in Vietnamese households (referred to as power insecurity).
  7: Agricultural productivity loss, labor productivity loss, increased household
    energy bills
  8: The prevalence and intensity of multidimensional energy poverty (MEPI status
    and score)
  9: The paper examines the impact of temperature shocks and hot days on the Environmental
    Performance Index (EPI), using both MEPI status (likely a binary indicator) and
    MEPI score as dependent variables.
  10: Multidimensional energy poverty (MEPI status and MEPI score); agricultural productivity;
    household income
Quantitative material:
  1: Temperature shocks have a positive and quantitative impact on energy poverty.
  2: "Vietnam\u2019s total energy poverty rate is 19%, with an MEPI rating and MEPI\
    \ score of 0.188."
  7: A 2.5% upsurge in the likelihood of being multidimensional fuel-poor is linked
    to a temperature shock; it is also linked to a 1.2% upsurge in the intensity of
    fuel poverty.
  8: MEPI status and MEPI score rise in response to thermal shocks. Various regression
    results are reported showing the impact of temperature shocks on MEPI status and
    score. A 1 standard deviation temperature increase is fairly common in Vietnam
    (the incidence rate is 58%)
  9: The tables present regression coefficients showing the relationship between the
    number of hot days/temperature shocks and MEPI status/score, along with standard
    errors, R-squared values, and the number of observations.  Table 4 shows, for
    example, that in the Central Coast region, an increase in the number of hot days
    is significantly associated with a higher MEPI status (0.003***) and score (0.002***).  Table
    6 shows that in urban areas, the impacts of temperature shocks are lower than
    in rural areas.
  10: Table 7 presents regression results with temperature shock, total earnings,
    earnings per capita, and agricultural output as predictors of MEPI status and
    MEPI score. Includes coefficients, standard errors, p-values, observations, R-squared,
    and fixed effects.
  11: The robustness test shows minor impact of temperature shock on MEPI status with
    a coefficient of 0.015* for shocks calculated at (t-2).
