Drivers of Risk:
  3: Global climate change and local changes in vegetation cover leading to rainfall
    reduction; high evapotranspiration potential due to solar radiation and high temperatures;
    high inter-annual rainfall variability.
  4: Dependence on hydroelectricity generation, vulnerability to water availability.
  6: Growing water scarcity in the Brazilian semi-arid region and the prospective
    impact of climate change in reducing annual rainfall totals.
  9: High costs have historically been a barrier to widespread deployment of distributed
    PV systems, though these costs have decreased significantly over time.
  10: "The price drop for PV panels in the international market and reductions in\
    \ Brazil\u2019s Central Bank interest rates (SELIC) are identified as factors\
    \ reducing PV generation costs."
  12: Drought years in the NEB (Northeast Brazil) reducing subsistence corn and bean
    cultures, potentially leading to extreme poverty; vulnerability of small farmer
    families to extreme poverty.
  13: Rainfall/season-dependent maize harvest versus daily PV transformation.
  14: Drought in the semi-arid portion of Northeast Brazil, recurrent and increasing
    costs of assistance programs for drought-affected populations worldwide, extreme
    climate events.
  15: Recurrent droughts, semi-arid climate, climate change.

Highlights:
  3: Climate change is predicted to increase water deficit and drier areas in the
    Brazilian Northeast, leading to potential reductions in river flow and rainfall.
    Persistent water crises exacerbate conflicts between different water use stakeholders.
  4: Hybrid generation matrix from renewable sources (especially solar PV) can reduce
    dependence on hydroelectricity and greenhouse gas emissions; distributed PV generation
    is encouraged by ANEEL Normative Resolution 482/2012.
  6: The paper highlights the potential of distributed PV electricity generation for
    regional development and social inclusion in the face of growing water scarcity
    and climate change.
  9: Brazil has ideal conditions for solar energy with significantly higher solar
    irradiance compared to European countries, and there is potential for distributed
    PV generation without conflicting with agriculture or natural ecosystems.
  12: "Distributed PV generation program has the potential to create sustained income\
    \ for small farmer families at risk of extreme poverty during drought years, potentially\
    \ exceeding the benefits from the Bolsa Fam\xEDlia program; using PV energy in-house\
    \ can result in significant annual savings."
  13: PV energy generation has a significantly higher output value per unit area compared
    to rain-fed maize production in the Brazilian Semiarid Northeast.
  14: Distributed generation of PV energy presents a relevant opportunity for income
    earnings unprecedented in the history of Brazil and can lead to vulnerability
    reduction to extreme climate events.
  15: PV energy offers a pathway to perennial income for the Northeast Brazil population;
    distributed PV micro-generation policy is needed; a change in legislation and
    social policies is required.

Methodology:
  6: "The paper evaluates the potential of PV energy generation in the Northeast Brazil\
    \ (NEB) region considering annual average daily irradiance, energy efficiency\
    \ factor, and operational efficiency factor, and it also computes the temporal\
    \ evolution of cumulative rainfall balance. Future rainfall totals are simulated\
    \ using the Brazilian Earth System Model\u2013BESM according to the radiative\
    \ forcing scenario\u2013RCP4.5."
  10: The analysis uses information such as current interest rates and PV system costs
    to estimate the economic feasibility and payoff time of adopting PV energy.
  12: Computes annual average PV production by multiplying PV energy potential by
    PV area; estimates annual gross revenues based on current energy generation market
    value; creates income scenarios based on sale of generated energy to the grid;
    considers alternative of using PV energy for productive processes on the farm;
    defines PV's energy-density value based on electricity production per square meter.
  13: Compares output values of PV energy generation and maize production, using average
    maize productivity for rainy years in the NEB (Brazilian Northeast).

    \ hydroelectric power plant on the S\xE3o Francisco River, but power generation\
    \ prevails as a priority, causing losses to farmers and hampering food supply\
    \ to urban agglomerations."
  4: The National Electric System interconnected distribution network is a definitive
    differential factor in the development of PV potential in the NEB.

    project finance studies for comprehensive cost-benefit analysis.
  12: The analysis focuses on the Northeast Brazil (NEB) region.
  13: The analysis suggests that PV potential can be implemented gradually and modularly,
    employing skilled workers across the region and generating local employment, unlike
    capital-intensive hydroelectric plants.

    of renewable energy projects, especially the motivation of human actors implementing
