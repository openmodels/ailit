Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change leading to increased magnitudes of extreme precipitation events
    in the Northeastern United States.
  8: Increased return periods of precipitation events (25-year, 100-year). Dry and
    wet biases in models affecting peak flow (PF) estimates.
  10: Changes in precipitation patterns impacting the accuracy of climate models.
  12: Changes in precipitation patterns, specifically changes in Pluvial Flooding
    (PF) due to climate change under RCP4.5 scenario.
  13: Climate change, specifically the RCP8.5 emission scenario.
  16: Extreme weather events (implied flood risk as indicated by exceedance probability
    of return periods)
  17: Increased extreme precipitation events in the Northeastern US due to climate
    change (increased temperature and atmospheric water vapor).
Highlights:
  1: Extreme precipitation events in the Northeastern US are likely to increase, with
    a 100-year event potentially becoming a 27-year event under RCP4.5 and a 19-year
    event under RCP8.5 in the second half of the 21st century.
  8: UWPD PF estimates are close to observed PF estimates, especially for shorter
    return periods (2 years). Spatial variations of observational PF estimates are
    well represented by UWPD data. However, as return periods become longer (25 and
    100 years), correlation coefficients decrease and RMSE increases, indicating larger
    errors and uncertainties.
  10: UWPD data outperform other datasets; LOCA data are second best in terms of correlation
    skill; NA-CORDEX shows comparable skill despite coarse resolution; RMSE of BCCAv2
    reflects systematic dry biases.
  12: Pluvial flooding is expected to increase in the future under the RCP4.5 scenario.
    The relative difference ratios, comparing projected PF to historical PF, increase
    over time (from 2006-2053 to 2054-2100) for both 25-year and 100-year return periods.
  13: PF estimates are projected to increase, with varying magnitudes depending on
    the emission scenario, time period, method (UWP, LOCA), and geographical location.
    The Northeast US experiences spatial variation in these changes.
  16: Extreme events (as proxied by exceedance probabilities of different return periods)
    are expected to become more frequent in the future, especially under the RCP8.5
    scenario.
  17: Extreme precipitation events are projected to increase in the Northeastern US,
    with larger increases in the northern part of the domain. For example, under the
    RCP4.5 scenario using the UWPD dataset, the average projected increases to the
    100-year event are 10.79% for the first half of the 21st century and 16.90% for
    the second half. Under RCP8.5, the corresponding increases are 14.18% and 26.75%.
    An event with a current exceedance probability of 0.01 may have an exceedance
    probability for the second half of the 21st century of approximately 0.04.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of observed and modeled daily precipitation frequency (PF) estimates
    in the Northeastern US on the rain gauge station scale based on both annual maximum
    series (AMS) and partial duration series (PDS) methods, using four CMIP5 downscaled
    data sets. Comparison of historical accuracy of data sets and selection of the
    two best-performing to project PF estimates under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.
  5: Presents PF estimate results based on annual maximum series (AMS) and partial
    duration series (PDS) of daily precipitation data, used for PF analysis in hydrology.
  8: Comparison of peak flow (PF) estimates from observed data and downscaled data
    (UWPD and LOCA) using Annual Maximum Series (AMS) and three different Partial
    Duration Series (PDS) methods. Spatial correlation and Root Mean Square Error
    (RMSE) are used to assess the performance of the downscaled data in estimating
    historical PF values.
  10: Statistical downscaling methods are used to generate climate data, which are
    then compared to observed data using correlation and RMSE metrics. Analysis is
    performed across different return periods (2-year, 25-year, 100-year) to assess
    the skill of the downscaled datasets at different time scales. The skill decreases
    as return periods become longer.
  12: The study projects future Pluvial Flooding (PF) using RCP4.5 emission scenario.
    It compares projected PF data for two time periods (2006-2053 and 2054-2100) with
    historical data. PF estimates for return periods of 25 and 100 years are shown
    as examples, assuming stationarity of PF estimates within each period.
  13: "Analysis uses UWPD and LOCA data under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios.\
    \  Calculates relative difference ratios: (PF_future \u2013 PF_historical)/PF_historical\
    \ for return periods of 25 and 100 years."
  16: Calculates exceedance probabilities for different historical return periods
    under different climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) using two different datasets
    (UWPD and LOCA).
  17: Analysis based on observational and climate model data (LOCA, BCCAv2, NA-CORDEX,
    and UWPD) to examine point precipitation frequency (PF) estimates in the Northeastern
    US, using AMS-based and PDS-based methods. The results are applicable to the Northeastern
    US.
More Notes:
  1: 'The study focuses on the Northeastern United States. The analysis uses CMIP5
    downscaled data sets and considers two emission scenarios: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.'
  5: The analysis will mainly focus on the UWPD and LOCA data sets for providing results.
  8: The study identifies dry and wet biases in UWPD data for extremely high and low
    PF estimates, respectively, but concludes that UWPD captures the major features
    of observed PF estimates overall. The study compares PF estimates for different
    return periods to assess model performance under different climate scenarios.
  10: The analysis focuses on the accuracy of different downscaling methods for precipitation
    data, not on the direct macroeconomic or macro-fiscal impacts of climate change
    or adaptation.
  12: The analysis uses relative PF difference ratios to quantify the projected changes.
    It considers two models (UWPD and LOCA) for projections.
  13: The paper does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes.
    It uses changes in precipitation frequency as an indicator, but the economic consequences
    are not elaborated upon on this page.
  16: The analysis focuses on the Northeastern US domain. The paper presents results
    from two different datasets and notes some differences between them (dry bias).
  17: The analysis focuses on precipitation frequency, not directly on economic or
    fiscal outcomes. The geographic complexity of the Northeastern US is acknowledged.

    l). The RMSE increases to \u224813mm for the 25-year return period and to \u2248\
    25mm for the 100-year return period."

    datasets (LOCA, UWPD, NA-CORDEX, BCCAv2) with observed data for various return
    periods (2-year, 25-year, 100-year); Correlation ranges from 0.70 to 0.9; RMSE
    varies across plots (e.g., 43.98 to 52.54).
  12: Projected relative differences in pluvial flooding (PF) for 25-year and 100-year
    return periods. Mean change ratios for 2006-2053 are 9.14% and 10.79% respectively
    and for 2054-2100 are 14.80% and 16.90%. LOCA model mean change ratios for 2006-2053
    are 8.26% and 9.99% respectively and for 2054-2100 are 12.19% and 13.12%.
  13: Under the RCP4.5 scenario for the first half of the 21st century, UWPD data
    shows a mean relative ratio increase of 0.09 (9%) for PF estimates with a 25-year
    return period. Change ranges from 0%-5% in New Jersey and southeast New York,
    to 20%-30% north of Maine.
  16: "Under the RCP8.5 scenario, the exceedance probability for the 100-year event\
    \ (0.01) will increase to \u22480.04 for the second half of the 21st century"
  17: Projected changes in return periods for extreme precipitation events (e.g.,
    100-year event) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for two future time periods
    (2006-2053 and 2054-2100) in the Northeastern US, as well as associated exceedance
    probabilities. The results are broken down by the UWPD and LOCA data sets.
