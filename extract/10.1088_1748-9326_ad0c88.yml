Drivers of Risk:
  1: Human influence on regional sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the North Pacific.
  2: Increasing human influence on regional temperatures/SST is identified as a driver
    of risk, particularly in relation to declining fish stocks.
  4: Ocean warming, specifically three-year running mean SST.
  5: Human-induced climate change impacting sea surface temperatures.
  6: Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies; anthropogenic influence.
  7: Increases in SST, particularly three-year mean SST values, related to anthropogenic
    warming are driving changes in risk ratios for SST across various regions.
  8: The primary driver of risk is increasing sea surface temperature (SST), particularly
    warming attributed to anthropogenic influences. The fraction of attributable risk
    (FAR) is used to quantify the human influence on temperature.
  9: Increased sea surface temperatures (SST) due to anthropogenic forcing are impacting
    the outcomes for the sockeye salmon fishery.
  10: Estimated warming of the entire North Pacific expected for the 15 year window
    centered on the year of interest (i.e. the year of the observed ERSST anomaly
    for which we are evaluating probability).
  11: SST (Sea Surface Temperature) changes are a driver of risk, with a focus on
    trends.
  12: SST (Sea Surface Temperature) is used as a driver impacting sockeye salmon catches.
  13: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is a driver of risk affecting Gulf of Alaska fish
    stocks. High FAR values impact catch.

Highlights:
  1: "Human influence on regional ocean temperatures could first be detected in the\
    \ 1970s and grew until 2014\u20132020 temperatures showed overwhelming evidence\
    \ of human contribution. For the entire North Pacific, temperatures have reached\
    \ levels that were likely impossible in the preindustrial climate. Strongest evidence\
    \ for human influence is in the northernmost ecosystems (Eastern Bering Sea and\
    \ Gulf of Alaska)."
  2: The study aims to document the evolution of human influence on North Pacific
    and regional SST, evaluate changes in the expected return time for extreme SST
    events, and demonstrate the potential of attribution statistics for contextualizing
    climate change and informing adaptation decision-making by comparing outcomes
    for fisheries catch under different degrees of human influence.
  4: North Pacific SST has effectively become fixed in an anthropogenic state. All
    five regions, plus the overall North Pacific, have reached temperatures that can
    be attributed to human activities with high confidence (i.e. FAR > 0.98).
  5: FAR estimates show a north-south gradient, with the two northernmost ecosystems
    (Eastern Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska) having FAR > 0.5 for three-year running mean
    SST in every year since 1984 (Eastern Bering Sea), indicating anomalies twice
    as likely due to human influence.
  6: The strongest evidence for anthropogenic influence is seen in the northernmost
    region (Eastern Bering Sea); There are important regional differences that provide
    context for observed SST extremes in the different ecosystems; Declines in sockeye
    harvests can also be statistically related to the increasing evidence for human
    influence on Gulf of Alaska climate.
  7: Critical SST thresholds rarely exceeded in historical climates are now common
    in the current climate and are expected to become cooler-than-normal conditions
    under future warming scenarios.
  8: The proportion of risk to the sockeye salmon fishery that can be ascribed to
    human activities has grown from detectable to overwhelming. The analysis shows
    the increasing human influence on North Pacific climate and its impact on the
    sockeye salmon fishery.
  9: There is an increasing risk of deleterious temperature events, making historic
    temperature conditions less frequent and impacting the fisheries, and a diverse
    fisheries participation portfolio may be more effective for adaptation.
  10: CMIP6 model outputs for calculating FAR and RR values were weighted with an
    approach that rewards model skill and independence.
  11: "Model weighting is highly dependent on \u03C3D. A value of \u03C3S = 0.4 was\
    \ adopted for all regions. Skill weight has a stronger effect than independence\
    \ weight. The trend in anomalies during 1973\u20132022 was used to weight models\
    \ for estimating the timing of North Pacific warming thresholds under SSP2-4.5\
    \ and SSP5-8.5."
  12: "Independence skill has a greater influence on model weights than observed in\
    \ the model weights used throughout the study when using \u03C3S = 0.4 and \u03C3\
    D = 0.82."
  13: "The SST projections for various Pacific regions indicate a warming trend throughout\
    \ the 21st century. The study investigates the optimal \u03C3D for weighting CMIP6\
    \ models to accurately hindcast and project North Pacific warming rates."
  14: The Skill and Independence weights start higher and decrease over time, while
    the Combined weight remains consistently lower.
Methodology:
  1: Climate attribution techniques (Bayesian estimates of Fraction of Attributable
    Risk (FAR) and Risk Ratio (RR)) applied to sea surface temperature time series
    from five regional North Pacific ecosystems (1950-2022) using 23 global climate
    models.
  2: "The study applies EEA techniques to time series of sea surface temperature (SST)\
    \ observations from 1950\u20132022. It calculates FAR and RR from individual ensemble\
    \ members for 23 CMIP6 models, using normalized SST anomalies relative to the\
    \ pre-1950 time series. Preindustrial and present-day probabilities are estimated\
    \ for each CMIP6 model. The study also considers both annual and three-year running\
    \ mean values of SST. Model weighting is used to reward model skill and independence."
  4: "Bayesian regression models are used to relate catch to SST and FAR values to\
    \ SST. CMIP6 historical/SSP5-8.5 runs are used to derive probability density functions\
    \ for SST relative to a sockeye salmon critical threshold. Analysis limited to\
    \ catch years 1989-2022. Timing of 0.5 \u25E6C warming increments for the North\
    \ Pacific was estimated for observations using a Bayesian smoothed regression\
    \ fitting year to warming relative to 1854\u20131949."
  5: "CMIP6 values are weighted multi-model mean values \xB1 2 weighted standard deviations.\
    \ Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) is estimated for annual and three-year running\
    \ mean SST with 95% credible intervals, 1950-2022."
  6: Bayesian posteriors with 95% credible intervals to determine when FAR values
    for SST observations at two temporal scales (annual and three-year running mean)
    could not be distinguished from zero; Regression of sockeye salmon catches on
    SST and FAR values.
  8: The analysis uses Bayesian regression to model the relationship between SST,
    FAR, and log commercial catch anomalies. The study employs a time series analysis
    dating back to the 1970s/1980s. Fraction of Attributable Risk is calculated and
    related to temperatures.
  9: The analysis uses attribution of 'system-breaking' climate change events and
    links these events with fishery performance, using SST and FAR as explanatory
    variables.
  10: 'A Bayesian smoothed regression was used to isolate the warming signal from
    high-frequency noise in observed and CMIP6 model-derived North Pacific SST time
    series (1950-2022). Model weighting was based on skill and independence for bias
    in climatology, and variability, autocorrelation, and the trend in SST. '
  11: "Model weights are calculated based on bias, trend, standard deviation, and\
    \ autocorrelation in SST. A 'perfect model' setup is used to tune shape parameters\
    \ \u03C3D and \u03C3S, aiming for 80% of 'true' model values to fall between the\
    \ 10th and 90th quantiles of weighted prediction. Trend weighting during 1973\u2013\
    2022 uses the root mean square error for linear regression of observed anomalies\
    \ on modeled anomalies."
  12: A weighted average of SST values across the range of ocean entry years is used
    to calculate a single SST value for each catch year, using the mean proportion
    of sockeye entering the ocean in a particular year as weights.
  13: "The paper uses CMIP6 models and a perfect model setup for selecting shape parameters\
    \ (\u03C3D) to weight the models. Continuous regressions of catch on SST and FAR\
    \ are performed, including year as a covariate. Weakly informative priors are\
    \ used for all model parameters, including Student-t and normal distributions\
    \ for different parameters."
  14: The paper involves weighting models based on Skill, Independence, and Combined
    criteria for North Pacific warming hindcasts and projections.
More Notes:
  1: Attribution time series may be helpful indicators for better defining the human
    role in observed climate change impacts and may help researchers, managers, and
    stakeholders to better understand and plan for the effects of climate change.
  5: The study suggests unprecedented climate perturbations to northeast Pacific ecosystems
    that are consistent with Arctic amplification of global warming. The trend and
    pattern in reaching high levels of attributable risk varied among regions.
  6: Table 2 shows the final year in each region during which FAR values for SST observations
    at two temporal scales (annual and three-year running mean) could not be distinguished
    from zero.
  8: "The paper highlights the \u2018shifting baseline\u2019 syndrome, where the gradual\
    \ increase in human influence on North Pacific climate may be difficult for humans\
    \ to recognize, presenting an adaptation challenge."
  10: The study uses fisheries data that are routinely collected for fisheries management
    purposes.
  11: "The analysis focuses on weighting CMIP6 models based on their performance relative\
    \ to observations. The selection of shape parameters (\u03C3D, \u03C3S) is crucial\
    \ for model weighting. The study covers the North Pacific basin and five subregions\
    \ (Eastern Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, British Columbia Coast, Northern California\
    \ Current, and Southern California Current)."
  12: The South Alaska Peninsula was excluded from analysis because the majority of
    sockeye salmon harvests are for fish returning to Bering Sea natal streams.
  13: Model weights are normalized and combined, indicated by line color in the SST
    projections, with different colors representing varying levels of confidence in
    the models. The study analyzes the impact of SST and FAR on Gulf of Alaska fish
    stocks using both continuous and categorical models.

    model numbers, highlighting the dynamics of model evaluation.
Quantitative material:
  1: FAR > 0.98 for at least one year in all regions; extreme regional SST values
    expected every 1000-10000 years in the preindustrial climate are expected every
    5-40 years in the current climate; sockeye salmon migrating to sea in years with
    FAR >= 0.98 produce catches 1.4 standard deviations below the long-term log mean.
  2: The study calculates Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) and Risk Ratio (RR)
    values for SST anomalies in the North Pacific and regional ecosystems.
  4: "Average ex-vessel value of $64.4M USD during the last decade for the Gulf of\
    \ Alaska sockeye salmon fishery. FAR > 0.98 indicates strong evidence for anthropogenic\
    \ impacts. FAR \u2A7E 0.99 for three-year running mean North Pacific SST since\
    \ 2003, and for annual SST since 2013."
  5: Modeled and observed temperature change (sea surface temperature anomalies in
    degrees Celsius) relative to the pre-1950 mean for three CMIP6 runs (Historical,
    SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5) and ERSSTv5 observations.
  6: "Eastern Bering Sea exceeded FAR values of 0.99 for three-year running mean SST\
    \ as early as 2003/2004; Annual SST FAR values for this system also exceeded 0.99\
    \ for each year from 2014 through 2020; Gulf of Alaska and British Columbia Coast\
    \ exceeded 0.98 for at least two years since 2015; anomalies in the Eastern Bering\
    \ Sea of 5.08 SD should be expected every \u223C 40 years; anomalies in the Gulf\
    \ of Alaska of 2.98 SD are expected every \u223C 5 years; projected dates for\
    \ SSP2-4.5 of 2039 and 2060 for 1.5 \u25E6C and 2.0 \u25E6C, respectively; and\
    \ 2032 and 2044, respectively, for SSP5-8.5; decline of 1.4SD in ln(catch) for\
    \ high-FAR years (FAR\u2A7E 0.98), corresponds to a 39% decline in raw catch relative"
  7: The page presents expected return times for warmest observed SST events, varying
    from 10^0 to 10^8 years at different climate states, as well as probabilities
    for exceeding critical SST thresholds under different warming levels.
  8: The paper presents relationships between three-year running mean SST and log
    commercial catch anomalies. It also presents the relationship between Fraction
    of Attributable Risk values and log commercial catch anomalies. It provides posterior
    distributions of fishery production for fish experiencing different levels of
    anthropogenic temperature effects (FAR <= 0.91 and FAR >= 0.98).  A specific SST
    value of 2.08 (value for 2017) is identified above which negative effects of SST
    on sockeye catch have been observed.
  9: "Evidence showing that a 1.4 standard deviation (SD) decline in log-transformed\
    \ sockeye salmon catch corresponds to temperatures with fractional attributable\
    \ risk (FAR) \u2265 0.98."
  10: "The probability of a given anomaly for \u2018present\u2019 conditions was then\
    \ calculated as the proportion of anomalies equal to or greater than the observed\
    \ anomaly within the relevant span of North Pacific warming that corresponded\
    \ with the 15 year window centered on the observation year."
  11: "Values of \u03C3D varied between 1.16 and 1.84 for the different regions. Southern\
    \ California Current reached 79.3% of 'true' values falling between the 10th and\
    \ 90th quantiles."
  12: "Model weights are calculated using shape parameters \u03C3S = 0.4 and \u03C3\
    D = 0.82."
  13: "The paper presents SST projections for various regions (North Pacific, Eastern\
    \ Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, British Columbia Coast, Northern California Current,\
    \ Southern California Current) until 2100 using CMIP6 models. Also provides the\
    \ proportion of \"true\" values falling between the 10th and 90th quantiles of\
    \ weighted prediction for different values of \u03C3D."
