Drivers of Risk:
  1: Human-induced ocean warming; specifically, increasing sea surface temperatures
    (SSTs) in the North Pacific due to anthropogenic climate change.
  4: Ocean warming (SST) in the North Pacific impacting sockeye salmon productivity,
    with a focus on anthropogenic climate change.
  8: Anthropogenic warming, measured via sea surface temperature (SST) and Fraction
    of Attributable Risk (FAR), is identified as a key driver impacting fishery production.
  9: Anthropogenic forcing leading to increased North Pacific temperatures and extreme
    SST anomalies; changes in at-sea distribution of sockeye salmon due to warming.
  12: Changes in sea surface temperature (SST) affecting sockeye salmon populations.
  13: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and FAR are drivers impacting salmon stock returns.
Highlights:
  1: "Human influence on regional ocean temperatures could first be detected in the\
    \ 1970s and grew until 2014\u20132020 temperatures showed overwhelming evidence\
    \ of human contribution. The Gulf of Alaska sockeye salmon fishery example demonstrates\
    \ how attribution time series can be used to contextualize the impacts of human-induced\
    \ ocean warming on ecosystem services."
  4: North Pacific SST has effectively become fixed in an anthropogenic state (FAR
    >= 0.99) since 2003 (three-year running mean) and 2013 (annual SST). The authors
    evaluated changing climate risk for the fishery by calculating probability density
    functions for three-year running mean Gulf of Alaska SST relative to an identified
    sockeye salmon critical threshold.
  8: The proportion of risk to the fishery that can be ascribed to human activities
    has grown from detectable to overwhelming. Recent temperatures for the entire
    North Pacific have reached levels that have negative effects on sockeye catch.
  9: Human influence on climate risk is illustrated by the rapid decline in expected
    return times for extreme SST anomalies, leading to an increased risk of fisheries
    failure; attribution statistics may support stakeholders in discounting past experience
    when evaluating current climate risk.
  12: The study calculates model weights based on skill and independence, influencing
    the impact of independence skill more than the used model weights. Sockeye salmon
    catch analysis is performed using historical data and weighted average SST calculations.
  13: SST and FAR influence adult salmon return rates, and the models are weighted
    to provide more accurate hindcasts and projections.
Methodology:
  1: Climate attribution techniques (Bayesian estimates of Fraction of Attributable
    Risk (FAR) and Risk Ratio (RR) derived from 23 global climate models) are applied
    to sea surface temperature time series from five regional North Pacific ecosystems
    (1950-2022).
  4: "Bayesian regression models are used to relate catch to SST and FAR values. CMIP6\
    \ model outputs are used to estimate probabilities of extreme SST events under\
    \ different warming scenarios. Analysis is limited to catch years 1989\u20132022\
    \ to avoid non-stationary SST-salmon relationships. Stan 2.21.0 and R 4.1.2 are\
    \ used for Bayesian modeling."
  8: Bayesian regression is used to model the relationship between SST/FAR and log
    commercial catch anomalies. The analysis uses a time series of data and examines
    the evolution of human influence on North Pacific climate. The study attributes
    post-2014 marine heatwaves in the North Pacific to human influence.
  9: Uses a 'system-breaking' climate change event (the 1.4 SD decline) and the fraction
    of attributable risk (FAR) as an explanatory variable in an ecosystem services
    model, rather than SST or a heatwave index.
  12: The study analyzes historical commercial harvests of sockeye salmon in five
    Alaskan management areas, relating catch data to SST using a weighted average
    of SST values across ocean entry years. It appears to use climate model outputs
    (CMIP6) and apply model weighting techniques based on skill and independence,
    visualized in figures A2 and A3.
  13: Continuous regressions of catch on SST and FAR, with year as a covariate. Categorical
    model of the response of catch to high FAR values. Weakly informative priors used
    for all model parameters, including Student-t and normal distributions for various
    parameters.
More Notes:
  1: Attribution time series may be helpful indicators for better defining the human
    role in observed climate change impacts, and may thus help researchers, managers,
    and stakeholders to better understand and plan for the effects of climate change
    and adaptation planning. Focuses on extreme event attribution (EEA).
  8: The paper uses the 'shifting baseline' syndrome as a challenge to adaptation
    and highlights a persistent trend of increasing human influence on the North Pacific
    climate.
  9: The study focuses on a specific case study (sockeye salmon fishery in the North
    Pacific) and acknowledges limitations of global climate models for regional-scale
    analysis. Uncertainty exists regarding the influence of atmosphere-ocean circulation
    and the potential for novel states poorly represented in models.
  12: The analysis excludes the South Alaska Peninsula due to the majority of its
    sockeye salmon harvests relating to Bering Sea natal streams. The study considers
    ocean entry proportions derived from age-structured data.
  13: FAR is not defined in this excerpt, but seems to be a relevant environmental
    variable. The study focuses on Gulf of Alaska salmon stocks. The analysis includes
    projections until 2100 using CMIP6 models under the SSP5-8.5 scenario for SST.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Impacts on ecosystem services, specifically focusing on sockeye salmon fisheries
    as an example of climate change impacts on national economies.
  4: Gulf of Alaska commercial sockeye salmon fishery ex-vessel value.
  8: Fishery production (log catch anomaly) is used as a proxy for economic outcome
    related to the Gulf of Alaska sockeye salmon commercial fishery.
  9: Decline in rewards for participating in the sockeye fishery.
  12: None
  13: Adult return data (of salmon stocks) is correlated to sea surface temperature
    (SST) and FAR (unspecified).
Quantitative material:
  1: "Sockeye salmon catches are 1.4 standard deviations below the long-term log mean\
    \ when migrating to sea in years with the strongest evidence for human effects\
    \ on temperature (FAR \u2265 0.98)."
  4: "Average ex-vessel value of the Gulf of Alaska sockeye salmon fishery is $64.4M\
    \ USD during the last decade.  FAR > 0.98 for at least part of the 2014\u2013\
    2019 marine."
  8: Panels A and B show relationships between SST/FAR and log commercial catch anomalies
    with regression lines and credible intervals. Panel C provides full posterior
    distributions of fishery production under different FAR thresholds (<= 0.91 and
    >= 0.98). Panel D shows probability densities for SST values at different levels
    of North Pacific warming.
  9: "1.4 SD decline in log-transformed sockeye salmon catch at temperatures corresponding\
    \ to FAR\u2A7E 0.98; deleterious temperatures should be expected as often as not\
    \ in the current climate."
  12: The study uses a weighted average of SST values across the range of ocean entry
    years for sockeye salmon to calculate a single SST value for each catch year.
    Model weights for CMIP6 models are calculated and displayed in figures.
  13: Observed SST plotted against historical/SSP5-8.5 runs for 23 CMIP6 models, and
    a perfect model setup to select the shape parameters for weighting CMIP6 models
    to hindcast and project North Pacific warming rate.
