Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change will dramatically slow and redistribute global growth.
  2: "Temperature changes impacting productivity, with peak productivity at 13\xB0\
    C average annual temperature."
  3: Climate change effects on key ICT goods exporters like USA and China can impact
    global ICT activity.
  4: Temperature effects of climate change
  5: Indirect global effects of climate change (e.g., wars, famines) could be so dramatic
    that significant reductions in sociotechnical complexity may have led to a great
    degree of deglobalization.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change is likely to dramatically slow the global economic growth rate
    in coming decades and change the distribution of growth among countries; this
    may impact future information systems and digital innovation.
  2: Climate change is projected to significantly reduce global incomes and redistribute
    growth across nations, with many countries near the equator experiencing negative
    growth by 2099.
  3: China is projected to remain a top ICT goods exporter, with the Netherlands emerging
    as a significant exporter by 2099.
  4: Northern and Eastern Europe are well positioned to grow in future ICT goods exporting,
    as South and Southeast Asian economies see their role reduced substantially from
    changing climates.
  5: The prospect of profoundly reduced economic growth carries with it reduced innovation,
    so the rate of change in ICT systems may begin to slow.
Methodology:
  1: Quantitative analyses to project the effects of climate-change-adjusted economic
    futures on information systems across different countries.
  2: Analysis based on data from Burke et al. (2015) relating temperature and economic
    activity, with additional analyses performed by the authors.
  3: The analysis uses World Bank data and GDP projections by Burke et al. to examine
    future dominance in ICT exporting by 2099.
  4: The analysis projects the impact of climate change (temperature effects only)
    on future GDP per capita and ICT exports for various countries, comparing current
    and projected future rankings.
  5: The analysis considers the impact of decreased and redistributed global growth
    on information systems and innovation, considering a long-term perspective.
More Notes:
  1: The paper explores how decreased and redistributed growth may impact future information
    systems and digital innovation.
  2: Observed warming from 1960-2010 apparently did not induce notable adaptation.
  3: Numerous unpredictable factors, like geopolitical events or R&D investment declines
    during recessions, may affect future ICT export rankings.
  4: The analysis only considers temperature effects of climate change, not other
    aspects such as sea level rise, and references the 2011 Thailand flooding as an
    example of climate-related risk.
  5: The paper suggests a need for new research streams departing from traditional
    theory of innovation, focusing on resource-constrained environments and negative
    adoption progressions.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  2: Average global incomes in 2100 will be 23% lower than they would have been without
    climate change.
  4: GDP per capita, GDP growth rate, International Trade
  5: Reduction in global growth is likely to have overarching effects on ICT systems.
Quantitative material:
  1: No relevant information
  2: Average global incomes in 2100 will be 23% lower than they would have been without
    climate change; By the end of the century, 77% of countries will have their per
    capita income reduced; 104 of 165 countries projected to experience negative annual
    growth by 2099; 113 countries are projected to be below +0.5% annual growth by
    2099; 65 countries will be contracting at a rate of 1.5%/year or greater by 2099.
  3: Current and projected figures of ICT goods and service exports provided; e.g.,
    China's ICT goods exports projected to be $4.4T by 2099.
  4: "Vietnam\u2019s growth rate peaks at 6.3% in 2015, and turns negative in 2067.\
    \ Malaysia peaks at 3.6% in 2025 and turns negative in 2059. The Philippines peaks\
    \ at 5.0% in 2030, and turns negative in 2075. China\u2019s growth rate is 8.4%\
    \ in 2011, and decreases every year thereafter, finally turning negative in 2096."
  5: Dramatic decrease in GDP growth predicted by Burke et al. [[11]] could also have
    significant implications for innovation more broadly.
