Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (increasing temperatures, more frequent/intense/longer heat events),
    socio-economic pathways (economic growth)
  2: The drivers of risk are four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and
    five socio-economic pathways (SSPs), combined into RCP/SSP combinations, representing
    different climate futures and socio-economic developments.
  6: The paper analyzes the impact of two different climate change scenarios (RCP2.6/SSP1
    and RCP8.5/SSP5) on exposure to extreme drought (EXD) and mean annual growing
    degree days (MAG).
  7: Changes in heat exposure frequency (EXD) and magnitude (MAG) in major cities
    worldwide due to climate change, influenced by different Representative Concentration
    Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).
  8: The drivers of risk are different climate change scenarios (RCP2.6/SSP1 and RCP8.5/SSP5)
    which represent different future climate trajectories and socio-economic pathways,
    driving changes in heat exposure.
  9: Heat exposure changes driven by different RCP and SSP scenarios, specifically
    RCP8.5/SSP5 versus RCP2.6/SSP1, impacting urban adaptation and mortality.
  10: Climate change (specifically heat exposure), socioeconomic development (specifically
    SSPs and RCPs), fossil-fuel exploitation
  11: The study considers climate variables (daily mean temperature, daily mean humidity,
    and wind speed) and socio-economic variables as drivers impacting the estimation
    of MMTs.
  12: Increase in daily mean apparent temperature (ATmean) exceeding the MMT (measure
    for human heat adaptation in cities).
Highlights:
  1: "Human adaptation to heat, driven by acclimatization and economic development,\
    \ can broadly keep the negative health effects of global warming in check, but\
    \ this is contingent on the climate scenario and location. High economic growth\
    \ is needed to maintain MMT increases under high-forcing climate scenarios (RCP8.5).\
    \ A 2\xB0C-compatible climate trajectory alleviates the dependence on fast growth."
  2: Increasing forcing levels (higher RCPs) lead to higher adaptation rates (increased
    MMT) but also amplify heat exposure frequency and magnitude.
  6: Significant disparities in future exposure are highlighted between the two climate
    change scenarios. In a fossil-fuel dependent future (RCP8.5/SSP5), some cities
    face significantly increased exposure to EXD and MAG, while a sustainable scenario
    (RCP2.6/SSP1) could lead to reductions in exposure for the same cities.
  7: RCP8.5/SSP5 leads to significantly more cities experiencing increased heat exposure
    compared to RCP2.6/SSP1. Higher adaptation can be achieved by RCP8.5/SSP5 compared
    to RCP2.6/SSP5, but a future according to RCP2.6/SSP1 is able to minimize heat
    exposure for the city sample.
  8: The study assesses future adaptation and heat exposure jointly for 3820 cities
    worldwide. It contrasts two options of socio-economic development that facilitate
    adaptation, aiming to identify the least unfavorable choice for human health outcomes.
    It quantifies changes in heat exposure across cities under different climate scenarios.
  9: RCP2.6/SSP1 scenarios reduce heat exposure and provide moderate adaptation levels
    without increasing climate change, whereas RCP8.5/SSP5 could critically endanger
    cities in arid and semi-arid climates due to increased heat exposure.
  10: Sustainable economic growth contributes to adaptation and maintains low forcing,
    benefitting cities in western Europe, North America, and Central and Eastern Asia.
    Strong socioeconomic development based on fossil-fuel exploitation amplifies extreme
    heat exposures. The paper introduces a new method to determine the future HMR
    by addressing the uncertainty in delta values. The study emphasizes the importance
    of considering both heat adaptation and exposure jointly.
  11: The re-calibrated model preserves the relative importance of variables for MMT
    estimation, indicating a reliable adaptation of the model to gridded climate data.
  12: This paper focuses on the exceedance of human heat adaptation thresholds in
    cities under different climate change scenarios.
Methodology:
  1: The study models long-term changes in minimum mortality temperatures (MMT) as
    a function of climate change and socio-economic progress across 3820 cities.
  2: The analysis combines RCPs and SSPs and uses Global Circulation Models (GCMs)
    to project MMT, EXD, and MAG from 2000 to 2100 across 3820 cities worldwide.
  6: The analysis uses RCP2.6/SSP1 and RCP8.5/SSP5 climate scenarios to project changes
    in EXD and MAG for major world cities until 2100. It uses a specific version of
    the R software package for creating maps (version 3.6.2 with the tmap package
    version 2.3-2).
  7: Analysis of heat exposure parameters (EXD and MAG) in 3820 cities under different
    climate change scenarios (RCP2.6/SSP1 and RCP8.5/SSP5) until 2100. Adaptation
    and exposure parameters are aggregated and outcomes (P05, P95, Mean, Min and Max)
    are provided. The map in Figure 5 was created in R using the tmap package.
  8: "The analysis assesses future adaptation and heat exposure for 3820 cities worldwide\
    \ until 2100 under different climate scenarios (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5) and\
    \ socio-economic pathways (SSPs 1\u20135)."
  9: Analysis of heat exposure and adaptation in 3820 cities across various RCPs and
    SSPs, focusing on the impact of climate trajectories and socio-economic pathways.
  10: The study uses climate data from CMIP5 and ISIMIP for four GCMs (GFDL_ESM2M,
    HadGEM2_ES, IPSL_CM5A-LR, MIROC5) under different RCPs (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5)
    and SSPs. It analyzes the changes in heat exposure frequency and magnitude to
    approximate changes in heat-related mortality until 2100. The study assumes instantaneous
    adaptation, focusing on ensemble means, and acknowledges uncertainty from SSPs.
  11: The study includes a calibration process using a non-linear-least-squares fit
    based on 400 cities across different climate zones and world regions.
  12: "The paper calculates the annual number of days that show a daily mean apparent\
    \ temperature (ATmean) exceeding the MMT (measure for human heat adaptation in\
    \ cities) for the historic exposure reference period 1991\u20132000 and the future\
    \ exposure period 2090\u20132099 under each of the four RCPs."
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on heat-related mortality risk and uses MMT as an indicator
    of adaptation. The MMT reflects both physiological acclimatization and socio-economic
    factors.
  2: The paper's focus is on urban health outcomes, and specifically heat-related
    mortality, under different climate change scenarios. It determines the lesser
    of two evils regarding the change in mortality against an ideal future in absence
    of climate change and heat exposure.
  6: The paper focuses on city-level changes in environmental variables, not directly
    on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes at a national level. While the environmental
    changes undoubtedly impact economic activity, the paper does not provide a direct
    link between the environmental changes and the impact on macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes at a national level.
  7: The paper emphasizes the importance of considering adaptation and exposure jointly.
    High increases in heat exposure often coincide with small adaptation efforts in
    certain regions, potentially leading to increased mortality. Wealth-driven adaptation
    is assumed, but the impact can be annihilated under high forcing scenarios like
    RCP8.5/SSP5.
  8: The paper aims to identify the least unfavorable choice for human health outcomes
    given potential adaptation, acknowledging that all options constitute an impairment
    relative to a no climate change scenario. The analysis focuses on the number of
    cities affected by changes in heat exposure, not directly on aggregate national-level
    macroeconomic impacts.
  9: The paper emphasizes the importance of sustainable socio-economic growth in achieving
    heat adaptation without exacerbating climate change.
  10: The study acknowledges limitations, including the assumption of instantaneous
    adaptation and no changes in health conditions or heat-related mortality until
    2100. The study uses 30-year means ending in 2094 to account for lags in acclimatization.
  12: MMTs (Mean MMT and delta MMT) are valid for the years around the prediction
    years 2000 and 2100. All calculations have been performed in R (version 3.6.2),
    and maps have been produced with the tmap package (version 2.3-2).

Quantitative material:
  1: The risk to human health is expected to decline in 60% to 80% of cities against
    contemporary conditions by 2100.
  2: The paper provides quantitative information on changes in MMT (Maximum Mortality
    Temperature) in degrees Celsius, frequency of heat exposure (EXD) as number of
    days, and magnitude of heat exposure (MAG) in degrees Celsius.
  6: "The paper provides quantitative estimates of changes in EXD and MAG under different\
    \ climate scenarios for various cities. For example, it mentions that in RCP8.5/SSP5,\
    \ some cities will have to cope with 50 to 92 additional EXD until 2090\u2013\
    2099, while in RCP2.6/SSP1 EXD could be reduced by 50 EXD."
  7: Under RCP8.5/SSP5, 1150 (30%) cities will experience additional EXD and 1459
    (38%) a larger MAG. 705 (18%) cities will face more than one fourth of the year
    being EXD and 185 (5%) cities half the year being EXD. Five cities are projected
    to have almost the entire year as EXD (>350 EXD). Under RCP2.6/SSP1, 224 (6%)
    cities will face additional EXD and 338 (9%) a higher MAG. 3207 (84%) cities will
    profit from less EXD and 3074 (80%) from a lower MAG. No changes in EXD or MAG
    will affect 389 (10%) and 408 (11%) cities, respectively.
  8: The table provides quantitative data on the number and percentage of 3820 world
    cities affected by changes in heat exposure under different climate scenarios.
    For example, under RCP2.6/SSP1, 3207 cities see a reduction in days of heat exposure,
    while under RCP8.5/SSP5, this number is 2285.
  9: No specific quantitative information on the macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes
    of interest is provided.
  10: 'The paper proposes a functional relationship as a proxy for change in future
    heat-related mortality: /Delta1MORT = f(/Delta1EXD, /Delta1MAG). This is used
    to calculate a slope m = /Delta1MMT//Delta1MORT to quantify the change in heat-related
    mortality.'
  12: The analysis resulted in 15 datasets, one for each RCP/SSP setting, covering
    3,820 city-specific mean EXD values (mean number of exposure days). Also, 15 datasets
    containing the /Delta1MAG (delta change in mean exceedance magnitude) for 3820
    cities.
