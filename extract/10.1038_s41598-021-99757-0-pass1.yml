Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in climate trajectories and socio-economic progress impacting future
    heat-related mortality and health risks.
  2: Changes in daily temperature, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), and
    Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs).
  4: The study considers changes in climate (e.g., temperature) and GDP/capita as
    drivers of risk.
  6: The main drivers of risk are changes in climate variables leading to increases
    in exposure days (EXD) and the magnitude of climate change (MAG), specifically
    related to temperature.
  7: Heat exposure frequency (EXD), magnitude of heat exposure (MAG), summer temperatures.
  8: Shocks include changes in future heat exposure, influenced by different RCP/SSP
    scenarios.
  9: The primary drivers of risk are climate change (represented by RCP scenarios)
    and socio-economic pathways (represented by SSP scenarios), which influence heat
    exposure.
  10: The primary drivers of risk are future temperature, humidity, and socio-economic
    factors represented by Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative
    Concentration Pathways (RCPs).
  11: The primary drivers of risk are daily mean temperature (tas) and daily mean
    humidity (hurs), which are used to calculate apparent temperature (AT), as well
    as daily mean wind speed (sfcWind) for temperature corrections. Socioeconomic
    factor GDP/capita is also used.
  12: The primary driver of risk is daily mean apparent temperature (ATmean) exceeding
    the city-specific MMT, under various RCP/SSP climate change scenarios.

Highlights:
  1: "RCP8.5 scenario requires uninterrupted high economic growth by 2100 to mitigate\
    \ health effects, whereas a 2\xB0C-compatible trajectory does not depend heavily\
    \ on fast economic growth."
  2: Adaptation and exposure changes are diverse, especially under RCP8.5/SSP5 conditions.
    Higher forcing levels generally lead to higher adaptation and adaptation rates,
    but also amplify heat exposure frequency and magnitude.
  4: A large projected GDP/capita does not automatically lead to a better bearable
    situation regarding future heat and related mortality for urban populations. Adaptation
    gains are solely driven by GDP/capita changes in Western Europe, North America,
    East Asia, Oceania and coastal South America.
  6: "In a fossil-fuel dependent future (RCP8.5/SSP5), some cities may have to cope\
    \ with 50 to 92 additional EXD until 2090\u20132099. Cities in the Sahel, the\
    \ Middle East into Pakistan and India, in northern and southern Africa, in the\
    \ Southwestern USA and in northern Mexico show high increments in /Delta1MAG (+\
    \ 2 C to +6 C) until 2090\u20132099 under the RCP8.5/SSP5 scenario. The paper\
    \ highlights disparities in future exposure between different climate scenarios\
    \ (RCP2.6/SSP1 vs. RCP8.5/SSP5). In RCP8.5/SSP5, a total of 2285 (60%) cities\
    \ in their sample will profit from an EXD reduction"
  7: Lower forcing (RCP2.6/SSP1) yields a larger reducing effect on heat exposure
    parameters for more cities. Higher adaptation can be achieved by RCP8.5/SSP5 compared
    to RCP2.6/SSP1. High increases in heat exposure coincide with small adaptation
    increments in the Middle East, Pakistan, parts of the USA, and northern Mexico.
  8: Under RCP2.6/SSP1, 3207 cities will see reduced EXD days, while under RCP8.5/SSP5,
    2285 cities will see a reduction; under RCP2.6/SSP1, 3074 cities experience reduced
    MAG, and 1968 cities under RCP8.5/SSP5.
  9: "Minimum forcing RCP2.6 reduces heat exposure in the majority of cities until\
    \ the future decade (2090\u20132099), while a stable and sustainable socio-economic\
    \ pathway SSP1 will equip most world cities with a moderately high adaptation.\
    \ A rapid socio-economic growth based on fossil fuels along with high forcing\
    \ (RCP8.5/SSP5) will reach higher adaptation levels in 2100 for most cities against\
    \ a sustainable future, though, fewer cities will profit from decreases in heat\
    \ exposure. A future according to RCP8.5/SSP5 would critically endanger cities\
    \ in arid and semi-arid climates."
  10: The study highlights the importance of considering socio-economic factors in
    assessing future adaptation to heat. It also proposes a method to determine the
    future HMR's slope based on changes in heat exposure frequency and magnitude.
    A sustainable pathway avoids exposure for most cities endangered in a RCP8.5/SSP5
    future.
  11: The re-calibrated model using gridded climate data preserves the relative importance
    of independent variables as in a previous study.
  12: The study determines the delta change in MMTs between the end and the beginning
    of the century, the delta changes in EXD, and the delta change in mean MAG for
    each city by subtracting the city-specific decadal mean.

Methodology:
  1: The analysis involves modeling MMT as a function of climate change and socio-economic
    progress across 3820 cities, assuming shifts in temperature-mortality curves.
  2: Combines four RCPs from Global Circulation Models (GCMs) with five SSPs. Uses
    the Scenario Matrix. Assesses changes in adaptation to heat for 3820 cities worldwide
    from 2000 to 2100.
  4: "The analysis uses RCP/SSP combinations to project future conditions and calculates\
    \ changes in climate variables, GDP/capita, \u0394EXD, and \u0394MMT across cities.\
    \ The study identifies the primary contributors to \u0394MMT, comparing the weighted\
    \ influence of single variables versus the sum of other variables. Results are\
    \ applicable for the period 2000-2100."
  6: The analysis projects changes until 2090-2099 under different scenarios (RCP2.6/SSP1
    and RCP8.5/SSP5) and calculates the change in exposure days (/Delta1EXD) and magnitude
    of change in climate (/Delta1MAG). The map was created in R using the tmap package.
  7: Analysis uses RCP2.6/SSP1 and RCP8.5/SSP5 scenarios to project changes in heat
    exposure frequency in 3,820 major cities worldwide until 2100 (specifically, comparing
    1991-2000 to 2090-2099). Adaptation is also incorporated. The map in Figure 5
    was created using R (version 3.6.2) and the tmap package (version 2.3-2).
  8: Assessment of heat exposure and adaptation uses climate scenarios RCP2.6/SSP1
    and RCP8.5/SSP5, impacting cities worldwide until 2100.
  9: "The approach presented here takes stock of urban populations\u2019 adaptation\
    \ and exposure to heat in 3820 cities across the globe for the full spectrum of\
    \ climate trajectories and socio-economic pathways. The paper includes analysis\
    \ of RCP2.6 paired with SSP1 and RCP8.5 paired with SSP5."
  10: The analysis uses climate data from CMIP5 experiments via ISIMIP for four GCMs
    under different RCPs and SSPs. It assesses adaptation and exposure changes until
    the end of the century. The authors assume instantaneous adaptation to heat and
    no changes in health conditions or heat-related mortality.
  11: The study uses a re-calibrated multivariate non-linear model to estimate MMTs
    for cities based on climatic, topographic, and socio-economic variables. It uses
    historical (1965-1995) and future (2064-2094) climate data to estimate MMTs for
    2000 and 2099, respectively. The model is calibrated using gridded climate data
    from the ISIMIP project and socio-economic data from the World Bank and IIASA/OECD.
    The apparent temperature (AT) is calculated using daily mean temperature and dew
    point temperature.
  12: The paper uses historic and projected MMTs as thresholds to determine critical
    heat exposure. It counts the number of days ATmean exceeds the MMT annually for
    both a historic reference period (1991-2000) and a future period (2090-2099) under
    different RCP/SSP scenarios. The delta changes in EXD and MAG are then calculated.
    All calculations are performed in R.

More Notes:
  2: Defines 'adaptation' as a positive change in Maximum Mortality Temperature (MMT).
    Exposure is measured as frequency and magnitude of MMT exceedance by daily temperature.
    The analysis considers both adaptation and exposure to assess the potential to
    cope with heat. The paper aims to determine the 'lesser of two evils' regarding
    changes in mortality under different scenarios.
  4: The study suggests that SSP5 combinations (excluding RCP8.5) show high socio-economic
    levels and perform well concerning exposure reductions. The paper contrasts RCP2.6/SSP1
    and RCP8.5/SSP5 scenarios, which represent optimistic socio-economies with contrary
    future exposures.
  7: The paper emphasizes viewing adaptation and exposure jointly.
  10: The study focuses on ensemble means across GCMs. It notes that SSPs and instantaneous
    adaptation are potential sources of uncertainty.
  12: The study considers long-term physiological acclimatisation by using long-term
    climate variables to calculate MMTs. The feasibility of pairing RCP2.6 and SSP5
    is questioned. The study uses MMTs valid around the years 2000 and 2100. Adaptation
    likely does not change significantly from one year to another.

Quantitative material:
  1: By 2100, the risk to human health is expected to decline in 60% to 80% of cities
    against contemporary conditions.
  2: "Projected changes in MMT (Maximum Mortality Temperature), frequency of heat\
    \ exposure (EXD), and exposure magnitude (MAG) between 2000 and 2100 for 3820\
    \ cities worldwide; mean /Delta1MMT of 7.9 \xB0C is reached by RCP8.5/SSP5, the\
    \ highest forcing level and the most rapid unsustainable economic growth; This\
    \ also yields the highest absolute mean MMT for the city sample, 34.4 \xB0C. The\
    \ lowest mean /Delta1MMT (3.7 \xB0C) and the lowest absolute mean MMT (30.2 \xB0\
    C) are displayed for RCPs 4.5 with SSP3; /Delta1EXDs of \u2212 5.2 and \u2212\
    \ 1.4 for RCPs 4.5 and 6.0, respectively; a relatively large mean reduction of\
    \ \u2212 16.6 /Delta1EXD until the future decade is present for RCP2.6/SSP1; It\
    \ ranges between \u2212 0.2 C in RCP2.6/SSP1 and +0.2 C in RCP8.5/SSP5"
  4: "The study provides quantitative data on the change in exceedance days (\u0394\
    EXD) and Maximum Mortality Temperature (\u0394MMT) between 1991-2000 and 2090-2099\
    \ under different RCP/SSP scenarios. Specific examples of \u0394MMT changes for\
    \ various cities under RCP2.6/SSP1 and RCP8.5/SSP5 are given. Projected GDP/capita\
    \ values for different SSPs in 2100 are also provided (e.g., Int$ 101 205 for\
    \ SSP5)."
  6: "The paper provides quantitative estimates of changes in EXD and MAG under RCP2.6/SSP1\
    \ and RCP8.5/SSP5 scenarios, including specific values for individual cities (e.g.,\
    \ /Delta1MAG of \u2212 3.5 C for Copiap\xF3, Chile in the sustainable scenario).\
    \ It mentions cities potentially facing 50 to 92 additional EXD under RCP8.5/SSP5."
  7: Under RCP8.5/SSP5, 1150 (30%) cities will experience additional EXD and 1459
    (38%) a larger MAG by 2100. 705 (18%) cities will face more than one fourth of
    the year being EXD and 185 (5%) cities half the year being EXD. For five cities
    almost the entire year is projected to be EXD (> 350 EXD). Under RCP2.6/SSP1,
    224 (6%) cities will face additional EXD and 338 (9%) a higher MAG. 3207 cities
    (84%) will profit from less EXD and 3074 (80%) from a lower MAG. No changes in
    EXD or MAG will affect 389 (10%) and 408 (11%) cities, respectively.
  8: The analysis presents quantitative information such as the number and percentage
    of cities experiencing changes in extreme heat days (EXD) and changes in magnitude
    (MAG) of heat exposure from 1991-2000 to 2090-2099 under RCP2.6/SSP1 and RCP8.5/SSP5.
  9: In a RCP8.5/SSP5 future, 5.1 times as many cities will face more frequent heat
    exposures and 4.3 times as many will experience higher exposure magnitudes than
    in RCP2.6/SSP1.
  10: The paper calculates the change in heat exposure frequency (/Delta1EXD) and
    magnitude (/Delta1MAG) and proposes a functional relationship to estimate the
    change in future heat-related mortality (/Delta1MORT).
  11: The RMSE of the re-calibrated model ranked at 3.2 degrees Celsius, while the
    RMSE of the original model was 2.8 degrees Celsius.
  12: The paper calculates the change in the number of exposure days (/Delta1EXD)
    and the change in the mean exceedance magnitude (/Delta1MAG) between 1991-2000
    and 2090-2099 for 3820 cities under 15 different RCP/SSP combinations.
