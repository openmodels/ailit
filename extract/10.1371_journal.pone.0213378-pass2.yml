Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate variability, sudden shocks to resource availability, network topology.
  2: Climate variability, extreme weather events (wildfires, droughts), pest outbreaks,
    anthropogenic climate change.
  6: Climate variability scenarios involving resource availability changes over time,
    modeled as sine waves. Scenarios include low (5%) and high (50%) amplitude variations,
    with periods of 6 years (high frequency, representing ENSO) and 70 years (low
    frequency, representing AMO). Sudden shocks are also examined, where a node suddenly
    stops exporting food.
  7: Amplitude and frequency of resource production variability; in-phase and out-of-phase
    variability of resources; Network topology (size, centrality)
  10: Climate variability (amplitude and frequency); shocks to nodes in the food trade
    network; resource availability decreases.
  13: Shocks applied to nodes with varying centrality in a food trade network; Restriction
    on exports; Extreme climate variability; Dependency on fewer nodes in the trade
    network.
  14: Long-term climate variability, shocks (unspecified nature, but related to food
    trade), income inequalities across countries.
  15: Climate variability (specifically, the amplitude and frequency of variations
    in food production), network topology (structure of trade networks), and shocks
    to the food trade network.
Highlights:
  1: Redistribution of resources increases the maximum population that can be supported.
    Topology is the key factor determining the carrying capacity of a node. Central
    nodes achieve a higher carrying capacity and are less susceptible to long-term
    resource variability and shocks.
  2: Import-dependent and water-scarce countries are most vulnerable to shocks. Developing
    countries experience the highest losses in import volume due to sudden decreases
    in export volume in the network. Increasing number and diversity of trading partners
    and increasing food buffer stocks can increase resilience against shocks.
  7: Resource variability (amplitude and frequency) significantly impacts NEP and
    GEP. Lower frequencies and lower amplitude variability result in higher GEP with
    in-phase variability. Out-of-phase variability increases NEP and GEP compared
    to in-phase variability. Higher amplitudes and lower frequencies result in more
    variation of GEP over time.
  10: Larger small-world networks are more efficient at distributing resources. Central
    nodes are more resilient to shocks. Dependency on a shock node increases population
    loss. A shock applied to a central node has a larger impact on overall GEP.
  13: Population loss is larger when a shock is applied to a node with higher centrality.
    Dependency on fewer nodes makes a node more vulnerable to a shock. Networks with
    larger small-world properties are more effective in mitigating climate variability,
    and more central nodes are less vulnerable to long-term resource variability and
    shocks.
  14: Increasing network size (more trading partners) benefits all nodes in a food
    trade network. Increasing the number of links to a node increases its resilience.  A
    larger network is more efficient in redistributing resources, increasing the carrying
    capacity of the network. Trade shocks disproportionately affect poor, import-dependent
    countries.
  15: Resource redistribution can increase carrying capacities and population size
    when resource variability is out of phase between network parts; this effect is
    stronger with increasing network size.
Methodology:
  1: A model of population growth limited by resource availability in a trading network
    is used. Resources are redistributed based on supply and distance. Resource variability
    is modeled with wave parameters mimicking biomass production changes from climate
    variability. Random perturbations are applied to resources to study resilience.
  2: Combination of empirical and modelling approaches to study the effect of shocks
    on food availability in real-world food trade networks.
  6: A food trade network model is used to analyze the effects of climate variability
    and network topology on food trade resilience. Resource availability at nodes
    varies according to sine wave functions representing climate variability. The
    analysis considers in-phase and out-of-phase climate variability scenarios. The
    impact of shocks (nodes stopping exporting food) on hub, peripheral, and median-closeness
    centrality nodes are studied.
  7: Model results from simulations of a food trade network
  10: Network analysis is used to model the evolution and resilience of a food trade
    network over time. Simulations are performed to assess the impact of climate variability
    and shocks.
  13: Uses a model studying the effects of network topology and climate variability
    on food trade networks, specifically focusing on population dynamics after a shock
    to a node with varying centrality. The model simulates trade in a free-trade system
    where nodes reserve resources for export.
  14: Agent-based modeling of food trade networks, simplified gravity of trade equation.
    The model allows assessment of the effects on the long-term dynamics that are
    relevant for population growth and multi-decadal climate variability.
  15: A model simulates resource redistribution in a small-world network to study
    the effects of climate variability, network topology, and shocks on population
    growth.
More Notes:
  1: The model uses cities or countries as nodes in a trading network.
  2: Trade can increase the carrying capacity of a trade network without any increase
    in production.
  6: The study examines how resource variability impacts the carrying capacity of
    the food trade network and considers scenarios with both in-phase and out-of-phase
    resource variability to mimic climate phenomena like ENSO and NAO.
  7: The study focuses on the impact of resource variability and network topology
    on population within a food trade network, which can be used as a proxy for economic
    activity. The study seems to suggest that diversification (out-of-phase variability)
    provides resilience.
  10: The paper uses NEP and GEP as measures, which could be related to economic activity
    or welfare within the network's nodes, though not directly stated as GDP or productivity.
    Closeness centrality and distance to the shock node determine population loss
    after a shock. 'Nodes' represent countries or regions in a food trade network.
  13: The study highlights the decreased importance of food reserves in resilience
    to shocks in recent decades, due to decreased stock sizes. It also notes that
    the model setup differs from some other models because the exported resources
    are not counted toward the carrying capacity of the node.
  14: The paper focuses on the structure and resilience of food trade networks as
    impacted by climate variability and shocks, using a simplified model to isolate
    effects. Empirical complexities in real-world trade data limit isolating generalizable
    effects of climate variability, network topology, and shocks on carrying capacity.
  15: Central nodes (cities or countries with high connectivity in the trade network)
    are less vulnerable to resource variability and shocks due to greater access to
    resources through trade.

    variability.
  2: Global population will reach 9 billion by 2050 with 65% residing in cities.
  7: Low Amplitude High Frequency (LAHF) variability causes a 4.3% decrease in GEP
    compared to the baseline; Low Amplitude Low Frequency (LALF) variability causes
    a 3.5% decrease in GEP; High Amplitude High Frequency (HAHF) variability results
    in a 46.7% decrease in GEP compared to the baseline; High Amplitude Low Frequency
    (HALF) variability results in a 42.3% decrease in GEP; GEP increases with increasing
    network size under out-of-phase variability; Variation in GEP was 99% lower under
    LAHF than under HALF
  10: Coefficient of variation of GEP is 18% lower in a 100-node network compared
    to a 10-node network under the out of phase HALF scenario.
  13: 'GEP loss in non-shock nodes when a shock is applied to a node with lowest centrality:
    270; GEP loss in non-shock nodes when a shock is applied to a node with median
    centrality: 278; GEP loss in non-shock nodes when a shock is applied to a node
    with highest centrality: 285.'
