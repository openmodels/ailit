Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased drought severity in recent decades was linked to higher frequency of
    dry circulation types at the expense of wet types.
  5: Changes in frequency of circulation types over central Europe.
  6: Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) indicating moderate, severe, and extreme
    drought conditions; Circulation types (though the link to specific impacts is
    not made clear on this page)
  7: Not explicitly stated, but the study analyzes temporal variability of drought
    events.
  10: Shift to drier conditions related to large number of anticyclonic and southwesterly
    types (A, ASW, AW, and S), at the expense of cyclonic and northerly types.
Highlights:
  1: "The 2015\u20132018 drought was record\u2010breaking in the context of observational\
    \ record in central Europe"
  5: Strongly cyclonic and hybrid cyclonic circulation types were less frequent than
    anticyclonic analogues and directional circulation types. A type (anticyclonic)
    was most frequent in VEG. Advection from the western quadrant dominates in COLD.
    The pressure field in COLD is more distinctive than in VEG.
  6: The page focuses on analyzing drought conditions using the PDSI and linking them
    to circulation types. The temporal variability of drought is assessed at seven
    stations in the Czech Republic.
  7: "All stations showed negative PDSI trends (indicating increased drought) when\
    \ considering their whole periods of observation. The most recent period (1979\u2013\
    2018) was characterized by the largest negative PDSI trends, especially in Brno,\
    \ Prague, and Caslav. Extreme droughts were experienced from the 2000s onward."
  10: The 2015-2018 drought originated mainly from the dryness during vegetation periods.
    A noteworthy lack of cyclonic types occurred in COLD 2014/15, preceding the major
    drought that developed in VEG 2015.
Methodology:
  1: "Temporal variability of drought conditions since the late 19th century was analyzed\
    \ at seven long\u2010 term stations distributed across the Czech Republic using\
    \ the Palmer Drought Severity Index and the Standardized Precipitation Evaporation\
    \ Index."
  5: "Analysis based on Lamb (1972) catalogue circulation types, derived from Strength\
    \ (STR), Flow Direction (DIR), and Flow Vorticity (VORT) indices, modified by\
    \ Jenkinson and Collison (1977) and Plavcov\xE1 and Kysel\xFD (2011). Circulation\
    \ types were classified as unclassified (U), anticyclonic (A), cyclonic (C), directional\
    \ (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) or hybrid (e.g., ASW and CW)."
  6: Analysis of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) at seven stations. Drought
    tendencies are calculated as differences between consecutive weekly PDSI values.
    Circulation types are assigned weights based on their duration within a week to
    analyze their conduciveness to drought.
  7: Calculates linear trends of the PDSI. A modified Mann-Kendall trend test for
    autocorrelated data was used to assess statistical significance. Analysis performed
    on data from seven stations in the Czech Republic.
  10: Analysis linking drought indices (averaged over stations) to individual circulation
    types. Least squares regression lines are used to analyze temporal variability
    of dry and wet circulation type frequencies for vegetation and cold periods.
More Notes:
  1: It remains an open question whether the significantly increasing frequency of
    dry circulation types in the vegetation period is related to climate change, or
    rather represents multidecadal climate variability.
  5: The study area is central Europe. Relationships between circulation types and
    drought indices are mentioned in section 2.3, but only regarding drought index
    tendencies, not macroeconomic variables.
  6: The study uses a weighted average of drought tendencies based on circulation
    types to analyze the relationship between circulation and drought. The specific
    circulation types are not detailed on this page but are referenced as Table S1.
    The analysis is focused on drought tendencies and circulation types in relation
    to drought, without explicit connection to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes.

    in central Europe.

Quantitative material:
  1: "Record\u2010low values of the drought indices during 2015\u20132018 were found\
    \ in the Czech Republic."
  5: "Frequencies (percentages) of 27 circulation types (based on Lamb (1972) catalogue)\
    \ for vegetation (VEG) and cold (COLD) periods over 1948\u20132018; e.g., A type\
    \ at 7.2% for VEG."
  6: PDSI values for seven stations in the Czech Republic from 1875 to past 2000;
    Weights assigned to circulation types based on their duration within a week (1-7);
    weighted average of tendencies was calculated for COLD and VEG.
  7: 'Linear trends of the PDSI per decade for seven stations in the Czech Republic
    across four time periods (whole period, 1922-2018, 1948-2018, 1979-2018). Example:
    Prague (1876 start year): Trend (whole period) = -0.28, Trend (1922-2018) = -0.44,
    Trend (1948-2018) = -0.54, Trend (1979-2018) = -0.96. All trends are negative,
    indicating increasing drought severity. The most recent period (1979-2018) generally
    shows the largest negative trends.'
