  9: Increasingly frequent and severe droughts peaked in August 2019; strong winds
    showed notable spikes in September 2008 and January 2018; frequent cases of extremely
    high temperatures, with rarer occurrence of extremely low temperatures, indicating
    a rise in average Chinese temperature; incidences of concentrated precipitation
    reached the lowest levels in spring and summer of 2011.
  10: Weather shocks impacting macroeconomic variables like GDP, CPI, interest rates,
    and total credit.

  34: A one standard deviation weather shock is the driver of risk.
  35: Weather shocks, shocks to GDP, shocks to CPI, shocks to interest rates, and
    shocks to credit are drivers of risk.
  36: Weather shocks (one standard deviation).
  41: The analysis includes variables related to risk such as VIX (a measure of market
    volatility), credit spreads (mpu_us), geopolitical uncertainty (gepu), and leverage.
  42: ACI (the paper does not say what ACI is)
  43: ACI (variable definition not specified on this page but appears to be a measure
    of climate risk) and low levels of fixed, non-current, and tangible assets are
    examined as drivers of risk impacting loan availability.
  44: 'Asset Climate Index (ACI) interacted with: tight Monetary Policy (MP), Economic
    Policy Uncertainty (EPU), financial stress (stress), aggregate leverage of non-financial
    firms (leverage), and per capita value of outstanding Local Government Financing
    Vehicle (LGFV) bonds.'

Highlights:
  2: A negative weather shock leads to persistently low GDP and credit obtained by
    non-financial firms. The negative effects of extreme weather on firm level loans
    were statistically and practically significant. Credit risk and expectations are
    important impact channels.
  3: Weather shocks have a significant negative impact on the GDP and credit financing.
  4: "Weather shocks have a contractionary effect on GDP in China. Credit is an important\
    \ mechanism for propagating the impact of weather shocks on the real economy.\
    \ Extreme weather events reduce loans obtained by listed firms. Expected default\
    \ risk rises after extreme weather shocks. Firms with higher collateral assets\
    \ experience a smaller drop in credit following extreme weather shocks. Extreme\
    \ weather shocks cause stock analysts to downgrade the ratings of listed firms\
    \ and reduce their profit forecasts. Weather shocks reduce loans by a larger magnitude\
    \ when expectations (measured by the entrepreneurs\u2019 confidence index and\
    \ the production managers\u2019 index (PMI)) are weak."
  6: Monetary policies should address weather shocks in a climate change environment;
    Extreme weather impacts loans more when expectations and confidence are lower.
  8: The monthly Chinese ACI initially trended downward, before rapidly rising after
    2015. The end of the sampling period saw the highest 5-year average ACI since
    2000. The ACI substantially varies and indicates frequent short-term weather shocks.
  9: The authors constructed an Aggregate Climate Index (ACI) to measure weather risks
    in China from 1990 to 2020; they validate this index against an existing Chinese
    climate risk index.
  10: A significant and persistent negative GDP response to weather shocks is observed.
  11: Weather shocks lead to persistently low economic activities; Short-term monetary
    easing is insufficient for averting the long-term impact of weather shocks on
    credit access; The impact of weather risks on GDP varies over time.
  12: Weather shocks are significant in explaining GDP, CPI, and credit variations;
    lesser impact on interest rates.
  13: Monetary policy should consider the effects of weather shocks as non-reactive
    policy results in a larger GDP drop.
  14: The paper tests whether extreme weather affects bank loans obtained by companies
    in China. Non-SOEs may be more sensitive to extreme weather conditions due to
    financial constraints.
  15: Extreme weather (as measured by ACI) significantly reduces bank loans obtained
    by companies, as evidenced by a drop in the bank loans to assets ratio.
  16: Extreme weather shocks have a statistically significant effect on reducing bank
    loans, attributed to increased default risk.
  17: Extreme weather depresses bank loans by elevating firm-level default risk. Firms
    with less collateral face more difficulty obtaining bank loans after extreme weather
    shocks. Adverse effects of extreme weather on firm-level loans are more severe
    when monetary policy is tighter.
  18: Greater drop in loans when macroeconomic credit risk is higher, especially in
    provinces where local government borrowing crowds out corporate borrowing.
  19: Extreme weather dampens market expectations, hindering credit access for listed
    companies; Higher corporate confidence moderates the negative effects of weather
    shocks on loan availability.
  20: Non-SOE firms, younger firms, and smaller firms face more significant reductions
    in credit financing following extreme weather shocks; the services and industrial
    sectors also experience negative impacts except for the primary sector, likely
    due to sample size.
  21: Extreme weather leads to reduced long- and short-term loans. Long-term loans
    experience a larger impact of climatic risks than short-term loans. Extreme weather
    increases firms' interest rate expenses. The impact of extreme weather on loans
    is less severe for firms in the secondary sector with higher non-current assets.
  23: Extreme weather shocks have a negative effect on firm-level output (value added).
  24: Negative impact of extreme weather events on firm-level value-added, with robustness
    tests confirming the findings are not driven by specific years or unobserved aggregate
    events.
  25: The negative effects of weather shocks (ACI) are stronger in high-weather-risk
    regimes for both loan and value-added regressions. A drop in loans obtained following
    an ACI shock may be caused by a drop in supply or demand of loans.
  26: A negative weather shock depresses GDP and credit in the long term, and lowers
    the interest rate in the short term. Climate risk likely reduces the supply of
    bank loans.
  27: Extreme weather has a significant impact on the Chinese economy, particularly
    on firms' credit access.
  31: Climate change affects mortgage credit costs, municipal bonds, financial stress
    in emerging markets, agricultural productivity, and labor supply. Temperature
    impacts time allocation. The effect of climate change on extreme weather events
    is also addressed.
  33: The paper compares the authors' ACI with the NCC's climate risk index for China,
    revealing the trend of climate risk over time.
  34: A one standard deviation weather shock leads to negative impacts on GDP, CPI,
    'Rate', and 'Credit' over a 20 quarter period. The specific magnitude of the impact
    can be read from the figure. For example, GDP declines by approximately 0.4 percent
    after around 8 quarters.
  35: In 2020, there is a significant negative spike, dominated by a large negative
    GDP shock. Around 2008-2009, coinciding with the financial crisis, the shocks
    are mostly negative.
  36: The paper analyzes the impact of weather shocks on output under the counterfactual
    scenario where monetary policy remains passive.
  40: ACI shocks explain a significant portion of the variance in GDP, CPI, interest
    rate, and credit, particularly at longer time horizons.
  41: Several coefficients are statistically significant (denoted by ***, **,*), indicating
    significant relationships between the independent variables and the dependent
    variable (ACI). The effect of several control variables (age, assets) on the dependent
    variable are found to be significant.
  42: ACI is positively and significantly associated with the expected default frequency
    of individual firms, even after controlling for other factors.
  43: The interaction terms (ACI*low fixed assets, ACI*low non-current assets, ACI*low
    tangible assets) are all negative and statistically significant, suggesting that
    firms with lower levels of these assets are more negatively impacted by ACI on
    their access to bank loans.
  44: The Asset Climate Index (ACI) has a statistically significant negative impact
    on the bank loan ratio to total assets. This impact is exacerbated by tight monetary
    policy, economic policy uncertainty, and financial stress. The per capita value
    of outstanding LGFV bonds has a significant positive impact on the bank loan ratio
    to total assets when considered alone, but a negative effect when interacted with
    ACI.
  45: The Analyst Coverage Index (ACI) has a statistically significant impact on average
    ratings, modal ratings, a discrete measure of average rating, and mean analysts'
    forecast of net profit.
  46: ACI*Confidence, ACI*PMI-New-order and ACI*PMI have statistically significant
    positive impacts on the bank loans ratio to total assets. ACI, Confidence, PMI-New-order
    and PMI all individually have statistically significant negative impacts on the
    bank loans ratio to total assets. The coefficients on interaction terms (ACI*Confidence,
    ACI*PMI-New-order, and ACI*PMI) are positive and significant.
  47: Climate risk (ACI) is negatively associated with firm-level loan/asset ratio.
    This effect is more pronounced for non-state-owned enterprises, younger firms,
    firms with low fixed assets, and firms with low sales.
  50: Extreme temperatures (P10 and P90) have large negative and statistically significant
    impacts on the ACI measures. Drought and Rain also have statistically significant
    negative impacts. Wind has a statistically significant, but positive, impact.
  51: The table shows the effects of different macroeconomic and policy uncertainty
    variables on firm-level outcomes, particularly ACI (the variable of interest)
    and ROA. The results appear to be statistically significant based on the asterisks.
    There are differences in outcomes in different periods (2008-2009, 2020).
  52: A higher climate risk index (ACI) is associated with lower bank loan ratios
    and lower value-added. The relationship between ACI and bank loans is robust to
    controlling for excess reserves and capital adequacy ratios.
  53: Climate risk (ACI) is negatively associated with bank loan amounts.
Methodology:
  2: Structural vector auto-regression model on macroeconomic data; Regression analysis
    of a panel of firms listed in China.
  3: Structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model estimated for ACI, GDP, CPI, interest
    rate, and total credit obtained by non-financial firms, from 2001 Q1 to 2020 Q4.
  4: VAR model (to examine aggregate evidence), Panel regression analysis (to focus
    on credit and credit-related factors)
  8: The Chinese ACI is constructed by standardizing monthly precipitation (P90 and
    P10), temperature (R), dryness (D), and wind (W) data from 1990 to 2020. Standardization
    is performed by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of
    each variable in each month, using the period January 1990 to December 2005 as
    the reference period. The ACI is then calculated as ACIt = P90stdt - P10stdt +
    Rstdt + Dstdt + Wstdt.
  9: An Aggregate Climate Index (ACI) was constructed from 1990-2020 based on five
    components; the index was validated by comparing it with the China Climate Risk
    Index published by the National Climate Center (NCC) of China; the index was converted
    to a quarterly ACI by taking the quarterly mean.
  10: A five-variable Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model is estimated to
    identify the effect of weather risks on China's macroeconomy using quarterly data
    for ACI, GDP, CPI, interest rate, and total credit from non-financial firms.
  11: SVAR (Structural Vector Autoregression) is used with detrending and demeaning
    of variables; historical and variance decompositions are performed.
  12: Analysis performed using variance decomposition in SVAR model assessing weather
    shocks' impact over multiple quarters.
  13: The analysis employs a counterfactual approach where monetary policy does not
    react to weather shocks, using a sequence of hypothetical monetary policy shocks;
    the modesty statistic is used to ensure realistic counterfactual shock size.
  14: Firm-level panel regression with fixed effects. The model examines the effect
    of a Chinese climate risk index (ACI) on the ratio of bank loans to total assets,
    controlling for firm-level assets, firm age, and fraction of tangible assets in
    total assets. The data covers Chinese companies between 2006 Q1 and 2020 Q4.
  15: Regression analysis with time- and firm-fixed effects. ACI is lagged by one
    quarter. ACI jump events are defined using Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filtered ACI.
  16: "The analysis uses an index of global economic policy uncertainty, US monetary\
    \ policy uncertainty, China\u2019s M2 growth rate, GDP growth rate, and credit\
    \ gap to control economic conditions."
  17: Regression analysis using firm-level data. Indicator variables used for tight
    monetary policy and firms with low levels of various asset types. Interactions
    of variables are included in regression models.
  18: Regression analysis including economic policy uncertainty, financial stress,
    leverage, and interactions with ACI.
  19: "Regression analysis of firm-level ratings by stock analysts on the ACI; Regression\
    \ analysis with interactions between the ACI and expectation-related macroeconomic\
    \ variables (Entrepreneurs\u2019 Confidence Index (ECI), the Purchasing Managers\u2019\
    \ Index (PMI), and the new-order component of the PMI index)."
  20: The analysis uses regressions with interactions between variables measuring
    firm heterogeneity and ACI, reporting the results for firm and sector-level heterogeneity.
  21: Regression analysis using alternative credit financing measures (change in long-term
    debt-to-assets ratio, change in short-term debt-to-assets ratio, and log interest
    expenses) as dependent variables and value-added as the dependent variable.
  23: Regression analysis of firm-level value added, using a two-quarter lag of the
    ACI. Value added is constructed from balance sheet and income statement data using
    the value-added method of GDP accounting. Firm and time fixed effects are included.
  24: The analysis uses value-added regressions similar to loan regressions, controls
    for various macroeconomic variables, performs period exclusions, and runs placebo
    tests with artificial samples.
  25: Firm-level regressions, including controls for aggregate supply of loans (excess
    reserve ratio, capital adequacy ratio)
  26: SVAR model of ACI, GDP, CPI, interest rate, and total credit obtained by non-financial
    firms from 2001 to 2020. Regression of bank-level loans on ACI, controlling for
    national demand for loans from 2006 to 2020.
  27: Panel dataset of Chinese firms from 2006-2020 used to estimate effects on credit
    financing; analyses show loans drop after weather events.
  29: Empirical analysis using personnel data, macroeconomic modeling, and financial
    market data.
  31: Econometric analysis, statistical modelling
  33: The ACI is calculated using the authors' own methods based on data from the
    National Climate Center (NCC) of China. One alternative definition of the ACI
    is presented.
  34: Impulse response functions are used to assess the impact of a weather shock.
    The solid lines are mean impulse responses, and shaded areas are 95% confidence
    intervals.
  35: The analysis uses a Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model after detrending
    and demeaning the variables. The actual deviation of GDP from its trend is decomposed
    into contributions from exogenous shocks.
  36: Counterfactual analysis simulating a scenario where monetary policy does not
    react to weather shocks.
  40: Variance decomposition analysis is used to assess the impact of ACI shocks on
    various macroeconomic variables. The horizon is up to 200 quarters. Summary statistics
    are provided for a panel dataset of Chinese firms.
  41: The analysis uses regressions with fixed effects (FE) at least for time and
    firm levels (olsFEFE). It includes robust standard errors. The regressions are
    estimated for different sample periods such as 2020, 2008-2009.
  42: Panel regression with firm and time fixed effects, using a one-quarter lag of
    ACI. Robust standard errors are used. Control variables as in column (2) of Table
    3 (not shown).
  43: The analysis uses panel data regressions with firm and time fixed effects and
    control variables. The results are applicable to firms in the sample and period
    studied. ACI is lagged by one quarter.
  44: Panel data regression analysis with firm and time fixed effects and control
    variables. A one-quarter lag of ACI is used. Robust standard errors are reported.
    Significance levels are indicated by asterisks.
  45: The analysis uses regressions with firm-fixed effects, time-fixed effects, and
    control variables, with robust standard errors. Significance levels are indicated
    by *, **, and *** (10%, 5%, and 1% respectively).
  46: Panel data regression with firm-fixed effects, time-fixed effects, and control
    variables (as in column 2 of Table 3 - not specified here). Robust standard errors
    are used. ACI is lagged by one quarter.
  47: Firm-level panel data regression with firm and time fixed effects, using a one-quarter
    lag of ACI. Includes control variables as in column 2 of Table 3 (not detailed
    here).
  50: Regression analysis with fixed effects (FEFE). Includes firm and time fixed
    effects. Uses standardized climate variables. Control variables are included.
    The coefficients represent the effect of climate variables on the ACI measures.
  51: The analysis involves panel regressions with firm fixed effects (FE) and time
    fixed effects. The data appears to cover multiple years (YYY), and firm N2R is
    an indicator of if the firm is a national two-rate-tax payer.
  52: Panel data regression with firm and time fixed effects. Table 14 uses a one-quarter
    lag of ACI in the loan regression and two-quarter lag of ACI in the value added
    regression. Table 15 uses a one-quarter lag of ACI in the regression.

    Includes controls, time fixed effects, and firm fixed effects. A one-quarter lag
    of ACI is used. Robust standard errors are reported.
More Notes:
  2: The effects of weather shocks on firm loans are amplified by high existing credit
    risk or low confidence among firm managers.
  3: The study examines the impact of extreme weather events on the Chinese economy
    at both macroeconomic and firm levels, with a microeconomic analysis using panel
    regressions of loans obtained, and value-added produced by listed firms on the
    ACI, from 2006 Q1 to 2020 Q4.
  4: The study focuses on China. The 'ACI index' is a measure of weather shocks (the
    study does not define what ACI is)
  8: The Chinese ACI peaks in September 2019 due to decreased precipitation in several
    provinces according to the China Meteorological Administration.
  9: The ACI series provides a reasonable measure of weather risks from 1990 to 2020,
    based on official Chinese meteorological data; the study intends to match the
    quarterly ACI with macroeconomic and firm-level variables.
  11: The adverse effect of weather shocks on GDP between 2001 and 2006 is likely
    caused by the drought indicator being above sample average. Between 2011 and 2015,
    weather shocks had either an insignificant or a positive effect on GDP growth
    while concentrated precipitation and extreme low temperature indicators were low.
  14: The dataset is an unbalanced panel of 4,186 firms and 251,160 firm-quarter observations.
    The climate risk variable is lagged by one quarter.
  15: The study uses the bank loans to assets ratio as a proxy for credit availability.
    The regressions control for time and firm-fixed effects. The R-squared value of
    0.175 for the simple regression of credit on the ACI and time fixed effects indicates
    that a significant portion of the variation in loans can be accounted for by the
    ACI and time fixed effects.
  17: The availability of collateral assets moderates the effects of weather shocks.
    The proxy for extreme weather used is ACI.
  19: The analysis focuses on listed companies in the CSMAR database (Chinese Stock
    Market & Accounting Research database).
  21: The increase in interest rate expenses due to extreme weather is consistent
    with the theory that credit premiums are negatively related to firms' net worth.
    Extreme weather aggravates default risk of firms and lowers their net worth, leading
    banks to demand a higher credit premium.
  23: Value-added is constructed by the researchers due to the absence of reported
    value-added in financial statements.
  25: The analysis attempts to address the endogeneity of loan supply and demand.
  26: The study focuses on China and uses an Aggregate Climate Index (ACI) to measure
    extreme weather. The counterfactual analysis finds that the impact of a weather
    shock becomes more severe if monetary policy does not loosen after the weather
    shocks.
  27: Study highlights gaps in existing research and future research directions, particularly
    around economic consequences of climate change in China and policy use to mitigate
    extreme weather effects.
  33: The page presents a time series visualization of the ACI and compares it to
    the NCC climate risk index, potentially indicating how the authors are attempting
    to quantify climate-related risk and its evolution.
  35: The historical decomposition covers the period from 2000 to 2020.
  36: The analysis is specific to the impact of monetary policy response or lack thereof
    to weather shocks.
  41: The dependent variable is 'ACI,' which appears to be some form of aggregate
    climate index. The analysis includes various controls, such as firm age, asset
    levels, and macroeconomic indicators. The regressions are estimated for different
    specifications (columns 1-7) to test the robustness of the results. Results are
    also given for different samples of data from different years and geographical
    locations (U.S. and China). Results explore the response of significant intangible
    policy levers.
  42: The paper does not define the 'ACI' variable. The coefficients are small, but
    the mean EDF is also relatively small (0.491), so the percentage impact of ACI
    may be more meaningful. The regression R-squared values are 0.354 and 0.391.
  43: "The paper examines the role of collateral (fixed assets, non-current assets,\
    \ tangible assets) in the credit risk channel related to climate change (as measured\
    \ by ACI). The dependent variable\u2019s mean is 14.842"
  44: The study focuses on the credit risk channel and its impact on bank lending
    behavior in response to climate-related factors. The sample size varies slightly
    across specifications (N=108225 or 92810). The R-squared values are high (0.593
    to 0.614), indicating a good fit for the models.
  45: The dependent variables are based on analysts' ratings (buy, increase, neutral,
    reduce, and sell) and forecasts of net profit.
  46: The meaning of ACI is not specified in the provided text. The control variables
    used are not specified in the provided text (referenced to Table 3).
  47: The dependent variable mean is 14.842. The R-squared values are around 0.59.
    The sample sizes range from 99138 to 108225. The definition of ACI is not provided
    on this page.
  50: The dependent variables ACI_b, ACI_c, and ACI_d are not clearly defined, but
    appear to be some kind of activity or cost index. Significance levels are denoted
    by *, **, and ***. Standard errors are in parentheses. 'Y' indicates the inclusion
    of fixed effects.
  51: The text refers to "significant tangible lever uncertainty." The number of observations
    (N) is around 120,000-130,000. Some regressions are estimated with and without
    certain variables (w/o).
  52: The ACI is a climate risk index constructed by the authors but not defined here.
    The analysis uses firm-level data.
  53: The dependent variable's mean is 26.900. Model 1 has 1641 observations and an
    R2 of 0.983. Model 2 has 1218 observations and an R2 of 0.999.

    shock, with a 0.2% drop in the first quarter and a maximum drop of 0.5% in the
    third quarter.
  11: GDP drops approximately 0.4% due to weather shocks; CPI inflation becomes negative
    and significant, reaching approximately -0.1%; Interest rate drops initially by
    -0.1% before returning to zero; Credit obtained by non-financial firms experiences
    a long-term significant decline.
  12: Weather shocks explain fluctuations in GDP, CPI, and credit obtained by non-financial
    firms; lesser variation in interest rates.
  13: The GDP drop following a one-standard-deviation weather shock is -0.49% under
    the counterfactual scenario with no monetary policy reaction, deeper than the
    -0.42% drop when monetary policy reacts to weather shocks.

  33: The paper constructs an ACI (Aggregate Climate Index) and relates it to the
    NCC (National Climate Center) China Climate Risk Index.
  34: GDP and CPI (Consumer Price Index) are macroeconomic outcomes of interest.
  35: GDP effects and CPI (Consumer Price Index) are outcomes of interest.
  36: GDP effects measured as percent change in output.
  40: GDP, CPI (Consumer Price Index), interest Rate, and credit.
  41: The analysis includes variables like GDP, assets, and return on assets (ROA),
    which are relevant to macroeconomic outcomes and potentially the economic costs
    and benefits of adaptation.
  42: Expected Default Frequency (EDF) of individual firms, which can be linked to
    macroeconomic stability via credit risk.
  43: Bank loan ratio to total assets is the dependent variable, suggesting an interest
    in financial stability and credit availability at the firm level.
  44: Bank loan ratio to total assets (loan/asset)
  45: No relevant information
  46: Bank loans ratio to total assets
  47: Firm-level loan/asset ratio.
  50: ACI_b, ACI_c, ACI_d (potentially representing some measure of economic activity
    or cost as they are dependent variables)
  51: GDP effects are mentioned, with GDP used as a dependent and independent variable
    in regressions.
  52: Bank loans ratio to total assets; log value-added

Quantitative material:
  2: The negative effects of weather shocks on firm level loans were statistically
    and practically significant.
  3: China ranked 41 in climate risks from 2000 to 2019 based on the Global Climate
    Risk Index. China held the first and fifth position in terms of economic losses
    and fatalities, respectively.
  4: A one standard deviation shock to ACI index causes GDP to drop by 0.5% in the
    third quarter. ACI shocks account for 14.2% of the variation in GDP in the long
    term. If the central bank does not react to weather shocks, the size of the drop
    in GDP following a one-standard-deviation weather shock will worsen from -0.42%
    to -0.49% in the long term.
  8: The mean ACI in the sample range was -0.073, with a standard deviation of 1.89.
    The variable ranged from -4.09 to 8.91. September 2019 saw the maximum value of
    the monthly ACI because P90std and Dstd were extremely high.
  9: The correlation coefficient between the authors' ACI and the NCC China Climate
    Risk Index was 0.44; the correlation coefficient between an alternative ACI and
    NCC China Climate Risk Index increases to 0.50; the mean, minimum, maximum and
    standard deviation of the quarterly ACI are, -0.017, -1.66, 2.16, and 0.86.
  10: Yes, after a weather shock, GDP drops by 0.2% in the first quarter and 0.5%
    in the third quarter.
  11: GDP drop of 0.4%; CPI inflation drop of -0.1%; Interest rate drop of -0.1%
  12: Weather risks explain 1% GDP drop in 2020; 18.3% GDP variance in Q16 and 14.2%
    in long-term; 11.5% long-term CPI variation; 4.7% and 13.8% for interest rates
    and credit variation, respectively.
  13: Quantitative information includes the comparison of GDP drop under counterfactual
    (-0.49%) and factual (-0.42%) scenarios following a weather shock.
  14: The mean ratio of bank loans to total assets was 14.84%, with a standard deviation
    of 13.84%. The variable range is 0.11% to 68.20%. 72.7% of firm-quarter observations
    are accounted for by non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs).
  15: A one-unit increase in ACI causes the bank loans to assets ratio to drop by
    0.232 percentage points (baseline specification). ACI 'jump' events (defined as
    exceeding the mean value by 1.65 times the standard deviation) cause a drop of
    0.374 or 0.568 percentage points. Excluding the 2008-2009 or 2020 periods results
    in drops of 0.140 or 0.214 percentage points respectively.
  16: Coefficient estimates and results from placebo tests suggest a significant negative
    impact of ACI shocks on bank loans.
  17: Interaction coefficients between ACI (extreme weather) and collateral proxies
    (low fixed-assets, low non-current-assets, low tangible assets) are significant
    and negative. Interaction coefficient between tight monetary policy and extreme
    weather is negative.
  19: Analysts' forecasts of firm profits decrease significantly due to extreme weather.
  21: Extreme weather increases firms' interest rate expenses.
  23: 'Coefficient of ACI_d in value-added regression: -0.240. Coefficient of ACI
    in the benchmark regression for loans: -0.232.'
  24: A one-unit change in the ACI index reduces a firm's value-added by 0.8%.
  25: Baseline coefficient on ACI shock of -0.008 in real-world sample
  26: Following a one standard deviation shock to the ACI index, GDP drops by 0.5%
    in the third quarter. Weather shocks account for 14.2% of GDP fluctuations in
    the long run.

  33: The figures show the ACI and NCC index values over time (monthly and quarterly),
    with specific years marked on the x-axis (2016-2019) and a numerical scale for
    the index values on the y-axis.
  34: The figure shows the impact of a one standard deviation weather shock on GDP
    and CPI over 20 quarters, measured in percentage changes. It also shows the impact
    of the same weather shock on 'Rate' (likely interest rate) and 'Credit' over 20
    quarters, measured in percentage changes.
  35: The Y-axis ranges from -0.08 to 0.04, representing the magnitude of the shocks.
  36: Figure 7 shows a counterfactual analysis where monetary policy does not react
    to weather shocks. The green dashed line shows the percent change in output over
    20 quarters.
  40: Table 1 provides the variance decomposition of GDP, CPI, interest rate, and
    credit explained by ACI shocks across different time horizons (Q1, Q4, Q8, Q16,
    Q200). For example, ACI shocks explain 2.797469% of GDP variation in Q1, increasing
    to 14.20422% by Q200. Table 2 provides summary statistics for firms in China,
    including loan/asset ratio, value-added, sales, assets, tangible assets, ROA,
    long-term debt, short-term debt, interest expenses, Non-SOE indicator, and age.
  41: The table presents regression results with coefficients, standard errors in
    parentheses, and significance levels (*, **, ***). Specific coefficients are reported
    for various variables like age, ln(asset), leverage, gepu, mpu_usvix, m2, gdp,
    and creditto_cons. There are also R-squared values (e.g., 0.594, 0.601, 0.600,
    0.592, 0.593, 0.175) and N values representing sample sizes (e.g., 108225, 96087,
    98723, 121137).
  42: ACI has a statistically significant positive effect on EDF. In column (1), a
    one-unit increase in ACI is associated with a 0.004 increase in EDF (significant
    at the 1% level). In column (2), a one-unit increase in ACI is associated with
    a 0.001 increase in EDF (significant at the 5% level).
  43: The table presents regression coefficients, standard errors, R-squared values,
    and sample sizes related to the impact of ACI and asset levels on the bank loan
    ratio to total assets.
  44: The table presents coefficients from regressions with loan/asset as the dependent
    variable. For example, ACI*tight MP has a coefficient of -0.371*** (significant
    at the 1% level), ACI alone has coefficients ranging from -0.099** to -0.248***
    across different specifications, and LGFV bond alone has a coefficient of 0.209***.
  45: For example, a 1 unit increase in the ACI is associated with a 0.008 unit increase
    in the average rating, significant at the 1% level. A 1 unit increase in the ACI
    is associated with a 0.009 decrease in profit forecast, significant at the 1%
    level.
  46: The table shows regression results with coefficients and standard errors for
    the impact of ACI, Confidence, PMI-New-order, and PMI on the bank loans ratio
    to total assets. Significant coefficients are marked with *** (1%), ** (5%), and
    * (10%). The mean of the dependent variable is 14.842. R-squared is 0.593.
  47: The table presents regression coefficients for the impact of ACI and its interactions
    with firm characteristics on the loan/asset ratio. For example, ACI has a negative
    and statistically significant impact on loan/asset ratio across all models (-0.273
    to -0.285, p<0.01). The interaction terms (ACI*NonSOE, ACI*young, ACI*low-fixed
    assets, ACI*low-sales) also have negative and statistically significant coefficients
    (p<0.01).
  50: 'Coefficients for the climate variables (e.g., Wind: 0.123*, Drought: -0.320***,
    Rain: -0.268***, P10: -0.646***, P90: -0.673***), standard errors in parentheses,
    and significance levels (*, **, ***). Also, a coefficient for a time period 1960-1989:
    -0.264***.'
  51: Several regression results are presented with coefficients and standard errors,
    and significance levels indicated by asterisks. The table includes R-squared values.
    Variable names appear to be ln(asset), tangibleROA, age, lever, m2, gdp, and creditto_cons.
    ACI and ROA also appear as outcomes.
  52: 'Table 14: ACI and ACI*ACI+ have statistically significant negative impacts
    on loan to asset ratio and log value-added; Table 15: ACI has a statistically
    significant negative impact on bank loans ratio to total assets.'
  53: 'ACI has a negative and statistically significant coefficient in both regression
    models. In Model 1: -0.015*** (significant at 1% level). In Model 2: -0.003**
    (significant at 5% level). National loan demand has a positive and statistically
    significant coefficient in Model 2: 0.001** (significant at 5% level).'
