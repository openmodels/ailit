Drivers of Risk:
  1: Tropical cyclones
  5: Tropical cyclone (TC) landfalls, influenced by natural climate variability such
    as ENSO, and potentially affected by underreporting in historical data.
  6: Impact of tropical cyclones on population and assets due to variations in wind
    speed thresholds.
  7: Tropical cyclones (TCs) and associated wind speeds (34, 64, and 96 knots).
  9: Tropical cyclones
Highlights:
  1: The associated spatially explicit and aggregated country-event-level exposure
    data (TCE-DAT) cover the period 1950 to 2015 and are freely available.
  5: The TCE-DAT dataset provides gridded wind speed information and exposed population
    and assets for historical tropical cyclones, allowing for analysis of TC risk.
    However, data before 1980 should be treated with caution due to underreporting.
  6: Higher vulnerability and exposure are present at lower wind speed thresholds
    (34 kn), with significant fluctuations over time in both population and asset
    exposure.
  7: The TCE-DAT dataset provides a new and comprehensive data set for global historical
    TC exposure between 1950 and 2015, including spatially explicit exposure at the
    grid level and aggregated exposed population and exposed assets by event and country
    for 5335 events based on 2713 TCs, separating exposure to wind speeds above 34,
    64, and 96kn.
  9: Aims to provide data for analyzing the economic impacts of climate-related events
    like tropical cyclones.
Methodology:
  1: Applies a simplified wind field model to estimate the areas exposed to wind speeds
    above 34, 64, and 96 knots (kn). Based on available spatially explicit data on
    population densities and gross domestic product (GDP) it estimates (1) the number
    of people and (2) the sum of assets exposed to wind speeds above these thresholds
    accounting for temporal changes in historical distribution of population and assets
    (TCE-hist) and assuming fixed 2015 patterns (TCE-2015).
  2: Uses the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) for spatially explicit
    population data.
  5: The paper uses the Holland08 wind field model to generate wind fields for tropical
    cyclones based on statistical properties. It uses the IBTrACS database as a historical
    record of TC activity. Limitations of the wind field model exist, especially for
    storms with unusual properties.
  6: Estimates are based on TCE-DAT and HURDAText data sets, comparing fixed 2015
    and historical patterns of population and asset exposure to evaluate reliability.
  7: Overlaying estimated wind fields with gridded information about population and
    assets to assess exposure. Comparison of exposure estimates derived from observation-based
    HURDAText and generic Holland08 wind field data.
  9: Historical data (1850-2005) harmonized with future projections (2006-2100) according
    to the Shared Socio-economic Pathways
More Notes:
  1: The dataset (TCE-DAT) is considered key information to (1) assess the contribution
    of climatological versus socioeconomic drivers of changes in exposure to tropical
    cyclones, (2) estimate changes in vulnerability from the difference in exposure
    and reported damages and calibrate associated damage functions, and (3) build
    improved exposure-based predictors to estimate higher-level societal impacts such
    as long-term effects on GDP, employment, or migration.
  5: The paper acknowledges potential underreporting of TCs in the IBTrACS database
    prior to 1980, particularly in the Indian and South Pacific Oceans, which might
    affect trend analysis. The wind field model provides a gross approximation of
    the actual wind field and may not accurately capture wind fields of unusual storms.
  6: Validation of exposure estimates uses the United States as a test region to compare
    TCE-DAT with comprehensive observational records.
  7: The generic wind field modeling approach may lead to deviations from actually
    realized exposure for selected events. The data is based on publicly available
    data sources.

    and Yoshiki Yamagata for improving and adapting their gridded GDP data.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: long-term development such as dampening of economic output, e.g., by reduced
    education achievements, mortality, and displacement
  5: The paper uses tropical cyclone (TC) wind fields to estimate exposed population
    and assets, which could be used as input to models estimating macroeconomic or
    fiscal outcomes related to damage and disruption from TCs.
  7: Exposed population and exposed assets (implicitly related to economic damage).
  9: Continuous national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) time series for 195 countries;
    Spatially-explicit Gross Cell Product (GCP) time series
Outcomes of Interest:
  6: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: USD29 billion of direct damages and 22 million people affected on average each
    year
  6: Graphs provide quantitative data on global exposed population (in billions) and
    assets (in trillion USD, PPP 2005 $) to tropical cyclones from 1970 to 2015.
  7: Comparison of exposed population and assets based on wind speed estimates from
    Holland08 and HURDAText databases, including correlation coefficients and counts
    of events at different wind speed thresholds.
  9: Provides GDP time series data and tropical cyclone exposure data sets
