Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased water demands and the impacts of climate change
  6: Climate change (IPSL-CM5A-LR coupled Global Circulation Model using the RCP6.0
    climate scenario), socio-economic factors (SSP2 scenario-derived water demands),
    groundwater drawdowns.
Highlights:
  1: Developed a modelling capacity for rapidly generating scenario-based water availability
    projections with operational relevance in a rigorous, systematic way
  6: Determines operational freshwater availability by modeling the hydrological cycle
    and groundwater flows under climate change and socio-economic scenarios.
Methodology:
  1: Rapid screening method to estimate current and future operational freshwater
    availability using global-scale models; Operational Freshwater Availability (OFWA)
    was computed using the PCR-GLOBWB global hydrology and water resources model,
    coupled to a global MODFLOW groundwater model; PCR-GLOBWB was forced with rainfall
    and temperature fields from the IPSL-CM5A-LR climate model under the RCP6.0 climate
    scenario, with water demands based on the SSP2 socio-economic scenario; Downscaling
    of the coupled PCR-GLOBWB-MODFLOW model to 90 m resolution.
  6: Uses PCR-GLOBWB (global hydrological model) coupled with MODFLOW (global groundwater
    model GGWM and GGWM-NHI) and iMOD modeling software to simulate water storages,
    fluxes, and groundwater flows under climate change scenarios. Calibrates river
    runoff on measured discharges and validates with monthly time series. Analyzes
    freshwater availability from 1980-2065
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on freshwater availability, which is a crucial input for many
    economic activities. While it doesn't directly quantify macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes, changes in water availability could have downstream impacts on GDP,
    productivity, and public expenditure related to water management.
  6: The study uses a combination of climate models, hydrological models, and groundwater
    models to assess the impact of climate change and socio-economic factors on freshwater
    availability at a global scale.

  2: This page focuses on water availability and risk assessment methodologies, without
    quantifying macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes related to climate change adaptation
    at a national level.
  5: This page focuses on defining and calculating operational freshwater availability
    (OFWA) and its components (OSWA and OGWA). It does not address macroeconomic or
    fiscal outcomes, nor does it provide quantitative estimates of economic costs/benefits
    of adaptation at a national level. It only discusses a method for determining
    water availability.
