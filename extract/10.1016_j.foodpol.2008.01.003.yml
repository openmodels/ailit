Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in country-wide rainfall and temperature
  2: Climate change, specifically rising temperatures and declining rainfall, is suggested
    as a factor impacting agricultural performance in Sub-Saharan Africa.
  3: Climatic changes (rainfall and temperature)
  4: Changes in rainfall, specifically reductions; High temperatures exacerbating
    low runoff; Low proportion of irrigated land.
  5: Failure of governments and aid agencies to invest in irrigation; lack of private
    investment due to African climate; changes in rainfall patterns; high evapotranspiration
    rates in Sub-Saharan Africa; desertification reducing vegetative productivity;
    land-atmosphere feedback mechanisms decreasing precipitation.
  7: Climatic changes impacting agricultural production.
  8: Rainfall and temperature as climatic factors affecting agricultural production.
  11: Rainfall and temperature changes
  12: Changes in mean rainfall.
  14: Rainfall and temperature variations; specifically, decreases in rainfall and
    increases in temperature
  15: Climatic changes, specifically rainfall and temperature variations.
Highlights:
  1: Climate has been a major determinant of agricultural production in Sub-Sahara
    Africa (SSA).
  2: The paper proposes climate change as an overlooked factor potentially contributing
    to poor agricultural performance in Sub-Saharan Africa.
  3: Agricultural production in SSA countries has been sensitive to climatic changes
    in the latter half of the 20th century, while no such effects are found for non-SSA
    developing countries.
  4: Sub-Saharan African agricultural production is particularly sensitive to climatic
    changes due to variable water availability, low runoff, and limited irrigation.
  5: Rainfall variability and desertification in Africa drive precautionary savings,
    reducing potential investment and impacting agricultural production.
  10: Results should be viewed as the net impact of climate change on agricultural
    output, rather than the full impact on the agricultural sector.
  11: Agricultural production has been rising for both SSA and NSSA, but NSSA rose
    proportionally more from mid 1970s to mid 1980s; Temperature trends are similar
    across both groups, increasing drastically from the late 1970s onwards; Rainfall
    trends differ, being relatively steady in NSSA but peaking in SSA in the 1960s
    and declining thereafter.
  12: Rainfall is not a significant determinant of agricultural output.
  14: Lower rainfall has kept agricultural production below what it would have been
    if the long-term mean had prevailed, especially during the 1980s. The increase
    in temperature has a relatively modest impact compared to the drop in rainfall.
  15: Climatic changes have had important effects on total agricultural output in
    Sub-Saharan Africa, but not in other developing countries.
Methodology:
  1: Uses a new cross-country panel climatic dataset in an agricultural production
    framework.
  2: The analysis suggests climatic changes as a potential factor affecting agriculture
    but does not outline a specific method or timeframe applicable for results.
  3: "Empirically examine how climatic changes have affected Africa\u2019s agricultural\
    \ production within a production function framework, using a new cross-country\
    \ climatic change data set in conjunction with agricultural output and input data."
  7: "Specifies a simple empirical production function: log(Yit) = \u03B21 + \u03B2\
    2 log(Lit) + \u03B23 log(Ait) + \u03B24 log(Fit) + \u03B25 log(Kit) + \u03B26\
    \ log(Mit), where Y is agricultural output and L, A, F, K, and M are inputs."
  8: Fixed effects estimator used to account for unobserved country-specific effects;
    data derived from IPCC for rainfall and temperature from 1901 to 1998 across 289
    countries.
  9: Livestock is proxied by the total head count of cattle, sheep, and goats.
  10: Acknowledges the limitation of the production function approach in not fully
    accounting for compensatory responses to climate change by farmers.
  11: Panel data analysis with 40 SSA and 67 NSSA countries; Five-point moving averages
    are used for climatic proxies in figures.
  12: Empirical estimation of an unspecified equation (1) relating agricultural output
    to inputs (fertilizer, tractors, agricultural land area) and rainfall, performed
    separately for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Non-Sub-Saharan Africa (NSSA) countries.
  14: The paper uses cross-country data on rainfall to investigate the sensitivity
    of Sub-Saharan African agriculture to climate change, constructing hypothetical
    series of agricultural production with constant rainfall and temperature. The
    model includes observed values and estimated coefficients of climatic change indicators.
More Notes:
  1: The study compares Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) and non-Sub-Sahara Africa (NSSA) developing
    countries.
  2: The section sets the stage for considering climate change as an important variable
    in understanding challenges faced by African agriculture, but does not yet provide
    detailed analysis or data.
  3: The paper attempts to fill the gap in research on the effects of climate change
    on agricultural production in the African context as a whole.
  4: This section primarily relies on IPCC (2001) unless otherwise indicated.
  9: The choice of inputs was constrained by the availability of comparable cross-country
    data across sub-Saharan African and other developing countries over a sufficient
    time span.
  10: The authors mention the Ricardian approach as an alternative but lack the necessary
    data to implement it.
  11: The panel data is unbalanced. Rescaling inputs (L, K, F) by agricultural area
    shows that NSSA nations use these more intensively per unit of land than SSA counterparts.
  12: The analysis suggests a possible link between climatic changes and differences
    in agricultural output between SSA and NSSA, but this specific page focuses on
    an empirical investigation that finds rainfall not to be a significant determinant.
  14: The model appears to focus on agricultural production as the primary outcome
    of interest. It does not directly analyze broader macroeconomic or fiscal implications.
  15: "The paper suggests policy makers take steps to lower African agricultural sector\u2019\
    s sensitivity to rainfall variations, such as improving irrigation and crop grazing\
    \ areas."
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Total agricultural production
  2: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes are directly analyzed in this section.
  3: Agricultural production
  4: Agricultural production is sensitive to climatic changes; Runoff is sensitive
    to changes in rainfall.
  5: Potential investment is diverted to precautionary savings due to rainfall changes,
    impacting long-term growth.
  7: Agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa relative to other developing countries.
  8: Agricultural output related to climatic factors.
  11: Agricultural production
  12: Agricultural production index (as a proxy for macroeconomic performance).
  14: Agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
  15: Total agricultural output in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Quantitative material:
  1: The detrimental changes in climate since the 1960s can account for a substantial
    portion of the gap in agricultural production between SSA and the rest of the
    developing world.
  2: No quantitative information on the outcomes of interest is presented on this
    page.
  3: Agricultural production in SSA countries has indeed been sensitive to climatic
    changes that have taken place in the latter half of the 20th century. In contrast,
    no such effects are found for non-SSA developing countries.
  4: Average runoff in SSA is about 15%; A 10% reduction in precipitation in Southern
    Africa could lead to a fall of more than 50% in runoff (from Reibsame 1989); Less
    than 10% of arable land in SSA is irrigated.
  5: "Desertification has reduced the potential vegetative productivity by 25 per\
    \ cent for nearly a quarter of Africa\u2019s land area."
  11: Summary statistics for variables (including L, K, and F rescaled by agricultural
    area); Mean values across SSA and NSSA of agricultural production and climatic
    change measure over the sample period, normalized by initial levels; Timeframe
    is 1961-1997 (but rainfall and temperature trends are from the 20th century).
  12: R-squared values for the models; comparison of coefficients for fertilizer,
    tractors, and agricultural land area between SSA and NSSA countries.
  14: The increase in temperature had a relatively modest impact (compared to the
    drop in rainfall) on agricultural production in SSA. If climatic conditions had
    been similar on average to the first part of the century, one would have observed
    only about 32 per cent of the increase in the gap of agricultural production between
    SSA and NSSA groups.
  15: If rainfall and temperatures had remained at pre-1960s levels, only 32% of the
    agricultural production gap between Sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries
    would have been observed by the end of the 20th century.
