Drivers of Risk:
  4: Water availability (P/PET)
  5: Increasing aridity due to continued greenhouse gas emissions (RCP 8.5) across
    many dryland regions globally. Regions include parts of North and South America,
    West and Southern Africa, Southern Europe, Central Asia, and Australia. Some regions
    like East Africa, South and East Asia, Siberia and Alaska may experience net increases
    in water availability.

Highlights:
  4: Carbon stocks in global drylands increase with increasing water availability
    (P/PET). Drylands hold a significant portion of global carbon stocks, with the
    all drylands carbon stock accounting for 29.7% of the global carbon stock.
  10: No relevant information
Methodology:
  4: The analysis uses local polynomial regression fitting for datasets shown in Figure
    2 to determine the average and variability in carbon stocks based on P/PET. The
    estimates are summarizing data from figure 2 for the aridity zones identified
    in figure 1. Biomass analyses are derived from data on above-ground wood and below-ground
    root biomass, with modelled/calibrated estimates of average carbon in herbaceous
    vegetation. Soil organic carbon estimates are for the top 30 cm of soil.
  5: Climate model inter-comparison project (CMIP5) using 22 GCMs and the RCP 8.5
    scenario. Analysis covers projections to 2076-2100 relative to 2006-2025.

More Notes:
  4: P/PET is used as a proxy for water availability.
  5: The analysis highlights regional differences in climate change trajectories,
    presenting both challenges and opportunities for carbon sequestration. It notes
    divergent responses to climate change between tropical, temperate, and arctic
    drylands.
  10: This page primarily contains bibliographic references. The paper itself is focused
    on drylands and carbon neutrality, but this specific page does not present specific
    findings on macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, costs, or benefits of adaptation
    at a national level.
No relevant information:
  1: This page primarily focuses on the role of drylands in the global carbon cycle
    and their response to climate change, without providing specific macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes, quantitative estimates of costs/benefits of adaptation, or
    details on national-level impacts.

Quantitative material:
  4: Estimates of total carbon (C) in global drylands for different aridity zones
    (Hyperarid, Arid, Semiarid, Dry subhumid) are provided in petagrams of carbon
    (Pg C). These estimates include aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, and
    soil organic matter. Total carbon for All drylands is estimated at 1,811.5 Pg
    C. The data also contains estimates for humid and global terrestrial systems.
  5: Change in aridity (P/PET) projected for 2076-2100 relative to 2006-2025 (Figure
    4 - description provided separately).
