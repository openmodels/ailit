Drivers of Risk:
  1: Herbicides during the Vietnam War, conversion to aquaculture, and coastal development
    led to mangrove loss and degradation.
  2: Impacts of climate change, sea level rise, changes to sediment budgets as a result
    of the increase in hydropower station on major river course.
  17: No relevant information
  19: Conversion of mangroves to aquaculture, deforestation, and river damming
  20: Conflict between economic development (shrimp aquaculture) and conservation;
    unplanned development of shrimp farming areas; rapid growth of aquaculture industry
    combined with land and market reforms; local misappropriation of the benefits
    of these reforms.
  28: Sea level rise; Coastal storms; Landslides; Coastal erosion
  29: Incomplete and incoherent policies, laws, and regulations governing mangroves
    in Vietnam; administrative conflict between MONRE and MARD; Vietnamese government
    policies encouraged development and aquaculture in mangrove areas for short-term
    economic gains; weak collaboration between MARD and MONRE.
  33: No relevant information
  35: Impacts of sea level rise exacerbated by land subsidence and groundwater extraction
    in the Mekong delta.
  36: Losses of mangroves; climate change.
  39: Sea level rise adversely affects mangroves due to changes in duration and frequency
    of inundation and alterations in salinity levels.
  41: Land subsidence in the Mekong Delta due to groundwater extraction exacerbating
    sea level rise.
Highlights:
  1: Vietnamese mangroves provide coastal protection from storm events but have been
    significantly degraded due to human activities.
  17: Mangroves in Vietnam protect more people (8 million) from flooding than in any
    other nation.
  19: Mangrove forests provide income from aquatic resources (timber, firewood, charcoal,
    tannin, food, medicinal resources) and serve as breeding grounds for marine organisms,
    supporting local livelihoods. Mangrove-shrimp farming systems are popular in the
    Mekong Delta.
  28: Mangrove rehabilitation as a strategy for soft climate change adaptation, particularly
    for mitigating sea level rise and coastal storms.
  29: Administrative conflicts and policy incoherence hinder mangrove restoration
    efforts in Vietnam. Financial resources for mangrove conservation are inadequate.
    Payments for ecosystem services (PES) are mentioned as a potential solution to
    overcome financial limitations for mangrove conservation.
  33: Community-based mangrove rehabilitation programmes, funded mainly by Japanese
    organizations in the northern coast of Vietnam has been found to be successful
    in some areas.
  35: Mangroves have potential resilience due to species diversity, and bamboo breakwaters
    can mitigate wave energy.
  36: Mangrove restoration is an important strategic option for coastal management;
    Vietnamese mangroves store globally significant amounts of carbon.
  39: Vietnamese coasts are one of the hotspots vulnerable to a future sea level rise
    due to a low tidal range and lower sediment output (excluding the Mekong and Red
    River deltas).
Methodology:
  2: Studies using remote sensing techniques
  17: No relevant information
  19: No relevant information
  28: Case study measuring the impact and cost-benefit of mangrove plantation in Vietnam,
    focusing on community-based projects since 1994
  33: Case studies on Kien Giang mangroves suggest the use of a combination of Melaleuca
    fences together with reforested mangroves for efficient coastal protection.
More Notes:
  2: The paper focuses on Vietnamese mangroves, particularly in Can Gio, Ca Mau and
    Red River Delta.
  17: This page focuses on the ecological and social benefits of mangroves in Vietnam,
    mentioning their role in coastal protection, habitat provision, and livelihood
    support, but it doesn't delve into the macroeconomic or macro-fiscal aspects beyond
    the value of property protected.
  19: The paper highlights the importance of mangroves for coastal protection, livelihood
    improvement, and biodiversity, and points to the significant loss of mangroves
    in Vietnam due to various anthropogenic factors.
  20: The Vietnamese government is trying to balance economic development with mangrove
    conservation, but the aquaculture industry has undermined mangrove goods and services.
  29: The paper highlights the potential of Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES)
    mechanisms (carbon sequestration, storm/flood protection, aquaculture support)
    as a means to finance mangrove conservation, but it acknowledges the uncertainty
    regarding whether PES can fully compensate for lost profits.
  33: Local communities were not adequately compensated for reduced access to crabs
    and clams in the Red River Delta as these regions were given a special protective
    status.
  39: Mangrove degradation was accelerated by the Vietnam War and subsequent unplanned
    shrimp farming and illegal logging, due to a lack of regulatory mechanisms.
  41: The page highlights the difficulty in predicting the future of mangroves in
    Vietnam due to patchy data on mangrove cover, environmental status, and species
    distribution. It suggests developing a combined database for Vietnamese mangroves
    and leveraging the Global Mangrove Database Information System (GLOMIS) for research
    and data collection.

    benefits of adaptation at a national level.
  14: This page focuses on mangrove loss and erosion in the Ca Mau region of Vietnam
    due to aquaculture, deforestation, and dam construction. It does not explicitly
    discuss macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, costs, benefits, or adaptation
    strategies at a national level.
  37: This page primarily discusses observed climate trends and potential impacts
    on mangrove ecosystems in Vietnam. It does not provide any information about macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal outcomes, nor does it quantify the costs or benefits of adaptation

    and large amounts of carbon in Vietnam (765-1026 MgC/ha).
