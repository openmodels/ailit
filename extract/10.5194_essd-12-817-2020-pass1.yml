Drivers of Risk:
  1: The paper does not directly address specific climate change drivers of risk on
    this page. It focuses on developing a methodology for estimating asset exposure,
    which is a component of risk assessment alongside hazard and vulnerability.
  4: Exposure data relates to direct impacts on tangible structures; nonfinancial
    wealth as an approximation.

Evaluation overview:
  1: The paper evaluates the disaggregation skill of the LitPop method for estimating
    subnational gross domestic product (GDP) by comparing it to reported gross regional
    product (GRP) values.
  2: GDP and GRP are used to evaluate the methodology by assessing the subnational
    disaggregation skill for varied combinations.

  13: This page focuses on evaluating different exponent combinations used in asset
    exposure data for global physical risk assessment. It does not directly evaluate
    climate change impacts like mortality or productivity loss, but rather the quality
    of the underlying asset exposure data.

Highlights:
  1: LitPop offers global consistency, scalability, openness, replicability, and a
    low entry threshold. The combination of nightlight and population data improves
    the spatial distribution of macroeconomic indicators compared to using either
    data type alone. The data is available for 224 countries.
  2: The LitPop methodology is published on GitHub as part of the open-source event-based
    probabilistic impact model CLIMADA.
  6: "For the Pearson correlation coefficient (\u03C1), Lit1Pop1 shows the best overall\
    \ median of \u03C1 (0.94) with the lowest interquartile range (IQR) of 0.09."
  7: Disaggregation proportional to Lit1Pop1 can be considered the most adequate combination
    of Lit and Pop for the subnational downscaling of GDP.
  8: The LitPop methodology allows for the creation of globally consistent and spatially
    highly resolved estimates of gridded asset exposure value.
  9: LitPop performs well in GDP disaggregation at the subnational level, with Lit1Pop1
    selected for best absolute deviation performance.
  10: The approach allows estimation for any target year at various resolutions based
    on data availability, with specific adaptations for countries lacking data.
  11: The asset exposure data are not suitable for applications with a local or sector-specific
    focus without further validation.

  13: "The table provides a quantitative comparison of how well different exponent\
    \ combinations fit the data for different countries based on \u03C1, \u03B2, and\
    \ RMSF. The data is statistically significant with p<0.05."
  14: "The study compares different methods of spatially disaggregating asset exposure\
    \ values, using nightlight intensity and population count, and evaluates these\
    \ methods using skill metrics such as correlation (\u03C1), beta (\u03B2), and\
    \ root-mean-square fraction (RMSF)."
Methodology:
  2: Disaggregates national total asset values to obtain a gridded asset exposure
    product. Physical asset stock values are disaggregated proportionally to a digital
    number computed from nightlight intensity and population data per grid cell.
  3: The analysis disaggregates total asset value and GDP per country to grid-level
    data using gridded nightlight and population data.
  4: Produced capital values from 140 countries used for asset exposure; for 87 other
    countries, nonfinancial wealth derived from GDP and GDP-to-wealth ratios.
  5: GDP is disaggregated to grid level, re-aggregated to model GRP, and compared
    to reference values to compute skill metrics.
  6: "The LitPop methodology is applied to compute gridded asset exposure data for\
    \ 224 countries and areas worldwide, using exponents m=n=1. Reported GRP data\
    \ for 507 regions in 14 countries is used to evaluate the model's ability to disaggregate\
    \ national GDP to subnational regions. Skill metrics, including Pearson correlation\
    \ coefficient (\u03C1), slope of linear regression (\u03B2), and root-mean-squared\
    \ fraction (RMSF), are computed to assess the disaggregation skill. Ten combinations\
    \ of m and n in LitmPopn were assessed: Lit1Pop1, Lit1, Lit2, Lit3, Lit4, Lit5,\
    \ Pop1, Pop2, Lit2Pop1, and Lit3Pop1."
  7: National total asset values were disaggregated proportional to the distribution
    of Lit1Pop1 for 224 countries and areas, scaled to a resolution of 600 arcsec
    (underlying gridded data is 30 arcsec ~ 1km).
  8: The LitPop methodology is used to disaggregate GDP to create spatially resolved
    estimates of gridded asset exposure value. It relies on globally available data
    like nightlights and population.
  9: The analysis involves evaluating disaggregation skill by correlating GDP and
    GRP as indirect measures due to lack of subnational asset value data.
  10: The methodology allows for disaggregation proportional to socioeconomic indicators
    and can be modified to include alternative data sources.
  11: Asset exposure data are estimated globally with consistency, flexibility, and
    openness, integrated into the CLIMADA repository, for use in economic disaster
    risk modeling and climate change adaptation studies. The evaluation was limited
    to GDP in 14 OECD countries.
  12: The paper uses GRP data from various national and international statistical
    offices, as accessed in January/February 2019, to estimate asset exposure. The
    data pertains to different years, ranging from 2012 to 2017, depending on the
    country.
  13: "The analysis compares different exponent combinations using linear correlation\
    \ (\u03C1) and RMSF. Statistical significance is assessed with a p-value lower\
    \ than 0.05. Best fit is determined by \u03C1=1, \u03B2=1, and RMSF=1."
  14: Asset exposure value is spatially distributed proportionally to nightlight intensity
    of 2016 and population count as of 2015.
More Notes:
  1: The asset exposure data resulting from the methodology is publicly available
    in the ETH Research Repository. The code is published on GitHub as part of the
    CLIMADA software. The paper addresses the challenge of limited availability of
    asset exposure data at the global scale.
  6: 'GRP is normalized to ensure comparability of skill metrics between different
    countries using the equation: nGRPi=GRPi/GDP.'
  7: Nightlight intensity data can misrepresent actual value distribution, especially
    in urban areas, due to saturation and blooming.
  8: The disaggregation skill evaluation is limited to 14 OECD countries. The Mexico
    example illustrates limitations, particularly in highly centralized countries
    like Mexico City, where the disaggregation approach fails to accurately reproduce
    reference nGRP for the capital metropolitan region.
  11: Future research could integrate higher resolution population data and ancillary
    data sources for validation against subnational asset value and empirical asset
    stock inventories to improve accuracy. Regional validation could inform the choice
    of the most appropriate downscaling functionality for different income groups
    and world regions.
  12: The table lists the countries included in the study, the number of administrative
    regions (level 1) within each country, their World Bank income group in 2016,
    and the source of the Gross Regional Product (GRP) data used. The URLs provided
    show where the data was accessed.
  14: The paper evaluates how well different proxies (nightlights and population)
    correlate with nGRP data, but the actual nGRP data itself or the implications
    of the nGRP data for the National Climate Assessment are not specified.
