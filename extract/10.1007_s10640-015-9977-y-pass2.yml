Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in climatic conditions through short-term variation and medium-term changes
    in average regional temperatures and precipitation.
  2: Climate change impacts (temperature and precipitation changes, extreme weather
    events), gradual climate disruption, weather variations, permanent climate shifts,
    loss of permafrost and methane release.
  3: Changes in temperature and precipitation.
  4: Rising temperatures; pests expanding northward and eastward; heat waves; need
    for cooling in the warm season will increase.
  5: Increasing average temperatures and precipitation in Russia, as well as potential
    for increased frequency of extreme weather events (forest and peat fires, flooding,
    land erosion, public health challenges).
  9: Annual weather variation and changes in long-term climate (temperature and precipitation).
  11: Weather or climate changes, specifically temperature.
  12: Weather and climate changes, particularly temperature and precipitation variations,
    are impacting regional economic factors.
  14: Temperature and precipitation variables, regional industrial growth rate, dependency
    ratios (underage and overage populations), population density, share of public
    houses in total regional housing stock, and regional share of the Communist Party
    vote in Duma elections.
  15: Annual (lagged) temperature, precipitation
  17: Temperature increases. Precipitation is relevant for housing expenditures.
  18: Temperature and precipitation changes (climate change scenarios), population
    density, age dependency ratios (Overage and Underage), communist history, industrial
    growth, and public housing.
  19: Temperature change due to climate scenarios A2 and B1
  20: Changes in temperature and precipitation
  23: Growing Degree Days (Growing DD), Precipitation, Heating Degree Days (Heating
    DD), Cooling Degree Days (Cooling DD), Temperature.
Highlights:
  1: An increase in temperature results in a decrease in public expenditures, and
    the magnitude of this effect diminishes the warmer the region. Benefits from warming
    accumulate and adaptation measures could help leverage those benefits.
  2: This study is an early step in filling the research gap in econometric analysis
    of public adaptation costs of climate change.
  3: Temperature rise reduces regional government expenditures in cold regions, particularly
    housing and communal expenditures. Warming tends to have a larger medium-term
    effect on decreasing regional government expenditures than in the short term.
  4: Temperatures in Russia have been rising faster than the global average; expected
    climate change impacts for Russia are versatile.
  5: Some Russian scientists believe Russia is a net winner from climate change. GAIN's
    (2012) climate change vulnerability ranking indicates Russia is 39th most susceptible
    out of some 180 countries surveyed, suggesting serious challenges.
  11: Expenditures seem to have the most robust fit with the first lag of the temperature
    variable. Housing expenditures are a potential channel for impacts of temperature
    changes on regional budget expenditures.
  12: The main focus is on how temperature and precipitation data are collected and
    calculated for Russian regions, as well as the robustness check with degree days
    for agricultural and energy use impacts.
  14: "Weather variables are highly robust in FE models and quite strongly robust\
    \ for the long-difference estimation with respect to signi\uFB01cance and coef\uFB01\
    cients."
  15: A rise in temperature decreases regional expenditures in colder regions, while
    the effect approaches zero or even reverses in warmer regions; Non-linear analysis
    confirms the decreasing impact of warming on expenditures, but the effect is smaller
    than linear models suggest.
  17: Temperature has a cumulative effect on total expenditures, with the longer-run
    coefficient being significantly larger than the short-term estimate. The FE model
    likely underestimates the temperature effect when adaptation and intensification
    come into play.
  18: Temperature has a statistically significant negative impact on total expenditures
    in the full data and cut tails models. Precipitation has a statistically significant
    negative impact on housing expenditures in the cut tails model. Industrial growth
    has a statistically significant positive impact on total expenditures in both
    models.
  19: Climate change (warming) is predicted to lead to small savings in Russian regional
    government expenditures in the 2020s, but the benefits are quite small compared
    to Russia's consolidated regional budget expenditures
  20: A rise in temperature reduces regional public expenditures in cold regions,
    becomes negligible in warmer regions, and reverses in the hottest regions (non-linear
    effect).
  23: Heating Degree Days have a statistically significant positive impact on Total
    Expenditures. Temperature has a statistically significant negative impact on Total
    Expenditures. Precipitation has a statistically significant negative impact on
    Housing Expenditures.
Methodology:
  1: "Uses a rich sub-national dataset for Russia covering 1995\u20132009 to estimate\
    \ the impacts of changes in climatic conditions."
  2: Econometric analysis of public adaptation costs of climate change using sub-national
    data for Russia. Focuses on moderate changes in temperature and precipitation
    effects on regional government expenditure. Aims to proxy for climate change impacts
    using temperature and rainfall.
  3: Analysis of annual data from 1995 to 2009 to analyze changes in regional government
    expenditure across 78 Russian regions. The results concern climate change with
    respect to changes in temperature and precipitation.
  8: The analysis uses a fixed-effects (FE) model to estimate climate impacts on regional
    expenditures based on annual temperature and precipitation variations, along with
    control variables; regional fixed effects control for time-invariant unobserved
    variables, and time dummies control for country-wide trends.
  9: The paper employs a fixed effects (FE) model to identify the effects of climate
    change through annual weather variation, acknowledging its limitations in capturing
    adaptation. It also uses a long-difference (LD) model, comparing averages of weather
    variables between two distinct time periods (1995-2001 and 2002-2009 for this
    study of Russia).
  10: Acknowledges the possibility of spatial autocorrelation and its potential impact
    on standard errors and inference.
  11: Panel data analysis with fixed effects (FE) model and long difference (LD) model.
    Driscoll and Kraay standard errors are used in the FE model to account for spatial
    and temporal dependence. Heteroskedasticity robust standard errors are used for
    the LD model.
  12: "Analysis is performed using climate data from Russian regions between 1995\u2013\
    2009, accounting for annual average temperature and precipitation, and robustness\
    \ is checked with higher frequency climate variables like GDD, HDD, and CDD."
  14: Fixed effects (FE) models and long-difference estimation are used. Robustness
    checks are performed on covariate selection.
  15: Fixed effects estimates with linear and quadratic models, robustness check with
    data where 5% from both tails of the temperature and precipitation variables are
    removed; Population-weighted average effect of regional effects to obtain nationwide
    effect
  17: The paper uses both a Fixed Effects (FE) model and a Long Difference (LD) model
    to estimate the impact of temperature and precipitation on regional government
    expenditures. The FE model captures short-term adaptation (within a year), while
    the LD model attempts to account for longer-run adaptation. The LD model results
    are presented with caution due to data limitations. They also used degree day
    variables as a robustness check.
  18: Long-difference (LD) estimations with full data and data excluding 5% of both
    tails from temperature and precipitation variables, using robust standard errors.
    Data from 1995-1999 to 2020s.
  19: Calculated regional temperature predictions and multiplied these with the regional
    temperature gradients to get regional impact estimates; used Russia's regional
    government expenditures in 2000, inflated to 2013 prices
  20: The short-term approach gives a no-adaptation benchmark effect, while the mid-term
    approach captures potential adaptation better.
  23: Long-difference estimations (Table 6) and fixed effects estimations (Table 7)
    are used to analyze the impact of climate change on regional government expenditures.
    Table 6 uses temperature degree days and precipitation as variables. Table 7 uses
    temperature and precipitation directly. Models include control variables (unspecified
    on this page, but mentioned as being the same as in Table 3).
More Notes:
  1: The relation between regional budget expenditures and temperature is non-linear.
  2: The study focuses on sub-national data for Russia due to its large size and climatic
    heterogeneity.
  3: Russia is considered a useful benchmark due to its size, versatile climate, and
    significant public sector.
  4: The paper excludes the Chukotka region and Chechnya Republic from the analysis
    due to data issues.
  5: Permafrost thaw poses a catastrophic risk to Russian infrastructure and could
    lead to increased methane emissions, exacerbating climate change.
  9: The LD model is chosen to tackle adaptation and omitted variable problems and
    capture medium-term impacts of climate change.
  11: Data spans 1995-2009 for Russian regions. The analysis deflates regional expenditure
    figures with regional consumer price indices (cpi).
  12: The exclusion of certain regions (Chechnya and Chukotka) due to data unreliability
    and political peculiarities is noted, and averaging methods across weather stations
    are explained.
  14: The study uses data from Russia at the regional level from 1995-2009, focusing
    on the impact of weather and other control variables on regional public expenditure.
  15: The causality of the Communist Party variable is unclear; There is a strong
    negative correlation (-0.58) between regional income per capita and support of
    the Communist Party.
  17: The LD model results suggest that in regions of greater temperature increase,
    expenditures have increased less. The authors acknowledge potential unobserved
    trends or non-fixed variables that might affect the LD model results. Precipitation
    is significant for housing expenditures, while temperature is not.
  18: The analysis uses simplistic proxies for climate change (temperature and precipitation)
    and discusses results in the context of climate change scenarios using the GAEZ
    database and HadCM3 climate prediction model. The study focuses on Russia.
  19: The analysis only provides estimates up to the 2020s, as temperatures are expected
    to continue to increase and benefits from warming become increasingly uncertain
  20: The results cannot account for a large increase in temperature, which would
    likely have a dramatic effect through e.g. thawing of the permafrost.
  23: The analysis includes variations with full data and data excluding 5% of both
    tails from temperature and precipitation variables. Statistical significance is
    indicated by asterisks (*, **, ***).

Quantitative material:
  1: "Russia saves roughly USD 3\u20134 billion in regional government expenditures\
    \ between 2000 and the 2020s without undertaking adaptation measures, depending\
    \ on the scenario, for a mild temperature increase (1\u20132 \u25E6 C)."
  2: No quantitative information on nation-wide outcomes presented on this page.
  3: Temperature rise over the short term reduces regional government expenditures
    in cold regions. Russia saves between just over USD 2 billion to USD 4 billion
    in regional government expenditures between 2000 and the 2020s without any adaptation
    measures under a mild warming scenario.
  4: "Average annual temperature in Russia increased by 1.29 \xB0C during the last\
    \ roughly one hundred years; global warming for the same period was 0.74 \xB0\
    C; warming in Russia was +1.33 \xB0C for the period 1976\u20132006."
  5: "Figure 2 shows annual temperature deviations compared to the 1951\u20131980\
    \ average, presented as a 10-year moving average for Russia and the world, ranging\
    \ from -1 to 1.5 degrees Celsius"
  9: "The average Russian temperature has risen by 0.4 \xB0C between the periods 1995-2001\
    \ and 2002-2009. Precipitation has increased by an average of 8.4 mm during the\
    \ same period."
  11: Correlation between average temperature and share of public ownership is -0.44.
  12: No direct quantitative outcomes are provided on this page.
  14: The paper runs regressions with data where 5% of observations are removed from
    both tails of the temperature and precipitation variables.
  15: 1 degree Celsius increase leads to a roughly 3% decrease in regional expenditures
    per capita (linear model, full data); Nationwide coefficient of -0.026 (2.6% decline
    per one degree increase) with full data and -0.015 with cut data for total expenditures;
    Savings in housing expenditures due to warming become net costs at around an average
    regional temperature of 4 degrees Celsius.
  17: "A +1 \xB0C increase in regional average temperature leads to a decrease of\
    \ roughly a third in real expenditures per capita (based on the LD model, which\
    \ the authors caution is likely an overestimate). The longer-run temperature coefficient\
    \ is ten times larger in absolute sense than the short-term FE estimate."

    population density, age dependency ratios, communist history, industrial growth,
    and public housing on total expenditures and housing expenditures using long-difference
    estimations.
  19: Under the B1 scenario, Russian regional governments save between USD 2 billion
    and USD 4 billion (in real terms, non-discounted) between 2000 and the 2020s due
    to warming; Under the A2 scenario, savings range between USD 2 billion to roughly
    USD 3.5 billion over the period
  20: Warming effects are estimated to save Russian regional governments over USD
    2 billion to USD 4 billion in expenditures between 2000 and the 2020s.
