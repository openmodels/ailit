Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate variability
  28: No relevant information
  32: The graph covers the period 1992-2007, but does not specify the risks driving
    catch size or landing proportion. Climate change *could* be a driver.
  33: The diagram does not explicitly mention climate change; however, the model implicitly
    considers that climate change could impact the tuna fishing industry (e.g. impacts
    on catch, availability of fishing inputs).
  34: Direct effects, Induced effects, and Indirect effects are listed as drivers,
    though the context is not specified; these appear to relate to expenditure.
Highlights:
  28: No relevant information
  33: The analysis seeks to understand how initial expenditure in the tuna fishing
    sector cascades through the economy, highlighting potential leakages (rest of
    the world, savings) that reduce the multiplier effect.
  34: Expenditure and 'Coef. of induction' trends are presented alongside 'Direct
    effects', 'Induced effects', and 'Indirect effects'.
Methodology:
  1: The study is presented as a preprint.
  28: No relevant information
  33: The diagram suggests an input-output or multiplier analysis approach, tracking
    monetary flows within the economy.
  34: The analysis tracks expenditure and a 'Coef. of induction' over time, attributing
    expenditure to 'Direct effects', 'Induced effects', and 'Indirect effects'. The
    applicability is limited to the 1992-2006 period shown.
More Notes:
  1: This is a preprint from 2009, suggesting the information may be outdated.
  33: The diagram appears to present a simplified circular flow model specific to
    the tuna fishing industry in Victoria, rather than a general economy-wide model
    for climate change adaptation. The 'risk' here could be related to the vulnerability
    of the fishing sector to changes that affect its productivity and profitability.
  34: MSR 2001 is not explained. The dependent variable of the underlying regressions
    is not specified. The units of expenditure are not specified.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Impacts on the tuna economy of Seychelles
  28: No relevant information
  32: Catch (t), Landings/transhipment (t), Proportion (likely related to landings/transhipment).
    These are likely related to fishery productivity, which could have macroeconomic
    implications if the fishery sector is significant.
  33: This page outlines expenditure flows related to the tuna fishing fleet in Victoria,
    tracing how initial monetary injections lead to subsequent rounds of expenditure
    and leakages; it suggests an analysis focused on GDP or income effects through
    multiplier effects.
  34: Expenditure (MSR 2001) is tracked, alongside a 'Coef. of induction'.
Quantitative material:
  28: No relevant information
  32: Catch (t) ranges from approximately 100,000 to 450,000. Landings/transhipment
    (t) mirrors the catch, although it's not clear how they differ. Proportion ranges
    from 0 to 1.
  34: Expenditure (MSR 2001) is shown in a range from 0 to 600. 'Coef. of induction'
    is shown in a range from 0 to 2.5. Data is presented from 1992 to 2006.
