0,Runoff,Southern Africa,Unspecified,1989,Precipitation Reduced by 10%,%,-50,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Page 4,Estimated reduction in runoff due to a 10% decrease in precipitation. Reibsame (1989) is cited as the source.
1,Agricultural Production,SSA,Constant Rainfall,1970,Actual Rainfall,Percentage,-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14,Agricultural output is reduced relative to the real series until the 1970s.
2,Agricultural Production,SSA,Constant Rainfall,1980,Actual Rainfall,Percentage,-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14,"Low rainfall has kept agricultural production below what it would have been if the long-term mean had prevailed, culminating in the late 1980s when rainfall was at its lowest."
3,Agricultural Production Gap,SSA vs NSSA,Constant Climate,1998,Actual Climate Change,Percentage,-32,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14,"The result refers to a 32 percent *reduction* in the gap in agricultural production between the two country groups due to climate change. Note the negative sign reflects the impact on the gap itself, not agricultural production in isolation. The year is chosen since this is when their data ends."
4,Agricultural Production,Sub-Saharan Africa,Pre 1960s climate conditions,2000,Actual Climate,% of Production Gap,-32,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,p. 15,The 32% represents the reduction in the gap of agricultural production between Sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries if rainfall and temperatures had remained at their pre 1960s level.
