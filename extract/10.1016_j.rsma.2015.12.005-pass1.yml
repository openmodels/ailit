Drivers of Risk:
  3: Increasing temperatures, heat wave frequency, and ocean acidification. Degradation
    of seabed habitats, harmful blooms of algae and jellyfish. Rising CO2 levels.
  4: Climate change, ocean acidification, rapid warming, increase frequency of extreme
    weather events, rapid increase of human population around its coasts, human-induced
    CO2 emission
  15: Warming of the Mediterranean Sea; Ocean acidification.
  17: Elevated seawater temperature, ocean acidification, and invasion by non-indigenous
    algae species benefiting from increased CO2 and elevated temperature.
  19: Rising CO2 in the Mediterranean Sea.
  21: Ocean acidification and increased water temperatures, driven by global CO2 emissions.
  22: Increasing acidification and warming of the Mediterranean Sea.
  29: Ocean acidification; Climate modulation of fish populations (specifically sardine
    and anchovy) related to the Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO).
Highlights:
  3: Ocean acidification should be factored into fisheries and aquaculture management
    plans. Regular assessments of the likely socio-economic impacts are needed to
    build adaptive strategies.
  17: Calcifying corals, important for fish habitats, fisheries, tourism, and local
    economies, are vulnerable to ocean acidification. Malfunction of calcifying and
    non-calcifying habitats due to warming and acidification can lead to knock-on
    ecological effects, limiting biodiversity and functional diversity of ecosystems,
    and altering the sustenance of fish stocks.
  21: Future ocean acidification and increased water temperatures threaten the Mediterranean
    Sea and will negatively impact its biodiversity and productivity, affecting social
    and economic services.
  22: Economic losses may occur in the tourism sector due to acidification and warming.
    Policy makers need the costs/benefits of policy action versus inaction.
  29: Ocean acidification has socio-economic impacts in the Mediterranean Sea; Climate
    oscillations impact fish populations and production.
Methodology:
  22: Integrated economic valuation of key economic sectors beyond fisheries (such
    as tourism) is proposed to assess economic losses. The paper advocates for risk
    maps and risk analysis methods.
  29: Multivariate mixed models are used for open-ended contingent valuation data;
    Economic valuation techniques are applied to biodiversity and marine ecosystems.
More Notes:
  15: The paper focuses on the Mediterranean Sea, which may or may not be representative
    of the 'national level' required for your review depending on the country in question.
    It also discusses indirect effects such as changes to biodiversity, habitat loss
    and trophic web alteration.
  22: The paper emphasizes the need for adaptation measures in the fisheries and aquaculture
    sectors, especially in the southern Mediterranean. It stresses the importance
    of stakeholder involvement and public-private partnerships.
No relevant information:
  7: This page focuses on the ecological impacts of climate change, specifically changes
    in marine species distribution and the introduction of invasive species. It does
    not contain information on macroeconomic, macro-fiscal outcomes, or the costs
    and benefits of adaptation at a national level.
  12: This page focuses on the biological impacts of ocean acidification on shellfish,
    particularly oysters and mussels, with no direct connection to macroeconomic or
    macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Fisheries and aquaculture contribute to the economy of countries bordering the
    Mediterranean Sea and provide food and employment to coastal communities. Impacts
    to tourism may result from reduced coastal biodiversity.
  4: National income, economic value of fisheries and aquaculture
  15: Loss of productivity in the coastal area due to warming impacting small pelagic
    populations.
  17: Potential loss of fisheries due to damage to coral habitats, affecting local
    economies and recreational tourism.
  19: Socio-economic value of Mediterranean sea ecosystems, including ocean acidification
    impacts on ecosystem functioning and trophic web changes.
  21: Impact to key social and economic services in the Mediterranean region, including
    shellfish aquaculture, fisheries, and tourism.
  22: The economic value of losses incurred by increasing acidification and warming
    of the Mediterranean Sea in sectors like tourism, costs/benefits of policy action
    and inaction regarding mitigation and adaptation, impacts on fisheries and aquaculture
    sectors (dependence on seafood for protein and income).
  29: Socio-economic impacts of ocean acidification; Economic valuation of biodiversity;
    Willingness to pay for conservation of monk seals; Economic perspective on natural
    marine ecosystems.
Quantitative material:
  3: Employs ca 600,000 people.
  4: Fisheries and aquaculture in the Mediterranean Sea represent 1% of world landings,
    and 2% in terms of economic value; Aquaculture has quadrupled in production reaching
    20% of production in 2011; Pelagic fish account for 53% of the total Mediterranean
    catch (about 460,000 tonnes in 2011)
  22: No quantitative information is provided on specific macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes.
  29: Willingness to pay (WTP) for conservation is examined.
