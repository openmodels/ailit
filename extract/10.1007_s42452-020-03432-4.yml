  4: Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and temperature are the primary drivers impacting
    crop yields.
  5: Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, rising temperatures.
  6: Changes in atmospheric CO2 and temperature are examined for their effects on
    crop yields.

  14: Temperature data from Berkeley Earth, CO2 data from NOAA
  15: Political changes in countries such as Sudan, the Soviet Union and Ethiopia
    have likely had negative effects on crop yields.
  16: "Average annual level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; annual temperature\
    \ (\xB0C) in country i in year t."

  28: Weather extremes, such as droughts, and offer protection against pests, fungus,
    and disease; Higher yield crops currently grown in temperate latitudes are increasingly
    adapted to tropical conditions where hours of sunlight are shorter but temperatures
    higher.

  28: Discusses agricultural financial and environmental outcomes, crop yields, and

Highlights:
  4: The threat of food insecurity is overstated.
  5: Climate change may be a threat to food security. Greater concentration of atmospheric
    CO2 can result in a fertilization effect that increases crop yields, but yields
    will eventually fall as temperatures continue to rise.
  7: Temperatures in Africa are on average higher than those elsewhere.
  10: Climate change impacts food security ambiguously and varies among differing
    local climates. Developing countries are the least able to adapt to climate change,
    and their agricultural sectors are expected to be impacted more than those in
    developed countries. Developed countries can adjust agricultural output in response
    to climate change through irrigation, new crops, enhanced crop varieties, information
    technology, and improved farm management techniques.
  11: Global warming from 1981 to 2002 has offset some of the yield gains from technological
    advances and rising CO2; Climate impacts often exceeded 10% of the rate of yield
    change; If farmers adapted to the changed climate conditions, wheat, maize, and
    rice yields in temperate regions would increase as a result of higher temperatures,
    but production of maize and wheat would be adversely affected by higher temperatures
    in the tropics.
  12: Extends previous studies by considering temperature, CO2, technological advances,
    and other adaptations in regression models to present a clearer picture of future
    food security; examines the inferred impact of climate change on observed yield
    trends.
  17: For wheat, the coefficients on CO2 and temperature are positive and statistically
    significant, while those of the quadratic terms and interaction term are all negative
    and statistically significant.
  18: The marginal effects of CO2 and temperature on wheat yields exhibit diminishing
    returns, with the effect of CO2 on yields further diminishing at higher temperatures.
    The impact of CO2 on maize yields is weak.
  19: Soybean yields initially increase with CO2 and temperature but eventually decline
    due to negative quadratic and interaction terms. The effect of increased CO2 on
    rapeseed is ambiguous. Temperature has a positive correlation with rapeseed yield.
  20: Rice's relationship to temperature and CO2 is difficult to measure accurately
    using surface air temperature and country-invariant CO2 measures; CO2 fertilization
    is less effective at higher temperatures for Sorghum
  21: Temperature has a statistically significant positive effect on both rice and
    sorghum yields. The interaction between CO2 and temperature is also statistically
    significant for both crops. Rice has the most severe diminishing returns based
    on the interaction term. Tipping points are computed at which increased temperature
    or CO2 leads to falling crop yields.
  22: The paper presents equations for the marginal effects of CO2 and temperature
    on crop yield, crop by crop, and outlines a methodology to determine 'tipping
    points' for CO2 and temperature.
  23: The wheat yield tipping point based on temperature is the only statistically
    significant result; however, its economic significance is questioned.
  24: Higher CO2 concentrations generally result in higher peak yields for the studied
    crops, but yields decrease at higher temperatures. The effect of increasing CO2
    concentrations on yield differs between crops.
  25: Crop yields generally increase with higher CO2 levels up to a certain point,
    after which they plateau or decline. The optimal CO2 concentration and temperature
    vary for each crop.
  26: The negative impacts of global warming on food security are likely overstated
    as a result of overlooking CO2 as a determinant of crop yields.
  27: "The evidence regarding the impact of climate change on agriculture is a matter\
    \ of interpretation, dependent on which studies are chosen to support one\u2019\
    s viewpoint and how the evidence is presented."
  28: Technological changes will greatly improve the ability of agricultural producers
    to adapt to climate change; Only when the scope for technological improvements
    is ignored might global warming lead to famines and starvation in the future.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of country-level climate-crop yield relationships.
  4: A historical analysis on crop yield trends in 57 selected countries from 1961
    to 2013 is performed using a fixed-effects panel regression model. The model incorporates
    CO2 levels measured at Mauna Loa, Hawaii, weighted-average temperatures in each
    country, purchasing power parity adjusted gross domestic product (PPP GDP), and
    education levels measured by the Human Capital Index (HCI).
  6: The study examines the historical relationship between crop yields and climate
    variables such as atmospheric CO2 and temperature.
  7: Uses FAO crop yield data and Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST) data series
    (1961-2018) to analyze the response of yields to projected changes in atmospheric
    CO2 and temperature.
  10: Develops statistical methods to determine how past yields have responded to
    increases in atmospheric CO2 and climate/weather variables. The estimated relationships
    are then used to determine the yield response to changes in projected CO2 and
    temperatures (heat). Takes the development level of each country across periods
    into account and controls for its effect.
  11: Linear regressions using first differences in yield with climate variables as
    explanatory variables (Lobell and Field); panel analyses of maize, wheat, rice
    and soybean for all countries (Lobell et al. 2011); meta-analysis of observations
    from studies (Challinor et al. 2014)
  12: Regression models using historical crop yield data from the FAO, spatially-weighted
    temperatures, and interaction effects between CO2 and temperature at the country
    level for the period 1961-2013.
  14: Uses spatially-weighted, location-specific temperature data for large countries
    and national averages for smaller ones. Production-weighted temperatures are used
    for crops based on USDA production maps. Mauna Loa annual CO2 data is used, assuming
    uniform distribution across countries. Penn World Table (PWT) version 9.1 database
    is used for socio-demographic characteristics.
  15: "Uses PPP GDP calculated using the output-based approach and PWT\u2019s human\
    \ capital index (HCI) to control for education levels."
  16: Fixed effects panel regression model, utilizing variation across time periods
    within countries and between countries. Controls for time-invariant regressors
    excluded from the model.
  17: Fixed-effects model that utilizes both within - and across-country differences
    in weather. Regression equations developed in R and Stata.
  18: The analysis uses regression models to assess the impact of CO2 and temperature
    (and their squared terms and interaction) on crop yields. The models are run with
    different sets of controls (GDP per capita, human capital index). The sample consists
    of data from 46-51 countries.
  19: Regression analysis is performed on soybean and rapeseed yields with CO2, temperature,
    and their quadratic and interaction terms as predictors. Models control for GDP/capita
    and human capital in some specifications.
  20: Regression models are used to analyze the relationship between crop yields and
    temperature/CO2 levels.
  21: Regression analysis is performed on rice and sorghum yields using CO2, temperature,
    and their squared and interaction terms as predictors. Fully specified models
    (3) and (6) are used to calculate marginal effects, which are then evaluated at
    the average levels of CO2 and temperature. Tipping points are calculated by setting
    first-order partial derivatives to zero.
  22: Marginal effects are derived from regression models (columns 3 and 6 in Tables
    4, 5, and 6). Tipping points are estimated using averages computed from the regression
    models, with formulas provided to calculate these points for CO2 and Temperature.
  23: Surface air temperature data is used to analyze yield tipping points, though
    results are not always statistically significant due to methodology limitations.
  24: "The page presents graphical results showing the relationship between temperature\
    \ and crop yields at varying CO2 levels. The applicable range is temperatures\
    \ between -20\xB0C and 50\xB0C for CO2 concentrations between 300 ppm and 550\
    \ ppm."
  25: The analysis uses line graphs to illustrate the relationship between CO2 concentration
    and crop yield for different temperature scenarios. The applicability is specific
    to the crops and temperature ranges presented in the graphs.

  1: Working paper from the University of Victoria, focusing on resource economics
    and policy analysis. The image is irrelevant.
  3: This is just the title page of the paper, so the substantive content for the
    other categories is not present here.
  4: The study considers the interactive effects of CO2 and temperature, which tend
    to work in opposite directions, on crop yields.
  7: The continental average temperatures are spatially weighted by the top 20 producing
    countries for each crop, which may change from year to year.
  11: Lobell and Field did not consider the impact of CO2-fertilization and adaptation
    measures; Lobell et al. (2011) did not consider the impact of CO2 fertilization
    and other factors such as technological advances in their statistical models.
  12: Focuses on the top twenty producers of each crop.
  14: The assumption that atmospheric CO2 is uniformly distributed is noted as a strong
    assumption due to data limitations.
  15: The paper acknowledges limitations in using a rough approximation of crop production
    and national average temperatures, and in using annual temperature data that do
    not adequately consider growing seasons for various crops.
  16: Acknowledges limitations regarding different crop varieties and planting times,
    as well as the assumption of uniformly distributed CO2 levels.
  17: The study excludes solar radiation and precipitation due to data availability
    and potential endogeneity issues.
  18: The authors suggest that the effects of CO2 and temperature on wheat yields
    might be overstated in simpler regressions without controls for GDP per capita
    and human capital. Limited CO2 data may explain the weak results for maize.
  19: Addition of human capital control significantly reduces the estimated parameter
    on the linear CO2 term for soybeans. Results are from 45 countries for soybeans
    and 35 for rapeseed.
  21: The analysis controls for GDP per capita and human capital in some models. Table
    7 provides the equations for marginal effects.
  22: Underlined parameters are statistically insignificant at the 10% level. The
    functional forms for calculating CO2 and Temperature 'tipping points' are provided.
  23: Results indicate potential inconsistencies, such as incorrect signs of marginal
    effects for maize and rice, suggesting the need for further research.
  24: The text mentions a tipping point of 396.2 ppm for wheat yields, implying damages
    that are inconsistent with current crop yield realities.
  25: The paper suggests that soybean yields may be approaching a tipping point, beyond
    which positive CO2 effects diminish. The rapeseed graph has a CO2 concentration
    ranging from 0 to 1500 ppm, different from the other graphs.
  26: The paper suggests that global CO2 levels may not be a good proxy for crop-specific
    regional effects on crop yields.
  27: Future technological change remains the greatest unknown factor.
