Drivers of Risk:
  5: Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, rising global mean surface temperatures,
    adverse weather
  7: Projected changes in atmospheric CO2 and temperature.
  11: Higher temperatures influencing crop yields; changes in temperature, CO2, and
    precipitation affecting crop production.
  12: Temperature, CO2 levels, technological advances, and other adaptations.
  13: "Temperature (\xB0C) and CO2 (ppm)."
  14: Location-specific temperature, atmospheric CO2
  16: Average annual level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; Annual temperature
    in country i in year t; Socio-demographic control variables.
  18: CO2 concentration, Temperature
  19: CO2 levels, temperature
  21: CO2 levels, Temperature.
  22: "Changes in CO2 concentration and temperature (T) from its mean (T\u0305)."
  23: Changes in CO2 concentration and temperature.
  24: "Temperature (\xB0C) and CO2 concentration (ppm)."
  27: Increases in atmospheric CO2 and/or temperatures, heat
Highlights:
  11: Adaptation can potentially offset negative impacts on crop yields; Lobell et
    al. found climate changes were exerting a considerable drag on yield growth.
  12: Extends previous studies by considering temperature, CO2, technological advances,
    and other adaptations in regression models to present a clearer picture of future
    food security.
  13: The paper analyzes the impact of temperature and CO2 on crop yields across 57
    countries from 1961 to 2013. Top producers of one crop are likely top producers
    of others.
  18: Marginal effects of CO2 and temperature on wheat yields exhibit diminishing
    returns, with the effect of CO2 on yields further diminishing at higher temperatures.
    The impact of CO2 on maize yields is weak, although yields do increase with higher
    temperatures.
  19: Soybean yields initially increase with CO2 and temperature, but eventually decline
    due to negative quadratic and interaction effects. The effect of CO2 on rapeseed
    yield is ambiguous. Increased temperature is positively correlated with increased
    rapeseed yields.
  21: Temperature has a significant positive effect on both rice and sorghum yields.
    The interaction between CO2 and temperature is significant and negative for sorghum,
    suggesting a complex relationship between these factors. The marginal effects
    of temperature on crop yields have the a priori expected signs for each crop,
    with rice having the most severe diminishing returns based on the interaction
    term. Tipping points are calculated where increased temperatures or CO2 leads
    to falling crop yields.
  22: The table shows the marginal effect of CO2 and temperature on the yield of six
    crops. There is a functional form is specified for computing tipping points for
    both CO2 and Temperature.
  23: "Wheat yields have a statistically significant tipping point at 19.9\xB0C and\
    \ 396.2 ppm CO2. CO2 tipping points for soybean and sorghum are 416.7 ppm and\
    \ 670.9 ppm, respectively, although these results need to be investigated further.\
    \ The CO2 fertilization effect for rice is inconsistent with expectations, suggesting\
    \ a need for further research. The sign of the marginal CO2 effect for maize is\
    \ incorrect, likely due to lack of regional CO2 data."
  24: Crop yield response to temperature varies depending on the CO2 concentration.
    Generally, yield increases to a peak at a moderate temperature and declines at
    higher temperatures. The specific shape and peak differ for different crops and
    CO2 levels. For Maize, Rice, Rapeseed, and Wheat higher CO2 levels lead to generally
    higher yields, while for Soybean and Sorghum higher CO2 generally leads to lower
    yields.
  27: "The evidence regarding the impact of climate change on agriculture is a matter\
    \ of interpretation, dependent on which studies are chosen to support one\u2019\
    s viewpoint and how the evidence is presented. Future technological change remains\
    \ the greatest unknown factor."
Methodology:
  7: "The paper uses FAO crop yield data, Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST)\
    \ data series, and calculates historical annual temperatures by crop and continent,\
    \ spatially-weighted by a continent\u2019s countries that are in the global top\
    \ twenty producing countries of the crop in question, from 1961-2018."
  11: Linear regressions using first differences in yield with temperature and precipitation
    as explanatory variables; panel analyses; meta-analysis of 1,048 observations
    from 66 studies.
  12: Regression models considering temperature, CO2, technological advances, and
    other adaptations to examine impact of climate change on observed yield trends
    at the country level for 1961-2013. Includes spatially-weighted temperatures and
    interaction effects between CO2 and temperature. Data comes from the top twenty
    producers of each crop.
  13: A panel regression model is used to observe variations in crop yields within
    periods (1961-2013) and between 57 countries.
  14: Uses spatially-weighted temperature data from Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature
    series; production-weighted temperatures for larger countries based on USDA production
    maps; Mauna Loa annual CO2 data from NOAA; Penn World Table (PWT) version 9.1
    database for socio-demographic characteristics, inputs, outputs and productivity.
  16: Fixed effects panel regression model is used to analyze the relationship between
    crop yields and climate factors, controlling for time-invariant regressors and
    exploiting variation across time periods within and between countries.
  18: Regression analysis is performed with CO2, Temperature, and their squared and
    interaction terms as independent variables. Controls for GDP per capita and human
    capital are added in some model specifications. T-statistics in parentheses are
    used for statistical significance.
  19: Regression analysis using data from multiple countries. Models include linear,
    quadratic, and interaction terms for CO2 and temperature. Some models control
    for GDP per capita and human capital.
  21: Regression analysis is used to estimate the impact of CO2 and temperature on
    crop yields. Marginal effects are calculated and evaluated at average levels of
    CO2 and temperature. Tipping points (where increases in CO2 or temperature lead
    to falling crop yields) are computed by setting first-order partial derivatives
    equal to zero. The analysis includes controls for GDP per capita and human capital
    in some model specifications.
  22: Regression models are used to derive marginal effects of CO2 and temperature
    on crop yields. Tipping points are computed based on parameter values from the
    regression models, using average levels of temperature and CO2.
  23: Statistical analysis of crop yield sensitivity to CO2 and temperature using
    surface air temperatures. Marginal effects are plotted to identify tipping points.
  24: Empirical analysis relating temperature and CO2 levels to crop yields. The applicability
    of results is unclear without further context.
More Notes:
  7: The paper focuses on the yields of six crops (maize, wheat, soybean, rapeseed/canola,
    and sorghum) and their relationship to temperature and CO2 levels.
  11: Challinor et al. concluded that adaptation in temperate regions could lead to
    an increase in yields for wheat, maize, and rice.
  13: The data includes socio-demographic characteristics of each country. The real
    GDP per capita is measured in $U.S. 2011 millions adjusted for Purchasing Power
    Parity (PPP).
  14: Assumes atmospheric CO2 is uniformly distributed across countries due to data
    limitations. Model is intended to provide useful insights regarding the inferred
    impact of climate change on crop yield trends.
  16: The model includes quadratic terms for temperature and CO2, as well as an interaction
    term, to account for non-linearities.
  18: Limited CO2 data may affect the results for maize. Adding GDP per capita and
    human capital improves the model fit and suggests the effects of CO2 and temperature
    may be overstated in the initial model.
  19: The inclusion of human capital control significantly reduces the estimated parameter
    on the linear CO2 term for soybeans, suggesting omitted variable bias in models
    without this control. The impact of the interaction between CO2 and temperature
    is generally small.
  21: The paper focuses on the impact of climate variables on crop yields, which can
    then impact macroeconomic and fiscal outcomes due to, for example, an impact on
    agricultural productivity and food security. The analysis does not directly quantify
    the macroeconomic or fiscal impacts.
  22: Parameters that are underlined indicate statistical insignificance at the 10%
    level or better. The marginal effect of CO2 (temperature) can be evaluated at
    the average level of temperature (CO2) to isolate the main effects.
  23: The authors caution that the tipping points should be taken with a grain of
    salt due to a lack of statistical significance in some cases. The temperature
    tipping point for wheat seems meaningless given the absence of negative impacts
    on yields.
  24: The text mentions a 'tipping point of 396.2 ppm' for wheat, but it's not clear
    what this refers to from the provided information. The text also contrasts the
    findings with 'the reality that crop yields have'. There's an implication that
    the findings might be incomplete or contradictory with larger trends and data
    but not enough detail.
  27: New weather-indexed insurance products are increasingly becoming available,
    which will incentivize farmers to adapt to climate change by taking risks pertaining
    to new crops and cropping methods.
