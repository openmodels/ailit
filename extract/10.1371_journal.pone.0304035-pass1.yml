Drivers of Risk:
  1: Environmental variations including average temperature, minimum temperature,
    maximum temperature, evapotranspiration, precipitation, runoff, soil moisture,
    vapor pressure, radiation, and wind speed.
  2: Climate change is impacting the environmental conditions necessary for agricultural
    production, affecting crops like coffee, sugarcane, rice, and corn.
  3: Environmental variables like temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration,
    soil moisture, and others impact crop production in Colombia.
  4: Environmental variations, specifically temperature and precipitation changes.
  5: Environmental variations (temperature, vapor pressure, minimum temperature).
  6: Variations in average, minimum, and maximum temperature, wind speed, vapor pressure,
    soil moisture, runoff, precipitation, radiation, and evapotranspiration.
  7: Environmental variations (temperature and precipitation)
  8: Increases in average temperatures.
  10: "Increase in minimum temperatures and vapor pressure negatively impacting coffee\
    \ production. Temperature increase decreasing rice production. Temperature increase\
    \ impacting sugarcane production. Drought season (\u201CEl Ni\xF1o\u201D) decreasing\
    \ rice production. Increases in average temperatures may change the natural equilibrium\
    \ of pathogens' population, inducing the emergence and the dispersion of pests\
    \ and diseases."
  11: Temperature increases, vapor pressure increases, global warming, droughts, extreme
    rainy seasons, hydrological variables, water availability.
  13: "Mentions environmental variations, El Ni\xF1o Southern Oscillation, climate\
    \ change, weather shocks."
Highlights:
  1: Increases in average temperature negatively affect coffee, rice, and sugarcane
    production, but positively affect palm oil and corn production; increased vapor
    pressure generally negatively impacts crop yields.
  2: Climate change might affect agricultural production due to increased temperatures
    impacting food security. Adaptation strategies involving higher altitudes for
    coffee and less water consumption for sugarcane, rice, and corn are needed.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Temperature is increasing in Colombia, while precipitation follows a random pattern.
    Sugarcane production was highest from 2007 to 2020. Palm oil production has experienced
    a constant rise.
  5: Vapor pressure and minimum temperature were the most impactful variables on crop
    production.
  6: Average temperature increases may help corn and palm oil production but affect
    coffee, sugarcane, and rice. Dry air conditions might decrease coffee, corn, palm
    oil, and sugarcane production but increase rice production. Wind speed increases
    might help palm oil and sugarcane production but impact corn and rice production.
  7: Environmental variations impact the production of principal agricultural products
    in Colombia; Temperature and precipitation data from 1960 to 2020 are visualized;
    Data is available on the annual production of major agricultural products in Colombia
  8: Increases in average temperatures can affect coffee, rice, and sugarcane production
    negatively, but can boost palm oil and corn production in Colombia.
  10: Coffee production is negatively affected by increased temperatures and vapor
    pressure. Rice production is decreased by temperature increases and drought. Sugarcane
    production is also negatively affected by temperature increases, but to a lesser
    extent. Coffee crops in low altitudes should be substituted to higher altitudes.
  11: Environmental changes negatively impact traditional products like coffee and
    rice. Adaptation is needed to promote products such as corn and palm oil due to
    negative impacts on traditional crops. Colombia has experienced an increase in
    average temperatures impacting the production of commodities such as coffee and
    rice.

Methodology:
  1: Bayesian spatio-temporal model used with production, climatic, and hydrological
    data of 1121 municipalities from 2007 to 2020.
