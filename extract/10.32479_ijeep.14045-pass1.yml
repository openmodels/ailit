Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change
  2: Climate change variables like precipitation rate, temperature, and carbon dioxide
    emissions
  5: Climate change causing temperature increase and coral reef degradation, leading
    to reduced tourism.
  7: No explicit shocks or changes impacting macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes are
    discussed on this page.
  8: Carbon dioxide emissions (LCO2), average annual temperatures (LTASMEAN), gross
    capital formation (LGDITOTL), and percentage of arable land (LLAND) and rainfall
    (LPRECIPITATION) drive the outcome of interest.
  9: Climate change indicators (LRCPT, LCO2, LTASMEAN, LLAND)
  10: Carbon dioxide emissions have a significant negative long-term impact on international
    tourism revenues.
Highlights:
  2: The short and long-term impacts of climate change (precipitation and temperature)
    on tourism revenue are positive but not significant, while CO2 emissions have
    a significant long-term negative impact
  5: "High vulnerability of Egypt\u2019s tourism to climate change, with significant\
    \ anticipated decrease in tourist arrivals and revenue losses."
  7: The ARDL model shows a relatively high adjusted R-squared (0.71), indicating
    the model explains approximately 71% of changes in an unspecified dependent variable;
    the overall model is statistically significant.
  8: There is a long-run inverse relationship between international tourism and carbon
    dioxide emissions, and a long-run positive relationship between international
    tourism and gross capital formation, and percentage of arable land. Short-term
    coefficients of average annual temperatures, gross capital formation, and the
    percentage of arable land are significant. The economic system corrects short-term
    imbalances at a rate of 183.52% to achieve long-run equilibrium and it takes approximately
    0.544 years for the economic system to return to equilibrium.
  9: There is a cointegration relationship between climate change indicators and international
    tourism in Egypt, implying that environmental changes have an impact on international
    tourism revenues.
  10: Climate change will be a challenge for Egypt's economy in the coming decades,
    particularly affecting the tourism sector.
Methodology:
  1: Empirical analysis related to tourism demand in Egypt.
  2: Used an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to investigate both short
    and long-run estimates
  5: Analysis models international tourism revenues as a function of climate variables
    including temperature, precipitation, and CO2 emissions.
  6: The study uses an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to investigate
    the short- and long-term relationships between climate change (CO2 emissions,
    Precipitation, Temperatures) and international tourism revenues as a percentage
    of total exports. Unit root tests (Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillip Perron
    (PP)) were adopted to investigate the stationary importance for long-term connections
    of time series data. The optimal lag length selection is based on the Akaike information
    criterion (AIC) and SC.
  7: The analysis is performed using an ARDL (Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag) model
    to examine relationships between variables with sample data from 1990 to 2020.
  8: Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model used to estimate short-run and long-run
    coefficients; ARCH test, Breusch-Godfrey serial correlation LM test, Jarque-Bera
    normality test, CUSUM and CUSUM of Squares tests are used for diagnostic testing.

    model
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the impact of climate change on tourism, which can indirectly
    affect macroeconomic outcomes like GDP and fiscal revenues (tourism taxes), but
    does not provide specific estimates of these effects.
  6: The study focuses on the relationship between climate change variables (CO2 emissions,
    precipitation, and temperatures) and international tourism revenues. The paper
    presents unit root tests and lag length selection results. The use of ARDL models
    is described as enabling the separation of long-term and short-term effects and
    allowing the study to determine the complementary relationship between variables.
  7: The page discusses the stationarity of residuals and uses ARDL bounds test of
    cointegration to examine long-run relationships between variables, highlighting
    the model's non-spurious relationship.
  8: The model demonstrates structural stability based on CUSUM and CUSUM of Squares
    tests and has predictive capacity.
  9: Gross capital formation is identified as an important macroeconomic indicator
    with a strong influence on GDP.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Impact of climate change on international tourism in Egypt.
  2: Carbon dioxide emissions have a long-term negative impact on international tourism
    revenues
  5: 20% decrease in annual tourist arrivals for Egypt in 2060 foreseen, reducing
    tourism revenues by 13-17 billion pounds annually.
  7: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes or measures related to economic
    costs and/or benefits of nation-wide adaptation are explicitly mentioned on this
    page.
  8: International tourism is the main outcome of interest.
  9: International tourism revenues
Quantitative material:
  5: Tourism losses estimated at 19 billion pounds in 2030 and 85 billion pounds in
    2060 for Egypt.
  6: Table 2 reports the results of the Phillips-Perron test, showing the tau values
    and tabulated values at 1%, 5%, and 10% significance levels for different variables
    (International tourism, CO2 emissions, Precipitation, Temperatures, Gross capital
    formation, Arable land) at level and first difference. Table 3 shows the results
    of lag selection based on LogL, LR, FPE, AIC, SC, and HQ. The optimal number of
    lags (1) is calculated using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and SC.
  7: The page provides model estimation coefficients but does not directly quantify
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes of interest.
  8: Calculated F-statistics are 8.052331, Error Correction Term (ECT) is -5.966734
    (significant at 1%), adjusted R-squared is 0.84; ARDL long-run coefficients for
    LCO2 is -0.314565, LPRECIPITATION is 0.235993, LTASMEAN is 3.644415, LGDITOTL

    0.034.

    for various variables in an error correction model. For example, the coefficient
    for D(LRCPT(-1)) is 0.261668 with a standard error of 0.118324. The coefficient
    for CointEq(-1)* is -1.835255.
