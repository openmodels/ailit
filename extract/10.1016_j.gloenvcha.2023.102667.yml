Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate and socioeconomic changes impacting future fire carbon emissions.
  2: Meteorology (fuel dryness), biomass, land use, population density, and gross
    domestic product (GDP) per capita are drivers of fire carbon emissions.
  3: Compound effects of drivers (climate, biomass, land use, and socioeconomic changes)
    on fire C emissions will vary by region.
  6: Future fire C emissions are influenced by RCP scenarios (GHG emission pathways)
    and SSP scenarios (socioeconomic development including population, income, and
    land use). Specific factors considered are meteorology (air temperature, relative
    humidity, precipitation, wind speed, soil properties), biomass, land use, population,
    and GDP.
  9: Shocks or changes include population density and GDP per capita influencing fire
    carbon emissions and management.
  11: Fire-induced carbon emissions; fuel dryness in forests; climate-driven increases
    in fire, potentially accelerating thawing in permafrost soil.
Highlights:
  1: Sustainable economic development might decrease future emissions of fire carbon.
  2: Increased GDP per capita can lead to improvement in fire management and capitalized
    agriculture, resulting in decreased global future fire carbon emissions.
  3: The results will help us to understand potential future fire C emissions and
    determine appropriate responses. Also, we should be able to better identify which
    factors will be the key drivers for increasing or decreasing future fire C emissions.
  6: No relevant information
  9: GDP per capita in particular regions like the African savanna and Southeast Asia
    significantly influences reductions in fire carbon emissions due to economic development.
  11: Steep GDP per capita increases in formerly low-income countries could reduce
    fire occurrence.
Methodology:
  1: The paper analyzes the impact of climate and socioeconomic changes on future
    fire carbon emissions. The results are applicable to understanding the impact
    of climate and socioeconomic changes on fire carbon emissions.
  2: The study explores fire carbon emissions by changing five factors (meteorology,
    biomass, land use, population density, and gross domestic product [GDP] per capita)
    throughout the 21st century and comparing to a historical baseline (2006-2015).
  3: We used the Community Land Model (CLM)-based fire model and predicted changes
    in future fire C emissions in the 21st century by changing these five drivers
    under nine SSP-RCP scenarios.
  6: A decomposition analysis is used to identify the key factors characterizing the
    SSPs and RCPs on future cumulative fire C emissions (CCE) for the period 2020-2099.
    The method of Marangoni et al. (2017) and Stehfest et al. (2019) is used to identify
    both the individual and total effects of each factor. A reference scenario with
    historical conditions is used as a baseline.
  9: The analysis uses decomposition to ascertain individual and total effects of
    various factors on carbon storage changes over 80 years.
  11: Simulation of the fire scheme using ISIMIP CLM4.5 biomass outcomes; sensitivity
    test showed uncertainty in projections of the impact of future economic development
    on fires.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on fire carbon emissions as an outcome, which is related to
    climate change, but does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes
    at a national level. It suggests that sustainable economic development can mitigate
    these emissions.
  2: The study suggests that incorporating future spatial changes under diverse scenarios
    will be helpful to develop national mitigation and adaptation plans.
  3: The study explores the compound effects of meteorology, biomass, land use, population
    density, and gross domestic product [GDP] per capita on future fire C emissions.
  6: The ISIMIP2b simulations are used to obtain meteorology and biomass variables.
    The study uses three RCP scenarios (RCP2.6/6.0/8.5) and three socioeconomic development
    scenarios (SSP1/2/3). Land use data for SSP3-2.6 and SSP1-6.0 were unavailable,
    so SSP3-3.4 and SSP1-8.5 were used as compromises.
  11: The impact of GDP per capita on fire spread and fire count varies between models,
    showing uncertainty in projections.

    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, costs, or benefits of adaptation at a
    national level. The focus is on climate-related impacts (fire) rather than economic
    consequences.
