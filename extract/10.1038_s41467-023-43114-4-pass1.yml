Drivers of Risk:
  1: Tropical cyclones, particularly in the context of global warming and increased
    frequency of intense storms, are drivers of risk impacting economic growth.
  3: Future greenhouse gas emissions, Socioeconomic development, Normative assumptions
    on discounting, Historical growth response of countries to TCs, Response of TC
    impacts to future greenhouse gas emissions, Response of temperature to a greenhouse
    gas emission pulse.
  4: Tropical cyclones and their impacts on economic growth are identified as the
    primary drivers of risk.
  5: Tropical cyclones and uncertainty dimensions like socioeconomic pathways and
    growth-adjusted discount rates.
  6: The analysis focuses on the impact of global mean temperature changes on tropical
    cyclone-induced economic growth losses.
  7: Tropical cyclones (TCs).
  9: The page identifies the global mean temperature (GMT) as a driver influencing
    the frequency and intensity of landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs).
  10: The analysis considers potential impacts due to varying Representative Concentration
    Pathways (RCPs), Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), GCMs, tropical cyclone
    (TC) time series, all contributing to changes in GDPpc growth rates.
  13: TC exposure, Historical population-weighted temperature time series
Evaluation overview:
  1: The paper evaluates the social costs and long-term economic impacts of tropical
    cyclones (TCs), specifically their effect on economic development and the social
    cost of carbon (SCC).
  3: Tropical cyclone (TC) damages, Discounted Annual Damage (DAD) by TCs, and TC-induced
    Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)
  4: The paper evaluates the economic impacts of tropical cyclones (TCs) on GDP trajectories
    globally and at the country level.
  5: Global and country-level discounted annual damage (DAD) from tropical cyclone
    impacts, measured in Trillion US$ and relative to global world product (GWP) and
    average household income.
  6: The analysis provides an overview of tropical cyclone-induced economic growth
    losses with respect to global mean temperature changes.
  7: Social cost of carbon (SCC) globally and at the country level.
  9: The page discusses TC (tropical cyclone) damage functions and the social cost
    of carbon related to TCs and population exposure to strong TC winds.
  10: The page discusses the projection of temperature-dependent damages to national
    GDP per capita (GDPpc) growth rates over the period from 2010 to 2100 due to tropical
    cyclones (TCs).
  13: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: Including TC impacts in climate policy evaluation can significantly increase
    the perceived benefits of climate policies, which are potentially underestimated
    under current SCC models.
  3: TC strikes reduce growth in the short-, mid-, and long-term. Heterogeneous exposure
    of countries to TCs leads to substantially different induced growth losses. TC
    impacts are an additional impact channel not captured by population-weighted temperature
    over land alone.
  4: The analysis shows that growth losses due to TCs do not depend on development
    level, but rather on specific country characteristics, affecting all income groups
    negatively.
  5: Quantifies the uncertainty in DAD from tropical cyclones, identifying the most
    impacted countries and showing the distribution of DAD relative to household income.
  6: A significant increase in the median Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) when accounting
    for tropical cyclones, with the SCC being highest under the RCP8.5 scenario.
  7: Tropical cyclones increase the social cost of carbon. Low- and middle-income
    TC-prone countries could face even larger adaptation challenges, in relative terms.
    Differences in income among countries must not be neglected when estimating and
    comparing the adaptation challenges of countries. DADs are highest for strongly
    exposed high-income countries such as Taiwan, Japan, and the USA in per-capita
    terms. Relative to average household income, damages are comparable to the USA
    for upper-middle-income island states of Mauritius and Jamaica, and for lower-middle-income
    countries of the Philippines and Vietnam.
  9: The page highlights the regression approach used to estimate the impact of temperature
    and TC exposure on GDP per capita growth.
  10: Finds structural dependence on RCPs for GDPpc impacts, with significant proportion
    of samples requiring rejection of null hypotheses across uncertainty dimensions;
    however, dependence on SSPs is not significant.
  11: The study defines a method for calculating the TC-induced SCC by determining
    the difference between the SCC with and without the contribution of TCs.
  13: No relevant information
Methodology:
  1: The analysis derives temperature-dependent damage functions for 41 TC-affected
    countries to quantify the SCC induced by TCs, with a focus on persistent growth
    effects.
  3: "Scenario analysis and probabilistic methods (bootstrapping).  TC impact emulator\
    \ employed to generate probabilistic time series of TCs based on output from four\
    \ different global climate models. Assesses three standard choices for discount\
    \ rates.  The study uses a model with eight lag years as main specification. The\
    \ DAD is estimated over the period 2010\u20132100."
  4: The paper uses synthetic TC tracks and population projections from SSPs to estimate
    national shares of affected people, translating these into GDP deviations. They
    employ empirical growth models and temperature-dependent damage functions to estimate
    impacts.
  5: Uses Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
    (SSPs), different growth adjusted discount rates, and statistical relationships
    between GDP growth, temperature, and TC impacts in a regression framework.
  6: The study uses a process-based modeling approach and mixed-effects model fitting
    to assess tropical cyclone impacts on economic growth losses.
  7: Uses DICE model with different discount rates. Considers uncertainty dimensions.
    DAD (Damage as a proportion of income) analysis is used to compare adaptation
    challenges across countries.
  9: The analysis employs a three-way fixed effects panel model and uses the CLIMADA
    tool to generate wind footprints for TCs, assessing population exposure and economic
    impacts.
  10: The paper uses RCP-SSP-GCM scenario combinations with mixed-effects linear regression
    models to estimate temperature-dependent damage functions and structural dependence
    tests for different scenarios. Results apply to GDPpc projections until 2100 and
    for SCC calculation until 2200.

    historical and projected GDP, population, temperature, and tropical cyclone exposure
    data sets.

    and historical temperature time series data.
More Notes:
  3: The paper identifies six relevant uncertainty dimensions (UD) which are mapped
    out carefully by a combination of scenario analysis and probabilistic methods.
  4: Discounting is the primary source of uncertainty in the economic impact estimates,
    with the effect of discounting affecting the variation across years.
  5: Combines Burke's temperature terms with terms measuring TC impacts to avoid double
    counting. Estimates the absolute TC-induced SCC and the relative increase in SCC
    due to TCs.
  9: The section discusses bootstrapping 1200 samples to account for uncertainties
    in economic growth regression and validates model robustness by comparing with
    previous studies' results.

Quantitative material:
  1: The analysis finds that accounting for TC impacts increases the median global
    SCC from US$ 173 to US$ 212 per tonne of CO2.
  3: Average annual growth losses for strongly exposed countries such as Japan (1.63%)
    or the Philippines (2.62%) were in the historical period on average 10 and 15
    times higher than for the only partially exposed USA (0.17%).

    scenarios, ranging from 0.18% to 1.13% of global GDP.

    \ and 8.5 and SSPs 2 and 5. 66% confidence intervals (17-83%) are provided. The\
    \ paper estimates a preferred SCC of US$/tCO2 212 (66% CI: US$/tCO2 138\u2013\
    318)."

    \ data, indicating a historical GMT range from 0.8 to 1.3 \xB0C above pre-industrial\
    \ levels, and models with a range of 0.5 to 1.5 \xB0C."
  10: Specific percentage values are not provided, but the analysis involves discounting
    differences in GDPpc growth rates across scenarios and calculating the social
    cost of carbon (SCC) from TCs.
