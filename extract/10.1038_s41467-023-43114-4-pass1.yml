Drivers of Risk:
  1: Tropical cyclones (TCs), temperature increases related to climate change, socioeconomic
    vulnerability
  2: Tropical cyclones (TCs), temperature, emission scenarios (RCPs), socioeconomic
    development (SSPs), and economic discounting scenario combinations.
  3: Future greenhouse gas emissions, Socioeconomic development (population and economic
    growth), Normative assumptions on discounting, Historical growth response of countries
    to TCs, Response of TC impacts to future greenhouse gas emissions, Response of
    temperature to a greenhouse gas emission pulse, Sea-surface temperature increase,
    atmospheric circulation conditions (shear winds, location of genesis)
  4: Tropical cyclones (TCs), global mean temperature (GMT)
  5: Tropical cyclones, different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, 6.0,
    8.5), Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2 and SSP5), growth adjusted discount
    rates
  6: Global mean temperature change (relative to pre-industrial levels) and tropical
    cyclone (TC) induced growth losses are the main drivers of risk.
  7: Tropical cyclones (TCs).
  8: Changes impacting outcomes include tropical cyclones (TCs) contributing to economic
    losses.
  9: Tropical cyclone (TC) frequency and intensity, global mean temperature.
  11: Tropical cyclones (TCs), temperature increases
  13: Climate change impacts on agriculture; Tropical cyclone climatology change exacerbating
    US extreme rainfall-surge hazard.
Highlights:
  1: Accounting for TC impacts substantially increases the global SCC, suggesting
    the benefits of climate policies could be underestimated.
  2: Estimates discounted annual damage (DAD) and contribution of TCs to the social
    cost of carbon (SCC) for different scenarios. Including TC effects does not affect
    the obtained results.
  3: "TC strikes reduce growth in the short-, mid-, and long-term. Cumulative (median)\
    \ growth losses first monotonically increase with the number of lag years considered\
    \ before they somewhat remain constant for 6\u201313 lags. Heterogeneous exposure\
    \ of countries to TCs leads to substantially different induced growth losses."
  4: Growth losses increase with GMT for 37 out of the 41 TC-affected countries considered.
    Growth losses do not depend on the development level but rather on country-specific
    characteristics.
  5: Tropical cyclones cause significant discounted annual damage, both globally and
    at the country level; uncertainty in climate models (RCPs and SSPs) and discounting
    choices significantly impact damage estimates; impact of tropical cyclone damage
    on the social cost of carbon
  6: The paper finds that tropical cyclones lead to notable increases in the Social
    Cost of Carbon (SCC), especially for large emitters like the USA. The discount
    rate has the largest impact on SCC estimates. The TC-SCC is determined by exposure
    and economic vulnerability. The USA perceives the largest increase in median SCC
    through TCs.
  7: Tropical cyclones increase the social cost of carbon. Lower- and middle-income
    countries face larger adaptation challenges in relative terms (damage as percentage
    of income) than high-income countries. Damage as percentage of income is highest
    for Taiwan, Japan and the USA, but when damage is measured relative to average
    household income the damages for upper-middle income island states of Mauritius
    and Jamaica and lower-middle income countries of the Philippines and Vietnam become
    comparable to those of the USA.
  8: TC damages are significant, increasing SCC for major emitting countries like
    China, USA, and India. The study suggests that accounting for TCs can substantially
    increase SCC estimates.
  9: The global non-linear effect of temperature is expressed as a quadratic function.
  11: The paper defines and calculates the Tropical Cyclone-induced SCC (TC-SCC),
    which is the difference between the SCC with and without the contribution of TCs.
Methodology:
  1: Derive temperature-dependent damage functions for 41 TC-affected countries to
    quantify the country-level SCC induced by the persistent growth effects of damaging
    TCs.
  2: The paper uses a modeling framework comprising historical growth responses to
    TC strikes, probabilistic event-based projections of TC damages using a TC emulator,
    and country-specific temperature-dependent damage functions. Employs a three-way
    fixed effects panel model with annual national shares of people exposed to TCs
    as exogenous predictors. Models damages as functions of GMT change.
  3: 'Scenario analysis and probabilistic methods (bootstrapping).  Six uncertainty
    dimensions are considered: future greenhouse gas emissions, socioeconomic development,
    normative assumptions on discounting, historical growth response of countries
    to TCs, response of TC impacts to future greenhouse gas emissions, and response
    of temperature to a greenhouse gas emission pulse.  Employs a maximum entropy
    bootstrapping method to express uncertainties associated with the historical growth
    estimates. Generates 1200 bootstraps for each country and estimates the growth
    response individually for each bootstrap.  Uses a statistical TC emulator to generate
    probabilistic time series of TCs based on the output from four different global
    climate models. DAD is estimated over the period 2010-2100.'
  4: Empirical growth model to translate shares of affected people into deviations
    of national GDP pathways.  Derives event-based, country-level temperature-dependent
    damage functions for TCs.  Mixed-effects modeling approach is used to account
    for the dependencies on RCP scenarios as random effects in regression analysis.
    SCC estimation uses the difference in future GDP per capita projections under
    climate damage with and without an additional emission pulse.
  5: Uses different values of the growth adjusted discount rates; quantifies uncertainties
    using 120,000 realizations; combines temperature terms with terms measuring the
    TC impacts in a common regression framework; calculates TC-induced SCC (TC-SCC)
    by subtracting the SCC calculated without TC impacts from the SCC calculated with
    TC impacts
  6: The paper combines process-based modeling of population exposure to TCs with
    an empirical growth model. The mixed-effects model is used to estimate the impact
    of TCs on growth, considering RCP-specific random effects. The analysis accounts
    for uncertainty dimensions and uses different discount rates (including the Stern
    discount rate). The paper also mentions the use of damage functions.
  7: Uses a damage assessment and distribution (DAD) analysis.  The study considers
    uncertainty dimensions. It resolves the impacts from annual temperatures and TCs
    explicitly. The models use 8 lags.
  8: The analysis derives SCC estimates through methodology involving temperature
    damage functions and persistence of damages, with scenarios including historical
    growth responses to TCs.
  9: Uses a three-way fixed effects panel model to estimate the national GDPpc growth
    responses over the period 1981-2015, incorporating temperature and TC impacts.
    Employs a bootstrapping strategy to account for uncertainties.
  11: The paper uses a discrete-time definition of discount rates. It calculates the
    SCC with and without the contribution of TCs. The TC-induced SCC (TC-SCC) is defined
    as the difference between the SCC with and without the contribution of TCs. The
    analysis was implemented in Python 3.9 with CLI-MADA 3.3.3 and statsmodels 0.13.5.
  13: 'The method was designed by H.K., C.O., and T.V. T.G. and T.V. provided the
    TC exposure. C.S. generated the historical population-weighted temperature time
    series. F.P. calculated the SCC. H.K. and T.V. conducted the rest of the simulations. '
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the persistent growth effects of TCs, differentiating it
    from studies focusing on direct damages.
  3: The analysis accounts for compounding uncertainties and dependencies regarding
    future population and economic development.  Discount rates are adjusted by the
    economic growth rate of the considered country. The modeling chain averages results
    only at the very end and separately for each of the RCP-SSP-discounting scenario
    combinations.
  4: Discounting represents the primary source of uncertainty in the DAD calculation.
    The relationship between GMT and TC-induced growth rate changes is independent
    of the SSP scenarios at the 10% level of significance, but depends on the RCPs.
    Historically implemented adaptation measures may not suffice to compensate for
    climate change-induced loss increases in the future, even in high-income countries.
  5: The analysis considers uncertainty dimensions related to climate models and socioeconomic
    pathways. Results are presented for different scenarios (RCPs and SSPs) and discount
    rates. The analysis focuses on the period 2010-2100.
  6: "The damage functions used are temperature-dependent and quasi-universal. The\
    \ framework used could be extended to other categories of extreme weather events.\
    \ The persistence of growth losses and accounting for the country\u2019s GHG emissions\
    \ is considered. There are high tail risks associated with country-level TC-SCC."
  7: The DAD analysis likely underestimates the economic implications for lower-income
    populations, as they are often more exposed to, and need longer to recover from,
    TC strikes. The paper acknowledges that its SCC estimate may implicitly account
    for other impact channels such as health impacts.
  9: Applies a correction factor to simulated TC-affected people to align with historical
    data. The study analyzes 174 countries, identifying 41 as being affected by TCs
    in the historical period (1981-2015). Uses eight lag years as the main specification.
    The TC impact terms do not affect the temperature coefficients at the 10% level
    of significance and vice versa.

    WindRiskTech and not publicly available. All other code is openly available.
