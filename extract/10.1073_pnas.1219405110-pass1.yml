Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Mega-El Ni\xF1o/Southern Oscillation, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, hemispherical\
    \ asymmetric global warming"
  2: Anthropogenic forcing (increasing greenhouse gases) can influence the Northern
    Hemisphere summer monsoon (NHSM) system, but the recent intensification may arise
    primarily from internal feedback processes within the climate system.
  3: Variability and trends of the Northern Hemisphere Summer Monsoon (NHSM) system,
    Hadley circulation, Walker circulation, and Pacific SST anomalies (Mega-ENSO index)
    are identified as drivers.
  4: NHSM circulation index is correlated with mega-ENSO, AMO, and hemispheric thermal
    contrast (HTC).
  5: The North Hemisphere Summer Monsoon (NHSM) system is significantly linked to
    the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) which can influence precipitation
    and circulation. Mega-ENSO and AMO can explain 73% of the total variance of the
    NHSM circulation index. The enhanced hemispheric thermal contrast can generate
    meridional pressure gradients that drive low-level cross-equatorial flows from
    the Southern Hemisphere to the Northern Hemisphere and converge into the NHSM
    trough regions. Volcanic eruptions (El Chichon and Mount Pinatubo) impact the
    NHSM precipitation and circulation index.
Highlights:
  1: "During recent global warming of about 0.4 \xB0C since the late 1970s, a coherent\
    \ decadal change of precipitation and circulation emerges in the entirety of the\
    \ NHSM system, including substantial intensification of the NHSM as well as the\
    \ Hadley and Walker circulations."
  2: The Northern Hemisphere summer monsoon (NHSM) system has significantly intensified
    over the recent three decades. The Hadley cell and Walker circulation in boreal
    summer exhibit statistically significant upward trends.
  3: The Mega-ENSO index has an increasing trend over the past 30 years, unlike the
    ENSO index. The Mega-ENSO is well correlated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation
    (PDO).
  4: The mega-ENSO reflects a broader range of variability than ENSO, PDO, or IPO
    alone, and it is an integrated measure of the interannual-to-interdecadal variations
    of the Pacific (or global) SST.
  5: The recent intensification of the NHSM may be largely due to internal natural
    variability. The mega-ENSO and AMO are primary sources of interdecadal variations
    of the NHSM. The combined effect of mega-ENSO and AMO can explain 73% of the total
    variance of the NHSM circulation.
Methodology:
  1: Integrated study of the changes of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer monsoon
    (NHSM) system, defined as coherent changes of monsoon precipitation and circulation.
  2: "The study analyzes the relationship between NHSM precipitation and circulation\
    \ indices, using data from 1979\u20132011. It also compares observed trends with\
    \ multimodel projections from CMIP5."
  3: "Uses ERAI and GPCP, version 2.2, data for the period of 1979\u20132011. Employs\
    \ trend\u2013noise ratio (TN) and Mann\u2013Kendall rank statistics (MK) for statistical\
    \ significance. Modifies the original definition of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation\
    \ (IPO) by using the PC2 of the 3-y running mean global SST."
  4: "Regression analysis of climate anomalies with respect to the NHSM circulation\
    \ (VWS) index for the period of 1979\u20132010 using HadISST and ERAI reanalysis\
    \ data. Correlation analysis using merged ERA-40 (1958\u20131978) and ERAI (1979\u2013\
    2011) reanalysis datasets."
  5: The study uses global precipitation datasets (GPCP and CMAP) and ensemble means
    to detect interannual variations. A 3-year running mean is used as a low-pass
    filter to describe decadal variations. Linear trends are tested using the trend-noise
    ratio and Mann-Kendall rank statistics. Climate models (CMIP5) and a coupled model
    (POEM) are used to assess future changes and impacts.
More Notes:
  1: "The interannual variation of NHSM rainfall is highly correlated with the El\
    \ Ni\xF1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index. The NHSM circulation index is defined\
    \ by the vertical shear of zonal winds between 850 and 200 hPa averaged in a zone\
    \ stretching from Mexico eastward to the Philippines (0\xB0\u201320\xB0N, 120\xB0\
    W\u2013120\xB0E)."
  2: The recent intensification of the NHSM system is not well captured by multimodel
    projections under increasing anthropogenic forcing, suggesting internal climate
    system feedbacks may be dominant.

Quantitative material:
  1: NHSM rainfall increases by 9.5% per degree of global warming.
  2: "The NHSM rainfall exhibits a statistically significant positive trend of \u223C\
    \ 0.08 mm\xB7d\u22121 per decade (Table 1) or 9.5% increase per degree of global\
    \ surface air temperature increase."
  3: "Presents trends (1979-2011) for NHSM precipitation intensity (0.08 mm\xB7d\u2212\
    1 per decade), NHSM circulation index (0.85 m\xB7s\u22121 per decade), Hadley\
    \ circulation intensity (0.73\xD71010 kg\xB7s\u22121 per decade), Walker circulation\
    \ intensity (-0.44 m\xB7s\u22121 per decade), and Mega-ENSO index (0.20 \xB0C\
    \ per decade) along with their statistical significances."
  4: "Normalized NHSM circulation index and the normalized mega-ENSO index (r = 0.77).\
    \ Normalized AMO index, which is significantly correlated with the NHSM circulation\
    \ index (r = 0.44). Normalized HTC index measured by the 2-m air temperature averaged\
    \ over the NH (0\u201360\xB0N) minus that over the SH (0\u201360\xB0S), which\
    \ is significantly correlated with the NHSM circulation index (r = 0.63)."
  5: The paper finds a correlation (r = 0.44 for 1958-2011) between the NHSM system
    and the AMO. The combined effect of mega-ENSO and AMO can explain 73% of the total
    variance of the NHSM circulation index (r = 0.85 for 1958-2011). The correlation
    between NHSM intensity and hemispheric thermal contrast is r=0.63.
