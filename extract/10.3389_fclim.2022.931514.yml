Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased climate variability and more frequent weather extremes such as floods
    and droughts in Ethiopia.
  5: Geographically sparse and poorly maintained surface and upper air stations, underinvestment
    in satellite data reception and processing systems leading to a shortfall of meteorological
    information.
Highlights:
  1: Climate services can contribute to alleviating a range of climate-sensitive development
    challenges, including agricultural production and food security.
Methodology:
  5: Blending rainfall and temperature observations collected by national weather
    services with freely available global products derived from satellite data and
    climate model reanalysis products (ENACTS initiative).
More Notes:
  1: The International Research Institute for Climate and Society's ACToday project
    aims to improve food security, nutrition, environmental sustainability and economic
    outcomes by promoting the use of climate information and services.
  5: The National Framework for Climate Services (NFCS) drives coordination of institutions
    and actions across the four pillars of climate services (Generate, Use, Translate,
    and Transfer).
No relevant information:
  6: This page focuses on climate data tools and co-production of climate services
    in Ethiopia, not macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, costs, or benefits of
    adaptation.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  5: Agricultural and food security planning, monitoring, and early warning.
