Drivers of Risk:
  1: Externalities (positive or negative) associated with adaptation and mitigation
    technologies.
  3: Adoption dynamics of maladaptation and mitigation technologies; negative externalities
    of maladaptation and positive externalities of mitigation; green policies in developed
    regions that have negative impacts on the environment in less developed regions
    (environmental dumping).
  4: Negative externalities from more developed to less developed regions can decrease
    overall well-being.
  14: Environmental dumping, adoption of environmental maladaptation technologies,
    policies that shift environmental burden from one country to another, exogenous
    factors (e.g., new policies) decreasing domestic environmental effect but increasing
    foreign environmental effect.
  15: Environmental policies in a more developed region may have different effects
    due to feedback interactions with a less developed region, potentially pushing
    the system toward a Pareto-dominated state.
Highlights:
  1: Externalities can lead to adoption gaps of both maladaptation and mitigation
    technologies, leading the system away from Pareto-dominant states. Over-adoption
    may occur for maladaptive technologies, whereas under-adoption may occur in case
    of mitigation. Green policies may have counterproductive effects and environmental
    dumping may occur.
  3: Identifies the underlying mechanisms that lead to over-adoption of maladaptation
    strategies and under-adoption of mitigation ones; analyzes the effects of green
    policies in developed regions that negatively impact less developed regions, showing
    that such policies may reduce the well-being of agents in both regions.
  4: 'The model concludes differing adoption patterns depending on technology type:
    maladaptive technologies lead to total adoption or none, whereas mitigation technologies
    result in partial adoption without path dependency.'
  14: Shifting environmental burden from one country to another might worsen the well-being
    of all agents. A green tax or policy in a developed region might decrease the
    domestic effect on the local resource but increase the foreign effect on the resource
    of the other region. The overall well-being effects of such policies on agents
    in the developed region cannot be assessed a priori and depends on the relative
    magnitude of the domestic effect reduction and the increase in the foreign effect.
  15: A green policy in one region can negatively affect another if feedback effects
    are not considered, even if the technology itself has positive public effects.
Methodology:
  1: The authors employ a model with two regions at different stages of development.
  3: Models the adoption dynamics of technologies in two regions at different stages
    of development using a two-region model. The model assumes individuals can adopt
    a technology that provides benefits but also generates externalities. Studies
    the effects of maladaptation technologies disproportionately burdening less developed
    regions.
  4: The analysis utilizes a population evolutionary game using replicator equations
    to study technology adoption dynamics.
  6: The analysis uses a dynamic system (replicator dynamics) to model the adoption
    of strategies (A or NA) by agents in two regions (S and N). This models how the
    population's strategy evolves over time based on imitation of more remunerative
    strategies.
  14: A model is used to study the adoption dynamics of an environmental maladaptation
    technology with negative public effects. Comparative dynamics analysis is performed
    to analyze the impact of changes in domestic and foreign environmental effects
    on well-being. The model considers two regions and the effects of shifting environmental
    burden.
  15: Analysis involves examining adoption dynamics and the effect of technology with
    positive public environmental effects on the system's stationary states and payoffs.
More Notes:
  4: The paper discusses the interplay of private and public effects on regional adaptation
    strategies, with adaptation/mitigation technology adoption influencing regional
    well-being.
  6: The replicator dynamics are based on an imitation mechanism where a small fraction
    of the population adopts a more remunerative strategy in each period. The agents'
    well-being depends on the technological choice by all agents in both regions,
    which is modeled as a population game.
  14: The model focuses on the environmental dumping of CO2 emissions and how it affects
    the well-being of agents in different regions. The analysis explores the adoption
    of maladaptation technologies that asymmetrically degrade the environmental quality
    of one region.
  15: The paper discusses adoption dynamics and the systemic movement induced by green
    technologies with positive public effects, highlighting the importance of initial
    conditions and interregional interactions.

    system, but it does not discuss any specific macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes,
    drivers of risk, or quantitative results directly related to climate change adaptation
    at a national level. The page presents proofs of propositions related to the existence
    and stability of stationary states in a model, but doesn't explicitly connect
    these states to concrete economic variables or policy implications.
  26: This page primarily presents mathematical equations related to stability analysis
    of a system, without explicitly linking to specific macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes, quantitative estimates of adaptation costs/benefits, or concrete drivers
    of climate risk in a national context. The references listed at the end do cite
    papers that include relevant content.
