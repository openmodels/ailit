Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change leading to reduced water demand, high water prices, economic depression
    causing water use changes.
  4: Overexploitation of water resources leading to ecological degradation; increasing
    water demand due to economic growth; high energy consumption of water diversion.
Highlights:
  1: The South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China is presented as a synthesis
    of supply-side and demand-side water management solutions, not just a water supply
    infrastructure. Releasing water for ecological and cultural purposes is suggested
    to maintain socio-ecological benefits in the context of declining human water
    use.
  4: The South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) has both positive and negative
    economic and ecological consequences that need to be considered in water governance.
Methodology:
  1: A co-governance framework is established to sustain water supply systems by integrating
    the political, financial, and consumptive needs of the government, the market,
    and the users, coupling both supply-side and demand-side solutions.
More Notes:
  1: The study proposes that the economic cost of water supply can be recovered through
    water fees and cooperative investment in water-related businesses involving the
    state-owned water transfer company and local governments.
  4: The paper discusses the economic impacts of a specific water diversion project,
    but it is more focused on water governance and sustainability than providing specific
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risk assessments related to climate change adaptation
    at a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Sustainability of water supply systems is challenged by idle water supply facilities
    and revenue losses due to water use changes potentially caused by climate change,
    high water prices, and economic depression.
  4: The South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) has promoted economic growth
    and social development in northern China through increasing the water supply;
    water demand in northern China will increase due to the economic growth resulting
    from the augmented water supply; ecological benefits of the SNWDP should be included
    in recovering its expenses; energy consumption of pumping water to the north via
    the eastern route is huge and will reduce the economic efficiency of the project.
