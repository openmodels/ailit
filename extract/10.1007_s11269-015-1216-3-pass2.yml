  5: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (specifically, changes in water runoff) and market liberalization
    (specifically, fluctuations in electricity prices) are drivers of risk.
  2: Climate change (affecting hydropower potential and water runoff), power market
    fluctuations (electricity prices), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
  3: Runoff, wholesale electricity prices, and supply schedules.
  5: Climate change affecting temperature, precipitation, snow cover, glacier coverage,
    and ice mass, leading to changes in runoff regime.
  9: Climate change impacts on glacier melt and runoff affecting hydropower production;
    GHG emission scenarios affecting temperature and precipitation patterns.
  10: GHG emission scenarios, downscaling method (EDDM vs DCM), GCM-RCM variability,
    initial ice volume
  11: Climate change affects hydropower runoff through glacier melting and glacier
    exhaustion, which impacts long-term hydropower revenue.
  12: Climate change, represented by different RCM-GCMs (Regional Climate Model -
    Global Climate Model) and GHG emission scenarios (A1B, A2, RCP3PD); Downscaling
    methods (MRy, MRs, MRJD, EDDM, DCM (mentioned in the text)); Initial ice volume.
  14: GHG emission scenarios, downscaling method, socio-economic variables impacting
    GHG emissions
  15: Runoff uncertainty, price uncertainty (especially energy price), changes in
    energy policy (e.g., phase-out of nuclear power, subsidies to renewables), regulatory
    framework (e.g., water rights limiting plant operator's flexibility)
Highlights:
  1: Greenhouse gas scenarios may represent a lower source of uncertainty compared
    to electricity prices; uncertainty is often case-study related; runoff uncertainty
    shifts from variability to epistemic uncertainty while electricity price uncertainty
    shifts in the opposite direction.
  2: Electricity prices present the greatest area of uncertainty, potentially jeopardizing
    future investments, energy transition, and security; current epistemic uncertainty
    is related to the adaptation of GCM-RCM model to local features; climate change
    influences runoff, but it has only a limited impact on long-term uncertainty.
  3: Long-term trends with socio-economic components are analyzed.
  9: Operators have taken advantage of glacier melting, increasing water volume; this
    trend will persist for the next 20 years. The reservoir helps mitigate runoff
    seasonality effects. Pumped-storage may increase energy production from 2040.
  10: Runoff initially increases slightly until 2040 before decreasing. GHG emission
    scenario has a low source of uncertainty in terms of runoff. The choice of GCM-RCM
    and downscaling method significantly impacts runoff forecasts. Studies based on
    few GCM-RCMs suffer of high epistemic uncertainty.
  11: Climate change affects mean annual revenue and variability in hydropower revenue,
    particularly significant in the period 2071-2100 due to glacier exhaustion.
  12: 'Different climate models (GCM-RCM ranges) lead to a wide range of revenue projections,
    highlighting epistemic uncertainty; the choice of downscaling method has a more
    significant impact than initial ice volume on revenue; Electricity price models
    don''t consider drift and are conservative. '
  14: Uncertainty in runoff evolves with time, shifting from variability-driven in
    the medium term (due to GHG emission scenarios) to epistemic in the long run (due
    to downscaling methods). Electricity price uncertainty follows the reverse trend,
    with epistemic uncertainty dominating in the medium term and variability in the
    long run. Revenue uncertainty is induced by both runoff and electricity price
    uncertainty.
  15: Price uncertainty is far more critical than runoff uncertainty for hydropower
    revenue. Scenario analysis and mixed methods are valuable in short-term management.
    Decision-makers must account for epistemic uncertainty and manage variability.
Methodology:
  1: A mixed-method approach, combining quantitative models and qualitative analysis,
    is used to assess the uncertainty related to hydropower revenue.
  2: Mixed methodology (integrating natural sciences and economics), qualitative analysis
    of uncertainty following the approach of Walker et al. (2003), simulations considering
    various parameters, scenarios, and models.
  3: Simulating future hydropower revenue using runoff, wholesale electricity prices,
    and supply schedules; an uncertainty matrix is developed. The model merges various
    submodels, identifying and discussing the level and nature of uncertainty at each
    location.
  5: Uses the Delta Change Method (DCM) and Empirical Distribution Delta Method (EDDM)
    to adapt GCM-RCM data to local situations. A glacio-hydrological model (GERM)
    is employed to assess the impact of climate change on runoff. Models are forced
    by daily temperature and precipitation time series from 1980-2100. Electricity
    prices are modeled using EEX German electricity spot prices.
  9: Model validated using historical data by comparing simulated hourly, weekly,
    and seasonal production with actual production and verifying lake level patterns.
    The study uses climate scenarios (A2, A1B, RCP3PD) and GCM-RCM models to project
    future temperature and precipitation.
  10: Analysis uses multiple GCM-RCMs and two downscaling methods (EDDM and DCM) to
    forecast runoff under different GHG emission scenarios. The analysis covers the
    periods 2021-2050 and 2071-2100.
  11: Price models validate against historical prices and analyze through mean reversion
    process with focus on seasonality, using a downscaling method impacting hydropower
    revenue projection.
  12: The study uses different RCM-GCMs, downscaling methods (DCM, EDDM, MRs, MRy,
    MRJD), and considers initial ice volume to project future electricity revenue
    under various GHG emission scenarios. The timeframe is up to 2100.
  14: Statistical methods (calibration techniques included) are used to determine
    parameters; a large panel of GCM-RCM is considered.
  15: The paper integrates runoff and electricity prices in a common framework to
    evaluate revenue and conducts an uncertainty analysis.
More Notes:
  1: The study emphasizes the importance of analyzing uncertainty through a large
    panel of models and datasets, which is rarely carried out.
  2: The paper investigates the uncertainties and their relationships, arguing that
    if climate change and power market fluctuations are considered independently,
    the overall impact and accumulated uncertainty cannot be evaluated; low-expected
    revenue and high uncertainty tend to jeopardize investment; the paper considers
    qualitative rather than purely quantitative uncertainty analysis.
  3: The paper uses a three-dimensional approach to analyze uncertainty, considering
    location, level, and nature. The study distinguishes between epistemic and variability
    uncertainty.
  5: The study considers the impact of climate change on interannual variability.
    The sensitivity of the results to initial ice volume is tested.
  9: The case study is based on the Mauvoisin hydropower plant in the Swiss Alps.
    The research investigates how scenarios and models affect climate, runoff, prices,
    and revenue.
  12: Annual revenue is not linearly related to annual runoff; Seasonality affects
    results; uncertainty brought by initial ice volume is not as high as uncertainty
    resulting from the downscaling method.
  14: The paper discusses the nature and level of uncertainty to inform who (scientists
    or decision-makers) should address the uncertainty and which tools (risk management
    methods or rational decision-making methods) should be considered.
  15: Specific tools must be developed to tackle uncertainty in hydropower, a capital-intensive
    technology with a long lifetime. Uncertainty, like forecasting, is case study
    and model related.

    MRJD) which are not directly linked to national-level macroeconomic/fiscal risks
    of climate change or the costs/benefits of adaptation. The models include components
    for ARMA, GARCH, mean-reversion, and jump diffusion. However, there is no discussion
    of adaptation strategies or the relation of these electricity price models to
