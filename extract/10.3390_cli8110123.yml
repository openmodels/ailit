Drivers of Risk:
  1: Floods and Droughts, measured using satellite data
  2: Floods and droughts
  3: Floods and droughts.
  4: Floods and droughts.
  6: Floods and droughts, specifically the area exposed to these hazards.
  7: Floods (driven by above average monsoon rainfall) and droughts (driven by below
    average monsoon rainfall).
  8: Flood and drought exposure in Indian states, associated with monsoon and non-monsoon
    rainfall deviations.
  10: Area exposed to floods (FLEA) and area exposed to droughts (DREA).
  11: Flood exposure, drought exposure, lagged flood exposure, and lagged drought
    exposure.
  12: Floods and droughts impact GDP and human development indicators, with floods
    impacting groundwater supply and droughts affecting water availability.
  13: Floods and droughts.
  14: Floods and droughts are the key climate-related risks.
  15: Flood exposure, Drought exposure, Over-exploitation of groundwater
Highlights:
  1: Floods expose a large area, but droughts have the most significant impact at
    the sub-national level. Floods have a positive impact and droughts have a negative
    impact on non-agriculture sector GSDP. No significant influence of floods or droughts
    on HDI was observed.
  2: This paper attempts to shift the focus from the national to the sub-national
    level assessments on the relationship between natural disasters and economic growth.
  4: The study assesses the trends of exposed areas and GSDP to floods and droughts;
    the state of Assam, located in the downstream of the Brahmaputra and the most
    affected by its floods, is included in the study.
  6: Flood-exposed area (FLEA) is the maximum area exposed to floods during a year,
    which is a good indicator of the extent of inundation.
  7: Flood and drought exposed areas influence the GSDP exposed to floods and droughts,
    and impact sectoral and total GSDP per person and HDI.
  8: Bihar and Assam have high flood exposure but reduced over two decades; Gujarat
    and Rajasthan had high drought exposure, but it decreased over time; infrastructure
    may mitigate drought but can increase flood exposure.
  10: Flood mitigation investments seem to have statistically significant impacts,
    especially in the ER and SWR.
  11: Flood exposure (FLEA) generally has a positive but not statistically significant
    impact on different sectors in different regions, with a significant favorable
    influence on the non-agriculture sector in the NWR. Drought exposure generally
    has a statistically significant negative impact on GSDP. Floods can enhance groundwater
    recharge, outweighing the costs in some regions.
  12: Non-agriculture sector GDP in some regions shows resilience or benefit in flood-exposed
    areas, while droughts generally pose negative impacts on HDI.
  13: Floods and droughts have varying impacts on different economic sectors and regions
    within India; Droughts generally impact GSDP in all states, but significantly
    only through the non-agriculture sector; Massive investments in flood mitigation
    and adaptation in the ER states boost its GDP and also the HDI.
  14: Floods and droughts have wide variation of impacts in different regions and
    states; droughts have significant spatial distribution and slow-developing impacts
    on agricultural and non-agriculture sectors; adaptation to droughts is the way
    forward for growth.
  15: Investments in flood mitigation and adaptation are critical for assisting livelihoods
    in ER states (with lowest GSDP and highest poverty), Diversification of economic
    activities boosts GSDP in SWR states, Additional storage, water diversions, groundwater
    recharge, and crop diversification can boost economic growth in central and northern
    states.
Methodology:
  1: Fixed-effect panel regression analyses using satellite data to estimate flood
    and drought exposure impact on GSDP and HDI in 19 Indian states from 2001-2015.
  2: Analysis uses gridded time-series information of floods and droughts exposed
    areas derived from fine-scale satellite data. The study considers 19 major states,
    which account for 95% of the total population and 93% of the national GDP in 2015.
  3: The study analyzes flood and drought trends in exposed areas and consequent damages.
    The fourth section analyzes the impacts of floods and droughts on per-capita GSDP
    and HDI. The study covers 19 states in India.
  4: Panel data analysis at the state level to evaluate the impacts of floods and
    droughts; grouping states based on geography, hydrogeology, and GSDP (Eastern
    Region, Southern and Western Region, Northern and Central Region, Northwestern
    Region).
  6: Employs flood inundation mapping algorithms, aided by digital elevation models
    (DEMs), to classify pixels into temporary flooded or permanent water bodies, estimating
    the Flood-Exposed Area (FLEA). The FLEA of a state is the total area of temporarily
    flooded pixels of 8-day MODIS images between 2001 and 2013.
  7: Econometric analysis using state and time fixed effect panel regression models.
    Analysis considers data from 2001 to 2015 for 19 states. Flood data is for 2003,
    2010, and 2013. Drought data is for 2002, 2009, and 2015.
  8: "Two-stage least-squares regression analysis, using rainfall deviations as instrumental\
    \ variables; tested with Wu\u2013Hausman, Wald, and Sargens tests."
  10: Time and state fixed panel regressions are used to analyze the relationship
    between flood/drought exposed areas and GSDP, with adjustments for endogeneity
    issues.
  11: Fixed effect panel regression analysis at the state level. NCR and SWR were
    treated as single regions due to similar per-capita GSDP. Considers current and
    lagged impacts of flood and drought exposure on per capita GSDP.
  12: Uses regressions with explanatory variables like percentage area exposed to
    floods and droughts to determine impacts on GDP and HDI.
  13: Analysis of the effects of floods and droughts on GSDP and HDI across different
    regions of India.
  14: State-level analysis of the intra-country impacts of floods and droughts.
More Notes:
  1: The paper argues for profiling disaster impacts at smaller sub-national units
    like districts for more effective mitigation and adaptation.
  2: Excluded from the analysis are union territories and northeastern states, where
    reliable data are not available.
  4: The study considers the differences in hydrogeology (alluvial vs. hard-rock aquifers)
    and their impact on water availability and use patterns in the agriculture sector
    across different regions.
  6: The analysis acknowledges that the intensity and duration of multiple floods
    in certain regions are not captured due to data limitations.
  7: The Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI) is used to identify drought-exposed
    pixels based on satellite imagery. The analysis also considers carry-over effects
    from previous year's flood and drought exposed areas.
  10: The impact of flood spread in drought-stricken areas on groundwater recharge
    might be hidden by aggregated state-level data.
  11: The analysis suggests that the impact of floods on groundwater recharge is critical
    for livelihood and economic activities in many states during the non-rainy period
    (8 months).
  12: There is a regional variation in how floods and droughts affect economic and
    human development outcomes.
  13: Even with recurrent and large floods, there is no significant adverse effect
    of exposure to floods on the overall GSDP and HDI of the ER states.
  14: Floods benefit local communities and have less distributional impact, while
    droughts have significant impacts on both agricultural and non-agricultural sectors
    across larger areas.
  15: The study acknowledges that the results are confounded by large intra-state
    variation and that spatially targeted interventions addressing mitigation and
    adaptation to floods and droughts is still not adequate. Future research should
    focus on profiling the risk of natural disasters at finer spatial resolution.
