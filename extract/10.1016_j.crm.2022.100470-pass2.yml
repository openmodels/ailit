Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea level rise due to climate change, specifically focusing on different Shared
    Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).
  2: Rising sea levels (SLR) and an increase in the occurrence of extreme events leading
    to flooding and coastal erosion.
  4: Different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) representing various emissions
    and mitigation scenarios; also ice sheet and thermal expansion.
  5: Sea level rise (SLR) projected under different IPCC Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
    (SSPs).
  7: Sea Level Rise (SLR) under SSP5-8.5 climate scenario is projected to cause potential
    land loss.
  8: Sea level rise (SLR) impacting populated areas; High percentage of population
    living in indigenous reservations or CCN territory; High poverty indicators in
    affected departments; High informal labor rates in affected departments.
  9: Sea level rise projected under different SSP scenarios by the IPCC; Tectonic
    activity or sediment compaction resulting in land subsidence on the Caribbean
    coast.
Highlights:
  1: A sea level rise of 1.04m in the worst-case scenario would threaten 2840.64 km2
    of land in Colombia, impacting 12 departments or 86 municipalities with different
    social, environmental, economic, and cultural conditions.
  4: Sea level rise projections vary significantly based on the SSP scenario, with
    SSP5-8.5 showing the highest projected rise and SSP1-1.9 the lowest. Buenaventura
    and Cartagena have similar patterns across the different SSPs, but specific projections
    and uncertainty ranges may differ slightly.
  5: The Caribbean Sea coastline is projected to experience a higher SLR and greater
    land loss than the Pacific Ocean coastline under all SSP scenarios.
  7: SLR could significantly affect food security and socio-economic activities because
    almost 10% of national GDP is tied to land-based activities.
  8: Reallocation of populations due to sea level rise, particularly in departments
    with significant indigenous and Afro-Colombian populations, presents complex social
    and financial challenges.
  9: The Pacific coast is projected to experience a milder increase in sea level than
    the Caribbean coast of Colombia.
Methodology:
  1: Used sea level rise projections published in August 2021 by the IPCC in the Sixth
    Assessment Report to identify areas at risk of land loss along the Caribbean and
    Pacific coastlines of Colombia, considering five SSPs. The analysis results are
    applicable for the 21st century.
  2: Analysis of potential land loss due to SLR using different IPCC scenarios, assessment
    of current land use in threatened areas, and a socio-economic discussion to delineate
    potential impact.
  4: The NASA Sea Level Projection Tool (based on IPCC 6th Assessment Report) is used
    to project SLR. The tool incorporates multiple SLR drivers. Tide gauge data is
    also used.
  5: Calculation of potential land loss on the Pacific and Caribbean Sea coast due
    to SLR based on projected SSP scenarios within the 100 km coastal region.
  7: The study estimates affected population based on current residents in potentially
    endangered areas and uses DANE reported GDP per capita by department as an estimate
    of purchasing power.
  9: "The study delineates potential land loss due to projected sea level rises under\
    \ different SSP scenarios, using a DEM with a resolution of 90 m \xD7 90 m. The\
    \ study uses sea level rise projections from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report\
    \ (2021) for two meteorological stations in Colombia and extrapolates them spatially\
    \ and temporally to the whole coastline. The analysis does not consider any mitigation\
    \ measures."
More Notes:
  1: The study identifies the land use in the affected zones and emphasizes the need
    to consider social, environmental, economic, and cultural conditions when devising
    and implementing mitigation policies.
  5: The paper notes potential reasons for the difference in SLR between the Caribbean
    and Pacific coasts may include natural factors such as tectonic activity and sediment
    compaction.
  7: The paper mentions that the study area includes wetlands that provide valuable
    ecosystem services. The authors note that SLR is expected to affect land that
    is dedicated to soil conservation.
  8: The paper highlights the potential for increased costs associated with adaptation
    and mitigation strategies due to the unique socio-economic and ethnic characteristics
    of certain regions within Colombia. The informal labor rates in affected departments
    may impede tax collection, thereby affecting the ability to fund adaptation strategies.
  9: The study acknowledges several limitations including the resolution of the DEM,
    the extrapolation of sea level rise data, and the exclusion of extreme waves and
    surges in the analysis. The results are considered a starting point for more precise
    calculations of environmental, ecological, and socio-economic consequences.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: The potential socio-economic implications of sea level rise in affected regions
    of Colombia.
  2: Potential impact of SLR with the associated land loss on the local population,
    specifically focusing on socio-economic consequences.

    scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5).

  7: Potential land loss due to sea level rise (SLR) may affect population and GDP
    per capita in affected departments.
  8: Financial cost of reallocating populations affected by sea level rise; Complexity
    and expense of reallocating populations in ethnic territories.

Quantitative material:
  1: Sea level rise of 1.04 m in the worst-case scenario (SSP5-8.5) would threaten
    an area of 2840.64 km2 in Colombia.

    and Cartagena under different SSPs.  The graphs also indicate the 17th-83rd percentile
    ranges of these projections. Tabulated values are mentioned to be reported in
    Table SM.1.

    agriculture, livestock, hunting, forestry and fishing represent almost 10 % of
    the national GDP.
