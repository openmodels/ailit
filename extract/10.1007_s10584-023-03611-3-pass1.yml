Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global temperature change (representative concentration pathways), country-specific
    economic development (economic growth and income distribution across the shared
    socioeconomic pathways), and climatic tipping points.
  2: Temperature change (operationalized using RCPs), economic cost of tipping points,
    technology (increasing economic activity and potentially mitigating emissions).
  3: Climate change, agricultural losses, reductions in yields, destruction of assets
    from climate-related disasters and shocks, increased temperature, health risks,
    hot days.
  7: Different SSP-RCP combinations (socioeconomic development pathways and climate
    pathways), with a focus on SSP5-RCP 8.5 and RCP 6.0. Temperature changes linked
    to these RCPs affect inequality and economic production.
  8: Challenges to mitigation and adaptation (represented by different SSP scenarios).
  9: Climate change scenarios (IFs-RCP 6.0, SSP1-RCP 2.6, SSP2-RCP 4.5, SSP3-RCP 6.0,
    SSP4-RCP 6.0, SSP5-RCP 8.5)
  10: Climate change, socioeconomic development, and emission levels (represented
    by SSP and RCP scenarios).
  11: Climate change, specifically through different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
    (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).
  12: Climate change scenarios including RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5.
Highlights:
  1: Climate-driven poverty increases are estimated to be lower than bottom-up approaches,
    suggesting macro-level approaches miss dynamics related to prices and consumption
    power. Tipping points are a significant threat. Income distribution improvements
    can mitigate long-term effects of climate change on poverty.
  2: The paper introduces alternative scenarios using the International Futures (IFs)
    modeling system to operationalize the relationship between temperature change,
    economic activity, and inequality, focusing on the impact on poverty.
  3: Climate change will remain a significant challenge for future patterns of socioeconomic
    development, with tens of millions pushed into poverty.
  8: Future GDP per capita increases most rapidly in SSP5 (high growth, high mitigation
    challenges) and least rapidly in SSP3 (high adaptation challenges). Income inequality
    is highest in scenarios with high adaptation challenges (SSP3 and SSP4) and lowest
    in scenarios with fewer adaptation challenges (SSP1 and SSP5). Population growth
    is highest in SSP3.
  9: Climate change is projected to reduce global economic growth across all scenarios,
    with GDP reduction ranging from -0.2% to -0.6% by 2030, -0.8% to -1.5% by 2050,
    and -0.8% to -3.2% by 2070. The increase in global inequality driven by temperature
    is projected to range from 0.01 to 0.016 in 2030, 0.022 to 0.042 in 2050, and
    0.023 to 0.074 in 2070.
  10: Climate change is projected to push millions more people into poverty, with
    the extent of the impact varying significantly based on different socioeconomic
    and emissions scenarios. Balancing socioeconomic development and climate change
    mitigation could minimize the number of people pushed into poverty by climate
    change.
  11: Climate change is projected to increase the number of people living in poverty.
    By 2070, nearly 40% of the population living on less than $1.90 per day will be
    attributable to climate change in an IFs-RCP 6.0 scenario.
  12: Significant GDP losses are projected under all scenarios, especially SSP5-RCP
    8.5, with losses reaching -$2,340.0 trillion by 2070.
Methodology:
  1: Uses the International Futures (IFs) model to project poverty across income thresholds
    for 175 countries through 2070, combining RCPs with economic growth and inequality
    series from SSPs.
  2: Uses the International Futures (IFs) modeling system and adjusts SSP scenarios
    modelling the future of economic growth and inequality for expected changes based
    on literature. Uses macro-level relationships which neglect micro-level dynamics.
  7: The study uses the International Futures (IFs) model, a six-sector general equilibrium
    model, to simulate the impact of climate change scenarios (RCPs) on economic outcomes.
    The model incorporates sector-specific labor, capital, total factor productivity,
    and utilization factor. It also models household income, consumption, savings,
    and poverty using a log-normal income distribution.
  8: Global forecasts are generated for different socioeconomic development scenarios
    (SSPs) with and without climate impacts.
  9: The analysis uses the DICE model damage function.
  10: The analysis uses SSP and RCP scenarios to project the number of people who
    are expected to fall into poverty due to climate change. The IFs model is used
    for RCP 6.0.
  11: The analysis uses different SSP-RCP scenarios (IFs-RCP 6.0, SSP1-RCP 2.6, SSP2-RCP
    4.5, SSP3-RCP 6.0, SSP4-RCP 6.0, and SSP5-RCP 8.5) to model the impact of climate
    change on poverty in 2030, 2050, and 2070.
  12: Usage of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) scenarios and simulations (IFs-RCP)
    for projections of GDP loss and climate-induced poverty under different RCP scenarios.
More Notes:
  1: The model considers the tension between fossil fuel-based economic development
    and climate change mitigation. Productivity gains can reduce poverty but increase
    climate change on a fossil fuel energy system.
  2: The authors acknowledge that by neglecting micro-level dynamics, they may be
    underestimating the impact of climate change on poverty. They also note they are
    missing pathways related to other environmental systems.
  8: The IFs scenario is most closely aligned with SSP3 and is the most pessimistic
    across the time horizon.
  9: The SSP scenarios represent different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways combined
    with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for climate forcing.
  11: The analysis also considers the potential impact of tipping points on GDP and
    poverty, though the results for tipping points are presented in Table 5 and Fig.
    5 (not included in this page).
  12: Analysis includes the effect of climate change on poverty, with specific focus
    on income inequality's influence on climate-attributable poverty.

    water stress exposure from -240 million to +150 million cases, and malaria exposure
    from 30.1 million to 58.5 million cases from cited papers, one day with temperatures

    degrees C by 2070; RCP 8.5: 22.4 degrees C by 2070.'
  8: GDP per capita reaches $97.4 thousand USD in SSP5, $69.7 thousand USD in SSP1,
    $48.8 thousand USD in SSP2, $39.6 thousand USD in SSP4, and $25.8 thousand USD
    in SSP3 by 2070; IFs reaches $33.5 thousand USD by 2070. Population reaches 11.3

  9: Table 2 provides the effect of climate change on global economic growth in trillions
    of US$ and percentage terms for 2030, 2050, and 2070 under different climate scenarios.
    Table 3 presents the impact of changing temperature on future levels of inequality
    (Gini coefficient) for 2030, 2050, and 2070 under different climate scenarios.
  10: By 2030, climate change is projected to push an additional 18-30 million people
    into extreme poverty. By 2050, under SSP1-RCP 2.6 (improved socioeconomic development
    and low emissions) shows an increase of 9 million people in poverty. The SSP3-RCP
    6.0 scenario leads to an increase in the number of people in poverty by 30 million
    by 2030, 78 million by 2050, and 130 million by 2070. The SSP5-RCP 8.5 scenario
    pushes an additional 24 million people into poverty by 2030, 20 million into poverty
    by 2050, and 39 million into poverty by 2070. Climate change may increase inequality
    by 2.4 to 4.3% in 2030, 5.5 to 12.7% by 2050, and 7.5 to 23.9% by 2070.
