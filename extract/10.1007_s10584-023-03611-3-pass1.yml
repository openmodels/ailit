Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global temperature change (representative concentration pathways)
  4: Rising temperatures, precipitation anomalies, climate tipping points (permafrost
    melt, ice sheet disintegration, Amazon die-back).
  5: Temperature and precipitation variation; climate change exacerbating inequality,
    directly and indirectly through agricultural activity.
  9: Climate change impacts are driving the outcomes in economic growth and inequality.
  10: Climate change, socioeconomic development, and emissions levels (represented
    by SSP and RCP scenarios).
  11: Climate change is identified as a driver, and the potential impact of tipping
    points in climatic systems is noted as having the capacity to further increase
    poverty levels.
  12: Climate change impacts, specifically RCP scenarios and surpassing climate tipping
    points.
  13: Climate change, income inequality.
  14: Temperature change, driven by climate change, is a driver of risk.
  15: Climate change, specifically under the SSP2-RCP 4.5 scenario (a 'middle-of-the-road'
    scenario).
Evaluation overview:
  1: Poverty, specifically the number of people living in poverty due to climate change.
  4: Impact of climate change on productivity and poverty, including effects on inequality.
  5: Examines the impact of temperature and precipitation variation on income disparities,
    focusing on the Gini coefficient as a measure of inequality.
  8: The paper evaluates the impact of different socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) on
    GDP per capita, income inequality (Gini index), population, and extreme poverty.
  9: The paper evaluates the effect of climate change on global economic growth and
    inequality.
  10: 'Global poverty measured in millions of people affected across different poverty
    levels (extreme: <$1.90/day, poverty: <$3.20/day, moderate: <$5.50/day).'
  11: The paper evaluates the effect of climate change on poverty across various income
    thresholds ($1.90, $3.20, $5.50) for future years 2030, 2050, and 2070.
  12: Global GDP loss and increases in extreme, general, and moderate poverty.
  13: Global climate-attributable poverty (under $1.90 per day).
  14: Economic growth and inequality are being evaluated as outcomes.
  15: The impact of climate change on extreme poverty, measured as the number of people
    living in extreme poverty.
Highlights:
  1: Forecasts of climate-driven poverty increases in this paper are lower than estimates
    made using bottom-up approaches. Tipping points are a significant threat to future
    socioeconomic development and drive significant increases in poverty across scenarios.
    Long-term effects of climate change on poverty could be mitigated with a sustained
    effort to improve income distribution.
  4: Climate change will increase inequalities between and within countries.
  5: Agricultural activity is identified as one of the most important channels through
    which climate change exacerbates income inequality, affecting both rural and urban
    populations.
  8: "Future levels of average per capita GDP increase most rapidly in SSP5. Income\
    \ distribution in the No Climate scenarios are the most unequal in worlds of high\
    \ challenges to adaptation, such as SSP3 and SSP4. SSP3 is the scenario with the\
    \ greatest population growth, increasing to 11.3 billion by 2070. Scenarios with\
    \ much lower population growth\u2014SSP1 and SSP5\u2014reflect global populations\
    \ that are declining by 2070."
  9: "Significant reduction in cumulative economic activity due to climate change,\
    \ with negative impacts estimated at $1.1\u20136.9 trillion by 2030, $17\u2013\
    65.7 trillion by 2050, and $78.8\u2013344.1 trillion by 2070."
  10: Climate change is projected to push millions more people into extreme poverty,
    with the extent depending on the specific socioeconomic and emissions scenario.
  11: By 2070, approximately 40% of the population living on less than $1.90 per day
    will be attributable to climate change in an IFs-RCP 6.0 scenario.
  12: Climate change is projected to cause significant global GDP loss and increases
    in poverty under various RCP scenarios. Reducing income inequality can offset
    climate-attributable poverty increases, with a 5% improvement needed in RCP 2.6
    to eliminate climate-attributable poverty.
  13: Climate change has a significant but uncertain impact on human development and
    poverty; mitigation and improved income distribution can reduce the burden on
    poverty.
  14: 'Technology plays a dual role: productivity improvements can exacerbate fossil
    fuel emissions, while renewable energy improvements can mitigate them. The paper
    aims to find a balance between socioeconomic development, technological development,
    and climate change.'
  15: Climate change, under a middle-of-the-road scenario, is projected to push an
    additional 40 million people into extreme poverty by 2050.
Methodology:
  1: The International Futures (IFs) model is used to project poverty across income
    thresholds for 175 countries through 2070, combining RCPs with economic growth
    and inequality series from the SSPs.
  4: Uses a damage function to gauge economic losses from worsening climate conditions,
    such as a rise in mean temperature.
  5: Uses SSPs, RCPs, and IFs to model economic production, income distribution, and
    population change for 175 countries from 2017 to 2070. Introduces damage functions
    and tipping points to capture the impacts of climate change on overall economic
    activity.
  7: RCP temperature scenarios modeled include RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5, with projected
    temperature increases evaluated up to 2070.
  9: Analysis based on the DICE model damage function, applied to different shared
    socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs).
  10: Uses SSP and RCP scenarios to project the number of people falling into poverty
    due to climate change from 2017 to 2069.
  11: The analysis includes numerical modeling under various Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSP) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), with some scenarios
    including the effect of potential climatic tipping points.
  12: IFs-RCP model is used to project GDP loss and poverty increases. Sensitivity
    analysis is performed by exogenously changing the Gini coefficient to assess the
    impact of income inequality. Results are applicable up to 2070.
  13: Analysis uses established macro-level relationships to analyze the impact of
    climate change on poverty across different countries and income thresholds, considering
    SSP-RCP combinations. Results are projected through 2070.
  14: The analysis relies on modeling, using damage functions and historical data
    on the relationship between temperature change and inequality.
  15: The analysis uses the IFs (International Futures) software platform. Replication

More Notes:
  1: The study acknowledges a tension between fossil fuel-based economic development
    (which alleviates poverty but causes climate change) and efforts to limit climate
    damage.
  8: The 'No Climate' scenarios are used as a baseline for comparison with scenarios
    that include climate impacts (mentioned, but not detailed on this page).
  9: The paper provides scenarios with few challenges to adaptation (SSP1 and SSP5)
    showing rapid decline in global poverty, while scenarios with greater challenges
    (SSP3 and SSP4) reflect slower poverty reduction.
  10: The study highlights the marginal difference between scenarios with and without
    climate impacts, not overall poverty trends.
  11: The document suggests incorporating shocks related to climatic tipping points
    to simulate worst-case scenarios, potentially increasing poverty numbers significantly.
  12: The analysis considers the cumulative effect of surpassing climate tipping points
    in addition to the RCP scenarios.
  14: The study acknowledges several limitations including the use of potentially
    overly broad damage functions, reliance on historical data from a period of limited
    climate change, lack of explicit sectoral analysis, omitting the relationship
    between energy/food prices and purchasing power, representing climate change only
    via temperature, a potentially flawed measure of human development, and inability
    to model shocks exceeding planetary boundaries.
  15: The paper highlights the need for policy makers to address a range of disruptive
    events, including climate change, to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG1,
    ending poverty).
Quantitative material:
  1: "Climate change-attributable extreme poverty will grow to 25 million people by\
    \ 2030 (range: 18 to 30), 40 million by 2050 (range: 9 to 78), and 32 million\
    \ by 2070 (range: 4 to 130). If climatic tipping points are passed, the climate-attributable\
    \ extreme poverty grows to 57 million people by 2030 (range: 40\u201372), 78 million\
    \ by 2050 (range: 18\u2013193), and 56 million by 2070 (range: 7\u2013306)."
  4: The study models the impact of tipping points on the social cost of carbon (SCC)
    for 180 countries, finding that if all tipping points are surpassed, the SCC will
    increase by about 25% by 2100.
  5: "A 1% increase in temperature raises the Gini coefficient for income inequality\
    \ by 0.5 points on a 0\u2013100-point scale."
  8: By 2070, per capita GDP grows to $97.4 thousand USD in SSP5, up from a 2017 value
    of $15.3 thousand. In SSP1, average income increases to $69.7 thousand USD by
    2070. SSP2 shows GDP per capita increasing to $48.8 thousand by the end of our
    time horizon. SSP4 growing to $39.6 thousand USD and SSP3 growing to $25.8 thousand
    USD by 2070. The IFs scenario growing to $33.5 thousand USD by 2070. Population
    in SSP3 increases to 11.3 billion by 2070. Both SSP2 and SSP4 models increased
    population that peaks by 2070 at 9.4 and 9.5 billion people, respectively.
  9: "The GDP reduction ranges from \u22120.2 to \u22120.6% by 2030, \u22120.8 to\
    \ \u22121.5% by 2050, and \u22120.8 to \u22123.2% by 2070; Gini inequality increases\
    \ range from 0.01 to 0.016 by 2030."
  10: 18-30 million people pushed into extreme poverty by 2030. SSP3-RCP 6.0 leads
    to an increase of 30 million by 2030, 78 million by 2050, and 130 million by 2070.
    SSP5-RCP 8.5 pushes an additional 24 million people into poverty by 2030, 20 million
    into poverty by 2050, and 39 million into poverty by 2070.
  11: Quantitative data is provided on the number of millions of people projected
    to fall below poverty thresholds under different climate scenarios (IFs-RCP 6.0,
    SSP1-RCP 2.6, etc.) for 2030, 2050, and 2070.
  12: Cumulative effect of tipping points on global GDP (trillions of 2011 US$) under
    different scenarios for 2030, 2050, and 2070. Climate-attributable increases in
    global poverty (millions of people) under different scenarios for extreme, general,
    and moderate poverty thresholds.
  13: Figures show global climate-attributable poverty under various RCP scenarios
    with reductions in global income inequality (one, five, ten, fifteen, and twenty
    percent). Under RCP 8.5, a fifteen percent reduction in income inequality would
    be necessary to mitigate poverty.
  15: The SSP2-RCP 4.5 scenario leads to an additional 40 million people in extreme
    poverty by 2050 relative to a world without climate change.
