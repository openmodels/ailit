Drivers of Risk:
  1: Restrictions on agricultural trade (cereal import dependency constraints) and
    climate change impacts on crop yields.
  4: Climate change impacts on crop yields and cereal import dependency.
  5: Global zero cereal import dependency and climate change impacts on crop yield.
  7: Constrained cereal trade (ID and IC scenarios) and climate change (CC and IC
    scenarios) impacts on agriculture, specifically influencing cereal production
    and trade.
  8: Cereal trade perturbations and climate change impacts are identified as major
    drivers affecting cereal production and consumption outcomes in different regions.
  9: Climate change impacts on land/cereal production values; global zero cereal import
    dependency; production expansion into costly land; dependence on cereal imports.
  10: Constrained cereal trade (import dependency), climate change impacts on crop
    yields
  11: Cereal trade constraints and climate change impacts are the primary drivers
    of changes in production, consumption, and trade.
  12: The drivers of risk are constrained cereal trade, climate change impacts (CC),
    and the interaction of the two (IC).
  13: Climate change impacts on crop yields and constrained cereal trade (import dependency
    constraints).
  14: Climate change impacts on crop yields, constraints on global cereal trade, and
    potential disruptions to supply chains (e.g., due to uncertainty or regional climate
    change impacts).
  15: Shocks or changes impacting outcomes include import dependency constraints and
    climate change, affecting agricultural production, trade, and resource scarcity.
Highlights:
  1: Most regions experience larger changes in cereal consumption due to cereal import
    dependency constraints than due to the impacts of climate change on agricultural
    yields.
  4: The potential decrease in participation in global cereal markets and the encouragement
    of domestic cereal production to meet consumption needs under the model constraints.
  5: Imposing zero cereal import dependency leads to large decreases in cereal trade,
    with smaller decreases in total cereal production and consumption. Climate change
    has a relatively small impact on global total cereal import quantity compared
    to the import dependency constraint.
  7: Regions that are major cereal exporters in the reference scenario (RF) show the
    largest decrease in cereal export in the trade restriction scenarios (ID and IC),
    while major cereal importers in RF show the largest decrease in cereal import
    in ID. Regions with more cereal imports than exports in RF increase cereal production
    and decrease cereal consumption in ID, with a resulting increase in price.
  8: Cereal trade changes have a larger impact on production and consumption than
    climate change in most regions except the USA.
  9: Climate impact assumptions affect each region's data differently. Orange circles
    tend to indicate regions with decreasing production areas, while blue suggests
    an increase.
  10: Constrained cereal trade and climate change impacts affect regional corn prices
    differently depending on the import dependency of the region; In high-importing
    regions, producers need higher domestic prices to stimulate domestic cereal production;
    USA and Brazil show a slight decrease in regional prices in ID compared to RF,
    while Western Africa and the Middle East show an increase, with the Middle East
    showing a larger increase; regional price of corn is higher for these four regions
    in CC than RF and in IC than ID; effects on prices from import dependency are
    much larger than from climate change in some regions.
  11: USA cereal exports expected to decline by over 80% in impacted scenarios; cereal
    production to decrease by up to 20.4% under climate change impacts.
  12: Climate change and trade constraints have significant impacts on agricultural
    production and trade in the Middle East. Constraining cereal trade leads to shifts
    in consumption patterns, with reduced cereal consumption offset by increased consumption
    of non-cereal crops.
  13: Climate change and trade constraints significantly impact trade revenue, producer
    revenue, and consumer food expenditure, with the direction and magnitude depending
    on whether regions are net importers or exporters. The Middle East shows large
    reductions in cereal net import expenditures, partially offset by increased non-cereal
    trade. USA cereal producer revenue is also significantly impacted by trade constraints.
    Water consumption patterns also shift due to these factors.
  14: Climate change and trade constraints have significant impacts on agriculture,
    bioenergy, and water, with varying regional effects. Cereal consumption decreases
    and non-cereal consumption increases in the USA and Brazil. In the Middle East,
    trade mitigates some negative climate change impacts on crop yields. US irrigation
    water use for non-cereal crops increases more under climate change than it decreases
    under import dependency. Corn ethanol production sees substantial changes due
    to both climate change and trade constraints, especially in the Middle East.
  15: Synergies and tradeoffs are revealed when systematically altering trade patterns
    and climate, showing region-specific costs and benefits across sectoral outcomes,
    with real-world implications depending on countries' actions to reduce import
    dependency.
Methodology:
  1: The study uses long-term projections to explore the consequences of individual
    and interactive effects of trade perturbations and climate change on agricultural-bioenergy-water
    systems.
  4: The analysis uses GCAM to model agricultural and trade dynamics, incorporating
    climate change impacts on crop yields using outputs from Hadley Centre Global
    Environmental Model and Persephone.
  5: 'The study uses the GCAM model to explore multi-sector dynamics related to agriculture,
    bioenergy, and water, considering scenarios with constrained cereal trade and
    climate change impacts up to 2050 in 5-year steps. Four scenarios are considered:
    Reference (RF), Import Dependency (ID), Climate Change (CC), and Import Dependency
    under Climate Change (IC).'
  7: 'The study uses four model scenarios (RF, ID, CC, IC) to project changes in cereal
    trade, production, consumption, and land allocation from 2015-2050. The results
    are presented for the global level and for four representative regions: USA, Brazil,
    Middle East, and Western Africa.'
  8: Analysis uses future projections for cereal import and export changes in 2050
    under scenarios related to constrained trade and climate impacts.
  9: Comparison of regions under different climate scenarios (no climate impact, +20%
    climate impact, -20% climate impact) in the 2050s. Using bubble plots to visualize
    cereal import dependency ratio (CIDR).
  10: The study uses a model to project regional corn prices under different scenarios
    (RF, ID, CC, IC) from 2015-2050.
  11: The analysis presents projected outcomes for the year 2050, comparing different
    scenarios related to cereal trade constraints and climate change impacts.

    cereal trade and climate change on agricultural markets. Results are for the Middle
    East in 2050.
  13: A modeling approach that simulates the combined effects of climate change and
    trade perturbations on agricultural markets, examining impacts on various economic
    and consumption measures. Applicable for assessing the effects of climate change
    and trade policies on agricultural trade, producer revenue, consumer expenditure,
    caloric consumption, and water consumption in specific regions.
  14: The study evaluates the individual and combined impacts of climate change and
    trade constraints on sectoral outcomes through 2050 using a global model. It uses
    one realization of climate change impacts on crop yields and one alternative trade
    perturbation scenario.
More Notes:
  1: The individual and interactive effects of trade and climate change vary greatly
    across regions, and are affected by regional ability to increase agricultural
    production.
  5: The study considers a global zero cereal import dependency constraint as a thought
    experiment to explore multi-sector dynamics, rather than quantifying a comprehensive
    range of potential global climate change impacts.
  7: The analysis focuses on the agricultural sector, specifically cereal crops, and
    does not directly link these changes to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. The
    CIDR is mentioned but not well-defined.
  9: Provides a visual representation of how domestic cereal consumption percentages
    relate to land/cereal production changes under various climate scenarios for different
    regions in the 2050s.
  10: The model considers a cereal domestic production credit, modeled as a subsidy
    to producers to increase production sufficiently to meet domestic demand.
  11: No additional notes specific to this page.
  14: The study focuses on exploring the relative impacts across regions rather than
    predicting future climate impacts or trade patterns. The insights are likely to
    be qualitatively similar under alternate impacts, though the magnitude may differ.

Quantitative material:
  1: Global cereal trade decreases ~50% in 2050 compared to the baseline under a zero
    import dependency ratio; cereal production and consumption decrease by 4%; global
    irrigation water consumption increases 3% in 2050; corn ethanol production decreases
    7% in 2050.
  5: Cereal production and consumption decrease of 3.1%-4.1% over 2025-2050 under
    Import Dependency scenario. Global total import of cereals decreases to nearly
    half in 2025 in the Import Dependency (ID) and Import Dependency under Climate
    Change (IC) scenarios relative to the Reference (RF) scenario.
  7: The graphs show global total import, consumption, and land allocation for cereal
    crops from 2015-2050 under four model scenarios (RF, ID, CC, IC). CIDR values
    for USA and Brazil (-14%) and Middle East and Western Africa (59% and 24% respectively)
    in 2015. Indication that in 2050 the CIDR is 2 percentage points higher in CC
    than RF for USA and Western Africa.
  8: Quantitative changes in cereal production and consumption are provided, such
    as -50% production and +100% consumption changes in Australia_NZ under certain
    scenarios.
  9: Percent change of domestic cereal production versus percent change of domestic
    cereal consumption under different climate change impacts.
  10: Graph showing regional corn prices (2015 dollars per kg) from 2015-2050 in 5-year
    intervals under different scenarios for USA, Brazil, Middle East, and Western
    Africa; RF CIDR of -14% for USA and Brazil, 24% for Western Africa, and 59% for
    Middle East in the base year
  11: Yes, detailed quantitative data on variables like cereal and non-cereal production,
    consumption, imports, exports, net trade revenue, and irrigation water consumption
    in 2050 for the USA under various scenarios.
  12: The table provides quantitative projections for the Middle East in 2050 for
    the key variables under reference case (RF), climate change (CC), and constrained
    cereal trade/climate change interaction (IC) scenarios. Percent changes compared
    to the reference case are included. Examples include changes in cereal production,
    consumption, trade revenue, and irrigation water consumption.
  13: Trade revenue loss in the USA is roughly 50% relative to the reference future
    (RF) under import dependency (ID), and roughly 30% under climate change (CC),
    and nearly 75% under combined impacts (IC). Reduction in cereal net import expenditures
    in the Middle East is 94% in ID, partially offset by increased trade expenditures
    for non-cereal crops, resulting in a total reduction in crop trade expenditures
    of 42%. Impact of import dependency on USA cereal producer revenue is -18% (directionally
    same as trade revenue -94%, but only one-fifth as large). Staple caloric consumption
    changes are less than 0.5% for both regions (USA and Middle East) and all scenarios.
    Irrigation water consumption decreases roughly 8% in the USA and increases 21%
    in the Middle East due to import dependency constraints.
  14: Corn ethanol production in the Middle East and USA is projected to decrease
    by -14% and -18%, respectively, under climate change (CC). Under import dependency
    constraints (ID), Middle East corn ethanol production decreases by 96% while the
    USA sees an 11% increase.
