  15: The page discusses the impact of constrained cereal trade and climate change
    on agricultural systems, focusing on the global trade quantity of cereals, production,

Highlights:
  1: Most regions experience larger changes in cereal consumption due to cereal import
    dependency constraints than due to the impacts of climate change on agricultural
    yields.
  2: Decreased global market participation due to a zero cereal import dependency
    strategy leads to reduced global cereal production and consumption, with effects
    stronger than those of climate change. Enforcement of zero import-dependence exacerbates
    climate change effects in regions with higher import dependence.
  3: The study analyzes the linkages embedded in coupled systems using an extreme
    scenario of zero cereal imports as a thought experiment, not as a specific policy
    analysis.
  5: Climate change impacts have a small effect on global total cereal import quantity
    compared to the effect of the Import Dependency constraint.
  6: Climate change and import dependency constraints negatively impact global cereal
    consumption. The combined impact is roughly additive. Climate change leads to
    increased land allocation to cereal crops due to negative impacts on yields, counteracting
    the decrease from import dependency constraints.
  7: Global trade restrictions (ID scenario) lead to a decrease in cereal exports
    from major exporting regions (USA, Brazil, Argentina, Australia_NZ) and a decrease
    in cereal imports in major importing regions (Middle East, Northern and Western
    Africa). Regions that are cereal importers in the reference scenario increase
    cereal production and decrease consumption in the ID scenario, with a resulting
    increase in price. The reverse is true for cereal exporters in the reference scenario.
  8: Trade perturbations generally have larger impacts on cereal production and consumption
    changes compared to climate impact alone.
  9: Regions with RF CIDR>0% see production expand into more costly land, increasing
    prices in ID. Regions not dependent on cereal imports in RF see lower production
    and land contraction in ID, reducing prices.
  10: Climate change impacts on prices are comparable to import dependency constraints
    in the USA and Brazil, while in the Middle East and Western Africa, import dependency
    constraint effects dominate.
  11: The study highlights significant potential impacts on US agriculture in 2050,
    including decreases in cereal production and exports, changes in consumption patterns,
    and reductions in net trade revenue, under different scenarios of climate change
    and trade constraints.
  12: Key findings include significant changes in cereal exports and imports, net
    trade revenue reduction, and an increase in non-cereal consumption, production,
    and imports, with substantial variability under different scenarios such as ID,
    CC, and IC.
  14: Climate change and trade constraints significantly impact crop consumption,
    irrigation water use, and ethanol production, with varying regional effects. The
    Middle East is particularly vulnerable to trade restrictions due to cereal scarcity,
    while the USA, a major corn exporter, experiences different outcomes related to
    ethanol production.
  15: Import dependency constraints amplify susceptibility to domestic shocks, potentially
    reduce sensitivity to international supply chain fluctuations, and could negatively
    impact economic well-being and resource scarcity. Climate change impacts on agricultural
    yields also have significant effects.
Methodology:
  1: Systematic perturbations in two dimensions, one human (restrictions on agricultural
    trade) and the other physical (climate impacts on crop yields).
  2: The analysis is performed using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM v5.3)
    to study interactions of agricultural systems under international trade and climate
    change scenarios from 2015 to 2050.
  3: The study uses a modified version of GCAM 5.3, an open-source global-scale integrated
    assessment model. GCAM simulates economic decisions and interactions between multiple
    systems, operating at 32 geopolitical regions for energy and economic systems
    and 384 regions for water and land. The model includes price-induced intensification
    (e.g., irrigation) and models international trade for agricultural commodities
    among regions. The model calibration period is from 1975 to 2015, with projections
    made through 2100 in 5-year time steps.
  5: The scenarios consider a global zero cereal import dependency constraint imposed
    in 2025 and climate change impacts on crop yield beginning in 2020.
  6: The analysis uses GCAM (Global Change Assessment Model). The model base year
    is 2015, and projections are made for 2050. Scenarios considered include a Reference
    Future (RF), Import Dependency constraint (ID), Climate Change (CC), and Import
    Constraint and Climate Change combined (IC).
  7: 'The analysis uses four model scenarios (RF, ID, CC, IC) to project changes in
    cereal trade, production, consumption, and land allocation to cereal crops over
    the period 2015-2050 in 5-year time steps. The regional differences are explored
    by selecting four representative regions to evaluate the results in more detail:
    USA, Brazil, Middle East, and Western Africa. The paper utilizes a measure of
    the comparative import disadvantage ratio (CIDR).'
  8: The analysis compares scenarios of trade perturbations and climate change impacts
    on cereal production and consumption.
  9: Compares scenarios ID (global zero cereal import dependency), CC (climate change),
    and IC (interaction of the prior two) to RF (reference) in 2050. Bubble size indicates
    cereal import dependency ratio.
  10: The analysis models cereal domestic production credit as a subsidy to producers
    and evaluates scenario outcomes using line graphs by region from 2020 to 2050.
  11: The analysis uses scenarios denoted RF, ID, CC, and IC. The exact meanings of
    these scenario acronyms and the modeling framework are not explained on this page
    but are available elsewhere in the paper. The results are projections for the
    year 2050.
  14: The study analyzes the individual and combined impacts of climate change and
    trade constraints on multiple sectoral outcomes through 2050. The study uses one
    realization of climate change impacts on crop yields and one alternative trade
    perturbation scenario.
More Notes:
  1: The individual and interactive effects of trade perturbations and climate change
    vary greatly across regions, which are also affected by the regional ability to
    increase agricultural production through intensification or extensification.
  3: The paper models 11 aggregate crop commodities in GCAM v5.3, including four cereal
    commodities (corn, rice, wheat, and other grains). The food demand model is based
    on neoclassical economics and includes income and price elasticities that evolve
    as income varies.
  5: The zero cereal import dependency constraint is presented as a thought experiment
    for exploring the multi-sector dynamics.
  6: The figure descriptions in the paper present the cereal import dependency ratio
    (CIDR) for 2015.
  7: The acronyms RF, ID, CC, and IC represent different model scenarios, but the
    manuscript does not define what these scenarios stand for on this page. The paper
    references figures in the supplementary material (S1 File) which are not included
    in the text provided.
  8: The visual chart in Fig 3 indicates specific regional trade flow changes and
    their magnitude through color coding and arc thickness.
  9: The plots visually convey how changes in domestic cereal consumption correlate
    with production, import dependencies, and population growth across various regions.
    The division into color-coded groups highlights regions with significantly different
    CIDR metrics.
  11: The table includes data for both cereals and non-cereal crops, allowing for
    a comparison of their respective responses to the different scenarios. The study
    also analyzes the impact on corn ethanol production and consumption.
Quantitative material:
  1: Global trade of cereals decreases ~50% in 2050 compared to the baseline with
    smaller decreases in cereal production and consumption (4%). Global irrigation
    water consumption increases 3% and corn ethanol production decreases 7% in 2050.
  3: No relevant information
  5: "Total cereal production and consumption decrease only 3.1%-4.1% over the 2025\u2013\
    2050 period in ID scenario."
  6: Global cereal consumption decrease in 2050 due to climate change is about 3.5%
    compared to a reference future. The combined impact of import constraint and climate
    change on global cereal consumption is roughly a 7.5% decrease. The import dependency
    constraint decreases global land allocated to cereal crops by 3.6% on average.
  7: CIDR (Comparative Import Disadvantage Ratio) values are provided for USA, Brazil,
    Middle East, and Western Africa in 2015. The CIDR change in 2050 relative to the
    reference case (RF) is quantified for these regions. Global total import, consumption,
    and land allocation for cereal crops are quantified over 2015-2050 under four
    model scenarios.
  8: USA shows a -12% change in cereal production and a +9% change in cereal consumption
    due to trade impact by 2050; changes are about additive in combined scenarios.

    cereal consumption; Cereal Import Dependency Ratio (CIDR); Human Population Growth
    %; Cereal Imports /Production %
  10: Regional Fertilizer Carbon Intensity Displacement Rates (CIDR) is presented
    with values (e.g., USA and Brazil with RF CIDR of -14%, Western Africa with RF
    CIDR of 24%, Middle East with RF CIDR of 59%).
  11: The table presents quantitative results for the USA in 2050, including percent
    changes compared to a baseline scenario (RF) for various key variables, such as
    cereal and non-cereal production, consumption, exports, imports, net trade revenue,
    producer's revenue, caloric consumption, irrigation water consumption and ethanol
    production.
  12: Provides quantitative data on various agricultural metrics, including percent
    changes for import dependency ratios, production, consumption, exports, imports,
    net trade revenue, crop producers' revenue, caloric consumption, food expenditures,
    irrigation water consumption, and ethanol production.
  14: Cereal crop consumption decreases, while non-cereal crop consumption increases
    in the USA and Brazil. In the Middle East and USA, corn ethanol production changes
    by -14% and -18% respectively under climate change (CC). With import dependency
    (ID) the change is 96% decrease in the Middle East and an 11% increase in USA.
  15: The global trade quantity of cereals decreases to almost half of the baseline
    quantity under global zero cereal import dependency. Total irrigation water consumption
    in the Middle East increases by 21% under import dependency constraints and 0.7%
    under climate change, resulting in a 22% increase under both.
