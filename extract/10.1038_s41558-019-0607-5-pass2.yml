Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate-related damages impacting global banking stability, reducing banks' balance
    sheets, and contributing to economic instability.
  3: Climate change impacts on labor productivity and capital stock. Financial crises
    in the banking system exacerbating downturns. Non-performing loans due to climate-induced
    firm bankruptcies. Temperature anomaly.
  4: Climate damages affecting firms' solvency and workers' productivity, leading
    to non-performing loans and financial instability.
  5: Climate change impacts leading to labour and capital damages, financial distress,
    temperature anomaly at 2100, banks' allowance to lend.
  7: Anthropogenic emissions leading to temperature increases, which in turn cause
    damages to firms' labor or capital production factors, leading to bankruptcies
    and financial instability.
Highlights:
  2: Increasing banking crises frequency due to climate change, significant fiscal
    burden from bank bailouts, underestimation of climate impacts if financial system
    is omitted, moderate mitigation by macroprudential regulation.
  3: Climate change negatively impacts economic growth, driven by damages to labor
    productivity and capital stock, leading to increased bank bailouts and public
    debt. Financial distress accounts for a significant portion of the growth reduction,
    and macroprudential regulation plays a pivotal role in climate risk management.
  4: Climate change can significantly impact financial stability, potentially leading
    to substantial bailout costs (30% of GDP in SSP5 scenario) and increased public
    debt. Banking systems can amplify damages. Climate damages affecting the microeconomic
    behaviour of firms and workers cause a significant amount of additional non-performing
    loans, threatening solvency of financial institutions.
  5: Climate change leads to labour and capital damages and can induce financial distress,
    affecting global GDP growth. Climate change can induce bank bailouts, resulting
    in public costs (as % of GDP) which are impacted by bank lending allowances and
    temperature anomalies at 2100.
  7: The major modelling innovation is the inclusion of a financial system of multiple
    heterogeneous banks. The paper isolates the effects of climate-induced financial
    instability. It estimates the public costs of banking fragility associated with
    climate change under a business-as-usual scenario.
Methodology:
  2: "Agent-based climate\u2013macroeconomic model calibrated on stylized facts, future\
    \ scenarios, and climate impact functions; includes simulation of heterogeneous\
    \ economic agents."
  3: Monte Carlo simulation with 500 runs to analyze macroeconomic, financial, and
    climate indicators under different climate impact scenarios and SSPs. The analysis
    appears to look at long-term trends from the present to 2100.
  4: "Model simulations (500 runs) projecting climate-induced effects on the banking\
    \ sector and public finances under different scenarios (capital stock damages,\
    \ labour productivity damages, and labour and capital damages). 10-year averages\
    \ are reported. Comparison is made against a baseline with no climate change.\
    \ Robustness tests are also done and Supplementary results are provided. The model\
    \ accounts for climate damages on firms\u2019 solvency."
  5: "Simulations are performed for 25-year periods from 2000 to 2099. A parameter\
    \ space is constructed using \xB110% ranges around baseline values and randomly\
    \ sampled 100 times. For each combination of parameter values, a Monte Carlo exercise\
    \ of 100 runs is performed. A Gaussian kernel density plot is provided for each\
    \ clustered 25-year period of GDP growth."
  7: "The paper uses a Dystopian Schumpeter meeting Keynes (DSK) agent-based simulation\
    \ model calibrated on a SSP5\u2013RCP8.5 scenario. It performs Monte Carlo analyses\
    \ with 500 model runs to generate average results. The model is calibrated on\
    \ a coupled SSP5\u2013Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario.\
    \ The model is validated through stylized fact replication at both the microeconomic\
    \ and macroeconomic levels."
More Notes:
  3: The paper compares scenarios with different climate impacts (labor productivity,
    capital stock) and SSPs to a baseline scenario without climate change. There is
    evidence of a non-linear relationship between bailouts and GDP losses.
  4: Counter-cyclical capital buffers may not be effective when damages surge. The
    results might overestimate bailout costs because of a baseline with relatively
    many crises, and also completely neglect extraordinar y support from the government
    to absorb losses. Contractionary fiscal policy is inadequate in restoring financial
    stability.
  7: The model does not allow for analytical, closed-form solutions due to non-linearities.
    The government bails out insolvent banks. Contagion effects due to interbank exposure
    are absent, potentially leading to an underestimation of costs.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: "Climate change increases frequency of banking crises by 26\u2013248%, adds a\
    \ fiscal burden of about 5\u201315% of GDP per year, and doubles the public debt\
    \ to GDP ratio."
  3: "GDP growth, firm insolvency likelihood, banks\u2019 equity-to-total asset ratio,\
    \ public bailouts per 10 years, cost of bailouts per year (% GDP), average debt-to-GDP\
    \ ratio."
  4: Average number of bailouts, bailout costs as a share of GDP, public debt-to-GDP
    ratio.
  5: Global GDP growth rate, public costs of bank bailouts (as % of GDP).
  7: The paper evaluates the impacts of climate change on the financial system and
    the real economy, focusing on potential banking crises, credit crunches, and macroeconomic
    dynamics like output losses and productivity growth. It also considers the public
    cost of bailing out insolvent banks.
Quantitative material:
  2: "Estimated increase in frequency of banking crises (26\u2013248%), fiscal burden\
    \ increase (5\u201315% of GDP per year), public debt to GDP ratio doubling."
  3: GDP growth reduction to 2.0-2.9% from 3.5% in the baseline. Firm insolvency likelihood
    increases to 32.4-38.8% from 15.2%. Cost of bailouts increase to 15.7-25.0% of
    GDP from 10.3%. Debt-to-GDP ratio increases to 1.38-1.77 from 0.83. Public bailout
    frequency increases by a factor of 1.52 to 2.43. In an SSP1 future, firm insolvency
    increases by 33% and bailout frequency increases by 9%. In an SSP1 future, the
    ratio of public debt to GDP averages 250% in the year 2100. 20% of growth rate
    reduction is attributable to financial distress. Public costs of climate-induced
    bailouts increase approximately linearly with temperature anomaly.
  4: Yearly average bailout costs of 30% of GDP in an SSP5 future, compared to 10.3%
    with no climate change. Historical average of 3.5 financial crises per year globally
    with fiscal costs averaging 12% of GDP.

    \ 25\u2009yr period in the baseline scenario with no climate change and in the\
    \ scenario with labour and capital damages. Fig. 2 also shows Box plots of yearly\
    \ growth rates in the labour and capital damages scenario in the presence and\
    \ absence of financial distress. Fig. 3 shows public costs of bank bailouts (as\
    \ % of GDP) in the baseline scenario in the absence of climate change damages\
    \ and in the scenario with both labour and capital damages, depending on banks'\
    \ allowance to lend and temperature anomaly at 2100."
  7: "The model uses a quadratic damage function calibrated on the DICE 2016R model,\
    \ with c1 = 0 and c2 = 0.0022. This implies damages of 2.1% at +3\xB0C and 8.5%\
    \ at +6\xB0C. It also assumes a temperature rise of 1.8\xB0C for each emitted\
    \ 1,000 GtC."
