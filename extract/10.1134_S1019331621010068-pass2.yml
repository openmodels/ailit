Drivers of Risk:
  2: Global climate change leading to permafrost thawing and degradation in the Russian
    Arctic.
  3: "Permafrost thawing and degradation, leading to decreased bearing capacity of\
    \ foundation piles and deformation of building structures. A 2\xB0C increase in\
    \ average annual air temperature cuts in half the bearing capacity of foundation\
    \ piles."
  4: Permafrost thawing and degradation.
  5: Permafrost thawing and degradation effects on the sustainability of residential
    buildings; Global climatic changes leading to increased surface air temperature
  6: Permafrost temperature and thaw depth, leading to decreased bearing capacity
    of soils.
  7: Degradation of housing and infrastructure; Thawing permafrost
  8: Permafrost degradation due to global climate change (warming and thawing), decrease
    in bearing capacity of permafrost soils.
Highlights:
  2: "Permafrost degradation in the Russian Arctic will result in significant costs\
    \ for housing maintenance and restoration, potentially exceeding \u20BD36 bln\
    \ annually."
  3: Permafrost thaw is causing damage to housing stock in the Russian Arctic, with
    significant implications for the stability of buildings and infrastructure. The
    Russian Arctic has a high degree of urbanization, with about 80% of residents
    living in urban settlements.
  4: The study aims to determine the expected loss in the housing stock due to permafrost
    degradation in Russian Arctic regions up to 2050.
  5: The paper forecasts housing stock growth in Russian Arctic regions up to 2050
    under different scenarios, considering the impact of permafrost degradation due
    to climate change. The worst-case climate scenario (RCP8.5) is used to assess
    maximum risks.
  6: Permafrost degradation poses a significant economic risk to housing stock in
    Russian regions, potentially leading to losses of hundreds of billions to trillions
    of rubles by 2050.
  7: Significant economic losses are projected from both housing/infrastructure degradation
    and permafrost thaw.
  8: Permafrost degradation poses significant economic risks in the Russian Arctic,
    particularly to the housing sector; The Yamalo-Nenets AO and the Republic of Sakha
    (Yakutia) will suffer the greatest losses; Significant additional housing construction
    is required to address the issue, along with technical modernization of the construction
    industry.
Methodology:
  2: Economic assessment and forecasting of permafrost thawing consequences on the
    housing sector in eight regions of the Russian Arctic using the RCP 8.5 scenario
    from the IPCC, applied from 2020-2050.
  4: Economic assessment based on the total size of the housing stock and the actual
    cost of housing construction in each region. Calculations use Rosstat data on
    construction costs and IPA data on permafrost zones.
  5: Two scenarios (conservative and modernization) are used to forecast housing stock
    growth. The conservative scenario assumes preservation of construction and retirement
    rates from 2008-2018. The modernization scenario uses data from the 'Housing and
    Urban Environment' project for 2018-2024. Six global climate models were used
    to assess the impact of permafrost thawing on residential buildings. The RCP8.5
    climate change scenario was used as the basis for calculations.
  6: The study uses Rosstat data and authors' estimates based on construction costs
    per square meter to determine housing stock value; Geotechnical models of permafrost
    changes were used to assess the decrease in the bearing capacity of soils; Expected
    loss estimates are provided for the period up to 2050, based on minimum, average,
    and maximum loss of bearing capacity scenarios.
  7: The analysis projects economic losses between 2020 and 2050
  8: Forecast period 2020-2050, scenarios of average and maximum increase of thaw
    depth and permafrost temperature. Cost calculations based on permafrost degradation
    dynamics and its impact on housing stock.
More Notes:
  2: "Maximum expected losses are predicted in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug\
    \ and Krasnoyarsk krai, while minimum losses are expected in the Chukotka and\
    \ Khanty\u2013Mansi autonomous okrugs."
  3: The article attempts to assess the impact of permafrost thawing and degradation
    on the housing sector in the Russian Arctic.
  4: The assessment assumes a conditionally constant population until 2050 and disregards
    factors like housing demand/supply, living standards, and bank rates due to the
    lack of long-term forecasts. The planning horizon for housing development is medium-term
    (2019-2025), and the area of the housing stock is assumed to remain unchanged
    from 2025-2050
  5: The analysis focuses on the impact of climate change on housing stock sustainability
    in the Russian Arctic, using housing growth and decay estimates. The study explicitly
    uses different climate models.
  6: The housing stock is almost completely built on permafrost in Nenets, Yamalo-Nenets,
    and Chukotka autonomous okrugs, and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) and Magadan
    Oblast.
  7: The numbers are presented as ranges, potentially representing different scenarios
    or uncertainty bounds.
  8: The analysis does not take into account indirect costs, such as reserve housing
    construction or temporary evacuation of residents. The study emphasizes the need
    for preventative measures and adaptation strategies by the federal government
    and regional authorities.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Annual average cost of maintenance and restoration of lost housing stock in the
    Russian Arctic due to permafrost degradation.

Quantitative material:
  2: "Under a conservative scenario, the annual average cost will exceed \u20BD30\
    \ bln (Russian Rubles). With modernization, the cost increases to \u20BD36 bln\
    \ annually between 2020-2050."
  3: Housing stock in the eight Russian Arctic regions under consideration amounted
    to 170 million square meters in 2018.  About 4.7% of the total area of residential
    premises in Russia are in the eight Russian Arctic regions under consideration.
    In Norilsk, more than 300 houses had to be demolished due to deformation of building
    structures.
  4: Formulas (1) and (2) are provided for calculating the size and cost of housing
    stock built on permafrost. Assumptions include 90% of housing in continuous permafrost
    zone, 50% in discontinuous, 10% in massive-island, and 0% in sporadic zones.
  5: Forecast of housing stock growth dynamics in Russian Arctic regions for the period
    up to 2050, % of the baseline 2018 (see Table 2 in source document)
  6: "In 2018, 20.6 million square meters of housing stock in the regions, with a\
    \ total cost of \u20BD4.1 trillion, were built on permafrost; Expected loss from\
    \ permafrost degradation for 2020\u20132050 is estimated between \u20BD420 billion\
    \ and \u20BD2.5 trillion (conservative scenario), and is expected to reach \u20BD\
    907 billion based on the average scenario (18.8% of the total cost of housing\
    \ built on permafrost)."
  7: Economic losses from housing and infrastructure degradation in 2020-2050 are
    estimated with a range of values, for example, 89.7/89.7 billion rubles. Economic
    losses from thawing permafrost in 2020-2050 are estimated with a range of values,
    for example, 88.8/88.8 billion rubles.
  8: "Annual costs of maintaining housing stock: \u20BD30 bln (0.25% of GRP in 2018\
    \ prices) increasing to \u20BD95 bln (almost 1% of GRP) under maximum thaw scenario;\
    \ Yamalo-Nenets AO loss: \u20BD416.5 bln; Chukotka AO loss: \u20BD753.1 mln; Republic\
    \ of Sakha (Yakutia) loss: \u20BD1.7 trillion under maximum decrease in bearing\
    \ capacity; Cost of housing stock loss from \u20BD500 bln to \u20BD3.36 trillion\
    \ depending on changes in permafrost temperature and thaw depth; Average annual\
    \ loss due to permafrost thawing (2020-2050) is \u20BD36.26 bln (0.29% of GRP\
    \ in 2018 prices) with average change or \u20BD112 bln with maximum change; additional\
    \ housing construction needed: 243,000 m2 annually or 1.5 mln square meters with\
    \ maximum degradation; doubling the current construction capacity would require\
    \ \u20BD1.08 trillion."
