  45: The outcome being evaluated is log real GDP per capita.
  47: The analysis focuses on changes in energy demand (oil, gas, natural gas, and
    electricity) as a result of climate change.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change has a regressive impact on energy demand, with the incidence of
    increased energy demand overwhelmingly falling on low-and middle-income countries,
    raising the question whether climate change could exacerbate energy poverty.
  2: The current literature is limited by a lack of understanding of the heterogeneous
    responsiveness of energy demand to meteorology across regions and sectors, and
    the interaction of these responses with changing temperature fields. Empirical
    assessments at broad geographic scales are rare. The literature's coverage of
    combinations of different sectors and fuels is also limited, focusing on electricity
    and natural gas in the residential sector.
  3: A critical issue in projecting future climate impacts is consistently aggregating
    current and future meteorological data across spatial and temporal scales, because
    averaging ESM outputs shrinks the tails of the distribution of meteorological
    drivers, which understates the large impacts that are likely to arise when nonlinear
    demand responses are convolved with exposure to weather extremes.
  5: Energy response functions exhibit a generalized V-shape.
  6: The paper addresses the dichotomy between intensive and extensive margins of
    energy demand by using an error correction model. The model considers adaptation
    responses beyond just changes in energy consumption conditional on existing energy-using
    goods, including adjustments in the capital stock and energy efficiency over longer
    time horizons.
  9: The formulation captures potential nonlinearity in the demand response to weather
    and more precisely resolves the effects of extreme heat and humidity relative
    to alternative specifications.
  10: The paper projects future impacts on energy demand circa 2050 using climate
    change scenarios.
  11: The majority of grid cells will experience increased frequency of hot days and
    decreased frequency of cold days. Geographic incidence is uneven, with tropics
    seeing more hot days and temperate regions seeing a greater decrease in cold days.
    The sign and magnitude of country-specific final energy demand consequences is
    an empirical question, balancing increased cooling with decreased heating.
  12: "Tropical and subtropical regions are projected to experience the most significant\
    \ increases in the frequency of hot days (T > 27.5\xB0C) under the RCP8.5 scenario.\
    \ Large parts of North America, Europe, and Asia are projected to experience a\
    \ decrease in the frequency of cold days (T < 12.5\xB0C) under the RCP8.5 scenario."
  13: A method for projecting future energy demand changes at the grid cell level,
    considering both economic growth and climate impacts, is introduced.
  14: Table 2 summarizes the estimated long-run semi-elasticities of per capita energy
    final energy consumption to daily temperature exposure.
  15: Cooling energy demand in response to greater exposure to hot days is entirely
    satisfied by electricity, whereas the corresponding heating response is distributed
    among all fuels in temperate regions, and concentrated in fuel oil in the tropics;
    Demand responses of each fuel to heat and cold exposures are asymmetric; Energy
    consumption is generally income elastic outside of the agriculture sector, with
    the exception of industrial fuel oil in the tropics and residential electricity
    in temperate countries
  16: Without climate change, total weather-sensitive energy demand can be expected
    to reach 502 EJ, an almost five-fold increase over 2010. The 2050 fuel mix is
    more skewed toward electricity (68%).
  17: Emerging economies in the tropics will see a ninefold increase in energy consumption,
    while advanced nations at high latitudes will see a quadrupling. The largest spatial
    overlap in energy use is in zones exposed to either moderate declines in cold
    days or slight increases in hot days. The distribution of energy consumption exposure
    to growth in high temperatures exhibits a long upper tail, with small quantities
    of energy use exposed to a wide range of percentage increases in heat.
  18: The maps highlight that different global regions will experience varying changes
    in energy demand, with areas like North America, Europe, and Asia showing mixed
    results, and Africa and South America tending towards increased energy consumption.
  19: Positive changes in energy demand are concentrated in developing and industrializing
    economies in tropical areas. Impacts at the global level are regressive, with
    low-and-middle-income countries experiencing increases in energy consumption.
  20: Impacts on aggregate energy consumption are mostly negative in advanced countries,
    and mostly positive in developing nations; South America, Asia and Africa see
    ubiquitous increases in demand, while Europe, North America and Oceania exhibit
    mixed responses but with consistent reductions in the residential sector.
  21: The chart highlights sectoral differences in energy consumption responses to
    warming scenarios, particularly across categories like agriculture, commercial,
    industrial, and residential.
  22: "Climate change is expected to increase global demand for energy, but this shift\
    \ is of secondary importance compared with the effect of economic expansion; Tropical\
    \ countries account for most of the increase in energy consumption above BaU levels;\
    \ The near-zero effects in Table 4.A re\uFB02ect the potential for small increases\
    \ or declines, to the tune of -1.2% to 2.2% (2.5% to 3.8%) of current world energy\
    \ consumption in the RCP 4.5 (RCP 8.5) scenario."
  23: Under both RCP scenarios, total energy demand responses vary across sectors
    and regions, with some sectors showing increased demand and others showing decreased
    demand.  The industrial sector and the residential sector tend to have the largest
    magnitude shifts in demand in the circa 2050 analysis.  The Commercial sector
    tends to have decreased Natural Gas demand.
  24: Uncertainty in combined GDP and temperature responses leads to a wide range
    of potential changes in energy demand, notably a 7.5-19.3% increase under rapid
    warming.
  25: Dynamic modeling approach provides different elasticity estimates than static
    or first-difference models. Static and first-difference models may overstate or
    understate long run impacts.
  26: Including energy prices reduces the speed of adjustment toward temperature-related
    impacts.
  27: Climate change is expected to increase global demand for energy, but its impact
    is of secondary importance relative to economic growth. Price-driven energy demand
    adjustments may have masked about 13% of the long-run impact of heat in temperate
    countries. Residential electricity impacts in temperate countries should be interpreted
    as a lower bound.
  28: The chart compares the magnitude and distribution of economic variables across
    different temperature zones. It indicates how the sensitivity of temperature estimates
    varies with the capital proxy used.
  29: Climate impacts lead to a geographic and seasonal re-distribution of energy
    consumption towards tropical regions and towards summer months, as most of the
    increase will be due to higher electricity use for cooling. Commercial and industrial
    activities in temperate and tropical regions, respectively, are two sectors where
    changes in socioeconomic and climatic conditions could significantly expand the
    use of electricity.
  30: Energy demand response to heat and cold is asymmetric and varies geographically,
    across sectors, and fuels. The majority of grid cells in the tropics will experience
    higher energy demand. Temperate regions show varied impacts across sectors and
    fuel. Climate change impacts are regressive, requiring more energy in low- and
    middle-income countries.
  38: Descriptive statistics for several development and energy metrics are provided
    across several temperature and humidity groupings.
  40: Temperature ranges and natural gas use have statistically significant impacts
    on real GDP per capita, with varying effects depending on the region, sector,
    and whether the impact is short-run or long-run. The signs of temperature variables
    vary, suggesting non-linear impacts. The impact of natural gas use is consistently
    negative and statistically significant.
  41: "Significant (p < 0.05) negative relationship between log fuel oil use per capita\
    \ and log real GDP per capita in the long run across all regions and sectors.\
    \ Significant (p < 0.05) positive short-run impact of T < 7.5\xB0C on log real\
    \ GDP per capita in column (4)."
  42: Several statistically significant (p<0.05) relationships are identified between
    humidity/temperature and log real GDP per capita, varying by sector, region, and
    fuel type. The significance and sign of the coefficients change across different
    specifications.
  44: Both high and low humidity, as well as high and low temperatures, have statistically
    significant effects on Log real GDP per capita in both the short and long run,
    although the significance and magnitude of the effects vary across models and
    regions.
  45: "Both temperature extremes (T < 12.5\xB0C and T > 27.5\xB0C) and humidity extremes\
    \ (H < 4 g/kg and H > 14 g/kg) have statistically significant short-run impacts\
    \ on log real GDP per capita."
  47: The analysis highlights the varying sensitivities of different energy sectors
    (agriculture, commercial, industrial, residential, total) to changes in temperature
    under different warming scenarios and regions. There are large changes to total
    sensitivity shown in some cases. The sign of the changes varies with fuel type
    and region.
Methodology:
  1: Econometric analysis of the response of energy demand to temperature and humidity
    exposure combined with future scenarios of climate change and socioeconomic development.
  2: The paper aims to characterize the heterogeneous responsiveness of the demand
    for different fuels to meteorology across regions and sectors, and how these responses
    interact with changing temperature fields.
  3: The authors estimate elasticities of energy demand with respect to temperatures,
    using approaches that involve annual or seasonal averages, accumulated heating
    and cooling degree days, and temporal exposure to different temperature intervals.
    The authors adopt the last approach (temporal exposure) because of its ability
    to capture potential non-linearity in the responses of demand to temperature extremes.
    They also discuss issues with aggregating meteorological data across spatial and
    temporal scales when combining estimates with future climate data.
  4: Econometrically disentangle short- and long-run responses of per-capita energy
    consumption to weather variations. Combine these estimates with ESM temperature
    projections and SSP scenarios. Model global final demand for three energy commodities
    (electricity, fuel oil and natural gas) in four economic sectors (residential,
    commercial, industrial, agriculture).
  5: The response of energy demand to temperature is modeled as a generalized V-shape
    function, with a nadir at the 'balance point' (T0, Q0). The slope of each segment
    represents the marginal effect on demand of additional exposure to heat or cold.
  6: The analysis employs an error correction model to distinguish between short-run
    weather shocks and long-run climate responses. It also utilizes an intertemporal
    optimization model with a quadratic loss function. The model is designed to be
    parsimonious and identify asymmetric demand responses across regions, sectors,
    and fuels from limited data.
  9: A balanced panel dataset of 29-48 countries from 1978-2010 is stratified by climatic
    regime (tropical/temperate). Meteorological data (temperature and humidity) from
    GLDAS is aggregated to daily averages and binned into intervals. Energy consumption
    data is from IEA World Energy Statistics and Balances.
  10: The analysis combines econometrically estimated long-run elasticities with climate
    change scenarios from the CMCC-CM earth system model under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5
    to project impacts on energy demand circa 2050. The 'delta' method is used to
    minimize bias in comparing ESM simulations of current and future climate.
  11: Combines long-run climatic estimates with synthetic historical and future exposure
    series to calculate the change in per capita energy demand at the grid-cell level.
    Aggregates across grid cells, fuels, and sectors to find the net impact on country-level
    final energy demand.
  12: CMCC-CM model is used to simulate changes in temperature exposure for different
    warming scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), with results presented circa 2050.
  13: Projects future energy demand by scaling current demand using income elasticities
    and a 'business as usual' (BaU) scenario based on SSP5.  It accounts for population
    growth and economic expansion to 2050. A climate impact is then incorporated.
  14: Estimation of long-run semi-elasticities of per capita energy final energy consumption
    to daily temperature exposure
  15: Aggregated adjacent bins of temperature data to focus on exposures to hot and
    cold days; Estimated effects of humidity and other covariates
  16: "Uses empirical results in conjunction with SSP5 projections of per capita GDP\
    \ growth to 2050 to calculate future BaU energy consumption based on equations\
    \ 10 and 11. Long-run demand responses to temperature are considered. Error correcting\
    \ speed of adjustment coef\uFB01cient indicates sectors adjust their energy consumption\
    \ to contemporaneous weather shocks at rates of 6-8% per year in the case of electricity,\
    \ 14-32% in the case of gas, and 6-28% in the case of fuel oil."
  17: Projects future energy consumption and intersects it with projected climatic
    changes.
  19: Econometric estimates are stratified by distance from the equator. Projected
    changes in energy demand are calculated using equations (13a)-(13c), based on
    projected fuel and sectoral mix. Analysis is performed at the grid-cell level.
  22: "Point projections constructed at the means of estimated responses to temperature\
    \ and income; Sensitivity analysis at the confidence bounds of parameter estimates,\
    \ assuming independence among fuel\xD7sector combinations, and between the responses\
    \ to temperature and to GDP."
  23: The analysis projects energy demand responses for two different warming scenarios
    (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) circa 2050, compared to a current energy system.
  24: Sensitivity analysis examining energy demand responses in various sectors based
    on temperature and GDP elasticities for different RCP scenarios.
  25: Compares static and first-difference regressions to a dynamic modeling approach
    (error-correcting speed of adjustment) to assess the impact of meteorological
    variation on energy consumption.
  26: "The focus is on residential electricity consumption as it is the fuel\xD7sector\
    \ combination with the largest number of observations."
  27: Long-run equilibrium is estimated using semi-elasticities. The table shows results
    for different proxy variables for capital stock. The applicability depends on
    the data issues discussed in the paper.
  28: The analysis uses different capital proxies (Aggregate capital stock, Heating/cooling
    equip., Machinery/transport equip.) to assess the sensitivity of marginal temperature
    effects. Applicability is dependent on the accuracy of the capital proxies and
    the specific economic relationships considered.
  29: Cross section-time series regressions to estimate short-run and long-run elasticities
    of energy demand with respect to different temperature and humidity intervals,
    controlling for other confounding factors. Long-run elasticities are subsequently
    combined with scenarios of climate change and socio-economic development to project
    the future baseline energy consumptions.
  30: Calculates future percentage and absolute changes (EJ) in energy demand due
    to socio-economic development and changes in climatic conditions globally, for
    different world regions, and at the country-level. Results are projected circa
    2050.
  32: Dynamic panel analysis, econometric analysis of billing data, perpetual inventory
    method
  33: Integrated assessment, panel cointegration analysis, semiparametric estimates.
  38: Descriptive statistics are calculated for countries characterized as 'Dev.Min'
    (presumably developing with minimum development) and 'Temperate' or 'Tropical'
    based on temperature and humidity ranges. The analysis is based on a dataset 'ofthe
    vestatistics', related to (2005 $) per energy (ktoe) per capita GDP.
  40: The analysis uses regression models with first differenced and lagged terms
    to assess short-run and long-run impacts. Robust standard errors are reported.  The
    analysis is performed for the World, Temperate, and Tropical regions, and for
    the Commercial and Residential sectors.
  41: Uses first differenced (short run) and lagged (long run) terms in a regression
    model. Robust standard errors are used. Results are shown for temperate and tropical
    regions and for industry, agriculture, and residential sectors.
  42: Static panel regressions using country-level data for various sectors (residential,
    industry, agriculture, commercial) and regions (temperate, tropical, world) with
    robust standard errors. Different energy sources are used as additional differentiators.
    Significance levels are noted as ** (p<0.05) and * (p<0.1). Number of observations,
    R-squared, and number of countries are reported for each regression.
  44: Uses a regression framework with short-run (first differenced) and long-run
    (lagged) terms. The analysis is performed separately for temperate and tropical
    regions, using different sets of control variables (e.g., machinery and transport
    equipment, heating and cooling equipment, capital stock). Robust standard errors
    are used. The table presents results from 8 different regression specifications.
  45: The analysis appears to use a panel regression model with first difference and
    lagged terms, applied to data from 18 countries with 558 observations. Robust
    standard errors are used.
  47: The analysis appears to use elasticities to model the relationship between temperature,
    GDP, and energy demand. It analyzes the impact of climate change on energy demand
    in 2050.
More Notes:
  1: "Climate-induced changes in energy demand are disproportionally larger in tropical\
    \ regions. South America, Asia, and Africa, increase energy demand across all\
    \ sectors and climate scenarios, while Europe, North America and Oceania exhibit\
    \ mixed responses, but with consistent reductions in the residential sector. Even\
    \ so, only Europe and Oceania in the moderate warming scenario experience aggregate\
    \ reductions in energy use, as commercial electricity use increases signi\uFB01\
    cantly."
  5: The 'balance point' and slopes of the V-shape vary by region and economic sector.
    Non-weather responsive energy consumption (Q0) is highest in the industrial sector
    and lowest in the residential sector. Residential balance point temperatures in
    the tropics exceed those in temperate regions (TRes, Tropical0 > TRes, Temperate0).
    Demand functions are likely asymmetric, with tropical regions' energy consumption
    for cooling being more elastic to high temperatures and heating less elastic to
    low temperatures, and the reverse being true in temperate regions.
  6: The paper aims to provide a simple theoretical framework for understanding the
    relationship between climate change and energy demand across various sectors.
  9: The analysis omits energy use in transportation and not all countries report
    demand for all fuel x sector combinations.
  10: The analysis focuses on temperature as the main climatic driver of changes in
    sectoral demand for different fuels.
  11: The analysis assumes sub-national per capita energy demand is uniformly distributed
    and equal to the national average. The future global energy system is likely to
    differ substantially from the present, especially given population increase and
    economic expansion in the developing world, which is a shortcoming of the analysis.
  12: The analysis focuses on changes in temperature extremes, which can be used to
    infer impacts on various sectors.
  13: "The SSP5 scenario is used for population and GDP projections, assuming conventional\
    \ economic development, slow population growth, rapid productivity growth and\
    \ international convergence of GDP, and rapid increases in \uFB01nal energy consumption."
  14: The table presents results separately for temperate and tropical regions and
    different sectors (agriculture, commercial, industrial, residential) and fuel
    types (electricity, fuel oil, natural gas). There are also reported values of
    Log real GDP per capita elasticity for many of the sector/fuel combinations.
  17: The analysis focuses on the impact of temperature changes on energy demand under
    different climate scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). Absolute increases in hot days
    are concentrated in Southeast Asia, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa.
  19: Impacts are assessed under two warming scenarios (likely RCP 8.5 and a moderate
    warming scenario, though not explicitly stated).
  20: Analysis focuses on the 20 largest economies which are responsible for about
    80% of global energy use; results presented under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
  23: The table focuses exclusively on energy demand changes and doesn't address other
    climate impacts directly. The table distinguishes between impacts on electricity,
    natural gas, and fuel oil demand.
  24: Results emphasize the upper uncertainty bounds due to reliance on a single scenario
    and ESM, suggesting broader uncertainties if multiple scenarios were considered.
  25: The analysis uses real per capita GDP as a proxy for capital stock, which is
    correlated with investment. The residential sector in temperate regions and the
    commercial sector in the tropics are impacted by exposure to hot days. Natural
    gas and fuel oil respond differently to cold days in temperate and tropical regions.
  30: The estimates represent potential changes or adaptation, not accounting for
    barriers to energy access or expansion. Varying energy demand is an important
    form of adaptation for thermal performance.
  38: The table appears to be examining the relationship between development/energy
    consumption metrics and climate variables (temperature and humidity) based on
    country classifications and observations, however the paper is unclear as to its
    ultimate objectives.
  40: The number of observations and R-squared values are provided for each regression
    model. The number of countries included also vary between the model specifications.
  41: R-squared values are relatively low across all models (ranging from 0.044 to
    0.130).
  42: The table presents a robustness check of a static model. The specific functional
    form and econometric specification of the static model are not elaborated upon

    are indicated by asterisks: ** p< 0.05, * p< 0.1.'
  45: The analysis includes log electricity price and log electricity demand per capita
    as control variables. The table presents results from two model specifications
    (1) and (2), which seem to differ by including electricity price in the model.
  47: 'The page presents a table of results, likely from a larger modeling exercise.
    It considers both aggregate and sectoral energy demand changes. The table is continued
    from a previous page (indicated by "Table circa A92050 (Continued): 46").'
Quantitative material:
  1: Globally, future climate change is expected to have a moderate impact on energy
    demand, in the order of 6-11%, depending on the degree of warming.
  4: Long-run semi-elasticities capturing the nonlinear effect of climate on energy
    use; future baseline and climate-induced energy demand.
  6: "The analysis uses parameters such as \u03C1, \u03D61, and \u03D62 in a quadratic\
    \ loss function."
  9: In 2010, weather-sensitive final energy consumption was 108 exajoules (EJ), with
    tropical countries accounting for less than one-fifth. Electricity accounts for
    55% and natural gas 48% of the interfuel distribution.
  10: Table 1 shows global weather-sensitive final energy consumption in 2010 (EJ)
    for agriculture, commercial, industrial, and residential sectors, broken down
    by electricity, natural gas, and fuel oil for Tropical, Temperate, and World regions.
  11: "The index \u03C6Climate can be interpreted as the ratio of per-capita fuel\xD7\
    sector energy consumption in a future climate relative to a base level of consumption\
    \ under the current climate."
  12: "The analysis provides % change in and future exposure to hot and cold days\
    \ under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, circa 2050. Specific changes in the frequency\
    \ of days exceeding 27.5\xB0C and below 12.5\xB0C are visually represented on\
    \ world maps using color gradients, with increases up to 100% for hot days and\
    \ changes ranging from -100% to +100% for cold days."

    Oil), and region (Tropical, Temperate, World).
  17: Ninefold increase in final energy consumed by emerging economies in the tropics
    by mid-century; quadrupling of energy demand in more advanced nations at high
    latitudes by mid-century; developing countries' share of global energy use shifting
    from 20% to 60% by mid-century; In 2050 nearly half of energy consumption is unaffected
    by climate change; small quantities of energy use exposed to a wide range of percentage
    increases in heat (25% to more than 400%).
  18: Quantitative data includes the projected percentage change in residential and
    electricity final energy consumption by 2050 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios,

  19: "More than 70% of the world's projected 7.9 billion people experience changes\
    \ in weather-sensitive energy consumption in excess of \xB15%"
  20: Individuals experiencing a > 25% increase in demand doubles with vigorous warming;
    around 40% of individuals experiencing such large increases live in poor countries;
    changes in agricultural energy consumption are large in percentage changes; industrial
    and residential energy use decline in advanced nations
  21: The page includes quantitative data showing percent changes in energy consumption
    ranging from -40% to 165% for different sectors and regions.
  22: Under both warming scenarios there is a modest increase in global energy consumption,
    by 6% and 11%, respectively; Changes in climate can be expected to increase global
    demand for energy by 55EJ; Potential for small increases or declines to the tune
    of -1.2% to 2.2% (2.5% to 3.8%) of current world energy consumption in the RCP
    4.5 (RCP 8.5) scenario.

    elasticities under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios for the current and 2050 energy
    systems.
  25: First difference estimates substantially understate long-run results compared
    to the dynamic modeling approach. Static estimates sometimes overstate and sometimes
    understate long-run responses.
  26: Long-run semi-elasticities of temperature and humidity impacts on electricity
    consumption are reported, depending on capital stock quantities and their 2010
    values.

    \ to temperature bins with interaction terms are provided for temperate and tropical\
    \ countries, broken down by capital stock type (aggregate, heating/cooling equipment,\
    \ machinery/transport equipment). Example: In temperate countries, a change in\
    \ T > 27.5\xB0C has a semi-elasticity of 0.0014 [0.0006-0.0022] with respect to\
    \ real GDP per capita."

    economic variables under different temperature conditions.
  29: Overall percentage increase in total final energy consumption in tropical regions
    (26%) is greater than the one estimated for temperate countries (0.19%). A 15%
    reduction in residential sector and a 16% increase in the commercial sector in
    temperate regions.
  30: Global energy consumption will increase by 6% and 11% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5,
    respectively, driven by tropical regions (16% and 26%, respectively).
