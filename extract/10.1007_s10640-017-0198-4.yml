Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate-induced changes in energy demand due to temperature and humidity exposure.
  3: Weather variations, especially temperature, precipitation, and humidity. The
    paper focuses on the challenges in integrating climate projections with energy
    demand models due to differences in spatial and temporal scales.
  4: Variations in exposure to hot and cold, dry and humid days; ESM temperature projections;
    scenarios of population and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth; representative
    concentration pathways (RCPs) indicative of a high-warming no-policy scenario
    and moderate-warming mitigation policy scenario; shared socioeconomic pathway
    (SSP) scenario of conventional economic development, slow population growth, international
    convergence, and rapid increases in final energy consumption.
  5: Regional temperature and humidity variations influence energy demand, which could
    have broader economic impacts based on sectoral exposure to weather.
  6: Increasing summer temperatures are a driver, potentially leading to amplified
    electricity demand.
  7: Exposure to intervals of temperature (ET) and humidity (EH).
  8: Temperature (T) and Humidity (H)
  10: Climate change, specifically changes in temperature, are the main climatic driver
    considered. Socio-economic development is also a factor.
  11: "Changes in frequency of hot days (mean temperature > 27.5\xB0C) and cold days\
    \ (mean temperature < 0\xB0C)."
  13: Fine spatial scale climatic shocks applied to future fuel x sector levels of
    per-capita demand.
  14: "Changes in temperature, specifically the number of days with T < 12.5\xB0C\
    \ (heating) and T > 27.5\xB0C (cooling)."
  15: Exposure to temperature changes affects energy demand for heating and cooling,
    with different fuel dependencies by region.
  16: Long-run demand responses to temperature, with sectors adjusting their energy
    consumption to weather shocks.
  17: Changes in the frequency of cold days and hot days due to climate change
  18: Climate change as represented by RCP4.5 (moderate emissions) and RCP8.5 (high
    emissions) scenarios.
  19: Distance from the equator is a key determinant of the direction of climate change
    impact on future energy consumption.

  22: Changes in climate and socio-economic conditions impacting energy consumption.
  23: Climate change impacts modeled via Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)

    Industrial, Residential) and fuel types (Electricity, Natural Gas, Fuel Oil).
  24: Uncertainties in energy consumption's responses to income (GDP elasticity) and
    meteorology (temperature elasticities) under different Representative Concentration
    Pathways (RCP) for radiative forcing.
  25: Exposure to hot days, exposure to cold days.
  26: Temperature and humidity are drivers of risk.
  27: "The drivers of risk are temperature changes, notably exposure to > 27.5\xB0\
    C days, which influence energy demand and potentially impact GDP per capita."
  28: "Temperature (specifically categorized as Tropical (T>27.5\xB0C), Temperate\
    \ (T>27.5\xB0C), and Temperate (T<12.5\xB0C))"
  29: Climate change (temperature and humidity intervals), socioeconomic development,
    sectoral heterogeneity.
  31: Changes in geographically and temporally varying temperature data.
  38: Temperature (T) and Humidity (H) categories, Population, Total Electricity,
    Natural Gas, Fuel oil, and Energy consumption (ktoe) in Agriculture, Commercial,
    Residential and Industrial sectors.
  39: "Humidity (H < 4 g/kg, H > 14 g/kg), Temperature (T < 12.5\xB0C, T > 27.5\xB0\
    C)"
  40: "Temperature bands (T < 7.5\xB0C, 7.5 < T < 10\xB0C, 10 < T < 12.5\xB0C, 12.5\
    \ < T < 15\xB0C, 15 < T < 17.5\xB0C), Log natural gas use per capita"
  41: "Temperature (T) below certain thresholds (7.5\xB0C, 10-12.5\xB0C) and log fuel\
    \ oil use per capita are drivers of risk/impact on GDP."
  42: Temperature and humidity levels are considered as shocks impacting macroeconomic
    outcomes.
  43: "Temperature variations (e.g., T <12.5\xB0C, T >27.5\xB0C) and humidity levels\
    \ (e.g., H <4 g/kg, H >14 g/kg) are considered as drivers impacting GDP per capita."

    outputs.
  47: Warming scenarios, total temperature, sectoral analysis; RCP Gas scenarios
Highlights:
  1: Regressive impact on energy demand, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income
    countries.
  3: The paper highlights the importance of considering non-linear responses of energy
    demand to temperature extremes and the challenges of downscaling climate projections
    to match the resolution of energy consumption data. Understating weather extremes
    due to averaging can underestimate impacts.
  4: Development of a flexible methodology to characterize geographic variations in
    climate change impacts on energy demand across the globe.
  5: Energy demand exhibits a V-shape response to temperature changes, with elasticity
    varying between tropical and temperate regions, affecting cooling and heating
    demands differently.
  6: The paper emphasizes the importance of considering both intensive and extensive
    margin adjustments in energy consumption.
  7: The paper models energy demand as a function of exposure to temperature and humidity,
    incorporating the role of space conditioning equipment and other factors.
  11: The majority of grid cells will experience increased frequency of hot days and
    decreased frequency of cold days, though geographic incidence is uneven. This
    will affect energy demand, with increased cooling needs and decreased heating
    needs. The approach to assessing energy demand impacts needs to account for the
    differences in the future global energy system compared to the present, given
    population increases and economic expansion.
  14: The impact of temperature changes on log real GDP per capita varies significantly
    across sectors and regions. For example, industrial fuel oil consumption in temperate
    regions has a -1.32 [-2.3, -0.34] elasticity.
  15: Fuel and sector response to temperature is asymmetric; heating or cooling demands
    are mostly significant and positive.
  16: The 2050 fuel mix is projected to be more skewed toward electricity (68%).
  17: Energy consumption in developing countries is expected to increase significantly,
    particularly in tropical regions. Areas with already high temperatures and small
    energy use will experience the greatest increases in heat exposure. Baseline energy
    consumption decreases as the percentage of hot days increases.
  18: Significant regional variations in projected energy demand changes, with increases
    in some regions (e.g., Africa, Middle East, South Asia) and decreases in others
    (e.g., parts of North America, Europe).
  19: The projected impacts of energy demand are regressive, affecting predominantly
    low- and middle-income countries.
  20: Impacts on aggregate energy consumption are mostly negative in advanced countries,
    and mostly positive in developing nations; South America, Asia and Africa see
    ubiquitous increases, while Europe, North America and Oceania exhibit mixed responses
    but with consistent reductions in the residential sector.
  22: Increases in global energy consumption driven largely by tropical countries;
    sensitivity analysis shows small potential variations in energy demand around
    2050.
  23: Climate change is projected to have varying impacts on energy demand across
    sectors and regions. Under RCP 8.5 circa 2050, total energy demand in the world
    increases significantly (55.12 EJ) compared to smaller changes or decreases under
    RCP 4.5 (-0.26 EJ). The residential and commercial sectors could see significant
    reductions in energy demand under both RCP scenarios and current systems. The
    table presents sector and regional breakdowns for each RCP for both current and
    2050 energy demands.
  24: Uncertainty in responses is not additive, and generates increases of 4.7-8.9%
    under moderate warming (RCP4.5), and 7.5-19.3% under rapid warming (RCP8.5) when
    temperature and GDP response uncertainties are combined. The upper bounds in Table
    5.D may well understate the true uncertainty because projections of temperature
    change rely on a single scenario of economic growth, and projections of future
    temperature change from a single Earth System Model (ESM).
  25: Energy consumption responses are asymmetric, with hot days increasing electricity
    consumption more in residential sectors in temperate regions and commercial sectors
    in the tropics. Natural gas residential consumption responds to cold days in temperate
    regions, while fuel oil residential consumption responds to cold days in both
    temperate and tropical regions. The dynamic modeling approach makes a difference
    to the elasticities used to project changes in energy consumption.
  26: The marginal effect of temperature and humidity depends on the capital stock
    quantity, with the heterogeneity in marginal responses being small and centered
    around estimates from the main model. Including energy prices reduces the speed
    of adjustment.
  27: "Increases in temperature days (> 27.5\xB0C) lead to a 13% increase in the long-run\
    \ effect on energy consumption in temperate countries, indicating adaptation impacts."
  28: The sensitivity of Real GDP per capita to temperature varies across temperature
    zones. The 'Real GDP per capita' (red dots) generally appears to be towards the
    left for 'Tropical' and lower 'Temperate' categories, but shifts more to the right
    in the higher temperature 'Temperate' category.
  29: Climate change leads to a geographic and seasonal redistribution of energy consumption
    towards tropical regions and summer months due to higher electricity use for cooling.
    The analysis highlights sectoral heterogeneity, particularly the differing impacts
    on residential and commercial sectors in temperate regions.
  31: The paper focuses on heterogeneity in demand response across sectors, fuels,
    and regions, and the interaction of these responses with temperature data, which
    are identified as missing elements in the impact literature.
  38: Descriptive statistics of real GDP and relevant parameters were extracted. The
    statistics were organized by region (Temperate, Tropical, Dev.Min countries).
  39: Significant short-run and long-run effects of humidity and temperature on log
    real GDP per capita, varying by region and sector. Lagged electricity use and
    real GDP also significantly affect real GDP per capita.
  40: Temperature changes and natural gas consumption significantly impact log real
    GDP per capita, with varying effects depending on temperature band and region;
    both short-run and long-run impacts are estimated.
  41: "Log fuel oil use per capita has a statistically significant and negative relationship\
    \ with log real GDP per capita in the long run across all models. Temperature\
    \ below 7.5\xB0C has a statistically significant and positive relationship with\
    \ log real GDP per capita, both in the short and long run, in some models."
  42: Temperature and humidity have significant effects on GDP per capita across different
    sectors and regions.
  43: Key findings include significant effects of low and high temperatures on GDP
    per capita in various sectors and climatic regions.
  44: Extreme temperatures (both low and high) and humidity levels have statistically
    significant impacts on Log real GDP per capita, as seen from the coefficients
    and significance levels in the table.
  45: Short-run increases in humidity (both low and high) and temperature (both low
    and high) are associated with statistically significant increases in log real
    GDP per capita. Long run increases in high temperature are associated with statistically
    significant increases in log real GDP per capita.
  47: The table presents sensitivity ranges for various economic and energy demand
    outcomes to changes in GDP, broken down by sector, region and warming scenario.
Methodology:
  1: Econometric analysis of energy demand response to temperature and humidity, combined
    with future climate and socioeconomic scenarios.
  3: The paper discusses different approaches to estimating elasticities of energy
    demand with respect to temperature, including annual or seasonal averages, heating
    and cooling degree days, and temporal exposure to different temperature intervals.
    It advocates for the last approach to capture non-linearity in the responses of
    demand to temperature extremes. It also discusses the importance of aggregating
    current and future meteorological data consistently across spatial and temporal
    scales when constructing impact projections.
  4: Econometrically disentangling the short- and long-run responses of per-capita
    energy consumption to variations in exposure to hot and cold, dry and humid days;

  5: The analysis focuses on the response of energy demand to temperature, using empirical
    models adapted to regional differences in climate and sectoral weather exposure.
  6: The framework involves an intertemporally optimizing agent achieving a target
    equilibrium level of thermal performance.
  7: "The analysis uses an error-correcting model of energy demand (Eq. 4) based on\
    \ a partial adjustment model. The dependent variable is the logarithm of fuel\
    \ \xD7sector \xD7country \xD7year demand for final energy per person."
  8: Cross section-time series error-correction model to estimate the impact of temperature
    and humidity exposure on energy demand.
  11: Uses long-run climatic estimates combined with synthetic historical and future
    exposure series to calculate the change in per capita energy demand at the grid-cell
    level. Aggregates across grid cells, fuels, and sectors to determine the net impact
    on country-level final energy demand. Assumes that sub-national per capita energy
    demand is uniformly distributed and equal to the national average.

    sectoral mix.
  22: Analysis involves point projections with sensitivity analysis on parameter estimates
    considering mean, lower, and upper bounds of responses to temperature and GDP
    changes.
  23: The analysis models energy demand responses under different warming scenarios
    (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for current and future (circa 2050) energy systems.
  24: Sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the impact of uncertainty in temperature
    and GDP elasticities on sectoral and aggregate energy demand. The analysis focuses
    on the year 2050. It uses different RCP scenarios and compares a 'current energy
    system' to a '2050 energy system'. It assesses how varying the temperature response
    at mean income elasticities and varying the income elasticities at mean temperature
    elasticities affect energy demand.
  25: Econometric models, static regressions, first-difference regressions, dynamic
    modeling approach. Uses real per capita GDP as a proxy for capital stock. Compares
    different econometric approaches (static, first-difference, dynamic).
  26: The analysis uses a regression model (equation 16) with interaction terms to
    explore how weather-exposed capital stocks (proxied by per capita GDP, aggregate
    capital stocks, and accumulated real imports of heating/cooling equipment and
    machinery/transport equipment) affect the relationship between temperature/humidity
    and residential electricity consumption. The analysis examines the impact of including
    energy prices.
  27: The analysis employs estimated semi-elasticities with confidence intervals to
    assess the impact of temperature on energy demand, with considerations for adaptation
    mechanisms.
  28: The analysis uses different capital proxies to estimate the marginal effect
    of temperature. The results appear to be categorized by temperature zones (Tropical
    and Temperate).
  29: Cross-section time series regressions to estimate short-run and long-run elasticities
    of energy demand with respect to different temperature and humidity intervals,
    controlling for other confounding factors. Long-run elasticities are combined
    with scenarios of climate change and socio-economic development to project future
    baseline energy consumptions.
  31: The paper establishes a methodology to model heterogeneity in demand response
    across sectors, fuels, and regions, and how these responses interact with temperature
    data. Future climate impacts are illustrated using one specific Earth System Model
    (ESM) and socioeconomic scenario.

More Notes:
  3: The paper emphasizes the need for empirical modeling that anticipates the challenges
    in projecting climate change impacts on energy demand.
  4: The paper models the global final demand for three energy commodities (electricity,
    fuel oil, and natural gas) in four economic sectors (residential, commercial,
    industrial, agriculture).
  7: The model uses first differences for changes in temperature, humidity, and other
    variables. Specific humidity is used because it is less correlated with temperature.
  8: "The model uses a fixed effect to capture the influence of unobserved time-invariant\
    \ country-specific factors on the average growth rate of energy demand. The model\
    \ partitions the influence of covariates into short and long-run effects. Long-run\
    \ demand response is computed as the cumulative disequilibrium demand response\
    \ throughout the adjustment period, which is given by -\u03B3/\u03B8. Coefficient\
    \ estimates are semi-elasticities."
  11: The paper uses grid-cell level data and scales up to the national level to determine
    effects.
  13: The analysis focuses on energy demand as a key variable affected by both economic
    growth and climate change, which could subsequently impact broader macroeconomic
    and fiscal outcomes. The model aggregates climate change impacts at a fine spatial
    scale to country level.
  14: The analysis focuses on the impact of temperature on energy demand and, in turn,
    the elasticity of GDP with regards to that change in demand. It distinguishes
    between temperate and tropical regions.
  15: Residential and commercial cooling demand is mostly met by electricity, while
    heating demands in temperate and tropical regions vary by fuel type.
  17: The analysis focuses on the energy sector and does not directly quantify macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes such as GDP effects or government budget balances. The presented
    data focuses on the change in energy demand, which in turn, influences other fiscal
    and macroeconomic variables.
  18: The analysis focuses on the energy sector impacts of climate change, providing
    spatially disaggregated projections of changes in final energy demand under different
    warming scenarios.
  22: Findings emphasize the secondary importance of climate change impacts compared
    to economic expansion on global energy demand.
  23: The table focuses solely on energy demand. It does not explicitly address macroeconomic
    outcomes like GDP effects or fiscal outcomes like budget balance. It does not
    show any adaptation measures.
  24: The analysis highlights the 'long upper tail of impacts' arising from uncertainties
    in energy consumption responses to income and meteorology. The paper acknowledges
    that incorporating additional GDP forecasts and multiple spatial fields of temperature
    change projected by additional ESMs would likely broaden the uncertainty range.
  25: The error-correcting speed of adjustment is fairly large.
  27: The impacts are considered to be a lower bound in temperate countries due to
    adaptation; in tropical countries, market development might mitigate long-run
    impacts.
  28: The horizontal axis is not labelled with units. The error bars provide a measure
    of variability in the estimates.
  29: The paper develops a flexible methodology to characterize geographic variations,
    sectoral, and fuel heterogeneity in climate change impacts on global energy demand,
    taking into account how vulnerable human and energy systems will change.
  31: The methodology relies on a uniform distribution of per capita energy demand
    at the grid-cell level, derived from national averages. It indirectly models the
    energy demand from changes in energy-using durable goods. The paper acknowledges
    limitations, including using only one ESM and socioeconomic scenario and not explicitly
    associating changes in energy consumption to specific end-use services.
  38: The table appears to present descriptive statistics of a dataset (A1) used in
    an analysis, potentially a panel dataset, with observations across countries and
    time. Units for Energy variables is (ktoe) (2005$)
  39: The dependent variable is 'Electricity' and it is probably an elasticity regression
    using ordinary least squares.
  40: 'The analysis is performed at a national level using panel data. Significance
    levels are indicated: ** (p<0.05) and * (p<0.1).'
  41: The table examines the impact of temperature and fuel oil use on GDP, differentiating
    between short-run and long-run effects. The significance levels vary, suggesting
    some sensitivity to model specification. The R-squared values are generally low,
    indicating that the models explain a limited amount of the variance in GDP.
  44: The analysis distinguishes between temperate and tropical regions, and different
    types of capital (machinery and transport equipment, heating and cooling equipment,
    and capital stock).
  45: The inclusion of residential electricity prices slightly alters the results
    but the general pattern remains consistent. The model includes both short-run
    (first difference) and long-run (lagged) effects. The model also controls for
    log electricity demand per capita.
  47: The data is presented in ranges, likely representing uncertainty in the models
    or parameters used. The term 'circa' suggests that the results pertain to approximately
    the year 2050.

    by 55 EJ.
  23: Presents quantitative estimates of changes in energy demand in EJ, broken down
    by sector, fuel type, region (Tropical, Temperate, World), and climate scenario
    (RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5) for 'Current energy system' and 'Energy system circa 2050'.
  24: Table 5 presents quantitative ranges for changes in energy demand (EJ) under
    different scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) and sensitivity analyses. Ranges are
    provided for Agriculture, Commercial, Industrial, Residential, and Total energy
    demand.
  25: Mentions tables in the appendix (A6, A5, A2, A3, A4) and Table 2 contain quantitative
    estimates. First-difference estimates understate long-run results, static estimates
    sometimes overstate and sometimes understate long-run responses. Income elasticities
    of fuel oil demand are positive.
  26: Long-run semi-elasticities are reported in Table 6, full regression results
    in Table A7, and robustness tests of residential electricity semi-elasticities
    to the inclusion of household energy prices are in Table A8.
  27: Semi-elasticities of energy demand to temperature changes are provided for both
    temperate and tropical countries, indicating changes in GDP per capita and capital
    stock.
  28: The plot shows the sensitivity of the marginal effect of temperature on Real
    GDP per capita, Aggregate capital stock, Heating/cooling equip., and Machinery/transport
    equip.
  29: Global demand for air conditioning could expand by a factor of 20 in 2050, even
    assuming a constant climate. Overall percentage increase in total final energy
    consumption in tropical regions (26%) is greater than temperate countries (0.19%).
    Temperate regions can see a 15% reduction in residential energy consumption and
    a 16% increase in the commercial sector.
  31: The paper uses global statistics on energy demand by sector, which are not provided
    on this page.
  38: "Provides descriptive statistics (Mean, Standard Deviation, Max, Observations)\
    \ for Real GDP\uFB01nal and the other drivers of risk broken down by climate zone\
    \ (Temperate, Tropical, Dev.Min countries). Provides Mean and Standard Deviation\
    \ for these countries."
  39: Regression coefficients and standard errors for short-run (first differenced)
    and long-run (lagged) terms of log real GDP per capita, humidity, and temperature.
  40: Regression coefficients and standard errors for the impact of temperature bands
    and natural gas use on log real GDP per capita, R-squared values, number of observations,
    and number of countries.
  41: The table presents regression coefficients, standard errors, R-squared values,
    and the number of observations and countries included in each regression. Statistically
    significant coefficients are marked with * or **.
  42: Coefficients and statistical significance levels for various models showing
    the impact of temperature and humidity on log real GDP per capita.
  43: Coefficients and R-squared values are provided for models assessing the impact
    of temperature and humidity on log real GDP per capita across sectors and regions.
  44: "The table presents regression coefficients showing the impact of temperature\
    \ and humidity variables, along with other variables, on Log real GDP per capita.\
    \ The coefficients show both short-run (first differenced) and long-run (lagged)\
    \ effects. For example, a short-run increase in T > 27.5\u25E6C has a statistically\
    \ significant positive impact on Log real GDP per capita in several models."
  45: Coefficients and standard errors for the impact of electricity price, humidity,
    and temperature on log real GDP per capita are reported in both the short run
    (first difference) and long run (lagged).
  46: Ranges of values are provided for various fuel types and sectors under different
    scenarios, indicating potential changes in parameters such as elasticity and energy
    demand.
  47: Quantitative ranges of impacts on GDP, energy demand (Oil, Fuel, Natural Gas,
    Electricity) across different regions (Tropical, Temperate, World) and sectors
    (Agriculture, Commercial, Industrial, Residential) under different warming scenarios
    (RCP) are provided.
