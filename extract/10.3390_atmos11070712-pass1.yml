Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change leading to more frequent heat waves (HWs).
  12: Increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves (HWs) driven by climate change,
    specifically under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
  14: Increased heat wave frequency, duration, and intensity due to climate change
    (specifically under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios).
Highlights:
  1: The north-western part of South Africa is expected to have the most drastic increase
    in HWs occurrences across the country. Whilst the central interior is not projected
    to experience pronounced increases in HW frequency, HWs across this region are
    expected to last longer under future climate change.
  12: Heatwaves are projected to increase in frequency and duration across South Africa.
    Regions in the central interior are expected to experience HWs lasting for over
    a week during SON and DJF. HWs will be more intense across the north-western part
    of South Africa during DJF. Winter HWs are expected to last 3-4 days.
  14: Southern Africa is projected to experience increased heatwave frequency, duration,
    and intensity, especially under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Heatwave intensity increases
    are projected to be more significant during the MAM (March-April-May) season.
Methodology:
  1: "An ensemble of regional climate model downscalings obtained from the Conformal\
    \ Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) for the periods 2010\u20132039, 2040\u20132069,\
    \ and 2070\u20132099, with 1983\u20132012 as the historical baseline. Simulations\
    \ were performed under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 (moderate\
    \ greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration) and 8.5 (high GHG concentration) greenhouse\
    \ gas emission scenarios."
  12: Simulations projecting HW frequency and intensity for South Africa for the periods
    2010-2039, 2040-2069, and 2070-2099 under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Baseline
    period for comparison is 1983-2012.
  14: Climate model simulations projecting heatwave frequency, duration, and intensity
    under different RCP scenarios for the period 2070-2099.
More Notes:
  12: The moderating effect of adjacent oceans is mentioned as a factor influencing
    the duration of winter heatwaves.
  14: The page focuses on characterizing climate risks, specifically heatwaves, without
    directly quantifying macroeconomic or fiscal impacts. It provides a regional specific
    scenario (Southern Africa), potentially of interest for national analyses within
    that region.

Quantitative material:
  12: "HW intensity increase of about 6\xB0C/30-year period over the Highveld of Mpumalanga\
    \ and KwaZulu-Natal under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 in winter (90th percentile). Seasonal\
    \ average HW temperature ranging from 41 to 44\xB0C in the north-western part\
    \ of South Africa during DJF."
