Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on forest productivity
  2: Climate change leading to altered forest productivity (potential increases in
    the near future).
  7: Climate change is the main driver of risk, impacting forest productivity through
    changes in environmental factors and nutrient influences on carbon fixation, allocation,
    and decomposition.
  9: Climate change (specifically, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations).
  10: Climate change impacts, specifically temperature and precipitation changes,
    affect forest productivity.
  11: Climate change and elevated carbon dioxide
  13: Changes imposed on ATLAS growth and yield functions due to climate change (implied).
  14: Forest type, timber assessment year (1993 vs 2005)
  16: Changes in NPP (Net Primary Productivity) and vegetation biomass are used as
    drivers affecting timber assessment.
  18: Climate change, specifically changes in temperature and precipitation.
  20: Projected climate and carbon dioxide change impacting forest growth and inventory.
  21: It discusses climate change and carbon dioxide scenarios as drivers impacting
    forest productivity and market changes.
  22: Climate-induced changes in production lead to shifts between agriculture and
    forestry land use.
  25: Climate change impacts through dieback and regeneration pathways.
  26: Climate change impacts on forest productivity, forest products consumption,
    prices, and trade; infrastructure constraints on timber supply
  27: Climate change impacts on net primary productivity (NPP) in forests, affecting
    timber supply and prices.
  28: Climate change scenarios (low, midrange, high emission) affecting vegetation
    carbon dynamics; Uncertainty in economic models

    products.
  34: Climate change and related price shifts, urbanization.
  36: Climate change influence on forest growth, sudden changes in inventory (dieback)
Highlights:
  1: Integrating ecological dynamics with economics is important in assessing the
    effects of climate change on forests.
  2: The forest sector is remarkably adaptable in the face of potential climate changes;
    Climate change is likely to alter forest productivity with potential increases
    in the near future.
  10: The productivity response to climate change projections is smaller (8-27%) compared
    to economic opportunities from timber management (25-39%).
  11: Net primary production response to climate change varies significantly based
    on the climate scenario and biogeochemical model used.  Elevated carbon dioxide
    is considered as a factor.
  13: The table highlights the range of potential changes in timber growth rates due
    to changes in the ATLAS model between assessments, providing insight into the
    sensitivity of timber growth to model changes and, potentially, climate change
    impacts.
  14: The table presents changes ('delta') in timber assessments between 1993 and
    2005 for various forest types across different regions of the US.
  16: Timber assessment values are changing in either direction from the 1993 assessment
    to the 2005 assessment. The differences from the 2005 assessment sometimes feature
    a wide range in values.
  18: Climate change impacts forest productivity and the forest sector; early models
    assumed linear changes in forest productivity over time under climate change,
    but the 2005 RPA Timber Assessment uses transient climate scenarios.
  20: Climate and carbon dioxide change lead to greater forest growth and inventory
    increases than climate change alone. Regional stumpage prices are more sensitive
    than national product markets, but impacts on product markets are muted by interregional
    and international substitution.
  21: The page highlights the use of intertemporal optimization models to explore
    climate change impacts on the forest sector.
  22: Timber and wood product markets are likely to adjust and adapt to climate change,
    benefiting consumers.
  25: The study provides estimates of how climate change, specifically dieback and
    regeneration processes, can impact the timber market by changing the net present
    value of the market surplus.
  26: Steady-state responses overstate the welfare effect compared to dynamic model
    computations; The forest sector is adaptive to climate changes.
  27: Expanding NPP of the world's forests generally hurts timber-producing regions
    and benefits consumers; overall net economic impact is positive.
  28: Higher growth leads to larger timber growing stock that lowers log prices, increases
    consumption, and improves total economic welfare globally under all scenarios.
    Regional results vary considerably among themselves and with the global results.
  29: Trade in forest products plays an important role in determining whether a region
    realizes any gains associated with climate change. Globally, economic welfare
    increases despite different economic gains and losses across world regions.
  30: All prices are predicted to be lower with higher timber harvests under climate
    change; net market surplus is expected to increase 3-6.7%; North American and
    the former Soviet Union see welfare losses; gains in forest productivity in the
    former Soviet Union are particularly large.
  36: Importance of temporal dynamics of climate change, influence of trade at the
    global scale, regional response, integrated ecological and economic evaluation
Methodology:
  1: The RPA Timber Assessment model was the first national timber assessment model
    to include climate change scenarios impacting forest productivity and the forest
    sector. Climate change impact on ecosystem productivity was analyzed exogenously
    under various climate change scenarios and linked to the forest sector modeling
    system.
  2: Analytical tools are used to quantify impacts of climate change on forest productivity,
    forest diversity, and the supply and demand for wood products; Analysis through
    the RPA (Renewable Resources Assessment).
  7: The Assessment System modeling framework was modified to incorporate information
    from climate models and biogeochemical models (specifically the Terrestrial Ecosystem
    Model - TEM) to modify growth coefficients within ATLAS. This allowed for assessing
    the impact of climate change on the forest sector. The information flow between
    climate models and ecological models consisted of 'deltas' representing relative
    changes in climatic factors.
  9: Climate scenarios from four general circulation models (GCMs) were used to examine
    the impact of climate change on forest productivity. Ecosystem dynamics were modeled
    within 0.5 degree longitude by 0.5 degree latitude grid cells.
  10: Climate models are run for current and future climate scenarios with varying
    carbon dioxide levels to project ecosystem productivity using the Terrestrial
    Ecosystem Model (TEM).
  11: The analysis uses biogeochemical models (TEM, Century, BBGC) to simulate the
    impact of different climate change scenarios on net primary production (NPP) and
    timberland growth. The results are specific to the conterminous US.
  13: Compares ATLAS growth and yield functions from the 1993 and 2005 RPA Timber
    Assessments, likely using simulation modeling.
  14: Comparison of 1993 and 2005 RPA Timber Assessment analyses for various regions
    and forest types in the US Pacific Southwest, Rocky Mountain North, Rocky Mountain
    South, and North Central areas.
  16: The 1993 RPA Timber Assessment changes were developed using changes in NPP over
    the period 1991-2065. The 2005 Timber Assessment changes used changes in vegetation
    biomass over the same period. The specific method for linking NPP and biomass
    changes to timber assessment isn't detailed.
  18: Ecological models (TEM) and economic models (RPA Timber Assessment) are used
    to project the impacts of climate change on forest productivity and the forest
    sector; the 2005 RPA Timber Assessment uses transient climate scenarios to explore
    these impacts.
  20: TEM-Timber Assessment Projection System analyses
  21: Forest sector models with intertemporal optimization, specifically the FASOM
    model, provide 100-year projections of forest sector production, prices, and welfare.
  22: Analysis examines land-use shifts and economic adjustments between agriculture
    and forestry under various climate scenarios.
  25: The net present value is measured with a discount rate of 5%. The analysis considers
    different biogeographical and biogeochemistry models coupled with climate models
    (UKMO and OSU) to estimate changes in timber market surplus under climate change
    scenarios.
  26: Uses TEM model to simulate productivity changes for 18 vegetation types at 0.5
    degree latitude by 0.5 degree longitude under four climate scenarios; University
    of Washington CGTM computes market equilibria for regional forest product sectors
    considering constraints on processing capacity and available wood resources. Two
    economic scenarios (intensive and extensive margin) are explored.
  27: Analysis uses four unspecified Global Climate Models (GCMs) and two economic
    scenarios to assess the impact of climate change on the forest sector; results
    are applicable to the conditions and models used in Perez-Garcia et al. (1997).
  28: The CGTM (Computable General Trade Model) was used to analyze the impacts of
    climate change on the global forest sector using three transient climate change
    scenarios from the integrated global system model (IGSM) for the period 1990-2100.
    TEM (Terrestrial Ecosystem Model) simulated vegetation carbon dynamics annually.
  29: A global economic model is used to simulate the impact of climate change on
    forest product markets, considering different climate scenarios and the effects
    of trade. Analysis considers both softwood and hardwood changes.
  30: A forest sector model using intertemporal optimization incorporating 46 different
    ecosystem and management types; BIOME3 ecological model used to generate steady-state
    results, converted to transient scenarios; Ecosystem pathways of dieback and regeneration
    developed following Sohngen and Mendelsohn (1998).
  34: FASOM (Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model) analyses are used
    to incorporate land-use change between agriculture and forestry.
  36: Uses state-of-the-art ecological models to describe climate change influence
    on forest growth and sudden changes in inventory, bioeconomic analyses, perfect
    foresight models, timber supply models
More Notes:
  11: The climate scenarios (GISS, GFDL-1, GFDL-Q, OSU, UKMO) are further described
    in Melillo et al. (1993) or VEMAP (1995).
  13: The data is specific to timber assessments conducted in 1993 and 2005, limiting
    its applicability to current conditions and potentially requiring recalibration
    with more recent data and models. The table only shows the changes to ATLAS model
    and does not explicitly model climate change scenarios.
  14: The 'delta' values seem to represent changes in timber volume or value, but
    the precise meaning of 'delta' and the units are not explicitly defined on this
    page. The table presents point estimates (mean delta) and confidence intervals,
    suggesting a statistical analysis was conducted.
  16: The table presents projections/changes in timber assessment and does not directly
    estimate the macroeconomic or macro-fiscal impacts, or costs and benefits of adaptation
    strategies. The link between timber assessment and broader economic/fiscal outcomes
    is not explicitly established in the provided text, so any macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    inferences are speculative.
  18: The page focuses on the methodology used to assess the impact of climate change
    on the forest sector, rather than providing quantitative estimates of macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes.
  20: The analysis focuses on the forestry sector, specifically softwood and hardwood
    inventories, timber harvest, and prices.
  21: The FASOM model is detailed as providing projections without specific links
    to macroeconomic outcomes such as GDP or fiscal impacts.
  25: The results are presented in 1982 US dollars.
  26: The analysis divides the globe into 43 log-producing regions and 33 product-consuming
    regions, simulating over 400 trade flows.
  27: Trade tends to dampen the effects of climate change on forest product markets.
  28: Uncertainty in economic models appears to be at least as great as the uncertainty
    in the GCMs.
  29: The welfare changes are broken down into intensive and extensive margins, offering
    insights into the sources of welfare changes.
  30: Future price expectations optimally adjust timber investments and rotation age
    in the dynamic optimization models.
  34: The paper primarily focuses on impacts on forest sector models, potentially
    overlooking impacts on other sectors or indirect impacts on forestry from other
    sectors.
  36: Ecological results overstate the impact of climate change on the forest sector
    if taken in isolation
