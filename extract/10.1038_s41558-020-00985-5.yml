Drivers of Risk:
  1: Day-to-day temperature variability, measured as the intra-monthly standard deviation
    of daily temperature, is identified as a driver of risk, independent of and in
    addition to changes in annual average temperature.
  2: Day-to-day temperature variability
  4: "Day-to-day temperature variability; degree days above 30\xB0C and 25\xB0C; seasonal\
    \ temperature differences"
  5: The driver of risk is day-to-day temperature variability.
  6: Day-to-day temperature variability
  8: Day-to-day temperature variability, annual average temperature, annual average
    temperature change, and yearly total precipitation.
  9: Day-to-day temperature variability is impacting economic growth.
  10: Day-to-day temperature variability.

  12: Regional growth rates
Highlights:
  1: Increases in seasonally adjusted day-to-day temperature variability reduce macro-economic
    growth.
  2: Day-to-day temperature variability has a negative linear effect on regional growth
    rates. The magnitude of the response is modulated by the seasonal temperature
    difference, with countries experiencing smaller seasonal temperature differences
    affected more. The effect of day-to-day temperature variability is independent
    of changes in annual average temperature.
  4: The reduction in regional growth rates per extra degree of day-to-day temperature
    variability is larger in countries with lower GDP per capita. The effect of day-to-day
    temperature variability is approximately equal across the agricultural, manufacturing,
    and services sectors. Day-to-day temperature variability in spring, summer and
    autumn has significant effects of similar magnitudes on annual regional growth
    rates. Day-to-day variability in winter on annual regional growth rates is statistically
    insignificant.
  5: Lower-income regions are more vulnerable to increases in day-to-day temperature
    variability due to their low income and lack of resilience. Higher income enables
    regions to better utilize exposure to large historical seasonal temperature differences
    to adapt to greater day-to-day variability. The negative impacts of day-to-day
    variability on economic growth persist for at least two years.
  6: "Day-to-day temperature variability on macroeconomic growth constitutes a previously\
    \ unidentified impact channel of considerable magnitude in the climate\u2013economy\
    \ relationship."
  10: Regions which are accustomed to smaller seasonal temperature differences suffer
    greater marginal losses (greater negative marginal changes) from a 1 degree increase
    of day-to-day temperature variability.
  11: No relevant information
  12: Difference between the response of high- and low-income regions is not significant,
    although above-median income regions generally experience smaller marginal losses.
Methodology:
  1: Fixed-effects panel models are used to analyze observed day-to-day temperature
    variability with subnational economic data for 1,537 regions worldwide over 40
    years.
  2: Fixed-effects panel regression models to exploit within-region changes of day-to-day
    temperature variability and regional growth from one year to the next, using ERA5
    climate data (1979-2018) and a regional economic dataset. Analysis is done at
    the regional level.
  4: Regression models are used to estimate the reduction in regional growth rates
    per extra degree of day-to-day temperature variability. Sectoral detail of economic
    dataset is used. Different climate re-analysis datasets were used for robustness.
  5: The analysis uses CAN (Climate-economy) data, partitioning it by median national
    income to evaluate marginal losses from temperature variability. A distributed-lag
    model is used to assess the persistence of the effects. The analysis covers the
    period 1979-2018.
  6: Econometric specification
  8: Fixed-effects panel regression models are applied to estimate the effect of annual
    day-to-day temperature variability on economic growth, controlling for regional
    and yearly fixed effects, seasonal temperature differences, nonlinear effects
    of annual average temperature, annual average temperature change, and yearly total
    precipitation. Climate data from ERA5, WFDEI, and EWEMBI reanalysis datasets are
    used for the period 1979-2018. Spatial aggregation of gridded climate variables
    to regional level is weighted by area or population.
  9: Regression models were designed to analyze the relationship between a climate
    measure (proposed by A.L.) and economic data (provided by M. Kalkuhl). The authors
    contributed to the interpretation of the results.
  10: Estimated by model (7) in Table 1.
  11: Data is partitioned by above- and below-median national and regional averages
    of regional income (GRP) per capita. Data from 2008, or the closest available
    year, is used. Histograms of the distribution of national average and regional
    GRP per capita are shown with the median income indicated. Partitions from national
    data are used for Fig. 4, and regional data for Extend Data Fig. 3.
  12: Models used to estimate the marginal effects are those shown in Supplementary
    Table 9, partition shown in Extended Data Fig. 2b
More Notes:
  1: The impact of day-to-day variability is modulated by seasonal temperature difference
    and income, with the highest vulnerability in low-latitude, low-income regions
    (12 percentage-point reduction).
  2: Marginal losses from increased temperature variability are largest in low-latitude
    and coastal regions.
  4: The study controlled for the frequency of heat-stress days. Results are robust
    to different climate datasets, weighting methods, region-specific time trends,
    and exclusion of large economies or industries.
  5: The effect of day-to-day temperature variability is independent of both annual
    mean temperature and the frequency of extreme temperatures. Adaptation to the
    impact of day-to-day temperature variability is dependent on national income as
    well as long-term exposure of economic agents to large seasonal temperature differences.
  6: Spill-over effects may potentially attenuate or aggravate these effects, but
    a thorough assessment of their role requires explicit assessment of the trade,
    financial and infrastructure networks through which they may propagate and as
    such is beyond the scope of this work.
  11: The page describes the data partitioning method based on income, which seems
    to be a key step in their analysis. The maps and charts visually represent the
    distribution of income levels globally at both national and regional scales.
Quantitative material:
  1: An extra degree of temperature variability results in a five percentage-point
    reduction in regional growth rates on average.
  2: An extra degree Celsius of day-to-day temperature variability in a given year
    and region reduces the regional growth rate by at least five percentage points.
  4: Marginal change in growth rate (percentage points) based on day-to-day temperature
    variability
  5: Marginal losses from an increase in day-to-day temperature variability are generally
    larger for regions in low-income nations compared with those in higher-income
    nations. The negative impacts of day-to-day variability persist for at least two
    years following the initial shock.
