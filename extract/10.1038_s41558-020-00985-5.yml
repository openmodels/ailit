Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increases in seasonally adjusted day-to-day temperature variability
  2: Day-to-day temperature variability (measured as intra-monthly standard deviation
    of daily temperature).
  3: Day-to-day temperature variability, seasonal temperature difference, annual average
    temperature level, annual average temperature change, total annual precipitation
  4: Day-to-day temperature variability
  5: Increased day-to-day temperature variability is a driver of risk.
  6: Day-to-day temperature variability is highlighted as a risk factor affecting
    economic growth.
  8: "Day-to-day temperature variability (T~), annual average temperature (T), annual\
    \ average temperature change (\u03B4T), yearly total precipitation (P)."
  9: Day-to-day temperature variability
  10: Day-to-day temperature variability.
Highlights:
  1: Increases in day-to-day temperature variability reduce macroeconomic growth independent
    of and in addition to changes in annual average temperature; the impact of day-to-day
    variability is modulated by seasonal temperature difference and income.
  2: Day-to-day temperature variability has a negative linear effect on regional growth
    rates. Countries with smaller seasonal temperature differences are affected more
    by day-to-day temperature variability. The effect of day-to-day temperature variability
    on regional growth rates is unaffected by the inclusion of annual average temperature.
  3: Day-to-day temperature variability has a statistically significant negative impact
    on regional growth rates. Regions that experience small seasonal temperature differences
    are more strongly affected by day-to-day temperature variability, implying a latitudinal
    dependence. Model 7 is the preferred specification based on adjusted R-squared
    and BIC.
  4: The reduction in regional growth rates per extra degree of day-to-day temperature
    variability (marginal change) is larger in countries with lower GDP per capita
    (2017 values), since they tend to experience smaller seasonal temperature differences.
  5: Lower-income regions are more vulnerable to increases in day-to-day temperature
    variability than higher-income regions. This vulnerability is due to both location
    and income level. National income shields against day-to-day variability and facilitates
    better adaptation in response to historical exposure to large seasonal temperature
    differences. The negative impacts of day-to-day variability persist for at least
    two years.
  6: Previously unidentified impact of temperature variability on macroeconomic growth.
  8: Day-to-day temperature variability has a negative effect on economic growth;
    the effect of a change in day-to-day temperature variability is dependent on the
    average regional seasonal temperature difference.
  9: Day-to-day temperature variability reduces economic growth.
  10: Regions accustomed to smaller seasonal temperature differences suffer greater
    marginal losses (greater negative marginal changes) from a 1 degree increase of
    day-to-day temperature variability.
Methodology:
  1: Fixed-effects panel models using observed day-to-day temperature variability
    with subnational economic data for 1,537 regions worldwide over 40 years.
  2: "Fixed-effects panel regression models are used to exploit within-region changes\
    \ of day-to-day temperature variability and regional growth from one year to the\
    \ next. The analysis uses regional economic data and climate data from 1979-2018,\
    \ resulting in roughly 29,000 year\u2013region observations."
  3: Panel regression models were used with standard errors clustered at the regional
    level. The analysis considers lagged climate variables and controls for precipitation
    (Pr,y). The adjusted R-squared and BIC are used for model selection. Model 7 is
    selected as the preferred specification.
  4: Marginal changes are estimated from the model specification shown in Table 1,
    column (7).
  5: Panel regressions with distributed-lag model to assess the effect of changes
    in day-to-day temperature variability on economic growth. The analysis partitions
    data by median national income to compare outcomes for countries above and below
    the median. Spatial autocorrelation is addressed using error clustering specifications.
  8: Fixed-effects panel regression models are applied to estimate the effect of annual
    day-to-day temperature variability on economic growth, using regional and yearly
    fixed effects to control for unobserved differences and global shocks. Models
    also include interactions between temperature variability and average seasonal
    temperature difference, and control for annual average temperature, temperature
    change and total precipitation.
  9: Regression models are used, designed by M. Kotz and L.W.
  10: Estimated by model (7) in Table 1; The histograms show the distribution of the
    data used to estimate the model.
  11: The study partitions data based on above- and below-median national and regional
    averages of regional income (GRP) per capita, using data from 2008 or the closest
    year with available data.
More Notes:
  1: The paper tests whether the degree of variability in realizations of temperature
    has an effect on macro-economic outcomes by assessing historical changes to economic
    data and day-to-day temperature variability on a global scale. Variability is
    measured as the intra-monthly standard deviation of daily temperature, averaged
    across months of a given year.
  2: The effect of day-to-day temperature variability is modulated by the seasonal
    temperature difference (defined as the historical average of the difference between
    maximum and minimum monthly temperature of a given year). Low-latitude and coastal
    regions are most vulnerable to day-to-day temperature variability because they
    typically experience small seasonal temperature changes.
  3: The analysis focuses on regional level impacts. The gradient image illustrates
    the geographically varying effect of day-to-day temperature variability on regional
    growth rates, with the effect being larger for regions with small seasonal temperature
    differences.
  4: Day-to-day temperature variability in spring, summer and autumn has significant
    effects of similar magnitudes on annual regional growth rates. The effect of day-to-day
    temperature variability is unaltered by the inclusion of controls for the frequency
    of heat-stress days. Day-to-day temperature variability in winter on annual regional
    growth rates is statistically insignificant and of negligible magnitude, possibly
    because economic agents adapt to avoid already harsh winter weather conditions.
  5: Adaptation is likely coordinated between regions of a given country. Inequality
    is relevant for climate impacts and global mitigation efforts. The effect of day-to-day
    temperature variability is independent of both the annual mean and the frequency
    of extreme temperature.

Outcomes of Interest:
  6: "The effect of day-to-day temperature variability on macroeconomic growth is\
    \ identified as a significant impact channel in the climate\u2013economy relationship."
Quantitative Material:
  6: "A 0.2\xB0C increase in day-to-day temperature variability translates to economic\
    \ growth effects of approximately one percentage point under the central econometric\
    \ specification."
Quantitative material:
  1: An extra degree of variability results in a five percentage-point reduction in
    regional growth rates on average; highest vulnerability in low-latitude, low-income
    regions (12 percentage-point reduction).
  2: An extra degree Celsius of day-to-day temperature variability reduces the regional
    growth rate by at least five percentage points. Marginal losses can be greater
    than 10 percentage points in regions with smaller seasonal temperature differences.
  3: Table 1 presents regression results estimating the effect of climate variables
    on regional growth rates. The coefficients represent the estimated effect of a
    one-unit change in the climatic variable on the regional growth rate. For example,
    in model 7, day-to-day temperature variability has a statistically significant
    negative impact on regional growth rates (-0.115***).
  4: Figure 3 shows a scatter plot of the marginal change in growth rate (percentage
    points) against Country GDP per capita (2017 US$) and seasonal temperature difference,
    with country population (2017 values) indicated by size of points.
  5: Marginal losses from an increase in day-to-day temperature variability are generally
    larger for regions in low-income nations compared with those in higher-income
    nations. The negative impacts of day-to-day variability persist for at least two
    years following the initial shock with a partial growth recovery in the third
    year.
  8: The regression coefficients are interpreted as an estimation of the percentage-point
    change in regional growth rates per unit change of the explanatory variable.
