Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate-related hazards (droughts, floods, cyclones, landslides, sea-level rise,
    forest fires, extreme temperatures, and extreme rainfall).
  4: Droughts, cyclones, extreme rainfall, extreme temperature, forest fire, flood,
    landslide, and sea-level rise.
  6: Climate hazards (droughts, forest fires, floods, landslides, sea-level rise).
    These hazards can disrupt local production and/or interstate trade of food.
  7: Climate disasters occurring simultaneously across Indian states, sub-national
    climate hazards, pandemic restrictions disrupting food supply chains.
Highlights:
  4: Droughts present a greater risk to Indian food supply than other climate hazards,
    whereas landslides and sea-level rise present the lowest risk. The patterns of
    risk across states and climate hazards varied depending on risks to food.
  6: All Indian states are exposed to all eight climate hazards through their imported
    food supplies. Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat and Andhra
    Pradesh contribute to more than half of the climate hazard risk posed interstate
    food trade in India.
  7: Quantifies climate hazard risks to Indian food supply by distinguishing risks
    to locally produced food and imported food. Comparative risk values can identify
    hotspots for policy interventions.
Methodology:
  2: A composite indicator of exposure, hazard, and vulnerability is calculated to
    quantify risk to the food supply. Interstate trade flows are modelled using state-level
    data to estimate the source of food supply for each food item.
  4: The study quantifies climate hazard risk to food supply in Indian states by considering
    risks at food supply source. The BAMMtools package in R is used for the heatmap
    color coding. The analysis covers the period 2000-2020.
  6: The study uses trade data, modelling supply and demand balance and minimising
    transport costs, and hazard presence scores. Quantifies relationships at the state
    level. Considers sub-national geographical variation in climate hazard risks to
    food supply from local production and food supply that is imported.
  7: Assessment of hazard presence in the total land area of the state and the use
    of HDI as a composite indicator of vulnerability. Supply and demand balance model
    based on 2011-12 data.
More Notes:
  2: The analysis focuses on the supply risks associated with Indian production and
    consumption only. Data from 2011-12 is used for the trade model.
  4: The analysis distinguishes between risks to locally produced food and food imported
    from other Indian states. The presence of each climate hazard is relative to frequency
    and intensity.
  6: The study acknowledges limitations due to data availability, exclusion of foreign
    imports, PDS, and animal-sourced food products, state-level aggregation, and nutritional
    content of food groups.
  7: The study relies on recent historical data, so risks are likely to change with
    climate change. Trade patterns estimated in the study are likely to change. The
    study does not indicate the actual risk or likelihood of adverse impact, but rather
    the priority states and hazards for risk management.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Food supply risk, defined as the potential of climate hazards to cause adverse
    effects on the volume of food available for human consumption.
  4: Climate hazard risk to per capita food supply.
  6: National food security, state/national economies, food prices.
  7: Potential adverse effects on Indian food supply due to climate disasters.
Quantitative material:
  4: Climate hazard risk to per capita food supply is quantified, with heatmap color-coded
    according to natural jenks. Uttar Pradesh (R=3.8), Madhya Pradesh (R=1.7), West
    Bengal (R=1.7), Gujarat (R=1.5) and Andhra Pradesh (R=1.3) are identified as major
    states impacting interstate food trade.
  6: Mentions Uttar Pradesh exports contributing to 20% of the climate hazard risk
    of interstate food trade.
