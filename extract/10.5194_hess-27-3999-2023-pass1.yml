Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, specifically the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) SSP1-2.6,
    SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, are the drivers of risk leading to altered soil
    moisture conditions.
  2: Human activities such as greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, aerosol pollution,
    and freshwater depletion are modifying root zone soil moisture.
  3: Changes in total soil moisture content due to different Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSPs) impacting regional hydrological cycles
  7: Changes in soil moisture content (both increases and decreases) driven by different
    climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5).
  8: Changes in Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) drive changes in soil moisture,
    impacting land area experiencing wet and dry departures.
  13: "Shifts in soil moisture departing permanently from baseline levels due to climate\
    \ change scenarios (SSP1\u20132.6 and SSP3\u20137.0) impacting land areas."
  16: Anthropogenic warming and land system change captured in the SSP scenarios are
    drivers of risk, leading to transgression of the planetary boundary of green water,
    and changes in soil moisture. High-emission scenarios lead to substantial drying
    in the Amazon forest and substantial wetting in the land areas of the Indian and
    western African monsoons.
Highlights:
  1: Without climate policy, root zone soil moisture in over 25% of global land could
    be permanently beyond pre-industrial variability as early as 2050. Permanent dry
    departures are most pronounced in Central America, southern Africa, the Mediterranean
    region, and most of South America, while permanent wet departures are most pronounced
    in south-eastern South America, northern Africa, and southern Asia. Mitigation
    is crucial to avoid degrading Earth system functions upheld by soil moisture.
  2: "The study aims to determine future root zone soil moisture for 2021\u20132100\
    \ and the departures from baseline variability."
  3: Projects permanent wet or dry departures in soil moisture for different climate
    regions based on different SSPs. Determines the time of emergence of these departures.
  7: Global land area with wet or dry soil moisture departures increases from 2021
    to 2100. The extent and distribution of wet/dry departures vary across different
    SSP scenarios.
  8: A larger land area is projected to have permanent wet departures compared to
    permanent dry departures, although temporary drying may be more widespread. The
    rate of increase in land area with monthly wet departures is higher in higher
    warming scenarios, but this trend is not as consistent for dry departures.
  13: Permanent changes in soil moisture levels expected in various regions indicate
    significant long-term environmental shifts.
  16: The planetary boundary of green water might be more transgressed than previously
    thought and that the transgression will likely increase regardless of emission
    trajectory. Even with global mitigation efforts, a significant portion of land
    is expected to experience permanent soil moisture departures. Mitigation efforts
    can make a considerable difference for the degree of permanent drying and wetting
    in major regional weather systems or tipping elements.
Methodology:
  1: "The analysis uses a multi-model ensemble of 14 Earth system models (ESMs) from\
    \ the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to analyze root zone\
    \ soil moisture departures from pre-industrial climate variability. The analysis\
    \ is done for 43 ice-free climate reference regions used by the IPCC. 'Permanent\
    \ departures' are defined as when a region\u2019s soil moisture exits the regional\
    \ variability envelope of the pre-industrial climate and does not fall back into\
    \ that range until 2100. The results are applicable between 2021 and 2100."
  2: The study uses a CMIP6 multi-model ensemble with scenarios of shared socioeconomic
    pathways (SSPs) combined with emission scenarios.
  3: Analysis of total soil moisture content from 14 ESMs based on CMIP6 output under
    different SSPs (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) compared to a PiControl
    baseline to determine when regional deviations become permanent (wet or dry).
    Time of emergence is defined as when yearly mean total soil moisture content deviates
    permanently from the PiControl baseline.
  7: Uses climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) to project changes
    in soil moisture content between 2071-2100 relative to a PiControl baseline. Determines
    regional time of emergence for permanent departures. Calculates 12-month rolling
    means of monthly departures.
  8: Climate models (ESMs) are used to project changes in root zone soil moisture
    under different SSP scenarios. The time of emergence of permanent wet or dry departures
    from pre-industrial conditions is analyzed. The study covers the period from the
    present to the end of the 21st century.
  13: Analysis uses climate models to estimate soil moisture departure percentages
    and permanence through 2100, aggregating data by IPCC-defined climate reference
    regions.
  16: "The study uses CMIP6 ESM data under various SSP scenarios to analyze root zone\
    \ soil moisture departures. The CMIP6 ESM data were downloaded from Pangeo\u2019\
    s Google Cloud into a Python programming environment for the analyses. Results\
    \ are applicable to the 21st century."
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on the planetary boundary framework and the concept of a green
    water planetary boundary.
  3: The analysis uses IPCC WGI climate reference regions to avoid downscaling issues.
    Focuses on absolute changes in total soil moisture. Analysis excludes Greenland
    and Antarctica. Considers a departure permanent only if it occurs before 2095.

    or macro-fiscal outcomes.

    impacting GDP.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Permanent departures (ensemble median) occur in about 10% of global ice-free\
    \ land areas in SSP1\u20132.6 and in 25% in SSP3\u20137.0 by 2050. By the end\
    \ of the 21st century, permanent departures in SSP1\u20132.6 increase to 34% and,\
    \ in SSP3\u20137.0, to 45%."
  3: No relevant information
  8: By the end of the 21st century, 22% of ice-free land in SSP1-2.6 experiences
    a wet departure and 28% a dry departure, while in SSP3-7.0, 36% experiences a
    wet departure and 30% a dry departure. In 2050, wet departures in SSP1-2.6 are
    expected on 5% of land, and dry departures on 4%, while in SSP3-7.0 these percentages
    are 14% and 11% respectively.
  16: 18% of land surface area with permanent dry departures in SSP1-2.6, 17% in SSP2-4.5,
    17.6% in SSP3-7.0, and 26% in SSP5-8.5. Even in the SSP1-2.6 trajectory, total
    soil moisture content in 33% of the ice-free land surface area is anticipated
    to permanently depart from pre-industrial variability by the end of the 21st century.
    In about 10% of the land areas, permanent departures can be expected already by
    2050. In SSP3-7.0, 25% land area with permanent departure.
