Drivers of Risk:
  1: The paper identifies climate change as a driver impacting soil moisture, with
    scenarios modeled using shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs).
  2: Greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, aerosol pollution, freshwater depletion
  3: Changes in total soil moisture content due to different SSP scenarios (SSP1-2.6,
    SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5).
  4: Deviations in total soil moisture content from a pre-industrial baseline (PiControl)
    under different SSP scenarios, leading to wet and dry departures.
  5: Deviations in total soil moisture content due to different SSP scenarios represent
    the shocks impacting outcomes.
  7: Climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) leading to either
    wet or dry departures.
  8: The primary driver of risk is the change in soil moisture, with both wetting
    and drying trends considered under different SSP scenarios. The time of emergence
    of these trends is also a key factor.
  9: Changes in soil moisture (both drying and wetting) are driven by different SSP
    scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5).
  10: Drying and wetting of soils, precipitation changes (dominant driving mechanism),
    increased evaporative demand
  11: Changes in evaporative demand can reduce the effect of precipitation changes
    in some regions.
  12: Different SSP scenarios leading to soil moisture exceeding or falling below
    certain percentiles of a PiControl baseline; land cover and its change.
  13: The drivers of risk are changes in soil moisture (wet or dry departures) under
    different climate change scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0).
  14: Changes in total soil moisture leading to wet or dry departures from pre-industrial
    baseline.
  15: Different SSP scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP3-7.0, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5) impacting soil
    moisture content; Seasonal variations (Boreal Summer, Boreal Winter)
  16: Anthropogenic warming and land system change captured in the SSP scenarios.

  15: Root zone soil moisture departures from pre-industrial variability
  16: Planetary boundary of green water/root zone soil moisture departures
Highlights:
  1: Key outcomes include the projection that root zone soil moisture will experience
    permanent wet or dry departures in over 25% of global land by 2050 without climate
    policy interventions.
  2: "Goal is to determine the future climatic state of root zone soil moisture for\
    \ possible future climates (2021\u20132100)."
  3: Determines the time of emergence for permanent wet or dry soil moisture departures
    under different SSPs. Computes the net number of ESMs projecting a permanent departure
    in each region (wet - dry).
  4: Future deviations from the pre-industrial baseline in soil moisture content are
    shown to vary greatly between ESMs, up to a factor of 10, however, the global
    distribution appears similar. The deviation in soil moisture content from PiControl
    to different SSPs show quite similar magnitudes.
  5: The Mediterranean region is anticipated to be significantly impacted by drying
    in warmer scenarios, with other regions experiencing opposite effects.
  7: Global land area with wet or dry soil moisture departures is projected to increase
    from 2021 to 2100 under all SSP scenarios. The spatial distribution of wet and
    dry departures varies across different SSP scenarios, with some regions becoming
    predominantly wetter or drier depending on the scenario.
  8: A larger land area is predicted to have permanent wet departures than permanent
    dry departures, although the trend is not always consistent with the warming trend
    for dry departures. The yearly mean soil moisture results show more regions will
    become drier in higher warming scenarios, but this drying may not be permanent
    according to the study's definition.
  9: Under SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0, seasonal wet and dry departures are comparable,
    but seasonal dry departure remains higher in boreal summer than in boreal winter
    throughout the study period. In SSP3-7.0, the land area with wet departures is
    much larger than for dry departures in boreal winter.
  10: Some regions (MED, CNA, SSA, SWS, SAM, WSAF, SAU) tend to become drier or wetter
    (SES, NEAF, SAS, WSB, SAH) regardless of season; High-latitude regions tend to
    become drier in summer and wetter in winter.
  11: Model spread is not detrimental to the presented analyses.
  12: ESMs have high uncertainties in regions like the Sahel and Amazon; there are
    conflicting departure signals in many regions, particularly at higher northern
    latitudes; model spread is similar to that observed since CMIP5; land cover change
    and different ESM responses to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide contribute
    to variability in soil moisture projections.
  13: Some models have high ECS values, which could lead to more widespread and pronounced
    soil moisture departures. Wet departures are found in very dry regions, but the
    absolute changes in soil moisture are of low magnitudes, limiting implications
    for water availability and the ecosystem response.
  15: Land surface area with permanent wet departures from pre-industrial soil moisture
    variability is expected to increase by the end of the 21st century, with higher
    increases under higher SSP scenarios. The agreement between the ESMs in Asia is
    lower than in other continents.
  16: High-emission scenarios are expected to lead to substantial drying in the Amazon
    forest and substantial wetting in the land areas of the Indian and western African
    monsoons.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis uses a multi-model ensemble of 14 Earth system models in CMIP6 under
    four climate scenarios, examining root zone soil moisture departures.
  2: "Uses CMIP6 multi-model ensemble of total soil moisture with Pre-industrial Control\
    \ (Pi-Control) scenario as baseline and four different future scenarios of shared\
    \ socioeconomic pathways (SSPs): SSP1\u20132.6, SSP2\u20134.5, SSP3\u20137.0,\
    \ and SSP5\u20138.5 (O\u2019Neill et al.,2016;Riahi et al.,2017). Aggregates all\
    \ data to the scale of the IPCC Working Group I (WGI) climate reference regions\
    \ (Iturbide et al.,2020a). Determines departures from the baseline on monthly\
    \ and yearly scales. Analyses whether the departures are permanent and determines\
    \ the \u201Ctime of emergence\u201D (when soil moisture moves beyond and does\
    \ not fall back within the envelope of baseline variability before 2100)."
  3: Uses total soil moisture content from 14 CMIP6 ESMs. Compares soil moisture from
    SSPs (2021-2100) with a PiControl baseline to determine when deviations become
    permanent (defined as exceeding the 5th or 95th percentile of PiControl and not
    returning before 2100). Time of emergence is calculated for each region and ESM.
    Regions where soils are permanently frozen are excluded.
  4: The analysis involves comparing total soil moisture content from SSP scenarios
    to a PiControl baseline. It identifies the time of emergence for wet and dry departures
    and calculates the percentage of land area experiencing permanent deviations.
    Monthly and yearly total soil moisture content are used.
  7: Analysis of monthly soil moisture departures compared to a PiControl baseline.  Identification
    of when soil moisture content exceeds the 95th or falls below the 5th percentile.
    Uses 12-month rolling means.  Yearly permanent departures consider land area with
    departure after the regional time of emergence. Results applicable from 2021-2100.
  8: The analysis uses ESMs (Earth System Models) and examines the time of emergence
    of permanent wet or dry root zone soil moisture departures under different SSP
    scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) relative to pre-industrial
    conditions. The analysis considers monthly departures and permanent departures,
    defining permanent departures based on a time of emergence.
  9: The number of months with dry/wet departures is calculated from the numbers of
    months in each model within the ensemble. Seasonal mean land area with permanent
    wet and dry departures is compared for boreal summer (JJA) and boreal winter (DJF)
    for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0.
  10: Analysis of root zone soil moisture departures from PiControl baseline variability
    under SSP1-2.6 scenario, using data from multiple climate models. Focus is on
    identifying regions with permanent departures (drying or wetting).
  11: Analysis uses ensembles of ESM projections. Model spread is treated as reflecting
    the wide range of potential futures, stemming from different yet equally valid
    hypotheses and mechanics in ESMs.
  12: Analysis based on ESMs (Earth System Models) under different SSP scenarios;
    comparison to a PiControl baseline; assessment of conflicting departure signals
    among ESMs.
  13: The analysis uses CMIP6 climate models and aggregates data using IPCC climate
    reference regions. Permanence is defined as a departure without reversal until
    2100. Ensemble medians are used to report land areas with permanent departures.
  14: Analyzed future changes in total soil moisture in IPCC reference regions using
    CMIP6 data from 14 ESMs under four scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and
    SSP5-8.5) relative to a pre-industrial baseline (1850-like conditions) from 2021-2100.
    Evaluated deviation of total soil moisture, permanent departures, and time of
    emergence of these departures.
  15: Analysis based on ESMs (Earth System Models) and comparison of SSP scenarios
    against a PiControl (pre-industrial control) baseline in 2100.
  16: Analysis based on CMIP6 ESM data.
More Notes:
  3: Focuses on absolute changes in total soil moisture, assuming these changes reflect
    the hydrological active zone where plant roots are active. Uses IPCC WGI climate
    reference regions for analysis.
  4: The study uses ACCESS-CM2 model data for the example in Figure 1, and analyzes
    data from 4 of 14 ESMs in Figure 2. It focuses on root zone soil moisture, defining
    it as the control variable for the green water planetary boundary.
  7: The time of emergence for regional soil moisture changes is specified in Tables
    S2-S5 (not provided). The study uses the 95th and 5th percentiles to define significant
    wet and dry departures, respectively.
  8: Figure 6 shows the distribution of the time of emergence of all ESMs for different
    climate regions showing either wet or dry departures under different SSPs.
  9: The maps indicate that under higher SSP scenarios (SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5), many
    regions experience extreme temperature conditions for most of the year and pronounced
    changes in precipitation for the majority of the year.
  10: A quantitative analysis of water balance terms (precipitation, runoff, and evaporation)
    was considered beyond the scope of this paper.
  11: The uncertainty associated with the capacity of the ESMs to project the water
    cycle is a limitation.
  12: The graphs show the percentage of land area affected by extreme soil moisture
    conditions (wet or dry) under different climate scenarios from 2020 to 2100.
  13: The interpretation of results can be different depending on whether ensemble
    means or medians are used.
  14: The CNRM-ESM2-1 model reported much higher dry departures than other models.
    Agreement between ESMs is higher in regions with strong departure signals.
