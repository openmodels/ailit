  42: The analysis examines the relationship between Aggregate Climate Index (ACI)
    and expected default frequency (EDF) of firms.
  43: The interaction of an unspecified 'ACI' (potentially an aggregate climate index)
    and firms with low levels of fixed assets, non-current assets, or tangible assets.

    Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU), financial stress (stress), leverage of non-financial
    firms (leverage), and per capita value of outstanding bonds issued by local government
    financing vehicles (LGFV bond).'
  45: The ACI (variable name only specified) seems to be a key independent variable,
    though it's not specified as to what this is, but from the text, it appears to
    be a measure of risk (probably climate related).
  46: "Asset Climate Index (ACI), Entrepreneurs\u2019 Confidence (Confidence), Purchasing\
    \ Managers\u2019 Index: New Orders (PMI-New-order), Overall Purchasing Managers\u2019\

Highlights:
  2: Negative weather shocks lead to persistently low GDP and credit obtained by non-financial
    firms in China; credit risk and expectations amplify the negative effects of extreme
    weather on loans.
  4: Weather shocks have a contractionary effect on GDP, with credit acting as an
    important propagation mechanism; Extreme weather events reduce loans obtained
    by listed firms, which then leads to a drop in firm-level output; Expected default
    risk rises after extreme weather shocks; Macroeconomic factors that contribute
    to credit risk worsen the negative effects of extreme weather; Extreme weather
    shocks cause stock analysts to downgrade ratings and reduce profit forecasts.
  5: Extreme weather events affect credit through credit risk and expectations; adverse
    effects of extreme weather become more prominent over time; climate change elevates
    credit risk in financial markets.
  6: Extreme weather adversely impacts output and credit at both macroeconomic and
    microeconomic levels. Climate risks affect firm-level credit access by elevating
    credit risk.
  8: The Chinese ACI shows a trend of increased extreme weather patterns after 2015,
    indicating higher weather risks.
  9: The ACI series provides a reasonable measure of weather risks from 1990 to 2020
    based on Chinese meteorological data.
  10: Weather shocks have a significant and persistent negative impact on GDP in China.
  11: Weather shocks lead to persistently low economic activities; Short-term monetary
    easing is insufficient for averting the long-term impact of weather shocks on
    credit access; The impact of weather risks on GDP varies over time
  12: Weather shocks are quantitatively important in explaining fluctuations in GDP,
    CPI, and credit obtained by non-financial firms in the long term.
  13: Extreme weather shocks have persistent negative effects on aggregate output.
    The central bank should consider the effects of weather shocks when implementing
    monetary policy. Weather shocks also affect credit obtained by non-financial firms.
  14: Non-state-owned enterprises are identified as more financially constrained and
    therefore more sensitive to extreme weather conditions.
  15: Significant negative impact of extreme weather on bank loans, with a drop in
    loan to assets ratio ranging from 0.232 to 0.568 percentage points depending on
    the specification.
  16: Extreme weather shocks significantly increase the expected default probability,
    which is associated with a reduction in bank loans.
  17: Extreme weather depresses bank loans by increasing firm-level default risk.
    Firms with less collateral face more difficulty obtaining loans after extreme
    weather shocks. The adverse effects of extreme weather on firm-level loans are
    more severe when monetary policy is tighter.
  18: Extreme weather has a more adverse effect on bank loans when economic policy
    uncertainty levels and financial stress are high; Drop in loans is greater when
    macroeconomic credit risk is higher.
  19: Extreme weather dampens market expectations, hindering credit access of listed
    companies; Higher corporate confidence mitigates the negative effects of weather
    shocks on credit access.
  20: Non-SOE, younger, and smaller firms experience a greater reduction in bank loans
    following extreme weather shocks compared to SOE, older, and larger firms, respectively.
    ACI effect on primary sector firms' loans is statistically insignificant, likely
    due to small sample size.
  21: Extreme weather reduces long- and short-term loans; long-term loans experience
    a larger impact than short-term loans; extreme weather increases firms' interest
    rate expenses; the impact of extreme weather on loans is less severe for firms
    in the secondary sector which have higher non-current assets.
  22: Extremely high and low temperatures, concentrated precipitation, and drought
    are negatively related to financing at the firm level. Strong winds have positive
    effects. Results are robust to alternative treatments of extremely low temperatures
    in the climate risk index.
  23: Extreme weather shocks have significant and negative effects on GDP and firm-level
    output (value added).
  24: Negative, statistically significant impact of ACI on firm's value-added.
  25: Effects of the ACI shock are asymmetric; negative effects are stronger in high-weather-risk
    regimes.
  26: Negative weather shocks depress GDP and credit in the long term and lower interest
    rates in the short term. The impact of weather shocks becomes more severe if monetary
    policy does not loosen after the shocks. Climate risk likely reduces the supply
    of bank loans.
  27: Extreme weather has a significant impact on the Chinese economy, particularly
    on the credit access of Chinese firms.
  28: Climate change may affect real estate prices if people believe in it. Temperature
    has a non-linear effect on economic production. Adaptation to climate change is
    studied in US agriculture.
  30: Adaptation mitigates the negative effect of temperature shocks on household
    consumption.
  31: Climate change impacts mortgage credit costs, municipal bond yields, productivity,
    labor supply, financial stress in emerging markets, and agricultural output.
  32: Shows trends in the overall ACI for China and contributions of various climate
    factors like extreme temperatures, precipitation, drought and wind to overall
    climate index
  34: A one standard deviation weather shock leads to a decrease in GDP, CPI, Rate,
    and Credit.
  36: Monetary policy intervention mitigates the negative impact of weather shocks
    on output. The green dashed line represents the would-be responses of output to
    a one standard deviation weather shock in a counterfactual scenario in which monetary
    policy does not react to the weather shock.
  40: ACI shocks explain a substantial portion of their own variance (94-100%). The
    impact of ACI shocks on GDP increases over time, peaking around Q16 before decreasing
    by Q200. The impact on CPI and credit also increases over time.
  41: There are statistically significant relationships between the drivers of risk
    (e.g., policy uncertainty) and the outcomes of interest (e.g., ACI, ROA). Many
    coefficients are marked with ***, **, and *, indicating statistical significance.
    Several coefficients are negative (e.g., -0.374*** for the Baseline model), suggesting
    that increased uncertainty or volatility can negatively impact the outcomes. Some
    of the relationships are non-linear with jumps between consecutive periods. The
    coefficients for certain drivers on ACI and tangible ROA may be of interest for
    assessing climate-related financial risk
  42: ACI positively correlates with EDF, indicating possible increased credit risk
    linked to climate indices.
  43: Firms with lower levels of fixed, non-current, or tangible assets experience
    a greater reduction in access to bank loans (relative to their total assets) when
    interacting with the 'ACI'.
  44: ACI has a statistically significant negative impact on the loan/asset ratio
    in all models. The interactions of ACI with tight monetary policy, economic policy
    uncertainty, financial stress and LGFV bond values also have statistically significant
    negative impacts on the loan/asset ratio. Leverage shows no statistically significant
    relationship.
  45: ACI has a statistically significant impact on analyst ratings and profit forecasts.
    Increasing ACI is associated with increasing rating and reduced profit forecast.
  46: ACI and its interaction with confidence and PMI measures are significantly related
    to the bank loan ratio to total assets. Specifically, higher ACI is associated
    with a lower loan/asset ratio, and the interaction terms suggest that confidence
    and PMI can moderate this effect. The dependent variable's mean is 14.842, and
    the R2 is 0.593 for all models.
  48: The coefficients for secondary and tertiary industries are statistically significant
    (***), indicating a strong relationship with the dependent variable (ACI).
  49: Increased ACI is significantly associated with decreased long and short term
    debt and higher interest expenses for firms.
  50: Drought, Rain, Lowtemp, P10 and P90 all have statistically significant effects
    on the outcome (loan/asset ratio), indicating that various climate risks are significantly
    correlated with this financial variable.
  51: Tangible assets and credit seem to be significant factors, with effects visible
    across different regressions.
  52: ACI has a negative and significant impact on bank loans to total assets and
    log value-added, indicating potential climate-related financial risks.
  53: Climate risk (ACI) has a negative and statistically significant impact on bank
    loans.

  40: Variance decomposition analysis is used to assess the impact of ACI shocks on
    macroeconomic variables.
  41: Panel regressions with firm and time fixed effects. Robust standard errors are
    used. Analysis seems to be at the firm level, potentially aggregated to a national
    level. It appears to be examining the effects of economic policy uncertainty,
    market volatility, and monetary aggregates (M2) on firm-level financial performance
    and climate risk indicators. The results are applicable for the time period covered

More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on China.
  4: The analysis focuses on China. The ACI index is likely some sort of weather index,
    but this is not explicitly defined in this extract.
  5: The study emphasizes the role of credit in the propagation of weather shocks
    and provides firm-level evidence to complement the macroeconomic analysis.
  6: The paper focuses on China from 1990 to 2020. It analyzes the impact of climate
    risk on Chinese firms' credit access, considering the importance of bank credit
    in the Chinese financial system.
  9: The ACI has five components and is validated against the China Climate Risk Index.
    The construction of the ACI follows methodology of the American Academy of Actuaries
    and Canadian Institute of Actuaries
  10: The study focuses on China's macroeconomy and uses the Agricultural Climate
    Index (ACI) as a proxy for weather shocks.
  11: The study uses drought indicator (Dstd), concentrated precipitation indicator
    (Rstd), and extreme low temperature indicator (P10std) to represent weather risks.
  12: The central bank has not regarded climate risk as an important factor in monetary
    policy until recently.
  13: The analysis suggests that monetary policy intervention can lessen the negative
    impact of weather shocks on GDP.
  17: The paper uses firm-level data to infer macroeconomic consequences, focusing
    on the credit channel.
  19: The analysis focuses on listed companies in a specific country (implied by the
    CSMAR database). The expectations channel is identified as an important mechanism.
  20: The study focuses on firm-level impacts in China and uses firm-level heterogeneity
    to examine how different types of firms are affected by climate shocks.
  21: The analysis uses interaction terms between ACI (presumably a measure of extreme
    weather) and non-current assets to assess the moderating effect of assets on the
    impact of extreme weather.
  22: The original ACI methodology assumed the absence of extremely low temperatures
    leads to disasters, but the paper explores an alternative treatment where extremely
    low temperatures are considered a risk due to potential economic losses.
  23: Value added is constructed using data from balance sheets and income statements,
    using methods from GDP accounting in China.
  26: The study focuses on China. The ACI is constructed to measure Chinese extreme
    weather.
  27: The study identifies credit risk and market expectations as channels through
    which extreme weather impacts firm credit financing.
  30: The papers touch on climate finance, financial stability, and the macroeconomy,
    potentially offering insights into fiscal risks and adaptation costs/benefits.
    Several papers examine the role of institutions and finance.
  32: The ACI provides an aggregate measure of extreme weather. However, the link
    to specific macroeconomic and fiscal outcomes is not explicitly established in
    this excerpt.
  40: Table 2 provides summary statistics of Chinese firms, including loan/asset ratio,
    value-added, sales, asset size, tangible assets, ROA, long-term debt, short-term
    debt, interest expenses, Non-SOE indicator, and age, although these do not seem
    directly linked to climate adaptation or risk analysis on this page. 'ACI' is
    undefined on this page.
  41: The dependent variables are firm-level indicators (ACI, ROA, asset value, etc.).
    The analysis explores the interplay between macroeconomic factors and firm-level
    responses. The table includes control variables like firm age. The notes suggest
    that the tangible assets and aggregate volatility (VIX) are used to assess the
    effects on the economy. The regressions include variables measuring the monetary
    gap.
  43: '''ACI'' is lagged by one quarter. The model includes control variables, but
    they are not specified on this page. The R-squared values suggest that the model
    explains a substantial portion of the variance in the loan/asset ratio (between
    0.593 and 0.606).'
  44: The analysis focuses on the credit risk channel and how climate change impacts
    interact with other economic factors to influence bank lending behavior. The paper
    uses 'Asset Climate Impact (ACI)' as a core measure of exposure.
  45: The definition of ACI is critical for interpreting the results. The analyst
    ratings and profit forecasts are likely capturing expectations about firm performance
    rather than direct macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, but these may represent
    future real economy effects. 'Controls' reference to Table 3 column 2 provides
    missing information about other independent variables, but is not present on this
    page.
  46: The dependent variable is the bank loans ratio to total assets, which might
    be relevant as a proxy for investment or economic activity. The coefficients might
    be helpful to build more complex quantitative models.
  48: The notation is dense and requires further context to fully understand the variables
    and their relationships. The meaning of 'ACI' and 'low' needs clarification.
  49: The analysis is at the firm level, not the national level, and is therefore
    of indirect relevance. The nature of ACI is not clarified.
  50: The asterisks (***, **, *) denote statistical significance levels (likely 1%,
    5%, and 10%). The values in parentheses are likely standard errors. The sample
    period seems to start prior to 1989 and there is a variable ('1960-1989') that
    appears to be an indicator variable. There are a number of potentially relevant
    but unclear acronyms. The variables are standardized in some way, which allows
    coefficients to be comparable across different variables.
  51: The data seems to be firm-level data, aggregated to some degree. The variables
    used include ACI (unclear what this is), ROA, asset size, leverage, and measures
    of uncertainty (gepu, us_mpuvix). It may be relevant to clarify that it is US
    data. There is also information on 'loan' conditions.
  53: The loan demand index also significantly impacts bank loans.

    ln(asset) (log of asset value), lever (leverage), gdp (Gross Domestic Product),
    creditto_cons (credit to consumers)
  43: Firm-level access to bank loans, measured as the ratio of bank loans to total
    assets.
  44: Bank loan ratio to total assets (loan/asset).
  45: Analyst ratings (mean, mode, discrete average) and analysts' forecasts of net
    profit are used as proxies for expectations that may eventually affect macroeconomic
    outcomes. No direct measures of GDP, productivity, inflation, fiscal balances,
    etc. are present.
  46: Bank loans ratio to total assets (loan/asset).
  48: The paper seems to examine the impact of ACI (potentially referring to an Asset
    Class Index or a similar concept) on a dependent variable (Dep.) at different
    industry levels.
  49: The impact of the ACI (a firm-level measure of climate risk exposure) on long-term
    debt to asset ratio, short-term debt to asset ratio, and log of interest expenses.
  50: The outcomes of interest appear to be related to measures denoted as ACI_b,
    ACI_c, and ACI_d, potentially related to a Climate Risk Index or similar construct.
    The dependent variable is 'loan/asset', which may proxy for financial stability
    within the economy.
  51: GDP effects appear to be a primary outcome. Mentions of 'economic costs' and
    'return' may be relevant.
  53: Bank loans (log of bank loans reported on listed banks' balance sheets).
Outcomes of Interest:
  18: Impacts on bank loans obtained by firms, economic policy uncertainty, financial
    stress, and measures of leverage at the macroeconomic level.
  52: The dependent variables are bank loans ratio to total assets and log value-added,
    which may indirectly relate to macroeconomic outcomes.
Quantitative material:
  2: Negative weather shocks lead to persistently low GDP and credit obtained by non-financial
    firms; negative effects of weather shocks on firm level loans were statistically
    and practically significant.
  4: GDP drops by 0.5% in the third quarter following a one standard deviation shock
    to the ACI index; ACI shocks account for 14.2% of the variation in GDP in the
    long term; Without central bank reaction, the drop in GDP following a one-standard-deviation
    weather shock will worsen from -0.42% to -0.49% in the long term.
  5: Evidence that climate risk causes high-exposure counties to pay more underwriting
    fees and initial yields, to issue long-term municipal bonds.
  6: Study suggests that monetary policies should adequately address weather shocks
    in an environment with significant climate change.
  9: Correlation coefficient between ACI and China Climate Risk Index is 0.44 (0.50
    with alternative ACI). Mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of the quarterly
    ACI are -0.017, -1.66, 2.16, and 0.86, respectively.
  10: A one-standard-deviation weather shock leads to a persistent negative response
    in GDP, with a drop of 0.2% in the first quarter and a maximum drop of 0.5% in
    the third quarter.
  11: GDP drop of approximately 0.4%; CPI inflation becomes negative and significant
    starting from the 12th quarter, reaching approximately -0.1%; Interest rate drops
    to lowest point of -0.1% in the third quarter
  12: Weather shocks explained a 1% drop in GDP in 2020. In the long term (200th quarter),
    weather risks account for 14.2% of the variance in GDP, 11.5% of CPI variation,
    4.7% of interest rate variation, and 13.8% of credit obtained by non-financial
    firms variation.
  13: A one-standard-deviation weather shock leads to a 0.42% drop in GDP after 20
    quarters with actual monetary policy response, and a 0.49% drop in GDP after 20
    quarters if monetary policy doesn't react to weather shocks.
  14: The dataset includes 4,186 firms and 251,160 firm-quarter observations with
    a focus on the mean ratio of bank loans to total assets.
  15: One-unit increase in ACI causes the bank loans to assets ratio to drop by 0.232
    percentage point.
  17: Coefficients of ACI (a measure of extreme weather) are negative in various regressions.
    Interaction coefficients between ACI and collateral proxies are significant and
    negative. The interaction coefficient between tight monetary policy and extreme
    weather is negative.
  19: "Negative and statistically significant coefficients in regressions of firm-level\
    \ ratings by stock analysts on the ACI; Extreme weather shocks significantly decreasing\
    \ analysts\u2019 forecasts of firm profits; Positive and significant coefficients\
    \ for interaction terms of ACI and Entrepreneurs\u2019 Confidence Index (ECI),\
    \ Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI), and new-order component of the PMI index."
  20: The coefficients of the interaction terms between ACI and firm heterogeneity
    variables (NonSOE, young, small-size, small-sales) are negative and significant
    in regressions. For the primary sector listed firm subsample, ACI has an insignificant
    coefficient, with a t-statistic of 1.137.
  21: The impact of extreme weather on loans is less severe for firms in the secondary
    sector which have higher non-current assets.
  22: 'ACI_b coefficient: -0.264; ACI coefficient: -0.232; ACI_c coefficient: -0.347'
  23: The coefficient of ACI_d is -0.240, similar to the benchmark estimate of -0.232.
    This suggests a negative relationship between the climate index and economic outcomes.
  24: "A one-unit change in the ACI index reduces a firm\u2019s value-added by 0.8%."
  26: A one standard deviation shock to ACI leads to a 0.5% drop in GDP in the third
    quarter. Weather shocks account for 14.2% of GDP fluctuations in the long run.
    Bank loans drop after an ACI shock.
  27: "Loans drop after weather events; Effect of extreme weather shocks is more pronounced\
    \ when firm-level and macro-level credit risks are higher; extreme weather shocks\
    \ dampen market expectations, and their impact on firms is larger when firm managers\u2019\
    \ expectations and confidence are low."
  28: The Burke et al. (2015) paper quantifies the non-linear effect of temperature
    on economic production.

    ACI values for various extreme weather events
  34: GDP decreases by approximately 0.8 percent after 20 quarters; CPI decreases
    by approximately 0.1 percent after 20 quarters; Rate decreases by approximately
    0.15 percent after 20 quarters; Credit decreases by approximately 0.4 percent
    after 20 quarters.

    with and without monetary policy reaction.
  40: Table 1 provides variance decomposition of GDP, CPI, interest rates, and credit
    explained by ACI shocks at different time horizons (1 quarter, 4 quarters, 8 quarters,
    16 quarters, and 200 quarters).
  41: Regression coefficients and standard errors are presented for various models
    (1)-(7), along with R-squared values and number of observations. Specific coefficients
    are given for the impact of various drivers (e.g., gepu, mpu_usvix, m2) on the
    outcome variables (ACI, tangible ROA, etc.)
  42: Coefficient of ACI on EDF is 0.004 with high significance.
  43: A statistically significant negative relationship between 'ACI' interacted with
    low levels of fixed assets, non-current assets, or tangible assets, and the loan/asset
    ratio. The coefficients are -0.438, -0.292, and -0.113 respectively (all significant
    at the 1% level). 'ACI' alone also has a negative and statistically significant
    impact on the loan/asset ratio.
  44: The table presents regression coefficients and standard errors for the impact
    of ACI and its interactions with other variables on the bank loan ratio to total
    assets. For example, ACI*tight MP has a coefficient of -0.371*** (significant
    at the 1% level).
  45: A 1-unit increase in ACI is associated with a statistically significant increase
    in average rating (0.008-0.010 depending on rating type) and a decrease in profit
    forecast (-0.009) all at the 1% significance level.
  46: The table provides regression results with coefficients and standard errors
    for the relationships between ACI, confidence, PMI measures, and the loan/asset
    ratio. E.g., ACI*Confidence has a coefficient of 0.019*** (significant at 1%).
    ACI has a coefficient of -0.271*** (significant at 1%).
  48: 'There are coefficients and standard errors presented, suggesting a regression
    analysis. Examples: tertiary -0.216***(0.063), secondary -0.241***(0.034).  R-squared
    values are also reported (e.g., 14.842).'
  49: A one-unit increase in ACI is associated with a -0.040 decrease in the long-term
    debt to asset ratio (significant at 1%), a -0.017 decrease in the short-term debt
    to asset ratio (significant at 1%), and a 0.030 increase in log interest expenses
    (significant at 1%).
  50: There are coefficient estimates presented for the impact of each climate variable
    on the dependent variable. For example, Drought has a coefficient of -0.320***,
    indicating a statistically significant negative impact. Rain has a coefficient
    of -0.268***.
  52: Quantitative information is provided regarding the relationships between the
    ACI and the dependent variables, including coefficients and significance levels.
  53: A one unit increase in the climate risk index (ACI) is associated with a statistically
    significant decrease in bank loans; -0.015 (significant at the 1% level) in model
    (1) and -0.003 (significant at the 5% level) in model (2).
