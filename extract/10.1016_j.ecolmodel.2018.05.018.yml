Highlights:
  3: Ocean acidification leads to declines in Dungeness crab populations, resulting
    in economic consequences (revenue, income, employment) concentrated in northern
    California to northern Washington State.
  6: The study explores spatially heterogeneous impacts of ocean acidification on
    species and fisheries in the California Current at finer spatial scales (port-level),
    which has not been previously estimated.
  7: Identifies where future research, monitoring and management focus is needed by
    exploring the potential consequences of pH changes and vulnerabilities for port
    revenue, income and employment in US west coast communities.
  13: The study focuses on effects on fisheries catch under ocean acidification.
  14: The study estimates the direct, indirect, and induced economic effects of changes
    in fisheries revenue using the IO-PAC model.
  17: Changes in biomass and revenue reported only when effect size is greater than
    |0.2|.
  18: Demersal functional groups were most affected by changes in pH, with sixteen
    groups experiencing biomass effect sizes of |0.20| or greater.
  21: Declines in revenue were dominated by declines in Dungeness crab, with effect
    sizes between -0.42 and -1.0+ at the nine U.S. ports north of Fort Bragg, CA.
  22: Tillamook experienced the largest decline in revenue as a result of declines
    in pH due to Dungeness crab.
  23: Ocean acidification will likely have widespread negative impacts on revenue,
    income, and employment across various vessel types and ports, although the magnitude
    varies depending on the port and vessel type. Oregon and Washington (from Brookings
    north) are projected to see the most detrimental effects from ocean acidification
    on three vessel types (hake trawlers, sablefish fixed gear, and large trawlers),
    despite some relief for crabbers from increases in pandalid shrimp.
  24: The largest economic consequences may occur for central and northern west coast
    ports that rely on demersal species, particularly Dungeness crab.
  26: Indirect food web effects (loss of prey) made Dungeness crab populations vulnerable,
    which impacts fishery revenue.
  32: Significant economic impacts from changes in Dungeness crab biomass on the US
    West Coast.
  48: Shows change in revenue under future ocean acidification levels for functional
    groups making up at least 90% of port-level fishery revenue in 2013.
  49: Port-level revenue, income, and employment changes are visualized in Figure
    4. The drivers of these changes, broken down by fleet, are shown in Figure 5.

Methodology:
  3: An ecosystem model (Atlantis) forced by oceanographic projections and coupled
    to an economic input-output model is used. The model explores how ocean acidification
    may influence the coastline from Vancouver Island to Baja California.
  6: The study employs oceanographic predictions from a Regional Oceanographic Modeling
    System (ROMS) model, forced by an earth system model (GFDL-ESM2M) under climate
    scenario RCP8.5; an Atlantis end-to-end marine ecosystem model; and an economic
    input-output model.
  7: An ecosystem model (Atlantis) is used to investigate the impacts of ocean acidification
    in the California Current and consequences for fishing communities along the US
    west coast. Outputs from a fine-scale ocean model provided physical forcing for
    Atlantis for the present and 50 years in the future. Outputs from Atlantis were
    then passed to an economic input-output model (IO-PAC) for the west coast of the
    US. Analysis is focused on the US west coast and 17 port groups.
  13: Atlantis model is used to project port-level catches. Fishing mortality is set
    at a constant rate, spatially allocated to 17 US port groups, plus Canada and
    Mexico. Assumes no management responses or shifts in regimes/fishery behavior.
    Vessels have access to coastal areas within 200km of the homeport and offshore
    areas to 1200m depth.
  14: 'Input-Output (IO) model (IO-PAC) used to estimate direct, indirect, and induced
    effects of changes in fisheries revenue on income and employment. Direct effect:
    Impacts at the vessel level. Indirect effect: Secondary activity due to changing
    input needs of directly affected industries. Induced effects: Changes in household
    spending.'
  15: Uses a customized Input-Output model called IO-PAC, built on IMPLAN software.
    The model estimates the effects of changes in fish harvest on income and employment
    by harvesting vessels and processors at the scale of port and vessel type.
  17: Analysis focuses on changes in biomass and revenue due to pH levels using a
    100-year model run, isolating pH effects by comparing results with baseline and
    controlled scenarios.
  18: The economic analysis was performed using multipliers from the IO-PAC model
    to consider direct, indirect, and induced effects on income and employment. The
    effect size on income and employment was calculated as the difference between
    scenarios in 2063 and standardized by 2013Baseline.
  21: Atlantis simulations were used to project port revenue under different pH scenarios.
    Baseline simulation year is 2013.
  22: Analysis is based on revenue changes, income multipliers, and employment multipliers
    by vessel type.
  23: Model that parses port-level revenue to vessel type and considers a 100-year
    spinup to 2063 conditions.
  24: A modeling framework is used to project regionally varying biological and economic
    impacts of ocean acidification within the California Current, using a combination
    of the ROMS model, a spatially explicit ecosystem model, and spatially resolved
    fishing revenues used in an IO model. The Atlantis model is used for strategic
    management and exploration of ecosystem dynamics, in the spirit of scenario analysis.
  26: A model was used where direct effects from pH-induced mortality are insubstantial,
    but indirect food web effects made Dungeness crab populations quite vulnerable.
    ROMS oceanographic model was used and compared to alternative methods like uniform
    mortality rates, and direct use of global circulation models (GCMs)
  32: Integration of physical, ecological, and economic consequences at spatial resolutions
    compatible with human communities and management decisions.
  48: Uses the Atlantis model to simulate changes in biomass and revenue under future
    ocean acidification levels.
  49: Analysis performed at the port level. Fleet landing data from 2013 are used.

More Notes:
  3: The model focuses on the California Current and highlights the importance of
    tracking Dungeness crab productivity for long-term planning.
  7: The paper focuses specifically on the US West Coast fishing industry and the
    impact of ocean acidification. It uses a combination of ecosystem and input-output
    modeling to project impacts 50 years into the future.
  13: The model simplifies reality by assuming constant fishing rates and no changes
    in management, which allows for isolation of the effects of ocean acidification.
    The study acknowledges challenges in accurately modeling the dynamics of all species
    in complex ecosystem models. Crangon shrimp were removed from economic analyses.
  14: The IO-PAC model appears to be specific to Pacific Coast fisheries, limiting
    its generalizability without modification.
  15: IO-PAC assumes supply is not constraining, prices of commodities and factors
    of production are fixed (in 2013 dollars), and there is no substitution in production
    or consumption.
  21: Indirect food web effects drove changes in revenue.
  22: Some ports experienced relief from Dungeness crab declines with increases in
    pandalid shrimp revenue. The effect on employment at times more exaggerated than
    the effect on revenue and income due to differences in the income versus employment
    multipliers by vessel type.
  23: The impact on Diver vessels in the south may be confounded by difficulties in
    maintaining initial densities of nearshore urchins during model calibration.
  26: The variability in pH conditions and resulting ecological impacts was driven
    in part by the oceanographic model (ROMS).
  48: The response metric standardizes the decline in biomass by the 2013 baseline,
    which can lead to changes greater than 1.0 if the 2013 baseline was lower than
    the 2063 baseline.
