Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Climate-induced sea-level rise due to a temperature rise of 4\xB0C or more."
  10: Mean sea-level rise, storm surges (sea and river floods), coastal erosion (direct
    and indirect).
  11: Sea-level rise is a driver of risk, impacting coastal regions.
  12: Sea level rise (0.5 m and 2.0 m by 2100) without adaptation.
  13: Sea-level rise of 0.5 m and 2.0 m by 2100.
Highlights:
  1: Sea-level rise could lead to forced displacement of a large number of people,
    which could be avoided by costly protection measures.
  10: Estimates the number of people displaced by sea-level rise and economic flood
    damages based on population density and GDP.
  11: The study models how coastal managers could respond to sea-level rise, exploring
    possible futures rather than computing an optimal adaptation policy. Different
    adaptation strategies influence impacts and adaptation costs.
  12: Impacts in some regions such as north and west Europe and the North America
    Atlantic Coast are much greater for a 2.0 m scenario than for a 0.5 m scenario
    because pre-existing defenses are overwhelmed.
  13: "East Asia, North America Atlantic, North America Paci\uFB01c, north and west\
    \ Europe and South America Atlantic are the \uFB01ve regions with the highest\
    \ costs."
Methodology:
  10: Uses the DIVA model to assess coastal erosion, flooding, and submergence, considering
    beach/shore nourishment and dike construction/upgrade as adaptation options. River
    flooding is evaluated along 115 major rivers. The present storm-surge characteristics
    are displaced upwards with the rising sea level, which implies no change to the
    intensity or frequency of coastal storms or interaction between sea level and
    tidal and surge characteristics.
  11: The DIVA model computes impacts both without and with adaptation, considering
    dike construction and beach nourishment as adaptation options. It uses a demand
    function for safety related to per capita income and population density for dike
    construction, and a cost-benefit analysis for beach nourishment based on tourism
    revenue from the Hamburg tourism model (HTM).
  12: DIVA model assuming no adaptation.
  13: The analysis assumes an existing adaptation infrastructure that can be upgraded.
More Notes:
  11: Maintenance costs of dikes, approximately 1% per annum of the capital stock,
    are considered as an offline calculation. A correction is applied for a 2m sea
    level rise scenario, where 25% of the developed coastal zone is abandoned if protection
    costs increase fourfold, based on results from the FUND model.
  12: Socioeconomic scenarios used assume no coastward migration, which could amplify
    impacts.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Potential cost of widespread coastal protection, expressed as a percentage of
    global domestic product.
  10: Economic flood damages based on population density and GDP are estimated.
  11: Avoided damages from sea-level rise are considered as a benefit of adaptation.
  12: Net population displaced due to sea level rise.
  13: Incremental adaptation costs (dike and nourishment) at a national level.
Quantitative material:
  1: Coastal protection cost up to 0.02% of global domestic product.
  10: The number of people displaced by sea-level rise can be estimated owing to a
    combination of erosion and increased flooding. Threshold return level to define
    abandonment set at a greater than 1 in 1 year frequency of flooding.
  12: "1.2\u20132.2 million people are displaced over the century in the Caribbean,\
    \ Indian Ocean and Paci\uFB01c Ocean small-island regions."
  13: "The number of displaced people falls dramatically with protection to comparatively\
    \ minor levels of 41 000\u2013305 000 people displaced over the twenty-\uFB01\
    rst century."
