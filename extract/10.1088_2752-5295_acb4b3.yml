Drivers of Risk:
  2: Sea-level rise (SLR) due to climate change is identified as the primary driver
    of risk for low-lying atoll nations.
  7: "Population density and urbanization pressures around Mal\xE9 are drivers of\
    \ risk."
  8: Sea Level Rise (SLR) and energetic swell wave conditions
  10: Sea level rise
  14: Sea Level Rise (SLR); Pluvial flooding risk increases with development and rising
    living standards.
  16: "Rising sea levels leading to necessary migration and island adaptation in 'Greater\
    \ Mal\xE9'."
  18: Sea level rise (SLR) and disasters like the Indian Ocean tsunami are identified
    as trigger mechanisms and tipping points that may necessitate adaptation and change.
  19: Sea level rise (SLR) and wave dynamics on reefs lead to saltwater flooding from
    overwash events, reducing the ability of aquifers to recover between events, thus
    leading to salinisation of groundwater; changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration,
    waves, and SLR affect groundwater volume and quality.
  20: Rising sea levels and climate impacts like rising sea temperatures and coral
    bleaching affect macroeconomic outcomes.
Highlights:
  2: Structural adaptation through land claim and island raising can sustain islands
    and land area above rising sea levels to meet societal and economic needs over
    centuries.
  10: Different island functions can support each other, often reinforcing current
    practice, following movement patterns established in Case I.
  14: "Managed migration between raised islands is proposed as a feasible adaptation\
    \ strategy for Greater Mal\xE9 to prosper under rising sea levels. Raising of\
    \ land is the only way to guarantee that coastal flooding will not occur with\
    \ SLR."
  16: Proposed adaptation pathway suggests cycles of island abandonment, raising,
    resettlement, and habitation to manage sea-level rise.
  18: Adaptation strategies need broad stakeholder support to develop and sustain
    effective pathways; social, governance, and ecological events are critical considerations.
  20: Adaptation financing needs to be suitable for both present and long-term conditions,
    considering changing conditions and needs.
Methodology:
  2: The paper uses an adaptation pathway approach, illustrated with the Maldives
    as a case study, focusing on land claim and island raising as structural adaptation
    measures.
  8: "The paper considers structural adaptation measures. Adaptation pathways are\
    \ developed for three urban islands in the Maldives (Mal\xE9, Hulhumal\xE9, and\
    \ a hypothetical higher island Abadhah-Mal\xE9) based on modeling flood risk conditions\
    \ considering the effects of SLR and potential flooding under energetic swell\
    \ wave events. Overtopping and flood extent were assessed using overtopping models\
    \ and a flood spread model under different SLR scenarios."
  10: Adaptation pathways are analysed per island for mitigation and non-mitigation
    SLR scenarios. A multi-island adaptation pathway was produced for the capital
    city region, including migration between islands. Islands are classified based
    on land use and function (agricultural, energy, heritage, natural, port, rural,
    tourism, and urban). The remaining six land use types were grouped into four classes
    and analysed in terms of engineering design conditions, space and material availability,
    cost-benefit conditions, social acceptability and economic productivity.
  14: Analysis involves overtopping and inundation analysis, island design based on
    cost, design life, and multi-metre SLR resistance, and adaptation pathway modeling
    involving island advance and raising, plus population migration. The model thresholds
    are determined from comparing land height and SLR, factoring in social thresholds
    like flood acceptability.
  16: Discussion of an adaptive approach involving island raising and planned migration
    in response to sea-level rise.
  18: The paper discusses an adaptation pathways approach which considers technical,
    policy, human, and financial/economic challenges in planning adaptation strategies.
More Notes:
  2: The paper acknowledges that while land advance/raising provides a technical solution,
    additional policy, human, physical, engineering, and economic/financial challenges
    need to be addressed.
  10: The paper focuses on land advance and raising, plus the associated movement
    of people.
  14: The adaptation strategy includes a cycle of abandoning and raising infrastructure,
    while the population moves to a new island. Tourist use is a major economic sector
    considered in the island design. Bridge links are advantageous in easing population
    movement.
  16: Focus is on adaptation strategies to counteract rising sea levels rather than
    direct economic effect analysis.
  18: Adaptation solutions in the Maldives are driven by local choice and must be
    balanced with pressing development needs; cultural factors significantly influence
    migration and adaptation strategies.
  19: The diagram (Figure 9) presents a conceptual framework for adaptation pathways,
    emphasizing the need for a balance between top-down national strategies and bottom-up
    local perspectives, coupled with risk control (including cost-benefit analysis)
    and acceptability considerations (including loss).
  20: Most of the discussed adaptation measures (e.g., land advance/raising) relate
    to island nations, particularly SIDS, and their economic development needs.

  9: This page focuses on adaptation options to sea-level rise (SLR) in the Maldives,
    specifically listing adaptation measures and their suitability at different SLR
    thresholds for three islands. It does not contain any quantitative macroeconomic
    or fiscal information, nor does it discuss economic costs or benefits of adaptation
    at a national level.
  21: This page primarily describes island adaptation strategies to climate change,
    such as land advance and raising, but it does not provide specific macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes, quantitative data, or methodologies relevant to a national-level
    analysis of adaptation costs and benefits. The information is descriptive and
    focuses on engineering and geographical aspects of adaptation measures in island
    settings.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: The paper discusses the potential for atoll nations to persist and prosper even
    with sea-level rise, presenting an alternative to forced migration and national
    abandonment.
  7: Urbanisation trends are leading to pressure for new land and/or higher buildings
    in the Maldives.
  8: Avoid flooding due to SLR and provide safe land for development
  10: No relevant information
  14: No relevant information
  16: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, such as GDP effects or public
    expenditure implications, are mentioned.
  18: No relevant information
  19: Reduced freshwater availability can lead to challenges on land for drinking
    water and the ability of agriculture and other day-to-day activities to survive;
    reliance on imported, desalinized and rainwater increases, potentially becoming
    commonplace even on less densely populated islands.
  20: Innovative funding and financing methods are needed to support adaptation, which
    could include levies on hotel stays, sand use, and international flights.
Quantitative material:
  7: "By 2050, about 475,000 people (or 52% of the national population) are expected\
    \ to live on Mal\xE9 and Hulhumal\xE9."
  10: No relevant information
  14: "Occasional flooding on Hulhumal\xE9 (Phase I) could commence with approximately\
    \ 0.6m of SLR. Dike protection on Hulhumal\xE9 could protect for up to 1.4m of\
    \ SLR. With 1m of SLR, Hulhumal\xE9 will be in a similar situation to Mal\xE9\
    \ today. With 1.8m of SLR, Hulhumal\xE9 may have to be abandoned. Abadhah-Mal\xE9\
    \ is raised to about 6m elevation."
