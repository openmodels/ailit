Drivers of Risk:
  1: Higher temperatures, daily temperature variability, extreme precipitation, extreme
    summer heat
  2: Fluctuations in average monthly temperatures and daily temperature variability.
  3: Temperature shocks (one-off increase in monthly average temperature), excess
    wet and dry conditions, daily precipitation extremes.
  4: Ongoing warming and intensification of weather extremes and variability due to
    anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
  5: Increasing average temperatures due to climate change under different emission
    scenarios (SSP126, SSP585).
  6: Increasing average temperatures, changes in the seasonality of temperature, unpredictable
    hot extremes (heatwaves)
  7: Extreme heat events (specifically the 2022 summer heatwave) and future climate
    change, as projected by CMIP-6 climate models under various Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSPs).
  8: Higher-than-normal temperatures; climate change altering inflation seasonality,
    increasing inflation volatility, inflation heterogeneity, and placing persistent
    pressures on inflation levels.
  9: Deviations of average temperature (d /C22T c;m), Deviations of temperature variability
    (d eT c;m), Relative exceedance of high precipitation thresholds (T x), Standardised
    Precipitation Evapotranspiration Indices (SPEI)
  10: Monthly weather shocks (temperature and precipitation deviations from normal
    seasonal conditions), specifically average temperature and Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration
    Index (SPEI)
  11: Future weather conditions under projected climate change, specifically changes
    in monthly average temperatures.
Highlights:
  1: Higher temperatures increase food and headline inflation persistently over 12
    months in both higher- and lower-income countries; Pressures are largest at low
    latitudes and show strong seasonality at high latitudes, peaking in summer.
  2: Temperature increases cause nonlinear, persistent increases in food and headline
    inflation. Impacts are strongest in the food price component. Increased daily
    temperature variability leads to significant upwards pressures on food and headline
    inflation.
  3: Temperature increases cause equivalent impacts on inflation in high- and low-income
    countries, suggesting limited historical adaptation. Excess wet conditions cause
    upwards impacts on food and headline prices which persist over twelve months.
    Statistically significant upwards pressures on headline inflation can be identified
    in hot months in the first month following a precipitation shock.
  4: Projected global warming would cause persistent upward exogenous pressures on
    inflation of considerable magnitudes already during the next few decades, independent
    of future emission trajectories. Decisive mitigation of greenhouse gases could
    substantially reduce inflationary pressures. Adaptation via adjustment could substantially
    reduce future impacts.
  5: Future warming causes alterations to the usual seasonal cycle of food inflation,
    resulting in an alteration of considerable size.
  6: "Future climate change will amplify the magnitude of heat extremes, thereby also\
    \ amplifying their potential impact on inflation. The analysis suggests that if\
    \ amplified by future warming, an equivalent extreme summer (i.e., in the upper\
    \ tail of the shifted temperature distribution) would \u2013 ceteris paribus -\
    \ amplify the impacts of heatwaves on inflation"
  7: Extreme heat events already occurring under present climatic conditions pose
    short-term risks to inflation, and these risks will be amplified by future warming,
    potentially by as much as 200% by 2060 under pessimistic emission scenarios.
  8: Climate change is likely to alter inflation seasonality, increase inflation volatility
    and heterogeneity, and place persistent upward pressures on inflation levels.
  9: The response of headline inflation differs considerably due to the inconsistent
    inclusion of imputed rents in headline inflation in the World Bank data. Significant
    effect of interaction of negative (excess dry) SPEI threshold exceedance with
    monthly average temperature level on inflation.
  10: Weather deviations from normal seasonal patterns impact month-on-month inflation
    rates. Accounting for linear time trends enhances the magnitude of estimated effects.
  11: The paper focuses on the impact of projected future warming on inflation. It
    assesses the impacts of the 2022 extreme summer heat in Europe on inflation. It
    evaluates how the impacts from such extremes could be amplified under future warming.
Methodology:
  1: Fixed-effects regressions applied to over 27,000 observations of monthly consumer
    price indices worldwide. Results applicable for temperature increases projected
    for 2035.
  2: Fixed-effects panel regression models using historical weather data and monthly
    price indices across 121 countries (1996-2021), accounting for country-specific
    time trends and seasonality.
  3: Fixed-effects panel regressions on over 27,000 observations of monthly price
    indices and weather fluctuations worldwide over the period 1996-2021. Robustness
    tests include dynamic panel specification, Driscoll-Kraay errors, and controls
    for monetary policy.
  4: Empirical evidence for the historical impacts of weather shocks on inflation,
    future climate conditions from an ensemble of 21 bias-adjusted climate models
    from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP-6) under different
    emission forcing scenarios from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP). Impacts
    are considered in the absence of unprecedented adaptation, without a targeted
    monetary policy response, and abstracting from any possible interactions with
    macroeconomic developments.
  5: The analysis uses projections from CMIP-6 climate models to estimate the pressure
    on inflation from average temperature conditions. It accounts only for increasing
    average temperatures using a baseline empirical specification. Estimates reflect
    the exogenous pressure on inflation arising from future weather conditions in
    the absence of historically un-precedented adaptation, policy response, and abstracting
    from any possible interactions with macroeconomic developments. The use of monthly
    CPI data allows for assessment of how the estimated pressures on inflation are
    distributed across the year.
  6: Empirical results are estimated using monthly temperatures. Future summer warming
    is projected using CMIP-6 models and added to historical temperatures to re-evaluate
    impacts using empirical response functions. Impacts are estimated accounting only
    for increasing average temperatures, and reflect exogenous pressures on inflation
    arising from future weather conditions in the absence of historically unprecedented
    adaptation or policy response.
  7: Empirical analysis using historical data on weather variables and inflation to
    identify relationships, then using climate model projections (CMIP-6) under different
    SSP scenarios to project future impacts on inflation.
  8: Empirical analysis using monthly inflation data from 121 countries (1996-2021)
    and temperature data. Results assume constancy in other factors.
  9: Fixed-effects panel regression models to identify the causal effects of changes
    in weather variables on national level inflation. Climate data from ERA-5 reanalysis
    and CRU TS v4.05. Period 1990-2021. Spatial aggregation using population weighted
    average.
  10: Panel regression analysis with country, date, and country-month fixed effects,
    and country-specific linear time trends. Includes 11 lags of weather variables
    to assess delayed effects. Robustness checks include dynamic models with lagged
    inflation, Driscoll-Kraay errors, and controls for monetary policy transitions.
    Climate model data (temperature and precipitation) from CMIP-6 models under SSP585
    and SSP126 scenarios from 2015-2100.
  11: Uses climate model projections (CMIP-6 ensemble) and emission scenarios (SSP585)
    to evaluate the impact of future warming on inflation. Employs a trend-preserving
    method developed by ISIMIP to downscale data. The methodology assumes that future
    warming will shift the mean of the distribution of possible summer temperatures.  The
    impacts are averaged over 30-year periods centered on future periods (usually
    2035 or 2060).  The study evaluates first terms pertaining to monthly average
    temperatures.
More Notes:
  1: Effects vary across seasons and regions depending on climatic norms
  2: The response to average temperature is strongly non-linear, such that increases
    in hotter months and regions cause larger inflationary impacts. Increases in average
    temperatures at high latitudes cause upwards inflationary pressures when occurring
    in the hottest month of the year, opposing downward pressures when occurring in
    colder months. By contrast, increases in average temperatures at lower latitudes
    cause upwards inflationary pressures all year round.
  3: The study considers temperature shocks defined both with respect to a static
    (1990-2021) and a moving (30-year average) baseline, finding similar results.
    The analysis also considers the impacts of daily precipitation extremes.
  4: Pressures on inflation from projected future temperature conditions are generally
    larger in the global south. Results assume other socioeconomic factors such as
    demographic developments and changes in the consumption basket remain constant.
  5: The seasonality of pressures on inflation from future warming varies across latitudes.
    There is spatial heterogeneity in the pressures on inflation, which is robust
    across empirical specifications. The impacts depend on baseline temperatures.
  6: The paper uses the GADM database for national administrative boundaries.
  7: The study acknowledges limitations in detecting impacts of precipitation changes
    on food prices due to the high spatial variability of precipitation and the use
    of national-level data.
  8: The inflationary impact of temperature shocks depends on baseline climatic conditions.
    Future climate change implies different warming levels depending on the season
    and latitude, implying that temperature shocks under future climate change would
    both amplify inflation heterogeneity and alter the seasonality of inflation within
    individual countries. Planned adaptation could limit heat stress impacts on labour
    productivity and crop switching could limit agricultural productivity losses,
    two major channels of impacts with potential relevance to inflation.
  11: The study acknowledges uncertainty in estimated impacts arising from the choice
    of empirical specification, the range of climate model projections, and future
    emission scenarios.

Quantitative material:
  1: Temperature increases projected for 2035 imply upwards pressures on food and
    headline inflation of 0.92-3.23 and 0.32-1.18 percentage-points per-year respectively
    on average globally; 2022 extreme summer heat increased food inflation in Europe
    by 0.43-0.93 percentage-points which warming projected for 2035 would amplify
    by 30-50%
  2: "A 1\xB0C increase in monthly temperature causes a cumulative effect on food\
    \ inflation of 0.17 percentage points over the following year (when occurring\
    \ in country-months with a temperature of 25\xB0C)."
  3: "A one-off 1\xB0C increase in monthly temperature has persistent impacts on food\
    \ and headline prices. The paper provides cumulative marginal effects of temperature\
    \ increases on month-on-month inflation rates, evaluated at different baseline\
    \ temperatures. Effects are presented as percentage point increases in inflation\
    \ rate over a lag of 0-9 months. Specific regression results are in Tables S2\
    \ & S3."
  4: "Persistent upwards pressures on food inflation of 1.49\xB10.45 or 1.79\xB10.54\
    \ percentage-points per year (p.p.p.y.) respectively in a best- (SSP126) or worst-case\
    \ (SSP585) emission scenario by 2035. Pressures on headline inflation are approximately\
    \ half as large, 0.76\xB10.23 or 0.91\xB10.28 p.p.p.y. under a best- or worst-case\
    \ emission scenario by 2035. Range of potential pressures on food inflation of\
    \ 0.92-3.23 p.p.p.y. by 2035, and of 0.32-1.18 p.p.p.y. for headline inflation,\
    \ on average across the world. By 2060, there is a strong and robust difference\
    \ in the average global pressures on food inflation between the highest and lowest\
    \ emission scenarios: 2.1 p.p.p.y. in our central estimate with a range of 1.6-3.8\
    \ across empirical specifications and climate models."

    price aggregates expected by 2035 under a high-emission scenario (SSP585); graphs
    showing the annual pressure on inflation aggregated across world regions (population
    weighted) at different time periods under both a low (SSP126) and high (SSP585)
    emission scenario for food and headline price aggregates.
  6: "The anomalous heat over Europe in June, July, and August of 2022 caused a cumulative\
    \ annual impact of 0.67 percentage-points (0.43\u20130.93) on food inflation and\
    \ 0.34 percentage-points (0.18\u20130.41) on headline inflation in Europe."
  7: "By 2060, the amplification of such extreme impacts would diverge under different\
    \ emission scenarios, remaining at 1.1 percentage-points (0.6\u20131.8) under\
    \ the most optimistic scenario compared to 1.8 percentage-points (1.0\u20133.2)\
    \ under the most pessimistic scenario of emission mitigation."
  8: Evaluating the regression coefficients pertaining to average temperatures at
    the baseline temperature observed across countries (23.5 C), and given a 1.5 C
    temperature increase, indicates an impact of 0.17%-points on monthly inflation.
    This translates to 0.49%-points quarterly increase.

    \ and months of a 1-unit increase in each independent variable on month-on-month\
    \ inflation rates, shown in Tables S2 and S3. Cumulative marginal effects (ME)\
    \ are calculated by summing lagged coefficients, reflecting the theoretical cumulative\
    \ impact on prices from a 1-unit climate shock (Eq. 4)."
