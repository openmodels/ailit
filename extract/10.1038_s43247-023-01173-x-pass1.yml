Highlights:
  1: Higher temperatures increase food and headline inflation persistently over 12
    months. Pressures are largest at low latitudes and show strong seasonality at
    high latitudes, peaking in summer. The 2022 extreme summer heat increased food
    inflation in Europe by 0.43-0.93 percentage-points which warming projected for
    2035 would amplify by 30-50%.
  2: Temperature increases cause nonlinear, persistent increases in food and headline
    inflation; these effects are stronger in hotter months and regions. Impacts are
    also derived from average temperature and daily temperature variability.
  3: Persistent impacts on food and headline prices from a one-off increase in monthly
    average temperature; Excess wet conditions cause upwards impacts on food and headline
    prices; Effects of temperature increases are consistent across both higher- and
    lower-income countries and when accounting for different historical inflation
    volatility; Limited historical adaptation to temperature increases.
  4: Projected global warming is expected to cause persistent upward exogenous pressures
    on inflation, with considerable magnitudes already during the next few decades.
    Pressures on inflation from projected temperature conditions are generally larger
    in the global south. Decisive mitigation of greenhouse gases could substantially
    reduce inflation pressures. Adaptation via adjustment to changing temperatures
    could substantially reduce future impacts.
  5: Projected temperature increases are typically stronger in winter than in summer
    in Northern mid-to-high latitudes (except Europe). Seasonality of inflation pressure
    is fairly constant across seasons at low latitudes but varies considerably across
    seasons in Northern mid-latitudes (20-40 N), where they can be more than twice
    as large in summer compared to winter. At the highest latitudes (>40 N) upwards
    pressure in summer contrasts downwards pressure in winter.
  6: Future climate change will amplify the magnitude of heat extremes, thereby amplifying
    their potential impact on inflation.  The seasonality of pressures on food inflation
    from average temperature conditions projected under future climate change varies
    across latitudinal bands and countries (US, Germany, Colombia, Kenya are specifically
    examined). Climate change may lead to amplification of seasonal variability in
    some regions (e.g., Southern USA) and reductions in others (e.g., most of Europe).
  7: By 2060, summer heat extremes could significantly amplify inflation impacts,
    up to nearly 200% under pessimistic climate scenarios, and affect food and headline
    inflation consistently across climate models.
  8: Climate change is likely to alter inflation seasonality, increase inflation volatility,
    inflation heterogeneity and place persistent pressures on inflation levels. The
    inflationary impact of temperature shocks depends on baseline climatic conditions.
    Future climate change implies different warming levels depending on the season
    and latitude, implying that temperature shocks under future climate change would
    both amplify inflation heterogeneity and alter the seasonality of inflation within
    individual countries. Upward pressures on annual food inflation of 1-3 percentage-points
    per-year could result from temperatures projected for 2035.
  9: The impact of deviations of monthly climate conditions from their historical
    seasonal patterns, following the intuition that the economy is well adapted to
    historical weather patterns from which deviations are a source of potential impacts.
  10: Accounting for linear time trends enhances the magnitude of estimated effects,
    suggesting it assists in removing estimation biases.
  11: Assesses the impacts of the 2022 extreme summer heat in Europe on inflation;
    evaluates how the impacts from such extremes could be amplified under future warming.
Methodology:
  1: Fixed-effects regressions applied to over 27,000 observations of monthly consumer
    price indices worldwide. Results are applicable under temperature increases projected
    for 2035.
  2: The analysis uses high-resolution data from the European Centre for Medium-range
    Weather Forecast Reanalysis combined with monthly price indices across 121 countries
    from 1996-2021, employing fixed-effects panel regression models to exploit within-country
    variation.
  3: Fixed-effects panel regressions over 27,000 observations of monthly price indices
    and weather fluctuations worldwide over the period 1996-2021; Analysis using SPEI
    (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index); Testing with national income
    splits and normalization by historical volatility; Comparison of fixed vs. moving
    baseline temperature shocks.
  4: The analysis uses empirical models based on historical impacts of weather shocks
    on inflation to assess the consequences of future climate conditions, using temperature
    projections from an ensemble of climate models. The results abstract from future
    adaptation, monetary policy responses, and interactions with macroeconomic developments.
    The results are applicable to assessing potential exogenous pressure on inflation
    from future climate conditions, assuming ceteris paribus.
  5: Uses CMIP-6 climate model projections and empirical specification to estimate
    the pressure on inflation from future temperature conditions. Analysis accounts
    only for increasing average temperatures using the baseline empirical specification.
    It abstracts from adaptation, policy response, and macroeconomic interactions.
    The study uses monthly CPI data. The time period is projections for 2025 and 2035.
  6: CMIP-6 climate model projections under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5) to
    project temperature conditions by 2035. Empirical response functions are used
    to assess the impact of altered summer temperature distributions. Historical data
    from 1996-2021 is used as a baseline. The future summer warming is added to the
    historical temperatures realised in 2022.
  7: The analysis uses CMIP-6 climate models to project future climate scenarios and
    their impact on inflation under different emission pathways, specifically for
    the years 2035 and 2060.
  8: Empirical models using monthly, non-seasonally adjusted prices at different levels
    of aggregation from 121 countries (1996-2021). Month-on-month inflation rates
    are used as the main dependent variable, estimated as the first difference in
    the logarithm of consumer price indices (CPI). The estimates are based on causal
    relationships inferred from the empirical models, in the absence of unprecedented
    adaptation, and should be understood as the likely exogenous pressure on inflation
    from future climate conditions.
  9: Fixed-effects panel regression models are used to identify the causal effects
    of changes in weather variables on national-level inflation. Climate data used
    included ERA-5 reanalysis of historical observations (daily 2m air temperature
    and surface precipitation rates for the years 1990-2021) and monthly average temperature
    for the months of June, July and August in 2022, along with CRU TS v4.05 data.
  10: Uses a dynamic panel regression model with country, date, and country-month
    fixed effects, as well as country-specific linear time trends. Includes lags of
    weather variables and inflation rates to assess delayed effects. Robustness tests
    include controls for monetary policy and various error structures.
  11: Uses empirical models to evaluate the impact of future weather conditions on
    inflation, bias-adjusted and statistically downscaled climate data (W5E5 dataset
    using the trend-preserving method developed by ISIMIP); future warming shifts
    the mean of the distribution of possible summer temperatures.
More Notes:
  2: The findings highlight the uneven impact of temperature changes across different
    latitudes and seasons, emphasizing the necessity to consider regional climatic
    and socio-economic variations.
  5: The heterogeneities in impact are from the dependence of the impacts on baseline
    temperatures rather than an explicit dependence on season or latitude. In Europe,
    more rapid warming in summer contributes to the seasonality of impacts.
  6: Estimates reflect exogenous pressure on inflation arising from future weather
    conditions in the absence of historically unprecedented adaptation or policy response.
  8: The paper considers adaptation via socio-economic development, prolonged exposure
    to higher temperatures, and adjustment to gradual warming, but finds that historical
    adaptation has been very limited. The estimates assume constancy in other factors
    which may be important for future developments of inflation such as general macroeconomic
    developments. Future adaptation to climate change through unprecedented technological
    changes offers an opportunity to limit pressures on inflation in a changing climate.
  9: SPEI is calculated at one, two-, three-, six- and twelve-month timescales to
    flexibly assess the impacts of shocks across these timescales.
  10: The study uses CMIP-6 climate model data under SSP585 and SSP126 scenarios from
    2015-2100 for temperature and precipitation.
  11: The analysis assumes fixed demographic developments, consumption basket changes,
    and fiscal/monetary policies. Uncertainty is assessed across empirical specifications
    and climate model projections.  Country-level impacts are aggregated to larger
    spatial regions using population-weighted averages, and binned averages across
    latitudinal zones are also used.

Quantitative Material:
  2: "A 1\xB0C increase in monthly temperature affects the price level over 12 months,\
    \ causing a cumulative effect on food inflation of 0.17 percentage points, particularly\
    \ noted when occurrences happen in country-months with an average temperature\
    \ of 25\xB0C."
Quantitative material:
  1: Temperature increases projected for 2035 implies upwards pressures on food and
    headline inflation of 0.92-3.23 and 0.32-1.18 percentage-points per-year respectively
    on average globally.
  3: "Cumulative marginal effects of a one-off 1\xB0C increase in monthly temperature\
    \ on month-on-month inflation rates; Statistically significant upwards pressures\
    \ on headline inflation can be identified in hot months in the first month following\
    \ the shock."
  4: "Projected increases in food inflation of 1.49\xB10.45 or 1.79\xB10.54 percentage-points\
    \ per year (p.p.p.y.) under best- (SSP126) or worst-case (SSP585) emission scenarios\
    \ by 2035. Headline inflation is projected to increase by approximately half as\
    \ much (0.76\xB10.23 or 0.91\xB10.28 p.p.p.y.). By 2060, the difference in average\
    \ global pressures on food inflation between the highest and lowest emission scenarios\
    \ is 2.1 p.p.p.y. (range 1.6-3.8)."
  5: Maps of pressure on annual national inflation in food and headline prices expected
    by 2035 under a high-emission scenario (SSP585). Annual pressure on inflation
    aggregated across world regions (population weighted) at different time periods
    under low (SSP126) and high (SSP585) emission scenarios for food and headline
    prices, with point estimates showing the average and error bars the standard deviation
    across climate models.
  6: "Estimated 0.67 percentage-points (0.43\u20130.93 across empirical speci\uFB01\
    cations) impact on food in\uFB02ation and 0.34 percentage-points (0.18\u20130.41)\
    \ on headline in\uFB02ation in Europe from the anomalous heat over June, July,\
    \ and August of 2022."
  7: The analysis provides quantitative changes in inflation due to heat extremes,
    with impacts on food inflation up to 1.0 percentage points and on headline inflation
    amplified by 30-50% in Europe by 2035 under different climate scenarios.
  8: A 1.5 C quarterly summer temperature increase leads to 0.38%-points impact on
    food inflation. Evaluating the regression coefficients pertaining to average temperatures
    at the baseline temperature of the three hottest months (23.5 C), a 1.5 C temperature
    increase indicates an impact of 0.17%-points on inflation. A temperature shock
    persisting across all three months of a quarter implies an impact of 0.49%-points.
  9: The combination of price and climate data results in 27,340 country-month observations
    across 121 countries.
  10: Provides cumulative marginal effects of climate shocks on prices, estimated
    by summing lagged coefficients.
  11: Estimates inflation impacts under different climate scenarios (SSP585 with 4.9
    C end-of-century global temperature change, NGFS hot-house world scenario with
    3.2 C, NGFS average with 1.7 C).
