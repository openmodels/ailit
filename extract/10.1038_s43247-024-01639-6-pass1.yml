Highlights:
  1: Climate suitability for dengue transmission has expanded in North America, East
    Asia, and the Mediterranean basin.
  2: Climate suitability models can define geographical limits of dengue transmission
    and capture intra-annual fluctuations in transmission potential. The study compares
    climate suitability to dengue incidence in Taiwan, Vietnam, Brazil, Colombia,
    Costa Rica, and Thailand.
  3: Global climate suitability for dengue virus transmission has increased, with
    significant changes observed in South America, Africa, and South Asia/Southeast
    Asia.
  4: Notable findings include increased climate suitability for dengue transmission
    across tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions, and estimation of high suitability
    in non-endemic areas like southern United States and northern Australia.
  5: A significant increase in population living in high-risk areas for dengue transmission
    from 1979-1983 to 2018-2022.
  6: "Equatorial tropical and subtropical zones experienced the largest increases\
    \ in climate suitability. Climate suitability expanded to more temperate environments\
    \ in North America, East Asia, and the Mediterranean Basin. Temperate climate\
    \ zones had the largest net change in climate suitability, increasing from 25.2%\
    \ to 30.5% (\u0394 = 5.3 pp, 90% CI = 3.2\u20136.2). The relative contribution\
    \ of population growth and climate change to dengue risk differs between the Global\
    \ South and Global North."
  7: Recent increases in global population living in high climate suitability areas
    for dengue are concentrated in the Global South, particularly in Asia and Africa.
    This growth contributes to elevated public health risks and calls for targeted
    vaccination efforts in these regions.
  9: The independent effects of changes in climate suitability and population size
    on the population living in areas with high dengue suitability were estimated.
  11: No relevant information
Methodology:
  1: Estimates of dengue transmission suitability are based on historical temperature
    and humidity data. The study examined how shifts in these climatic variables and
    human population growth contributed to changes in the geographical distribution
    and size of the global population living in areas with high climate suitability
    from 1979 to 2022.
  2: The analysis uses mechanistic and statistical approaches, including species distribution
    modeling, to estimate associations between climate variables and dengue or vector
    observations. It also uses accumulated experimental data on Aedes spp. mosquitoes
    to develop DENV suitability measures. The results are applicable from 1979 to
    2022 for climate suitability and vary by country for incidence data (e.g., 2000-2014
    for Brazil).
  3: The analysis uses a mechanistic measure called Index P, based on temperature
    and relative humidity, to estimate the climate suitability for dengue transmission
    from 1979 to 2022.
  4: "Analysis involves estimation of changes in climate suitability for dengue virus\
    \ transmission using thresholds applied to verify suitability changes from 1979\u2013\
    1983 to 2018\u20132022."
  5: Analysis used a censored linear regression model for dengue incidence based on
    climate suitability, and meta-analysis for results across countries.
  6: The study uses a dengue suitability measure incorporating the effects of temperature
    and relative humidity on mosquito-viral traits to evaluate changes in climate
    suitability for DENV transmission at a global scale between 1979-1983 and 2017-2022,
    stratified by population density, economic income group, and climate zone.
  7: The study examines climate suitability for dengue transmission using historical
    climate data from 1979 to 2022 and assesses population growth in these areas.
  8: The analysis uses a mechanistic climate-based dengue transmission model to estimate
    Index P, which is derived from relationships between DENV-Ae. aegypti traits and
    meteorological variables. The model incorporates climate-dependent and climate-independent
    parameters. The study uses monthly temperature and relative humidity data from
    1979-2022.
  9: Tobit models were used to quantify the relationship between Index P and DENV
    transmission for each country (Brazil, Colombia, Taiwan, Costa Rica, Thailand,
    and Vietnam), accounting for left-censoring of dengue incidence data. The seasonal
    Mann-Kendall test with Sen's slope was used to estimate long-term climate suitability
    trends from 1979 to 2022 using monthly Index P time series, with pre-whitening
    to reduce autocorrelation artifacts.

More Notes:
  1: In the Global South, the increase in population at risk was largely driven by
    population growth in areas with historically favorable climate suitability, while
    in the Global North, the increase occurred in previously unfavorable areas with
    limited population growth.
  6: Some regions in Northern and Eastern Africa were estimated to be decreasing in
    climate suitability.
  7: The study emphasizes the fulfillment of climate conditions as one of several
    criteria necessary for dengue transmission, suggesting that population and urbanization
    trends may be as influential as climate in shaping the spread of dengue.
  9: Index P threshold for high climate suitability for DENV transmission was set
    at 0.5.
