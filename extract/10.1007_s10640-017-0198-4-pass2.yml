Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature and humidity exposure due to climate change; socioeconomic development
    scenarios.
  3: Nonlinearity in energy demand responses to temperature extremes and spatial and
    temporal aggregation issues in climate projections.
  4: Variations in exposure to hot and cold, dry and humid days; ESM temperature projections;
    population and GDP growth; representative concentration pathways (RCPs) indicative
    of a high-warming no-policy scenario and moderate-warming mitigation policy scenario;
    shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenario of conventional economic development,
    slow population growth, international convergence, and rapid increases in final
    energy consumption.
  5: The response of energy demand to temperature changes, which varies by region
    and economic sector, impacts outcomes such as energy consumption.
  7: Exposure to vectors of intervals of temperature and humidity (ET and EH); agent's
    choices of space conditioning equipment, other energy-using capital, irrigation
    infrastructure, building characteristics (X); agent's consumption of energy (Q).
  8: Shocks or changes impacting the outcomes are changes in average temperature and
    humidity.
  9: Weather-sensitive final energy consumption
  10: Projected changes in meteorology due to climate warming, specifically temperature,
    are considered to impact energy demand.
  11: "Changes in frequency of hot days (mean temperature > 27.5\u25E6C) and cold\
    \ days (mean temperature < 0\u25E6C) at the grid-cell level."
  15: "Exposure to hot days (T > 27.5\xB0C) and cold days (T < 12.5\xB0C), high and\
    \ low extremes of specific humidity, long-run income growth"
  16: Temperature changes affecting long-run energy demand responses, leading to significant
    differences in energy consumption adjustments across regions.
  17: Changes in the frequency of hot and cold days due to climate change are the
    primary drivers of risk, impacting energy demand.
  19: Climate change, specifically changes in the frequency of cold and warm days.
    The prevailing energy source used across sectors and the projected expansion of
    their size. The SSP5 country per-capita GDP projections.
  20: Strong radiative forcing amplifies changes in energy consumption.
  21: Different warming scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) circa 2050
  22: Climate change (temperature changes), Socio-economic conditions (economic growth
    and sectoral shifts)
  24: Temperature change (warming scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), GDP, and the sensitivity
    of energy demand to temperature and GDP.

  26: Temperature (T) and Humidity (H)
  27: "Temperature changes (less than 12.5\xB0C and greater than 27.5\xB0C) impacting\
    \ energy demand and economic growth."
  28: Variations in temperature (tropical vs. temperate) appear to influence the economic
    variables.
  29: Climate change, specifically temperature and humidity increases, and socioeconomic
    development.

Highlights:
  1: Climate change will likely increase energy demand in South America, Asia, and
    Africa. Europe, North America and Oceania exhibit mixed responses, with reductions
    in the residential sector but potentially increases in commercial electricity
    use. The increase in energy demand disproportionately falls on low-and middle-income
    countries.
  3: Combining empirical estimates with climate projections requires careful aggregation
    of meteorological data to avoid understating impacts due to nonlinear demand responses
    to weather extremes.
  4: Develop a flexible methodology to characterize geographic variations in climate
    change impacts on energy demand across the globe. Long-run semi-elasticities capture
    the nonlinear effect of the climate on energy use indicative of adaptation responses
    by final consumers along the intensive as well as the extensive margins.
  5: The energy demand response exhibits a V-shaped function with distinct regional
    and sectoral sensitivities, impacting energy consumption elasticity.
  7: The agent's demand for energy is modeled as a function of temperature, humidity,
    capital, and past energy consumption, and is estimated using country-specific
    weather data.
  8: The model partitions the influence of meteorological covariates into short- and
    long-run effects on the energy demand.
  9: The study focuses on understanding the non-linear impact of weather variables
    on energy demand.
  11: The majority of grid cells will experience increased frequency of hot days and
    decreased frequency of cold days. The geographic incidence of these changes is
    uneven, with tropics experiencing more hot days and temperate regions experiencing
    fewer cold days.
  14: Energy demand response to temperature changes varies significantly across sectors
    (agriculture, commercial, industrial, residential), fuel types (electricity, fuel
    oil, natural gas), and climate zones (temperate, tropical). Some sectors and fuels
    show positive relationships with temperature changes (increased demand), while
    others show negative relationships.
  15: Cooling energy demand is entirely satisfied by electricity, while heating response
    is distributed among fuels or concentrated in fuel oil; Residential and commercial
    electricity demand are generally more responsive to real per capita GDP than industry
    and agriculture; Demand responses to heat and cold exposures are asymmetric
  16: Without climate change, global weather-sensitive energy demand is predicted
    to increase nearly five-fold by 2050, with electricity comprising a larger share
    of the energy mix.
  17: Emerging economies in the tropics are projected to experience a ninefold increase
    in final energy consumption, while advanced nations at high latitudes may see
    a quadrupling of energy demand. Nearly half of energy consumption is projected
    to be unaffected by climate change.
  19: Climate change impacts on energy demand are not uniform and depend on location
    (distance from equator), income level, fuel type, and sector. Developing countries
    in tropical regions are likely to experience increased energy demand. At the global
    level the impact of increased energy consumption due to climate change is regressive.
  20: Amplified by stronger radiative forcing, impacts on aggregate energy consumption
    are mostly negative in advanced countries and positive in developing nations.
  21: Energy demand changes vary significantly by sector and region under different
    warming scenarios. Industrial and total energy demand show the highest increases.
    Some regions may experience negative changes in agricultural energy demand.
  22: Climate change is expected to increase global energy demand, but this effect
    is of secondary importance compared with the effect of economic expansion; The
    impact of climate change on the current energy system is small (-1.2% to 2.2%
    or 2.5% to 3.8% change) but accounting for growth in the energy economy makes
    the impacts much larger.
  24: Uncertainty in responses is not additive and generates increases of 4.7-8.9%
    under moderate warming, and 7.5-19.3% under rapid warming. The upper bounds in
    Table 5.D may well understate the true uncertainty because temperature change
    relies on a single scenario of economic growth and projections of future temperature
    change from a single ESM.
  25: Dynamic modeling approach makes a difference to the elasticities used to project
    changes in energy consumption. First difference estimates substantially understate
    long-run results.
  26: The marginal effect of temperature and humidity on residential electricity consumption
    depends on the capital stock quantity. The heterogeneity in the marginal responses
    is small and centered around the estimates from the main model specification described
    in Section 2. Inclusion of household energy prices does not appreciably change
    the estimated temperature semi-elasticities, but it reduces the speed of adjustment
    toward long-run equilibrium.
  27: "There is a 13% increase in long-run energy consumption exposure to temperatures\
    \ over 27.5\xB0C, suggesting adaptation in temperate countries."
  28: Temperature conditions impact key economic variables, suggesting different economic
    impacts in tropical vs. temperate regions.
  29: Climate change impacts lead to a geographic and seasonal re-distribution of
    energy consumption towards tropical regions and towards summer months. Commercial
    and industrial activities in temperate and tropical regions, respectively, are
    identified as sectors where changes in socioeconomic and climatic conditions could
    significantly expand the use of electricity, leading to a net increase in energy
    demand.
  31: The paper establishes a methodology to address sectoral and regional differences
    in energy response and their interaction with temperature data.
  38: The table presents descriptive statistics of GDP and its sectors based on climate
    zone (Temperate and Tropical) and level of development across countries.
  39: "Humidity less than 4 g/kg (H < 4 g/kg) and temperatures greater than 27.5\xB0\
    C (T > 27.5\xB0C) show some statistically significant short-run and long-run impacts\
    \ on log real GDP per capita."
  40: Temperature and natural gas usage per capita appear to have statistically significant
    impacts on log real GDP per capita, with varying effects depending on temperature
    range and whether it is a short-run or long-run impact. The effects also appear
    to differ across regions (World, Temperate, Tropical).
  41: Temperature below 7.5 degrees Celsius has a statistically significant positive
    impact on log real GDP per capita in some regressions, both in the short and long
    run. Log fuel oil use per capita has a significant negative impact on log real
    GDP per capita in all models.
  42: Statistically significant effects (at the 5% or 10% level) of humidity and temperature
    on log real GDP per capita are observed across different sectors (electricity,
    fuel oil, natural gas) and regions (Temperate, Tropical, World). The sign and
    magnitude of these effects vary depending on the specific temperature/humidity
    range, sector, and region.
  43: Temperature and humidity extremes appear to have statistically significant effects
    on log real GDP per capita, although the direction and magnitude vary depending
    on the specific temperature/humidity range, sector, fuel type, and region. Some
    coefficients are positive and statistically significant while others are negative
    and statistically significant. The R-squared values vary across models, indicating
    different degrees of explanatory power.
  44: Temperature and humidity have significant impacts on real GDP per capita in
    both short and long run models.
  46: The most important outcomes are estimations of GDP effects from changes in electricity
    demand. The effects on GDP are expected to vary substantially by region. There
    appears to be a substantial increase in electricity demand sensitivity in some
    scenarios and regions (eg. Tropical) and a potential for substantial GDP growth
    with some sensitivity ranges going as high as '[38.84,175.38]'.

    with future scenarios of climate change and socioeconomic development. Applicable
    for characterizing climate impacts on energy demand at different spatial scales.
  3: The study adopts an approach that considers temporal exposure to different intervals
    of temperature to capture nonlinearity in energy demand responses, and discusses
    challenges in aligning empirical estimates with climate model projections due
    to aggregation.
  4: Econometrically disentangle the short- and long-run responses of per-capita energy
    consumption to variations in exposure to weather; combine these estimates with
    ESM temperature projections and consistent scenarios of population and GDP growth
    to elucidate potential climate change impacts on final energy consumption.
  5: The paper suggests developing an empirical model based on engineering and economic
    evidence regarding energy demand's sensitivity to temperature changes, differing
    by region and sector.
  6: Considers an intertemporally optimizing agent whose objective is to achieve a
    target equilibrium level of thermal performance.
  7: "The paper develops a model of agent's demand for energy, where performance (\u03C0\
    ) depends on weather exposure (ET, EH), capital (X), and energy consumption (q).\
    \ They use a partial adjustment model and derive an error-correcting form for\
    \ the agent's demand for energy (Equation 4), which is taken to the data. The\
    \ dependent variable is the logarithm of fuel \xD7 sector \xD7 country \xD7 year\
    \ demand for final energy per person. Covariates are the exposure (in days) to\
    \ intervals of average daily temperature and specific humidity."
  8: A cross-section-time series error-correction model is used to estimate the influence
    of temperature and humidity exposures on energy demand at the national level.
  9: Uses a balanced panel of 29-48 countries from 1978-2010, stratified by climatic
    regime (tropical or temperate based on Koeppen-Geiger classification). The dependent
    variable is weather-sensitive final energy consumption from the International
    Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Statistics and Balances. Meteorological covariates
    are derived from gridded 3-hourly fields of surface temperature and specific humidity
    from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) dataset and aggregated to
    daily averages.
  10: The paper employs the 'delta' method to compare ESM simulations of the current
    and future climate to minimize potential biases.
  11: The paper calculates the change in per capita energy demand at the grid-cell
    level by combining long-run climatic estimates with synthetic historical and future
    exposure series. It then aggregates these changes across grid cells, fuels, and
    sectors to estimate the net impact on contemporary country-level final energy
    demand.
  14: The paper estimates long-run semi-elasticities of per capita final energy consumption
    to daily temperature exposure.  Equations (13a), (13b), and (13c) provide formulas
    for calculating aggregate effects on fuel, sector, and total energy consumption
    at the country level.
  15: Aggregation of temperature bins to focus on hot and cold day exposures; Estimation
    of demand responses of fuels to heat and cold exposures and income elasticities
  16: The analysis uses empirical results and SSP5 projections of GDP growth to estimate
    future energy consumption and assess responses to weather shocks by fuel and sector.
  17: The analysis projects future energy consumption patterns and assesses their
    overlap with projected climatic changes, specifically focusing on changes in the
    frequency of hot and cold days. The time horizon extends to mid-century.
  19: Econometric estimates stratified by distance from the equator. Future potential
    change in the demand for energy is calculated using equations (13a)-(13c) considering
    projected fuel and sectoral mix. Grid cell-level shocks are distributed across
    countries at different income levels.
  21: The methodology appears to involve modeling or projecting energy demand changes
    under different warming scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) until circa 2050. The
    specifics of the model are not detailed on this page, but the analysis focuses
    on the G20 nations and other world regions.
  22: "Point projections constructed at the means of estimated responses to temperature\
    \ and income; Sensitivity analysis at the confidence bounds of parameter estimates,\
    \ assuming independence among fuel\xD7sector combinations, and between the responses\
    \ to temperature and to GDP."
  24: Sensitivity analysis performed on sectoral and aggregate energy demand responses
    under different warming scenarios around 2050.
  25: The study uses static, first-difference, and dynamic econometric models to estimate
    the relationship between temperature and energy consumption. They also use real
    per capita GDP as a proxy for capital stock.
  26: The model estimates the impact of changes in temperature and humidity, interacted
    with capital stock proxies (log of per capita GDP, log of aggregate country capital
    stocks, accumulated real imports of heating/cooling equipment, machinery, and
    transport equipment) on residential electricity consumption. The model includes
    country fixed effects, lagged values of dependent and independent variables, and
    controls for endogenously determined energy prices.
  27: Analysis involves long-run estimated semi-elasticities of energy demand in relation
    to temperature bins using proxy variables for capital stock.
  29: Cross section-time series regressions to estimate short-run and long-run elasticities
    of energy demand with respect to different temperature and humidity intervals,
    controlling for other confounding factors. Long-run elasticities are combined
    with scenarios of climate change and socio-economic development to project future
    energy consumptions.
  31: The analysis uses a methodology focusing on heterogeneity in demand response
    across sectors, fuels, and regions, interacting with varying temperature data.
  38: Descriptive statistics (Mean, Std, Max, Obs) are calculated for different climate
    zones (Temperate, Tropical) and developmental levels (Dev.Min) across countries.
    The statistics are based on a dataset of the. The unit of the economic variables
    is (2005 $).
  39: Panel regression analysis using first-differenced and lagged terms. Models are
    estimated for different regions (Temperate, Tropical, World) and sectors (Residential,
    Commercial, Industrial, Agriculture). Robust standard errors are used. Significance
    levels are indicated by * and **.
  40: Panel regression with short-run (first-differenced) and long-run (lagged) terms,
    controlling for region (World, Temperate, Tropical) and sector (Commercial, Residential).
    Robust standard errors are used. The regressions aim to determine the impact of
    temperature and natural gas usage on log real GDP per capita.
  41: 'Panel regression analysis using first-differenced and lagged terms. Robust
    standard errors are used. Significance levels: ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. The analysis
    is performed across different regions (Temperate, Tropical, World) and sectors
    (Industry, Agriculture, Residential).'
  42: Panel regression analysis (static model) with log real GDP per capita as the
    dependent variable, controlling for extreme temperature and humidity, electricity
    sector (Residential, Industry, Agriculture, Commercial) and type of fuel oil (Fuel
    oil, Natural Gas) and the Constant.
  43: 'First difference model, robustness check, regressions controlling for sector
    (Residential, Industry, Agriculture, Commercial), fuel type (Electricity, Fuel
    oil, Natural gas), and region (Temperate, Tropical, World). Significance levels
    are indicated as: ** p< 0.05, * p< 0.1'
  44: Analysis uses regression models to estimate short run (first differenced) and
    long run (lagged) effects across different climatic regions.
  46: The analysis appears to use elasticities to model the sensitivity of energy
    demand and GDP to temperature changes. There is mention of 'elasticities regions'
    and 'sensitivity' suggesting the use of regional and sectoral models.

More Notes:
  1: The study finds a regressive impact of climate change on energy demand.
  3: The study highlights the importance of accurately projecting temperature effects
    on energy demand and the challenges in aligning empirical and climate model data.
  5: The analysis focuses on understanding energy demand's temperature sensitivity
    across regions and sectors, highlighting the balance point temperature where demand
    shifts occur.
  7: The paper uses specific humidity as a measure because it is less correlated with
    temperature than relative humidity, even though relative humidity is a better
    indicator of the demand for cooling.
  9: The study seems to be focused on energy consumption and weather patterns, and
    their correlations. It appears to try and derive the impact of changes in climate
    on energy demand.
  11: The analysis assumes that sub-national per capita energy demand is uniformly
    distributed and equal to the national average. The study acknowledges that the
    future global energy system is likely to differ substantially from the present,
    which is a shortcoming of the approach.
  14: The table shows that the relationship between GDP and energy demand is highly
    variable across different sectors and fuel types. The data are provided for both
    Temperate and Tropical regions. The confidence intervals provided give an estimate
    of the significance of the elasticities.
  17: The distribution of energy consumption exposure to growth in high temperatures
    exhibits a long upper tail, with small quantities of energy use exposed to a wide
    range of percentage increases in heat (25% to more than 400%).
  19: The study uses RCP 8.5 and a moderate warming scenario to project future energy
    demand. The analysis differentiates between low, middle, and high-income countries
    based on per capita GDP thresholds ($9,750 and $29,000).
  21: The presented chart and accompanying details indicate that the study models
    future energy demand based on warming scenarios, but it does not directly quantify
    GDP, productivity, fiscal outcomes, or adaptation costs and benefits. It focuses
    solely on energy consumption changes.
  22: Tropical countries account for most of the increase in energy consumption above
    BaU levels, concentrated in the industrial and residential sectors. In temperate
    areas, the increase in commercial energy consumption is offset by declines in
    residential and industrial consumption.
  24: "Results highlight the long upper tail of impacts that arises purely from uncertainties\
    \ in energy consumption\u2019s responses to income and meteorology. Incorporating\
    \ additional GDP forecasts and multiple spatial fields of temperature change projected\
    \ by additional ESMs will almost surely broaden the envelope of uncertainty."
  25: The study finds an asymmetric response to temperature changes, with hot days
    increasing electricity consumption more in the residential sector in temperate
    regions and the commercial sector in the tropics. Natural gas consumption responds
    to cold days in temperate regions. Fuel oil consumption responds to cold days
    in both temperate and tropical regions.
  26: Energy price data is a limitation, especially for countries in the tropics.
    The paper uses lagged energy prices as covariates to address endogeneity.
  31: Future projections are based on one specific ESM and socioeconomic scenario,
    with potential expansions for future research.
  38: The page contains descriptive statistics for various GDP related variables based
    on temperature and humidity ranges, climate zones, and country development status.
    The table also lists energy consumption statistics.
  39: The dependent variable is electricity use. The analysis examines both short-run
    (first-differenced) and long-run (lagged) relationships.
  40: The analysis is performed at a national level, using data from 23 countries
    (or 7 in the Tropical region model). The sample size for the regressions is either
    552 or 168 observations.
  41: The models explain a small portion of the variance in log real GDP per capita,
    as indicated by the low R-squared values (0.044 to 0.130).
  42: The table presents a robustness check using a static model, indicating the results
    might be sensitive to model specification. The table does not provide information
    about policy choices on adaptation.
  43: The analysis is disaggregated by sector, fuel type, and region. The number of
    observations and countries included in each regression are reported.
  46: The formatting is somewhat chaotic which makes information extraction difficult.
    The notation of '[x,y]' presumably indicates the range of impact.

    (in %) for G20 nations and world regions under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
    Specific ranges for each sector are provided, e.g., Agriculture ranges from -40
    to 30, Industrial ranges from 0 to 150.
  22: "Under both warming scenarios there is a modest increase in global energy consumption,\
    \ by 6% and 11%, respectively; Changes in climate can be expected to increase\
    \ global demand for energy by 55EJ; hypothetical impact that an uncertain response\
    \ to a given change in the climate circa 2050 would have on today\u2019s energy\
    \ system -1.2% to 2.2% (2.5% to 3.8%) of current world energy consumption in the\
    \ RCP 4.5 (RCP 8.5) scenario."
  24: Provides ranges for sectoral and aggregate energy demand responses (in EJ) under
    different warming scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) and sensitivities to temperature
    and GDP elasticities. Specifically, the sensitivity analysis provides ranges for
    agriculture, commercial, industrial, residential, and total energy demand.
  25: The study uses semi-elasticities to quantify the impact of temperature on energy
    consumption. They compare short-run vs long-run responses in energy consumption
    to temperature changes.
  26: Long-run semi-elasticities are reported in Table 6 whereas full regression results
    are given in Table A7.
  27: Estimated semi-elasticities of energy demand to temperature changes, for both
    tropical and temperate countries, are provided.
  28: The plot includes quantitative values of up to approximately 0.015 for economic
    measures across different temperature categories.
  29: Global demand for air conditioning could expand by a factor 20 in 2050, even
    assuming a constant climate. Overall percentage increase in total final energy
    consumption is 26% in tropical regions and 0.19% in temperate regions. 15% reduction
    in residential sector and a 16% increase in the commercial sector in temperate
    regions
  38: Mean, Standard Deviation, Maximum, and Observations are provided for Real GDP,
    Total GDP, and GDP sectors (Agriculture, Commercial, Residential, Industry) for
    "Temperate" and "Tropical" climate zones.
  39: Regression coefficients, standard errors, R-squared values, and number of observations
    are provided for each variable and model.
  40: Regression coefficients for the impact of temperature ranges and natural gas
    use on log real GDP per capita are provided, along with standard errors and significance
    levels (p < 0.05, p < 0.1).
  41: Regression coefficients and standard errors for the impact of temperature ranges
    and fuel oil use on log real GDP per capita, R-squared values.
  42: Regression coefficients and standard errors for the effect of humidity and temperature
    variables on log real GDP per capita; R-squared values; Number of observations
    and countries.
  43: Regression coefficients and robust standard errors (in parentheses) quantifying
    the relationship between Log real GDP per capita and temperature/humidity variables.
  44: Short run and long run regression coefficients are provided for log real GDP
    per capita, humidity, and temperature indicators, showing statistically significant
    effects.
  46: Provides ranges of percentage changes in energy demand (total and by sector)
    and GDP effects for different fuels under various warming scenarios, mostly projected
    to circa 2050. Examples include '[0.32,2.40]' for total energy demand's impact
    on GDP under one scenario, and '[-0.01,0.00]' for oil fuel demand under another.
    Ranges of sectoral sensitivity are provided. Some ranges are very wide.
  47: Ranges of energy elasticities under different RCP scenarios and temperature
    sensitivities, but not directly linked to specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
