  2: No relevant information
  4: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  4: Drought events in the Pearl River Basin
  9: Intensity and frequency of extreme climate events are ever-increasing as global
    climate changes; terrestrial water storage lower than historical average.
Highlights:
  4: WSDI correlates well with SPI-6, SPI-12, SPEI-6, SPEI-12, SRI-3, SRI-6, SRI-12,
    and scPDSI. scPDSI has the highest correlation with WSDI. The Pearl River Water
    Resources Commission's records of drought are consistent with what is captured
    by the WSDI.
  9: GRACE data can be used to capture the occurrence, development, and disappearance
    of drought events, along with their characteristics; WSDI is a suitable tool for
    monitoring and evaluating large-scale hydrological drought.
Methodology:
  4: Compares the WSDI with SPI, SPEI, SRI, and scPDSI to assess its effectiveness
    in drought monitoring in the Pearl River Basin. Correlation analysis using Pearson
    correlation coefficient is performed between WSDI and other drought indices from
    April 2002 to December 2015.
  9: Uses GRACE satellite data to calculate Water Storage Deficit Index (WSDI) to
    monitor drought in the Pearl River Basin from April 2002 to June 2017. Compares
    WSDI with other drought indexes (SPI, SPEI, SRI, scPDSI) and actual drought situation
    records.
More Notes:
  4: The study focuses on drought monitoring and does not directly address macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal outcomes. The drought severity values are given for specific dates
    within the time span of each drought event.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  4: No relevant information
  9: Drought impacts water resources, natural ecological environment, agricultural
    production, and social and economic development.
Quantitative material:
  4: Table 2 lists drought events in the Pearl River Basin monitored by the WSDI,
    including time span, duration (months), intensity, category, severity, and drought
    order. Table 3 shows correlation coefficients between WSDI and other drought indexes
    (SPI-3, SPI-6, SPI-12, SPEI-3, SPEI-6, SPEI-12, SRI-3, SRI-6, SRI-12, scPDSI).
  9: Pearson correlation coefficient between WSDI and scPDSI is 0.803 (P<0.05).
