Drivers of Risk:
  2: Flooding events (specifically Hurricane Sandy), flood insurance (NFIP participation),
    and community risk perception.
  3: Rising sea levels, expanding flood plains, and perceptions of future flood risk
    are impacting housing values.
  4: The drivers of risk include storm surge, riverine flooding, and pluvial flooding,
    with specific mentions of spring precipitation on snow, heavy tropical storms,
    and Nor'easter cyclones. Annual maximum daily precipitation and storm surge heights
    are also considered.
  5: Surge- and rainfall-driven flooding events are the primary drivers impacting
    perceptions of flooding, housing density and housing prices.
  6: Flooding events (Hurricane Sandy, Tropical Storm Lee, minor flood events in the
    1980s and 1990s) impact housing prices. Community perceptions of flood risk influence
    responses.
  7: Flooding events are identified as drivers of risk to housing prices.
  8: Flooding losses, actual changes to flood hazards, and perceived risks.
  9: Precipitation and storm surge flood hazard.
  10: Changing seasonality of annual maximum floods over the conterminous US, as noted
    by Basu et al. 2023.
Evaluation overview:
  2: Home values and economic recovery for communities after flooding.
  3: Impact on home values and recovery from flooding events, particularly in coastal
    communities affected by Hurricane Sandy.
  4: This study evaluates economic losses from flooding, population density changes,
    community flood awareness, and flood preparedness.
  5: Evaluates simulated perceptions of flooding, housing density, and Housing Prices
    (HPs) against observed data.
  6: Housing prices (HPs) and perceptions of flooding risk are evaluated.
  7: Housing prices in coastal communities are being evaluated.
  8: Evaluates the impact of flooding and NFIP participation on housing prices (HP).
  9: Impact of floods on future house prices (HPs) and subsequent flood loss estimates.
Highlights:
  2: The initial economic impact of Hurricane Sandy was largely absorbed by the National
    Flood Insurance Program (NFIP); however, the region then exhibited a long-term
    decline in home values. Tracts with greater post-flood change in active insurance
    policies exhibited larger decreases in mean home values.
  3: Community perceptions of flood risk drive changes in coastal housing prices more
    than actual hazard regimes, and home values initially decrease after flooding
    events then recover over time.
  4: The SE model simulates how flood hazards lead to economic losses and changes
    in community awareness and preparedness. The model has been shown to accurately
    simulate human-flood dynamics.
  5: The study modifies a System Dynamics model to better simulate flooding impacts
    and includes approaches to simulate temporal changes in housing prices due to
    flooding impacts (sigmoid, ITS, and K-shaped recovery).
  6: The ITS model provided the most accurate representation of flooding dynamics.
    After Hurricane Sandy, HPs continued to rise, but more gradually than in the preceding
    30 years; there was a clear drop in relative HPs.
  7: The SE model developed in this research suggests that the immediate negative
    consequences of an isolated intense flooding event may continue to be absorbed
    by NFIP.
  8: Increases in NFIP participation across the study region drove short-term perceptions
    of increased risk, which then steadily drove down housing values over the next
    decade; housing values in the region were driven more by perceptions and NFIP
    participation than actual changes to flood hazards.
  9: The ITS recovery model best captured flooding dynamics in the study region. Simulating
    flood impacts on HPs significantly improved the simulations of both HPs and community
    awareness. Census tracts with greater change in insurance uptake following floods
    witnessed larger decreases in mean home values compared to those with more stable
    NFIP participation.
Methodology:
  2: Used a socio-environmental (SE) model and an interrupted time series model to
    study the temporal impacts of flooding on housing values.
  3: The study uses a socio-environmental (SE) model applied to 496 census tracts
    in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut, focusing on community perceptions of
    flooding and home values.
  4: The study uses a System Dynamics (SE) model to simulate annual economic losses,
    population density, community flood awareness, and flood preparedness based on
    a time series of peak annual flood hazards from 1970-2021.
  5: "A System Dynamics (SD) model is modified to separate surge- and rainfall-driven\
    \ flooding effects. The model is further adapted to include sigmoid, interrupted\
    \ time series (ITS), and K-shaped recovery models for simulating temporal changes\
    \ in Housing Prices due to flooding. The model is calibrated for each census tract\
    \ individually using data from 1970\u20132021."
  6: Housing models are integrated into a SE model to explore relationships between
    housing market values, external flooding hazards, and perceptions of future risk.
    The models are calibrated to observed NFIP claims, policies, population density,
    and mean HPs. Calibration was performed with calibrated ITS model parameter values
    across 496 census tracts.
  7: 'Three models are used to simulate housing prices: a sigmoid recovery model,
    an interrupted time series (ITS) model, and a K-shaped recovery model. The SE
    model developed in this research suggests that the immediate negative consequences
    of an isolated intense flooding event may continue to be absorbed by NFIP.'
  8: Uses a calibrated SE (Systematic Examination?) model and correlation plots to
    analyze the relationships between various parameters (flood awareness, NFIP participation,
    and housing prices) across census tracts in the study region (New Jersey, New
    York, Connecticut).
  9: Developed a socio-economic (SE) model to predict time-varying HPs, incorporating
    flood hazards and four HP response scenarios (no impact, sigmoid recovery, ITS
    recovery, K-shaped recovery). The ITS recovery model best captured flooding dynamics
    in the study region.
  10: The use of real-time evidence from the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season to study
    hurricane risk perception, as mentioned by Meyer et al. 2014.
More Notes:
  2: The study suggests that the salience of past flooding events and NFIP participation
    may be important regional drivers of housing prices.
  3: The study links changes in housing prices to community-scale perceptions of risk
    following Hurricane Sandy.
  5: The study uses the number of active NFIP policies as a proxy for flood awareness.
  6: State-level variations in the relationships between model parameters describing
    flood risk perceptions and HP dynamics are evident, driven largely by NY. Relationships
    are examined between community perceptions and responses to floods and parameters
    describing changes in housing values.
  7: The study region is coastal communities. The paper studies SE systems with tools
    that consider how processes interact.
  8: Variations in correlations across the states may be due to differences in social
    vulnerability or the number of census tracts considered from each state.
  9: The model incorporates feedbacks between flood insurance uptake and home values.
    Trade-offs were observed between accurate house price simulation and accurate
    loss simulation, suggesting the model doesn't simultaneously reproduce all aspects
    of the housing and NFIP system perfectly.

    Connecticut, and New Jersey from 1970 to 2021.
  4: The average annual maximum daily precipitation was 7.4 cm/day with nine events
    exceeding 10 cm/day from 1970-2021. The mean high tide at the Battery, NY is 0.76

    surge of 1.57 m MSL, with three events exceeding 2 m MSL. From 1979 to 2021, the
    average annual number of flood insurance claims submitted through NFIP in this
    region was 3,476 claims/year with an average annual claim total of $112 million.

  9: Immediate impact of 2012 Hurricane Sandy on the housing market was largely absorbed
    by the NFIP, but the region experienced a sustained decline in housing values
    afterwards.
