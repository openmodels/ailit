  6: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  2: Flooding events (specifically Hurricane Sandy), changes in flood hazard magnitude
    and seasonality due to climate change, and community risk perception shape housing
    prices.
  3: Rising sea levels, expanding flood plains, flooding hazards, perceptions of future
    flood risk, Hurricane Sandy, flood insurance premiums.
  4: Peak annual flood hazards (high surge elevations, extreme rainfall (W) above
    some threshold (T)) are the primary drivers of economic losses.
  6: Flooding events (specifically Hurricane Sandy), and community perceptions of
    flood risk (anxiousness, forgetfulness, preparedness, and decay of precautionary
    measures).
  7: Changes to the flooding regime, more frequent flooding, intense rainfall interspersed
    with extended droughts, coastal storm surge.
  8: Flood losses, perceived flood risk, and participation in the National Flood Insurance
    Program (NFIP) are drivers affecting housing market values.
  9: Floods, community perceptions (memory of past flooding and participation in NFIP),
    and insurance uptake following floods are drivers of risk for housing prices.
Highlights:
  2: The initial economic impact of Hurricane Sandy was largely absorbed by the National
    Flood Insurance Program (NFIP); however, the region then exhibited a long-term
    decline in home values.
  3: Home values are impacted by past exposures to flooding and perceptions of future
    risk. Post-Sandy price discounting of both flooded and non-impacted properties
    suggests perceptions of risk shape home value recovery. HP changes observed across
    the region could be attributed to community-scale perceptions of risk.
  4: The SE model simulates human-flood dynamics and their economic consequences at
    a community level, linking flood hazards to economic losses.
  6: Hurricane Sandy had a lower immediate impact on housing values than might have
    been expected, but there was a clear drop in relative HPs and slow decline after
    the event. Relationships between community perceptions of flood risk and housing
    price dynamics vary regionally, particularly driven by NY, NJ and CT.
  7: Coastal communities remain highly vulnerable to flooding under climate change.
    The SE model suggests that the immediate negative consequences of an isolated
    intense flooding event may continue to be absorbed by the NFIP; however, predicted
    changes to the flooding regime may result in sustained decreases in property values.
  8: NFIP participation appears to have shielded the housing market from immediate
    economic loss but may have unintentionally conditioned housing values on perceived
    risks. Regional perceptions of risk can be decoupled from actual risk.
  9: Simulating flood impacts on housing prices significantly improved the simulations
    of both housing prices and community awareness. Census tracts with greater change
    in insurance uptake following floods witnessed larger decreases in mean home values
    compared to those with more stable NFIP participation.
Methodology:
  2: A socio-environmental (SE) model and interrupted time series model were used
    to study the temporal impact of flooding on mean housing values.
  3: Socio-environmental (SE) models are used to map relationships between flooding
    hazards, community perceptions of flooding, community actions, and economic losses.
    Study focuses on coastal communities in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut,
    US, using 496 census tracts. Calibrates SE model to SE datasets to estimate community
    flood perceptions, validated with socioeconomic datasets (population density,
    flood insurance claims/policies, HP estimates). Evaluates competing models of
    the relationship between flooding loss, community perception, and mean house value.
  4: A System Dynamics (SE) model is used to simulate the relationships between housing
    price (HP) dynamics, community awareness of flooding, annual economic losses (L),
    population density (D), community flood awareness (A), and flood preparedness
    (P).
  6: The analysis integrates housing models into a socio-economic model and calibrates
    it using observed NFIP claims, policies, population density, and mean HPs. It
    then examines relationships between calibrated model parameters describing community
    perceptions/responses and changes in housing values using Spearman's rank correlation.
    The analysis is applicable to the study region which experienced a steady increase
    in HPs from 1970 to 2012.
  7: The study uses a Socio-Ecological (SE) model and examines different recovery
    models (sigmoid, ITS, K-shaped) to analyze the relationship between housing values
    and community perceptions of flooding.
  8: A spatially explicit (SE) model is calibrated using census tract data to analyze
    the relationships between flood awareness, NFIP participation, and housing market
    values. The analysis uses correlation plots to examine the relationships between
    model parameters. The results are applicable to the study region, and potentially
    indicative of short-term vs long-term risk perception.
  9: 'Developed a Socio-Economic (SE) model to assess the impact of floods on future
    housing prices, which then feedbacks to the estimate of future flood loss. The
    model incorporates both precipitation and storm surge flood hazard and includes
    four housing price response scenarios: no impact, sigmoid recovery, ITS recovery,
    and K-shaped recovery. The ITS recovery model best captured flooding dynamics
    in the study region.'
More Notes:
  2: Tracts with greater post-flood change in active insurance policies exhibited
    larger decreases in mean home values than those with more stable NFIP participation.
  3: The study aims to understand if HP changes after Hurricane Sandy can be attributed
    to community-scale perception of risk in coastal communities in New York, New
    Jersey, and Connecticut.
  4: The model considers the interplay between flood events, housing density, community
    awareness, and preparedness, which influence the economic impact of flooding.
  6: The paper suggests that NFIP may have limited the exposure of residents to economic
    losses related to flooding.
  7: The research suggests a complex interplay between flood risk, community exposure,
    resilience, perceptions of flooding, and governance.
  8: Social vulnerability influences NFIP participation. Differences in correlations
    across states may be due to variations in social vulnerability or the number of
    census tracts considered from each state.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Home values are affected by flooding, flood insurance, and community risk perception,
    which can have lasting impacts on national and global financial systems.
  3: Home values, housing prices (HPs), property values, economic losses (e.g., damage
    to structures and property)
  4: Annual economic losses (L) are simulated based on flood hazards, housing density,
    and a hazard to loss ratio.
  6: Housing prices (HPs) as a measure of economic costs and benefits related to flooding.
    The paper explores the impact of flooding on housing market values.
  7: Property values and economic loss due to flooding.
  8: Housing market values are affected by flood risk and NFIP participation.
  9: Housing prices (HPs) and NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program) losses are key
    outcomes.
Quantitative material:
  2: The modeling exercise studied the temporal impacts of flooding on mean housing
    values across 496 coastal census tracts of New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey,
    US, from 1970 to 2021.
  4: "From 1979 to 2021, the average annual number of flood insurance claims submitted\
    \ through NFIP in this region was 3,476 claims year\u22121 with an average annual\
    \ claim total of $112 million. Historical NFIP flood losses were highest with\
    \ 75247 claims in 2012, due to rainfall and storm surge from Hurricane Sandy."
  6: The paper uses model parameters b2 and b3 to quantify the initial drop in housing
    prices due to flooding and the rate of housing price recovery, respectively. It
    also uses Spearman's rank correlation to compare these parameters with those describing
    community perceptions and responses to floods.
  7: The SE model suggests that the immediate negative consequences of an isolated
    intense flooding event may continue to be absorbed by the National Flood Insurance
    Program (NFIP).
  8: "Correlations between calibrated SE model parameters (b2, b3, qA, qR, \u03BC\
    P, \u03BCR) are presented in a correlation plot."
  9: Immediate impact of Hurricane Sandy was largely absorbed by the NFIP; region
    experienced a sustained decline in housing values afterwards. Observed trade-offs
    between KGEHP (housing prices) and loss (KGEL), indicating difficulty in simultaneously
    reproducing all aspects of the housing and NFIP system.
