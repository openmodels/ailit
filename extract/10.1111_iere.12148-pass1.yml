Drivers of Risk:
  2: Uncertainty regarding future climate conditions (productivity shocks), irreversibility
    of infrastructure investments.
  3: Changing weather conditions, scientific uncertainty regarding future climate
    conditions, and the increasing likelihood of very large catastrophic events.
  5: Extreme temperatures affecting infrastructure (roads, energy plants, distribution
    networks), increased demand peaks on energy grids during extreme temperatures,
    rapid urbanization concentrating investments and services, less efficient energy
    sources, incident threats to water management systems.

    (specifically regarding climate change).

Highlights:
  2: Climate change uncertainty exacerbates agency costs in infrastructure projects.
    Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) may be less relevant in a warming world due
    to these increased agency costs.
  3: Long-term contracting is plagued with new agency costs of delegated flexibility
    that may be better controlled when parties wait until uncertainty on climate conditions
    is resolved. Offers a pessimistic view on the benefit of PPPs in the context of
    climate change.
  5: The model incorporates an irreversibility constraint linking effort (investment)
    at different points in time, where second-period effort cannot be lower than first-period
    effort in infrastructure projects.
  6: Uncertainty on climate changes makes it impossible to write long-term contracts
    conditional on future climate contingencies, exacerbating the agency problem between
    the public sector and the private sector due to the firm's incentives to underinvest
    in the earlier period to maintain flexibility for the future; This impacts incentive
    schemes through a Commitment Effect and a Flexibility Effect.
  7: Commitment to unbundle project stages between firms can prevent perverse incentives
    for flexibility; short-term contracting can shift flexibility motives to the principal
    and reduce agency costs; adopting a more costly but more flexible technology may
    be optimal in the face of environmental shocks, suggesting a substitutability
    between contractual and technological choices.

  9: The first-period effort affects the second-period production function through
    an irreversibility constraint e2 >= e1, implying that a minimum follow-up level
    of investment/maintenance is required once an infrastructure of a given size has
    been set up.
  17: With stationary contracts, the environment behaves as if it were stationary
    with an 'average' effort supply.
  25: "Investing more ex ante in technologies that are less exposed to climate hazards\
    \ ensures that random productivity shocks will be closer to the mean scenario.\
    \ The firm chooses less flexibility as \u03B1 increases, meaning that as the cost\
    \ of technology increases, the flexibility or adaptability of the technology decreases."
  27: Climate-related uncertainties may lead to a shift towards decreasing incentives
    in PPP contracts, particularly in water and energy production sectors; there may
    be a shift towards shorter contracts with lower-powered incentives schemes, and
    a lower propensity to divest assets in the long run; bundling of PPPs may not
    be welfare-improving in a context of growing climate-related uncertainties.
  29: Climate hazards can impact growth not only directly but also by affecting contracts
    and investments in infrastructure; the full consequences of this channel remain
    to be studied.

Methodology:
  2: Principal-agent model with dynamic moral hazard, limited liability, and irreversibility
    constraints.
  3: Uses a model of long-term contracting tailored to climate change to analyze the
    suitability of the standard PPP model.
  5: A two-period dynamic agency model between a public authority and a firm for public
    service provision, with dynamic moral hazard and uncertainty on climate change.
  6: Agency model with a principal (public sector) and agent (private sector) investing
    in infrastructure across two periods, considering contractual incompleteness and
    the agent's incentive to underinvest in the first period to maintain flexibility.
  7: Theoretical model of incentives and contracting; analysis of organizational and
    technological choices.
  8: 'Analysis is based on a public-private partnership contract model with two stages:
    an initial investment and a follow-up period.'
  9: The model uses a two-period principal-agent framework with an irreversibility
    constraint and uncertainty on climate shocks to analyze investment and maintenance
    decisions related to infrastructure.

    optimization of principal's intertemporal payoff
  25: "The analysis uses a model with a continuum of potential technologies indexed\
    \ by \u03B1, representing the level of exposure to a productivity shock \u03B8\
    . It examines the choice of technology in the context of long-lived infrastructure\
    \ projects, focusing on the trade-off between ex-ante costs and the impact of\
    \ climate shocks on productivity. The model assumes that a less costly technology\
    \ exacerbates the impact of climate shocks. It is applicable when considering\
    \ long-term infrastructure projects and the design choices that can reduce climate\
    \ change exposure."

More Notes:
  2: The analysis focuses on infrastructure sectors sensitive to changing weather
    conditions. The paper examines how to design concession contracts and organizational
    forms to control the cost of delegated flexibility under climate uncertainty.
  5: The relationship between infrastructure investors (often private) and public
    decision-makers affects the complex technological evolution needed for climate
    change adaptation.
  6: The paper focuses on how climate uncertainty and irreversibility affect public-private
    partnerships in infrastructure projects, particularly regarding the incentives
    for private firms to underinvest to retain flexibility.
  7: The paper focuses on the agency costs of delegated flexibility and how contractual
    and technological choices can mitigate these costs in the face of environmental
    uncertainty. It does not directly quantify macroeconomic or macro-fiscal impacts
    but explores the microeconomic foundations of such impacts by examining the incentives
    of firms and individuals in a dynamic environment.

  18: This page presents a theoretical model analyzing the impact of commitment and
    flexibility on optimal reward allocation in a dynamic setting. While the model
    itself does not directly address climate change adaptation or specific macroeconomic/fiscal
    outcomes, the concepts of commitment and flexibility could be relevant to understanding
    how governments should design adaptation policies in the face of uncertainty and
    long-term risks. The model analyzes how the optimal reward changes based on the
    responsiveness of an agent to the reward, which might be a useful abstraction
    for modeling private sector adaptation decisions in response to policy incentives.
  20: This page presents a theoretical model of contracting, potentially relevant
    to adaptation projects structured as PPPs. It explores how the structure of incentives
    within long-term contracts can affect investment and flexibility in response to
    changing circumstances. The relevance to national-level macroeconomic and macro-fiscal
    outcomes is indirect; the authors are looking at the incentives and risks of different
    forms of long term contracts.
  27: The paper discusses the trade-off between commitment and flexibility in PPP
    contracts in the context of climate change. Water and sanitation networks and
    power production projects require high flexibility due to their exposure to climate
    hazards. The recent trend away from PPPs in water management may indicate governments
    are avoiding contracts that induce growing rents to private operators. Technological
    improvements can offset the negative impact of climate uncertainties on PPPs.
