    and heat waves.
  5: Dry spells, heat waves, drought, aridity
  6: Dry spells (number of abnormally dry days preceded by at least j-1 others).
  10: Exposure to water stress, heat stress, heat wave days, dry spell days, drought
    level, aridity index.
  11: Exposure to dry spells, aridity index (background water stress), and SPEI (Standardized
    Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index, indicating drier/wetter years).
  12: Exposure to dry spells, heat waves, and drought.
  13: Dry spells (DSit), heat waves (HWit), drought, and aridity.

    waves, aridity
  20: Dry spells, national aridity, national drought levels, area equipped for irrigation
  21: "Dry spell days, annual water deficits (SPEI \u2264 0), aridity (aridity index\
    \ \u2264 0.65)"
  26: Temperature shocks
  29: Heat waves, Climate Change
  31: Climate extremes and irrigation; Dry spell frequencies and their variability;
    Global warming; Heat waves, drought and water excess; High temperature and drought
    stress
  35: "Dry spell exposure (28+ day dry spells), Drought (SPEI \u2264 0), Aridity (Aridity\
    \ Index below median)"
  36: Dry spells, heat waves, drought (SPEI), mean temperature, and total precipitation.
  37: Dry spell days and heat wave days (of varying minimum durations, 3+ to 12+ days)
    are the drivers of risk considered.
  38: Dry spell days (28+ days) with heat waves (9+ days).
  39: Dry spell days (DS), Heat waves (HW), and other climate variables (D, which
    may represent drought conditions)
  40: Dry spell exposure (DS), heatwave exposure (HW), and drought (D).
  41: Additional dry spell day, minimum duration of dry spells, minimum duration of
    heat waves
  42: The main driver of risk examined is the number of dry spell days, with varying
    lags.
  43: Dry spell day (minimum duration of 28 days) and heat wave duration (minimum
    duration of 9 days)
  46: Dry spells, aridity, drought (measured by SPEI)
Highlights:
  2: 4-5 week dry spells during the hottest part of the year depress growth in crop
    production; the effects are modified by existing drought, aridity, and heat waves;
    losses in yields are concentrated in areas not equipped for irrigation.
  5: Dry spells should lower growth in crop production, with effects that are larger
    in magnitude when dry spells co-occur with heat waves, drought, or aridity.
  10: Exposure to dry spells, heat waves, and drought conditions is changing through
    time. Dry spells and heat waves are relatively rare events.
  11: Dry spells are negatively correlated with growth in crop production. The negative
    correlation is more pronounced in arid regions and during drier years, suggesting
    compounding effects of water stress at different timescales.
  12: The primary interest is in capturing the direct effect of dry spells on the
    growth in the FAO CPI. The direct effects of dry spells are suggested to be transitory.
  17: Dry spells have a statistically significant negative impact on food price growth,
    even after accounting for drought conditions.
  18: The main finding is negative effects of dry spells on growth in crop production,
    regardless of heat wave duration
  19: "Dry spell days are less damaging when heat waves occur in the same year. Joint\
    \ exposure to dry spells and heat waves only shows a compounding effect for 12+\
    \ day heat waves. The effects of dry spells on crop production are more damaging\
    \ in more arid locations (aridity index \u2264 0.65)."
  20: "Dry spells are primarily damaging in countries and years with aggregate annual\
    \ water deficits (12-month SPEI \u2264 0)."
  21: Dry spells have a modest negative impact on crop production, which is exacerbated
    by water deficits and aridity, and potentially mitigated by irrigation.
  26: Burke et al. (2015) shows a non-linear relationship between temperature and
    economic production.
  29: Heat Waves, Climate Change, and Economic Output.
  31: Identifies specific climate-related drivers affecting crop yields.
  35: "Dry spell exposure has a negative correlation with crop production growth overall.\
    \ The negative correlation is stronger under drought conditions (SPEI \u2264 0)\
    \ and in more arid regions (Aridity Index below median)."
  36: Heat waves have a significant negative impact on growth in FAO CPI, drought
    has a positive impact, and longer dry spells tend to have a negative impact. There
    is a non-linear (quadratic) relationship between mean temperature and FAO CPI
    growth. The impact of temperature on growth in FAO CPI is negative, with a p value
    of less than 0.1. The impact of heat waves on growth in FAO CPI is negative, with
    a p value of less than 0.01. The impact of drought (SPEI) on growth in FAO CPI
    is positive, with a p value of less than 0.05.
  37: The impact of dry spell days is generally negative and significant, though small
    in magnitude. Heat wave days have a larger negative and significant impact. The
    interaction between dry spell days and heat wave days is generally positive and
    significant. Joint exposure to dry spells and heat waves (DSHW) has a negative
    impact when it is included in the model, but the effect varies depending on the
    heat wave duration threshold and is not always statistically significant. The
    coefficient for joint exposure appears to be increasing as the minimum duration
    for heatwaves increases, with up to -0.1845 for 12+ day heat waves.
  38: Dry spell impacts on CPI are heterogeneous, with more arid and drought-prone
    areas experiencing larger negative effects. Irrigation may lessen the negative
    impact of dry spells on CPI. Cereal yield may increase during dry spells with
    high aridity.
  39: The analysis examines how the effects of dry spells and heatwaves on GDP depend
    on drought and aridity conditions in a country, using country-level variation.
  41: The estimated marginal effect of an additional dry spell day is generally negative.
    The effect becomes more negative and statistically significant (at 5% level or
    better) as the minimum duration of dry spells increases from 28 to 35 days. Longer
    heatwave durations also tend to increase the magnitude of the negative effect.
  42: Current year dry spell days have a statistically significant negative impact
    (-0.0012**) on the outcome. The impact of dry spell days can persist for multiple
    years, with the signs of the lagged effects varying. The p-value for the hypothesis
    that the sum of coefficients is zero is reported, indicating whether there is
    a growth effect of dry spells (only a level effect).
  43: Dry spells have a statistically significant negative impact on the log of value
    added per capita in agriculture, fisheries, and forestry.
  46: "Dry spells have a statistically significant negative effect on the outcome\
    \ of interest (unspecified, but referred to as an \"effect\") in areas with below-median\
    \ aridity and under drought conditions (SPEI \u2264 0)."
Methodology:
  2: Global panel data analysis focusing on multi-timescale and multi-stressor perspective.
  5: Statistical approach isolates country-specific dry spell exposure anomalies
  6: The number of dry spell days is calculated using daily precipitation totals from
    the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) spanning 1979 to 2016, gridded to 0.5-degree
    latitude and longitude.
  10: The analysis adjusts for lagged log of agricultural value added per capita.
    They control for climate regimes, trends, and droughts when isolating the effects
    of punctuated weather events. The dataset includes 118 countries, excluding Sub-Saharan
    Africa due to data concerns.
  11: Fixed effects models relating growth in the FAO CPI to dry spell exposure. Examining
    subsamples that vary with background water stress.
  12: The paper uses a linear regression model with country and year fixed effects
    to estimate the impact of dry spells, heat waves, and drought on the growth rate
    of the FAO CPI. It also uses distributed lag models to examine the persistence
    of dry spell effects.
  13: "The paper uses regression models (equations 2, 3, and 4) to analyze the impact\
    \ of dry spells and heat waves on a macroeconomic outcome. Models incorporate\
    \ fixed effects (\U0001D707\U0001D456, \U0001D719\U0001D461) and control variables\
    \ (\U0001D44B\U0001D456\U0001D461). Alternative approaches involving interactions\
    \ and sub-sample analysis based on drought and aridity are also mentioned, with\
    \ results in the appendix."
  17: The analysis uses models that adjust for annual precipitation, isolating the
    effects of dry spells beyond the impact of overall rainfall.
  18: Regression analysis (equation 2), sequential g-estimation
  19: Regression analysis is used to estimate the effects of dry spells and heat waves
    on crop production. The models include potential interactive effects of dry spells
    and heat waves.
  20: "Regression analysis, sequential g-estimation. The analysis is applicable when\
    \ a water deficit (12-month SPEI \u2264 0) is observed. The effect of irrigation\
    \ is tested by modifying the specification to mitigate potential effects of irrigation\
    \ on crop choice and baseline productivity."
  21: Observational study using national-scale data; examining the impact of dry spell
    days on crop production while accounting for other stressors like water deficits,
    aridity, and irrigation.

    shocks and economic growth.

  35: Panel bootstrap with 1000 replicates is used to compute the means and confidence
    intervals of the correlations. Correlations are between within-country demeaned
    FAO CPI growth rates and within-country demeaned dry spell days.
  36: Baseline model estimates using equation (1), omitting fixed effects, year effects,
    and trends. Standard errors are clustered at the country level. The table shows
    results for varying minimum dry spell durations (7, 14, 21, 28, 35 days).
  37: "The authors estimate Equation (2) using regression analysis, clustering standard\
    \ errors at the country level. They examine the effects of dry spell days, heat\
    \ wave days, the interaction of these two, and the impact of days of joint dry\
    \ spell and heat wave occurrence. The analysis uses 28+ day dry spells. The models\
    \ are estimated with and without a specific term (\U0001D6FC4) for joint dry spell\
    \ and heat wave exposure."
  38: Regression analysis allowing the effects of dry spells to vary with aridity,
    drought, or irrigation. Standard errors are clustered at the country level. Results
    are applicable when analyzing the impact of dry spells with heatwaves under varying
    aridity, drought, and irrigation conditions.
  39: Distributed lag models are used to analyze the impact of environmental variables
    on GDP over time (up to 5 lags). Split-sample regressions and interaction terms
    are used to examine heterogeneity based on country-level aridity and drought.
  40: "Sequential g-estimation is applied to a model (Equation A3) that includes dry\
    \ spell exposure (DS), heatwave exposure (HW), drought (D), interactions between\
    \ dry spell/heatwave exposure and drought, control variables (X), individual fixed\
    \ effects (\u03BC), time fixed effects (\u03C6), and an error term (\u03B5). A\
    \ demediation step (Equation A4) removes estimates of terms involving drought\
    \ (D) to estimate the direct effects of dry spells at different SPEI levels (D0)."
  41: The analysis uses Equation (1) (from the main text) to estimate the effect of
    an additional dry spell day, clustered standard errors at the country level, for
    different combinations of minimum dry spell and heat wave durations
  42: The study uses a distributed lag model to estimate the effect of dry spell days
    on the outcome. Lagged effects are considered up to 5 years. Standard errors are
    clustered at the country level. Estimates reflect the effect of additional dry
    spell days in specifications with 28+ day dry spells and 9+ day heat waves. The
    results are applicable to specifications including dry spell days, heatwave days,
    drought, temperature, precipitation and their squares as current year variables
    and with lags from 1 to 5 years.
  43: Panel regression analysis with standard errors clustered at the country level.
    Baseline specification is equation (1) in the main text, with modifications including
    temporal weighting of dry spell and heat wave measures using cropped area, SPEI
    quantification prior to the hottest days, adjustments for temperature bins, polynomial
    precipitation and temperature terms, linear and cubic country trends, lagged environmental
    variables and value added, and instrumentation.
  46: Split-sample estimation and interaction terms are used to analyze the heterogeneous
    effects of dry spells based on country-level aridity and SPEI. Models also include
    the number of heat wave days. The aridity split is based on the median country
    value of the aridity index (0.997).
More Notes:
  2: The study suggests a possible role of adaptation (irrigation) in dampening the
    effects of dry spells.
  5: Irrigation availability is investigated as a moderator of the effects of dry
    spells on growth in crop production.
  6: The paper isolates the production consequences of dry spells by using average
    2014-2016 international prices for weighting crop production, such that weights
    do not reflect local price responses. The paper considers alternatives of j=7,
    14, 21, 28, and 35 days for the calculation of dry spell days.
  11: The differences in correlation across subsamples (high vs. low aridity index;
    positive vs. negative SPEI) are not statistically significant, though the signs
    are consistent with water stress having compounding effects.
  12: The paper adjusts for covariates including average temperature and its square,
    total precipitation and its square, and country-specific quadratic time trends.
  13: "The analysis leverages both between-country and within-country differences\
    \ in climate exposure and aridity/drought conditions. The term \U0001D437\U0001D446\
    \U0001D456\U0001D461\U0001D43B\U0001D44A\U0001D456\U0001D461 captures exposure\
    \ to both dry spells and heat waves during the same year, while \U0001D437\U0001D446\
    \U0001D43B\U0001D44A\U0001D456,\U0001D461 captures simultaneous and co-located\
    \ prolonged exposure to low precipitation and high heat."
  15: The paper is concerned that drought may lie on the causal path between dry spells
    and crop production, making it a bad control variable. Sequential g-estimation
    is used to address this concern.
  17: The paper also considers the role of heat waves in conjunction with dry spells,
    and the potential mitigating effect of irrigation, although this is only mentioned
    briefly on this page.
  18: The authors tested the robustness of their results using various covariates
    and alternative model specifications, finding the results to be generally consistent.
  19: The analysis suggests that the dry spells variable may already embed heat because
    it focuses on exposure during the hottest part of the year.
  21: The analysis suggests that irrigation may facilitate adaptation to dry spells,
    leading to smaller or absent losses in crop production.
  37: "The authors investigate the heterogeneity in dry spell impacts based on the\
    \ exposure to heat waves. The duration of the heat waves is varied (3+, 6+, 9+,\
    \ and 12+ days) to determine if the impact differs. The note clarifies that \U0001D6FC\
    1 is the coefficient for dry spell days, \U0001D6FC2 is the coefficient for heat\
    \ wave days, \U0001D6FC3 is the coefficient for the interaction of dry spell days\
    \ and heat wave days, and \U0001D6FC4 is the coefficient for days of joint dry\
    \ spell and heat wave occurrence."

    on this page but is discussed in the main text (using Equation (1)).
  43: The table presents robustness checks of baseline results, with different model
    specifications in each column. The number of observations varies across specifications.
  46: The specific outcome being analyzed is not explicitly stated in the provided
    excerpt, but is implied to be a negative economic impact due to the negative coefficients.  Heat
    wave days are also controlled for in the analysis.
