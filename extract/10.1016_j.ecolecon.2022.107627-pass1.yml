Drivers of Risk:
  2: Dry spells (specifically 4-5 week dry spells during the hottest part of the year),
    drought, aridity, and heat waves are impacting crop production.
  3: Dry spells, potentially exacerbated by climate change, can negatively impact
    crop yields. Co-occurring stressors, such as longer-term water stress (aridity,
    multi-month/multi-year droughts, low annual precipitation), can interact with
    dry spells to affect plants.

Highlights:
  2: Losses in yields from dry spells are concentrated in areas not equipped for irrigation,
    suggesting a role of adaptation.
  3: "Understanding the impacts of dry spells on agriculture is likely to grow in\
    \ importance due to links between dry spell occurrence and climate change and\
    \ the potential contribution of dry spells to recent \u2018flash droughts\u2019\
    ."
  5: Dry spells should lower growth in crop production, with effects that are larger
    in magnitude when dry spells co-occur with heat waves, drought, or aridity.
  7: The study quantifies dry spell days, especially in relation to cropland exposure,
    by weighting dry spell days based on the fraction of the grid cell devoted to
    cropland.
  9: No relevant information
  10: Exposures to water and heat stress are related and evolving. Heat wave and dry
    spell prevalence is substantially different between more arid and less arid countries.
    Drought is related to dry spell days in arid countries, especially at the end
    of the sample period. High numbers of heat wave days are more common when SPEI
    is below zero. Exposure to dry spells, heat waves, and drought conditions is changing
    through time. Dry spells and heat waves are relatively rare events.
  11: Dry spells have a negative correlation with crop production growth, and this
    effect appears more pronounced in already arid regions and drier years.
  12: The direct effects of dry spells on growth in the FAO CPI are estimated to be
    transitory.
  13: The analysis aims to quantify the differential effects of combined exposure
    to dry spells and heat waves compared to each stressor occurring in isolation
    and also captures the additional impact of true simultaneous exposure to both
    stressors.
  14: The study suggests that available irrigation may mitigate the effects of dry
    spells on cereal yields.
  16: Dry spells of at least 28 days have significant negative effects on crop production
    growth.
  17: Dry spells have a negative impact on agricultural productivity (as measured
    by FAO CPI), even when accounting for drought. The effects are more pronounced
    with longer dry spell durations (at least 9 days).
  18: Main effects of an additional day in a 28+ day dry spell on growth in crop production
    are negative. The effects of dry spells vary with exposure to heat waves. Baseline
    results are robust to a range of checks.
  19: "Dry spell days are less damaging when heat waves occur in the same year. There\
    \ is evidence of a compounding effect of joint exposure to dry spells and 12+\
    \ day heat waves. The effects of dry spells are damaging when they occur in locations\
    \ that are more arid (aridity index \u2264 0.65)."
  20: "Dry spells are primarily damaging in countries and years with an aggregate\
    \ annual water deficit. Dry spells are also damaging when they occur in cells\
    \ with less area equipped for irrigation, though only after specification modifications.\
    \ A na\xEFve comparison of effect sizes reveals larger reductions in FAO CPI growth\
    \ when a dry spell occurs in a location equipped for irrigation than from a similar\
    \ spell in an area without such equipment."
  21: Dry spells are more damaging in locations experiencing annual water deficits
    or are arid. Dry spells appear less harmful when occurring during the same year
    as heat wave days. Dry spells are less damaging in areas more equipped for irrigation.
  22: Short-term water stress (dry spells) is more damaging when longer-term water
    stress (drought or aridity) is present. There is an absence of an interactive
    effect of dry spell days and heat wave days when they occur simultaneously.
  23: Strong evidence of non-additivity of heat and water stress effects on crops
    found when dry spells and heat waves occur in the same year.
  24: Smaller effects of dry spells identified in irrigated areas are consistent with
    findings in studies of drought.
  25: Adaptations beyond irrigation, like nutrient management, are suggested to mitigate
    effects of hot, dry weather.
  26: Mentions underappreciated plant vulnerabilities to heat waves. Mentions anthropogenic
    warming has increased drought risk in California.
  28: Greater sensitivity to drought accompanies maize yield increase in the US Midwest.
  33: Visual comparison of heat and water stress relationships at the country level
    between 1979 and 2016.
  34: No relevant information
  35: "Dry spell exposure is generally negatively correlated with crop production\
    \ growth. The correlation is more negative under drought conditions (SPEI \u2264\
    \ 0) and in regions with lower aridity indices (AI below median). However, most\
    \ differences are not statistically significant."
  37: The impact of dry spells and heat waves appears to be sensitive to heat wave
    duration. The interaction and joint exposure terms suggest that the combined effect
    of dry spells and heat waves may be different from the sum of their individual
    effects. Some interaction and joint effect terms are statistically significant.
  38: The impact of dry spells on CPI is more negative in more arid or drought-prone
    areas. The impact of dry spells on cereal yield is more positive in more irrigated
    areas.
  41: The estimated effect of an additional dry spell day is generally negative, with
    larger negative effects associated with longer dry spell durations and longer
    heat wave durations. Some results are statistically significant at the 0.05 and
    0.01 levels.
  42: Current-year dry spell days have a statistically significant negative effect
    (p < 0.05 in all models). The effect of prior-year dry spell days varies in sign
    and statistical significance. The p-value for the test that the sum of coefficients
    equals 0 is generally high, meaning we fail to reject the null hypothesis of no
    growth effect.
  44: An additional day of prolonged dry spells (21+ days, 28+ days, 35+ days) has
    a statistically significant negative effect.
  45: Focusing on the hottest 90 or 120 days in a grid cell shows a negative effect
    of dry spell days on crop growth, though the magnitude and significance vary depending
    on whether crop area weighting is used.
  46: Dry spell effects are heterogeneous based on aridity and drought conditions
    (SPEI). The effect of an additional dry spell day is statistically significant
    (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05) in below-median aridity and negative SPEI (drought) conditions.
  47: The effect of an additional dry spell day decreases as the SPEI value increases
    (from -2 to 2). All effects are statistically significant at p<0.05 when SPEI
    is -2, -1, or 0.
Methodology:
  2: The analysis uses a global panel of daily precipitation and temperature data
    from 1979 to 2016.
  3: The paper discusses the importance of accounting for simultaneously co-occurring
    stressors when understanding the effects of dry spells on agriculture.
  5: Analysis of a panel dataset spanning 1979-2016 relating aggregate crop production
    in a country and year to exposure to dry spells and related environmental stressors;
    statistical approach isolates country-specific dry spell exposure anomalies.
  7: They classify days as abnormally dry based on precipitation falling below a threshold
    calculated as 1.5 standard deviations below the mean for a grid cell and day of
    year, using a 31-day window across all years. They identify dry spells and count
    dry spell days. Main analysis considers abnormally dry days during the historically
    hottest 90 days in each grid cell. Supplementary analyses consider the hottest
    120 days or any time of the year. Spatially weighted average of cell-specific
    dry spell variables are calculated to get a single value per country.
  8: The study uses spatial averaging to summarize heat waves and joint exposure across
    different areas.
  9: "The study uses data on drought (SPEI), temperature, precipitation, aridity (FAO\u2019\
    s aridity index), and irrigation (FAO\u2019s AQUASTAT database) to analyze climate\
    \ impacts. They partition cells based on the fraction of cropland equipped for\
    \ irrigation relative to the median."
  10: Analysis adjusts for lagged log of agricultural value added per capita. Excludes
    Sub-Saharan Africa due to concerns over data reliability.
  11: Fixed effects models relating growth in the FAO CPI in a country and year to
    dry spell exposure. The analysis uses country-specific means of variables. Correlations
    are also examined within subsamples based on aridity index and SPEI.
  12: Regression analysis (equation 1) with country and year fixed effects, controlling
    for covariates including temperature, precipitation, and country-specific time
    trends. Also, distributed lag models were used in the appendix.
  13: The paper uses regression analysis (Equations 2, 3, and 4) to assess the impacts
    of dry spells and heat waves, both in isolation and in combination, on the outcome
    variable. It considers simultaneous and co-located exposure, as well as the moderating
    effects of drought and aridity. It splits dry spell days and heat wave days into
    high and low aridity/drought stricken cells to estimate the effect of exposure
    at different levels of aridity and drought.
  14: The analysis compares dry spells and heat wave days across more irrigated and
    less irrigated areas by quantifying them separately and using a series of models.
  15: The authors estimate models (1)-(5) using ordinary least squares with country
    and year fixed effects, using clustered standard errors. They also employ sequential
    g-estimation in robustness checks to address the concern that drought may be on
    the causal path between dry spells and crop production. Sequential g-estimation
    estimates controlled direct effects in the presence of a mediating variable (drought)
    in two stages. The first stage estimates the contribution of drought to the outcome.
    The estimated mediator effect is subtracted from the dependent variable to obtain
    a demediated outcome upon which the direct effect of dry spells is estimated in
    a second stage. Inference for sequential g-estimation is conducted by bootstrapping
    both stages at the panel unit level to account for potential clustering.
  16: Regression analysis with various adjustments for lagged effects, temperature
    and precipitation exposure, time trends, and cropping patterns; sequential g-estimation
    and SPEI; alternative specifications for robustness
  17: The analysis uses models that adjust for annual precipitation to isolate the
    direct effects of dry spells.
  18: Regression analysis, sequential g-estimation to account for the potential influence
    of dry spells on drought, models including area cropped at the time using MIRCA2000
    data, SPEI covering different time periods, lags of log value added per capita
    in agriculture, fisheries, and forestry (used directly or instrumented for with
    lagged log GDP per capita), lags of dry spell and heat wave exposure, more flexible
    polynomials in annual temperature and precipitation, and linear and cubic per-country
    trends.
  19: Regression analysis using equations (3) and (4). Analysis considers simultaneous
    exposure to dry spells and heat waves, as well as dry spells occurring in the
    hottest 90 days, hottest 120 days, or full year.
  20: The analysis examines the effects of dry spells on FAO CPI growth and cereal
    yields, considering factors like aridity, water surplus/deficit (using SPEI),
    and irrigation. It uses cross-country variation in national aridity or drought
    measures. Sequential g-estimation is used to examine how dry spell effects vary
    with drought levels. The analysis also considers the impact of irrigation by modifying
    the specification to mitigate potential effects of irrigation on crop choice and
    baseline productivity.
  21: Estimates suggest relationships between dry spells and crop production; analysis
    considers baseline productivity levels and irrigation.
  23: Analysis based on globally gridded temperature and precipitation data at a country
    scale, focusing on dry spells during the hottest part of the year.
  24: Emphasizes that the exploration of adaptation is preliminary and discusses the
    potential use of instrumental variables to address endogeneity in irrigation use.
  25: Suggestions of mitigating hot, dry weather impacts through adaptations like
    nutrient management.
  26: Mentions meta-analysis of drought and heat stress combination impact on crop
    yield and yield components.
  28: Uses standardized precipitation index (SPI) and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration
    index (SPEI) for drought analysis.
  31: Spatiotemporal patterns and historical changes of drought effects on US maize
    and soybean production
  33: Scatter plots showing the relationship between SPEI (medium-term water stress)
    and dry spell days (short-term water stress) for countries, differentiated by
    aridity index (long-term water stress) and heat wave days (short-term heat stress),
    compared across 1979 and 2016. Trend lines are included for more/less arid countries.
  34: Summary statistics are calculated at the observation level for all variables,
    whether or not it is time-invariant for a given country (aridity, irrigation).
  35: Panel bootstrap with 1000 replicates is used to compute 95% confidence intervals.
    Correlations are calculated between within-country demeaned FAO CPI growth rates
    and within-country demeaned dry spell days for 28+ day dry spells. Samples are
    divided based on SPEI values (<= 0 and > 0) and Aridity Index values (below and
    above the country-level median of 0.997).
  37: The analysis uses a regression model (Equation 2) to estimate the effects of
    dry spell days, heat wave days, and their interaction on the outcome of interest.
    Standard errors are clustered at the country level. The analysis considers heat
    waves of different durations (3+, 6+, 9+, and 12+ days) and only uses 28+ day
    dry spells.  Within each heat wave duration category, the analysis is performed
    twice, once assuming an interaction term and once estimating a joint exposure
    effect.
  38: The analysis uses equations (3), (4), and (5) to estimate the effects of dry
    spells while allowing them to vary with aridity, drought, or irrigation. Thresholds
    are used to define 'less' and 'more' categories for each moderator (aridity index=0.65,
    SPEI=0, and area equipped for irrigation equal to the median among all cells with
    nonzero irrigation). Standard errors are clustered at the country level. The analysis
    uses data with 4072 or 4031 observations.
  39: Interaction-term estimates are used to examine how the effects of dry spells
    depend on drought and aridity.
  41: The effect is estimated using Equation (1) from the main text, with standard
    errors clustered at the country level. Statistical significance is indicated by
    *, **, and *** for p<0.1, p<0.05, and p<0.01, respectively.
  42: Distributed lag model estimation, with standard errors clustered at the country
    level; environmental variables enter as current-year variables and in lagged form
    from 1 to 5 years; columns (1)-(5) successively introduce additional lags.
  43: Analysis includes various model variants of a baseline specification with adjustments
    for temporal weighting, climate indices, temperature adjustments, and trend adjustments.
  44: Sequential g-estimation is used to account for the potential influence of dry
    spells on the 12-month SPEI. Panel bootstrap is used for confidence interval estimation.
  45: Uses variants of equation (1) for a 28+ day dry spell and 9+ day heat wave.
    Dry spell and heat wave variables are constructed using different subsets of days
    in the year (hottest 90 days, hottest 120 days, all days). Some models weight
    days temporally by cropped area using the MIRCA2000 dataset. Standard errors are
    clustered at the country level.
  46: 'Split-sample estimation and interaction terms are used to analyze heterogeneous
    effects of dry spells based on country-level aridity index and SPEI (Standardized
    Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index). Split-sample estimation allows the effects
    of all covariates to differ by subsample. Interaction terms only allows dry spell
    effects to differ across groups of observations. Significance levels are indicated:
    ***: p<0.01, **: p<0.05, *: p<0.1.'
  47: Sequential g-estimation to account for the potential influence of dry spells
    on the 12-month SPEI. Includes controls for heat wave days and an interaction
    between dry spell days and SPEI. 95% confidence intervals estimated via panel
    bootstrap.
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on punctuated events and multiple stressors, complementing
    prior investigations focused solely on longer-term phenomena or isolated extreme
    heat/precipitation events.
  3: The paper suggests that focusing solely on the duration of the longest dry spell
    may miss important aspects of exposure. The paper notes a correlation between
    dry spell occurrence and longer-term water stress.
  5: Investigates whether irrigation availability moderates the effects of dry spells
    on growth in crop production.
  7: The study uses data compiled by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) using raw
    observations from the Global Telecommunications System (GTS), resulting in approximately
    980 million gridded observations.
  9: The aridity index is calculated as the ratio of precipitation and average annual
    potential evapotranspiration using a version of the Penman-Monteith Equation.
    When a variable is needed at the national scale, they construct national weighted
    exposure using the same spatial weighting scheme as for the dry spell variable.
  10: Figure 1 (not provided) shows relationships between aridity index, heat wave
    days, dry spell days, drought level, and SPEI. Table 1 (not provided) provides
    summary statistics.
  11: The differences in correlations across subsamples (high vs. low aridity index;
    positive vs. negative SPEI) are not statistically significant, but their sign
    is consistent with water stress at different timescales having compounding effects.
  13: The paper explores alternative approaches in the Appendix, such as interacting
    dry spell and heat wave variables with country-level drought and aridity or splitting
    the sample based on these factors.
  15: The dependent variable in the analysis of sequential g-estimation is CPI growth.
    OLS may induce spurious correlations between dry spells and CPI growth if drought
    and CPI growth are confounded by omitted variables.
  16: The analysis uses the MIRCA2000 data to weight dry spell exposure by the fraction
    of a grid cell that is cropped. The paper explores the effects of dry spells with
    different minimum durations.
  17: The paper examines heterogeneity in dry spell impacts, considering how they
    depend on drought, aridity, and heat waves, and explores the potential role of
    irrigation in mitigating the effects of dry spells.
  18: Estimates from models including log value added per capita in agriculture, fisheries,
    and forestry are somewhat smaller in magnitude.
  20: The study uses the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)
    to measure water surplus/deficit. The analysis controls for crop choice and baseline
    productivity in examining irrigation effects.
  21: The effect of irrigation is not necessarily causal.
  23: Analysis limited by statistical power due to rarity of events and resolution
    limits of weather data.
  24: There is a recognition of constraints in current irrigation data which only
    provide static views and do not reflect within-season water use.
  25: Constraints on water resources limit irrigation as an adaptive measure.
  28: Several papers focus on maize and crop yields in the US and China, and the relationship
    between climate variables and agricultural outcomes.
  33: The clustering of blue points (less arid countries) around the x-axis in the
    2016 plot is a potentially important observation.
  34: No relevant information
  37: The dependent variable and unit of observation are not specified on this page.
    The outcome variable is not described here, nor is the geographic scope.
  38: Spatial weights (crop area, cereal area, cereal production) are used to aggregate
    data to the country level. Statistical significance is indicated by *, **, and
    *** for p<0.1, p<0.05, and p<0.01, respectively.
  42: The definition of dry spell days (28+ day dry spells) and heat waves (9+ day
    heat waves) is specified in the notes.
  44: The table presents controlled direct effects of dry spell days, controlling
    for heat wave days.
  45: The study considers different time windows (90 days, 120 days, full year) and
    weighting schemes (unweighted, crop area weighted) to assess the sensitivity of
    the results.
  46: No relevant information
  47: The table presents the controlled direct effect, meaning that it's accounting
    for the influence of dry spells on SPEI.
Quantitative material:
  2: The study provides evidence that 4-5 week dry spells during the hottest part
    of the year depress growth in crop production.
  5: Year-to-year growth (%/year) in the FAO Crop Production Index (FAO CPI)
  7: 99.82% of grid cell and day pairs have a precipitation threshold of zero when
    defining abnormally dry days (1.5 SD below average). 99.77% have a zero threshold
    when defining abnormally dry days as 1 SD below average.
  9: The study uses a 12-month SPEI and also considers SPEI averaged over the months
    prior to the start of the hottest 90 days. Irrigation data is provided as an estimated
    fraction of the area irrigated per pixel (circa 2005).
  10: The dataset includes 118 countries.
  11: "Growth rates in the FAO CPI are significantly negatively correlated with exposure\
    \ to dry spells, particularly in more arid countries (aridity index below the\
    \ median) and in countries experiencing drier years (SPEI \u2264 0)."
  12: Focus on capturing the marginal direct effect of an additional dry spell day
    on growth in the FAO CPI.
  13: The paper presents three equations (2, 3, and 4) that model the relationship
    between the outcome variable G_it and different combinations of dry spells, heat
    waves, drought, and aridity. The coefficients (alpha, gamma, delta) represent
    the quantified impact of each factor.
  16: Significant negative effects of dry spell days when the dry spell is at least
    28 days long (j=28); negative point estimates for minimum durations shorter (7,
    14, or 21 days) or longer (35 days)
  17: Each additional dry spell day beyond 28 days during the hottest part of the
    year is associated with approximately 0.1 percentage point lower growth in the
    FAO CPI.
  18: Negative main effects of an additional day in a 28+ day dry spell on growth
    in crop production.
  19: The main effect of heat waves (second row in Table 4) is an order of magnitude
    larger than the interaction between dry spells and heat waves.
  20: Larger reductions in FAO CPI growth when a dry spell occurs in a location equipped
    for irrigation than from a similar spell in an area without such equipment (Table
    5, column 3).
  21: Dry spell days exhibit a modest average direct effect on growth in crop production.
  25: No quantitative information provided on this page.
  26: Mentions specific journal issues and page numbers, suggesting some studies contain
    quantitative data.
  28: Net benefits to US soy and maize yields from intensifying hourly rainfall, changes
    in drought sensitivity of US maize yields, climate trends and global crop production
    since 1980.
  33: Country-level data on dry spell days, SPEI, heat wave days, and aridity index
    for 1979 and 2016
  34: Provides summary statistics (Min, Mean, Median, Max, SD) for dry spell days,
    heat wave days, drought (SPEI), aridity index, irrigation, average temperature
    (C), and annual precipitation (m).
  35: "Correlations between dry spell exposure and crop production growth, including\
    \ mean correlations and 95% confidence intervals for different water stress conditions\
    \ (SPEI \u2264 0, SPEI > 0, Aridity Index below/above median)"
  37: The table provides coefficients, standard errors, and significance levels for
    dry spell days, heat wave days, their interaction, and the joint occurrence of
    dry spells and heat waves. The coefficients are all small, in the range of -0.1845
    to 0.0410.
  38: Provides quantitative estimates of the effects of an additional dry spell day
    on CPI and cereal yield, with values presented in Table 5. For example, in more
    arid areas, an additional dry spell day decreases CPI by 0.0013** (significant
    at the 5% level).
  41: The table provides estimated marginal effects (ranging from -0.0001 to -0.0013)
    of an additional dry spell day under various combinations of dry spell and heat
    wave durations, along with standard errors.
  42: Coefficients on dry spell days in a distributed lag model, standard errors,
    p-values for the coefficients, and p-value for a test of the null hypothesis that
    the sum of dry spell coefficients is zero.
  43: The estimated effect of an additional dry spell day ranges approximately from
    -0.0010 to -0.0014.
  44: An additional dry spell day of 21+ days is associated with a statistically significant
    controlled direct effect of -0.0009 (p<0.05). Similar statistically significant
    negative effects are found for longer dry spells (28+ days and 35+ days).
  45: An additional dry spell day is associated with changes in growth in the FAO
    CPI ranging from -0.0013 to -0.0001, with varying levels of statistical significance
    (p < 0.1, p < 0.05).
  46: Effect of an additional dry spell day on an unspecified outcome (coefficients
    ranging from approximately -0.0017 to 0.0003, with standard errors provided).
    Median country value of the aridity index used is 0.997.
  47: Controlled direct effect of an additional day in a dry spell varies from -0.0017
    to -5.00E-04 depending on the SPEI value.
