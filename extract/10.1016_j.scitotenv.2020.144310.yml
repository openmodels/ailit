  30: Changes in supply and demand for ecosystem services due to erosion, land-use
    change, evolution in preferences, and willingness to pay.
  31: Impacts of coastal erosion on the value of ecosystem services are unevenly distributed;
    Shoreline retreat rate varies substantially between coasts; Storm surges.

Highlights:
  6: No relevant information
  7: Presents the first pan-European analysis of ecosystem service loss due to SLR-induced
    coastal erosion. Hypothesizes that coastal erosion will have uneven impacts on
    ecosystem services across Europe but locally those impacts will be significant.
  15: Analysis of impacts at national and regional scales using the value of services
    lost relative to GDP.
  16: Coastal zone ecosystem services in 2018 were valued at 494 billion euros, but
    declined by 323 million euros between 2000 and 2018.
  17: Climate change will cause land cover changes, leading to a decline in ecosystem
    services, with a potential loss of up to 42 billion euros per year. Wetlands are
    disproportionately affected.
  18: Beaches, sands, and dunes are the most endangered in relative terms. Relative
    losses to salt marshes are second-highest but the biggest in absolute terms. Agricultural
    areas associated with an intense mode of production would be the least affected.
  20: Coastal ecosystem services vary substantially between countries, with the UK,
    France, and Italy having the highest total value, but Greece having the highest
    relative value as a percentage of GDP. Denmark is projected to lose the most services
    relative to GDP, while France is projected to have the highest absolute losses.
    Germany may experience a large loss relative to service value.
  21: The Netherlands was projected to lose a considerable share of its relatively
    small amount of services. France, Albania, Finland, and the United Kingdom could
    all lose more than 10% of their 2018 services under certain scenarios. Bosnia
    and Herzegovina, Belgium, Cyprus, Lithuania, and Montenegro would most likely
    lose no more than 1%.
  22: Worst-affected regions are concentrated along the southeastern coast of the
    North Sea, Bay of Biscay, and eastern Mediterranean Sea. Danish, German, and French
    regions most frequently appear on top in absolute terms. Many Greek regions are
    projected to be among the most affected in relative economic terms. Losses relative
    to 2018 services would be particularly large in several districts of Lower Saxony
    in Germany, especially Friesland (59-65% by 2100). Imathia (Greece) could suffer
    the highest loss among European regions of 65% (under the worst-case scenario).
  23: Land use transitions barely changed the overall value of ecosystem services
    in Europe between 2000 and 2018, but local effects could be considerable; Uncertainty
    in ecosystem service valuation has a large impact on the estimated total value
    and projected losses; Deforestation and the expansion of artificial surfaces caused
    greater losses than the liquidation of such areas.
  24: Ecosystem service loss is sensitive to demographic growth. Southern and central
    Europe are projected to encounter significant demographic decline, in contrast
    to northern Europe.
  30: Uncertainty in ecosystem service valuation has a lower influence on relative
    loss estimations than the uncertainty in coastal erosion projections. Changes
    to the value of existing services would change the value of future losses considered
    in the same reference prices.
  31: Accurate valuation of ecosystem services is important, and the contribution
    of services to local economies needs to be evaluated.

    growth in relation to socio-economic pathways and environmental changes.

    of coastal erosion projection under RCP8.5 for a given NUTS 3 region.
  56: "Deforestation had the largest negative impact on coastal ecosystem services\
    \ over the period 2000-2018 (-\u20AC1961 million). Reforestation had the largest\
    \ positive impact over the same period (\u20AC971 million). Overall, coastal ecosystem\
    \ services decreased by \u20AC323 million between 2000 and 2018."
  58: The paper projects the loss of coastal ecosystem services as a percentage of
    2018 GDP for each country under different scenarios, including the effect of future
    population change.
  60: The table shows significant variation in the value of coastal ecosystem services
    depending on land cover type, with maritime wetlands (salt marshes, salines) having

    power parity for the EU (28 countries before the UK's departure).

    from United Nations (2019).
  16: Annual ecosystem service of the coastal zone in 2018 was 494 billion euros (3%

    ecosystem services values in billions of 2018 euros, broken down by CLC class
    (Artificial surfaces, Agricultural areas, Forest and semi-natural areas, Wetlands,
    Water). Quantitative estimates of losses in ecosystem services for beaches, sands,
    and dunes, and salt marshes, in billions of euros per annum by 2050 and 2100 are
    given.
  20: "United Kingdom had the highest total in 2018 with more than 59 billion euros\
    \ of annual service; France (54 billion euros); Italy (50 billion euros); Greece\u2019\
    s services total 41 billion euros; Services in Poland and Germany did not exceed\
    \ 1% of GDP. Denmark projected to lose most services relative to GDP in all scenarios\
    \ reaching 1.2-1.6% (0.8-2.4%) by 2100. Losses of more than 0.3% of GDP per annum\
    \ likely in Estonia and Finland, possible in Norway, Latvia, Sweden, and the United\
    \ Kingdom. Impacts would be almost negligible in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgium,\
    \ Poland, and Malta (less than 0.02% of GDP). Highest absolute losses in France\
    \ (14-19% share in Europe), UK (11-17%), Denmark (12-15%), and Germany (9-16%).\
    \ Denmark projected to lose 9-12% (7-19%) of 2018 service value by 2100. Germany\
    \ might lose a greater share than any other European country (21%)."
  21: Figure 4 shows coastal ecosystem services per year based on CLC 2018, in billions
    of euros and as % of 2018 GDP, by country.
  22: "In the best case, 9 NUTS 3 regions would lose ecosystem services equal to more\
    \ than 5% of their regional GDP, while 429 regions would lose services worth less\
    \ than 1% of regional GDP. In the worst case, these numbers would be 40 and 369\
    \ respectively. Only 24 regions would lose more than 10% of 2018 services in the\
    \ best case scenario, but 95 would in the worst-case scenario. The Danish region\
    \ of North Jutland and the German district of Nordfriesland could lose about 2\
    \ billion euros of services. The Albanian county of Gjirokast\xEBr could incur\
    \ the highest relative loss in economic terms (41% of GDP in the most extreme\
    \ case)."
  23: Land erosion was smaller than land accretion; 58% of accreted land was in the
    form of artificial surfaces; Total value of ecosystem services in 2018 would have
    ranged from 50 billion euros (minimum estimates) to 1247 billion euros (maximum
    estimates); Losses until 2100 would be 2.5-3.1% of 2018 services under minimum
    valuation, or 6.8-8.3% under maximum valuation; Using the median, the 2018 value
    of ecosystem services would be 131 billion euros, or 26% of the baseline estimate;
    Future losses of ecosystem services would be 4-5% lower in 2050 under the lowest
    percentile of demographic growth, or 8-10% higher under the highest percentile.
  24: Under low demographic growth for all countries, ecosystem loss would be 25%-28%
    lower than the baseline (by 2100), or 7%-16% higher if demographic growth remains
    in the upper range of projections. Under median demographic scenario, ecosystem
    service loss would be only 2%-3% higher in 2050 and 3%-6% lower in 2100 than the
    baseline scenario.
  30: Analyzes the influence of different ecosystem service value aggregation methods
    in section 3.4, indicating that the uncertainty of this factor on relative loss
    is lower than for the uncertainty in coastal erosion projections. Study uses a
    constant price level of 2018.
  31: Future losses relative to GDP correlated with the relative value of services
    in 2018 (R^2 = 0.29 X 0.46) at regional level than relative loss of land (compared
    with the size of the coastal zone in 2018), which indicates R^2 of 0.21 X 0.28.
