Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climatic uncertainty and declining global wild fish stock.
  5: Unsustainable practices leading to declining fisheries stock; Climate change.
  7: Climate change adaptation scenarios simulated through changes in natural resource
    factors of production endowment, capital, and labor.
  8: Adoption of sustainable fishing practices (scenarios 1 and 2) as a way to enhance
    the natural resource endowment.
  9: Technological changes suggested from the research to enhance the economic situation
    of both consumers and producers of fish in the UAE. Specifically, 'sustainable
    practices' in the fisheries sector.
  10: Climate change requiring adaptation in the UAE fisheries sector.
  12: Scenarios 1 and 2, representing different levels of climate change impact.
Highlights:
  1: Sustainable practices in the fisheries sector (both hard and soft measures) will
    lead to price declines for fishery products, benefitting consumers. Producers
    will experience increased sales, offsetting losses from lower prices.
  7: Increasing the natural resource endowment of fisheries is important for increasing
    fish production in the UAE under climate change adaptation scenarios.
  8: Sustainable fishing practices reduce fish prices but increase the value-added
    of other related economic sectors. Sustainable practices spill over and benefit
    the consumer by lowering prices of fish substitutes. Efforts to preserve a sustainable
    natural resource endowment in the fisheries sector increase the demand for and
    prices of other factors of production.
  9: Sustainable practices in the UAE fisheries sector enhance the economic situation
    of both consumers and producers of fish. Consumers consume more fish and pay lower
    prices. Despite declining fish prices for producers, the overall impact on the
    UAE's food sector is positive.
  10: Adaptation in the UAE fisheries sector, through increased capital endowment
    and investment, leads to increased fish production and household consumption,
    and potentially lower prices for consumers.
  12: Significant decreases in the value of merchandise imports for fishing (-6.64%
    to -11.75%) with corresponding significant increases in the value of merchandise
    exports for fishing (13.48% to 25.77%). Increases in the value of merchandise
    exports of Red meat production, Meat products nec, Vegetable oils and fats, Dairy
    products, Processed rice, Sugar, Food products nec.
Methodology:
  1: Empirical UAE economic data and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model are
    used to perform the analysis. The results are applicable under assumed scenarios
    of adaptation measures.
  5: Applied the global Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model of the Global Trade
    Analysis Project (GTAP) with the GTAP database. The model assumes Constant Returns
    to Scale (CRS) and perfect competition. It also differentiates products by their
    economy of origin.
  7: Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model using GTAP data, varying supply elasticity
    of fisheries based on different fishing regimes (open access vs. private management).
  8: CGE (Computable General Equilibrium) model is used to simulate the impact of
    sustainable fishing practices on the UAE economy.
  9: The study uses a model with forward and backward linkages to capture direct and
    induced economic impacts on food sectors and impacts on both producers and consumers.
    Two policy scenarios are simulated.
  10: Economic modeling (not specified in detail, but mentions GTAP) used to simulate
    scenarios of enhanced capital endowment and investment in the fisheries sector.
More Notes:
  1: Fishermen may underinvest in sustainable adaptations, implying a role for the
    public sector.
  8: The analysis focuses on the UAE food sector, particularly fisheries and related
    industries.
  9: The base year for the analysis is 2012. The value of fish exports in 2012 was
    small ($31,000), while the value of fish imports was $47.5 million.
  10: Study acknowledges a limitation that fishermen are assumed to be profit maximizers
    and underinvest in climate change adaptation, requiring government intervention.
  12: The data distinguishes between CIF (Cost, Insurance, and Freight) for imports
    and FOB (Free On Board) for exports. 'nec' stands for 'not elsewhere considered'.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Changes in consumer and producer welfare in the UAE.
  5: Socio-economic consequences of changes in factors of production, production,
    consumption, and trade of all UAE relevant directly or indirectly connected to
    the UAE fisheries sector.
  7: Changes in production quantities of the UAE fisheries sector.
  8: Changes in real prices of production factors (land, labor, capital, natural resources);
    Changes in prices of fish and other commodities; Commodity output changes in various
    industries
  9: Changes in household demand for commodities, changes in merchandise trade, changes
    in prices paid by firms to production factors.
  10: Impacts on fish production, prices of production factors in the fisheries sector,
    and household consumption of domestically produced fish in the UAE.
  12: Changes in the value of merchandise imports (CIF) and exports (FOB) of various
    commodities.
Quantitative material:
  1: Prices of fishery products and related commodities will decline. Producers in
    all relevant directly and indirectly related economic sectors gain due to more
    sales. Returns to factors of production, such capital, and labor, also change.
  5: 'Two climate change adaptation scenarios are considered: A) increasing the fish
    stock available for fisheries by 15%; B) increasing the fish stock by 30% which
    assume increasing the capital endowment for the fisheries sector by 15% and the
    labor endowment by 5%.'
  7: Scenario 1 (15% increase in natural resource endowment) leads to a 7.8% increase
    in fish production. Scenario 2 (30% increase in natural resource endowment, 15%
    capital, 5% labor) leads to a 15.1% increase in fish production.
  8: Percentage changes in real prices of production factors under scenarios 1 and
    2 from the baseline (Table 2); Percentage decline in fish prices under scenarios
    1 and 2; Percentage decrease in prices of red meat and other meat products under
    scenarios 1 and 2; Change of 0.1% in the food processing sector (Figure 1).
  9: Fish exports increase by 13.48% (scenario 1) and 25.77% (scenario 2); Fish imports
    decrease by 6.64% (scenario 1) and 11.75% (scenario 2); Household demand for composite
    fish increases by 5.62% (scenario 1) and 10.57% (scenario 2); Household consumption
    of domestically produced fish increases by 9.12% (scenario 1) and 17.31% (scenario
    2); Household consumption of imported fish declines by 4.43% (scenario 1) and
    7.99% (scenario 2); Price paid to natural resources by firms declines by 38.7%
    (scenario 1) and 62.2% (scenario 2); Price of land increases by 1.1% (scenario
    1) and 1.2% (scenario 2).
  10: Fish production increases from a baseline of 72,700 tons in 2012 to 78,400 tons
    (7.8% increase) with a 15% increase in capital endowment, and to 83,700 tons (15.1%
    increase) with a 30% increase in capital endowment and 15% increase in capital
    investment and 5% increase in labor availability. Household consumption of domestically
    produced fish increases by 9.12% and 17.31% in scenario 1 and scenario 2, respectively.
  12: Percentage change from the baseline for the value of merchandise imports and
    exports across various commodities under two different scenarios.
