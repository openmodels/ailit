    and aims to facilitate access to and exploitation of information for policy making
    at different levels. It highlights main research gaps with emphasis on the interaction
    with and usability by the policy community.
  9: The EU Strategy on adaptation to climate change aims to shift the focus from
    understanding the problem to developing solutions and to move from planning to
    implementation, and calls for more data collection and data sharing on a wider
    range of topics including climate-related risks and losses, and health
  10: Focuses on the importance of adaptation strategies, international cooperation
    on adaptation, and the need for more accessible decision support systems for climate
    resilience.
  11: comprehensive review providing an up-to-date and forward-looking overview of
    models and tools for climate assessments; highlighting main research and policy

  16: No relevant information
  17: Adaptation assessment and modelling is moving from theoretical to applied, requiring
    modelling that supports informed decision-making. Adaptation does not involve
    a single quantitative objective and cannot be assessed with a single common metric.
    Adaptation involves complex temporal dimensions and high uncertainty related to
    various factors. Adaptation involves actions at different scales, and its benefits
    are difficult to model quantitatively.
  18: The page highlights the need for adaptation modeling to move beyond stylized
    approaches and integrate existing adaptation efforts, consider cross-sectoral
    interactions, and provide decision-makers with actionable information.
  19: The papers emphasize the importance of improving adaptation modelling for better
    decision-making, suggesting stress-testing, field experiments, and handling uncertainty.
  23: DICE implicitly considers adaptation in its aggregate damage function, while
    AD-DICE includes an explicit adaptation component. FUND introduces adaptation
    explicitly for some sectors and assumes autonomous adaptation for agriculture.
    PAGE models damages based on the difference between actual and tolerable temperature
    changes.
  24: Different IAMs handle adaptation differently, either implicitly or explicitly
    (reactive or pro-active). Adaptation measures can be separated into measures that
    act quickly (e.g. air conditioning) and precautionary measures (e.g. infrastructure).
    Adaptation can be extensive (installation of new equipment) or intensive.
  28: The GRACE model can be used to depict cross-sectoral and cross-regional interactions,
    integrate adaptation research into economic development projections, and assess
    trade-offs between climate change mitigation and adaptation policies.
  30: Adaptation in management and harvesting leads to positive economic impacts,
    turning potentially negative impacts from climate change into benefits for forestry
    sectors.
  31: Significant discrepancies exist between macroeconomic and micro-level impacts,
    with smallholders experiencing more than a two percent reduction in livelihood
    sources.
  32: Mechanization can partially offset the negative economic impacts of heat stress
    on worker productivity.
  33: Adaptation plays a key role in diminishing adverse impacts of climate change.
    Top-down and bottom-up approaches have complementary strengths that are not yet
    fully realized. There is a need for better integration of local climate impact
    studies into macroeconomic models and vice versa. Proactive adaptation is not
    well integrated under uncertainties into macroeconomic models.
  35: There's a need for a systematic assessment of the impacts of previous investments
    and of where and what type of investments could enhance the impacts in terms of
    informing action.
  36: Climate services can better inform decision-making by decision and policy makers
    in government, communities, civil society, businesses, industries, and for individuals,
    and are seen as having the potential to become ever-green enablers of smarter,
    systemic and timely climate action.
  40: The climate service market is broadening and deepening due to increasing demand
    for climate-resilient and low-carbon solutions; climate services need to specifically
    develop and focus products and services that directly inform and support solutions
    and actions.
  42: Storyline development helps in selecting relevant and credible pathways to enrich
    the understanding of risks and options at stake.
  43: Credible predictions of future conditions are severely constrained by unknown
    drivers and imperfect foresight capabilities.
  44: The Dutch climate change scenarios condense available global and regional climate
    change projections into four discrete narratives based on global warming level
    and regional atmospheric circulation response. These scenarios provide information
    on a range of meteorological characteristics tailored to sectoral stakeholders.
  45: Temperatures will continue to rise, resulting in milder winters and hotter summers.
    Increased precipitation in winter and more extreme precipitation events. Sea levels
    will continue to rise, causing higher tides and increased surge levels.
  48: Global sensitivity analysis strengthens stakeholder confidence in model projections
    and adaptation strategies.
  49: The paper highlights the difficulty of model validation, emphasizing that it
    is an incomplete and conditional assessment of a model's suitability. It also
    stresses the importance of considering the intended use of the model in the evaluation
    strategy.
  50: Global sensitivity analysis can reveal whether parameters adequately control
    model outputs, as seen in Butler et al. (2014) findings.
  52: Dominant drivers of coastal defense vulnerability change significantly over
    time, with wave setup being dominant up to 2050, and global climate change scenario
    only mattering beyond 2070. The controlling parameters for streamflow varied considerably
    across climatic gradients.
  53: Dominant modelled processes change along a climatic gradient. Sensitivity analysis
    can be applied regardless of whether observations of the system response are available
    or not, making it suitable for understanding the behavior of models under potential
    future conditions.
  54: Sensitivity analysis can be performed even on highly complex models or on those
    covering a global domain.
  56: Stress-testing helps establish conditions for trade-offs or failure of adaptation
    projects; Model simulations can overcome limitations of field experiments by applying
    credible climate changes.
  57: Advocates for adaptation planning that is integrated and mindful of multiple
    drivers of environmental change, avoiding "climate exceptionalism".
  58: Uncertainty should be embraced in adaptation planning. Robustness and resilience
    frameworks focus on testing decisions, targetting time and resources in productive
    ways. Robust decision making frameworks consist of management options, models
    of the system, performance metrics, and appraisal criteria. These frameworks are
    participatory and iterative, enabling shared understanding of vulnerabilities
    and goals.
  59: Adaptation measures should be low-regret, evidence-based, and deliver co-benefits.
    Long-term monitoring of drivers, well-defined trigger points, and monitoring of
    adaptation outcomes are crucial. Field trials are effective for obtaining evidence
    and demonstrating adaptations in practice.
  60: Riparian shade management can be an effective adaptation measure to keep rivers
    cool. The benefit of shade is greatest under hotter/drier/sunnier conditions.
    Cool refugia (e.g., spring flows) should be protected.
  61: Systems modelling offers another means of evaluating adaptation options plus
    scope for more comprehensive, integrated assessment of risks.
  62: Deep uncertainty about the future climate should not impede adaptation planning.
    Stress-testing systems under climate change can reveal adaptation efficacy and
    system vulnerabilities.

  65: The approach increases the probability of avoiding maladaptation and improves
    the applicability and assimilation of scientific results by users.
  68: By applying the EOA, adaptation options that initially seemed promising but
    had low confidence were discarded in favor of those with higher confidence, improving
    the range of effective adaptations.
  69: Recommends focusing on early and standard sowing dates combined with standard
    and longer cultivars for adaptation and recovery under moderate perturbations
    with high confidence. Short spring cultivars can be used for adaptation alone
    with high confidence. The study demonstrates that omitting the EOA analysis can
    lead to misleading adaptation recommendations.
  71: Risk is defined as the intersection of hazards, exposure, and vulnerability
    and is central to understanding climate change impacts.
  73: The proposed methodology can define a timeframe for the implementation of defined
    measures to optimise implementation costs while reducing the risk to the occupation
    and people.
  74: This paper presents and discusses models and approaches to test DRR measures
    and their effectiveness in minimising the impacts of coastal storms at occupied
    areas.
  75: Process-based models like XBeach can determine coastal erosion and flooding
    with great detail. XBeach coupled with LISFLOOD can be used for marine flooding.
    These models have extensive use and validation.
  76: DRR measures are assessed under both current and future climate conditions,
    emphasizing the importance of simulating scenarios with and without these measures
    to inform decision-making.
  77: Preparedness for climate change impacts can be higher with ex-ante DRR assessment,
    allowing for more effective solutions.
  78: The need for improved data access, increased interaction between scientists
    and end-users, and comprehensive cost-benefit analyses for DRR measures are highlighted.
    The importance of accounting for cascade effects of climate change impacts is
    also emphasized.
  81: 'Three significant challenges were identified: ensuring the salience and credibility
    of the modeling, exploring the capabilities and needs for improved models, and
    identifying critical thresholds and uncertainties.'
  83: Key suggestions for improving adaptation simulations include embracing scenario
    uncertainty, working with stakeholders, including advantageous adaptations, and
    integrating adaptation with mitigation policies.
  86: IRS analysis can be used to estimate regional risk of crop yield shortfall,
    and adaptation measures can modify impact thresholds.
  87: Climate change poses large risks of inflow decrease in the Vale do Gaio reservoir
    throughout the 21st century and increases the risk of water scarcity. Switching
    to crops with smaller water demand could increase the area under irrigation, but
    with enhanced sensitivity to rainfall changes. A national analysis of risk of
    yield shortfall might involve construction of equivalent likelihood curves for
    representative sites in different regions, and mapped for a given time period
    with the level of risk colour coded.
  90: Use of vegetation as a Nature-Based Solution (NBS) is increasingly being used
    for erosion protection and shallow landslide mitigation.
  91: "Thresholds for landslide triggering are affected by long-term precipitations\
    \ in areas covered by deep deposits of \uFB01ne-grained soils, while they are\
    \ controlled by short-term precipitations in areas with shallower deposits with\
    \ coarse-grained soils."
  92: More than 80 various landslide mitigation measures identified, focusing on rainfall-induced
    landslides, with approximately 15 measures involving nature-based solutions (NBS)
    or hybrid measures.
  93: NBS can represent a sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective approach to reduce
    societal risk associated with climate change and enhanced precipitation, especially
    related to landslides. NBS have been increasingly applied to design new resilient
    landscapes and cities with beneficial outcomes for the environment, the society
    and human well-being.
  94: 'Vegetation for landslide protection has positive effects: increased soil strength
    due to roots and reduced pore water pressure. It can have a negative effect by
    destabilizing slopes with strong winds (trees only).'
  95: The analysis incorporates vegetation (root and canopy characteristics) into
    slope stability modelling by affecting soil hydraulic properties and water fluxes
    to estimate pore water pressure and, ultimately, the safety factor for landslides.
  96: The use of vegetation for landslide risk mitigation needs more quantifiable
    documentation to effectively demonstrate its benefits in slope stability modelling.
  97: Identifies challenges in modeling vegetation effects on slope stability, including
    time-dependent vegetation features, species differences, and non-homogeneous distribution
    of vegetation.

    dependency on site conditions regarding climate change vulnerability.
  105: No relevant information
  106: Process-based, dynamic modelling is increasingly feasible for large-scale flood
    risk analyses due to improvements in computational power and data science.
  107: Effective adaptation including flood risk management has a high potential to
    counteract the effect of climate change, flood risk as well as its components
    are dynamic, risk-based decision-making requires understanding, quantifying and
    projecting changes in risk under an integrated systems framework
  109: The infographic highlights changes in hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and
    damage across different flood events, showing decreases or increases in these
    aspects over time.
  110: The page highlights the advancements in flood risk modeling using different
    approaches and emphasizes the need for advancing the quantification of changes
    in vulnerability related to human-flood dynamics.
  111: The RFM model simulates a 10,000-year spatially consistent meteorological series
    and river discharge series.
  112: Process-based modelling systems based on more detailed and comprehensive data
    should be developed and used for large-scale flood risk analyses.
  115: The benefits of urban climate information for end user communities was demonstrated
    considering services in diverse domains (Climate and Health, Building Energy,
    Emergency Planning, Urban Planning, Active Mobility, Tourism and Cultural Heritage)
    to improve decision-making and to help end users to better address the consequences
    of climate.
  116: Climate-fit.City demonstrates added value in terms of public service effectiveness,
    economic impacts, policy innovation, and social impacts; it also raises awareness
    about climate change.
  117: Climate-fit.City supports the development and adoption of adaptation strategies
    and actions plans by defining climate change risks through mapping and quantifying
    diverse impacts.
  119: Climate-Fit.City services demonstrate the use of urban pluvial flooding risk
    maps for climate change resilient emergency management and addresses impacts of
    heat on various sectors.
  121: Highlights include improved bike paths accommodating climate needs, reduction
    of deaths due to heat waves, health cost reduction, and support for updating building
    policies.
  122: No relevant information
  124: Weather-based insurance schemes can help overcome some of the losses in the
    agricultural sector due to climate change, and the accuracy of weather forecasts
    impacts farmers' income.
  126: WII can have a great impact on making access to insurances easier for farmers
    and can enhance the resilience of farming systems. The quality of weather index
    forecasts affects the optimal strategy for insurance policy buyers.
  127: Perfect weather forecasts lead to a steady increase in insured farmers, while
    imperfect forecasts lead to stable or decreasing numbers.
  128: Future droughts are expected to negatively impact agriculture, highlighting
    the importance of climate services.
  130: Advances in flood inundation modeling in data-scarce areas and the emergence
    of global flood models could form the foundation of global impact assessments.
  131: Recent innovations in global flood hazard mapping can support enhanced climate
    impact assessment.
  132: The TanDEM-X DEM has potential for more accurate flood simulation but requires
    vegetation bias removal.
  134: Mentions the upcoming surface water and ocean topography satellite mission
    as a source of data for larger rivers.
  135: Improvements in process representation and resolution have had substantial
    impacts on flood exposure estimation over large scales. Resolution and process
    inaccuracy tend to bias simulations towards greater exposure estimates.
  137: The socio-economic model is also able to capture the relationship between food
    demand, income levels and food prices; Water resource system simulators test the
    performance of the system under changing conditions of climate and demand.
  138: Contemporary climate risk models do not adequately capture sensitivities of
    cascading failure mechanisms across infrastructure networks; Socio-hydrological
    models help to overcome the gap in conventional hydroeconomic models by connecting
    economic and hydrological models; Only entire value chain related emission analysis
    fosters the needed transparency of emissions accounting; Insurance can reward
    risk reduction/adaptation.
  139: Insurance incentives encourage policyholders to protect property against extreme
    weather, and trade credit insurance can drive climate risk reduction.
  140: The paper highlights the need to better understand adaptation and the interaction
    between adaptation and mitigation in the land use and food system, an area receiving
    less attention compared to mitigation.
  141: LandSyMM integrates interactions between commodities consumption, land use
    management, vegetation and climate into a worldwide dynamic economic system. The
    global land use and food system has the capacity to respond and adapt to changes
    to the climate, and thereby reduce some of the negative consequences of these
    changes, while potentially creating additional challenges.
  142: Land-use modelling offers a unique chance to simulate the impacts of the adoption
    of land-based climate change mitigation measures, the role of the different actors
    along the food systems, the effect of the continuing globalization of trade in
    food products and increasing demand for agricultural goods.
  143: Changes in water resources as well as plant requirements under future climates
    can drive adaptation responses in land management.
  144: LandSyMM offers the opportunity to represent trade-offs, responses, and cross-scale
    and international interactions within a dynamic system; changing agricultural
    productivity could drive food substitutions in consumer choice; mitigation and
    adaptation to climate change do not always co-benefit.
  145: Land manager decisions are likely to minimize impact to market-based outputs,
    i.e. food and timber production, while potentially resulting in negative environmental
    consequences.
  146: The current implementation of LandSyMM provides a platform to better understand
    the interactions between land-based climate adaptation and mitigation.
  148: Recent advances in decision analysis and simulation modeling for climate adaptation
    in the water sector are being increasingly applied by practitioners.
  150: Climate models can be used to test possible future climatic conditions. Climate
    model outputs represent spatial and temporal dependencies between climatic variables
    that influence water resource systems (precipitation and evapotranspiration).
  151: The process has been applied in London to adapt the city's water supply system
    to climate change and population growth
  153: "intensifying calls for \u2018outcomes-based\u2019 management of water resources\
    \ and for reporting of climate-related risks are now providing a powerful motivator\
    \ for the wider adoption of these approaches."
  155: Framework for selecting adaptation measures at river basin level integrating
    economic efficiency, social acceptability, environmental sustainability, and adaptation
    robustness; obtains insights on using uncertain climate information for selecting
    robust, reliable, and resilient water management portfolios.
  156: Effective adaptation should combine both structural and non-structural measures,
    including regulatory and economic instruments. Selected adaptation is expected
    to be economically efficient, environmentally sustainable, socially acceptable,
    and robust.
  158: Local participation was key for developing an integrated vision of the evolution
    of agriculture and implications for water management in the context of SSPs and
    climate change conditions corresponding to RCP 8.5.
  161: The integrated framework facilitates the selection of adaptation measures that
    consider economic efficiency, social acceptability, environmental sustainability,
    and robustness.
  164: Recent technical, methodological, and tool-based advances in climate vulnerability,
    risk, and adaptation modeling of large-scale infrastructure networks are presented.
  167: "The ef\uFB01cacy of different types of adaptation options can be compared\
    \ and locations and assets with high (or low) adaptation bene\uFB01ts can be narrowed\
    \ down for further investigation."
  168: Transport networks in Vietnam and Argentina are increasingly exposed to severe
    and frequent extreme hazards, requiring significant investments to upgrade to
    higher climate-resilient design standards. Investing in climate resilience provides
    substantial benefits in avoiding risks and outweighs the investment costs, especially
    when considering longer disruption durations. These analyses provide scientific
    evidence for developing national climate-resilient transport strategies.
  170: Improvements needed in data collection on impact assessment elements. The focus
    is on improving hazard modeling, but there are opportunities for improvement in
    impact assessment analyses. Flood hazard models often based on coarse spatial
    scales and lack regional climate information. The identified BCRs of investing
    in climate adaptation of road assets.
  171: The key recommendation is to focus on data creation and sharing across several
    key areas of infrastructure, cascading failure mechanisms, indirect economic losses,
    and adaptation options.
  173: Emphasizes robustness in policymaking to handle deep uncertainty in human-water
    systems.
  175: The paper highlights the use of exploratory modeling to discover the implications
    of a priori knowledge and revise scenarios/policy adoption. It also emphasizes
    the use of ensemble models to sample uncertainty arising from parameter and structural
    uncertainties.
  176: Conventional hydroeconomic models fail to capture the interrelationships and
    two-way feedbacks between human and water systems that shape adaptive responses,
    leading to a poor understanding of policy- and climate-induced adaptation effects.
    Integrated approaches are needed to better understand the dynamics of complex
    adaptive human-water systems. Modularity offers potentially higher detail in the
    representation of each system and allows for the addition of non-linearity.
  177: The approach aims to identify futures where policies succeed or fail, explore
    tipping points, and inform the development of robust policies.
  178: The key concept is adaptive robustness, the ability to remove techno-institutional
    barriers and adapt policies as new information becomes available. Adaptive efficiency,
    the capacity of institutions to solve complex dilemmas over long periods, is also
    important. Understanding past transaction costs can inform the development of
    adaptively robust institutions.
  179: Adaptive efficiency is linked to meeting objectives, minimizing transaction
    costs, and adequate program budgets. Techno-institutional lock-in can constrain
    future policy options. Water resource management is particularly susceptible to
    engineering-based policy lock-in due to large investments and infrastructure lifespans.
  181: Application of the research framework will provide new insights for water policy
    as well as for the broader sphere of sustainable development. Policymakers in
    these spheres need to be aware of trade-offs and distributive implications of
    adaptation policies in the water sector.
  183: Adaptation to climate change poses physical and transitional risks to the private
    sector, but also presents opportunities for innovation and development.
  184: This paper addresses transitional risks associated with climate change, focusing
    on how they affect the private sector. Transitional risks are systemic societal
    responses to climate change, such as increased CO2 pricing and changing demands
    from investors and consumers.
  185: GHG accounting and reporting are moving from an area of relatively lower importance
    within companies to a higher degree of concern and a risk that needs to be assessed
    and managed in the same way as other significant risks.
  186: It is emphasized that Scope 3 emissions, which encompass value chain emissions,
    often represent the largest portion of a company's GHG impacts, suggesting the
    importance of including these in science-based targets for accuracy and compliance
    with the Paris Agreement.
  187: Collaboration is key up and down the value chain for positive feedback in reducing
    emissions.
  188: Process-based approaches provide the greatest resolution for incorporating
    science-based targets and aligning with the Paris Agreement goals.
  189: Projections show strategic efforts to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, with
    a 55% reduction target by that year.
  191: Insurers can contribute to climate change adaptation by including risk reduction
    measures in insurance products, which helps to better adapt to climate change
    by not only transferring the risk but by directly reducing avoidable damages when
    an event strikes.
  192: Insurers can contribute to climate change adaptation through underwriting and
    pricing practices. Premium discounts can incentivize policyholders to implement
    adaptation measures.
  193: Flood-resilience technologies (e.g., elevating a house) can significantly reduce
    flood damage and insurance premiums.  A house elevated one foot above BFE can
    see premium reductions of more than 80% in A zones and more than 60% in V zones.
  194: There is a significant protection gap for BI risks. Risk transfer alone will
    not be sufficient to ensure sustainable insurance coverage. BI can be the most
    important variable in the survival of a business after a natural catastrophe.
    Standard BI insurance may not be broad enough considering damage to the wider
    area after a natural catastrophe.
  196: Mortgage delinquency rates increased significantly in FEMA counties following
    a disaster, even for homes with no physical damage. This suggests broader economic
    impacts beyond direct property damage. Adaptation measures in property insurance
    and NDBI insurance can reduce insured risk.
  197: Insurers can contribute to climate change adaptation through underwriting and
    pricing practices by integrating prevention measures to mitigate insured risk.
  199: Societal transformation approaches used during the COVID-19 pandemic may be
    applicable to climate change adaptation; European Commission funding will support
    research and innovation in climate adaptation, including societal transformation.

  204: The page highlights the importance of understanding existing policies, identifying
    gaps and opportunities, focusing resources, and engaging in detailed monitoring
    and evaluation to assess the impact of interventions.
  209: The EU's adaptation strategy focuses on supporting better-informed decision-making
    on climate adaptation across multiple governance levels with an emphasis on being
    smarter, faster, more systemic, and increasing international action.
  212: Integration of changing exposure and vulnerability is needed for realistic
    climate risk projections. Risk metrics alone are not sufficient to predict adaptation
    outcomes; they must be placed in the local context. Current climate risk products
    may fall short of informing adaptation decision-making.
  214: Socio-economic developments amplify the impacts from changes in climate and
    are essential to include in risk assessments. Failing to account for changes in
    exposure and vulnerability can lead to underestimates of future risk. Changes
    in vulnerability, or sensitivity, due to extreme weather events also shape past
    impacts.
  215: "Mortality rates from storm surge floods have substantially declined in most\
    \ world regions despite increasing coastal populations, sea-level rise, and land\
    \ subsidence. The highest risk of death from storm surge flooding today is located\
    \ in the Paci\uFB01c and Southeast Asia."
  216: Stresses the importance of accounting for changes in vulnerability to avoid
    overemphasizing the effects of (additional) adaptation measures.
  217: The paper highlights the need to acknowledge past trends of exposure and vulnerability,
    understand reductions in vulnerability from adaptation measures, tailor impact
    metrics to local situations, and use bottom-up studies to assess risks of residual
    losses and damages.
  220: The impact chain method has been perceived as (1) an appropriate means for
    risk analysis, (2) a useful tool for communication of complex cause-effect relationships
    in climate change impacts and risks, and (3) a great approach to identify entry
    points for adaptation measures.
  221: Adaptation strategies can reduce climate risks by reducing vulnerabilities
    and exposure or by mitigating the climate-hazard itself.
  222: The framework suggests strategies to reduce risk by targeting the hazards,
    vulnerabilities, and exposure.
  223: Vulnerability and exposure factors are complex, context-specific, and partly
    intangible. Critical system elements can be revealed through participatory approaches,
    such as insufficiently maintained flood protection infrastructure or informal
    settlements in flood zones.
  224: The main highlight is the use of impact chains for risk assessment, combining
    quantitative and qualitative data, and prioritizing a comprehensive understanding
    of vulnerabilities even with limited data. It also emphasizes the importance of
    transparency and comparability when using indicator-based approaches.
  225: Identifies flood risk drivers and proposes interventions like wetland restoration,
    reforestation, capacity building, and urban planning.
  226: Impact chains are a useful tool for analysis and communication of complex cause-effect
    relationships. The participatory approach is highly valued to obtain a structured
    and agreed picture of context-specific climate risks. The methodology can highlight
    impacting mechanisms related to hazards and pinpoint causal relationships. Risk
    assessment is a value-based approach that depends on priorities, values, targets
    and normative settings.
  228: An operational approach to include consideration of global change drivers in
    support of the design of local policies or investment plans; identification of
    preferable solutions in terms of technical performances, acceptance by stakeholders,
    cost-benefit ratio; a general methodological framework for including climate considerations
    in decision/policy making.
  229: Decision makers are increasingly including climate risks in medium to long-term
    decisions across policy, financial, and economic activities.
  230: Robust solutions are those that show limited failure across numerous potential
    future conditions, as opposed to optimal solutions under past trends.
  232: The approach aims to gain a better understanding of possible future alternatives
    to assess the robustness of different decisions within a wide range of plausible
    futures. Participatory scenarios are used to stimulate local actors, create integrated
    images of the future, and ensure multiple skills and subjective interpretations
    are taken into account.
  237: JPI Climate aims to connect research, performers and funders across Europe
    to promote the creation of new knowledge in the natural and anthropogenic climate
    change domain.
  238: JPI Climate aims to connect climate change risk and adaptation knowledge with
    decision-making at different scales; aims to promote cross-boundary, cross-community
    research to improve coherence, integration and robustness of climate impact research
    and connect it to societal needs.

    aggregate damage functions, explicit cost-benefit analysis for sector-specific
    adaptations, and the introduction of tolerable temperature changes.
  24: The paper reviews properties of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) including
    Cost-Benefit IAMs (CB-IAM) and Policy-Evaluation Models (PEM). CB-IAMs weigh mitigation
    costs against benefits of reducing climate damages. PEMs assess mitigation costs
    for a predefined mitigation target. The analysis looks at how different IAMs handle
    damage functions, adaptation, and geoengineering.
  27: The analysis is performed using top-down approaches such as multi-region, multi-sector

    through cross-sectoral and cross-regional interactions.
  28: The paper describes the GRACE model, a global computable general equilibrium
    (CGE) model calibrated using the GTAP database, which uses national accounts data
    to model the flow of goods and services between production sectors and final consumption,
    considering inputs like labor, capital, and natural resources; it models regional
    and sectoral aggregation with flexible scope; the model finds the combination
    of prices and quantities under the assumption of market equilibrium.
  30: The GRACE model with a modified module for forest management is used to assess
    economic consequences, where standing biomass is interpreted as wealth and harvesting
    as its return.
  31: Analysis involves macroeconomic assessment using GRACE and a local assessment
    using interviews with smallholders.
  32: The authors implement autonomous adaptation in the GRACE model, such as penetration
    of air conditioners and mechanization of outdoor work in agriculture and construction,
    which were linked to different SSPs. Projections of mechanization for different
    SSPs were extrapolated based on a regression analysis, where the number of tractors
    per hectare was used as a proxy for mechanization and GDP per capita as an explanatory
    variable.
  33: Compares and contrasts top-down (CGE models) and bottom-up modeling approaches

    chains, consistent with the IPCC AR5 concept on climate risk. Impact chains are
    used for the selection of appropriate models, indicators or guide more qualitative,
    expert-based assessments.
