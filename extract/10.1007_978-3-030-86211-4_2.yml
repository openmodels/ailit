    trends (based on SSPs).
  88: No relevant information
  100: Increase in frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves, and an increase
    in the probability of multiple adverse climate events during growing seasons.
  108: Flood hazard due to climate change, exposure, and vulnerability are primary
    drivers of flood risk; Societal change and economic development increase flood
    damage; human interventions such as flood protection influence risk; building
    materials and construction methods can affect vulnerability and increase average
    building losses.
  109: Precipitation and hydrological conditions, protection failures, settlement
    patterns and economic exposures, lack of awareness, preparedness, and insufficient
    organizational structures.

  124: Climate change, specifically temperature increases leading to drought, impacts
    agricultural yields.
  125: Climate-related risks such as reduced agricultural yields and climate extremes.
  126: Heavy rains, heat waves, drought.
  127: Imperfect weather forecasts lead to stable or decreasing numbers of insured
    farmers.
  128: Changing climate leading to more frequent and severe droughts, quality of weather
    forecasts (perfect vs. imperfect).
  138: Weather- and climate-related extremes; Cascading failure mechanisms across
    infrastructure networks; Market and technology shifts, loss of reputation and
    policy and legal challenges (transitional risks).
  140: Climate change, growing populations, economic shocks.
  141: Changes in climate (temperature, precipitation, atmospheric greenhouse gas
    concentrations) and land management practices.
  144: Shocks such as floods, droughts, yield shocks, price shocks, pandemics, and
    cyber-attacks impact food systems under climate change pressure.
  145: Shift in the 5th percentile of annual surface runoff (drought risk); Shift
    in the 95th percentile of monthly surface runoff (flood risk); Expansion of agriculture

    to reduced water availability and increased drought intensity, magnitude, and
    duration.
  165: Climate-change driven hazards impacting infrastructure networks (energy, transport,
    water, waste, telecommunications).
  168: Failures of key network links exposed to climate hazards (floods, cyclones,
    landslides), increased frequency and severity of extreme hazards
  169: Spatial network vulnerabilities and risks due to climate-related hazards.
  170: Focus is given on improving hazard modeling due to variability and limitations
    in Global Climate Model scenarios, which impact climate risk assessments.
  173: Water demand is expected to outstrip supply due to climate change, population
    growth, and changing distributions of wealth.
  177: "Climate change scenarios, policy scenarios, modeling limitations (\u03B51),\
    \ unawareness (\u03B52 - consequences of a priori unknowns)."
  184: Transitional risks such as CO2 pricing, taxes, and novel demands from investors
    and customers.
  185: Policy changes, GHG emission reduction demands, and transition risks in the
    private sector impacting economic investments in low-carbon assets.
  191: More common extreme weather events could make insurance unaffordable or unavailable
    for individuals and businesses.
  193: Flood depth, leading to increased damage; lack of flood resilience technologies.
  194: Natural disasters; damage to structures and their contents; non-damage BI (NDBI)
    where businesses are unable to operate even if not directly impacted by property
    damage.
  196: Natural catastrophes (unspecified, but correlated with FEMA county designations)
    impacting property and business operations.
  197: Climate change
  209: Climate change
  212: Climatic and non-climatic drivers; changing exposure and vulnerability.
  215: Storm surge floods, increasing coastal population, sea-level rise, land subsidence.
  216: Climate impacts varying greatly over a population based on development status,
    income, and other capacities; Limited capacities to deal with impacts from climatic
    hazards.
  217: Climate change impacts exceeding adaptation capacities; Dynamics of autonomous
    risk processes not sufficiently included in impact modelling; Insufficient consideration
    of equity in risk assessment; Local capacities, preferences, and governance hindering
    adaptation implementation.
  220: "Current climate extremes and scenarios of future climate, analysis, which\
    \ other underling factors and trends (ecosystem related, physical, technical,\
    \ or socio-economic factors) are in\uFB02uencing climate risks"
  221: Climate extremes and climate change are drivers of risk, interacting with exposure
    and vulnerability to create specific climate risks like drought damage in agriculture.
  223: Heavy rain events, urbanization, aging population, wetland degradation, deforestation,
    lack of urban planning, absence of flood-resistant housing
  229: Altered frequencies and magnitude of climate-related phenomena (e.g., droughts,
    storms, floods), evolution of markets and policies on different scales.
  230: Multiple drivers with deep unpredictability.
  233: Climate change drivers are considered jointly with socio-economic ones.
  243: Storm surge floods in different world regions.
Highlights:
  10: The importance and wide scope of 'adaptation modeling' is emphasized.
  17: Adaptation does not involve a single quantitative objective and it cannot be
    assessed with a single common metric that applies to all risks and sectors.
  22: IAMs have evolved over time to incorporate climate catastrophes and adaptation,
    but adaptation modelling is complex due to sector-specific measures, regional
    vulnerabilities, and societal choices.
  23: DICE implicitly considers adaptation in aggregate damages, AD-DICE explicitly
    considers adaptation in the damage function; FUND includes explicit cost-benefit
    analysis for coastal protection, and PAGE sets a tolerable temperature influenced
    by costly adaptation measures.
  27: The page highlights the importance of cross-sectoral interactions and interdependencies
    when assessing the economic impacts of climate change and adaptation.
  29: RCP4.5 may represent an optimal global strategy for stabilizing long-term climate
    impacts.
  30: Climate change leads to a reduction in the value added from forests world-wide
    if based on physical assessment alone and without adaptation. Price effects and
    resulting adaptation related to the management turns the impacts on the value
    of forests positive. Adaptation related to the harvesting further increases the
    positive economic impacts.
  31: Constraints related to farm size limit adaptation, leading to a greater impact
    on smallholders than the macroeconomic analysis suggests; there's a discrepancy
    in impacts measured at the macro and micro levels.
  32: Heat-induced reductions in worker productivity lead to a 1.4% GDP decline under
    RCP8.5 by 2100, which is 0.4 percentage points less than without autonomous mechanization.
  33: Complementarity of top-down and bottom-up approaches not yet fully realized;
    need for better integration of proactive adaptation into macroeconomic models.
  34: Highlights the economic costs of heat-induced reductions in worker productivity.
  39: Recognition of the need to enhance climate service sector and improve coordination
    at the European level.
  40: Increased focus on climate services supporting solutions and actions, particularly
    evident in the European Green Deal and EU Horizon Europe missions; The need for
    climate services to directly inform and support solutions and actions; The importance
    of climate services for achieving broader climate-related missions.
  44: No relevant information.
  48: Comparison with historical observations alone is insufficient for validating
    climate change impact models. Global sensitivity analysis can enhance model evaluation,
    transparency, and robustness. Improved model evaluation can strengthen stakeholder
    confidence in model projections and derived adaptation strategies.
  51: Global climate change scenarios only matter for long-term planning while local
    factors such as near-shore coastal bathymetry dominated in the short and mid-term
    (~over the next 50 years).
  52: Dominant drivers of coastal defence vulnerability change over time, with wave
    setup being the dominant factor until 2050, after which other factors like climate
    change scenarios become more significant.
  56: Model simulations can apply credible climate changes to overcome the limitation
    of field-based stress-testing that may not represent future extreme weather conditions.
  58: Robustness and resilience frameworks focus on identifying conditions with trade-offs
    or break-points in performance for decision testing.
  66: Efforts are required to reduce uncertainty in climate projections, especially
    for agriculture.
  76: Models can evaluate how effective DRR measures, or combinations thereof, are
    in reducing the impact of storm events. The process involves assessing risks under
    current conditions and under climate change scenarios, with and without DRR measures.
  78: Need for cost-benefit analysis, including ecosystem services, to ensure DRR
    measures are effective and less costly; Need to account for indirect impacts and
    cascade effects, such as economic disruption from increased coastal flooding
  88: The model-based approach to risk assessment is advantageous because it can be
    updated as new scenarios emerge without re-running the underlying impact models.
  100: Adaptation of agricultural production systems is required to minimize yield
    loss risk and exploit new opportunities from changing climatic conditions.
  108: An observed reduction in flood impacts was driven mainly by reductions in vulnerability;
    Integrated flood risk management can positively influence vulnerability.
  109: The study identifies key drivers of change in flood risk, fatalities, and economic
    losses by comparing paired flood events across different geographic locations.
  115: The Climate-fit.City service provides the best available scientific urban climate
    data and information to improve decision-making and help end users to better address
    the consequences of climate.
  121: Urban climate services can provide scientific support (maps, data, climate
    scenarios) for potential improvement of the effectiveness into a range of public
    services and development of evidence-based urban policies. The Climate-fit.City
    service provides an integrated service that enables the streamlining of the application
    of multiple sectoral services.
  124: Weather-based insurance schemes (WII) can help overcome some of the losses
    in the agricultural sector due to climate change.
  125: Weather-Based Index Insurance could promote resilience in farming systems,
    support zero hunger (SDG 2), reduce inequalities (SDG 10), and advance climate
    action (SDG 13).
  126: WII can have a great impact on making access to insurance easier for farmers
    and enhance the resilience of farming systems.
  127: Adverse selection in WII can occur when only policy buyers, but not insurers,
    use weather index forecasts for decision-making.
  128: Perfect forecasts lead to higher income variability with occasional significant
    increases, 'always insurance' provides more stable income, and imperfect forecasts
    result in frequent fluctuations with generally lower income.
  138: Climate risk models often do not adequately account for cascading failure mechanisms
    across infrastructure networks; Socio-hydrological models overcome the gap of
    conventional hydroeconomic models.
  140: Focuses on the interaction between adaptation and mitigation in the land use
    and food system, an area that has received less emphasis than land-based climate
    change mitigation.
  141: LandSyMM can be used for climate adaptation assessment by taking into account
    the impacts of climate change and land management on crop yields, land allocation,
    food security, and trade.
  145: LandSyMM can inform policymakers on the trade-offs between different policy
    options as well as the impact on various aspects of the food system (e.g. production,
    international trade and diets)
  160: High uncertainty in future water availability due to variability across GCM/RCM
    model combinations. Spatial variability of climate change impacts, with temperature
    increase and precipitation decrease expected to be higher in the upper basin.
    Economically efficient adaptation is defined by integrating hydrologic, engineering,
    environmental, and economic aspects of water resource systems.
  165: Focus on building data-driven models for identifying spatial network vulnerabilities
    and risks to support decision-making; discussing how questions related to network
    exposure, vulnerabilities, and adaptation strategies are being answered with generalized
    methodologies supported by data-driven case studies.
  167: The methodology aims to create a high-level screening to compare the efficacy
    of different adaptation options and narrow down locations and assets with high
    (or low) adaptation benefits for further investigation. This information is useful
    for narrowing down the locations of risks at a country scale, which should be
    followed by detailed site-specific investigations.
  168: Transport networks in Vietnam and Argentina are increasingly exposed to more
    severe and frequent extreme hazards, requiring significant investments to upgrade
    to higher climate-resilient design standards. Adaptation investments yield substantial
    cumulative benefits over time, outweighing the costs.
  169: Network analyses are becoming more prevalent and achievable because more data
    on spatial hazards, spatial assets and network topologies, customer and economic
    usage are becoming available, aiding in infrastructure planning and investment
    decisions.
  170: The emphasis on enhancing hazard modeling and the need for improved data in
    risk visualization tools for infrastructure networks.
  173: The paper emphasizes the need for policies that are robust to foreseeable and
    unforeseen changes in conditions.
  174: Standard decision-making based on a complete probabilistic description of future
    conditions is no longer appropriate; instead, priority should be given to robustness.
    Integration among disciplines remains weak and allows only for fractioned understanding
    and partial representation of uncertainty.
  177: Identifies futures where policies meet or miss objectives, explores potential
    tipping points, informs the development of robust policies that show a satisfactory
    performance under most conceivable futures; Deep uncertainty type 2 (unawareness)
    persists until empirically revealed.
  180: 'Three major recommendations for future scientific work and research: development
    of a flexible and interdisciplinary modular hierarchy for multi-system ensembles;
    effort to gather longitudinal transaction cost data to create a database for analysis;
    integration of stakeholders in the generation of methods and results.'
  184: Transitional risks pose both challenges and opportunities for businesses, requiring
    adaptation to new market conditions and potentially enhancing reputation and brand
    value.
  185: Transition risks must be expected in the private sector and sustainable finance
    action plans and the European taxonomy on sustainable finance are vehicles for
    the Green Deal by steering finance in a direction to economic investments in low-carbon
    assets.
  191: Including risk reduction measures in an insurance product has the advantage
    of helping to better adapt to climate change by not only transferring the risk
    but by directly reducing avoidable damages when an event strikes, which as a result
    contributes to build a more resilient society.
  193: Flood-resilience measures (e.g., elevating a house) can significantly reduce
    insurance premiums in flood-prone areas. The example provides quantitative estimates
    of the cost of risk reduction versus premium reduction.
  194: There is a significant protection gap for BI risks, necessitating improved
    modeling and extended insurance coverage, including risk reduction measures; risk
    transfer alone is insufficient for sustainable insurance coverage.
  196: Property insurance and NDBI insurance, as well as business contingency planning,
    can reduce insured risk and vulnerability to payment defaults arising from climate
    change. Credit insurers can support insured parties with risk assessment and improve
    their own risk assessment based on regional and global climate change impacts.
    Adaptation measures aimed at protecting property against physical damages may
    lower delinquency rates on mortgages on damaged homes, and adaptation measures
    to improve business contingency planning to climate change scenarios may reduce
    mortgage delinquency rates more broadly.
  197: Insurers can contribute to climate change adaptation through underwriting and
    pricing practices by including prevention measures to mitigate the insured risk.
  209: Many models provide information with a spatial-temporal resolution too coarse
    for many adaptation policy decisions, particularly at the urban, municipal level.
  212: Integration of information on changing exposure and vulnerability is needed
    to make projections of future climate risk more realistic; risk metrics alone
    are not sufficient to predict adaptation outcomes and must be placed in the local
    context.
  215: Mortality rates from storm surge floods have substantially declined in most
    world regions between 1900 and 2013, despite increasing coastal populations, sea-level
    rise, and land subsidence. The highest risk of death from storm surge flooding
    is located in the Pacific and Southeast Asia.
  216: Changes in vulnerability should be accounted for in risk projections to avoid
    overemphasizing the effect of adaptation measures; High risks may indicate the
    need for additional adaptation measures to protect vulnerable populations; Adaptation
    action can be limited by local capacities, leading to soft adaptation limits.
  217: Current climate risk products may fall short on informing adaptation decision-making
    due to insufficient inclusion of autonomous risk processes, equity considerations,
    and adaptation limits.
  220: Impact chains are (1) an appropriate means for risk analysis, (2) a useful
    tool for communication of complex cause-effect relationships in climate change
    impacts and risks, and (3) a great approach to identify entry points for adaptation
    measures.
  221: Climate impact chains, originally developed for climate risk assessments in
    the European Alps, have been applied in almost twenty national climate risk assessments
    worldwide and are proposed by the new ISO 14091 as one of the concepts for climate
    risk assessments.
  223: Vulnerability and exposure factors are predominantly complex, strongly context
    specific and partly intangible.
  226: Impact chains highlight impacting mechanisms related to different hazards on
    complex and heterogeneous socio-ecological systems, pinpointing causal relationships,
    and relevant factors over a broad spectrum of vulnerability facets.
  228: The paper aims to present an operational approach to include consideration
    of global change drivers in the design of local policies or investment plans,
    focusing on identifying preferable solutions in a medium-term perspective (10-40
    years) under uncertainty.
  229: Climate risks need to be included in medium to long-term decisions in the policy
    sector and in financial and economic activities.
  233: Decision making for climate change adaptation is affected by deep uncertainty.
    Outputs of modelling exercises need to be integrated with other sources of knowledge
    and implemented within an integrated platform for decision support.
  243: Changes in average event mortality for storm surge floods across different
    world regions between 1900 and 2013, showing regional variations in mortality
    rates over time.
Methodology:
  10: The paper references the use of adaptation modeling and technical, financial,
    economic, and non-monetary analysis to support decision-making but does not detail
    methodology.
  17: Adaptation modelling involves complex temporal dimensions, addressing impacts
    that vary dynamically and non-linearly over time, and consideration of risk and
    uncertainty, often requiring extended decision support methods.
  22: Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are used, including Optimal Growth models,
    Cross-sectoral policy optimization, and Policy Evaluation models (Cost minimization,
    CGE, PE). Evolution of IAMs from 'basic models' to those incorporating climate
    catastrophes and modularized, open-source approaches (MIMI models). Adaptation
    modelling uses cost-benefit approaches.
  23: Different IAMs like DICE, FUND, and PAGE incorporate adaptation in various ways;
    some use implicit adaptation in damage functions, while others extend to explicit
    cost-benefit analysis.
  27: The paper discusses bottom-up approaches focusing on local impacts and top-down
    approaches using multi-region, multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE)
    models. It also mentions the macroeconomic model GRACE, which is based on a standard
    description of relationships between economic activities in countries.
  29: GRACE model assesses economic development impacts using standardized economic
    indicators without policy mitigation.
  30: 'The study uses the GRACE model with a modified module for forest management.
    The standing biomass is interpreted as wealth, and harvesting is interpreted as
    the return of this wealth. Three scenarios of economic impacts are analyzed: no
    adaptation, adaptation in management, and adaptation in management and harvesting.
    Applicable to 27 countries. The analysis estimates the economic consequences of
    climate change on the biomass in forests based on physical estimates, which included
    adaptation in the utilization of forests and resulting market effects.'
  31: Macroeconomic impacts are assessed using the GRACE model with productivity impacts
    quantified based on a meta-study; household impacts are studied through interviews
    and data collection from a local community in Nepal.
  32: Economic impact assessment using the GRACE model, implementing autonomous adaptation
    (air conditioners, mechanization linked to SSPs). Mechanization projections extrapolated
    based on a regression analysis using tractors per hectare as a proxy and GDP per
    capita as an explanatory variable.
  33: Combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches needed; modeling involves CGE
    models and local insights.
  34: The GRACE model is used in some analyses. The GTAP data base (Verions 10) is
    used in some analyses.
  39: No relevant information
  40: Assessment of the climate service market, including demand and supply, and the
    ability of climate products and services to support climate action.
  44: Aggregation of climate model simulations focused on meteorological characteristics
    tailored to sectoral stakeholders.
  48: Impact models that translate potential future climate conditions into variables
    of interest (e.g., drought or flood risk). Global sensitivity analysis for model
    evaluation, including assessing parameter control over model output, robustness
    to input uncertainties, relevance of model assumptions, and how modelled environmental
    processes change with climatic boundary conditions. Traditional model validation
    relies on comparison with historical observations.
  51: Global sensitivity analysis is used to determine the factors that most strongly
    control the vulnerability of coastal flood defenses over time.
  52: Uses global sensitivity analysis (GSA) to assess the influence of various factors
    over time on coastal defence vulnerability.
  56: Stress-testing should include monitoring, evaluation, and learning to benchmark
    benefits and confirm expected outcomes.
  57: Evaluating adaptation performance through 'stress-testing' using credible climate
    and non-climate scenarios; field experiments; systems modelling.
  58: The frameworks are participatory and iterative, enabling shared understanding
    between managers and analysts of vulnerabilities and adaptation goals.
  63: Stress-testing options with competent authorities and stakeholders; field experimentation
    with observable adaptation outcomes under extreme weather or controlled laboratory
    conditions; systems modelling credibility depends on plausible narratives of change;
    strong counterfactuals are needed to assess outcomes; long-term monitoring, evaluation
    and learning to benchmark performance metrics and to confirm that expected project
    outcomes are achieved.
  66: The analysis uses observed climate data combined with Euro-CORDEX RCMs simulations
    for a sensitivity analysis in agricultural climate projections.
  73: Presents a generic approach to model disaster risk reduction measures at coastal
    areas, including climate change effects. The methodology is adaptable to any coastal
    region and can be used to test (and improve) management options. It can also be
    used to define a timeframe for the implementation of defined measures.
  76: Uses models to simulate and evaluate the effectiveness of Disaster Risk Reduction
    (DRR) measures under storm conditions and climate change by simulating historical
    and climate change-related storm scenarios with and without DRR measures. This
    allows for predictions of local flooding and erosion, which are then combined
    with local population, built environment, and infrastructure characteristics to
    compute storm impact and the effectiveness of the DRR measures. The approach differentiates
    between 'exposure-reducing measures' and 'pathway-obstructing measures', requiring
    different modelling approaches.
  78: Process-based models for DRR measures; Historical analysis of damage from past
    events as learning lessons; Cost-benefit analysis
  85: The paper outlines an approach using impact models and Impact Response Surfaces
    (IRSs) to evaluate climate change risks and adaptation strategies. IRSs depict
    the response of an impact variable to changes in two explanatory variables, allowing
    for a 'scenario-neutral' analysis of impacts.
  88: The paper discusses a 'model-based approach to risk assessment' that can be
    updated with new scenarios without re-running underlying impact models. The approach
    is tested in five sectors at a national scale in Finland.
  108: Analysis of paired event case studies; Temporal trend analyses on flood damage
    data; Modelling approaches that consider drivers of risk along with their interactions
    and feedbacks.
  109: The analysis compares paired flood events to identify changes in pre-conditions,
    hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and damage over time, using arrows as indicators
    of change. The methods being reviewed are stylized models (SYMs), system-of-systems
    models (SSMs) and agent-based models (ABMs), noting that their implementation
    is influenced by the spatial scale of risk assessment, availability of expert
    knowledge and empirical data.
  115: The Climate-fit.City service provides urban climate data and information to
    public and private end users operating in cities. The benefits of this information
    for end user communities are demonstrated through diverse domains, including Climate
    and Health, Building Energy, Emergency Planning, Urban Planning, Active Mobility,
    Tourism and Cultural Heritage.
  118: The Climate-fit.City service uses downscaled climate information at the city
    scale. VITO uses the UrbClim model for heat stress, and KU Leuven applies rainfall
    downscaling statistics for precipitation and flooding. UrbClim consists of a land
    surface scheme coupled to a 3D atmospheric boundary layer module, set up with
    a spatial resolution of 100 m, driven by meteorological data from the Copernicus
    Climate Change Service.
  119: Statistical downscaling of climate model outputs to local city scale; Perturbation
    of local time series of measured precipitation intensity according to climate
    change signals; Co-design of services with urban end users

    methods specific to each demonstration case within the Climate-fit.city project.
    Urban climate data delivery using satellite-based land cover, building, soil and
    vegetation data.
  124: Presents weather-based insurance schemes (WII) based on weather index objectively
    determined for specific agricultural region and analysis of the results of decisions
    based on perfect and imperfect weather forecasts.
  125: Implementation of Weather-Based Index Insurance which provides payouts based
    on predefined weather indexes and eliminates the need for individual loss assessment.
  126: Theoretical modelling of Weather Index Insurance (WII) schemes, simulating
    the dynamics of aggregate demand for WII, modelling strategies of producers in
    drought-prone regions regarding WII policy purchase.
  127: Conceptual model for Weather Index Insurance (WII) using a simple power law
    for crop yield dependence on the weather index and a simple random process for
    the dynamics of actual and forecasted weather index.
  128: Simulation using a simple Weather Index Insurance (WII) model with a stationary
    random process for weather indices, considering the impact of different forecast
    qualities and insurance strategies on producer income. Suggests generalizing to
    non-stationary random processes to account for climate change trends.

    between climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies and their impacts
    on the land and food system.
  141: The paper introduces the Land System Modular Model (LandSyMM), a coupled model
    that integrates commodities consumption, land use management, vegetation, and
    climate into a worldwide dynamic economic system to simulate the global food system
    and socio-economic development over long-term predictions.
  144: The study uses the LandSyMM approach to dynamically model interactions within
    land systems including trade-offs and responses to climate adaptation and mitigation.
  145: "LandSyMM is used to explore climate adaptation via different scenarios underpinning\
    \ climate change; Scenarios explore different futures such as different levels\
    \ of economic growth, population demographics, international trade regimes, and\
    \ dietary preferences; The shift in runoff is calculated between the predicted\
    \ values of 2071\u20132100 and 1971\u20132000"
  160: Uses climate scenarios downscaled from GCMs as input to hydrological models
    to simulate impacts on available resources and agro-climatic models. Integrates
    top-down (climate projections) and bottom-up (adaptation measures) approaches
    into a water management model (DSS), specifically a hydroeconomic model, to define
    adaptation strategies. Optimization is used to select the most cost-efficient
    combination of adaptation measures for future scenarios.

  185: Companies are using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) (GHG 2020a,
    b) to assess and report their climate risks, although the methods need to become
    more complete, clear, and harmonized.
  191: "Examples of how insurers can contribute to climate change adaptation, through\
    \ insurers\u2019 underwriting and pricing practice."
  193: Catastrophe models need to implement different vulnerability curves (damage
    as a function of flood depth) with and without flood-resilience technologies to
    calculate the difference in estimated losses, which are then reflected in risk-based
    premiums.

    and decision under uncertainty.
  212: Model simulations of adaptation measures performance under future conditions
    are used as a basis for providing strategic directions, and often also cost and
    benefit estimates of different possible packages of adaptation measures.

  217: Advocates for combining top-down/local-scale modelling of physical-technical
    limits with bottom-up studies to understand local capacities, preferences, and

  230: The method aims to identify preferable solutions considering technical performance,
    stakeholder acceptance, and cost-benefit ratio in a medium-term perspective (10-40
    years) under uncertainty.
  231: The paper proposes a six-step approach, based on EU guidelines, for analyzing
    alternative options (plans, policies, projects) affected by climate risks or related
    to climate change adaptation. The approach integrates modelling, expert knowledge,
    scenario analysis, multi-criteria analysis, and uncertainty analysis.
  233: The paper proposes a decision support system combining various components.
    It uses the CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm to identify critical
    score values that can overturn the final ranking of adaptation options. The methodology
    aims to mitigate the impacts of uncertainty and increase system resilience by
    identifying the most robust adaptation solutions across different scenarios.
  234: Decision-making for climate change adaptation requires laying out all the conditions
    under which plausible solutions may emerge and search for more robust options,
    instead of assessing discrete and deterministic, or probabilistic, values and
    searching for optimal solutions.

  17: Adaptation involves a mix of interventions, including non-technical options
    such as capacity building that are more difficult to model, but which are critical
    for effective adaptation.
  22: Early IAMs adsorbed endogenous growth theories. The success of adaptation depends
    on the vulnerabilities and capabilities of regions and societies.

  27: The paper aims to address knowledge gaps related to implementing measures to
    motivate adaptation across levels. It contrasts local vs. remote impacts. It highlights
    that current economic studies on climate adaptation tend to focus on local impacts
    and neglect potential remote impacts. The paper discusses challenges for incorporating
    adaptation measures and policies into macroeconomic models.
  29: Adaptation involves cross-regional and cross-sectoral mobility of labor and
    capital, and substitutability between production inputs and consumption commodities.
  30: Impacts vary a lot across regions and in the different RCPs. In some regions,
    the value of forests decreases under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5.

    into discrete narratives for policy formulation.
  48: The paper advocates for global sensitivity analysis as a supplement to historical
    data comparison for climate change impact model validation.

    conclusions and may lead to an overestimation of the effects of other drivers,
    at least for short and mid-term planning periods.
  56: Insights from field-based adaptation stress-testing are limited by the conditions
    experienced during the observation period.

  66: The paper addresses handling uncertainties in agricultural projections under
    climate change.
  76: The paper emphasizes the need to incorporate climate change effects into DRR
    modelling and testing, which is not always done. The flowchart illustrates the

    from scientists to end-users, and understanding the vulnerability relationships
    between environmental indicators and exposed elements.

    of input data, like high-resolution mortality data for the heat-health service.
  124: The paper focuses on the agricultural sector in developing countries and uses
    a theoretical example for drought-prone areas.
  126: The analysis suggests that the quality of weather index forecasts would affect
    the optimal strategy to be selected by an insurance policy buyer under conditions
    of inevitable uncertainty.
  127: The model is a generic modelling scheme that needs to be crop- and region-specific
    to be successfully implemented. Future research should incorporate real-world
    field data for crop yield parameterizations, derive weather indices from weather
    observations/forecasts, and consider probabilistic forecasts for insurers and
    the insured.
  128: "The study suggests incorporating climate change trends into the WII model\
    \ to better assess the impact of future droughts on economic activities, particularly\
    \ agriculture. The model simulates the economic impact of farmers\u2019 decisions\
    \ regarding insurance policy purchases."
  140: The food system actors may respond autonomously based on economic drivers and
    other factors to adapt to climate change. Policy measures are usually needed for
    mitigation actions to be implemented.
  145: Agricultural adaptation measures are not necessarily positively synergistic
    with the environment; Autonomous adaptation in land manager choices is likely
    to be substantially driven by economic interests, meaning that land manager decisions
    are likely to minimize impact to market-based outputs; There has been a lack of
    focus on the, potentially confounding, interactions between climate change mitigation
    and adaptation in the land system

    of modeling limitations by adding and better representing models and scenarios
    across systems.
  180: The paper focuses on water resource management and the challenge of overcoming
    techno-institutional lock-in. It suggests that significant improvements in economic

    their GHG emissions.
  191: No relevant information
  193: The paper highlights the role of insurance in incentivizing climate change
    adaptation by offering lower premiums for properties with implemented flood-resilience
    measures.
  194: Standard basic BI insurance is often considered an 'annexe' to property insurance,
    with no individual assessment of the BI risk, which may be insufficient in cases
    of widespread damage from natural catastrophes; catastrophe models are better
    developed for property damage assessment than for BI, partly due to crude functional
    relationships translating property damage into BI.
  196: The specific natural catastrophe is not explicitly mentioned, but the timing
    aligns with a likely event occurring around August/September 2017. The paper focuses
    on mortgage delinquency as a specific financial risk indicator.
  197: The paper emphasizes the importance of risk-based premiums as an indicator
    of evolving risk and the need for data sharing among stakeholders to ensure risks
    remain insurable.
  209: Climate change impact, vulnerability and adaptation assessments can exceed
    the funding and technical capacity of smaller administrations, and the time needed
    to release such analyses is often too long compared to decision-making timelines.
  212: Current climate risk products may fall short of their promise to inform adaptation
    decision-making on the ground; technical and physical possibilities on the ground,
    as well as local capacities, governance and preference, determine the hard and
    soft limits of adaptation.
  217: Suggests comparing future risks against a baseline of past trends in exposure
    and vulnerability; highlights the importance of understanding vulnerability reductions
    from adaptation measures.
  220: The framework has been applied in almost twenty national climate risk assessments
    worldwide (e.g., Burundi, Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam, Madagascar).
  223: The paper uses a fictional river catchment in a mountainous environment in
    South-East Asia as an example.
  228: The paper emphasizes the prevalence of economic signals in the shorter term
    and climatic signals in the longer term when considering investment decisions
    and adaptation policies.
  230: Effective adaptation policies require substantial investment of financial resources
    and may introduce distributive effects.
  231: The approach emphasizes stakeholder involvement and the development of a shared
    conceptual model of the socio-ecosystem. The analysis is applicable in decision
    contexts with medium-term perspectives typical of investment decisions and adaptation
    policies, acknowledging the prevalence of economic signals in the shorter term
    and climatic signals in the longer term.
