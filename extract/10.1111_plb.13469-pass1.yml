Drivers of Risk:
  4: Decreasing trends in soil moisture anomaly, millennial drought events (2003,
    2018)
  6: Severe droughts, specifically previous-year SMA (soil moisture anomaly).
  10: Drought and soil moisture decrease are indicated as drivers impacting forest
    mortality rates.
Highlights:
  6: European forest ecosystems are negatively affected by severe droughts. Conifer
    mortality is influenced by previous-year SMA. Mortality rates vary spatially and
    temporally.
  10: European forests are experiencing increased mortality trends due to decreasing
    soil moisture, suggesting a tipping point and potential interaction with other
    disturbances like wildfires.
Methodology:
  1: The study uses the ICP Forest crown defoliation dataset to monitor tree mortality.
    It employs a high-resolution drought index based on a hydrological water-balance
    and runoff model to assess soil moisture anomaly. A generalized linear mixed model
    is used to identify the most important drivers of mortality patterns. The analysis
    covers 25 years.
  4: Used the R package brms (version 2.16.3) based on the probabilistic programming
    language Stan to estimate a model incorporating current-year SMA, previous-year
    SMA, and their interaction. Models were run with four MCMC chains, 6000 iterations
    each, with a warm-up of 1000 iterations. Approximate leave-one-out cross validation
    was employed.
  6: 'Long-term forest monitoring, spatial analysis of mortality rates, statistical
    modeling (varying intercept and varying slopes models) to assess the impact of
    previous-year SMA on forest mortality. The maps cover specific time periods: 2003-2005
    and 2018-2020.'
  10: The study uses long-term forest monitoring across European plots to assess mortality
    trends linked to drought; analyses performed with spatially and temporally high-resolution
    dataset.
More Notes:
  1: The study suggests that forest monitoring could play a key role in guiding future
    forest management plans, implying a potential benefit of adaptation through informed
    management.
  4: The analysis examines the relationship between soil moisture anomaly and tree
    mortality.
  6: The data used to generate the maps were scaled for illustration and thresholds
    were chosen to enhance visibility. The study focuses on Norway spruce (Picea abies).
    The effect of previous-year SMA was stronger for conifers compared to broadleaves/minor
    species in a varying intercept model (0.67 versus 0.53).
  10: The page focuses on ecological outcomes rather than direct economic analysis,
    emphasizing the impact of environmental changes on forest health.
