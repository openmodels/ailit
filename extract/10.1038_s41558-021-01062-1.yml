Highlights:
  2: Conservation of tree diversity and primary productivity (via greenhouse gas mitigation)
    can contribute to climate change mitigation, yielding the greatest economic benefit
    for countries incurring the largest climate change damages. There is an opportunity
    for a triple win for climate, biodiversity and society.
  4: Climate change mitigation can substantially reduce the loss of tree diversity
    and productivity compared to unabated warming, particularly in colder and drier
    biomes. The effect varies spatially among regions.
  5: Countries with a high CSCC tend to be the countries where climate change mitigation
    could greatly help maintain primary productivity by safeguarding tree diversity;
    The US and China are estimated to experience some of the biggest economic damages
    due to anthropogenic global warming; Brazil has the largest potential to benefit
    in multiple ways from climate mitigation efforts.
  14: Climate change mitigation can reduce productivity loss by 8.8-38.9% compared
    to a baseline scenario, with effectiveness varying across different SSPs and biomes.
  15: The radar charts visualize the varying contributions of different biomes to
    overall productivity loss across multiple socio-economic scenarios; Mitigation

    avoid biodiversity-dependent productivity loss at the local-scale as log ratios.
  5: The study aggregated regional heterogeneity into country-level estimates and
    related tree diversity effects on productivity to the economic value of avoiding
    carbon emissions. It compared estimates of productivity loss reduction with the
    country-level social cost of carbon (CSCC).
  14: "The effect sizes of \u0394P were calculated at the local scale (30 arcseconds)\
    \ in 14 biomes that include trees. Ensembled results for the effect size across\
    \ three GCMs are shown. The effect size is displayed as a transformed value [-1\
    \ * log(\u0394P mitigation/\u0394P baseline)]."

More Notes:
  2: The study highlights the need to include biodiversity considerations in natural
    climate solutions and reforestation programs.
  4: The effectiveness of mitigation efforts is spatially heterogeneous, with variation
    in how much biodiversity is conserved. High demand for bioenergy can offset the
    benefits of mitigation due to detrimental effects of land-use change on biodiversity.
  5: The study emphasizes that biodiversity conservation can be a significant part
    of the solution to the ongoing climate crisis.
  14: The analysis considers different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to account
    for uncertainties in future socioeconomic development.  The maps and extended
    data figures (not included here) provide further geographical details.
  15: The analysis uses three General Circulation Models (GCMs), with mean values
    presented for the five SSPs.
  16: The analysis focuses on the impact of climate change mitigation on tree diversity-dependent
    productivity rather than on direct macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. The IPBES
    subregions are used as the spatial unit of analysis.
  17: Strong relationship between social cost of carbon and productivity conservation
    across different countries.
  22: The study uses a range of scales from local to global, focusing on countries
    and biomes. It summarizes results at the scale of the subregion used in the Intergovernmental
    Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).
  30: The study uses a log ratio scale to represent the effect size of mitigation
    policies. The data is broken down by biome type, and the results are visualized
    using dot plots, which shows variation across different climate models and socioeconomic
    pathways. The paper focuses on productivity within different biomes rather than
    macroeconomic variables.
  32: The analysis compares different biomes and the impact of climate mitigation
    policies on productivity loss. The analysis seems to focus on the impact of climate
    change and climate mitigation policies on ecosystem productivity.
  33: The analysis considers five SSPs (Sustainability, Middle-of-the-road, Regional
    rivalry, Inequality, Fossil-fueled development) and three GCMs (GFDL-CM3, HadGEM2-ES,
    and MIROC-ESM-CHEM).
  34: The social cost of carbon is country-specific. The mitigation policies address
    the loss of tree diversity-dependent productivity.
  35: The analysis considers the impact of various climate scenarios and socioeconomic
    pathways on carbon productivity and economic factors at a national level, using
    three different climate models to generate a distribution of possible outcomes.
  45: "The paper focuses on tree diversity and productivity changes, even in non-forested\
    \ biomes, where tree species were observed and \u03B8 values were available."
  46: "The paper considers the Burke\u2013Hsiang\u2013Miguel damage function for estimating\
    \ the social cost of carbon.  It focuses on absolute changes in productivity within\
    \ each country rather than proportional changes per area. The study uses area\
    \ of fine grids analysed for biodiversity/productivity changes by considering\
    \ changes in grid area along a latitudinal gradient."
  51: "The study uses a scenario matrix architecture with SSPs and Representative\
    \ Concentration Pathways (RCPs), specifically RCP 2.6 W m\u22122 for mitigation\
    \ scenarios under SSP1, 2, 4, and 5."
  52: The analysis focuses on modeling species distribution and habitat suitability
    using climatic and land-use variables, not macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes.
    The SSP scenarios described are used to determine the climatic data, specifically
    the radiative forcing level, and the time periods examined are the 2050s and 2070s.
  56: The SSP5 scenario assumes high challenges to mitigation and low challenges to
    adaptation, suggesting a focus on adapting to climate change rather than preventing
    it. Local environmental problems like air pollution are successfully managed.
  58: This page describes a workflow to estimate changes in species richness and productivity
    by the 2070s. This seems to be related to ecological impact and does not mention
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes directly.
