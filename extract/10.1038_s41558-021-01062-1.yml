    of 1960-1990), and land-use data (2005) to predict the distribution probability.
    The model was built with linear and quadratic features only and averaged over

  49: "Species distributions are modeled using MaxEnt v3.3, incorporating a bias background\
    \ approach to address sampling bias; models are built using occurrence data from\
    \ GBIF (accessed July 22nd 2015), filtered to exclude records outside native ranges\
    \ as defined by the IUCN Red List and presence/absence in 12 land regions. Native\

  52: Species Distribution Models (SDM) were created using five land-use and 19 bioclimatic
    variables. Multicollinearity was addressed by excluding correlated and collinear
    variables. Parameter tuning was conducted for regularization parameters, and linear
    and quadratic features were used. Predictions were bounded by clamping in MaxEnt.
    Cross-validation was used to yield robust predictions, and the mean probability
    of occurrence was calculated from 10 replicates. The 90% sensitivity threshold
    was used to minimize false-negative fractions.

    \ and coarse (arcminutes for \u03B3-diversity) grids, downscaled from coarse to\
    \ finer scales. Various climate and socioeconomic scenarios, including representative\

More Notes:
  2: The paper emphasizes the importance of including biodiversity considerations
    in natural climate solutions and reforestation programs.
  4: The alleviated loss of tree diversity and the resultant conservation of biodiversity-dependent
    productivity are especially substantial in colder and drier biomes compared to
    warmer and wetter biomes. Land-use changes for mitigation, especially for bioenergy,
    could have detrimental effects on biodiversity in some regions.
  7: The study acknowledges limitations, including not separating individual influences
    of climate mitigation practices, not fully accounting for management and opportunity
    costs, and not considering carbon storage in deadwood and soil. It cautions against
    linearly translating short-term carbon uptake into long-term climate warming halting
    ability.
  12: The paper emphasizes the underutilized positive feedback loop where biodiversity-dependent
    productivity contributes to climate change mitigation, contrasting it with the
    more commonly recognized negative feedback loop of climate change driving biodiversity
    loss.
  13: Analysis is at a coarse spatial scale (30 arcminutes).
  16: The effectiveness of carbon pricing on tree productivity varies considerably
    by region and SSP. The negative effect size suggests that carbon pricing alleviates
    the loss of tree diversity-dependent productivity.
  22: "Analysis is conducted for grids where tree species were observed in the present\
    \ period and \u03B8 values were available, including non-forested biomes. They\
    \ analyze ~115 million fine grids. Terrestrial biome categories are based on the\
    \ 14 terrestrial ecoregions used by the World Wildlife Fund."

    intervals of the effect sizes.

    shown.
  32: Analysis focuses on biome-level changes.

  40: Land-use types are assigned based on the largest area within a fine grid. SSPs
    considered are SSP1, SSP2, SSP3, SSP4, and SSP5, each with different challenges
    to adaptation and mitigation.
  46: "Spatial patterns of productivity responses were not driven by \u03B8 values\
    \ (R2 values between 0.0005 and 0.016). Analysis focuses on country-level loss\
    \ of productivity instead of productivity loss per area when relating it to the\
    \ social cost of carbon."
  48: "The analysis assumes species are at equilibrium with their environment and\
    \ that relevant ecological drivers are included. The spatial resolution is coarse-scale\
    \ (30 arcminutes) and fine-scale (30 arcseconds), and the spatial extent is global\
    \ (Longitude 180\xB0W \u2013 180\xB0E, Latitude 60\xB0S \u201384\xB0N)."
  49: The study uses both fine-scale (30 arcseconds) and coarse-scale (30 arcminutes)
    grids; species with at least 30 refined occurrence records are included. The number
    of background data was determined as 20% of the grids which contain the occurrence
    record of the target taxonomic group.
  50: No relevant information
  51: "Land-use changes were estimated by the AIM/CGE model based on five SSPs (SSP1,\
    \ SSP2, SSP3, SSP4, SSP5). Radiative forcing level of 2.6 W m\u22122 was used\
    \ for the mitigation scenario under SSP1, 2, 4, and 5."
  52: The analysis uses climate data averaged from 2041-2060 for the 2050s and 2061-2080
    for the 2070s.
  53: Conservative assumptions were made to minimize commission errors. Uncertainty
    exists in species-specific dispersal distance estimation and in scenarios.
  55: The SSPs are defined in terms of challenges to mitigation and adaptation.
  57: "The study links species-area and endemics-area relationships to biodiversity\
    \ projections. Future projections were limited to species common enough for widespread\
    \ projection. The distinction between \u03B1-diversity at fine grids and \u03B3\
    -diversity at coarse grids is important for spatial resolution of projections."

    high level.
  59: The hypothetical landscape example is solely for visualizing species co-extinction
    calculations.
  60: The bar graph compares 'Present,' 'Baseline scenario,' and 'Mitigation scenario'
    in terms of some 'Number of' measure, indicating that the scenarios' consequences
    for the 'Number of' measure vary.
  61: The maps depict the geographical distribution of projected changes in tree diversity,
    showing areas with higher or lower percentages of remaining species. Different
    SSPs lead to different geographical patterns.
