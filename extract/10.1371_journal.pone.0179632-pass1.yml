Drivers of Risk:
  1: Future impacts of climate change on marine fisheries.
  2: Climate change impacts on marine ecosystems, influencing life cycles, abundances,
    and distributions of marine species; Changes in fish distribution due to climate
    regime shifts; Deficits in adaptive capacity.
  4: Projected sea surface temperature increase (Exposure); number of fishers, fisheries
    export value as proportion of total export value, proportion of economically active
    population in fishery sector, total fisheries landings, fish protein as proportion
    of all animal protein (Sensitivity); fisheries subsidies, ratio of industrial
    to small-scale fisheries, healthy life expectancy, governance capacity, education
    levels, per capita GDP (Adaptive Capacity).
  6: Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies due to climate change impact marine fisheries.
  7: Climate change impacts on fisheries.
  8: Climate change impacts on marine fisheries.
  9: Climate change impacts on marine fisheries, particularly on Least Developed Countries
    (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS).  Reduction in the number of
    fishers, total fisheries landings or fish protein as proportion of all animal
    protein
  10: Climate change impacts on marine fisheries (specifically, SST anomalies affecting
    fisheries productivity).
  11: Impacts of climate change on fisheries (specifically, changes in sea surface
    temperature (SST) and ocean acidity).
  12: Impacts of climate change on marine fisheries; Regional and global inequalities;
    unsustainable consumption and production patterns.
Highlights:
  1: Least developed countries are most vulnerable, with over 87% found within the
    top half of the vulnerability index.
  2: Coastal LDCs and SIDS are particularly vulnerable, with deficits in adaptive
    capacity as the primary driver.
  4: Climate change vulnerability in marine fisheries is assessed for Least Developed
    Countries (LDCs). The index considers exposure to climate change (sea surface
    temperature), sensitivity of the fishery sector, and the adaptive capacity of
    the country.
  7: Small island states in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean, and countries along the
    Western and Eastern coasts of Africa are the most vulnerable to the effects of
    climate change on fisheries. LDCs are disproportionately vulnerable. OECD states
    are less vulnerable.
  8: Kiribati is identified as the country with the highest vulnerability to climate
    change impacts on marine fisheries, according to this index.
  9: Least Developed Countries are most vulnerable. OECD member states are consistently
    among the least vulnerable countries. There's no apparent linkage between exposure
    to climate change impacts on fisheries and national development levels. Adaptive
    capacity can be enhanced at national and sub-national levels.
  10: Identifies the five most and five least vulnerable countries to climate change
    impacts on marine fisheries under different RCPs and timeframes. Highlights regional
    heterogeneity in vulnerability.
  11: Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts
    on fisheries but have the lowest per capita carbon emissions, highlighting a disparity
    in contribution and impact.
  12: Systematically reducing vulnerability to climate change impacts on marine fisheries
    is closely linked to development objectives. Earmarking climate finance to enhance
    adaptive capacity in vulnerable countries can bring a wide range of benefits.
Methodology:
  1: A vulnerability index is constructed using 12 primary variables to aggregate
    indices for exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity, building on the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change framework.
  2: Refining a global index of vulnerability of national economies to climate change
    impacts on fisheries; Disaggregating marine and inland fisheries in the analysis;
    Using new and updated data sources relevant to marine capture fisheries; Recalculating
    the vulnerability index based on exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.
  4: An index of vulnerability is calculated based on the IPCC framework, building
    upon the methodology of Allison et al. [14]. Variables are normalized to a scale
    of 0 to 1, and indices for exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity are calculated
    and combined.
  6: Calculates a vulnerability index for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) related
    to climate change impacts on marine fisheries. This index is composed of sensitivity
    and adaptive capacity indices. Sensitivity is based on factors like number of
    fishers, fisheries exports, and fish protein consumption. Adaptive capacity is
    based on factors like fisheries subsidies, ratio of industrial to small-scale
    fisheries, healthy life expectancy, governance capacity, education levels, and
    GDP.
  7: "A vulnerability index was calculated in line with the IPCC framework (exposure\
    \ + sensitivity \u2013 adaptive capacity = vulnerability), normalized on a scale\
    \ from 0 to 1. This paper focuses on the vulnerability index for RCP 8.5 over\
    \ the timeframe 2016\u20132050. The adaptive capacity index is the mean of four\
    \ normalized socio-economic variables (half the index) and the mean of two normalized\
    \ fisheries-related variables (the other half). Landlocked countries and 19 other\
    \ countries were excluded due to data limitations, resulting in an index of 147\
    \ countries."
  8: The paper calculates a national vulnerability index to climate change impacts
    on marine fisheries, and it is applicable as of June 20, 2017.
  9: The study uses a vulnerability index based on exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive
    capacity to assess the impact of climate change on marine fisheries, covering
    EEZs of 147 countries.
  10: Ranking of countries by vulnerability to climate change impacts on marine fisheries
    using representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and timeframes (near-future
    and distant-future).
  11: Constructs a vulnerability index and correlates it with per capita carbon emissions
    using statistical methods (Spearman's correlation).
  12: Uses a vulnerability index related to climate change impacts on marine fisheries
    for least developed countries. Utilizes multi-model ensemble means derived from
    CMIP5 climate models (CanESM2, CNRM-CM5, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2G, GFDL-ESM2M, GISS-E2-H,
    GIS-S-E2-R, HadGEM2-AO, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MIROC5, MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR, NorESM1-M,
    NorESM1-ME).
More Notes:
  1: The index provides a useful tool for prioritizing the allocation of climate finance,
    as well as activities aimed at capacity building and the transfer of marine technology.
  4: The page provides the equations to compute the overall Vulnerability index based
    on Exposure, Sensitivity and Adaptive Capacity components. It defines the components
    in terms of E1 (sea surface temperature anomalies), S1-S5 (various fishery statistics),
    AC1-AC6 (various fishery statistics and socioeconomic indicators).
  6: The paper uses CMIP5 files for SST anomaly calculations, adapted from Kristiansen
    [32][33]. Normalization is used to scale variables from 0 to 1.
  8: The study categorizes countries into quartiles based on their vulnerability scores.
    It only assesses vulnerability of national economies to climate change via marine
    fisheries.
  9: The paper discusses that mitigation efforts at the global level could affect
    the relative vulnerability of individual countries. A reduction in sensitivity,
    while improving the vulnerability score, is less clear-cut due to potential negative
    consequences such as job losses or reduced food security. A continuous drop in
    employment in the fisheries sector contributes to lower vulnerability scores for
    OECD countries.
  10: The paper mentions that providing fishing subsidies or encouraging industrial
    fishing could result in long-term decreases in national vulnerability scores,
    but immediately destabilize local fishing communities. The paper acknowledges
    that the sensitivity component of the analysis reveals hotspots of SST anomalies
    but does not quantify the impacts. A suggestion is made to specify projected changes
    in fisheries productivity.
  11: Homogenization of SST anomalies and socio-economic variables across Exclusive
    Economic Zones (EEZs) may mask local variabilities and require further refinements
    in the calculation of the exposure index, potentially at a local or regional level.

  4: Vulnerability (V) = Exposure (E) + Sensitivity (S) + Adaptive Capacity (AC) where
    V,E,S,AC are indices.  E = E1N; S = Average(S1N + S2N + S3N + S4N + S5N); AC =
    0.5 * [Average(AC1N + AC2N) + Average(AC3N + AC4N + AC5N + AC6N)] - all subscript
    N variables are normalized on a 0-1 scale.
  7: "87% of the world\u2019s least developed countries (LDCs) with coastlines are\
    \ in the top half of the vulnerability index. 25 OECD member states are in the\
    \ bottom half of the index. 86% of OECD states are in the top quartile for adaptive\
    \ capacity. All 29 countries in Europe appeared in the lower two quartiles of\
    \ the vulnerability index. 17 countries in Africa, 4 in North America/Caribbean,\
