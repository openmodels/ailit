Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global warming leading to changes in drought severity and duration, assessed
    using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI).
  2: Rising temperatures leading to more intense and frequent dry spells.
  3: "Changes in global drought conditions under 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warming, identified\
    \ using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) combined\
    \ with the run theory and with climate scenarios simulated by 13 CMIP5 global\
    \ climate models (GCMs) under three RCPs (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5)."
  4: Global mean temperature increases under different RCPs, specifically RCP2.6,
    RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. The paper also uses surface downwelling and upwelling shortwave
    and longwave flux to calculate net radiation, and soil heat flux.
  5: "Changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (P-PET), calculated\
    \ using projected temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and atmospheric\
    \ pressure from GCMs under 1.5\xB0C and 2\xB0C warming scenarios."
  6: "Additional 1.5 and 2.0\xB0C warming conditions leading to changes in drought\
    \ duration and severity (as measured by SPEI-3)"
  7: "Increasing global temperatures (specifically 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming targets)\
    \ and different RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 8.5) impacting SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration\
    \ Index) mean and standard deviation."
  8: "Changes in drought duration and severity, and extra 0.5\u25E6C warming."
  9: Increasing drought risks, defined as more frequent historical 50-year events,
    drive the socioeconomic impacts.
  10: "The drivers of risk are climate warming (specifically comparing 1.5\xB0C and\
    \ 2.0\xB0C warming targets) and different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)."
  11: "The primary driver of risk is climate warming, specifically 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0\
    C warming scenarios."
  12: Warming-induced hydrological changes including simultaneous increase in precipitation
    and evaporative demand.
  13: "Changes in joint 50-year return periods of droughts between the 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6\
    C warming targets; potential evapotranspiration; increasing stomatal resistance\
    \ (rs)"
  14: "More frequent severe droughts under the 1.5\u25E6C and 2.0\u25E6C warming targets"
  15: "Changes in drought characteristics, specifically the 50-year joint return period\
    \ based on SPEI thresholds of -0.5 and -0.8. The influence of different warming\
    \ scenarios (1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C targets). Also consider 20- and 100-year drought\
    \ events. Potential drivers include El Ni\xF1o frequency, extension of the Hadley\
    \ cell, and poleward moisture transport."
  16: Drought risks and population (GDP) both contribute to the exposure change.
  17: Droughts, specifically changes in SPEI-3 (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration
    Index).
  18: Changes in drought duration and severity, measured by the SPEI combined with
    the run theory, with the incorporation of the copula functions.

    C warming scenarios."
  18: "Changes in global drought bivariate magnitudes and socioeconomic consequences\
    \ in the 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warmer worlds are quantified, focusing on drought\
    \ duration and severity."
Highlights:
  1: "Limiting global warming to 1.5\u25E6C, compared with 2\u25E6C warming, can perceptibly\
    \ mitigate the drought impacts over major regions of the world."
  2: "Drought conditions would considerably worsen in many regions of the world due\
    \ to rising temperatures. There are considerable benefits for the environment\
    \ and society in limiting warming to 1.5\xB0C relative to 2.0\xB0C, although 1.5\xB0\
    C warming still implies a substantial challenge for global sustainable development.\
    \ The authors state that there is an urgent necessity to incorporate the joint\
    \ modeling of multiple drought features into impact assessments."
  4: "The paper projects future global mean temperatures under different RCP scenarios\
    \ to assess the timing of reaching 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming thresholds. This\
    \ is used to study droughts."
  6: Dryness will intensify in a future warming world, with decreasing SPEI-3 values
    across most of the globe. Drought duration and severity are projected to increase,
    particularly in Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean, southern Africa, southern North
    America, and South America. Increased drought severity is projected in tropics
    and high-latitude areas, while the duration will decrease.
  7: "The world will experience more severe drought conditions with a further increase\
    \ in drought severity accounting for 75% of the land surface (differences in effects\
    \ between the 1.5 and 2.0\xB0C warming levels) and a persistent lengthening in\
    \ duration across 58% of the land areas. Drought frequency, duration, and severity\
    \ are projected to pronouncedly lengthen under three RCPs."
  8: Droughts are projected to become more frequent and severe across large portions
    of the globe with increasing warming levels, especially in South America, northeastern
    America, central and western Asia, and Northwest China.
  9: Large percentages of population and GDP will be exposed to increasing drought
    risks globally. The most drought-affected countries are presented by high fractions
    of affected population and GDP relative to their national totals.
  10: "Limiting warming to 1.5\xB0C instead of 2\xB0C offers benefits in terms of\
    \ reduced drought exposure. There is spatial heterogeneity in drought exposure\
    \ changes, with some regions (e.g., Canada) potentially experiencing decreased\
    \ drought exposure at 2\xB0C warming compared to 1.5\xB0C under specific scenarios."
  11: ''
  12: "Ambitiously limiting warming to 1.5\u25E6C would substantially mitigate future\
    \ drought risks and corresponding socioeconomic exposures."
  13: Neglecting increasing rs may overestimate future drying conditions and corresponding
    drought risk changes; the increase in total leaf area with CO2 and growing-season
    length can cause countervailing decreases in rs.
  14: Maps illustrate how population and GDP are projected to vary across the globe
    under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) in response to different
    climate pathways and highlight regional disparities under each scenario.
  15: Aggravated drought risks are projected globally, with larger increases in mid-latitudes
    and tropical regions. Regions like the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and southern
    North America are particularly vulnerable. High model agreement in several drought-prone
    areas implies higher confidence in projections. Significant model uncertainty
    is present in regions with small changing amplitudes (e.g., Southeast Asia and
    Russia). The tropical and mid-latitude regions, where most of the global population
    resides, would bear the greatest drought risks.
  16: "Around 88% of global landmasses are projected to be exposed to increasing drought\
    \ risks under the 1.5\u25E6C warming climate."
  17: "Increasing drought risks at the global scale under climate warming, particularly\
    \ for mid-latitude areas and the tropics. Controlling global warming at the 1.5\xB0\
    C level is important."
  18: "The means of SPEI-3 are projected to descend at a global scale from the historical\
    \ period to the 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warmer worlds, while the standard deviation\
    \ exhibits large increases."
Methodology:
  1: Copula functions and the most likely realization are incorporated to model the
    joint distribution of drought severity and duration, and changes in the bivariate
    return period with global warming are evaluated.
  2: The study discusses different approaches to examining the sensitivity of drought
    risks with different warming targets, including using ensemble simulations from
    a single climate model (CESM), the HAPPI model, and CMIP5 climate models. It also
    highlights the importance of incorporating the joint modeling of multiple drought
    features (severity and duration) using copula functions.
  3: Drought characteristics are identified using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration
    Index (SPEI) combined with the run theory and with climate scenarios simulated
    by 13 CMIP5 global climate models (GCMs) under three RCPs (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and
    RCP8.5). The copula functions and most likely realization are incorporated to
    model the drought severity and duration concurrently, and changes in the bivariate
    return period with global warming are systematically investigated.
  4: "Uses 13 Global Climate Models (GCMs). PET (Potential Evapotranspiration) is\
    \ calculated using the Penman\u2013Monteith approach. The equations for calculating\
    \ PET, including components like net radiation (Rn), soil heat flux (G), and a\
    \ psychometric constant (\u03B3) are provided."
  5: Calculates the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI-3) using
    a log-logistic distribution fitted to 3-month P-PET deficits. Drought events are
    identified using run theory with a threshold of SPEI-3 < -0.5. Joint return periods
    of drought duration and severity are modeled using a Gumbel copula. The "most
    likely realization" method is used to choose drought scenarios along a given return
    period isoline.
  6: "Calculates joint recurrence frequency of drought events under 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0\
    C warming scenarios based on historical 50-year bivariate quantiles. Assesses\
    \ changes in mean and standard deviation of SPEI-3. Estimates socioeconomic exposures\
    \ by recording population and GDP in areas with increased drought risk, using\
    \ different SSPs and multi-year average populations/GDPs during 30-year periods\
    \ determined by different warming levels. Uses multi-model ensemble mean to reduce\
    \ model bias, based on three RCPs and corresponding SSPs."
  7: Analysis uses multi-model ensemble mean results, with violin plots displaying
    the probability distribution of drought characteristics across all land pixels.
    The SPEI-3 is used for drought frequency.
  8: Changes in SPEI mean and standard deviation are projected under RCP2.6, RCP4.5,
    and RCP8.5 scenarios.
  9: "Drought projections are combined with population and GDP information based on\
    \ SSPs to estimate exposures in 1.5\u25E6C and 2.0\u25E6C warmer worlds. The fraction\
    \ of drought-affected population (or GDP) divided by total national population\
    \ (or total GDP) is used as the indicator."
  10: "The analysis compares socioeconomic exposures under three SSPs and differences\
    \ in percentage between the 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warming levels. The timeframe isn't\
    \ specified on this page, but implied by the comparison of different warming scenarios."

  12: "The reference crop Penman\u2013Monteith model is employed to calculate potential\
    \ evapotranspiration (and thus SPEI)."
  13: Run theory used to identify drought events based on a threshold; bivariate frequency
    analysis; fixed stomatal resistance (rs) method used to calculate potential evapotranspiration;
    Threshold of -0.5 employed to identify droughts; comparison using -0.8 threshold.
  14: "Analysis performed by projecting population and GDP exposure under different\
    \ Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs: SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585) for 1.5\xB0\
    C and 2.0\xB0C warming scenarios."
  15: "Drought risks are analyzed based on SPEI drought categories (Table 2). Socioeconomic\
    \ exposures are based on variations of drought risks using dynamic population\
    \ and GDP pathways. Figures 11 and 12 illustrate projected changes in drought\
    \ risks for eight typical drought-prone countries under 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C\
    \ warming targets, respectively. Figures 14 and 15 show drought risk changes based\
    \ on the -0.8 threshold."
  16: "Exposure is de\uFB01ned as the number of people (GDP) being exposed to areas\
    \ where the bivariate drought risks increase underthe warming climate. Population\
    \ (and GDP) differences between the \uFB01xed 30-year 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warming\
    \ periods are considered."
  17: "Uses global climate models (GCMs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)\
    \ to project changes in SPEI-3. Quantifies uncertainty using the 90% range of\
    \ changing SPEI-3 characteristics from historical to 1.5\xB0C warming and from\
    \ 1.5\xB0C to 2.0\xB0C warming. Analyzes bivariate return periods of present 50-year\
    \ drought conditions under RCP4.5."
  18: The study uses climate projections from multi-model ensembles under RCP2.6,
    RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. Drought characteristics are identified using the SPEI combined
    with the run theory.
More Notes:
  3: Uses SPEI-3, which captures well the shallow soil moisture available to crops
    and reflects seasonal water loss processes.
  4: The paper provides a table listing the 13 GCMs used, including their resolution
    and the institution responsible for each model.
  5: Focuses on bivariate analysis of drought duration and severity, acknowledging
    the limitations of univariate approaches and the importance of considering both
    aspects for assessing drought impacts.
  6: "The increasing standard deviation of SPEI-3 in some regions (e.g., northern\
    \ Africa and southwestern Asia) in a 1.5\xB0C warmer world suggests more variability\
    \ in dryness, hindering resilience efforts."
  7: Drought-prone conditions are more severe in regions such as Mediterranean regions,
    South Africa and South America.
  8: The analysis focuses on changes to historical 50-year drought events.
  9: Economically prosperous regions are associated with higher population and immigration,
    thus, drought-affected GDP exposures usually exhibit similar changing patterns
    with the population.
  10: The US and China are no longer the most drought-affected countries in the projections
    mentioned on this page.
  11: The study highlights a difference in the severity of drought impacts between
    tropical and extratropical regions, with tropical regions expected to experience
    more profound increases in drought risks.
  12: The study found decreasing SPEI-3 and significantly increasing drought severity
    and duration with warming globally.
  13: Impact of rs on drought assessments deserves further studies but is beyond the
    scope of this study; Inclusion of minor drought events can enlarge the sample
    size in bivariate frequency analysis.
  14: Figures 9 and 10 (mentioned in the caption) are not included in the provided
    text and images, so their specific content is unknown. The paper uses the Shared
    Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to model future conditions.
  15: "The study analyzes drought risk changes under different climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6,\
    \ SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5) and warming targets (1.5\xB0C, 2.0\xB0C). Figures S7 and\
    \ S8 analyze socioeconomic exposures when -0.8 is used as the SPEI threshold."
  16: The analysis highlights a neglect of dynamic socioeconomic impacts in some earlier
    studies, which may lead to biased conclusions.
  17: Model uncertainty is relatively large, particularly for South America and Africa.
    Dynamic population and GDP should be incorporated into exposure-calculating processes.
    Role of drought risk changes should be given attention.
