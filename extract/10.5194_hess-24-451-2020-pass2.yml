Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Increases in magnitude of global droughts in 1.5 and 2\u25E6C warmer climates"
  3: "Changes in global drought conditions (severity and duration) under 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6\
    C warming scenarios simulated by climate models under different RCPs."
  6: Increased temperatures leading to more frequent and persistent dry spells, and
    higher evaporative demands.
  7: Global temperature rise and increased frequency and severity of droughts under
    warming conditions.
  9: "Increasing drought risks (more frequent historical 50-year events) exacerbated\
    \ by a 1.5\xB0C warming target."
  10: "The primary driver of risk is climate warming, specifically the difference\
    \ between 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming targets. The RCP scenarios are also risk\
    \ drivers."
  11: "Climate warming, specifically 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming targets relative\
    \ to historical levels; RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 climate scenarios; Oceanic\
    \ forcing that favors deep convection over the ocean, weakening continental convergence\
    \ associated with the monsoon."
  12: Increasing drought risks under warming climates, driven by simultaneous increase
    in precipitation and evaporative demand and the intensification of drought conditions
    due to increased water scarcity.
  16: "Increasing drought risks due to warming climates (1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming\
    \ targets)."
  17: "Increasing drought risks due to climate change (specifically, exceeding 1.5\xB0\
    C and 2.0\xB0C warming targets). Dynamic population and GDP growth exacerbating\
    \ exposure."
  18: Differences in hydro-meteorological variables such as precipitation, wind speed,
    and relative humidity, which impact drought evolution.
Highlights:
  1: "Limiting global warming to 1.5\u25E6C, compared with 2\u25E6C warming, can perceptibly\
    \ mitigate the drought impacts over major regions of the world."
  3: "The study quantifies the drought exposures of populations and regional GDP under\
    \ different SSPs globally, considering different warming levels (1.5 and 2.0\u25E6\
    C)."
  6: Several regions experience compound increases in both drought severity and duration,
    such as Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean, southern Africa, southern North America,
    and South America.
  7: Projected increases in drought magnitude and socioeconomic exposure under climate
    warming scenarios, with particularly severe impacts in regions like the Mediterranean,
    South Africa, and South America.
  9: Large percentages of population and GDP will be exposed to increasing drought
    risks globally under three SSPs; many countries may have 100% or 50% exposure
    of both populations and GDPs.
  10: "Holding global warming to 1.5\xB0C instead of 2\xB0C has benefits, particularly\
    \ for mitigating population and GDP exposure to drought. Mexico, southern Europe,\
    \ central and southern Africa, and the Mediterranean regions are projected to\
    \ experience more severe drought."
  11: "Drought risks are projected to increase significantly in hotspot countries,\
    \ particularly in the tropics (Mexico and Brazil) compared to extratropical regions\
    \ (Canada). A 1.5\xB0C warming could expose a large proportion of the population\
    \ and GDP in some tropical countries to significantly more frequent extreme droughts."
  12: "Ambitiously limiting warming to 1.5\xB0C would substantially mitigate future\
    \ drought risks and corresponding socioeconomic exposures."
  16: "A significant portion of global landmass is projected to face increasing drought\
    \ risks under even a 1.5\xB0C warming scenario, leading to increased population\
    \ and GDP exposure."
  17: "Controlling global warming at the 1.5\xB0C level is strengthened as beneficial\
    \ and necessary due to the divergent impacts on population and economy between\
    \ 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming levels. Drought risks will double across 58% and\
    \ 67% of the global landmasses at the 1.5 and 2.0 deg C warming level respectively.\
    \ GDP exposure increases substantially at 2.0 deg C warming levels."
  18: Projected increase in drought severity and duration under warming scenarios
    can influence regional GDP exposure.
Methodology:
  1: The drought characteristics are identified using the Standardized Precipitation
    Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) combined with the run theory, with the climate
    scenarios projected by 13 Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5)
    global climate models (GCMs) under three representative concentration pathways
    (RCP 2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5).
  3: Uses the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) combined
    with run theory and climate scenarios simulated by 13 CMIP5 global climate models
    under three RCPs (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). Copula functions are incorporated
    to model drought severity and duration concurrently. Spatially explicit global
    shared SSPs are used to assess population and GDP exposure.
  6: Socioeconomic exposures are estimated using multi-year average populations and
    GDPs during 30-year periods determined by different warming levels, employing
    different SSPs (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways).
  9: "Combines drought projections with population and GDP information based on SSPs\
    \ to estimate exposures in 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warmer worlds; uses nation-wide\
    \ population and GDP fractions to avoid covering up badly drought-affected countries\
    \ with small national populations or GDP."
  10: "The analysis compares socioeconomic exposures under three SSPs (Shared Socioeconomic\
    \ Pathways) at 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming levels, and also examines changes\
    \ in drought duration and severity under different RCP (Representative Concentration\
    \ Pathway) scenarios. The results are applicable for the projected changes in\
    \ drought characteristics associated with specific warming levels."
  11: 'Spatially aggregates mean changes in drought return periods at a national scale,
    binning land fractions of each grid cell against the change in drought return
    period. Assessment done for eight hotspot countries: Argentina, Australia, Canada,
    China, United States, South Africa, Brazil, and Mexico.'
  12: The study uses decreasing SPEI-3 as well as significantly increasing drought
    severity and duration to measure drought impacts.
  16: "The study considers dynamic characteristics by examining differences in population\
    \ and GDP between fixed 30-year 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming periods to assess\
    \ socioeconomic exposure."
  17: The study projects changes in drought risks using multi-model ensembles and
    three RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
    (SSPs). It analyzes SPEI-3 (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index)
    to quantify drought conditions.
  18: "The analysis uses multiple models from the CMIP5 ensemble and involves re-gridding\
    \ to incorporate socioeconomic data at appropriate spatial resolutions, considering\
    \ warming levels of 1.5\xB0C and 2\xB0C."
More Notes:
  1: "This study quantifies the change in global drought conditions and corresponding\
    \ socioeconomic exposures for additional 1.5 and 2.0\u25E6C warming trajectories\
    \ using a bivariate framework."
  3: The study uses a bivariate framework to assess drought impacts, considering both
    severity and duration. It also employs spatially explicit SSPs for population
    and GDP data.
  6: The analysis uses multi-model ensemble means to reduce model bias and considers
    three RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) and corresponding SSPs under
    two warming targets for six scenarios.
  9: Economically prosperous regions are associated with higher population and immigration,
    leading to similar changing patterns between drought-affected GDP and population
    exposures; low GDP and population density countries, even with small total socioeconomic
    exposures, can experience fatal and destructive losses due to poor drought resilience.
  10: "There is spatial heterogeneity in drought exposure variations, with some countries\
    \ like Canada potentially experiencing a slight decrease in drought exposure at\
    \ 2.0\xB0C compared to 1.5\xB0C."
  11: The analysis uses 20 bins for land fractions in each of the eight example countries.
    The distributions for drought characteristics (frequency, duration, severity)
    under different time periods are shown in Figure 6. Figures 11 and 12 show land
    fractions of each grid cell plotted against the change in drought return period.
    Socioeconomic exposure is shown in Figs. S3 and S4.
  12: "The study uses the reference crop Penman\u2013Monteith model to calculate potential\
    \ evapotranspiration, with surface resistance fixed at 70 s m-1, although it acknowledges\
    \ that elevated CO2 environments can drive stomatal closure."
  16: The study contrasts with earlier studies that used population and GDP data from
    single years, highlighting the importance of considering dynamic socio-economic
    changes when assessing climate risks.
  17: The study acknowledges uncertainty induced by GCMs and RCP scenarios, and highlights
    the importance of considering model uncertainty in climate change impact studies.
    The magnitude of drought risk changes is crucial, not just the percentage of affected
    landmasses.

Quantitative material:
  1: "The historical 50-year droughts may double across 58% of global landmasses in\
    \ a 1.5\u25E6C warmer world, while when the warming climbs up to 2.0\u25E6C, an\
    \ additional 9% of world landmasses would be exposed to such catastrophic drought\
    \ deteriorations."
  3: The study quantifies changes in bivariate return period of drought with global
    warming and assesses drought exposures of populations and regional GDP under different
    SSPs globally.
  6: Drought severity shows a much more pronounced rise globally, with significant
    increases (exceeding 50%) over 46% of global landmasses.
  9: "In more than 67 (140) countries, 100% (50%) of both populations and GDPs are\
    \ exposed to more severe droughts under the 1.5\u25E6C warming target."
  10: "An additional 17 countries are projected to exhibit a 100% fraction in socioeconomic\
    \ exposure under the extra half-degree warming; More than 10 countries would experience\
    \ a 30% increase in population and GDP exposure if the global warming level increased\
    \ from 1.5 to 2.0\u25E6C. The land fraction suffering more frequent severe droughts\
    \ in Canada will decrease (\u221212.77%) in the 2.0\u25E6C warming level compared\
    \ to 1.5\u25E6C warming under the SSP126 scenario."
  11: "In a 1.5\xB0C warming world, more than 85% of grid cells over Mexico and Brazil\
    \ (associated with around 65%-97% of national populations and GDPs) could be exposed\
    \ to the historical 50-year drought every 20 years."
  12: "More than 90% of the grid cells (associated with around 90%\u2013100% of the\
    \ national population and GDP) across Brazil and Mexico will experience drought\
    \ frequency double that of the historical 50-year drought under the 1.5\xB0C warming\
    \ target."
  16: "Under the 1.5\xB0C warming climate, around 88% of global landmasses are exposed\
    \ to increasing drought risks."
  17: "Global population and GDP exposed to drought risks are quantified for 1.5\xB0\
    C and 2.0\xB0C warming levels across different SSPs. E.g., at 1.5\xB0C, the average\
    \ of the three SSPs estimates USD33311.1 billion of GDP is exposed. At 2.0\xB0\
    C this rises to USD72852.2 billion. The paper also quantifies the percentage of\
    \ landmasses where drought risks will double at the 1.5\xB0C and 2.0\xB0C warming\
    \ levels (58% and 67% respectively)."
