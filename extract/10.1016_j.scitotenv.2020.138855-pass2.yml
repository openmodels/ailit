Drivers of Risk:
  2: Increasing hydro-meteorological hazards (HMHs), such as heatwaves and floods.
  7: Extreme hydro-meteorological hazards, specifically floods, droughts, heatwaves,
    and landslides, drive economic damages and loss of life in Europe.
  9: Landslides are triggered by the combination of meteorological, hydrological,
    and geological factors; Rising temperatures and heavy precipitation affect slope
    stability of rocks, which increases the frequency and intensity of shallow landslides
  17: Hydro-Meteorological Risks (HMRs), uncertainty related to the assessment of
    HMRs, degree of social/cultural acceptance
  18: Heavy precipitation causing floods, heatwaves and droughts, storm events, sea
    level rise, climate change leading to increased temperature and altered precipitation
    patterns.
Highlights:
  2: Holistic management of HMHs by effective use of NBS can be achieved with standard
    compliant data for replicating and monitoring NBS in OALs, knowledge about policy
    silos and interaction between research communities and end-users.
  7: Flooding caused the largest economic damages and the majority of European deaths
    were due to extreme heatwave events.
  9: No relevant information
  17: A real market opportunity exists for NBS, and public administration is beginning
    to invest in them instead of classical solutions to tackle different HMRs.
  18: Europe has experienced significant economic losses and loss of life due to climate-related
    hazards, particularly floods and heatwaves.
Methodology:
  2: Discusses the operationalisation and implementation processes of Nature-based
    Solutions (NBS) by means of a novel concept of Open-Air Laboratories (OAL) for
    its wider acceptance.
  9: No relevant information
  17: Conceptual framework based on a set of sustainability KPI (Key Performance Indicators)
    can be developed and used to monitor and measure the long-term performance potentials
    of NBS; Monitoring NBS performance for compliance with the design brief
More Notes:
  2: Nature-based solutions (NBS) are being promoted as adaptive measures against
    predicted increasing hydrometeorological hazards (HMHs).
  7: Policy recommendations include the need for spatial analysis to assist national
    and EU-level policy-making and resource allocation for adaptation measures against
    HMHs.
  9: The page mentions indicators to monitor the intensity and impact of landslides,
    including consecutive wet days, maximum daily precipitation and temperature, persistent
    precipitation, landslide displacement rate, and groundwater level.
  17: Availability and adequacy of data represents a 'hidden' challenge in the process
    of NBS acceptance and assessment; Discussion focuses on co-design and co-development
    processes with challenges such as assessment of HMH (Human-Modified Habitat) and
    related risks.

  18: "Economic losses caused by climate-related hazards in EEA-33-member countries\
    \ amounted to 618.5 billion USD in the period 1980\u20132017; approximately 502.56\
    \ billion USD losses were specifically caused by weather and climate-related extreme\
    \ events."
Outcomes of Interest:
  7: Economic losses due to hydro-meteorological hazards (HMHs) are anticipated to
    rise from 14.4 billion USD per year to 88.8 billion USD per year in Europe by
    the end of the 21st century.
Quantitative Material:
  7: Economic losses from 1900 to 2019 amounted to approximately 502.6 billion USD
    in Europe, with floods accounting for the largest economic damages (76.2%).
Quantitative material:
  2: HMHs were responsible for more than 80% (502.56 billion USD) of the total economic
    damage due to natural hazards (618.5 billion USD) and caused around 90,325 fatalities
    in Europe during the period from 1980 to 2017.
