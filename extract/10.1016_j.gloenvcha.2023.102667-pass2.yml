Drivers of Risk:
  1: Fire carbon emissions are impacted by climate and socioeconomic changes.
  2: Meteorology, biomass, land use, population density, and gross domestic product
    (GDP) per capita.
  3: Compound effects of five factors (meteorology, biomass, land use, population
    density, and gross domestic product [GDP] per capita) on future fire C emissions.
  5: Burned area driven by agricultural fires, peat fires, and deforestation, degradation
    and fragmentation (DDF) fires.
  6: Meteorology (air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, wind speed, soil
    properties), biomass, land use, population, and GDP. Also, RCP (Representative
    Concentration Pathway) and SSP (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway) scenarios, climate
    change (specifically global warming).
  9: Increased global fire carbon emissions, driven by factors such as meteorology,
    biomass availability, land use, population density, and GDP per capita; Population
    increase can reduce fire ignitions in some areas but increase anthropogenic ignition
    in areas with low historical population density; Lower GDP per capita correlates
    with higher fire carbon emissions.
  10: Global warming increases future fire C emissions through meteorological changes
    (fuel dryness) and increased biomass (fuel load and continuity).
  11: Economic development and GDP per capita changes are identified as key drivers
    impacting the occurrence of fires.
  12: Global warming, meteorological conditions, and socioeconomic factors such as
    GDP and land use
Highlights:
  1: Sustainable economic development might decrease future emissions.
  2: An increase in GDP per capita leads to improvement in fire management and capitalized
    agriculture, decreasing fire carbon emissions.
  3: Determine which factors act to decrease or increase future fire C emissions and
    the locations of the affected areas
  5: No relevant information
  6: The study aims to identify key factors characterizing SSPs and RCPs that affect
    future fire C emissions.
  9: Increases in GDP per capita are identified as a powerful factor in reducing fire
    carbon emissions; The impact of GDP per capita on fire carbon emissions is greatest
    in regions with historically low GDP per capita such as the African savanna, Southeast
    Asia, west Asia, and some of South America; Population increase can have contrasting
    effects, reducing fire ignitions in some areas but increasing anthropogenic ignition
    in others.
  10: Increased GDP per capita mainly reduced future fire C emissions.
  11: The main finding is that economic development (increases in GDP per capita)
    could lead to reduced fire occurrences and carbon emissions, which could significantly
    affect carbon budgets and GHG emissions.
  12: Global fire C emissions projected to decrease; economic growth contributes to
    reductions through better fire management and agriculture
Methodology:
  1: The study models the impact of climate and socioeconomic changes on future fire
    carbon emissions.
  2: Explored fire carbon emissions throughout the 21st century by changing five factors
    (meteorology, biomass, land use, population density, and gross domestic product
    [GDP] per capita).
  3: Uses the Community Land Model (CLM)-based fire model to predict changes in future
    fire C emissions in the 21st century by changing these five drivers under nine
    SSP-RCP scenarios.
  5: Parameter optimization using a genetic algorithm (GA) with 200 iterations of
    50 different sets, selecting constant coefficients for agricultural, peat, and
    DDF fires. Model error is calculated in terms of global and regional (14 GFED
    regions) mean annual burned area. Fire emissions are calculated by incorporating
    fuel combustion (FC) dependent on biomass available to burn and combustion completeness
    (CC).
  6: "A decomposition analysis of future cumulative fire C emissions (CCE) for the\
    \ period 2020\u20132099 (80 years) is conducted to identify the key factors characterizing\
    \ the SSPs and RCPs.  The method of Marangoni et al. (2017) and Stehfest et al.\
    \ (2019) is used to identify both the individual and total effects (including\
    \ the interaction effects) of each of these factors on future CCE with a limited\
    \ number of model experiments. Reference scenario set to have the same conditions\
    \ as the historical period."
  9: "Decomposition analysis is used to determine the contribution of various factors\
    \ (meteorology, biomass, land use, population density, and GDP per capita) on\
    \ cumulative fire C emission changes from 2020\u20132099 compared to historical\
    \ conditions; The analysis considers various SSP-RCP scenarios to understand the\
    \ range of possible outcomes."
  10: The original socioeconomic impact functions (CLMfse) were used to project future
    fire C emissions; sensitivity tests were performed.
  11: The analysis uses global vegetation models and socioeconomic factors to project
    future fire emissions under different scenarios, with a focus on the impact of
    GDP per capita on fire occurrences.
  12: Simulation using a CLM-based fire model to analyze impacts of meteorology, biomass,
    and human activity
More Notes:
  1: This paper focuses on fire carbon emissions, but it doesn't directly discuss
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes or the costs/benefits of adaptation at
    a national level. The link to sustainable economic development reducing emissions
    is potentially relevant in the broader context of adaptation benefits.
  2: Fires in boreal forests were particularly expected to increase because of an
    increase in fuel dryness.
  3: The study aims to understand potential future fire C emissions and determine
    appropriate responses, also identifying key drivers for increasing or decreasing
    future fire C emissions.
  5: Restrictions for non-peat fires are stronger due to increasing GDP in tree-dominant
    regions.
  6: The study uses ISIMIP2b simulations for meteorology and biomass variables. Land
    use data for SSP3-26 and SSP1-6.0 were unavailable, so SSP3-3.4 land use data
    for the SSP3-2.6 scenario and SSP1-8.5 land use data for SSP1-6.0 were used as
    a compromise. The study fixes other human influences and land use scenarios affecting
    other input variables to allow for a clear division of the role of the factors
    in future fire changes. Interaction effects between single factors are not explicitly
    proven, but the method reduces the number of model runs needed to identify the
    bulk interaction between other factors.
  9: The study focuses on fire carbon emissions (CCE) as a key variable, which relates
    to climate change and potential impacts on various sectors; The provided figures
    and tables visually represent the complex interactions between climate scenarios,
    socioeconomic pathways, and drivers of fire emissions.
  10: Population density increases can both increase (ignition) and decrease (suppression)
    fire C emissions.
  11: The study highlights the uncertainty and limitations in modeling the socioeconomic
    impacts on fire emissions and emphasizes the need for further research to validate
    these relationships.

    using Eq. (6). Equation (7) describes the calculation of carbon emissions from
    burned area using fuel consumption. Equation (8) describes the calculation of
    fuel consumption from biomass and combustion completeness.
  6: Carbon density per depth in tropical peat set at 0.4 kg C m^-2 cm^-1, burned
    soil depth at 51 cm, assuming 20.4 kg C m^-2 of peat burning occurs in peat fire
    areas. In boreal peat fires, the carbon emission due to peat combustion was set
    at 2.2 kg C m^-2.
  9: The paper provides estimates of the reduction in global fire carbon emissions
    (Pg C yr-1) in the 2090s compared to historical values for various SSP-RCP scenarios
    (Table 4); It estimates that increases in GDP per capita could reduce cumulative
    fire C emissions by 78.8 (SSP3) to 94.6 (SSP1) Pg C from 2020 to 2099.
  10: "The decrease in CCE (cumulative carbon emissions) over the 80-year period was\
    \ 17\u201332 Pg C smaller with the CLMfse (original socioeconomic impact functions)\
    \ functions than with the updated model with UFfse (updated fire spread estimations)."
  11: "The paper presents data on fire emissions and ecosystem carbon exchange, estimating\
    \ fire emissions of 2.4 Pg C per year during 1997\u20132015 and discussing potential\
    \ reductions due to socioeconomic factors."
