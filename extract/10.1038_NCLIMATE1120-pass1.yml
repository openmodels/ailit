Drivers of Risk:
  1: Milder winter temperatures and increased snow depth (which insulates the ground)
    leading to shorter winter road seasons. Declining sea ice concentration and thickness.
  3: Reduced sea-ice concentration and thickness.
Highlights:
  1: "All eight Arctic states are projected to suffer steep declines (\u221211 to\
    \ \u221282%) in accessibility inland, driven by lost potential for winter road\
    \ construction caused by milder winters and deeper snow accumulation.  The Northern\
    \ Sea Route, Arctic Bridge and North Pole routes are projected to become fully\
    \ accessible from July\u2013September, averaging\u223C11, 15 and 16 days to traverse,\
    \ respectively, whereas the Northwest Passage will not."
  3: Reduced sea-ice concentration and thickness will cause Canada, Greenland, Russia,
    and the United States to experience sizable increases in maritime access to their
    offshore EEZs, nearly year-round, using ships with light icebreaking capability.
Methodology:
  1: Uses the Arctic Transport Accessibility Model (ATAM) which integrates climate
    model projections of air temperature, snow depth, and sea ice with static datasets
    on land cover, topography, hydrography, built infrastructure, and locations of
    human settlements. Results are applicable to mid-century (specifically, uses the
    timeframe 2045-2059 for some projections).
  3: "ATAM simulations project faster travel speeds within regions already accessible\
    \ today. To isolate climate change impacts, all human settlements and permanent\
    \ transportation infrastructure are assumed unchanging between the two time periods.\
    \ By mid-century, dark tones in continental interiors re\uFB02ect longer TTNS\
    \ owing to reduced winter road potential. In oceans, lighter tones re\uFB02ect\
    \ shorter shipping TTNS owing to reduced sea ice."
More Notes:
  3: The analysis focuses on travel time to nearest settlement (TTNS) as a metric,
    using multi-modal transportation.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Potential impacts to resource development, construction projects, and community
    resupply in remote areas.
  3: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: "Projects that the Tibbitt\u2013Contwoyto winter road will lose ~17% of its operating\
    \ season between 2008 and 2020. Projects between +5 to +28% to existing and +11\
    \ to +37% of theoretical offshore exclusive economic zones of Canada, Greenland,\
    \ Russia and the US."
  3: "NP experiences the largest gains relative to baseline (+56%), becoming 100%\
    \ accessible to Type A vessels with an average projected transit time of \u223C\
    16 days by mid-century. The NSR, only 86% accessible from July to September today,\
    \ is projected to become 100% accessible, with an average projected transit time\
    \ of\u223C11 days. The NWP, despite a +30% accessibility increase, is projected\
    \ to still obstruct Type A shipping by mid-century (82% accessible,slightly lessthantheNSRatbaseline).\
    \ The ArcticBridge (AB) route (Churchill to Murmansk) is 100% accessible in both\
    \ time scenarios with an average projected transit time of \u223C15 days"
