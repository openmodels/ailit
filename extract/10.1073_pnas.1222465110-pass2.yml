Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change scenarios leading to biophysical yield shocks; End-of-century
    radiative forcing of 8.5 W/m2; Lack of incremental CO2 fertilization
  2: Climate change effects on agricultural productivity (biophysical crop yield changes).
  3: Initial productivity shock (YEXO) due to climate change, economic model, crop
    type, region, scenario, GCM, crop model
  4: Exogenous yield shocks (YEXO) due to climate change, representing the direct
    impact of climate change on agricultural yields.
  5: Climate change impacts trigger responses like intensified management practices,
    area expansion, and altered trade patterns.
Highlights:
  1: Agricultural production, crop-land area, trade, and prices show the greatest
    degree of variability in response to climate change, and consumption the lowest;
    Model structure and specification, ease of land use conversion, intensification,
    and trade are sources of differences in model results
  2: Economic models redistribute the effects of climate change. Variability of production
    is more heterogeneous than consumption.
  3: Economic models are the largest contributor to variability in final yield, agricultural
    area, production, and consumption. Variability in the exogenous productivity shock
    (YEXO) is primarily due to crop model and region. Yield response varies by model
    with four different patterns. Area responses also differ substantially by model,
    with some showing an inverse relationship with productivity declines.
  4: The economic responses to climate change vary significantly across different
    models, indicating model uncertainty. Some models (GCAM and GLOBIOM) are more
    trade-responsive, reallocating production across regions, while others show intermediate
    or lower levels of trade responsiveness.
  5: Analyses that limit climate change impacts to biophysical effects alone underestimate
    our capacity to respond.
Methodology:
  1: Integration of climate, crop, and economic models; Investigating how nine global
    economic models of agriculture represent endogenous responses to seven standardized
    climate change scenarios; Application of biophysical shocks derived from IPCC's
    representative concentration pathway; Comparison of economic models
  2: Uses general circulation models (GCMs) to produce data on changes in climate
    variables, process-based crop models to simulate biophysical yield effects, and
    economic models (both computable general equilibrium and partial equilibrium)
    to simulate the responses of key economic variables to changes in biophysical
    crop yields; Analysis uses RCP 8.5 scenario; Results are for 2050.
  3: Analysis of variance to investigate contributions of sources of variation for
    response variables. Univariate regression lines of response variables against
    the initial shock (YEXO). Regression analysis to isolate the pure endogenous yield
    response (YENDO).
  4: The analysis uses nine different integrated assessment models (IAMs) - AIM, ENVISAGE,
    FARM, GCAM, GLOBIOM, GTEM, IMPACT, MAGNET, and MAgPIE - to simulate the economic
    impacts of climate-induced yield shocks on agricultural production, trade, consumption,
    and prices across 13 regions, four crops, and seven scenarios. Univariate regressions
    are performed to quantify the relationship between YEXO and each outcome variable.
More Notes:
  1: Study identifies where models disagree on the relative responses to climate shocks
    and highlights research activities needed to improve the representation of agricultural
    adaptation responses to climate change.
  2: The paper focuses on the endogenous responses of economic models to climate change
    impacts on agriculture. Economic models capture effects such as supply curve shifts,
    price changes, and changes in consumption and production.
  3: The slope of the regression lines represents the local response and can be roughly
    interpreted as an elasticity. The intercept indicates that a local change arises
    from effects elsewhere via price effects transmitted through international trade.
  4: The regressions provide information on both the magnitude (slope) and the baseline
    (intercept) effects of yield shocks on the economic variables.
  5: Models show significant variation in responses to climate change due to differences
    in model structure and parameterization.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Agricultural production, crop-land area, trade, prices, and consumption
  2: Changes in consumption, crop area, producer prices, and net imports relative
    to reference scenario production.
  3: Productivity, agricultural area, production, trade share, consumption, yields,
    price
  4: Changes in total agricultural production (YTOT), endogenous yield response (YENDO),
    area of cultivated land (AREA), agricultural production (PROD), trade responsiveness
    (TRSH), consumption (CONS), and agricultural commodity prices (PRICE).
Quantitative material:
  1: Mean biophysical yield effect with no incremental CO2 fertilization is a 17%
    reduction globally by 2050 relative to a scenario with unchanging climate; Endogenous
    economic responses reduce yield loss to 11%, increase area of major crops by 11%,
    and reduce consumption by 3%
  2: A 17% mean decline in biophysical crop yield due to climate change. Initial effect
    of climate change that reduces yields leads to a mean area increase of 11%. The
    combined yield decline and area increase result in a mean decline in production
    of only 2%. Consumption also declines only slightly (mean decline of 3%). Average
    producer prices increase by 20%.
  3: Standard deviations of initial productivity shock (YEXO) is 13%, equilibrium
    yield (YTOT) is 17%, agricultural area (AREA), production (PROD), and trade share
    (TRSH) are 25-26%, and consumption (CONS) is 6%. Table 1 provides partition of
    the sum of squares and analysis of variance. Some models compensate to 65% or
    32% of the initial YEXO shock.
  4: Table 2 presents regressions of economic responses to climate change shock (YEXO)
    by model, including intercept and slope values for each outcome of interest (YTOT,
    YENDO, AREA, PROD, TRSH, CONS, PRICE) for each of the nine models (AIM, ENVISAGE,
    FARM, GCAM, GLOBIOM, GTEM, IMPACT, MAGNET, MAgPIE). Also Figure 3 illustrates
    economic responses of model variables against YEXO, by model.
