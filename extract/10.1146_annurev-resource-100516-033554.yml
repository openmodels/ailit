Drivers of Risk:
  2: Changing climatic conditions, adaptation gaps, behavioral barriers, market failures.
  4: Climate risks
  8: Climate vulnerability in one sector spilling over into others through the supply
    chain; adaptation measures in one sector impacting others (e.g., migration); land
    lost to coastal inundation, droughts and floods, and changes in water supply.
  10: Sea level rise, climate uncertainty, flood risk.
  16: Climate change, timing of adaptation investments (early vs. later).
  18: Climate change impacts determined by development decisions.
  20: The type of economic development (e.g., shift from agriculture to industry/services)
    impacts vulnerability. Urban development along vulnerable coastlines or in flood-prone
    areas.
  22: Exogenous change in climate.
  23: Climate change.
  25: "More extreme forms of climate change, such as those associated with 3-4\xBA\
    C of mean surface warming."
Highlights:
  2: Adaptation requires knowledge, planning, coordination and foresight and is not
    autonomous. There are important adaptation gaps that require policy intervention.
    Decisions on industrial strategy, urban planning and infrastructure investment
    all have strong bearing on future vulnerability to climate change.
  4: Adaptation can be very effective at reducing climate risks, but there are difficulties;
    an economy-wide approach to climate resilience is needed; public policy is important
    for facilitating sound adaptation.
  5: Early IAMs indirectly incorporated adaptation costs and benefits into damage
    functions, representing the least-cost combination of adaptation costs and residual
    damages. These models often assumed optimal adaptation, allowing modellers to
    focus on other issues like optimal emission reduction or the social cost of carbon.
  8: Application of economy-wide models to adaptation is relatively rare, and knowledge
    gaps remain. Indirect effects of climate change may dominate the direct effects
    in some sectors. Short-term costs of climate shocks are not well captured by general
    equilibrium models.
  16: Bringing an adaptation investment forward is beneficial if the NPV of acting
    early is greater than the NPV of acting later. The formula highlights that early
    adaptation is favoured when early benefits are significant, when the discounted
    value of later benefits from early adaptation exceeds the discounted value of
    later benefits from late adaptation, and when the discounted cost of late adaptation
    exceeds the cost of early adaptation.
  18: Adaptation is entwined with broader economic decisions and may have implications
    for macroeconomic aggregates like output and investment.
  20: The type of development matters for resilience to climate risks. The net effect
    of economic development on vulnerability and exposure is ambiguous.
  22: Policy makers generally think of adaptation and mitigation as complements. In
    strict economic terms adaptation and mitigation are more likely to be substitutes.
    An effective policy response to climate change involves both adaptation and mitigation;
    either measure on its own would be insufficient to curtail the negative effects
    of climate change.
  23: There is little agreement on the relative effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation,
    making the right mix difficult to determine. Proactive adaptation (building adaptive
    capacity early) is recommended. Aggregate research on the mitigation-adaptation
    trade-off has leveled off. There is continued interest in institutional and governance
    issues related to the adaptation-mitigation trade-off in particular sectors.
  25: "Need to understand adaptation strategies for higher levels of warming (3-4\xBA\
    C) and how to switch adaptation regimes."
Methodology:
  2: Literature review of the economic and analytical challenges of adaptation to
    climate change.
  4: Discusses integrated assessment models, econometric models, economy-wide models,
    and various decision-making tools used in adaptation economics.
  5: Discusses Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) which are global, dynamic, and
    long-term models simulating the interplay of economic and biophysical processes
    related to climate change. These models aim to represent the full chain from economic
    activity to emissions, temperature changes, physical impacts, and socio-economic
    consequences.
  8: 'System-wide models (computable general equilibrium models, macroeconomic models,
    input/output analysis) are used to analyze economy-wide effects and combined effects
    of adaptation. General equilibrium models measure long-term impacts in a static
    comparison of equilibria. '

    Analysis (MCA), Iterative Risk Management (IRM), Real Options Analysis (ROA),
    Robust Decision Making (RDM), Portfolio Analysis (PA), Rule Based Decision Support.
    Adaptation pathways can be applied to identify options.
  16: Compares the NPV of adaptation investments at different times (early vs. later)
    using a stylized setup with two time periods and three NPV components (costs,
    early benefits, later benefits).
  18: General equilibrium analysis.
  20: The supply and demand diagram illustrates the economic impacts of climate protection,
    showing how shifts in the curves represent changes in costs and adaptation levels.
  22: Integrated assessment models are suited to study the trade-off between adaptation
    costs, mitigation costs, and residual damages.
  23: Integrated assessment models are used to analyze the adaptation-mitigation choice,
    considering factors like the discount rate and climate uncertainty. These models
    distinguish between proactive (stock) and reactive (flow) adaptation.
  25: Policy evaluation of adaptation measures under different climate scenarios.
More Notes:
  8: Standard input-output tables or social accounting matrices may need additional
    assumptions to project the effects of climate change. There is a suspicion that
    for some sectors indirect risks, and therefore the adaptation needs, dominate
    the direct effects of climate change.
  23: The paper references various studies, which may contain quantitative information
    or further insights on the topics discussed.
  25: The paper identifies a gap in empirical evidence regarding adaptation to extreme
    climate change scenarios.
