Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (including sea-level rise), human factors (e.g., large population,
    rapid socio-economic growth, subsidence from excessive groundwater extraction),
    and natural factors (land subsidence) exacerbate flood risks.
  4: Climate change
  7: The 1993 Mississippi River flood.
  8: Increased frequency of intensive rainfall events in Japan, typhoons, torrential
    rains, snowmelt, tsunami, fast sprawling development (Houston), loss of wetland
    storage, expansion of impermeable surfaces (Houston), lack of investment in flood
    defence infrastructure (Houston), climate change.
  14: Urbanization, rapid development, typhoons, increased population density, climate
    change raising sea levels and making storm surges more hazardous, deforestation
    due to the pressure of economic growth, lack of consideration to urban floods.
  15: Climate change is increasing the frequency, intensity, and magnitude of storms
    (typhoons), intense rainfall events, and sea surges, increasing flood risk.
Highlights:
  1: "SFRM aims to deliver sound \uFB02ood management practices considering socio-economic\
    \ and environmental concerns."
  7: The 1993 Mississippi River flood, causing over USD15 billion in damage, prompted
    a review of flood management approaches in the US.
  15: "Traditional hard-engineering flood defenses are increasingly unaffordable and\
    \ a wider package of measures is needed to address flood risk.  Asian coastal\
    \ megacities may find it advantageous to recognise wider international experience\
    \ and develop coping strategies that re\uFB02ect a greater acceptance of options\
    \ of living with \uFB02ood risk rather than assume that all such risk can be engineered\
    \ away."
Methodology:
  1: Reviews past and current flood management experiences from flood defence to SFRM
    in four developed countries (UK, Netherlands, US, and Japan) to highlight lessons
    for coastal megacities in development.
More Notes:
  1: "The paper explores how policymakers can adopt \u201Cmixed options\u201D to move\
    \ towards long-term thinking about sustainability with social, economic, and environmental\
    \ considerations in flood management."
  4: The UK still has room to improve in aspects such as cost-effectiveness and time
    effectiveness and in its complex governance structure such as the fragmented responsibilities
    across institutions and stakeholders in UK flood management.
  7: The Galloway Report, prompted by the 1993 flood, suggested avoiding floodplain
    development unless no alternatives existed.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Discusses integrating economic themes into flood risk management (FRM) practices
    within Sustainable Flood Risk Management (SFRM).
  4: Forecast flood damage in England and Wales is currently GBP1.4 billion annually
    but is expected to rise to as much as GBP27 billion by 2100.
  7: Economic damage due to the 1993 Mississippi River flood was over USD15 billion.
  8: Economic losses due to flooding in Japan in 2000 (Nagoya) were approximately
    JYP978 billion (ca. USD9.57 billion).
  14: USD 46.5 billion of damage and 680 deaths in Thailand due to the 2011 flood;
    insurance losses from Japanese factories in Thailand (Toyota, Honda, Nissan) of
    USD10 billion to 15 billion from the same flood.
  15: Economic losses due to floods are a key concern.
Quantitative material:
  4: 'Current flood damage: GBP1.4 billion annually; Forecast flood damage by 2100:
    GBP27 billion'
  7: Over USD15 billion in economic damage due to the 1993 Mississippi River flood.
  8: 'Economic losses due to flooding in Nagoya, Japan in 2000: JYP978 billion (ca.
    USD9.57 billion).'
  14: USD 46.5 billion of damage and 680 deaths in Thailand due to the 2011 flood;
    insurance losses from Japanese factories in Thailand (Toyota, Honda, Nissan) of
    USD10 billion to 15 billion from the same flood; Shanghai authority acted to raise
    the flood protection level of coastal defence from a 1-in-100-year to 1-in-1000-year
    protection level during the early 2000s; relocation of over 1 million people away
    from frequent flood zones in Vietnam.
  15: Major urban drainage systems in Singapore have been improved from 1 in 50 years
    to 1 in 100 years, whilst Guangzhou and Shenzhen only have a 1-in-20-year return
    period protection against typhoon and sea surges.
