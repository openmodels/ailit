Drivers of Risk:
  5: Fluvial flooding, intense rainfall, tropical cyclones, storm surges, compound
    flooding
  6: Increased development and climate change likely to increase flood risk in U.S.
    coastal areas.
  7: The 1993 Mississippi River flood, spanning over 1200km of the river's length
    and about 840000km2 in area, is identified as a significant event that prompted
    a review of flood management approaches.
  8: In the USA, the drivers of risk include sprawling development, loss of wetlands,
    expansion of impermeable surfaces, and lack of investment in flood defense infrastructure.
    In Japan, the drivers include frequent flood hazards due to topographic features,
    short steep rivers, increased frequency of intensive rainfall events (> 50mm/h
    and >100mm/h), typhoons, torrential rains, snowmelt, and tsunami.
  10: Floods, future climate projections impacting precipitation and discharge ratios.
  11: Floods
  13: Rapid land-use changes transformed green spaces into urban areas, but land drainage
    and flood measures were unable to cope with the urban runoff.
  14: Deforestation in Ho Chi Minh City exacerbated flood risk.
  15: Frequency, intensity, and magnitude of storms (typhoons), intense rainfall events,
    and sea surges
Evaluation overview:
  5: Deaths and economic losses due to flooding
  7: Economic damage from the 1993 Mississippi River flood is mentioned, amounting
    to over USD 15 billion.
  8: The page discusses flood risk management and preparedness in the USA and Japan,
    focusing on property damage, economic losses, and fatalities.

  15: No relevant information
Highlights:
  5: The United States regularly experiences severe flooding, resulting in significant
    deaths and economic losses. Tropical cyclones are a major driver of flood-related
    damages.
  6: Federal and state governments in the U.S. have a shared burden of flood management
    and insurance provisions.
  7: The 1993 Mississippi River flood highlighted the limitations of hard-engineering
    solutions for flood management and led to the Galloway Report, which advocated
    for avoiding development in floodplains and managing them as part of the natural
    ecosystem.
  8: "The USA has adopted a \u201Cmixed-options\u201D approach to dealing with rising\
    \ flood risk, but not all cities are adequately prepared (e.g., Houston). Japan\
    \ has frequent flood hazards due to topographic features and an increasing trend\
    \ in intensive rainfall events."
  10: 'Japan is implementing flood resilience strategies including relocation, setback,
    and fluvial flood prediction with future climate projection. Sustainable Flood
    Risk Management (SFRM) is evolving, influenced by the three pillars of sustainability:
    social, economic, and environmental.'
  11: Addresses issues in understanding flood awareness; current cost justification
    and post-flood impacts histories. Discusses social justice in FRM and flood risk,
    flood hazard mapping, and cost-benefit analysis in flood infrastructure investment
    and flood insurance.
  13: Flood management practices before the 1990s in these cities were mainly driven
    by flood control and defence measures.
  14: The 2011 Bangkok flood highlighted the chain effect of large floods and influenced
    global insurers' and governments' understanding of flood risk.
  15: Traditional flood protection approaches are becoming financially unsustainable
    for Asian coastal megacities. Existing levels of protection are not enough in
    the face of climate change. A shift towards Sustainable Flood Risk Management
    (SFRM) is needed, incorporating a wider range of measures beyond hard-engineering
    defenses.
Methodology:
  10: Analysis considers future climate scenarios to predict flood risk in basins
    from 2080-2099.
  11: Comparison of sustainable flood risk management (SFRM) by four countries (Japan,
    Netherlands, UK, USA).
  13: The paper discusses the progress of flood management strategies in Asian coastal
    cities from the pre-1990s (flood protection) era through the 2000s (flood risk
    management) and post-2000s (sustainable flood risk management) eras.
  14: This section provides a comparative overview of flood risk management approaches
    in various Asian cities over time, focusing on the evolution from engineering-focused
    solutions to more integrated and socio-economically aware strategies.
  15: The paper reviews sustainable flood risk management (SFRM) approaches, comparing
    experiences from four countries to provide lessons for Asian coastal megacities.
    It advocates for moving beyond traditional hard-engineering defenses towards a
    wider package of measures including soft engineering, land-use planning, and social
    strategies.
More Notes:
  7: The page focuses on the US response to flooding, particularly the shift towards
    more comprehensive flood management strategies after the 1993 Mississippi River
    flood.
  11: Focuses on strengths and weaknesses of practices including social and environmental
    impacts, cost-benefit analysis, flood insurance, and institutional arrangements
    in the four countries.
  13: The table provides a summary of flood management practices in several Asian
    cities (Jakarta, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Singapore) across
    different eras, relative to the dominant flood paradigm in the West.
  15: The paper emphasizes the importance of considering social and environmental
    perspectives in flood risk reduction, including the needs of vulnerable communities
    and stakeholder engagement.

Quantitative material:
  5: Average of 87 deaths per year from flooding between 1989 and 2018. 29 flood events
    between 1989 and 2018 resulted in over USD1 billion in economic losses, with an
    average event cost of USD4.3 million. 42 tropical cyclones during the same period
    with an average event cost of USD21.9 billion.
  7: "The 1993 Mississippi River flood covered over 1200km of the river\u2019s length\
    \ and about 840000km2 in area and resulted in over USD15 billion in economic damage."
  8: Mentions that intensive rainfall events (> 50mm/h) in Japan have increased in
    frequency by about 50% and those > 100mm/h have more than doubled over the last
    30 years. In 2000 in Nagoya, pluvial flooding killed 18 and economic losses were
    about JYP978 billion (ca. USD9.57 billion). In 2004 the Niigata-Fukushima flood
    killed 20 and inundated 26000 properties.
  10: Presents a table with lower, middle, and upper flood predictions for basins
    from 2080 to 2099, including precipitation ratio, discharge ratio, and performance
    ratio of flood control works.
  13: reduced flood-prone areas from 6900ha in the 1960s to 207ha in the 1990s (Singapore)
  14: Insurance losses solely from Japanese factories in the 2011 Bangkok flood totaled
    USD10 billion to 15 billion.
  15: Major urban drainage systems in Singapore have been improved from 1 in 50 years
    to 1 in 100 years, whilst Guangzhou and Shenzhen only have a 1-in-20-year return
    period protection against typhoon and sea surges. Fatalities occurred in Hong
    Kong in 2010 when pluvial flooding overwhelmed the 1-in-50-year protection level
    defenses, whilst Shenzhen only has a 1-in-20-year return period protection against
    typhoons and sea surges.
