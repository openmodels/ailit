Drivers of Risk:
  1: Species range shifts, harmful algal blooms, marine heatwaves, low oxygen events,
    coral bleaching, hurricanes, changes in marine species ranges, diversity and abundance,
    species migration pathways, and habitat distributions; increasing frequency and
    intensity of storms.
  3: Discusses climate impacts and shocks such as heatwaves, with focus on fisheries.
  5: "Harmful algal blooms, disease outbreaks, changes in water quality, and extreme\
    \ weather events are identified as environmental risks. Anomalously warm ocean\
    \ conditions and strong El Ni\xF1o conditions can drive these events."
  6: Climate shocks, marine heatwaves, changes in ocean properties (temperature, oxygen
    levels, nutrient availability).
  7: Climate shocks such as prolonged sea surface temperature increases and storms
    are identified as drivers of risk.
  8: Marine climate shocks (e.g., marine heatwaves leading to coral bleaching, cyclones)
  9: Marine heatwaves, harmful algal blooms, non-linear dynamics in marine food webs,
    and shifts in species ranges due to climate change.
  10: Marine heatwaves, hypoxic events, harmful algal blooms, climate shocks risk
    pushing industries to collapse
Evaluation overview:
  1: Economic risk to blue food industries (fisheries and aquaculture); food and income
    security of people who rely on blue foods; resilience of blue food supply chains
    and coastal communities.
  3: Discusses resilience using insurance as a tool to mitigate risk and facilitate
    recovery from loss in fisheries.
  4: Economic losses engendered by marine climate shocks result in less capital to
    pay for key necessities, including the means to adapt to future shocks.
  5: Mortality of fish stocks and economic losses for fisheries and aquaculture operations
    are evaluated.
  6: Fishery and aquaculture production, specifically revenue losses.
  7: This page primarily focuses on insurance as a resilience mechanism for blue food
    producers (fishers and aquaculture operators) facing climate shocks affecting
    production.
  8: Economic resilience and income diversity of coastal communities involved in blue
    foods industries (commercial fisheries, aquaculture, marine tourism, recreational
    fisheries).
  9: Discusses insurance as a tool to reduce risk from extreme marine climate events
    and improve the sustainability of the environment and resource users.
  10: Economic impacts of marine climate shocks on blue-foods sector, economic resilience
    in fisheries and aquaculture, and adoption of sustainable practices.
Highlights:
  1: Financial risk management tools, particularly insurance, are central to bolstering
    the resilience of blue food supply chains and coastal communities to climate shocks;
    New forms of insurance, such as ocean-index or parametric insurance, have the
    potential to help incentivize sustainable use of living marine resources and strengthen
    the economic resilience of coastal communities to climate change.
  3: Insurance can help transfer risk and help economics when storms affect fisheries,
    but issues like adverse selection and moral hazard need to be managed. Reinsurance
    reduces the potential financial shock for insurance companies. Resilience can
    be achieved through adaptation.
  4: Government disaster relief is now used regularly to help mitigate the economic
    impacts of marine climate shocks; however, payments are made many years after
    the event and cover only a fraction of the costs... the current approach to government
    disaster relief for marine climate shocks will not work in the future.
  5: Insurance for aquaculture is less common than for agriculture, especially among
    small to medium-sized operations. Marine climate shocks can still be detrimental
    even with insurance. Data scarcity and difficulty in verifying stocking levels
    make pricing insurance challenging for aquaculture. Parametric insurance could
    help expand coverage options.
  6: Attributing a drop in fishery or aquaculture production to a specific marine
    shock is challenging due to open ocean boundaries, animal movement, and multiple
    stressors. Moral hazard and adverse selection present core challenges to insurance
    viability in fisheries and aquaculture.
  8: Insurance programs, government subsidies, and supportive policies can increase
    the resilience of blue food supply chains and coastal communities to climate change
    impacts. Insurance design should consider the complex income landscapes and diversity
    of employment in coastal communities to avoid reducing natural adaptive capacity.
    Long-term climate change necessitates risk adjustments in insurance policies.
  9: Insurance can help conserve capital reserves during climate shocks, bolster adaptive
    capacity, and facilitate transitions to new locations or sources of income. Rising
    insurance costs can signal the need for alternative risk management measures.
    Insurance mechanisms should provide economic resilience in the near term, combined
    with support for long-term planning. Government subsidies and support from non-traditional
    sources may be needed.
  10: Financial risk management tools like parametric insurance can increase economic
    resilience and incentivize sustainable practices in the blue-foods sector. Collective
    action and responsibility through financial incentives could improve climate change
    coping ability.
Methodology:
  3: Examines insurance and reinsurance mechanisms, including parametric insurance
    and the concepts of moral hazard and adverse selection, to understand how risk
    is transferred and managed in fisheries.
  6: Discusses challenges in pricing the risk of climate shocks due to limited observations,
    complex teleconnections, and difficulties in attributing production drops to specific
    marine shocks.
  7: The page discusses indemnity and parametric insurance, including cooperative
    and mutual fund approaches to insurance.
  8: Discusses the role of insurance and government policies in mitigating the impacts
    of climate shocks on coastal communities and blue food supply chains. Considers
    potential unintended consequences of insurance programs.
  9: Suggests a multi-stage process for implementing marine climate shock insurance,
    including design concepts, demonstration projects, and building a capital pool.
  10: Proposes an insurance-based risk reduction approach for marine resource users
    exposed to climate shocks, drawing analogies and lessons from the agricultural
    sector
More Notes:
  1: Suggests collaboration between the insurance industry and marine sectors, fostered
    through collaboration with governments, academics, and NGOs.
  3: The page touches upon the concepts of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity
    as components of vulnerability and resilience within the context of climate change
    impacts on fisheries.
  4: Marine insurance potentially provides an alternative mechanism (to federal disaster
    relief) to reduce the vulnerability of these small fisheries to these shocks.
  5: The page discusses the challenges of creating insurance policies for common pool
    resources like wild fisheries. It contrasts wild-capture fisheries with aquaculture,
    noting aquaculture more closely resembles a private good.
  6: The accuracy of ocean forecasts, understanding of causal pathways, and ability
    to predict fish population dynamics and fisheries/aquaculture production are improving.
  8: The paper emphasizes the connectivity of supply chains and the importance of
    protecting the base of blue food supply chains.
  9: Discusses the potential for insurance to prop up failing industries and the need
    to implement insurance mechanisms that incentivize shifts to more viable alternatives.
    Also mentions the role of reinsurance and the potential for parametric insurance
    to act as disaster relief.
  10: The strategy of tying financial tools to geographic regions or producer groups
    is highlighted. Also, the importance of robust scientific data and inclusive engagement
    of stakeholders is stressed.
Quantitative material:
  5: The 2016 Chilean algal bloom event resulted in an export loss of ~$US$800 million.
  8: Tropical Cyclone Winston led to nearly F$600 million in losses in Fiji due to
    changes in the economic flows of the production of goods and services, with F$120
    million from lost tourism alone.
