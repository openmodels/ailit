Drivers of Risk:
  4: Marine climate shocks (e.g., harmful algal blooms, marine heatwaves, hurricanes);
    Climate change (increasing frequency of intense hurricanes).
  9: Extreme marine climate events (marine heatwaves, harmful algal blooms), non-linear
    changes in marine food web productivity, climate change impacts on fisheries and
    aquaculture, spatial shifts in marine species ranges.
  10: Marine heatwaves, hypoxic events, harmful algal blooms, and other climate shocks
Highlights:
  4: Climate shocks cause significant economic losses in fisheries; Government disaster
    relief is often delayed and insufficient; Marine insurance is a potential alternative
    to disaster relief for mitigating climate shock impacts.
  9: Insurance can help actors conserve capital reserves and bolster adaptive capacity;
    insurance premiums can send a strong market signal that adaptation is required;
    insurance can facilitate managed retreat of income landscapes.
  10: Parametric insurance and other financial risk management tools can incentivize
    sustainable practices and protect coastal communities from climate shocks in the
    blue-food sector.
Methodology:
  9: Conceptual framework for implementation of marine climate shock insurance, involving
    stages from design to capital access, ultimately leading to reduced financial
    loss.
  10: Proposes an insurance-based risk reduction approach for marine resource users
    exposed to climate shocks.
More Notes:
  4: The paper discusses differences in coping mechanisms for climate shocks based
    on the nature of the blue-food sector (aquaculture vs. wild fisheries, commercial
    vs. artisan fisheries).
  9: Rising insurance costs can be an indicator that alternative risk management measures
    should be taken.
  10: The paper suggests tying financial tools like parametric insurance to specific
    geographic regions and/or groups of producers (e.g., fishery cooperatives).
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  4: Direct revenue losses in fisheries due to climate shocks; Economic losses in
    fishing communities; Costs of disaster relief funding; Impacts on commercial landings.
  9: Financial loss for resource users; livelihood and environmental sustainability.
  10: Increase economic resilience in fisheries and aquaculture; Protection of coastal
    communities against the worst impacts of climate change; Long-term survival and
    prosperity of blue-food sectors under climate change
Quantitative material:
  4: California Dungeness crab landings reached only 52% of the average catch, resulting
    in US$97.5 million in direct revenue losses; $27.3 million in federal disaster
    relief funding was allocated for the Dungeness crab fishery closure; Fisheries
    in Puerto Rico experienced a 20% fall in commercial landings, resulting in an
    estimated US$17.8 million in economic losses; US Federal Emergency Management
    Agency to provide US$1.8 million in grants to fishers in Puerto Rico.
