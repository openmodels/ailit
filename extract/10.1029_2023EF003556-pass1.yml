Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changing frequency of extreme rain events in the Indian river basins (IRBs).
  2: "Anthropogenic activities would cause an increase in the average global surface\
    \ temperature of 0.8\xB0C\u20131.3\xB0C"
  5: Changes in extreme precipitation (intensity and frequency of hydroclimate extremes)
    are drivers of agriculture stress and flood risk.
  8: Increased precipitation and resulting flood conditions in specific river basins;
    Variations in human activities, such as energy consumption and agricultural practices,
    which influence greenhouse gas emissions and land use changes.
  9: Projected changes in precipitation (increase or decrease) in various river basins
    of India under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) due to climate change.
    Emission scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5
  10: Changes in mean precipitation, extreme precipitation events (floods and droughts),
    and extreme temperature increases, influenced by factors like El Nino Southern
    Oscillation (ENSO), high surface pressure over the Tibet region.
  11: Changes in extreme precipitation events (Rx5day), consecutive dry days (CDD),
    and consecutive wet days (CWD) driven by climate change under different SSP scenarios
    (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5).
  16: Changes in precipitation patterns, specifically increases in extreme rainfall
    and shifts from dryness to wetness, driven by different climate scenarios (SSPs).
Highlights:
  1: Extreme rainfall is projected to intensify in the future but decrease in areal
    mean rainfall. Central and west Indian river basins will be more vulnerable. Lower
    Ganga basin will experience agricultural drought in near future due to decreasing
    areal mean rainfall.
  2: India is one of the world's most vulnerable countries to hydro-climatic extremes,
    such as droughts and floods, which affect the Agricultural production of the nation.
  5: The study focuses on extreme precipitation indices (ETCCDI), Standardized Precipitation
    Index (SPI), and Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) to examine precipitation extremes
    and drought events.
  8: Central Indian River Basins (IRBs) are expected to experience a significant increasing
    trend in precipitation; Western Ghats areas are projected to have substantial
    increases in precipitation, especially under high emission scenarios; Monthly
    precipitation data is more sensitive to human activity variations compared to
    daily data.
  9: Precipitation is projected to change significantly across various Indian river
    basins, with spatial and temporal variability dependent on the emission scenario.
    Western river basins generally show increased daily precipitation, while eastern
    ghats show decreases in the near future, followed by increases in the far future.
  10: The lower Ganga river basin is projected to experience a decrease in monthly
    mean precipitation of approximately 7-11 mm/day in the near future, potentially
    leading to drought conditions.
  11: Extreme precipitation events are projected to increase significantly in several
    Indian river basins (Indus, Ganga, western Ghats, central IRBs). Consecutive dry
    days are projected to increase in Rajasthan. Consecutive wet days are projected
    to increase in northeast river basins and western Ghats.
  16: Extreme rainfall is projected to increase and intensify throughout the 21st
    century in many Indian River Basins (IRBs), with greater increases after the 2040s
    and unprecedented levels by the end of the century without strong mitigation.
Methodology:
  1: Evaluated the performance of 12 Global Circulation Models from the Coupled Model
    Intercomparison Project Phase 6 using India Meteorological Department observed
    data, applying linear and quantile bias correction approaches.
  2: This study used the most recent Earth system models (ESMs) and extensive climate
    model experiments from the sixth phase of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
    (CMIP) to examine the changes in extremes.
  5: Uses ETCCDI indices to estimate changes in hydro-climate extremes in low to high-emission
    scenarios using bias-corrected CMIP6 data sets and a multi-model ensemble (MME)
    approach. Analyzes future changes using indices like Consecutive dry days (CDD),
    Consecutive wet days (CWD), and maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation (rx5day).
  8: Analysis based on different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) emission scenarios
    (SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5) from 2021 to 2100.
  9: "Climate model projections of precipitation changes across India for near- (2021\u2013\
    2040), mid- (2041\u20132060), and far-future (2081\u20132100) relative to a 1995\u2013\
    2014 baseline under different SSPs; significance testing performed"
  10: Analysis of monthly mean precipitation climatology for the monsoon season (JJAS)
    under low (SSP1-2.6) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios using climate models
    from CMIP6.
  11: Analysis of observed (1951-2021) and historical (1951-2014) data, alongside
    projected (2021-2100) climate scenarios (SSPs) to assess spatial changes in extreme
    precipitation events. SSP scenarios factor in different emissions and land use
    changes.
More Notes:
  1: The study identifies hotspot regions for future urban flooding and emphasizes
    the need for adaptation and mitigation strategies to reduce hydroclimate vulnerability.
  2: The paper focuses on the impact of hydro-climatic extremes on India, particularly
    droughts and floods and on Indian River Basins.
  5: The study uses SPI to estimate the intensity of drought events and a gamma distribution
    to grid-level monthly rainfall values to analyse drought events. A 3-month time
    scale is used to analyse spatial changes in drought events for the near, mid,
    and far future.
  8: The paper focuses on precipitation trends in India and their spatial distribution
    across different river basins and emission scenarios; The effects of projected
    climate change are explicitly linked to population and potential flood risk in
    specific regions.
  9: Mentions challenges to adaptation and mitigation based on the projected precipitation
    changes.
  10: The analysis found that the moisture-weighed wind deviates from the Arabian
    Sea toward the Indian continent, which reveals more intensified moisture flux
    that causes more precipitation extreme events over WRF-TT and central India.
  11: The study focuses on spatial changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme
    weather events across India but does not explicitly model the economic consequences.
    The reference to the CWC (2021) report suggests an awareness of past flood events
    in the Ganga River Basin.
  16: The study supports basin-wise climate adaptation and mitigation strategies,
    including water and emergency services policies to minimize risk due to extremes.
