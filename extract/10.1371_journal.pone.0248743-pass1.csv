6,GDP Growth,Saudi Arabia,Time-series data (1990-2019),2019,No CC,unitless,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Page 15,"Impulse response function shows no detectable exogenous shock from any independent variable (including rainfall, temperature, and CO2 emissions) to GDP growth during the study period. Responses of rainfall, temperature and population to economic growth are 'not decisive' per the variance decomposition analysis."
