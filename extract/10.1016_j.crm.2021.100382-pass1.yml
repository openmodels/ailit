  10: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change impacts occurring remotely from the EU, transmitted across borders
    through trade, human security, and financial connections.
  4: Climate impacts in remote regions can have 'indirect cascading effects' across
    borders.
  6: Climate change impacts in certain geographic regions could have an 'outsize'
    impact on the sourcing of important materials.
  7: Rising temperatures, temperature shocks, and general shocks to agricultural production
    (e.g., extreme weather).
  8: Climate change; extreme weather events; droughts; decreased rainfall.
  9: Climatic pressures disrupt livelihoods and increase the risk of conflict.
  10: Climate change, humanitarian and political crises, localised crises and conflicts,
    changes in asylum, visa, and other immigration laws.
  11: Physical climate risk (disaster risk) and transition risk (climate policies,
    regulatory and technological shocks in the low-carbon transition) are identified
    as drivers of financial risks.
  12: Climate change impacts potentially affecting the value and performance of FDI
    in various sectors and regions.
  13: Physical climate shocks to manufacturing firms and other capital-intensive activities;
    Climate risk exposure in longer term debt-linked investments; Interconnectedness
    of EU financial actors.
  14: Lack of rainfall leading to drought in Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, causing
    a collapse in soy production.
  15: Extreme drought in Argentina impacting soy production; slow progress in production
    technologies; degraded environments associated with soy; low crop resilience;
    high global soy consumption driven by high meat consumption; lack of technological
    innovation in Argentina; lack of financial investment by Europe; widespread drought
    also affecting export markets in Paraguay and Brazil.
  17: Climate change events impacting imports of important commodities such as fossil
    fuels, minerals and agricultural products; climate dynamics emerging against a
    backdrop of pre-existing social and economic fragilities; EU's investment portfolio
    being unequally distributed globally with inadequate financial protections for
    future risk.
Highlights:
  2: "There is uncertainty about the dynamics of cross-border impact that will affect\
    \ whether the EU is in a relatively secure or vulnerable position in comparison\
    \ with other regions. Risk is likely to be focused in particular \u2018hotspots\u2019\
    ; defined geographies, for example, that produce materials for EU consumption\
    \ (e.g. Latin American soybean), hold financial investments (e.g. North America),\
    \ or are the foci for EU external action (e.g. the Middle East and North Africa\
    \ region)."
  6: EU27 is highly import-dependent on fertilizers and fossil fuels. Import sources
    are often concentrated in a few geographic locations, creating vulnerability to
    climate-related disruptions.
  7: EU27 is highly dependent on imports for horticulture, stimulants, tobacco, spices
    and pisciculture, fruits and aquatic resources, cereals, potassic fertilizers,
    and forestry products. Maritime trade via the Netherlands and Belgium (Rotterdam
    and Antwerp) is critically important.
  8: Climate change is likely to offset some progress made by the international community
    towards reducing hunger; indirect effects of climate change and extreme weather
    events increase the risk of violent conflicts; impacts of climate change on livestock,
    fisheries and pests are likely to be significantly underestimated.
  9: The social and economic context strongly influences the resilience (or vulnerability)
    of affected people.
  10: Migratory movements to the EU27 correlate strongly with total migration stock
    data and somewhat strongly with the mobility patterns of refugees and asylum seekers.
    Neighbourhood effects are important on migration to the EU, indicating where people
    displaced by climate change in those regions might move. ODA has flowed in large
    amounts to countries in the European neighbourhood and fragile countries, as well
    as to large South and East Asian countries and former colonies.
  11: Climate-related financial risks are expected to eventually cascade into public
    finance and sovereign risk.
  12: EU FDI is heavily concentrated in specific regions (Non-EU Europe, North America)
    and sectors (financial services, manufacturing, resource extraction), making these
    areas potentially vulnerable to climate-related disruptions.
  13: EU financial sector is particularly exposed to climate risks via portfolio investments,
    because the main investors in cross-border portfolio investments are EU financial
    actors.
  14: Regional droughts can trigger cascading impacts globally, affecting economic
    stability, policy measures, and food security.
  15: A climate shock in Argentina impacting soy production under SSP3 can trigger
    a cascade of consequences affecting food security, trade, migration, and political
    stability across multiple regions, eventually affecting EU supply chains, financial
    interests, foreign policy and human security.
  17: Impacts initially affecting one domain (trade, human security, finance) may
    have implications in another, heightening the challenge of developing effective
    policy responses.
Methodology:
  2: Macro-scale, risk-focused literature and data review.
  4: The literature review covers the prior decade (2010-2020), and the screening
    activity took place between January and March 2020.
  6: Analysis of EU27 import data for 2018 by commodity group, focusing on dependencies
    and sources. Examines import fluctuations over the past fifteen years. Identifies
    concentration of import sources and the importance of maritime routes. Analysis
    is primarily descriptive, based on trade data and patterns.
  7: The analysis involves a literature review to identify impacts relevant from a
    humanitarian or development perspective. Data on resource trade is used to analyze
    import dependencies. The time period depends on the data available for each sector
    (2015-2018).
  8: Literature review identifying relationships between climate change and various
    outcomes; focuses on impacts to agriculture, fisheries and pastoralism and its
    consequent effect on political stability.
  10: Analysis of migration patterns, refugee flows, and overseas development assistance
    (ODA) from EU27 countries. The analysis considers diasporic, linguistic, and historical
    ties.
  11: This is a review paper, so there is no novel methodology presented. It discusses
    various methodologies used in other studies, including climate stress tests, assessments
    of "climate value at risk," and input-output models.
  12: Analysis of FDI data from CDIS (presumably Coordinated Direct Investment Survey)
    to identify sectoral and regional concentrations of investment.
  14: Conceptual framework based on Carter et al. 2021, using a simplified representation
    of impact and response transmission pathways. Analysis is based on a potential
    future drought scenario inspired by SSP3.
  15: Scenario analysis based on SSP3; the scenario takes place in 2050.
  17: Review and analysis using both qualitative and quantitative sources to assess
    trade-, human security- and finance-related dynamics and EU connections with the
    rest of the world that may underpin cross-border transmission pathways for climate
    impact.
More Notes:
  2: The paper uses a conceptual example of soybean production in Argentina based
    on a historical drought event to illustrate that impact and response pathways
    linked to EU risk exposure may be complex.
  4: The analysis focuses on the EU27 as the importing bloc for trade and examines
    asylum dynamics, migration, and ODA spending.
  6: The reliance on maritime routes for imports means that disruptions to shipping
    due to climate change could have significant economic consequences for the EU27.
  7: The paper highlights the importance of maritime chokepoints for trade, but notes
    that EU countries are generally not among the most exposed or vulnerable, except
    for Cyprus. The Black Sea region is identified as strategically important but
    underinvested due to instability.
  8: The paper presents a figure showing import sources of selected agricultural commodities
    into the EU27 from non-EU27 countries in 2018.
  9: The page focuses more on the social consequences and drivers of climate change-related
    risks and does not directly quantify macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes. The
    mention of food production implies economic relevance, but it's not directly quantified.
  11: The paper notes a gap in research regarding the cross-border effects of climate-related
    financial impacts.
  12: The paper acknowledges limitations in assessing relative risk of debt vs. equity
    FDI positions due to data constraints. The paper highlights that climate-relevant
    economic sectors attract a significant portion of EU FDI.
  13: "The provided theoretical example of a future cross-border impact is informed\
    \ by a historical event \u2013 a drought in Argentina, which is a key exporter\
    \ of soybean to the EU. The interconnectedness of EU financial actors can lead\
    \ to amplified losses from negative climate-risk-related shocks."
  14: The study uses a case study of soy production in South America to illustrate
    the interconnectedness of climate risks and their transmission pathways. It suggests
    that adaptive responses are needed to ameliorate the recipient risk.
  15: The analysis is presented as a thought experiment to illustrate the potential
    for long and indirect impact transmission pathways and the need for policy responses
    that consider interactions between domains.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: The paper explores the potential impact transmission pathways between the EU
    and other world regions across trade, human security, and finance, seeking to
    understand how climate-related risk exposure may affect the EU.
  6: Implies potential for macroeconomic impacts on EU27 GDP and inflation due to
    import dependencies, particularly in food security-related agricultural products
    and energy sectors. Highlights potential price volatility in global commodity
    markets.
  7: The paper discusses risks to agriculture, fisheries and pastoralism due to changing
    climatic conditions, which can be linked to productivity losses and potential
    impacts on GDP.
  8: Reduced access to food due to rising food prices impacting buyers and importers;
    potential for indirect effects of climate change and extreme weather events on
    the risk of violent conflicts.
  9: "The implications of climatic impacts on human security, conflict, migration\
    \ and development will likely be larger if agriculture and other food production\u2019\
    s relative role is critically important as a source of nutrition and income."
  11: This paper does not focus on a specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcome, but
    rather broadly reviews climate-related financial risks and their potential impact
    on public finance and sovereign risk.
  12: FDI flows as a measure of economic exposure and potential vulnerability to climate-related
    risks.
  13: "Potential for amplified losses from negative climate-risk-related shocks to\
    \ EU financial actors and substantial systemic risk that may impair the EU financial\
    \ system\u2019s stability."
  14: Increased food prices, reduced meat and dairy supplies, increased food insecurity
    in the EU and MENA regions; Local commodity price changes and price escalations
    in the US.
  15: Meat production falls in lower-income countries; affluent populations can still
    consume imported meat, but the majority go without, leading to general food price
    rises; consumption inequality leads to insecurity and localized frustration with
    governments; protests and civil unrest are seen in regions of the world where
    existing inequalities are high; attractiveness of the EU and perception that inequalities
    are lower leads to attempts at outward migration from the MENA region; nationalist
    immigration policies within Europe create additional hardship for those seeking
    to migrate; Consequences for EU supply chains, financial interests, foreign policy
    and human security concerns may be felt.
  17: Cross-border transmission pathways for climate impacts, including trade, human
    security, and finance-related dynamics and EU connections with the rest of the
    world.
Quantitative material:
  2: The paper provides quantitative evidence of the extent and strength of connectivity
    between the EU and other world regions.
  6: Fossil fuels dominate EU27 imports (44%), followed by metals and minerals (16%),
    then agricultural products. The ten largest sources of material for oilseeds comprise
    87% of extra-EU imports in 2018, for cereals it is 92% and for horticulture products
    80%. Specific breakdowns are also provided for fertilizers.
  7: Provides data on the relative contribution of imports to material dependency
    (imports plus production) in the EU27 for various sectors including fossil fuels,
    agricultural products, fertilizers, forestry products, and metals and minerals.
    Examples include Horticulture (mostly imported at 90%), Oilseeds (95% production),
    and Potassic fertilizers (almost entirely imported at 90%).
  12: EU27 outward FDI was 10 trillion USD in 2018, concentrated in Non-EU European
    Countries (39%) and North and Central America (31%). The US is the largest recipient
    of EU FDI (24% of total stock), followed by the United Kingdom (21%) and Switzerland
    (11%). Sectors receiving EU FDI, like financial services, manufacturing, telecommunications,
    mining, and energy, are listed with regional breakdowns.
  13: "Total extra-EU portfolio investment of EU27 countries amounts to approximately\
    \ 9.8 trillion USD, 44% of the total is in North and Central America (3.9 trillion\
    \ USD in the US), 18% of total cross-border portfolio instruments of the EU27\
    \ are held in the UK, 5% in Japan, 3% in the Cayman Islands, and 3% in Switzerland;\
    \ 4.9 trillion of 5.5 trillion USD of non-EU portfolio investments in debt securities\
    \ have a long-term (over one year) maturity; The EU27\u2032s portfolio investments\
    \ in extra-EU countries increased by more than 60% between 2009 and 2018, primarily\
    \ attributable to investments held in the \u2018North and Central America\u2019\
    \ and \u2018East Asia\u2019 regions; portfolio investments in US financial securities\
    \ increased from 2.1 trillion USD to 3.9 trillion USD, and in Japan from 280 billion\
    \ USD to 530 billion USD; the share of US securities in total portfolio investments\
    \ of the EU rose from 35 to 40%."

  15: Soy production in Argentina is reduced, with exports ceasing and soy crushing
    substantially decreasing. Prices for soy remain relatively stable in the US, China
    and EU, but prices for other importing nations rocket.
