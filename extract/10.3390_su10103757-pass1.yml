  14: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts, specifically temperature increases, influencing shifts
    in regional crop mixes in China.
  2: Changes in crop yields due to climate change (temperature, extreme events), weather
    shocks.
  4: Temperature during growing season, annual total precipitation, percent of cropland
    irrigated, per hectare use of pesticides and fertilizers, and time-averaged climate
    variables are considered possible risk drivers.

    squared), Precip (precipitation), Prep2 (precipitation squared), IrrigRate.lag
    (lagged irrigation rate), TimeTrend, Pesticide.lag (lagged pesticide use), Fertilizer.lag
    (lagged fertilizer use), FarmRev.lag (lagged farm revenue), PlantedScale.lag (lagged
    planted scale), meanGrs (mean growing season length), meanPrep (mean precipitation).
  10: Temperature and precipitation changes impact crop area shares.

    \ average"
  14: Increases in temperature; changes in precipitation; climate change
  15: Climate change, changes in water resources, irrigation capacity, rural transportation
    infrastructure, urban population, market access and demand
Highlights:
  1: Temperature increases are projected to increase the incidence of wheat and tubers,
    reduce rice and maize incidence, increase cash crops like vegetables and orchards,
    and decrease oil-bearing and specialty crops.
  2: Climate change negatively impacts corn and soybean yields in China, leading to
    economic losses. Farmers may alter cropland use decisions in response to expected
    yield changes and economic losses. There is limited research on climate impacts
    on China's crop mixes.
  7: Growing season length, precipitation, irrigation rate, time trend, pesticide
    use, fertilizer use, farm revenue, and planted scale all have statistically significant
    impacts on the share of land used for various crops.
  10: Rice and maize area shares show stronger responses to changes in temperature
    and precipitation.
  12: Warming will decrease the area shares of cereals including rice and maize, oil-bearing
    crops including soybeans and oilseed crops, and specialty crops. The area shares
    of food crops including wheat and tubers, fiber-producing crops including cotton
    and other fiber crops, and cash crops such as vegetables and orchards will increase.
  14: Climate impacts on crop mix can benefit both local and regional adaptation.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis uses a fractional multinomial logit (FMLOGIT) model to study the
    influence of climate on regional crop mixes, based on data from 2001 to 2013.
  2: "Analysis of climate impacts on crop yields, economic impacts of yield changes,\
    \ and factors influencing cropland allocation decisions. Explicit modeling of\
    \ the spatial differences in cropland allocations with a comprehensive geographic\
    \ coverage and projecting changes based on consistency of spatial units of input\u2013\
    output data."
  4: The study uses a set of independent variables influencing crop planting area
    shares, including environmental and economic factors. The analysis controls for
    potential endogeneity by using lagged values of revenue, pesticide and fertilizer
    use, irrigated acres, and planted area index.
  7: Regression analysis using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) with the crop-mix land
    use shares as dependent variables. Sample of 403 observations.
  12: "Projects changes in crop area shares under three alternative warming scenarios\
    \ relative to a baseline with climate change at the historical mean covering 2003\u2013\
    2012. The projections are region-specific."
  15: Literature review, analysis of results, projection of trade positions using
    crop mix information
More Notes:
  7: Coefficients can be interpreted as the change in land use share for a given crop
    resulting from a one-unit change in the driver variable. The use of lagged variables
    suggests an attempt to address endogeneity. The squared terms for growing season
    length and precipitation allow for non-linear effects.
  12: The projection does not take into account changes in other factors such as irrigation
    capacity, fertilizer use efficiency, and water resources.
  15: The study focuses on China and suggests that small changes in crop production
    there can significantly impact the world crop market.

  6: This page focuses on the impact of climate factors (temperature and precipitation)
    and non-climatic factors (planted area index, irrigated area share) on the area
    share of various crops in China. It does not provide information on macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal outcomes, nor does it analyze the costs and benefits of national-level
    adaptation. The focus is on agricultural impacts at a regional level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Economic losses in China's corn and soybeans sectors due to climate change, alterations
    in cropland use decisions by farmers.
  7: Crop-mix land use shares (Rice, Maize, Wheat, Soybeans, Tubers, Oilseeds, Cotton,
    Vegetables, Orchards, Specialties).
  12: No relevant information
  15: Agricultural production, rural transportation infrastructure, urbanization effects,
    trade positions, farmer income support policies, crop mix, changes in world crop
    market, integrated assessment modeling of the human-earth systems, nutrients cycle
    modeling, adaptation and/or mitigation activities on land and other natural resources

    \ that amounted to $820 million cumulatively (in Year 2009 $US dollars) during\
    \ the period of 2001\u20132009."

    (p < 0.1, p < 0.05, p < 0.01) for each driver variable's effect on crop-mix land
    use shares.
  12: "Under the SR1 +1.5\u25E6C scenario, the projected mean rice area share goes\
    \ down by 1.51 percentage points, and this decrease rises to 5.11 percentage points\
    \ under the SR3 +3.0\u25E6C scenario. Orchards, on the other hand, increase, with\
    \ the projected mean increasing by an average of 1.62 percentage points under\
    \ the SR1 +1.5\u25E6C scenario to 5.97 percentage points under the SR3 +3.0\u25E6\
    C scenario."
