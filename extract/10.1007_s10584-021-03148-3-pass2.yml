Drivers of Risk:
  3: Heat-related risks exacerbated by climate change (RCPs) and socio-economic scenarios
    (SSPs/EUSSPs), particularly for an ageing population in Finland.
  7: Mean summer temperatures are used as a hazard indicator, projected to increase
    under different RCP scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5).
  8: The impact and risk pattern of hot and extremely hot days on relative mortality.
  9: Socio-economic pathways (SSPs and EUSSPs) and their influence on indicators like
    education, income, employment and immigration.
  11: Temperature-based hazard, exposure, and social vulnerability indicators; socio-economic
    pathways (SSPs) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs).
  12: The drivers of risk include age, gender, income, education, immigration, and
    non-employment, as well as climate scenarios (RCPs) and socioeconomic pathways
    (SSPs).
Highlights:
  3: Projecting heat-related risks for Finland by combining all SSPs with three RCPs
    to investigate the influence of socio-economic scenarios on heat risk projections
    up to 2100.
  8: Heat-related vulnerability is projected to decrease by 2050 in all scenarios;
    however, SSP3 and SSP4 show increased regional variability.
  9: Vulnerability disparities vary significantly across socio-economic scenarios.
    SSP5 shows reduced disparities due to its high proportion of children and a reduction
    in low-income households, while SSP3 and SSP4 see increased inequalities due to
    stagnation in education levels. The SSP4 shows the lowest median vulnerability
    until 2040, then the greatest from 2070 onward. SSP5 shows the lowest vulnerability
    from 2050 onward but the highest in 2030.
  11: Dynamic vulnerability has a strong influence on heat-related risk. Until 2030,
    socio-economic scenarios induce a higher increase in heat risk than climate change
    alone. Between 2030 and 2050, this trend reverses, and socio-economic factors
    can partially or totally (in the case of RCP2.6) compensate for temperature increases.
    From 2070 onwards, SSP4 aggravates the risk, while SSP1, SSP2, and SSP5 imply
    a reduced risk.
  12: Urban-rural disparities in heat-related risks are more pronounced under dynamic
    vulnerability scenarios.  Differences in vulnerability projections between global
    SSPs and EUSSPs for 2050 were small. The north-south gradient of risk appeared
    to be sensitive to the scale of EUSSP projections.
Methodology:
  3: An indicator-based approach to project future vulnerability and risk at the postal
    code area scale, using global SSPs compared to EUSSPs. Projections of hazard,
    exposure, and vulnerability based on scenario data.
  7: Vulnerability is assessed by combining education, immigration, and economic status
    projections at the postal code level, normalized using a z-score method. Weak
    economic status is projected using a regression analysis based on GDP/capita and
    the proportion of low-income households. Hazard is assessed using mean temperature
    from climate model projections, based on the minimum mortality temperature (MMT)
    threshold.
  8: Temperature-mortality relationship from Helsinki used for the whole country,
    thresholds weighted by relative mortality increase over two decades.
  9: Vulnerability is projected using different SSPs and EUSSPs, with comparisons
    made across postal code areas, NUTS2 regions, and nationally. Analysis of vulnerability
    index values.
  11: Uses 13 CMIP5 GCMs to project hazard and combines this with exposure and social
    vulnerability indicators under different RCPs and SSPs. The analysis considers
    both constant (2010 baseline) and dynamic vulnerability.
  12: The analysis uses RCPs and SSPs to project heat-related risks in Finland in
    2050 and 2100, comparing constant vulnerability projections with dynamic ones.  The
    analysis compares EUSSP projections based on national vs sub-national (NUTS2)
    scale.
More Notes:
  3: The study focuses on Finland as a case study due to existing heat-related mortality
    and morbidity, and an ageing population.
  7: The study uses Finnish data at NUTS2 and NUTS3 scales, as well as postal code
    data. The analysis relies on SSP projections for socio-economic factors and RCP
    scenarios for climate change projections.
  8: Data is based on projections using RCPs at a 10x10 km scale from 2010 to 2100,
    with population density used as an exposure indicator.
  9: The paper focuses on vulnerability at a sub-national level (postal code areas,
    NUTS2 regions), and its socio-economic drivers, but does not directly quantify
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, nor adaptation costs and benefits. The vulnerability
    index is used as a proxy for risk.
  11: RCP8.5 is considered compatible only with SSP5. The combinations RCP2.6*SSP3
    and RCP2.6*SSP5 are considered implausible.
  12: The page focuses on heat-related risks in Finland and the importance of considering
    dynamic vulnerability in risk projections. The comparison of projections for a
    single time point (2050) may not capture the trends that evolve strongly throughout
    the twenty-first century.
