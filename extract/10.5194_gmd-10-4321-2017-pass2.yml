Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Impacts of 1.5\xB0C global warming"
  3: Projected changes in weather and climate, individual weather events.
  15: Climate change (implied), Population changes, Land Use (LU) patterns, Other
    external drivers (dams, irrigation, fertilizer, nitrogen deposition, fishing intensities,
    forest management)
  20: Climate change (temperature-related mortality), human influences on climate-sensitive
    impacts including nitrogen deposition, fertilizer input, irrigation, water abstraction,
    dams and reservoirs, forest management, mortality baselines, population and GDP
    data, coastal protection, and fishing catch data.
  23: Climate change.
Highlights:
  1: "Assessing the impacts of 1.5\xB0C global warming"
  3: "The paper describes the ISIMIP response to the IPCC's invitation to provide\
    \ a special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5\xB0C. It aims to provide\
    \ a scientific basis for an aggregation of impacts across sectors and analysis\
    \ of cross-sectoral interactions."
  15: "Provides consistent gridded (0.5\xB0 x 0.5\xB0) GDP data for the period 1860-2100."
  20: Explicit representation of socio-economic drivers on impact indicators is an
    important step forward compared to previous simulations.
  23: Climate change has the potential to cause severe economic losses in the value
    of European forest land.
Methodology:
  1: Simulation protocol of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project
    (ISIMIP2b)
  3: "Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) is used to provide\
    \ tailored, cross-sectorally consistent impact projections. The simulation protocol\
    \ allows for separation of historical warming impacts, quantification of the impacts\
    \ of additional warming up to 1.5\xB0C, and assessment of climate effects based\
    \ on climate scenarios."
  15: Historical national GDP data (1860-2010) are derived by extrapolating national
    income (GDP per capita) and GDP time series between 1960-2009 from Penn World
    Tables 8.1 with per capita growth rates from the Maddison project. Missing data
    is filled using Penn World Tables 9.0 and World Development Indicators. Future
    projections are taken from the SSP database (Dellink et al., 2015).
  20: The study compares a simulation with pre-industrial climate and human influences
    to a simulation with climate change and human influences to disentangle the effect
    of climate change, controlling for other drivers.

More Notes:
  1: The paper describes the simulation protocol for ISIMIP2b, which likely involves
    multiple sectors and models to assess climate change impacts. This protocol is
    relevant for my broader analysis because the ISIMIP project likely generates data
    and insights into the macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks of climate change and
    the costs and benefits of adaptation, even if not directly stated on this page.
  3: The study acknowledges the complex translation of climate change into societal
    impacts, and the limitations of current models. It also states that traditionally
    sector-specific impact models are constructed independently and do not interact.
  15: Gridded GDP data are downscaled from national GDP data using gridded population
    data from HYDE3.2 for the historical period and SSP2 gridded population projections
    for the future period.
  20: The paper acknowledges that the effects of human activity on the climate and
    climate-sensitive impacts are intrinsically linked and cannot be separated precisely.

    provide quantitative information on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, economic
    costs/benefits of adaptation, or related methodological details.
