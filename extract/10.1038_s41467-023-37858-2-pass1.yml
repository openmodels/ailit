Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea-level rise and storm scenarios are impacting the outcomes of coastal flooding.
  2: Reef degradation and sea-level rise are identified as key drivers impacting coastal
    flooding potential.
  3: Thermal stress events, stony coral tissue-loss disease (SCTLD), and climate-related
    mortality are identified as risks.
  4: Sea-level rise, increased wave energy due to greater water depths, storm surge,
    erosion.
  7: Increased frequency of severe storms and sea-level rise due to climate change.
  8: Sea-level rise and coastal flooding due to extreme weather events are identified
    as drivers of risk impacting coastal communities.
  9: Reef degradation impacts future bathymetry; bioerosion and sediment incorporation
    also affect reef-accretion potential.
  13: Coral reef degradation is a risk.
Evaluation overview:
  1: The ability of coral reefs to protect coastlines from storm-driven flooding is
    being evaluated in terms of their capacity to keep pace with sea-level rise.
  2: The study evaluates the impacts of reef degradation on coastal flooding at Buck
    Island Reef National Monument.
  3: This paper evaluates the potential impacts of restoring reef-building corals,
    specifically Acropora palmata and Pseudodiploria strigosa, on reef accretion potential.
  4: The study evaluates the ability of reef-crest habitats at Buck Island Reef National
    Monument (BIRNM) to keep pace with future sea-level rise and the impact of coral
    restoration on coastal protection during storms.
  6: The paper evaluates the impact of reef degradation on coastal protection, specifically
    looking at reef accretion potential and its role in mitigating coastal flooding.
  7: The study evaluates the potential of reef restoration to mitigate sea-level rise
    and coastal flooding.
  8: The paper provides an overview of the potential impacts of coral reef restoration
    on mitigating climate-change impacts such as sea-level rise and coastal flooding.
  9: The paper evaluates reef-accretion potential at different sites, focusing on
    factors affecting future total water levels due to reef degradation at BIRNM.
  13: The paper rigorously values the role of U.S. coral reefs in coastal hazard risk
    reduction.
Highlights:
  1: Successful restoration of Acropora palmata could mitigate the most extreme impacts
    of coastal flooding by reversing reef erosion and allowing reefs to keep pace
    with sea-level rise.
  2: Reef erosion results in a measurable increase in flooding potential by the end
    of the century; coral restoration efforts could mitigate impacts of sea-level
    rise.
  3: "A single, large-scale A. palmata outplanting effort before 2030 could result\
    \ in increases in coral cover on the reef crest at BIRNM for the next 20 years.\
    \ Under the most optimistic scenario, a sustained increase of 30% A. palmata cover\
    \ could increase reef-accretion potential on the BIRNM reef crest to 7.38 mm y-1\
    \ (\xB10.60) on average. This could allow the reef crest to keep pace with Low\
    \ to Intermediate-Low predictions of sea-level rise for the mid- and end-of-century."
  4: Coral restoration can improve the ability of reefs to keep pace with sea-level
    rise and reduce coastal flooding during storms.
  6: The southern reef crest at BIRNM was maintaining its role as a coastal barrier
    in 2016. However, its future is precarious given coral loss. Restoration of A.
    palmata colonies can help mitigate some impacts of future sea-level rise. The
    impacts of sea-level rise will be amplified by the diverging patterns of geomorphic
    change.
  7: Successful restoration could increase reef accretion rates and reduce predicted
    flood levels, potentially protecting vulnerable communities.
  8: Restoration efforts have the potential to combat the worst projected impacts
    of sea-level rise and coastal flooding by maintaining carbonate production and
    reef accretion.
  9: The assessment of the potential restoration impacts for A. palmata on coastal
    hazard protection indicates the possibility of maintaining reef-crest habitats
    against sea-level rise.
  13: U.S. coral reefs play a role in coastal hazard risk reduction.
Methodology:
  1: Combines coral-growth measurements and carbonate-budget assessments with hydrodynamic
    modeling to quantify future coastal flooding under various coral-restoration scenarios.
  2: Analysis performed using carbonate-budget models and hydrodynamic modeling to
    assess reef accretion and coastal flooding potential by 2100.
  3: The study uses coral-growth experiments conducted at Buck Island Reef National
    Monument (BIRNM) from 2019 to 2021. A population model was developed to project
    potential changes in A. palmata cover under various restoration and mortality
    scenarios. Carbonate-budget models were used to assess reef-accretion potential.
  4: Carbonate-budget models were used to project reef-elevation change and reef-accretion
    potential under different restoration scenarios. Wave modeling was used to assess
    total water levels under different sea-level rise and storm scenarios. The study
    focuses on BIRNM reef-crest habitats and results are applicable to this region
    and potentially similar reef environments.
  6: The study uses modeling to project total water levels under various sea-level
    rise, storm, and coral restoration scenarios, applicable until 2100. It also references
    surveys done in 2016.
  7: Model estimates of reef-accretion potential and sea-level rise scenarios, with
    limitations in considering the full complexity of reef ecology.
  8: The analysis is based on the ReefBudget methodology, involving the calculation
    of carbonate budgets from reef-census data across multiple sites.
  9: ReefBudget v1 methodology is used with linear mixed-effects models to analyze
    spatial variability; used for hydrodynamic modeling based on bathymetries estimated
    under different scenarios.
  13: The study involves field data collection, carbonate budget model generation,
    and numerical modeling of wave dynamics over a fringing coral reef.
More Notes:

    alongside climate-change mitigation.
  2: Buck Island is a site of cultural and ecological importance affected by reef
    degradation.
  3: The study highlights the potential for coral restoration to enhance reef accretion
    but emphasizes the need for additional local management, global reduction of carbon
    emissions, and/or the recovery of ecological processes to maintain stable coral
    populations in the long term.
  8: The paper argues that restoration can be a vital component of solutions to support
    coral reefs as coastal barriers into the future.

    Survey. The work was performed under scientific collection permit BUIS-2019-SCI-0004.
Quantitative material:
  1: Projects a sea-level rise of ~0.5 m expected by 2100 with moderate carbon-emissions
    reductions.
  2: "Reef-accretion potential varied between -5.31 mm y\u22121 and 6.21 mm y\u2212\
    1, averaging -1.56 mm y\u22121 across 54 sites."
  3: "Calcification rates of A. palmata ranged from 21.04 to 42.91 kg m-2 y-1, with\
    \ an average of 29.07 kg m-2 y-1 (\xB11.26). The average rate of change in the\
    \ height of A. palmata colonies was 6.99 cm y-1 (\xB11.56). Calcification rates\
    \ of Ps. strigosa colonies ranged from 7.96 to 21.31 kg m-2 y-1, with an average\
    \ of 14.30 kg m-2 y-1 (\xB10.86). The average annual change in height of Ps. strigosa\
    \ was 0.95 cm y-1 (\xB10.71). Model results project increases in A. palmata cover\
    \ by 8.5%, 21.2%, and 42.4% under fixed-mortality restoration scenarios."
  4: "A 30% increase in Acropora palmata cover could allow the reef to keep pace with\
    \ Low to Intermediate-Low projections of relative sea-level rise. Maximum total\
    \ water levels averaged 4.17 m (\xB10.03) under the 10-year storm scenario and\
    \ 4.94 m (\xB10.02) under the 50-year storm scenario. Restoration could reduce\
    \ total water levels during future storms by up to 0.81 m (\xB10.03) under intermediate-to-high\
    \ sea-level rise scenarios."
  7: A >10% reduction (0.81 m) in total water levels during storms, reduction of flooding
    from major hurricanes to levels projected for minor storms, and a projection of
    0.2 m net erosion by the end of the century.
  8: The paper estimates a projected ~0.2 m increase in wave-driven water levels during
    storms under certain scenarios.
  9: "Potential changes in carbonate production rates for A. palmata, increasing from\
    \ 36.24 kg m\u22122 y\u22121 to 48.24 kg m\u22122 y\u22121; potential outplanting\
    \ of 100,000 to 500,000 coral colonies."

    reef carbonate budgets on alongshore variations in wave-driven total water levels
    on Buck Island Reef National Monument.
