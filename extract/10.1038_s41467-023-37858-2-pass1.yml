Drivers of Risk:
  2: Sea-level rise, reef degradation (bioerosion), changes in reef-accretion capacity,
    storms
  3: Climate-related mortality of coral (thermal stress events, stony coral tissue-loss
    disease); Sea-level rise.
  6: Climate change leading to coral loss, episodic natural events like hurricanes
    (Hurricane Maria), and disease outbreaks (SCTLD) are driving the risk to coastal
    protection provided by coral reefs.
  8: The primary drivers of risk are sea-level rise, increasing frequency of severe
    thermal-stress events and storms, ocean acidification, and erosion.
Highlights:
  2: Reef erosion will result in a small, but measurable, increase in flooding potential
    by the end of the century. Reef-accretion potential was higher in the southern
    sector than in the northern sector. Bioerosion was the dominant process at 91%
    of sites.
  3: Restoration with sufficient A. palmata cover (at least 25% increase) is estimated
    to be sufficient for the reef to keep pace with even the most conservative projections
    of sea-level rise.
  6: Coral restoration, specifically of A. palmata, can help mitigate the impacts
    of sea-level rise by reducing total water levels by up to 0.81 m, but maintaining
    its functional impacts will likely require increased coral resilience and/or adaptation.
  8: "The study suggests that reef restoration can mitigate the impacts of sea-level\
    \ rise and coastal flooding, while unchecked erosion could counteract progress\
    \ from emissions reductions. Restoration can revive reef accretion and maintain\
    \ reefs\u2019 capacity for coastal protection."
Methodology:
  2: Census-based carbonate-budget models, hydrodynamic modeling, analysis of spatial
    variability in reef-accretion potential, real-world case study using data from
    Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), linear mixed-effects model
  3: Simple population model (assuming no reproduction) based on average planar growth
    rates of A. palmata and literature-derived mortality and fragmentation rates to
    project potential changes in A. palmata cover on the BIRNM reef crest under various
    restoration and mortality scenarios.  Carbonate-budget models are used to estimate
    reef accretion potential.
  6: The analysis uses modeling to project reef accretion and coastal flooding under
    different sea-level rise, storm, and coral restoration scenarios, examining the
    impact of reef degradation and restoration on total water levels.
  8: The study calculates carbonate budgets at 54 stratified-random sites, analyzing
    reef-census data using a modification of Hubbard et al. and the ReefBudget v1
    methodology. Bioerosion rates are estimated based on parrotfish, sea urchin, and
    endolithic/microbioeroder surveys. Net carbonate production and reef-accretion
    potential are then calculated. The results are applicable to the reefs of Bonaire
    Island National Marine Park (BIRNM).
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on the impacts of reef degradation and restoration on coastal
    flooding at Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), off the coast of St. Croix,
    U.S. Virgin Islands. It assesses the impact of reef erosion on coastal flooding
    by 2100.
  3: The study uses Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM) as a case study.
  6: The study acknowledges that carbonate budget models don't explicitly consider
    physical erosion from storms, and that recent coral population declines suggest
    their estimates of present-day reef accretion potential are overly optimistic.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Coastal flooding potential, shoreline erosion, reef accretion, beach habitat,
    tourism industry support
  3: No relevant information
  6: This paper focuses on coastal protection as an outcome of coral reef health,
    which can be linked to the economic benefits of reduced flooding and erosion damage,
    which in turn can be linked to fiscal outcomes.
  8: This study focuses on coastal flooding and erosion due to extreme weather events
    and sea-level rise, which have significant impacts on coastal communities, but
    does not directly quantify macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national
    level. It discusses the costs and benefits of reef restoration as a form of coastal
    protection but does not relate these to GDP, fiscal balance, etc.
Quantitative material:
  2: "Reef-accretion potential averaged -1.56 mm y\u22121 (\xB10.27 standard error\
    \ [SE]) across sites. Southern reef crest reef-accretion potential: 0.10 mm y\u2212\
    1 \xB1 1.20 SE. Estimated decrease in elevation due to reef erosion averaging\
    \ -13.09 (\xB10.02) cm by 2100."
  3: "Restoration could increase reef-accretion potential on the BIRNM reef crest\
    \ to 7.38 mm y\u22121 (\xB10.60) on average."
  6: "A. palmata colonies could grow as fast as sea-level rise even under the most\
    \ pessimistic scenarios predicted by 2100 (i.e., up to 13.4 mm y\u22121 in St.\
    \ Croix); individual outplanted A. palmata colonies could grow ~70 mm y\u2212\
    1 at BIRNM; southern reef crest is projected to more-or-less maintain its present-day\
    \ elevation while most other areas are projected to lose 0.12-0.23 m of elevation\
    \ by 2100."
  8: "The paper mentions that even the relatively low rates of maximum erosion (0.45\
    \ m by 2100) could almost double the realized water levels over the reef crest.\
    \ Also discusses projected wave-driven water level increase of ~0.2 m during storms.\
    \ Reef restoration could keep water depths near the lowest predictions of sea-level\
    \ rise (~0.30 m by 2100). Carbonate production and bioerosion rates are quantified\
    \ in kg CaCO3 m\u22122 y\u22121."
