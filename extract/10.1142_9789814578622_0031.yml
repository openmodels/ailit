Drivers of Risk:
  4: River salinity, with spatial variation in maximum salinity during 2011-2012.
  6: No relevant information
  10: Climate-induced changes in sea level, temperature, rainfall, and altered riverine
    flows from the Himalayas.
  11: Temperature increase by 2050 under scenarios A2, A1b, and B1 using IPS-CM4L,
    MIROC 3.2 and ECHO-G climate models; Rainfall change by 2050 under scenarios A2,
    A1b, and B1 using IPS-CM4L, MIROC 3.2 and ECHO-G climate models; Relative Mean
    Sea Level Rise (RMSLR) by 2050
  12: Changing climate (temperature and rainfall), Projections of water abstraction
  17: Climate change, specifically sea-level rise (implied by '35 cm RMSLR') and local
    subsidence (2mm/year), under the B1 emission scenario.
  19: Decrease in freshwater river areas and increased river salinity.
  20: Future climate change scenarios (best and worst case)
  25: Salinity changes due to climate change.
Highlights:
  4: Identifies areas in southwestern Bangladesh (Satkhira, Khulna, Bagerhat) with
    varying salinity levels, potentially affecting agriculture and water resources.
  6: No relevant information
  10: Salinization of river water and saltwater intrusion are expected to worsen in
    coastal areas due to climate change.
  11: Projected temperature increases, rainfall changes, and sea level rise by 2050
    under different emission scenarios
  12: No relevant information
  17: Salinity intrusion is projected to significantly impact coastal areas of Bangladesh
    by 2050, with varying levels of severity across different districts.
  19: Significant decrease in freshwater availability with implications for agriculture.
  20: Significant losses of freshwater zones are expected in several districts of
    Bangladesh under future climate change scenarios, with some districts potentially
    losing all freshwater zones even in the best-case scenario.
Methodology:
  4: Spatial mapping of maximum river salinity.
  6: River water salinity is modeled using MIKE 21FM and MIKE 11 modules. A Bay of
    Bengal model simulates salinity based on water flow estimates, measured upstream
    salinity, time-series water level data, and downstream salinity. A separate salinity
    model is coupled with a hydrodynamic module to assess river salinity in the southwest
    coastal zone using measured upstream salinity concentrations and Bay of Bengal
    salinity estimates for the downstream boundary.
  10: No relevant information
  11: Climate change modeling using historical salinity data from December 2011 to
    May 2012 as a baseline and projecting to 2050 under different emission scenarios
    using specific climate models (IPS-CM4L, MIROC 3.2, ECHO-G)
  12: Rainfall-Runoff model estimated runoffs for IPCC A2, A1b, and B1 emission scenarios
    with three GCMs for 2050. MIKE 11 model used runoff estimates, water abstraction
    projections, observed river flows, and dry season water flow proxies to estimate
    water flow and flow velocity along 230 river branches in the southwest region.
  17: Climate change scenario modeling to project salinity intrusion, considering
    sea-level rise and local subsidence. The analysis is applicable to the coastal
    zone of Bangladesh in the year 2050, under the B1 emission scenario.
  19: No relevant information
  25: The analysis is limited by several assumptions, including the Ganges Water Treaty
    holding, no polder/embankment breaches, and focusing only on salinity exposure
    without adaptive capacity.
More Notes:
  4: The data is from IWM, 2013 and represents salinity levels in 2011-2012. It's
    implicitly related to climate change impacts, although that is not explicitly
    stated.
  6: The assumption that all 61 polders are functioning well and will not be overtopped
    by 2050 may influence the accuracy of the salinity modeling results.
  10: The black images provide no additional information.
  11: The baseline salinity data is from IWM. The temperature and rainfall changes
    and sea level rise are given for three emission scenarios (A2, A1b, and B1) and
    are specific to certain climate models (IPS-CM4L, MIROC 3.2, ECHO-G)
  12: The models focus on estimating water flow and velocity in the southwest region,
    not on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes or costs/benefits of adaptation.
  17: The B1 emission scenario represents a specific future climate pathway. The map
    visualization provides a spatial understanding of the projected salinity changes.
  19: The page highlights the expected impacts on freshwater ecosystems but lacks
    direct links to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. The images provided are not
    useful for analysis.
  20: The information is specific to districts within Bangladesh. The term "freshwater
    zones" may need further definition to understand its macroeconomic relevance.
    The analysis does not directly link freshwater loss to macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes.
  25: The lack of assessment of soil salinity changes, trans-boundary river water
    flows (Brahmaputra), and consideration of adaptive capacity are significant limitations.
