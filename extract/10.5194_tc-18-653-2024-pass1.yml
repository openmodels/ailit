Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sub-shelf melting, ice discharge, surface mass balance (snowfall, runoff), ocean
    temperature, atmospheric temperature.
  2: Increased glacier flow due to warm and salty circumpolar deep water (CDW) causing
    sub-shelf melt, increased surface runoff due to rising atmospheric temperatures,
    and potential hydrofracturing of ice shelves due to increased rainfall and surface
    melt.
  3: Uncertainties in SMB (surface mass balance) and ocean-induced melt processes
    are key drivers. Future Antarctic SMB is computed based on GCM outputs.
  4: Changes in oceanic and atmospheric boundary conditions derived from CMIP5 (NorESM1-M)
    and CMIP6 (MRI-ESM2-0, IPSL-CM6A-LR, CESM2-WACCM, UKESM1-0-LL) climate models
    are used as forcing, specifically monthly-averaged air temperature and sublimation
    anomalies as well as precipitation ratios for atmospheric forcing, and yearly-averaged
    temperature and salinity anomalies for oceanic forcing.
  6: Shocks impacting outcomes include atmospheric and oceanic forcings and melt-elevation
    feedback.
  7: Changes in atmospheric present-day climatology, oceanic present-day climatology,
    CMIP6 GCM climate forcing, atmospheric lapse rate, degree day factors, and sub-shelf
    melt parameterisation.
  8: Sub-shelf melting
  10: Retreat of Thwaites Glacier, warming, and emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5)
  11: Projections are impacted by constant present-day conditions and shared socio-economic
    pathways SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5.
  12: SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 climate scenarios drive changes in surface mass balance
    (SMB), sub-shelf melt, and calving.
  13: Sub-shelf melt, snow accumulation, warmer air temperatures, surface runoff,
    calving fluxes, oceanic and atmospheric drivers
  14: Oceanic and atmospheric forcings and ice-shelf hydrofracturing impacting the
    Antarctic ice sheet.
  15: Oceanic and atmospheric forcing, melt-elevation feedback
  16: Oceanic forcing (changes in ocean temperature and circulation) and atmospheric
    forcing (changes in snow accumulation and surface runoff).
  17: Oceanic forcing triggers deep inland penetration of the grounding line within
    the marine basins; atmospheric forcing causes retreat close to the ice sheet margins,
    driven by the melt-elevation feedback; weakening of ice shelves by hydrofracturing.
  18: "Antarctic near-surface warming (90-60\xB0S), total surface mass balance, snow\
    \ accumulation, surface meltwater production, surface runoff, and rainfall"
  19: Antarctic surface mass balance (SMB) is impacted by rising air temperatures,
    specifically increases in surface melt and rainfall, leading to increased surface
    runoff. Near-surface warming drives changes in SMB over both grounded ice sheets
    and ice shelves.
  20: Ocean-driven retreat of Thwaites Glacier and long-term warming, especially affecting
    West Antarctica.
  22: Atmospheric warming, input of freshwater from ice shelves, surface runoff, melt-elevation
    feedback, melt-albedo feedback
  23: Very high emission pathway (SSP5-8.5)
  24: Changes in ice-sheet elevation and area, particularly over the grounded ice
    sheet and ice shelves, influence the outcome.
  25: Oceanic forcing, atmospheric warming, melt-elevation feedback, near-surface
    warming, increase in surface runoff, snow accumulation.
  26: Sub-shelf melting, calving at the ice front, near-surface air temperature, precipitation,
    geothermal heat flux, ocean temperature and salinity on the continental shelf,
    divergence of ice velocity, accumulated strain, the ice thickness, and (if desired)
    surface liquid water availability are all drivers of ice sheet dynamics.
  28: Air temperature and precipitation influence snow accumulation and melt.
  30: Thermal forcing (TF), defined as T - Tf, at the ice-ocean interface drives sub-shelf
    melting.

Highlights:
  1: Ocean is the primary driver of short-term Antarctic mass loss. Atmosphere initially
    plays a mitigating role through increased snowfall. Under the very high-emission
    pathway, the influence of the atmosphere shifts beyond the end of the century,
    becoming an amplifying driver of mass loss. Under a very high-emission scenario,
    oceanic and atmospheric drivers are projected to result in a complete collapse
    of the West Antarctic ice sheet. Mass loss is likely to remain confined to the
    Amundsen Sea Embayment under a more sustainable socio-economic pathway.
  2: The future evolution of the AIS is uncertain, with models showing possibilities
    of both mass loss and gain depending on emission scenarios and the representation
    of processes like hydrofracturing.
  3: "The study quantifies how uncertainties in ice\u2013ocean and ice\u2013atmosphere\
    \ interactions translate into uncertainties in the projected behavior of the AIS."
  4: No relevant information
  8: The calibrated ensemble reproduces historical trends in ice-sheet mass change
    and its drivers, and reduces uncertainty in model hindcasts compared to the prior
    distribution. Rapid grounded-ice mass losses are reproduced around the margins
    of the ice sheet, especially in the Amundsen Sea Sector and the Aurora Basin in
    East Antarctica.
  10: Antarctic mass loss will contribute positively to GMSLR, especially after 2040.
    Under SSP5-8.5, a collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) is expected
    between 2300 and 2500. Early-millennium warming under SSP5-8.5 may commit the
    East Antarctic ice sheet to grounding-line retreat. Trajectories of GMSLR diverge
    significantly between SSP5-8.5 and SSP1-2.6 over the following centuries.
  11: Key outcomes show the probability of being ungrounded under different climate
    scenarios and their contribution rates to sea level rise.
  12: The paper presents projected changes in SMB, sub-shelf melt, and calving for
    both West and East Antarctic ice sheets under different climate scenarios.
  13: 'Under SSP5-8.5: Until end of century, ice loss primarily driven by ocean warming
    and sub-shelf melting; After the end of the century, net mass balance further
    decreases due to a decrease in SMB; During the 23rd century, sub-shelf melt fluxes
    significantly decrease as ice shelves collapse, and Antarctic mass loss becomes
    dominated by the surface mass balance; Under SSP1-2.6: Mass loss may be characterised
    by the first phase only.'
  14: Graph shows Antarctic contributions to global mean sea-level rise under the
    SSP5-8.5 scenario, showing fluctuations and trends in different Antarctic regions.
  15: Contribution of atmospheric and oceanic forcings to projected Antarctic mass
    changes; mean ice thickness change under different forcing scenarios
  16: Oceanic forcing is the primary driver of Antarctic mass loss during the 21st
    century. Atmospheric forcing mitigates ocean-driven Antarctic mass loss and sea-level
    rise during the 21st century under a very high-emission scenario. Beyond the 21st
    century, atmospheric forcing becomes a more significant driver of sea-level rise.
    Both atmospheric and oceanic forcings, when considered separately, are sufficient
    to trigger a complete collapse of the WAIS by the end of the millennium.
  17: Projected Antarctic mass loss under SSP5-8.5 is mainly driven by the combined
    effects of oceanic forcing and the melt-elevation feedback; the atmosphere initially
    mitigates ocean-induced ice loss through enhanced snowfall, but transitions into
    an amplifying driver of mass loss by the end of the century; hydrofracturing produces
    higher median rates of contribution to GMSLR, especially as of the end of the
    century; acceleration of grounding-line retreat in West Antarctica and the marine
    basins of the EAIS is mainly explained by an acceleration of ice-shelf breakup.
  18: Projections of Antarctic surface mass balance components (total surface mass
    balance, snow accumulation, surface meltwater production, surface runoff, and
    rainfall) over the grounded ice sheet and ice shelves are provided under different
    warming scenarios (SSP 5-8.5) out to 2300, and sensitivity of future Antarctic
    surface mass balance to Antarctic near-surface warming is shown.
  19: The mitigating potential of Antarctic surface mass balance (SMB) on sea-level
    rise decreases over time. The increase in surface runoff will offset snow accumulation,
    eventually reducing SMB's effectiveness. Specific warming thresholds are identified
    where SMB changes significantly.
  20: Emission scenarios have limited influence on Antarctic ice loss by the end of
    the century; projections show significant potential sea-level rise by 2300.
  22: Freshwater input from ice shelves can create a positive feedback loop leading
    to ocean warming and increased melt rates. PDD-based projections of surface runoff
    demonstrate good agreement with climate models in terms of pattern and magnitudes.
  23: Provides projections of surface runoff rates under a very high emission pathway,
    comparing a Bayesian calibrated ensemble with results from climate models.
  24: Credible projections of future Antarctic mass balance were produced by considering
    existing uncertainties and conditioning ensemble projections on relevant observations.
  25: The ocean will be the primary driver of short-term mass loss in the West Antarctic
    ice sheet in the 21st century. Under a very high-emission scenario, both the ocean
    and the atmosphere have the potential to lead to a complete collapse of West Antarctica
    by the end of the millennium. Mass loss will likely transition from ocean-driven
    to atmospheric-driven, dictated by future atmospheric warming.

Methodology:
  1: Observationally-calibrated ice-sheet model forced by a panel of CMIP6 climate
    models. Simulations project outcomes to 2100, 2300, and 3000.
  2: This page discusses modeling approaches to predict future ice sheet evolution,
    and it references different models that predict AIS mass loss vs. mass gain.
  3: "Uses the ice-sheet model Kori-ULB, running an ensemble of simulations that accounts\
    \ for key uncertainties in both ice\u2013ocean and ice\u2013atmosphere interactions.\
    \ A Bayesian calibration of the model simulations is performed by comparing the\
    \ results with estimates of regional net mass balance from IMBIE. The calibrated\
    \ projections extend to the end of the millennium. All simulations are performed\
    \ at a spatial resolution of 16 km."
  4: Ice-sheet simulations begin in 1950. Hindcasts (1950-2014) use CMIP5 model NorESM1-M.
    Projections (2015-2300) use a subset of CMIP6 models. After 2300, climate is kept
    constant. SSP 5-8.5 and 1-2.6 scenarios are used. Climate forcing is implemented
    via anomalies relative to a 1995-2014 baseline, added to reference fields in the
    ice-sheet model.
  6: The analysis uses Bayesian methods, applying a multivariate Gaussian likelihood
    function to compare model predictions with historical mass balance observations,
    utilizing data prior to 2015 and considering discrepancies in observation and
    model errors.
  7: The study uses uncertainty analysis with different parameters governing ice-ocean
    and ice-atmosphere interactions to model ice sheet melt. They vary atmospheric
    and oceanic climatology, CMIP6 GCM climate forcing, atmospheric lapse rate, thickness
    of the thermally-active layer, degree day factors for ice and snow melt, and sub-shelf
    melt parameterizations. Latin hypercube sampling is used to sample parameters.
  8: Bayesian calibration of an ensemble model using observational constraints from
    the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE).
  10: Calibrated ensemble (posterior distributions) is used to project Antarctic ice
    loss and its contribution to GMSLR throughout the millennium, focusing on two
    emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5).
  11: Analysis uses a Bayesian calibrated ensemble with 100 simulations per SSP scenario
    to estimate probabilities of the ice sheet being ungrounded.
  12: Calibrated probabilistic projections are used, with a 5-year running average
    applied. Analysis considers changes in volume above flotation.
  13: Calibrated projections for SSP5-8.5 isolating different components of climate
    forcing, using 100-member ensembles of projections.
  14: Uses a 100-member ensemble to separate the impacts of oceanic and atmospheric
    forcings, and melt-elevation feedback.
  15: 100-member ensemble under SSP 5-8.5 and other scenarios; Bayesian calibrated
    mean; millennium-long projections
  16: Sensitivity analyses were performed by including the atmospheric forcing only,
    the oceanic forcing only, both forcings, and both forcings neglecting the melt-elevation
    feedback. The atmospheric forcing is kept constant to the present-day climatology
    as of the year 2015 when the oceanic forcing only is included.
  17: Calibrated ensemble under atmospheric forcing alone projects a significantly
    lower median sea-level contribution by the end of the millennium; the influence
    of the weakening of ice shelves by hydrofracturing is approximated following Pollard
    et al., 2015; DeConto and Pollard, 2016; analysis focuses specifically on hydrofracturing
    and does not include the marine ice cliff instability (MICI) mechanisms.
  18: Calibrated probabilistic projections of Antarctic surface mass balance components
    under SSP 5-8.5 until 2300 with 5-year running average applied. Bayesian calibrated
    median surface mass balance, snow accumulation and surface runoff projected over
    2015-2300 are compared with the mean annual near-surface temperature anomaly projected
    by four GCMs from CMIP6 under SSP 1-2.6 and 5-8.5.
  19: "The relationship between ensemble median SMB, snow accumulation, surface runoff\
    \ and regional (90-60\xB0S) annual near-surface warming imposed by GCMs is examined.\
    \ Analysis is performed for both grounded ice sheets and ice shelves. Results\
    \ are applicable to projections of future Antarctic SMB under warming climates,\
    \ up to 2300."
  20: The study uses observationally-calibrated projections accounting for key uncertainties
    related to ice-climate interactions.
  22: Uses GCMs (specifically SSP5-8.5 and SSP1-2.6 scenarios), examines the relationship
    between median SMB estimates and regional atmospheric warming; compares PDD-based
    melt-and-runoff scheme projections with regional (MAR) and general (CESM2-WACCM)
    climate models under an SSP5-8.5 scenario; Results are applicable to multi-century
    timescales, but GCM projections are currently limited to SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5
    beyond 2100.
  23: Bayesian calibrated ensemble, MAR model forced by CESM2 and CNRM-CM6, CESM2-WACCM
    model; 5-year running average applied.
  24: The study uses an ice-sheet model conditioned on observations and explores uncertainties
    in model parameters, particularly ice-ocean-atmosphere interactions. It applies
    multiple climate forcings for each emission scenario to drive the ice-sheet model.
    Bayesian calibration is used, aggregated over three main Antarctic regions.
  25: "Observationally-calibrated projections of the Antarctic ice sheet until the\
    \ end of the millennium based on an ensemble of simulations accounting for nine\
    \ key uncertainties in ice\u2013ocean\u2013atmosphere interactions. Calibration\
    \ in a Bayesian framework is noted as less common."
  26: The paper describes the Kori-ULB ice-sheet model, a thermomechanical hybrid
    model using shallow-ice and shallow-shelf approximations for grounded and floating
    ice, respectively. Grounding line migration is accounted for with a flux condition.
    Basal sliding is modeled with a Weertman sliding law. Sub-shelf melting is parameterized.
    Calving is determined by crevasse depth relative to ice thickness.
  27: The PDD-based melt-and-runoff model uses monthly temperatures and precipitation
    to simulate surface mass balance using a weekly time step, achieving equilibrium
    over several years.
  28: The paper describes a positive degree day (PDD) scheme used to calculate snow
    and ice melt at weekly timesteps, accounting for diurnal cycles and synoptic variability
    using a normal distribution. Accumulation is determined by precipitation and near-surface
    temperature. Refreezing of meltwater and runoff of excess meltwater are also calculated.
    SMB anomalies are used to maintain steady-state.
  29: "Describes two basal melt rate parameterizations for ice shelves: PICO and a\
    \ plume model. The PICO model uses a heat exchange velocity (\u03B3 \u22C6T) within\
    \ a specified range. The plume model is a two-dimensional formulation that emulates\
    \ a one-dimensional plume model using ambient temperature and salinity. It provides\
    \ equations (C2, C3, and C4) for calculating melt rates."
  30: 'Describes three different parameterizations for modeling sub-shelf melting:
    a complex model with equations (C5), a local quadratic parameterization with equation
    (C6), and a non-local quadratic parameterization with equation (C7). The complex
    model varies the effective thermal Stanton number. The local quadratic parameterization
    varies the heat exchange velocity. The ISMIP6 non-local quadratic parameterization
    considers both local thermal forcing and the average thermal forcing over the
    ice-shelf basal surface.'
  31: "Uses quadratic non-local parameterizations (with and without the dependency\
    \ on the local slope) to model melt rates. Applies sector temperature corrections\
    \ derived for MeanAnt median \u03B3 0 values. Applies these temperature corrections\
    \ when using present-day ocean temperature and salinity fields. Values of \u03B3\
    \ 0 are varied to test a range of Antarctic melt rates."
  32: The study uses the Kori-ULB ice-sheet model, with a specific version hosted
    on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8398772). The model is forced with CMIP6
    data and MAR outputs.

More Notes:
  1: The study highlights the importance of both oceanic and atmospheric drivers in
    projecting future Antarctic ice loss and sea-level rise, with a critical temperature
    threshold for the atmospheric contribution.
  2: The page highlights the competition between processes like snowfall accumulation
    (which can mitigate sea-level rise) and basal melting/surface runoff (which can
    accelerate it). The role of ice shelf stability is also emphasized as a key factor
    influencing the overall stability of the ice sheet.
  3: The atmospheric fields projected by climate models are derived under the assumption
    of a static present-day ice-sheet geometry. This leads to biases in the projected
    SMB, especially for long-term projections, because of the melt-elevation feedback.
  4: Mentions parameterizations for surface melt (positive degree-day scheme) and
    basal melt rates (functions of ocean temperature or box/plume models). Notes that
    missing oceanic forcing values are filled following Kreuzer et al. (2021).
  6: Structural errors are estimated as much larger than observational errors, and
    the scores are normalized to avoid bias towards a small number of ensemble members.
  8: The calibrated ensemble is qualitatively assessed with spatially-aggregated estimates
    of ice-sheet net mass balance, surface mass balance, sub-shelf melting, and iceberg
    calving fluxes from recent satellite- and modelling-based studies.
  10: The projected mass loss primarily occurs in the Amundsen Sea Embayment throughout
    the century under both socio-economic pathways. The spread in sea-level projections
    increases with time, especially under the very high-emission scenario.
  12: The ice-sheet net mass balance is interpreted as the rate of mass change contributing
    to sea-level rise, not the sum of all mass balance components. Positive SMB fluxes
    represent mass gains, while positive sub-shelf melt and calving fluxes represent
    mass losses.
  13: West Antarctic ice sheet ocean-driven mass loss dominates. East Antarctica is
    undergoing a median mass gain due to increased snow accumulation until after the
    21st century, eventually becoming a positive contributor to GMSLR due to oceanic
    and atmospheric drivers.
  15: Figure S4 displays mean ice thickness changes under constant present-day conditions
    and SSP1-2.6 for comparison.
  16: The West and East Antarctic ice sheets show contrasting sensitivities to oceanic
    and atmospheric forcing. The melt-elevation feedback plays a role in accelerating
    WAIS collapse and amplifying grounding-line retreat in East Antarctica.
  17: Figure references (4, 5, 6, S5) suggest additional information is available
    in those figures. The study uses the SSP5-8.5 scenario.
  18: Positive SMB, snow accumulation and rainfall fluxes represent mass gains while
    positive surface melt and runoff fluxes represent mass losses.
  19: Warming thresholds are compared to pre-industrial global temperature changes
    to give context to the warming levels. The impact of surface runoff on ice shelf
    breakup via hydrofracturing is mentioned but not elaborated on in this page.
  22: The SSP5-8.5 scenario is considered very unlikely to be followed on multi-century
    timescales. The model tends to underestimate aggregated surface runoff rates compared
    with climate models projections under high warming, potentially due to the omission
    of the melt-albedo feedback and the coarse spatial resolution of the GCMs.
  23: Grounding line and calving front positions are indicated in the figures; results
    are specific to polar regions.
  24: The study acknowledges limitations, including the use of a single ice-sheet
    model, the relatively coarse spatial resolution, and the potential for overlooking
    smaller bedrock irregularities. The CMIP6 models used may have limitations and
    it is not clear whether they have improved relative to the previous generation.
  27: The analysis involves complex glacier and ice sheet dynamics modeling, with
    a focus on methodologies to handle initial conditions and forcings.
  29: This section focuses on modeling ice shelf melt rates using different parameterizations.
    The descriptions are technical and focus on the specific parameters and equations
    used in the models. The methodology includes different ways of incorporating water
    properties and temperature into ice shelf melt rate estimations.

  10: Median contributions to GMSLR of 6 (-8 to 15) cm under SSP1-2.6 and 5.5 (-10
    to 16) cm under SSP5-8.5 by the end of the century. Under SSP5-8.5, contribution
    to GMSLR amounts to 2.75 (0.46 to 4.52) m by 2300 and 6.95 (2.40 to 13.47) m by
    3000, compared with 0.62 (-0.26 to 1.56) m and 1.85 (-0.73 to 2.90) m under SSP1-2.6
    by 2300 and 3000, respectively. Continued retreat of Thwaites Glacier leads to
    a median sea-level contribution of 2 (-6 to 9) cm by the end of this century,
    0.20 (-0.17 to 1.21) m by 2300, and 1.32 (-0.4 to 2.1) m by the end of the millennium
    under constant present-day climate conditions.

    probability intervals for the Antarctic ice sheet contributions to sea level rise.
  12: Probabilistic projections of Antarctic ice sheet mass balance components until
    2300 are provided, including medians and 5-95% probability intervals (N=100 per
    SSP scenario), and [5,25,50,75,95] percentiles at year 2300.
  13: Projects median surface runoff fluxes of almost 6000 gigatons per year by 2300
    under SSP5-8.5; identifies distinct phases of Antarctic mass loss under SSP5-8.5.
  14: Provides median contributions to global mean sea-level rise from Antarctica
    under the SSP5-8.5 scenario with [5,25,50,75,95] percentiles shown at years 3000
    and 2100.
  15: Mean ice thickness change
  16: Oceanic forcing alone produces the highest median Antarctic contribution to
    GMSLR during the 21st century. Atmospheric forcing alone initially leads to mass
    gain (negative median rates of contribution to GMSLR). WAIS mass loss under SSP5-8.5
    is initially triggered by the oceanic forcing, but its collapse is further accelerated
    by increased surface melt due to lowering surface elevations. Both atmospheric
    and oceanic forcing can lead to rates of mass loss in West Antarctica reaching
    approximately 10 mm per year.
  17: A median sea-level contribution increased by 60 cm at year 2300, and by 2.2
    m at year 3000 compared with simulations that do not account for ice-shelf collapse
    through hydrofracturing.

    \ SSP 5-8.5 until 2300, median and 5-95% probability intervals (N=100 per SSP\
    \ scenario). Yearly Bayesian calibrated median surface mass balance, snow accumulation,\
    \ and surface runoff (Gtyr-1) compared with near-surface temperature anomaly (\xB0\
    C)."
  19: "Surface runoff reaches median fluxes of about 4000 Gt/yr by 2300. A +2.5\xB0\
    C Antarctic near-surface warming leads to a decrease in SMB over ice shelves.\
    \ A +7.5\xB0C warming causes surface runoff to surpass snow accumulation on grounded\
    \ ice sheets. Surface runoff fully offsets snow accumulation on ice shelves at\
    \ +7.5\xB0C. SMB reaches its present-day value when near-surface warming approaches\
    \ +9\xB0C. A significant threshold of negative surface mass balance is not projected\
    \ until a strong Antarctic annual near-surface warming of +15\xB0C."
  20: Projections of sea-level contribution by the end of the century range from -8
    to 16 cm by 2100 and from -0.26 to 1.56 m under SSP1-2.6 and 0.46 to 4.52 m under
    SSP5-8.5 by 2300, relative to 2015.

  25: "A factor of 8 or 12 used instead of 10 to estimate structural error would change\
    \ the main projection 5\u201395% intervals by around \xB1 5%. Antarctic near-surface\
    \ warming exceeds +7.5\xB0C, the threshold at which the increase in surface runoff\
    \ outweighs the increase in snow accumulation."
