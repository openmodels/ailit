Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Long-term and gradual climate change during the Little Ice Age (1600\u20131850);\
    \ Temperature."
  3: Relatively cool temperatures as experienced during the Little Ice Age.
  4: Cooler temperatures during the Little Ice Age
  5: Temperature changes (long-term and gradual); Little Ice Age; Economies heavily
    dependent on agriculture; Restricted access to trade; Cyclones; Increased flooding
  8: Changes in growing periods due to temperature variations (shorter growing periods
    reducing the harvest), cool temperatures (Little Ice Age)
  9: Temperature changes, specifically reconstructed annual gridded seasonal temperatures
    for European land areas.
  10: Temperature changes during the Little Ice Age (between 1600 and 1850)
  11: Temperature change, specifically cooling during the Little Ice Age.
  12: Change in mean temperature.
  15: Changes in long-run mean temperature (specifically decreases)
  16: Temperature
  18: Temperature variations, specifically yearly mean temperature, growing-season
    temperature, and nongrowing-season temperature.
  19: Temperature (mean, growing-season, and nongrowing-season).
  20: Temperature changes (growing season, non-growing season)
  21: Temperature changes (specifically agricultural year temperature, growing and
    nongrowing season temperatures).
  22: Temperature variations during the agricultural year, specifically growing-season
    temperature; Distance to market towns.
  23: Agricultural year mean temperature, growing-season temperature, and nongrowing-season

  37: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: Economies increased trade and changed land use to adapt to the Little Ice Age.
  3: Significant negative effect of cool temperatures on city size, consistent with
    historical evidence.
  4: Cooler temperatures increased mortality, likely through effects on agricultural
    productivity; trade volumes increased in response to cooler temperatures; cities
    participating in long-distance maritime trade were less affected by temperature
    change; cities with larger trade opportunities are less affected by temperature
    change; cities surrounded by relatively flat terrain are less affected by temperature
    changes.
  5: Economies with relatively warm temperature had greater increases in the area
    of agricultural land than countries with cooler temperatures; Long-term and gradual
    temperature changes may also have an economic impact; Highlights the particular
    vulnerability of economies that heavily depend on agriculture and have restricted
    access to trade
  8: Small changes in key dates (planting, harvesting) had potentially large effects
    on living standards, particularly when shorter growing periods reduced the harvest.
  9: The study examines the relationship between temperature and economic growth (city
    size) in Europe during the period of the Little Ice Age.
  10: City growth was slowed down by relatively cold temperatures.
  11: A positive relationship between temperature and city size is found, implying
    that a temperature decrease within a city is associated with decreases in city
    size during the Little Ice Age.
  12: There is a positive correlation between change in mean temperature and change
    in city size based on the binned scatterplot.
  15: "Cooler temperatures during the Little Ice Age had a negative effect on city\
    \ size. A 1\xB0C change in long-term temperature may translate into a 27% change\
    \ in economic growth."
  16: Temperature affects city size, with a quantifiable impact of temperature decrease
    on city size.
  18: Higher temperatures in a year are associated with higher yield ratios in the
    same year.
  19: Mean temperature has a statistically significant positive effect on the yield
    ratio of wheat.
  20: Warmer temperatures during the growing season significantly increase yield ratios
    and decrease wheat prices. Temperature during non-growing seasons has no significant
    effect on yield ratios or wheat prices.
  21: Temperature may have affected mortality through its effect on agricultural productivity
    (lower temperatures decrease food production, leading to malnutrition).
  22: Lower temperature during the growing season led to increases in crisis mortality
    in England during the Little Ice Age. Access to markets mitigated the adverse
    effects of temperature on crisis mortality. Places far from markets were significantly
    less resilient to temperature changes compared with places close to markets.
  23: Higher temperatures (agricultural year mean, growing season, and non-growing
    season) are associated with an increased likelihood of a mortality crisis. The
    relationship seems to be statistically significant for agricultural year mean
    temperature and growing season temperature.
  25: The Little Ice Age decreased city size; Parishes with benign climates attracted
    more migrants; Economies potentially increased trade in response to cooler temperatures.
  27: Cooler temperatures lead to increases in the number of incoming ships and the
    value of imported goods; Cities with better access to trade are less affected
    by temperature changes; Larger, possibly more developed, port cities may react
    more strongly to changes in temperature than smaller port cities.
  30: Higher mean temperatures appear to positively affect trade. Cities with more
    trade partners are better able to mitigate the adverse effects of temperature
    changes on trade, although cities that have fewer trade partners also experience
    a positive coefficient.
  31: Trade, particularly with a higher number of trading partners, was an effective
    way of shielding an economy from the negative effects of temperature changes.
  32: Temperature changes have a smaller negative impact on city size (economic activity)
    for cities with higher trade opportunities.
  36: Long-term temperature changes have important effects on economies; Access to
    trade is a key tool in overcoming the negative effects of long-term temperature
    changes; The agricultural sector is a key channel through which temperature affects
    the economy; Agriculture-dependent economies with limited access to trade are
    particularly vulnerable to climate change.

Methodology:
  1: "Study of the economic effects of long-term climate change over 250 years in\
    \ the Little Ice Age (1600\u20131850)."
  3: Panel data set for 2,120 European cities using annual temperature reconstructions
    and city size as proxy for economic growth; city and time fixed effects included.
  4: Investigates temperature's effect on mortality, migration, and trade; examines
    adaptation through trade and changes in land use; uses gravity model of trade
    to construct a measure of potential trade opportunities.
  5: Uses historical data from the Little Ice Age period to examine the effects of
    temperature changes on economies and land use; Uses temperature changes from the
    long-term mean at the city level to identify effects on city size; Analyzes the
    effect of temperature as a factor in the economy's production function
  8: Panel data analysis of European cities' temperature and potential impact on living
    standards during the Little Ice Age (1500-1850)
  9: "The study combines data on European city size from 1600 to 1850 with reconstructed\
    \ temperature data from 1500 onwards. Local mean temperature is calculated over\
    \ the preceding 50 or 100 years before city size data was collected. Regression\
    \ analysis is performed by Voigtl\xE4nder and Voth (2012)."
  10: Panel data set for cities is used to examine whether temperature changes during
    the Little Ice Age affected city size between 1600 and 1850.
  11: The study examines the relationship between temperature and city size using
    data from 2,120 European cities. The analysis includes city fixed effects, time
    period fixed effects, and geographical and historical control variables.
  12: The analysis uses an ordinary least squares regression with city and time period
    fixed effects, historical, and geographic control variables to estimate the relationship
    between city size and mean temperature. The sample is divided into 100 equally
    sized groups to generate a binned scatterplot.
  15: Regression analysis conditional on control variables, relying on the assumption
    that temperature changes are not correlated with other determinants of city size
    besides those controlled for.  Applicable to the early modern period (1500-1850).
  16: Regression analysis with geographic controls, exclusion of fast-growing cities,
    country-level time trends, and country/time period fixed effects. Nonlinear temperature
    effects are estimated by measuring the fraction of years with temperatures in
    specific bins.
  18: Regression analysis using historical yield ratios from Slicher van Bath (1963)
    and temperature data from Luterbacher et al. (2004) for European countries from
    the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries. Location and decade fixed effects are included.
    Panel data is unbalanced and locations with at least 10 independent observations
    are included. Results are applicable to European agriculture in the specified
    time period.
  19: Regression analysis using city and decade or year fixed effects. Bootstrapped
    standard errors clustered at the city level. Sample includes data from 12 European
    cities in France, Germany, Poland, and Sweden for yield data, and 10 European
    cities for wheat price data over multiple years. Control variables include Access
    to Ocean and Atlantic Trader interacted with time period indicator variables.
  20: Regression analysis of wheat prices on temperature with city and year fixed
    effects; also, regression of yield ratio on temperature during growing and non-growing
    seasons.
  21: Regression analysis using panel data of 404 English parishes from 1538-1838.
    The regression controls for geographic and historical variables (distance to Roman
    roads, distance to the ocean, altitude, soil suitability for potatoes, ruggedness)
    interacted with year indicator variables, parish fixed effects, and county/time
    period fixed effects.
  22: Statistical analysis of historical data from England during the Little Ice Age,
    examining the relationship between temperature, distance to markets, and crisis
    mortality. The analysis uses regression models with controls for growing-season
    and non-growing season temperature, and distance to market towns.
  23: The analysis uses regression models with parish-year level data from English
    parishes between 1538 and 1840. Fixed effects are included for parish and county/year,
    and control variables are used. Standard errors are clustered at the temperature
    grid level. The sample is split between parishes closer to and further from market
    towns (4km threshold).
  25: Examines changes in migrant marriage shares in English parishes in relation
    to temperature changes over 50-year periods; Investigates adaptation strategies
    to the Little Ice Age by examining changes in trade and agricultural land use.
  27: Regression analysis; Fixed effects models; Interaction terms to test the hypothesis
    that access to trade mitigates the effect of temperature on city size.
  30: Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with city and time period fixed effects,
    interacting control variables with time period indicator variables. Standard errors
    are clustered at the temperature grid level. The analysis examines historical
    data on trade and temperature.
  31: Regression analysis relating city size to temperature and trade network participation
    (Sound toll and Hanseatic League).
  32: Uses a gravity model for trade; analyzes cities with high vs. low trade opportunities
    (defined by the number and size of nearby cities); also uses exogenous variation
    in travel costs due to ruggedness.
  36: The study analyzes the effects of long-term temperature changes on economies,
    considering factors like trade and agricultural dependence. It appears to analyze
    historical data, with results applicable to agriculture-dependent economies with
    limited access to trade.

More Notes:
  1: The study discusses the relevance of the results for understanding the impact
    of today's climate change, especially in developing countries.
  3: The study includes controls for geographic and historical variables and robustness
    checks to account for omitted variable bias.
  4: The paper focuses on the Little Ice Age as a case study for understanding how
    economies adapt to climate change.
  5: "The paper's relevance is for understanding the impact of today\u2019s climate\
    \ change."
  8: The paper examines adaptation to cool climate as a way to build resilience to
    all kinds of weather shocks. Expanding agriculturally productive land or extending
    trade networks are examples of adaptation measures that would make the economy
    more resilient to weather shocks.
  9: The study uses linear interpolation to fill missing values for time periods between
    nonzero values of city size. The study addresses cities of over 5,000 inhabitants
    between 800 and 1850.
  11: The context is the Little Ice Age, and the results may not be directly applicable
    to current warming scenarios.
  12: Equation (1) indicates that the natural logarithm of city size in a time period
    is regressed on mean temperature, time fixed effects, city fixed effects, and
    other control variables interacted with time period indicator variables.
  15: The analysis focuses on the impact of temperature decreases during the Little
    Ice Age on city size as a proxy for economic growth in early modern Europe. The
    link between city size and economic growth is based on a correlation observed
    in American cities between 1960 and 1990. The starkest temperature decreases occurred
    from the sixteenth to the seventeenth century.
  19: The paper uses historical data to analyze the relationship between temperature
    and agricultural productivity. Wheat prices can serve as an alternative measure
    of agricultural productivity, where yearly fluctuations in wheat prices mostly
    reflect changes in supply.
  20: The analysis examines the relationship between temperature and agricultural
    outcomes during the Little Ice Age.
  21: "The analysis uses mortality data from Wrigley and Scho\uFB01eld (1989) and\
    \ temperature data from Luterbacher et al. (2004)."
  22: The study defines parishes as far from a market if they are more than 4 km away
    from a market. The study also considers the effect of cooler temperatures over
    the past 5 years on mortality.
  23: The dependent variable is an indicator (binary) variable. Control variables
    include distance to Roman road, distance to the ocean, altitude, soil suitability
    for wheat, soil suitability for potatoes and ruggedness, all interacted with year
    indicator variables.
  25: The analysis of migrant marriages relies on limited data (seven English parishes)
    and the result is not statistically significant; The study uses Sound Toll Registers
    (STR 2018) as a data source on European trade in the early modern period.
  30: The coefficients presented are for interaction terms between temperature and
    trade-related variables, suggesting the study is exploring how trade influences
    the temperature-trade relationship. It appears this is trade volume of cities
    at certain locations in Europe, not trade for an entire country.
  31: The decision to join the Hanseatic League may be correlated with other factors
    (human capital, diversified economy) that also helped overcome climate-related
    shocks.
  32: The analysis uses data from early modern Europe.
  36: The paper focuses on adaptation through trade and its impact on agricultural
    productivity and mortality in the context of temperature changes. The study looks
    into the effects of cooler temperatures, such as those from the Little Ice Age.

No relevant information:
  28: There is insufficient context and information to extract any relevant details
    regarding macroeconomic/macro-fiscal risks of climate change and adaptation costs/benefits.
    The snippet primarily presents numerical values alongside variable names like
    "Ships," "ArrivalsNumber," "Trade," and "Temperature" without defining their relationship
    to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, adaptation strategies, or the methodology
    used to derive these values. It is impossible to establish any meaningful connection
    to the review topics based solely on this excerpt.

Quantitative material:
  4: Data on mortality for 404 English parishes between 1538 and 1838; data on location
    of birth and marriage for 6,350 couples in England between 1538 and 1871; data
    from the Sound Toll Registers on 900,000 ship passages to 750 European destinations
    between 1591 and 1857.
  8: Balanced panel of 2,120 European cities with annual temperature data from 1500
    to 1850, temperature changes (cooling) measured for three groups of cities
  9: No specific quantitative information is provided on the outcomes other than references
    to figures and tables.
  10: Roughly 80% of cities in the sample experienced temperature decreases between
    the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. For the remaining cities, average temperature
    change remained close to zero (<0.0167C).
  11: Table 1 presents summary statistics for city size in 1600, mean temperature
    in 1600, city growth from 1600-1850, altitude, ruggedness, potato suitability,
    wheat suitability, and religious affiliation (Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist/Huguenot)
    for all cities, cities with strong cooling, and cities with weak cooling.
  12: "The scatter plot visually represents the relationship between change in mean\
    \ temperature (ranging from -0.2 to 0.2\xB0C) and change in city size (ranging\
    \ from -0.2% to 0.2%). The equation (1) log City Sizeit = b * gMean Temperatureit\
    \ + Time FEt + City FEi + dXit + eit implies a linear relationship is estimated\
    \ with b capturing the impact of temperature on city size."
  15: "A 1\xB0C decrease in long-term mean temperature decreased city size by around\
    \ 70%. The city with the largest decrease in long-term temperature from the sixteenth\
    \ to the seventeenth century experienced a decrease of 0.287\xB0C, leading to\
    \ a 19.6% decrease in city size over a 100-year period. A decrease in temperature\
    \ of 1 standard deviation decreased city size by 5% over a 100-year period."
  16: A 1 standard deviation decrease in temperature decreased city size by 7.3% over
    a 100-year period.
  18: 'Equation (2): Yield Ratiol t 5 b 1 gTemperaturel t 1 Location FE l 1 Decade
    FEd 1 el t : This equation suggests a regression analysis to quantify the relationship
    between yield ratios and temperature.'
  19: A 1 degree Celcius deviation increase in mean temperature increases yield ratio
    by 0.430 (significant at p < 0.01) in one specification and 0.364 in another (significant
    at p < 0.01).
  20: A 1 standard deviation increase in growing-season temperature increases yield
    ratio by 0.58 (up from 5.57, an increase of 10.5%).
  21: The paper estimates the effect of temperature on mortality using a regression
    model (Equation 4) with crisis mortality as the dependent variable. Crisis mortality
    is defined as months where the death rate is more than 10% above a 25-year moving
    average.
  22: A 1 standard deviation decrease in growing-season temperature increased the
    probability that mortality reached crisis level by 4.7% (compared with a mean
    of 5%). A 1 standard deviation decrease in agricultural year temperature increases
    crisis mortality by 8% in places far from markets and by 4.6% in places close
    to markets (though the latter effect is not significant).
  25: Relationship between changes in migrant marriages and changes in temperature
    is positive but not statistically significant; Data on 900,000 ship journeys to
    750 destination ports in Europe representing 3,700 trade relationships between
    the years 1591 and 1857
  27: A 1 standard deviation decrease in growing-season temperature increases the
    number of incoming ships by 3% (6.7% for larger port cities); Taxes were 1%-2%
    of the cargo value.
  30: The paper provides coefficients showing the impact of mean temperature and its
    square on trade, broken down by participation in the Sound Toll Trade and number
    of trade partners. For example, mean temperature has a coefficient of .724***
    on Sound Toll Trade, while mean temperature squared has a coefficient of 2.688***
  31: A 1 standard deviation decrease in temperature is estimated to reduce city size
    by 0.6% for cities in the Sound toll trade but with few trading partners, compared
    to 9.8% for cities that do not participate in the Sound toll trade.
  32: Estimated effect of temperature on city size for cities with high trade opportunities
    is close to zero; estimated effect of temperature on city size for cities with
    low trade opportunities is large and significant at 1%.
