  9: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate variability, economic pressures, inadequate management, globalized trade
    system.
  5: Increase in demand for marine commodities, climate perturbations.
  8: Increase in demand for marine commodities, environmental (production) fluctuations,
    negative climatic signal.
  9: Synergies between global markets and regional climate, technological developments,
    climate change, environmental oscillations, globalization of economic markets.
  10: Climate-induced fluctuations in small pelagic fisheries supply; increases in
    fishmeal demand due to aquaculture expansion; random yearly fluctuation; Environmental
    variability.
  11: Climate change; Environmental conditions (favorable or unfavorable climatic
    cycles); Fishing effort; Inefficient management (poor knowledge of stock status,
    uncertain environmental drivers, aim of maintaining high catches, delayed response
    to scientific assessments); Economic globalization.
Highlights:
  1: A combination of climate-induced variability in fish population production, demand
    for fish products, and inadequate management can drive fisheries into development,
    overexploitation, collapse, and recovery phases.
  5: MSY regulation under conditions of biological equilibrium prevents stocks from
    reaching overexploitation when demand is the only driver. Climate perturbations
    can destabilize the global network when occurring simultaneously with demand expansion,
    leading to vulnerability after full exploitation.
  8: Globalized economic system allows consumer demand to shift between production
    systems, smoothing any negative trend in global supplies, giving the impression
    that a constant high catch is sustainable; however, this stability is maintained
    for approximately two decades before a sequential collapse becomes obvious at
    a global scale; Collapse of a fishery imposes additional pressure on other stocks
    through market equilibrium; MSY catch limits have never been exceeded, and the
    sequence of overexploitation and collapse does not necessarily follow the same
    sequence of full development.
  9: Synergies between global markets and regional climate can trigger a sequential
    overexploitation and collapse of resources. Adaptive regulation can potentially
    manage this situation to secure global sustainability.
  10: Overcapitalization leads to fisheries decline; Stable MSY target management
    is inefficient; Fisheries sequentially become overexploited and collapse.
  11: "Adaptive management can avoid the risk of collapse of fully exploited stocks;\
    \ Adaptive management, under the assumption of full knowledge of the system\u2019\
    s dynamics, would lead to the optimum use of marine ecosystems; Economic globalization\
    \ allows fisheries to be understood as a common issue, requiring international\
    \ agreements."
Methodology:
  1: Uses a global bioeconomic model to explore the synergistic effects of climate
    variability, economic pressures, and management measures.
  5: Simulation modelling of global fisheries over 150 years, driven by demand increase
    and managed using MSY criteria. A third simulation models the impact of climate
    perturbations. Model considers 10 regional fish stocks.
  8: Simulation model incorporating demand, market equilibrium, environmental fluctuations,
    and adaptive management to drive stocks to MSY levels. The model is applied to
    global fisheries over a 150-year period.
  9: Simulations are performed using a network model to represent the interconnectedness
    of global fisheries. The model considers market interactions, environmental conditions,
    and regulatory interventions.
  10: Model simulates fisheries dynamics under various assumptions (e.g., increasing
    demand, random yearly fluctuations, quota systems based on MSY) and management
    strategies; Considers 10 fish stocks to represent world's fisheries; Simulations
    are run with theoretical parameters, but non-dimensional variables are shown.
  11: Simulation model with adaptive management scheme setting quotas based on yearly
    fish stock assessments; Comparison of simplistic vs. perfect adaptive management
    scenarios.
More Notes:
  1: The model demonstrates how a sequential pattern of overexploitation can emerge
    as an endogenous property of the interaction between regional environmental fluctuations
    and a globalized trade system.
  5: The simulations explore the interaction between demand, management strategies
    (MSY), and climate change impacts on fisheries. The simulations track stock biomass
    and fishing effort. Climate change can render previously stable conditions unstable.
  8: The model considers ten regional fisheries and tracks effort, catch, and biomass
    levels.
  9: The model assumes perfect knowledge of the system, which is a strong assumption.
  10: The model simplifies the real world by considering only 10 fish stocks and using
    theoretical parameters; Technological development was initially added, but removed
    due to lack of significant change in results; Model incorporates environmental
    and market drivers (demand, price, substitutes) to simulate fisheries dynamics.
  11: The paper emphasizes the need to reduce uncertainty about climate impacts on
    fisheries, improve stock assessments, and adapt fishing industries to dynamic
    ecosystems.
