Drivers of Risk:
  2: Uncertainty in global mean temperature (GMT) variability is a significant driver
    of economic damages from climate change.
  3: "Global mean temperature anomaly (\u0394T) under different RCP scenarios (RCP8.5,\
    \ RCP6.0, RCP4.5, RCP2.6) and year (2050-2200), Aleatory uncertainty (inter-annual\
    \ temperature variability), Epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty about the equilibrium\
    \ climate sensitivity (ECS))."
  4: Aleatory uncertainty (inherent randomness) and epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty
    due to lack of knowledge, specifically equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS));
    temperature variability and autocorrelation.
Highlights:
  2: Incorporating realistic temperature variability reveals higher climate change
    damage uncertainty, suggesting the benefits of adaptation are greater than previously
    believed.
  3: Inter-annual temperature variability can result in significant risk premia, increasing
    the cost of climate change; Epistemic uncertainty magnifies the cost of inter-annual
    and multi-decadal variability; The risk premia are substantially higher than previously
    estimated, with the addition of stochasticity producing damage distributions with
    a fatter right tail than in the deterministic case.
  4: Adding temperature variability to a simple integrated assessment model results
    in greater economic damages from climate change; the interaction between aleatory
    and epistemic uncertainty reveals trillions of dollars of previously uncounted
    damages.
Methodology:
  2: Analysis involves extending deterministic models to include stochastic temperature
    variability, with a focus on the autocorrelation characteristics of temperature
    to account for broader damage distribution.
  3: The study uses deterministic and stochastic temperature models to project temperature
    trajectories and calculates resulting economic damages, based on ensembles of
    10,000 temperature trajectories with a discount rate of 4.25%. Risk premia are
    calculated by comparing the expected utility of deterministic and stochastic trajectories.
  4: "Uses an ensemble of temperature trajectories from a deterministic Energy Balance\
    \ Model (EBM) for a distribution of ECS values and a second ensemble from a stochastic\
    \ EBM; calculates risk premia as the difference between the expected utility of\
    \ damages for the two ensembles. The ECS is assumed to be log-normally distributed\
    \ with a most likely value of 3 \xB0C and Pr(2 \u2264 ECS \u2264 4.5) = 0.66."
More Notes:
  3: The analysis distinguishes between risk premia (the additional cost of living
    with aleatory uncertainty) and the social cost of carbon (SCC, the cost of releasing
    one more tonne of CO2).
  4: Damages estimates are likely conservative due to the discount rate and the handling
    of temperature autocorrelation; the cost of adaptation is beyond the scope of
    this study, but the benefits are much greater than previously believed; simple
    integrated assessment models are poorly equipped to deal with the consequences
    of temperature autocorrelation.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Global economic damages in Trillion USD, Risk Premium as Trillion USD and as
    a percentage of current global output.
  4: Economic damages from climate change; willingness to pay to avoid aleatory uncertainty
    (risk premium).
Quantitative material:
  2: The deterministic model forecasts $486 trillion in total damages for the RCP8.5
    scenario, while the stochastic model assigns a 5% chance to damages exceeding
    $563 trillion.
  3: "The figure presents quantitative estimates of global economic damages (Trillion\
    \ USD) for different temperature increases and RCP scenarios (e.g., $32 Trillion\
    \ under RCP8.5 at 10\xB0C), as well as risk premia (e.g., +16% or $46 Trillion\
    \ under RCP8.5 at 10\xB0C)."
  4: Presents risk premia (Trillions USD) under different RCP scenarios (8.5, 6.0,
    4.5, 2.6) with and without epistemic uncertainty interaction.
