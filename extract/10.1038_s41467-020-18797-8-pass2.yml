Drivers of Risk:
  2: "Annual global mean temperature anomaly (\u0394T)."
  3: The drivers of risk are temperature trajectories produced by deterministic and
    stochastic models under different RCP scenarios (RCP8.5, RCP6.0, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6),
    and equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). Internal temperature variability also
    drives risk.
  4: The primary drivers of risk are temperature variability and uncertainty in equilibrium
    climate sensitivity (ECS). Specific RCP scenarios (8.5, 6.0, 4.5, 2.6) are used
    to project future climate conditions. Temperature autocorrelation (persistence
    of temperature deviations) is also considered.
Evaluation overview:
  2: Economic damages from climate change, measured as a share of global annual output.
  3: The paper evaluates damages in Trillions of USD, and also calculates the risk
    premium, which is what a social planner would be willing to pay to avoid inter-annual
    temperature variability.
  4: The paper evaluates economic damages from climate change, measured in Trillions
    of USD. It focuses on the costs associated with aleatory (random) uncertainty
    in climate projections, both with and without considering epistemic (knowledge-based)
    uncertainty.
Highlights:
  2: Adding realistic temperature variability creates substantial uncertainty in future
    damages, equivalent to trillions of dollars of previously uncounted for economic
    costs of climate change. Benefits of adaptation are much greater than previously
    believed.
  3: Inter-annual temperature variability and uncertainty about climate sensitivity
    significantly increase the cost of climate change. The risk premia, representing
    the willingness to pay to avoid temperature variability, are substantial. The
    risk premia measures the additional cost of living with aleatory uncertainty as
    compared to living in a deterministic world. Epistemic uncertainty magnifies the
    cost of variability.
  4: Adding temperature variability to simple integrated assessment models results
    in greater economic damages. The interaction between aleatory and epistemic uncertainty
    leads to a significant additional risk premium. The authors suggest current damage
    estimates are conservative due to high discount rates and simplified handling
    of temperature autocorrelation.
Methodology:
  2: "Uses a stochastic model that extends standard deterministic models by incorporating\
    \ variability in global mean temperature (GMT). The model includes effective heat\
    \ capacity (C), forcing (F), feedback parameter (\u03BB), and variance of a zero-mean\
    \ Gaussian noise process (\u03C32Q). The annual damages are then discounted and\
    \ summed across all future years to give an estimate of total economic damages."
  3: The analysis uses deterministic and stochastic temperature models with different
    RCP forcings. It calculates damages based on ensembles of 10,000 temperature trajectories
    and a discount rate of 4.25%. The risk premia are calculated by evaluating the
    difference between the expected utility of the deterministic trajectory and that
    of the ensemble of stochastic trajectories.
  4: "The analysis uses a stochastic energy balance model (EBM) to generate ensembles\
    \ of temperature trajectories, considering both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty\
    \ related to the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). The ECS is assumed to\
    \ be log-normally distributed with a most likely value of 3\xB0C. Risk premia\
    \ are calculated as the difference between expected utility of damages for ensembles\
    \ with and without aleatory uncertainty."
More Notes:
  2: The paper distinguishes between deterministic and stochastic models, arguing
    that deterministic models underestimate the uncertainty and therefore the economic
    costs of climate change.
  3: The paper distinguishes between risk premia and the social cost of carbon (SCC).
    It finds that high draws from the ECS distribution produce both greater mean warming
    and greater variability. The effect of a higher ECS on the variance of temperature
    would be weaker if a fluctuation-dissipation theorem applied.
  4: The paper suggests that the benefits of adaptation to climate change are much
    greater than previously believed, and that societies lacking foresight may be
    particularly vulnerable to longer periods of extreme climatic conditions, such
    as multi-year droughts. Autocorrelation in temperatures, which is not fully captured
    in current integrated assessment models, can lead to disproportionately large
    damages.
Quantitative material:
  2: "Deterministic model forecasts $486 trillion in total damages for the forcing\
    \ scenario RCP8.5. Stochastic model assigns a 5% chance to damages exceeding $563\
    \ trillion (16% higher). 5\u201395% range for the stochastic model is (\u2212\
    13%, +16%) of the deterministic forecast for RCP8.5. For RCP2.6, the 5\u201395%\
    \ range for the stochastic model is (\u221230%, +52%) of the deterministic forecast\
    \ of $30 trillion."
  3: Damages range from $3 Trillion (RCP2.6) to $32 Trillion (RCP8.5) in the deterministic
    model. Risk premia range from 4% to 40% of current global output.  The addition
    of stochasticity can represent from 6% to 13% in additional damages. The risk
    premium to remove aleatory uncertainty under RCP2.6 forcing is $9 trillion when
    epistemic uncertainty about ECS is included. Under RCP8.5 forcing, this risk premium
    is $46 trillion.
  4: Risk premiums are calculated for different RCP scenarios. For example, under
    RCP8.5, the aleatory-only risk premium is 32 Trillion USD, and the risk interaction
    effect (aleatory x epistemic) is 14 Trillion USD, resulting in a total of 46 Trillion
    USD (58%). Similar values are given for other RCP scenarios.
