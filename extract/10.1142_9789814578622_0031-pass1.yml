Drivers of Risk:
  6: No relevant information
  13: Relative Mean Sea Level Rise (RMSLR) and upstream water flows.
  14: Relative Mean Sea Level Rise (RMSLR) and emission scenarios (B1 and A2).
  16: Climate change-induced salinity intrusion
  19: Changes in freshwater river areas and river salinity are expected
  23: Climate change leading to changes in river area and wild habitats.
  24: Changes in river salinity in specific districts (Bagerhat, Barguna, Bhola, Khulna,
    Patuakhali, and Satkhira).
  25: Changes in the salinity of soil; future water flows of the trans-boundary Brahmaputra
    River; Potential overtopping and breaches of polders and embankments in the coastal
    area.
  26: Sea-level rise leading to salinity intrusion in coastal areas.
Highlights:
  6: No relevant information
  14: Climate change will cause significant changes in river salinity in southwest
    coastal Bangladesh by 2050; RMSLR is the primary driver of salinity intrusion;
    the B1 emission scenario with 35cm RMSLR is the best (least salinity increase)
    and the A2 emission scenario with 67cm RMSLR is the worst (largest salinity increase).
  16: Visual representation of saltwater intrusion extent in coastal Bangladesh.
  19: Significant decrease in freshwater river areas and river water availability
    for agriculture under both best and worst-case scenarios. Expected increase in
    river salinity may impact freshwater fish and prawn populations. Shift in species
    composition expected in Sunderbans.
  23: Significant reductions in prime habitats for Catla, Rui, and Mrigal, and Golda
    prawn, particularly in Khulna and Bagerhat districts, are expected under both
    best and worst case climate change scenarios.
  26: Raises awareness and prompts countries to initiate detailed, country-level assessments
    of potential impacts of climate change on salinity in coastal areas, including
    socioeconomic impacts.
Methodology:
  6: River water salinity is modeled using MIKE 21FM and MIKE11 modules.
  13: Global Tide model estimated tides and water level along the coast for alternative
    scenarios of RMSLR. Estimated river flows, tidal effects, salinity of the river
    flows, and salinity of the tides were used to estimate location-specific river
    salinity for the southwest coastal region for December 2049 to March 2050.
  14: The analysis uses Global Climate Models (GCMs) to project river salinity changes
    by 2050 under different emission scenarios and RMSLR levels.
  16: Mapping of isohalines (lines of equal salinity) in the Southwest region of Bangladesh
  19: No relevant information
  23: No relevant information
  24: Assessment of location-specific economic impacts and identification of suitable
    adaptation alternatives are mentioned as priorities for further analysis.
  25: Analysis assumes that the Ganges Water Treaty will hold between Bangladesh and
    India in the future; Analysis assumes away potential overtopping and breaches
    of polders and embankments in the coastal area; Analysis of impacts is restricted
    to exposure to salinity and does not take into account the extent to which adaptive
    capacity exists in the affected areas.
More Notes:
  6: The models aim to estimate river salinity based on water flow, measured salinity,
    and tidal data, but the specific connection to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes
    or the costs/benefits of adaptation is not established on this page. The assumption
    that all polders are functioning well by 2050 is a critical component of the model
    but implies that failure of the polders by 2050 would constitute an increased
    risk relative to the modeled outcomes.
  16: The map shows the situation in March 2012. The data source is U.P 0025615 G040
    project, BARC/SW Maps, dated March 29, 2014.
  19: The "best" and "worst" scenarios are not defined, limiting the interpretability
    of the quantitative results. The impacts described are primarily environmental/ecological,
    with potential (but unquantified) economic consequences (e.g., through agriculture
    or fisheries).
  23: The analysis focuses on specific districts within a nation, and it's important
    to understand how these localized impacts translate into broader macroeconomic
    or fiscal consequences at the national level. The potential for increased brackish
    water aquaculture presents an opportunity for adaptation, but this needs to be
    further evaluated.
  24: High poverty incidence is noted in Bagerhat, Barguna, Bhola, Khulna, Patuakhali,
    and Satkhira Districts, suggesting increased vulnerability to climate change impacts.
  25: Predictions of the future water flows of the trans-boundary Brahmaputra River
    were not attempted because of geopolitical complications.
  26: The analysis aims to trigger actions to protect or facilitate increased resilience
    of coastal assets and activities to imminent climate risks.
