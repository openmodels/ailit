  12: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  9: Changes in the mean and variability of flows under climate change impacting basin
    yield.
  10: Changes in precipitation and runoff triggered by climate change necessitate
    alterations to water storage and management.
  11: Climate change impacting basin yields (both increases and decreases in water
    availability). Water stress levels in basins.
  12: Changes in precipitation and runoff patterns due to climate change (change from
    1961-90 to 2050 era).
  13: Changes in annual runoff and dry season runoff are identified as drivers of
    risk, projected from the 1961-90 baseline to the 2050 era, based on different
    climate model outputs.
  14: Changes in annual precipitation and runoff trends in various river basins due
    to climate change.
  16: Climate change affecting basin yield; basins with decreasing yields incur costs
    to maintain historical yields.
  17: Changes in precipitation and temperature, impacting runoff.
  18: Climate change and rapidly rising global water demand are expected to place
    unprecedented pressures on already strained water resource systems.
  19: Projected river runoff, irrigation water requirements, basin storage yield,
    precipitation, internal variability, multiple model formalisms.
  20: Changes in water demand and availability, driven by changes in precipitation
    and temperature.
  21: Percentage changes in runoff and precipitation in selected river basins.
Highlights:
  9: Basin yield is a useful broad indicator of the climate risk to basin-level water
    resources.
  10: The study examines economic benefits of storage and non-storage options in response
    to changes in basin yields; storage costs from IWMI guide economic estimates.
  11: Identification of regions of high and low agreement between multiple climate
    models and observations regarding annual precipitation and runoff changes. Economic
    benefits are assumed from surplus water only if the basin is water-stressed.
  12: Agreement patterns in certain regions are maintained even when patterns from
    five within-model ensembles are combined. Consistently drying regions include
    northern Africa and southern Europe, southern Africa, the southwestern United
    States and Central America, and Indonesia. Wetting regions include southeastern
    South America, the northeastern United States, eastern and southern Asia, and
    the northern latitudes.
  13: The study projects changes in annual and dry season runoff across 126 basins
    globally, showing both increases and decreases based on various climate models.
    The signal-to-noise ratio highlights areas where the projected change is large
    compared to the interannual variability.
  14: Drying signals emerge in some arid regions during dry season by the 2050 era.
    There is more robust agreement on drying in runoff changes compared to precipitation
    trends in eastern Australia and northeastern South America. Specific basins, such
    as the northeastern United States and eastern Mediterranean Sea, have universal
    agreement across models, suggesting robust trends.
  16: The median annual global net costs of adapting to climate change in the 2050
    era are estimated at $15 billion yr21 (2010 USD, 5% discount rate).
  17: Unexpected degree of agreement in direction of economic outcome across regions.
    Stronger sign agreement in economic effects is due to economic outcomes mapping
    to runoff (which includes the stronger sign agreement in temperature trends) and,
    in many basins, changes in precipitation having a magnified effect on runoff.
    Zero changes in precipitation will still result in costs as a result of the temperature
    effect. In basins such as the Zambezi, Volta, and Niger Rivers, marginal changes
    in precipitation have a magnified effect on economic outcomes, leading to greater
    sign agreement.
  18: The study explicitly shows the limitations of using single models or even single
    ensembles for planning for future changes.
  19: The analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of climate models, showing
    geographic impacts and economic costs under different scenarios.
  20: Agreement across GCM ensembles suggests a high degree of confidence in direction
    of change in water availability in some regions. River runoff projections show
    robust between-ensemble agreement in regional drying (e.g., southern Africa, southern
    Europe, and northern South America) and wetting trends (e.g., northeastern United
    States and northern latitudes).
  21: Reliance on too few models can generate misleading results in regions where
    the direction and magnitude of projected changes are highly uncertain.
Methodology:
  9: Estimation of basin yield through calculation of crop evapotranspiration (ETc)
    and effective precipitation (Pe), followed by calculating IWR as the difference.
    Construction of storage yield curves using the sequent peak algorithm (Wiberg
    and Strzepek 2005, modified from Thomas and Fiering 1962) to relate basin yield
    to basin storage.
  10: Storage yield curves are used to estimate changes needed in storage to maintain
    yields; adaptation responses are calculated using baseline and projected runoff
    values.
  11: The study estimates volume-cost relationships for reservoirs. The price of storage
    is adopted from Ward et al. (2010). The study analyzes spatial patterns of agreement
    and disagreement between water availability and demand metrics.
  12: The analysis examines agreement patterns across multiple within-model ensembles
    (CMIP5 RCP4.5) regarding changes in precipitation. It averages the level of agreement
    as the fraction of ensemble members showing a positive change in sign. Agreement
    patterns in precipitation trends are evaluated over time and with different emissions
    scenarios (RCP8.5).
  13: The analysis uses an ensemble of climate models to project changes in annual
    and dry season runoff. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated by dividing
    the average change in runoff between the 1961-90 baseline and the 2050 era by
    the interannual standard deviation of runoff in the 2050 era. The dry season is
    defined as the lowest three months of the baseline period each year for each basin.
    The results are applicable to projections for the 2050 era.
  14: The signal is calculated as the trend from the 1961-90 period to the 2050 era
    (2040-59), and the noise is the interannual standard deviation of the 2050 era
    (2040-59). The median SNR is reported over the ensemble of models for 126 basins.
  16: Economic effects of climate change estimated by assuming basins with decreasing
    yields incur costs to maintain historical yields, and basins with increasing yields
    gain as economic benefits if water is scarce. Costs are cheaper with increased
    storage or a backstop of $1 m23 of lost yield, whichever is less expensive.
  17: Aggregation of basin-scale costs to seven World Bank regions. Analyzing the
    relationship between precipitation, runoff, and annual costs across 220 model
    runs. The Zambezi basin storage yield curves show historical data, existing storage,
    current yield, storage yield curves for ensemble members, and storage requirements
    to maintain current yields.
  18: The analysis uses multiple climate models (22A1B, 40NCARs, 17ECHAMs, 20C5R8)
    and ensembles to project changes in water storage yield and storage requirements.
  19: Uses a range of available within- and between-model ensembles to explore spatial
    and temporal patterns of high confidence and uncertainty. Analysis includes global
    maps illustrating climate-related data and a box plot graph showing global annualized
    costs.
  20: Analysis uses multiple-member GCM ensembles to project changes in water availability
    and estimate adaptation costs.
  21: The analysis uses 220 model runs to generate scatter plots of runoff/precipitation
    changes against adaptation costs for selected river basins. A fourth-order polynomial
    fit is applied to the points to show the relationship.
  22: The paper involves estimating impacts of climate change on drought and water
    quality in the U.S. using both greenhouse gas mitigation and non-mitigation scenarios.
More Notes:
  9: Climate change can affect all elements of a storage yield curve, including maximum
    yield, minimum yield, and curve slope, serving as an integrator of potential climate
    change effects.
  11: "The analysis is based on model projections for the 2050 era, compared to a\
    \ 1961-90 baseline. The UNESCO World Water Assessment Programme water stress index\
    \ is used. The maps show the fraction of ensemble members showing a positive change\
    \ in annual precipitation and runoff from the 1961\u201390 baseline to the 2050\
    \ era."
  13: The presented maps represent different climate model projections (22A1B, 40NCARs,
    17ECHAMs, 23CSF4, 6R4CCSM, and 10R4CSIRO), illustrating the range of uncertainty
    in projected runoff changes.
  14: The signal-to-noise ratio provides information on when a climate signal is statistically
    significant. Flexible design (De Neufville and Scholtes 2011) as an adaptation
    strategy leverages the SNR to inform infrastructure investments. The authors also
    find that longitudinal differences across GCMs are the bulk of disagreement between
    models.
  16: The study focuses on the economic effects of changes in basin water yield. The
    costs of adaptation are defined as the cost to maintain historical yields in basins
    with decreasing yields.
  17: The paper evaluates agreement among adaptation cost estimates by focusing on
    geographic regions rather than the globe.  The interquartile ranges of costs are
    positive in the MENA and SSA regions, with general agreement on benefits in SA
    and on costs in LAC.
  19: The study examines how a broader range of ensembles better informs evaluation
    of features robust to internal variability and multiple model formalisms. It focuses
    on precipitation as the main driver. Models/scenarios used include '22A1B,' '40NCARs,'
    '17ECHAMs,' '17B1,' '17A2', etc.
  20: Basin yield integrates changes in the mean and variability of projected runoff,
    and is systematically drier than changes in precipitation due to land surface
    dynamics and temperature dependence.
  21: The analysis provides an indicative view of how historical basin yields and
    irrigation water requirements would be affected under projected climate change,
    assuming current population, per capita food consumption, and per capita water
    use.

    precipitation and runoff for various basins. For example, for the Congo River,
    100% of 40NCAR ensemble members and 94% of 17ECHAM ensemble members show a positive
    change in precipitation.
  13: The maps show the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of changes in runoff, with values
    ranging from -2.0 to 2.0, visualized with a color scale (Dark red = -2.0, White
    = 0.0, Dark blue = 2.0). The signal represents the average change between periods,
    and the noise is the interannual standard deviation of the 2050 era.

    Caribbean, and the Middle East and northern Africa; benefits occur in central
    and South Asia.
