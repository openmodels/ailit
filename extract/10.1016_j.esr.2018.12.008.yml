Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on runoff availability for hydropower generation; Constraints
    on hydropower deployment.
  4: Potential development of hydropower is impacted by environmental conservation
    concerns, social problems, and accessibility issues.
  6: Changes in rainfall due to climate change (both increases and decreases), specifically
    focusing on the inter-GCM uncertainty.
  10: Climate change (specifically changes in rainfall leading to 'Dry' or 'Wet' conditions),
    policy choices regarding hydropower development (Boost vs. Constrain), and technological
    availability (e.g., biomass, solar PV).
  11: Climate change (specifically variations in hydropower production), future policy
    decisions regarding hydropower, and the choice of energy policy case (HydropowerBoost,
    HydropowerConstrain, Environment Priority).
Highlights:
  1: Hydropower will remain as one of the most cost-effective and low emission technologies
    in the Ecuadorian power sector in the long term; Climate change impacts and deployment
    constraints could hinder fulfilling NDC targets and create uncertainty around
    long-term power system costs; Strategies to hedge against these risks may require
    complementing hydropower with thermoelectric generation (natural gas, biomass,
    geothermal).
  2: The study explicitly accounts for critical differences in the deployment of hydropower
    in terms of investment and operational flexibility. The uncertainty of climate
    change impact on hydropower production are explored in the context of policy case
    scenarios for an energy system heavily dependent on hydropower.
  4: Ecuador's hydropower potential is estimated to be 22.1 GW, with 4.4 GW already
    installed, 0.7 GW under construction, and 13 GW remaining untapped.
  6: Inter-GCM uncertainty is greater than inter-RCP uncertainty, therefore, paper
    assesses the inter-GCM uncertainty for RCP4.5 only.
  9: Hydropower's share in electricity supply is sensitive to climate change and policy
    choices. Constraining hydropower development increases reliance on natural gas,
    impacting energy security. A dry climate scenario can significantly reduce hydropower
    output.
  10: Constraining hydropower development leads to a large increase in emissions compared
    to boosting hydropower, especially under dry climate conditions. Biomass generation
    becomes important for decarbonization when hydropower is constrained. Climate
    variability impacts hydropower output, with potential for both increases (Wet
    scenario) and decreases (Dry scenario).
  11: The choice of policy case has a greater impact on electricity prices than future
    variations in climate. The Boost Hydropower policy case is the most capital-intensive
    option, while the Constrain Hydropower case is the cheapest. The Environment Priority
    case offers a balance between low emissions and cost.
Methodology:
  1: Energy system optimisation model (TIMES-EC) using climate change scenarios as
    input, examining least-cost options for Ecuadorian power system to 2050 under
    three policy cases.
  2: The paper showcases the first application of the TIMES energy system optimisation
    model (TIMES-EC) to develop a detailed long-term energy system assessment for
    Ecuador. The model calculates the least-cost configuration of technologies required
    to satisfy end-use energy demands, considering changes in the power generation
    matrix due to climate change impacts on hydropower. A mixed-integer linear programming
    (MILP) formulation captures the investment characteristics of large hydropower
    projects, while different availability factor definitions represent electricity
    dispatch for both run-of-river (ROR) and flexible reservoir systems (DAM).
  4: The analysis uses the TIMES-EC model, incorporating techno-economic data for
    power generation technologies; results are based on the Ecuadorian national Electrification
    Master Plan (PME) projections.
  6: 'A two-step approach is used to obtain the availability factor for each river
    basin: (1) Using bias-corrected climate data (precipitation, potential evapotranspiration,
    and temperature) from CMIP5 GCMs to force a statistical hydrological model and
    compute changes in average runoff per month. (2) Using a hydropower electricity
    model to convert runoff into projected availability factors for representative
    existing hydropower stations in each basin. Focus is on the RCP4.5 concentration
    scenario, assessing inter-GCM uncertainty.'
  9: The TIMES-EC model is used to simulate energy system scenarios under different
    climate and policy conditions from 2015-2050.
  10: The TIMES-EC model is used to simulate energy system development under different
    climate and policy scenarios. The model optimizes for the least-cost energy mix
    while meeting constraints on emissions and technology deployment.

    policy cases and climate change scenarios for the period 2015-2050, with figures
    in $US2015.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the Ecuadorian power sector and its reliance on hydropower,
    considering the uncertainty of climate change impacts on water runoff.
  2: The study focuses on Ecuador's power sector and its relevance for Ecuador's NDC
    contribution to the Paris Agreement, and develops a case study specifically for
    Ecuador, but believes the methodology and insights are valuable and replicable
    for strategic energy planning in other hydropower-development states.
  9: The time scale resolution of TIMES-EC does not fully capture the value of DAM
    hydropower flexibility. The model does not explicitly model the effects of higher
    temperatures on thermal plant cooling systems. Ecuador may need to import natural
    gas if large hydropower development is constrained and a dry climate scenario
    occurs.
  10: The model results suggest that even when future climate variations result in
    an increase in rainfall, emissions are almost three times larger when hydropower
    development is constrained, compared to the Boost Hydropower case. The availability
    and cost-effectiveness of alternative technologies (solar, wind, biomass, natural
    gas with CCS) influence the optimal energy mix and associated emissions.
  11: There is a trade-off between social/environmental issues at the local level
    (related to hydropower) and efforts to mitigate GHG emissions at the regional/global
    levels. Constraining hydropower could lead to increased reliance on natural gas
    and higher emissions.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Long-term power system costs; Emissions related to power generation.
  6: The impacts and uncertainties surrounding hydropower resource potential, and
    future Ecuadorian energy system performance.
  9: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes are directly quantified. The paper
    focuses on the share of electricity demand supplied by hydropower and the implications
    for natural gas consumption.

    investment in the electricity sector.
Quantitative material:
  1: The paper uses climate change scenarios derived from a large ensemble of Global
    Circulation Models as input for an energy system optimisation model (TIMES-EC)
    to examine least-cost options for the hydropower-dominated Ecuadorian power system
    in the period to 2050.
  4: The table provides data on Ecuador's power installed capacity from 2007 to 2017,
    with an increase in capacity for hydropower by 117%, other renewables by 180%,
    and fossil fuels by 50%.
  9: The share of electricity demand supplied by hydropower is quantified for different
    policy cases and climate change scenarios for the period 2015-2050 (ranges from
    29% to 86% in 2050). Change in Hydropower output in Wet (+21%) and Dry (-44%)
    scenarios compared to NoCC scenario in Constrain Hydropower policy case. Quantities
    of natural gas use and other power production technologies in different scenarios
    are given.
  10: Electricity-related GHG emissions (GtCO2e) for various policy scenarios (Boost
    Hydropower, Constrain Hydropower, Environment Priority) under different climate
    change scenarios (Dry, NoCC, Wet) for the period 2015-2050 are quantified in Figure
    6. The Ecuadorian NDC emission level is 53 GtCO2e. Emissions can reach 350 GtCO2e
    under the Constrain Hydropower policy case and the Dry climate scenario.
  11: "Figure 7 presents quantitative results for average generation cost (US\xA2\
    /kWh), average marginal cost (Billion US$), and cumulative investment (Billion\
    \ US$) for different policy cases and climate change scenarios for the period\
    \ 2015-2050. Climate change uncertainty causes an uncertainty in average generation\
    \ cost of around 3 US\xA2/kWh. Cumulative investment under the Boost Hydropower\
    \ policy case is around US$65 billion, Constrain Hydropower around US$35 billion,\
    \ and Environment Priority around US$60 billion."
