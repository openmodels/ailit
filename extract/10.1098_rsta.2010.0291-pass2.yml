Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Climate-induced sea-level rise, particularly from the response of the large\
    \ ice sheets of Greenland and West Antarctica; Temperature rise of 4\xB0C or more."
  2: Sea-level rise, submergence/increased flooding, increased erosion, ecosystem
    changes, and increased salinization.
  4: Sea-level rise due to thermal expansion, glaciers, small ice caps, and ice sheets
    (Greenland and Antarctica).
  8: Global sea-level rise, specifically considering scenarios of 0.5 m and 2 m rise
    by 2100.
  11: Sea-level rise, population density, per capita income, costs of dike building,
    tourism revenue.
  12: Sea-level rise of 0.5 m and 2.0 m by 2100.
  13: Sea-level rise (0.5 m and 2.0 m by 2100).
  14: Sea-level rise (0.5 m and 2.0 m by 2100)
Highlights:
  1: Sea-level rise could displace up to 187 million people by 2100, but widespread
    coastal protection could reduce this impact at a cost of up to 0.02% of global
    GDP.
  2: A large rise in sea level by 2100 could have major impacts on coastal areas,
    including potential disruption and displacement of people, economic activities,
    and economic flows.
  8: "A global rise in sea level of 0.5\u20132.0 m by 2100 is consistent with a beyond\
    \ 4\u25E6C world."
  11: The DIVA model explores possible futures under different assumptions about coastal
    planner behavior, translating into differences in impacts and adaptation costs.
    Beach nourishment is preferred if tourism revenue justifies the extra costs.
  12: Land loss and population displacement are significant, especially in Asia.
  13: Dike costs and maintenance represent a significant portion of the adaptation
    costs, especially over the long term.
  14: Without further upgrade to protection (no adaptation), sea-level rise will erode
    and more particularly flood and submerge extensive low-lying coastal areas displacing
    tens to millions of people or more by 2100.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis based on pragmatic estimate of sea-level rise and indicative analysis
    of impact potential.
  4: The paper summarizes IPCC AR4 sea-level rise scenarios and post-AR4 projections,
    comparing model projections with observed changes in ice sheets.
  8: Assessment uses the DIVA model as bounding cases, focusing on the range of uncertainty
    in the recent rate of global mean sea-level rise.
  11: The DIVA model computes impacts with and without adaptation. With adaptation,
    dike heights are raised based on demand for safety, and beaches/shores are nourished
    based on a cost-benefit analysis. The Hamburg tourism model (HTM) is used to model
    tourism flows. Adaptation costs are estimated for dike building and beach nourishment,
    using unit dike costs from Hoozemans et al. [67] and beach nourishment costs derived
    by expert consultation. The adaptation strategies are not intended to compute
    an optimal policy, but to model how coastal managers could respond to sea level
    rise.
  12: DIVA model assuming no adaptation.
  13: The analysis considers scenarios with and without protection (dikes and nourishment)
    against sea-level rise.
  14: The results investigate the impacts and adaptation assuming a rise in sea level
    between 0.5 and 2.0 m with or without upgraded protection by 2100, and provide
    an overview of their implications.
More Notes:
  1: The likelihood of protection being successfully implemented varies between regions,
    and is lowest in small islands, Africa and parts of Asia.
  4: The IPCC AR4 acknowledged limitations in understanding the processes driving
    sea-level rise, precluding a best estimate or upper bound. Rapid changes observed
    in Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets prior to IPCC AR4 were not sustained or
    reproducible by models at the time.
  8: The paper emphasizes the importance of monitoring sea level to detect any large
    or unexpected accelerations of rise and improving process-based models to increase
    the robustness of projections. Regional sea-level rise is noted to vary significantly.
  12: Socioeconomic scenarios assume no coastward migration, which would amplify the
    impact potential.
  13: "The regional spread of adaptation costs is quite variable, with east Asia,\
    \ North America Atlantic, North America Paci\uFB01c, north and west Europe and\
    \ South America Atlantic being the \uFB01ve regions with the highest costs."
  14: The paper highlights the sensitivity of outcomes to assumptions about protection.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Cost of widespread upgrade of coastal protection is up to 0.02 per cent of global
    domestic product (GDP).
  8: Impacts of sea-level rise with and without a protection response.
  11: Costs and benefits of adaptation measures, specifically dike building and beach
    nourishment, in terms of avoided damages.
  12: Land loss and population displacement due to sea-level rise.
  13: Incremental adaptation costs in the form of dike and nourishment responses.
  14: Annual protection cost by coastal region as a percentage of global protection
    investment in 2100.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Sea-level rise between 0.5m and 2m by 2100 for a temperature rise of 4\xB0C\
    \ or more; Potential forced displacement of up to 187 million people over the\
    \ century (up to 2.4% of global population); Cost of protection up to 0.02 per\
    \ cent of global domestic product."
  4: IPCC AR4 sea-level rise scenarios for 2090-2099 range from 48 to 59 cm under
    A1B and A1FI emission scenarios; 66% of sea-level rise attributable to thermal
    expansion in AR4 models; Greenland ice sheet contribution estimated at 8 cm, while
    Antarctica's contribution is -2 cm for the A1B scenario.
  8: "A pragmatic range of 0.5\u20132 m for twenty-first century sea-level rise, assuming\
    \ a 4\u25E6C or more rise in temperature is suggested."
  11: Dike costs are raised offline such that the dike cost for a 2m rise in sea level
    is four times that of a 1m rise; Dike maintenance costs are approximately 1 per
    cent per annum.
  12: 1.2-2.2 million people displaced over the century from the Caribbean, Indian
    Ocean, and Pacific Ocean small-island regions.
  13: "Number of people displaced falls dramatically to comparatively minor levels\
    \ of 41 000\u2013305 000 people displaced over the twenty-\uFB01rst century, assuming\
    \ protection with dikes and nourishment."
  14: Figure 4 shows the annual protection cost by coastal region in 2100, as a percentage
    of global protection investment for 0.5 m and 2.0 m sea level rise.
