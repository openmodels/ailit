Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased greenhouse gas concentrations and enhanced greenhouse forcing impact
    daily surface temperature variability.
  2: Changes in daily temperature variability in boreal winter (DJF), boreal summer
    (JJA), and across the year (annual).
  4: Variability in daily temperature due to increasing greenhouse gas forcing.
  5: Changes in daily temperature variability, surface warming, greenhouse gas forcing
  6: Global changes in daily temperature variability are influenced by anthropogenic
    greenhouse forcing, with the biggest increases projected for low-latitude regions.
  7: Changes in daily temperature variability
Evaluation overview:
  1: The paper evaluates changes in intramonthly daily surface temperature variability
    and its impacts on societal outcomes such as human health, agriculture, and economic
    growth.
  2: No relevant information
  4: Assessment of historical changes in daily temperature variability attributed
    to greenhouse forcing.
  5: No relevant information
  6: The page discusses changes in daily temperature variability and their impacts
    on human and ecological systems.
  7: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: Significant changes in global daily temperature variability patterns are attributable
    to rising greenhouse gas concentrations, with mitigation potentially limiting
    these changes.
  2: Latitudinal polarization in annual and DJF temperature variability changes. Increases
    across the tropics in daily temperature variability. Historical increases in daily
    temperature variability in European summer and across the tropics and wider Southern
    Hemisphere.
  3: Monotonically increasing patterns of temperature variability are detected across
    models, consistent with historical observations and showing strong latitudinal
    dependence.
  4: High degree of spatial similarity between observed changes and modeled responses
    noted, significant in annual and DJF periods.
  5: Historically observed global patterns of change in daily temperature variability
    are extremely unlikely to occur due to natural internal variability. A robust
    scaling between surface warming and variability changes exists. Global climate
    models underpredict the extent to which daily variability changes in response
    to greenhouse forcing and surface warming.
  6: Daily temperature variability changes are consistent with greenhouse gas response
    and have occurred globally, with future projections indicating significant impacts
    and regional inequalities.
  7: No relevant information
Methodology:
  1: State-of-the-art climate models, reanalyses of historical observations, and a
    signal-to-noise-maximizing pattern-filtering technique are used for analysis.
  2: Low-frequency component analysis (LFCA), an extension of traditional principal
    component analysis (PCA), identifies linearly independent modes that account for
    the greatest ratio of low frequency to total variance. Applied to historical reanalyses
    of daily temperature variability. Uses NOAA 20th Century Reanalysis as its main
    specification.
  3: Analysis is based on a multimodel ensemble of 10 bias-corrected CGCMs from CMIP-6
    under historical and SSP-585 scenarios, using LFCA to separate forced responses
    from internal climate variability.
  4: Use of pattern-correlation statistics and LFCA methods to compare historical
    NOAA data with CMIP-6 model outputs.
  5: Analyzes CMIP-6 models and historical observations to assess the relationship
    between changes in daily temperature variability and mean temperature. Changes
    in both variables are estimated for each ensemble member from the lowest-frequency
    component identified with LFCA. Patterns of change are land-area averaged.
  6: The analysis uses CMIP-6 climate models, reanalysis data, and LFCA to assess
    temperature variability. Pattern-correlation statistics are used to attribute
    changes to greenhouse forcing.
  7: LFCA (Low-Frequency Component Analysis) is used to identify interdecadal patterns
    of change from reanalysis and CMIP-6 data; Interdecadal changes are calculated
    between the first and final decades (1950-1960 to 2090-2100) or between pairs
    of nonoverlapping decades separated by 25 years; Least-squares, linear regression
    models are used to assess the covariance of the simulated per-decadal warming
    and variability changes across CMIP-6 models and forcing scenarios.

  2: No relevant information
  5: The latitudinal boundary between increasing and decreasing temperature variability
    varies considerably between models and with longitude. The physical mechanisms
    driving changes in temperature variability are well understood at northern mid
    to high latitudes, but less clear at lower latitudes, although soil drying may
    be a key process.
  7: The study uses CMIP-6 data and reanalysis data (NOAA 20th Century Reanalysis
    and ERA5).
Quantitative material:
  1: By the end of the century, daily temperature variability is projected to increase
    by up to 100% at low latitudes and decrease by 40% at northern high latitudes
    under a business-as-usual emissions scenario.
  2: Increases and decreases of up to 40% and 20% over the past 65 y in daily temperature
    variability.
  4: Spatial correlations and pattern correlations between observed and simulated
    responses in daily temperature variability.
  5: Similarity of historically observed response to forced response is significant
    at least at the 1% level in the annual and DJF cases and at the 10% level in the
    JJA case when considering only spatial similarity. When considering both spatial
    similarity and magnitude, the similarity is unmatched in CMIP-6 control runs in
    all seasons, therefore significant at least at the 0.24% level.
  6: Observed changes in daily temperature variability of up to 40%, projected to
    change by a further 100% by the end of the century under a business-as-usual emissions
    scenario.
  7: Continental, area-weighted averages of changes in mean temperature and daily
    temperature variability are calculated from the interdecadal patterns of change.
