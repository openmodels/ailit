Drivers of Risk:
  1: Enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations and changes in daily temperature variability
    (increases at low to mid latitudes, decreases at northern mid to high latitudes).
  2: Changes in daily temperature variability driven by greenhouse gas concentrations.
  4: Increasing greenhouse forcing leading to changes in daily temperature variability.
  5: Changes in daily temperature variability are linked to warming and greenhouse
    gas forcing.
  6: Changes in daily temperature variability (measured as the SD of daily surface
    temperature within a given month of a given year); greenhouse gas emissions
Highlights:
  1: Daily temperature variability changes with distinct global patterns as greenhouse
    gas concentrations rise; changes are attributable to enhanced greenhouse forcing.
  2: Detection of historical increases in daily temperature variability in European
    summer and across the tropics and wider Southern Hemisphere.
  3: LFCA can identify externally forced signals from a single climate model with
    greater accuracy than ensemble averages. Strong latitudinal dependence is seen
    in the patterns of change in daily temperature variability.
  4: Observed historical changes in daily temperature variability can be attributed
    to increasing greenhouse forcing with a high degree of spatial similarity. Spatial
    similarity between observed and forced responses is significant with respect to
    natural internal climate variability.
  5: Historically observed changes in temperature variability are larger than those
    predicted by climate models, emphasizing the inadequacy of current models in projecting
    future variability changes.
  6: The global response of the high-frequency climate system has already caused changes
    in daily temperature variability of up to 40%, which are projected to change by
    a further 100% by the end of the century under a business-as-usual emissions scenario.
    These changes are likely to have strong impacts on human and ecological systems
    across the globe, and exacerbate regional inequalities and climate injustices.
Methodology:
  1: Uses reanalyses of historical observations and a multi-model ensemble from the
    Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, along with a signal-to-noise-maximizing
    pattern-filtering technique. The period it applies to is changes over the past
    65 years, and projections to the end of the century.
  2: Uses Low-Frequency Component Analysis (LFCA), an extension of Principal Component
    Analysis (PCA), to identify spatial patterns with coherent low-frequency temporal
    evolution in historical reanalyses of daily temperature variability from NOAA
    20th Century Reanalysis and ERA-5. LFCA separates externally forced climate signals
    from internal multidecadal variability.
  3: Uses a multimodel ensemble of 10 bias-corrected Coupled Global Circulation Models
    (CGCMs) from CMIP-6 under the SSP-585 emissions scenario to project daily temperature
    variability from 1950 to 2100. Applies Lowest-Frequency Component Analysis (LFCA)
    to identify the forced response from internal climate variability.
  4: The study uses Lowest-Frequency Component Analysis (LFCA) to identify historical
    changes in daily temperature variability from NOAA 20th Century Reanalysis and
    to estimate the expected response to greenhouse forcing from the CMIP-6 ensemble.
    Pattern correlation statistics (centered and uncentered) are used to assess the
    similarity between observed and simulated changes. Control runs of the CMIP-6
    ensemble are used to estimate internal climate variability.
  5: The study uses data from CMIP-6 climate models and historical reanalyses to analyze
    changes in daily temperature variability and their scaling with average continental
    warming.
  6: Uses a multimodel ensemble of CMIP-6 climate models; employs a Linear Frequency
    Component Analysis (LFCA) method; uses pattern-correlation statistics
More Notes:
  1: Changes in daily temperature variability are identified as an important determinant
    of societal outcomes. Mitigation of greenhouse gases can limit changes in daily
    temperature variability.
  2: The study uses historical data and climate models (CMIP-6) to identify patterns
    of change in daily temperature variability. The focus is on separating externally
    forced signals (like greenhouse gases) from internal climate variability. The
    study finds latitudinal polarization in temperature variability changes.
  3: "The analysis focuses on daily temperature variability and its changes under\
    \ greenhouse forcing, not directly on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. The figure\
    \ shows interdecadal changes (1950\u20131960 to 2090\u20132100) due to the lowest-frequency\
    \ component."
  4: The analysis focuses on the annual, DJF, and JJA seasons. Discrepancies between
    models are concentrated in North Africa and at northern mid to high latitudes,
    particularly in JJA. The uncentered pattern correlation (C) is generally lower
    than the centered correlation (R), suggesting that the magnitude of the simulated
    response is weaker than the observed response during the historical period.
  5: The study identifies that variability changes are linked to surface warming,
    and highlights regional differences in temperature variability changes due to
    factors like geography and ocean currents.

Quantitative material:
  1: Projects daily temperature variability to increase by up to 100% at low latitudes
    and decrease by 40% at northern high latitudes by the end of the century under
    a business-as-usual emissions scenario.

    over the past 65 years, with particularly strong percentage increases across the
    tropics.

    between observed and simulated temperature variability changes.
  5: Patterns of change in temperature variability are discussed, but no specific
    economic quantitative measures are provided.
  6: Daily temperature variability changes of up to 40% have already occurred, projected
    to change by a further 100% by the end of the century under a business-as-usual
    emissions scenario (SSP-585).
