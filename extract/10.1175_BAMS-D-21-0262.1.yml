  14: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  3: Increase in the frequency and intensity of high-impact and extreme weather and
    climate events; Exponential population growth and demographic shifts (e.g., urbanization,
    increase in coastal populations)
  6: Population growth, demographic shifts including urbanization and movement to
    coastlines, global 'just in time' manufacturing, increased reliance on data and
    information technology.
  7: Technological advancements and the speed of innovation in weather and climate
    forecasting can pose a risk to stakeholders who struggle to keep up, potentially
    impacting their ability to provide necessary services to society and the economy.
  14: The text discusses advancing weather and climate forecasting, implying extreme
    weather events and climate change as drivers of risk. It also mentions disaster
    impacts-responses.
Highlights:
  6: Improved insight into weather variations would positively impact revenue for
    global executives with an estimated growth in annual revenue exceeding $500 billion
    (U.S. dollars).
  14: The page highlights potential breakthroughs from using ML in various aspects
    of weather forecasting, including improved utilization of observing systems, better
    data assimilation, advanced postprocessing, improved nowcasting and rainfall estimation,
    detection of severe weather, and identification of likely forecast failures.
Methodology:
  7: The paper summarizes the views, knowledge, and expertise of a group of scientists
    and practitioners from public, private, and academic sectors. It identifies technological
    trends and possible impediments to progress in weather and climate forecasting.
  14: The page focuses on using AI and ML techniques in numerical prediction systems
    and weather forecasting, including data assimilation and postprocessing algorithms.
    This involves community-based modeling, data initiatives, and R&D consortia, emphasizing
    private-public partnerships and international collaborations.
More Notes:
  7: The paper focuses on the innovation cycle in weather and climate forecasting,
    emphasizing the importance of infrastructure, R&D, and operations, and the engagement
    of public, private, and academic sectors. It does not directly quantify macroeconomic
    or fiscal risks of climate change or the costs and benefits of adaptation.
  14: The page emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, sustained
    funding strategies, and addressing funding challenges to advance weather and climate
    forecasting. Open-source AI/ML frameworks and cloud infrastructures are mentioned
    as enablers for developing applications, particularly by small and medium-sized
    enterprises with interdisciplinary expertise.
