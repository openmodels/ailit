Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changing world (implied climate change)
  3: Increase in the frequency and intensity of high-impact and extreme weather and
    climate events; exponential population growth; demographic shifts (e.g., urbanization,
    increase in coastal populations).
  4: Increase in extremes in heat, drought, rainfall, wildfire, tropical cyclone intensity,
    and flooding due to a warming climate; nonclimatic global trends including biodiversity
    loss, unsustainable consumption of natural resources, degradation of ecosystems,
    human demographic shifts including rapid urbanization, social and economic inequalities,
    and a pandemic; dramatic loss of Arctic sea ice.
  5: Meteorological events (tropical storms, local windstorms, tornadoes), Hydrological
    events (flood, mass movement), Climatological events (extreme temperatures, droughts,
    forest fires)
  6: Weather, climate, water, ocean, and space hazards; urbanization; demographic
    shifts; and the global 'just in time' manufacturing process.
  10: No relevant information
  16: Increases in observational datasets, movement of NEWP systems to ensembles operating
    at high resolution, and attempts to observe and predict more components of the
    Earth system increase the difficulty in handling datasets.

  16: This paper discusses challenges related to utilizing large datasets and the
    next-generation weather prediction (NEWP) in different societal sectors, particularly
    focusing on low-income countries and national meteorological and hydrological
    services (NMHSs).
Highlights:
  1: Advancing weather and climate forecasting for our changing world
  3: The article discusses challenges in advancing weather and climate forecasting
    and proposes a vision for key actions across the private, public, and academic
    sectors, including utilizing new observational and computing ecosystems, advancing
    Earth system models, benefiting from AI, improving communication of forecast information,
    and reducing detrimental impacts, especially on low-income nations.
  4: Extreme weather events are increasing, driven by climate change and other global
    trends, and disproportionately impact low-income nations and marginalized populations.
  5: Noticeable increase in the number of registered weather-related loss events from
    1980-1985 to 2013-2018. Increase in the density and spread of events globally.
  6: Demographic trends mean more people, assets, and essential services are exposed
    and vulnerable to weather, climate, water, ocean, and even space hazards.
  10: The private sector's role has grown to include providing global satellite-based
    measurements, targeted high-resolution modeling, and climate risk products utilized
    by corporations and governments.
  14: Machine learning can improve data assimilation, increase precision and speed
    for forecasting, and detect severe weather such as tornadoes and damaging winds.
  15: Improved forecasts and better utilization of forecast information will require
    investments in the global observing system, especially for sparsely populated
    parts of the world and oceans. Investments will also be needed in the supercomputing
    capability that is necessary to create weather and climate information of high
    accuracy, resolution, and reliability to address growing societal needs.
  16: High-resolution global ensemble modeling systems may make local models appear
    to be a waste without adding value. Downscaling forecast data from global ensembles
    using AI can be valuable for various national impact sectors, especially for low-income
    countries. Implementing NEWP systems in the cloud may offer a more sustainable
    and cost-effective approach. Stabilizing national observing networks in low-income
    countries and ensuring their long-term maintenance are of paramount importance.
Methodology:
  1: Advancing weather and climate forecasting
  3: "Concise summary of the white paper on the Future of Weather and Climate Forecasting\
    \ (2021) put together by the World Meteorological Organizations\u2019 Open Consultative\
    \ Platform."
  5: Data from Munich Re, NatCatService, 2019 database. Events are categorized as
    meteorological, hydrological, or climatological and plotted geographically.
  10: Climate risk products are obtained by combining historical observations of extremes
    with the output of ensemble-based climate models from research institutions, downscaling
    with high-resolution models, and artificial intelligence approaches.
  14: The paper discusses the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning
    to advance weather forecasting, incorporating them into numerical prediction systems.
  15: "An integrated system-of-systems approach should be used with considerations\
    \ of scope, complementarity, and cost\u2013benefit analysis across all space and\
    \ time scales."
  16: The paper proposes downscaling forecast data from global ensembles using AI
    for various national impact sectors, especially low-income countries. This involves
    using reforecast data, training scientists from NMHSs in applying these approaches
    to local scales, and utilizing national observations for calibrations. The paper
    also suggests implementing NEWP systems with postprocessing, production, and visualization
    in the cloud.
More Notes:
  1: The paper appears to be about advancements in weather and climate forecasting,
    potentially relevant for understanding and predicting climate impacts. The article
    was published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.
  3: The paper emphasizes the need for improved cooperation between the public, private,
    and academic sectors to address these challenges.
  5: Events are classified by size of loss, with catastrophes marked by larger, dark
    icons.
  6: This paper argues that increased collaboration between the public, private, and
    academic sectors will help meet growing demands for forecasts, sustain national
    meteorological and hydrological services, and foster economic development.
  10: WMO plays a critical role in fostering data sharing and furthering the progress
    of weather and climate forecasting through programs like the World Weather Watch
    (WWW).
  11: This page primarily describes the infrastructure and international collaboration
    for weather and climate forecasting, rather than direct climate impacts. It focuses
    on the centers responsible for producing forecasts, not the impacts themselves.
  14: The application of machine learning in meteorology includes better model error
    estimation, improved postprocessing of variables, and efficient replacement of
    traditional forecasting approaches.
  15: The document emphasizes the importance of collaboration between weather and
    climate researchers, public-private partnerships, and international cooperation
    to improve weather and climate forecasting.
  16: Development assistance projects have often provided disappointingly low impacts
    on local capacity, primarily due to a focus on equipment rather than long-term
    maintenance, capacity building, and data management. Partnerships between the
    private, public, and academic sectors are useful in fostering development and
    sustaining the NEWP enterprise.
