Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme heat.
  2: Increase in exposure to temperatures above 33 /C14 C results in sharp declines
    in agricultural TFPs
  3: Climate change (warming temperatures, extreme heat)
  4: Impact of climate change on agricultural yield and TFP in the short and long
    run
  5: Temperature changes (heat accumulation), rainfall, sunshine duration, relative
    humidity, and wind force.
  6: "Rising temperature, specifically exposure to growing degree days (GDD) above\
    \ 33\xB0C"
  7: Daily average temperature, daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature,
    daily average precipitation, daily total solar duration, daily average humidity,
    daily average wind force
  8: Extreme heating significantly reduces agricultural yield in the short run.
  9: Temperature (Growing Degree Days above and below threshold, Extreme Heat), Precipitation,
    Sunshine duration, Humidity, Wind Force
  10: Temperature, measured as Growing Degree Days (GDD) above and below a threshold
  11: Future global warming, extreme heat.

Highlights:
  1: "Extreme heat has negative effects on China\u2019s agricultural TFP and input\
    \ utilization, which results in a more negative effect on agricultural output\
    \ measured by yield; Longer-run adaptation has offset 37.9% of the short-run effects\
    \ of extreme heat exposure on TFP; Projections of impacts under future climate\
    \ change scenarios still imply a substantial loss in China\u2019s agriculture."
  2: "An increase in exposure to temperatures above 33 /C14 C results in sharp declines\
    \ in agricultural TFPs. Long-run adaptations appear to have mitigated 37.9% (95%\
    \ CI, 5.3%\u201354.8%) of the short-run impacts of extreme heat exposure on China\u2019\
    s agricultural TFPs."
  3: "Climate change is expected to have a significant negative effect on China\u2019\
    s agricultural production, with the effect increasing in the long term. Climate\
    \ adaptation is occurring, but future global warming is still expected to make\
    \ a significant negative effect."
  4: Climate change impacts yield and TFP negatively in the short run but adaptation
    may improve yield impact over TFP in the long run
  5: Compares short-run and long-run impacts to quantify climate adaptation, testing
    the null hypothesis of 'zero adaptation' to extreme heat.
  6: "Exposure to GDD below threshold slightly promotes agricultural TFP, but GDD\
    \ above threshold leads to a sharp decrease in agricultural TFP. There is a nonlinear,\
    \ inverse U-shaped effect of temperature on agricultural TFP, with the turning\
    \ point around 33\xB0C."
  7: Average temperature in China increased between 1981-2015. Average sunshine duration
    decreased in China between 1981-2015. There is spatial variation in average temperature
    across Chinese counties.
  8: Extreme heating has a 71% larger negative impact on yield compared to TFP impacts.
  9: Extreme heat has negative short-run effects on China's agricultural yield and
    TFP, but adaptation has offset 46.8% and 37.9% of these effects, respectively.
  10: Increased temperatures (GDD above threshold) have a statistically significant
    positive impact on agricultural TFP and Yield in China. Adaptation measures offset
    a significant portion of the negative short-run impacts of temperature changes
    in the longer run. The extent of climate adaptation has gradually amplified in
    the most recent period.
  11: Future global warming will significantly lower China's agricultural TFP and
    yield. Climate adaptation offsets a portion of the TFP reductions. Climate adaptation
    for agricultural output shows a larger offset than agricultural TFP.
  12: Adaptation decreases in the long term, suggesting limited adaptation in agriculture
    without new policy interventions.
  13: 'Future climate adaptations in agriculture are thereby emerging from two pathways:
    adaptation in agricultural TFP and adaptations in agricultural input portfolio.'
  14: Impacts of temperature on agricultural TFP vary significantly depending on whether
    the temperature is above or below a certain threshold. The effect of GDD above
    the threshold on TFP generally increases with the threshold temperature.
  15: Temperature above certain thresholds significantly impacts agricultural TFP
    and other variables; Adaptation rates range from 15.04% to 78.50% depending on
    variables and estimation methods
  16: The study quantifies the impact of temperature (GDD above threshold) on agricultural
    TFP and yield in China. It also calculates an adaptation rate, measuring how much
    of the short-run impact of temperature is offset by adaptation.

Methodology:
  1: Using a county-panel dataset spanning the past 35 years, we evaluate the impact
    of global warming on agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) as well as the
    impacts on agricultural inputs and outputs in China; Stochastic frontier analysis
  2: Panel estimates suggest that piecewise linear function yields results similar
    to those estimated using more complicated functional forms.
  3: "The study uses estimated coefficients from an econometric model with different\
    \ future climate change scenarios to project the effect of future warming on China\u2019\
    s agriculture. The econometric analysis is performed using a long study period\
    \ of 35 years and a specific spatial pattern at the county level. The results\
    \ are applicable to China."
  4: Stochastic frontier analysis and panel data approaches applied to agricultural
    production process and TFP estimates
  5: Long differences approach (comparing agricultural outcomes between two periods),
    panel long differences approach (two-period panel data), piecewise linear approach
    to model temperature effects, and temperature bins approach as robustness check.
    The applicability is China from 1981 to 2015 at county-level.
  6: "Piecewise linear regression approach using growing degree days (GDD) below and\
    \ above a threshold, county and year fixed effects, additional weather controls,\
    \ and agricultural land weight. Also, temperature bins approach with every 3\xB0\
    C temperature bin."
  7: "Summary statistics are based on a 2495 unbalanced county panel over the period\
    \ 1981\u20132015 for agricultural output and inputs, and 820 weather stations\
    \ with daily records for weather variables. Time trends of average temperature\
    \ and sunshine duration are presented for China from 1981-2015. Cross-county average\
    \ temperature is mapped."
  8: Panel estimates using different TFP models to assess yield impacts under varying
    temperature conditions.
  9: Panel data analysis with fixed effects (county and year), regressions weighted
    by 1981-2015 county-average farm area, standard errors adjusted for spatial correlation
    and clustered at county level. Also uses long differences estimations to account
    for farmers' adaptation. The weather condition of a county is estimated by taking
    the weighted average of all weather stations within 100 km radius of the centroid
    of that county.
  10: Panel data analysis and long difference analysis using county-level data from
    China. Panel estimations include county and year fixed effects, additional weather
    variables (polynomials in precipitation, sunshine duration, humidity, and wind
    speed), and weighted regressions by county-average farm area. Long difference
    estimations used 5-year differencing periods. Standard errors are adjusted for
    spatial correlation and clustered at the county level. Bootstrap procedure to
    quantify the uncertainty of climate adaptation.
  11: The study uses estimated coefficients of GDD (Growing Degree Days) below and
    above threshold in a baseline model to project the impact of future global warming
    on agricultural TFP in China, using climate data from WorldClim-Global Climate
    Data under four RCPs. The impact of climate change on labor, fertilizer, and machinery
    is also analyzed.
  12: Compares short-run and long-run responses to climate change to assess adaptation.
  14: Annual panel regression with county and year fixed effects; spatial correlation
    and clustering at county level are accounted for.  Regression weighted by 1981-2015
    county-average farm area.
  15: Piecewise linear approach to estimate impacts; regressions with long differences
    and panel differences; spatial correlation adjustments with county-level clustering
  16: Panel and long difference regressions are used. IDW radius is 200 km for panel
    estimates in Table A4. Long difference regressions are used with 5-year lengths
    of differencing period. Spatial correlation adjusted standard errors are clustered
    at the county level. Bootstrap estimates with 1000 repetitions are used to analyze
    adaptation rates. CRS is assumed in some analyses.

  10: The study focuses on the agricultural sector in China and uses Growing Degree
    Days (GDD) as a measure of temperature impact. The specific TFP measurements vary
    across columns. Adaptation is defined as the percentage of short-run negative
    impacts offset in the long run. The confidence intervals for adaptation rates
    derived from bootstrap procedures are also provided.
  11: The climate adaptation offset on yield reduction will decrease in the long run.
    The projected reductions in agricultural output are nearly twice as large as the
    decline in agricultural TFP. Extreme heat has a significant negative impact on
    labor and fertilizer.
  12: The difference between the impact on TFP and yield is due to the negative effect
    of extreme hot weather on labor and fertilizer usage.

  10: GDD above threshold has a statistically significant positive impact on both
    log(Agricultural TFP) and log(Yield). The magnitude of the impact varies depending
    on the estimation method (panel vs. long difference) and the TFP measurement used.
    Specifically, panel estimates suggest a GDD above threshold coefficient of around
