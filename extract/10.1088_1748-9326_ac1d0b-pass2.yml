Highlights:
  2: Climate feedbacks account for a relatively minor increase in SCCO2 compared to
    other updates. Economy feedbacks demonstrate a manifold increase in the SCCO2
    resulting from partially persistent economic damages, especially in the Global
    South. Interannual temperature variability increases the width of the SCCO2 distribution.
  3: PAGE-ICE model is extended to quantify effects on SCCO2, including long-term
    temperature growth feedbacks, mean annual temperature anomalies, and existing
    feedbacks like permafrost carbon and surface albedo.
  4: The PAGE-ICE model includes new elements like permafrost carbon feedback, persistent
    climate-induced damages, and recalibrated damage modules for discontinuity and
    market damages.
  5: Models annual temperature variability to be constant over time. Implements and
    analyzes the persistence of economic damages from climate change.
  6: The mean SCCO2 for PAGE-ICE is double the value for PAGE09. This increase is
    attributed almost entirely to increased social costs in the Global South. Empirically
    derived level of damage persistence affects both the size of global GDP and its
    regional distribution by vast amounts, dominating the effect of any other modeling
    choice.
  7: High levels of damage persistence could lead to significant income redistribution,
    reducing GDP and increasing SCCO2 estimates; the potential for catastrophic effects
    exists as damage persistence increases.
  9: Key outcomes include the widening of SCCO2 distribution tails due to temperature
    variability, impacting market damages and the potential economic impact on GDP.
  10: Damage persistence is a critical factor in calculating the SCCO2. Considering
    annual temperature anomalies leads to large increases in uncertainty about climate
    change risks. The assumption of zero persistence in CB-IAMs (Cost-Benefit Integrated
    Assessment Models) may lead to bias in SCCO2 estimates.  For SSP1-1.9, models
    without growth effects produce lower SCCO2 values compared to SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5.
    Higher GDP projections in SSP5 lead to stronger discounting of future damages,
    producing lower SCCO2 values compared to SSP2-4.5.
  13: A one standard deviation decrease in the tolerable temperature before a discontinuity
    occurs triggers the discontinuity in this particular case, thus leading to a substantial
    increase in the SCCO2.
  14: Table A1 shows that the transient climate response (tcr_transientresponse) has
    the largest positive impact on SCCO2 from a one standard deviation increase. Table
    A2 indicates that the tolerability of discontinuity (tdis_tolerabilitydisc) has
    the largest positive impact on SCCO2 from a one standard deviation decrease, and
    the transient climate response (tcr_transientresponse) has the largest negative
    impact.
  15: The parameter values differ across SSPs and between GDP per capita and population,
    indicating varied assumptions about economic and demographic development under
    different climate change scenarios.
  17: Damage persistence can have catastrophic impacts on welfare. Boundaries on per
    capita consumption and equity-weighting are introduced to smooth out discontinuities
    in results. Overall damage estimates are highly sensitive to the level of the
    equity weighting threshold.
  18: The paper discusses how to estimate the long-run marginal impact of temperature
    on growth, which can identify damage persistence based on its ratio to the immediate
    marginal impact. The paper also notes that if damages are not fully persistent
    over time, the sign of the temperature lag coefficient will be positive in the
    regression model. If damages worsen over time, the sign of the temperature lag
    will be negative.
  19: Persistence of damages is reduced with additional temperature lags, suggesting
    possible upward bias with fewer lags.
  20: Temperature impacts on GDP per capita growth are quantified with persistence
    evaluated through various regression specifications.
  21: The figure shows the effect of the damage persistence parameter on regional
    GDP levels for different model years for SSP2-4.5 runs.
  22: Low-pass filtering generally yields higher persistence levels but a lower Monte
    Carlo mean SCCO2, primarily due to an increased share of Monte Carlo runs reaching
    the maximum damage threshold, leading to a SCCO2 of zero. The study also explores
    regional heterogeneity in damage persistence by repeating the estimation procedure
    for rich and poor countries.
  23: Temperature has a statistically significant impact on GDP per capita growth.
    The relationship between temperature and GDP per capita growth appears to be non-linear
    (as indicated by the significant negative coefficient on temperature squared).
  24: Temperature lag coefficients are used to derive estimates of damage persistence.
    Point estimates for lower-income subsample range between 73.29% and 112.45% for
    different filter periods.
  25: The table shows the coefficients for temperature variables, indicating the impact
    of temperature on GDPpc growth. There is evidence of damage persistence from previous
    temperature shocks.
  26: Temperature and Temperature squared have statistically significant impacts on
    GDP per capita growth, particularly for the unfiltered and 3-year filtered data
    when GDP per capita is above the median. The effect of temperature squared is
    negative. The relationship differs for countries above and below the median GDP
    per capita.
  27: The study explores the impact of varying damage persistence decay rates on the
    SCCO2 estimate under SSP2-4.5. High decay rates significantly reduce the SCCO2,
    while low decay rates can increase it compared to the default assumption of no
    decay.
  28: Finds strongly positive changes in local interannual mean temperature variability
    over the tropics, especially Amazonia, and little increase over Europe (see Figure
    C1); Does not find global or PAGE-ICE region-specific evidence that justifies
    increasing or decreasing temperature variability with rising global temperatures
    in simulations.
  29: Controlling for either a smoothed GMST predictor or an auto-regressive term
    reduces the average correlation of the residuals across regions by half.
  31: "Regional temperature and global mean surface temperature have statistically\
    \ significant impacts on the dependent variable, indicated by asterisks (\u2217\
    \u2217\u2217 p<0.01, \u2217\u2217 p<0.05) next to the coefficients."
  33: Day-to-day temperature variability reduces economic growth.
Methodology:
  2: Compares the PAGE-ICE model with the decade older PAGE09. Extends PAGE-ICE with
    economy feedbacks and includes an estimate of interannual temperature variability.
  3: The PAGE-ICE model is used to simulate climatic and economic developments between
    2020 and 2300, with improvements over previous models to include Arctic feedbacks
    like permafrost thawing and albedo changes.
  4: PAGE-ICE uses Monte Carlo sampling of over 150 parameter distributions to provide
    distributions of results, and it evaluates scenarios using Tier 1 scenarios of
    ScenarioMIP.
  5: Implements a persistence parameter into the growth system such that current GDP
    depends on previous GDP, growth rate, and a fraction of previous economic damages.
    Models global and regional temperature variability using autoregressive equations
    (Eq 1a and 1b) fit to historical temperatures using least-squares regression and
    LOESS.
  6: The SCCO2 is calculated using the PAGE-ICE model under the SSP2-4.5 scenario.
    The model incorporates climate feedbacks, economic factors, and damage estimates.
    Monte Carlo simulations are used to quantify uncertainty. Panel regression analysis
    is used to estimate the persistence of economic damages.
  7: The analysis uses the PAGE-ICE model and Monte Carlo simulations with fixed and
    empirically derived persistence distributions to assess GDP impacts and SCCO2
    values.
  9: Analysis performed using simulations and Monte Carlo runs with different configurations
    of the PAGE model, incorporating interannual temperature variability.
  10: Uses the PAGE (Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect) model, including versions
    with integrated climate and economy (PAGE-ICE).  The analysis considers different
    climate and socioeconomic scenarios (SSPs), climate feedbacks (permafrost thawing,
    surface albedo), annual temperature variability, and damage persistence. A global
    model of damage persistence with no regional disaggregation is used.
  11: The model uses a two-step approach, fitting initially simplified results and
    then using a full model to improve Bayesian convergence.
  13: "The SCCO2 impact is calculated as the difference between the SCCO2 for the\
    \ mean of the respective parameter\u2019s Monte Carlo distribution, and the SCCO2\
    \ for a parameter value equal to the mean value increased (or decreased) by one\
    \ standard deviation, while all other parameters remain at their default value.\
    \ This is based on the default PAGE-ICE model for SSP2-4.5 (deterministic run)."
  14: A deterministic run of the PAGE-ICE model under the SSP2-4.5 scenario is used.
    The SCCO2 impact is calculated as the difference between the SCCO2 for the mean
    of the parameter's Monte Carlo distribution and the SCCO2 for a parameter value
    equal to the mean value increased or decreased by one standard deviation, holding
    all other parameters at their default values. Only parameters with an absolute
    SCCO2 impact of at least $2 are displayed. The analysis is applicable to assessing
    the sensitivity of the SCCO2 to changes in specific model parameters.
  15: "The table presents parameters used in a population and income extension model\
    \ for different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The parameters \u03B4 and\
    \ \u03B2 likely relate to the model's equations for projecting GDP per capita\
    \ and population growth."
  16: Monte Carlo simulations are utilized to derive SCCO2 values, accounting for
    different variability models and observation uncertainties.
  17: The PAGE-ICE model is used, incorporating Monte Carlo simulations. The model
    incorporates damage persistence and equity-weighting. Boundaries are introduced
    to avoid infinite equity-weighted damages when regions approach zero consumption.
    A logistic path is used to smooth out the effects of these boundaries. The SCC
    (Social Cost of Carbon) is also estimated.
  18: The approach relies on fixed effects regressions of economic growth on temperature
    and other variables. The models include lags of temperature to account for the
    persistence of damages over time. Persistence is quantified as the ratio of the
    long-run marginal impact of temperature to the immediate marginal impact.
  19: Analysis uses a lagged regression model based on Burke et al. (2015) with considerations
    for the bias-variance trade-off, and incorporates a Butterworth low-pass filter
    approach from Bastien-Olvera and Moore (2021).
  20: Analysis involves a regression model with temperature lags and precipitation
    controls, implementing a low-pass filter for climate data focused on 3, 5, and
    10-year periods.
  21: Monte Carlo simulations are used to assess the effects of the damage persistence
    parameter on regional GDP levels for different model years for SSP2-4.5 runs;
    5000 bootstrap samples are created by drawing with replacement from country clusters
  22: The paper explores persistence in temperature impacts using low-pass Butterworth
    filters (3, 5, and 10 year) on temperature data from Burke et al. (2015). Persistence
    is estimated as the asymptotic marginal impact of temperature divided by the asymptotic
    marginal impact without filtering. Bootstrap resampling is used to generate confidence
    intervals for persistence. The sensitivity of SCCO2 to the persistence estimate
    is also evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations.
  23: Regressions are performed on data from Burke et al. (2015). Standard errors
    are clustered at the country level. Percentiles are estimated via 5000 cluster
    bootstrap samples. Low-pass filters of 3, 5, and 10 years are applied to temperature
    data. Persistence is estimated.
  24: Baseline regression model by Burke et al. (2015) is applied to countries with
    GDPpc below the median. Regression models include precipitation, country and year
    fixed effects, and country-specific time trends. Models with k temperature lags
    also include k precipitation lags. Author's calculations based on the data provided
    by Burke et al. (2015).
  25: The analysis uses a regression model with GDPpc growth as the dependent variable
    and temperature (including squared terms and lags), precipitation (including lags),
    country and year fixed effects, and country-specific time trends as independent
    variables. The model is applied to countries with GDPpc above the median. Monte
    Carlo simulations are used to estimate the persistence of damage.
  26: The analysis uses regressions with country-level clustered standard errors.
    The regressions are performed separately for countries below and above the median
    GDP per capita. Different low-pass filters (3-year, 5-year, 10-year) are applied
    to the climate variables. Percentiles are estimated via 5000 cluster bootstrap
    samples.
  27: Monte Carlo simulations were performed under different annual decay rates of
    damage persistence for SSP2-4.5. Historical temperature data from Ilyas et al.
    (2017) was used. Interannual temperature variability was computed as the long-term
    average of the 11-year standard deviations after detrending the annual temperature
    anomaly data using a local 11-year running mean for the period 1986-2015.
  28: Calculates annual standard deviations of detrended temperatures over 11-year
    periods; Computes local means of standard deviation before and after 1986; Uses
    a land-sea mask and cosine of latitude for spatial aggregation of HadCRUT4 grid
    data to PAGE-ICE regions; Applies a 30-year running window for linear detrending;
    Uses LOESS smoothing to represent underlying climatic temperature; Decomposes
    annual temperature variability into autocorrelation, smooth trends, and random
    variability using regression models
  29: Assumes that residual temperature variation is uncorrelated across regions,
    after accounting for GMST and regional auto-regression.
  31: An autoregressive model is used to analyze the relationship between regional
    temperature, global mean surface temperature, and a dependent variable (unspecified
    on this page) by region. Observations = 168.
  33: Integrated assessment models (IAMs), panel analysis, scenario modeling
More Notes:
  2: Robust quantification of climate-economy feedbacks and climate extremes are essential
    for estimating the SCCO2 and its uncertainty.
  4: The PAGE-ICE model expands on climate-economic interactions and feedback loops,
    emphasizing long-term socioeconomic growth impacts and refined damage calculations.
  6: The AR5 Updates bar is not represented as a difference. Changing the order in
    which changes are introduced can lead to minor changes in the values presented.
  10: The study acknowledges limitations due to the global nature of the damage persistence
    model and calls for further research on growth effects, particularly in the Global
    South.
  13: Changes in the discontinuity sector and the model design of PAGE09 are contributing
    to differences in annual model reports of SCCO2.
  14: The tables present parameter sensitivities and do not provide a comprehensive
    climate impact assessment, but instead focus on the SCCO2. The study uses the
    default PAGE-ICE model for the SSP2-4.5 scenario. Table A2 includes a note that
    a one standard deviation decrease in the tolerable temperature before a discontinuity
    occurs triggers the discontinuity, leading to a substantial increase in SCCO2.
  15: Figure A5 shows extended SSP population and per capita GDP for SSP2 and SSP5,
    including 95% credible intervals, though the exact method and meaning are unclear.
  18: "The paper references two approaches to determining a point estimate for the\
    \ persistence of market damages: setting persistence to a low arbitrary value,\
    \ or using an empirical approach. The regression model by Burke et al (2015) which\
    \ informs PAGE\u2019s market damage function is quadratic in temperature."
  19: The document discusses the challenges of estimating damage persistence due to
    the bias-variance trade-off and noise introduced by additional lags.
  22: The paper investigates whether considering longer time horizons for persistence
    via low-pass filtering climate variables produces substantially different damage
    persistence behavior compared to assessing persistence via lag coefficients. The
    results suggest that it does not, for the data used in the study. The study acknowledges
    the strong assumption of a global persistence parameter and explores regional
    heterogeneity.
  24: The asterisk notation indicates statistical significance levels (p<0.05, p<0.01,
    p<0.001).
  25: The analysis builds upon the data provided by Burke et al. (2015). The persistence
    is mainly driven by persistence in regions with lower GDP per capita.
  27: The study acknowledges the possibility of adaptation efforts reducing vulnerability
    to climate change, making the assumption of extrapolating previous persistence
    levels too pessimistic.
  28: The analysis utilizes the Ilyas et al (2017) dataset and coarse HadCRUT4 grid.
  29: The regions used in PAGE are chosen for economic coherence, rather than climatological
    distinctness.
  30: No relevant information
  31: The dependent variable is not explicitly named on this page, but it is described
    as something modeled with an autoregressive model and dependent on temperature.
    Standard Errors are listed as Std.Errorual
Quantitative material:
  2: PAGE-ICE yields SCCO2 values about two times higher than PAGE09 due to climate
    and economic updates.
  5: "Uses standard deviations (\u03C3) of internal temperature variability derived\
    \ from spatially aggregated regional mean temperatures."
  6: "The mean value of the SCCO2 in 2020 from the previous version of the model,\
    \ PAGE09, is $158. Updating the CO2 climate sensitivity and other climate parameters\
    \ to conform to IPCC AR5 increases the mean SCCO2 to $217. Applying a fat-tailed\
    \ (Gamma) distribution to sea-level rise increases mean SCCO2 to $228. The permafrost\
    \ feedback increases it to $244. Modeling non-linear transitions in the sea ice\
    \ and land snow albedo feedback slightly reduces the SCCO2 to $239. Reducing the\
    \ size, threshold, and lag of discontinuity impacts reduces the mean SCCO2 slightly\
    \ to $213. PAGE-ICE has a longer simulation period (until 2300), which further\
    \ increases the mean SCCO2 to $239. Updating the baseline income levels increases\
    \ mean SCCO2 to $245. Adjusting the vulnerability of regions in PAGE-ICE increases\
    \ the mean SCCO2 to $281. The final mean SCCO2 for PAGE-ICE is calculated as $307\
    \ per tonne. The interquartile range is $147\u2013$349, and a 5%\u201395% range\
    \ of $82\u2013$831. 50.1% (34.5%\u201369.0%, interquartile range) of GDP damages\
    \ persists as impacts on growth."

    SSPs and models.
  17: The World Bank's threshold for extreme poverty of $1.90 (2011 PPP) per day is
    converted to $2015, resulting in a minimum per capita consumption level of $740.65
    per year. Damages are equity-weighted up to 99% of a region's per capita consumption.

    under the lag-based approach to $3025. The share of Monte Carlo runs with a SCCO2
    of zero increases from 62% under the lag-based approach to 69% based on low-pass
    filtering.

  27: "An annual decay of 3% or higher in damage persistence greatly reduces the estimated\
    \ marginal damages of CO2 emissions. A decay rate of 4%\u20135% per year in damage\
    \ persistence results in a SCCO2 of $305\u2013312, similar to the PAGE-ICE model\
