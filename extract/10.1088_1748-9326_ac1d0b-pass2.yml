Drivers of Risk:
  3: Climate change-induced damages include climatic extremes and interannual climate
    variability, impacting climate-economy interactions.
  4: Rising temperatures, greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O, etc.), and sea
    level rise are the primary drivers of risk. The model includes feedbacks such
    as permafrost carbon feedback and albedo feedback, and also incorporates persistent
    climate-induced damages affecting GDP pathways and emissions.
  5: Temperature changes impacting GDP are modeled, considering persistence of economic
    damages.
  6: Climate feedbacks (CO2 climate sensitivity, sea-level rise, permafrost, surface
    albedo, discontinuity impacts), baseline income levels, vulnerability to market/non-market
    damages, persistence of economic damages, time horizon of simulation.
  7: Climate change impacts (temperature increases), damage persistence (persistence
    of economic damages from climate change).
  8: Temperature-induced economic damages, persistence of damages, annual temperature
    variability
  9: Interannual temperature variability, climate scenarios (SSP2-4.5), temperature
    anomalies
  10: Temperature anomalies (warm and cold years), climate change, damage persistence,
    internal variability in the climate system, radiative forcing, emission trajectories.
  12: Pulse size of CO2 emissions (in Gt), inclusion of annual temperature variability
    in the model.
  13: Changes in model parameters, specifically related to the PAGE-ICE model.
  15: SSP (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways)
  16: Temperature changes impact GDP growth; high persistence of damages might cause
    economic collapse of some regions.
  18: The primary driver examined is temperature changes and their lagged impacts.
  19: Temperature shocks impacting economic variables.
  20: Temperature (linear and squared terms), precipitation

  22: No explicit shocks or changes directly impacting outcomes are discussed on this
    page.
  23: Temperature and its variance impact GDP per capita growth.

Highlights:
  3: Extending the PAGE-ICE model provides an exploration of the magnitude and uncertainties
    of climate and economy feedbacks and interannual variability contributions to
    the SCCO2.
  4: The paper presents results for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCCO2) across various
    climate outcomes and socioeconomic developments, using the PAGE-ICE model with
    updated climate and damage modules. A key extension is the inclusion of persistent
    climate-induced damages that affect GDP pathways.
  5: Economic damage persistence remains constant over time due to limited evidence
    for successful adaptation; different assumptions for persistence are tested for
    robustness.
  6: Updating the PAGE09 model to PAGE-ICE results in a doubling of the mean SCCO2,
    primarily attributed to increased social costs in the Global South; Empirically
    derived damage persistence significantly affects global GDP and its regional distribution.
  7: The persistence of climate damages leads to a considerable redistribution of
    income to the detriment of poorer regions. Even a small amount of damage persistence
    leads to a substantial increase in the Social Cost of Carbon. Under the empirical
    persistence distribution, the mean global GDP is significantly lower by 2100 and
    2200.
  8: High persistence and low adaptation leads to a substantial share of Monte Carlo
    runs producing SCCO2 estimates of zero due to the damage cap; Annual temperature
    variability widens SCCO2 uncertainty ranges.
  9: Interannual temperature variability widens the tails of the SCCO2 distributions.
    The introduction of temperature variation increases SCCO2 values due to interaction
    with the temperature-damage function.
  10: Damage persistence is one of the most important factors in calculating the SCCO2.
    Considering annual temperature anomalies leads to large increases in uncertainty
    about climate change risks.
  12: Annualizing the PAGE-ICE model framework reduces modeling artifacts present
    in multi-year timestep models. Inclusion of annual temperature variability affects
    SCCO2 estimates compared to models with only annual temperatures.
  13: A one standard deviation decrease in the tolerable temperature before a discontinuity
    occurs triggers the discontinuity, leading to a substantial increase in the SCCO2.
  14: The parameter with the largest positive impact on SCCO2 from a one standard
    deviation increase is 'tcr_transientresponse' (100.88). The parameter with the
    largest negative impact on SCCO2 from a one standard deviation increase is 'ptp_timepreference'
    (-63.29). The parameter with the largest positive impact on SCCO2 from a one standard
    deviation decrease is 'tdis_tolerabilitydisc' (617.53). The parameter with the
    largest negative impact on SCCO2 from a one standard deviation decrease is 'tcr_transientresponse'
    (-82.96).
  15: "The parameters \u03B4 and \u03B2 for GDP per capita and population are provided\
    \ for each of the SSPs (1-5). The extended SSP population and per capita GDP for\
    \ SSP2 and SSP5 are visualized in Figure A5."
  16: The paper calculates the Social Cost of Carbon Dioxide (SCCO2) under various
    scenarios and model specifications, considering growth effects and persistence
    of damages.
  18: The study finds that if damages are not fully persistent over time, immediate
    negative GDP impacts can be followed by compensating impacts, indicating that
    not all temperature-induced damages persist.
  19: Including additional temperature lags reduces estimated persistence of economic
    impact from climate change significantly, with potential implications for the
    perceived duration of impact.
  20: "The table shows the impact of temperature and temperature squared on GDP per\
    \ capita growth, as well as the implied persistence (\u03C1) for models with different\
    \ lag structures."
  21: "The study examines the effect of the damage persistence parameter (\u03C1)\
    \ on regional GDP, and uses bootstrapping to derive empirical persistence distributions.\
    \ The empirical persistence distribution cannot be derived from the variance-covariance\
    \ matrix of a single regression if the climate variables are filtered. "
  22: Low-pass filtering yields higher persistence levels, yet the Monte Carlo mean
    SCCO2 decreases using this method. The share of simulations with an SCCO2 of zero
    increases when using low-pass filtering.
  23: The effect of temperature on GDP per capita growth shows diminishing persistence
    with lag and suggests variability across income groups.
  24: "The persistence of temperature impacts on GDP growth (\u03C1) varies considerably\
    \ depending on the number of temperature lags included in the model, ranging from\
    \ 100% to -94.29%."
  25: Temperature has a statistically significant positive impact on GDP per capita
    growth, while temperature squared has a statistically significant negative impact.
    Lagged temperatures can have negative impacts. The persistence of damage varies
    substantially depending on the number of lags included, and this is reflected
    in the Monte Carlo percentile results.
  26: The impact of temperature on GDP per capita growth is different for countries
    below and above the GDP per capita median.
  27: The degree of damage persistence significantly impacts the estimated marginal
    damages of CO2 emissions and the SCCO2. Adaptation efforts can limit the vulnerability
    of capital stocks to climate change. Decay rates of damage persistence can dramatically
    affect the estimate of the SCCO2.
  30: Models including CO2 concentration and a LOESS of observed GMST explain a larger
    amount of variance in GMST than models using just Year as a predictor.
Methodology:
  3: The PAGE-ICE model simulates climate and economic developments from 2020 to 2300,
    updating PAGE09 with improved representations of climatic processes and economic
    damages, focusing on Arctic feedbacks.
  4: The PAGE-ICE model uses Monte Carlo sampling of over 150 parameter distributions
    to provide distributions of results. The SCCO2 is calculated as the difference
    in global equity-weighted damages between two runs (one with an emission pathway
    and one adding a CO2 pulse), divided by the pulse size, and discounted to the
    base year (2015). The model setup recognizes that deterministic assessments of
    the SCCO2 carry limited information. The model is run using Tier 1 scenarios of
    ScenarioMIP including SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP5-8.5 and SSP2-RCP4.5.
  5: GDP growth is impacted by a persistence parameter introduced into the Burke et
    al. model; PAGE model annualizes inputs and considers temperature variability
    without sectoral distinctions.
  6: Monte Carlo simulations (50,000 runs) using the PAGE-ICE model under the SSP2-4.5
    scenario, panel regression analysis using historical temperature and GDP data.
    The results for SCCO2 pertain to the year 2020, expressed in 2015 USD. The simulation
    period for PAGE-ICE extends to 2300.
  7: "The study uses the PAGE-ICE model, incorporating growth effects and damage persistence.\
    \ Monte Carlo simulations are performed to assess uncertainty. Results are calculated\
    \ for SSP2-RCP4.5. The model has a cap for total climate change damages set to\
    \ the exogenous statistical value of society ($6.13\xD710^16)."
  8: Uses the PAGE-ICE model, explores the effect of adaptation reducing damage persistence
    by a constant annual rate
  9: The PAGE model is used with Monte Carlo simulations to project climate damages
    and SCCO2 under different scenarios, considering interannual temperature variability
    and socioeconomic factors. The results for SCCO2 are based on data within the
    0.5th to the 99.5th percentile range.
  10: The study uses the PAGE and PAGE-ICE models under different scenarios (SSP1-1.9,
    SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5) to calculate the Social Cost of Carbon (SCCO2).
    The analysis incorporates temperature variability, damage persistence, climate
    feedbacks, and growth effects.
  12: Monte Carlo simulations (50,000 runs) using the PAGE-ICE model (and its variants);
    Exponential interpolation of population, sea level, and abatement costs; linear
    interpolation of GDP and emissions growth rates.
  13: Deterministic run of the PAGE-ICE model for SSP2-4.5; calculating the difference
    in SCCO2 between the mean parameter value and a value one standard deviation higher
    or lower; focuses on the year 2020.
  14: The analysis uses the PAGE-ICE model under SSP2-4.5 (deterministic run) to assess
    the impact of parameter changes on the Social Cost of Carbon (SCCO2) in 2020.
    It examines the impact of increasing or decreasing each parameter by one standard
    deviation from its Monte Carlo distribution mean, while holding other parameters
    at their default values. The SCCO2 impact is calculated as the difference between
    the SCCO2 at the mean parameter value and the SCCO2 at the parameter value changed
    by one standard deviation.
  15: The page describes a population and income extension model. The results are
    applicable under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).
  16: "Monte Carlo simulations (50,000 runs) are used to estimate SCCO2 values; PAGE\
    \ integrated assessment model is employed; incorporates growth effects via a persistence\
    \ parameter (\u03C1) that reduces economic growth based on the share of economic\
    \ damages; convergence system used near thresholds to avoid discontinuities in\
    \ SCC results"
  18: The analysis uses fixed effects regressions and a lag model to assess the persistence
    of temperature impacts on economic growth.
  19: Regression analysis using temperature lags and a ratio of long-run to immediate
    impacts; includes a Monte Carlo simulation for persistence estimates.
  20: Regression analysis with country and year fixed effects, as well as country-specific
    time trends. The model uses various numbers of temperature and precipitation lags
    (up to 5). Low-pass filtering is applied to temperature and precipitation observations.
    The analysis is performed using the data by Burke et al (2015).
  21: Monte Carlo simulations and bootstrapping techniques (drawing with replacement
    from country clusters to create 5000 bootstrap samples) are used. Analysis is
    based on unfiltered or filtered climate variables and two different regression
    models.
  22: Analysis uses a low-pass Butterworth filter to assess implied persistence of
    temperature impacts, comparing results with a lag-based approach. It includes
    Monte Carlo simulations to assess the Social Cost of Carbon (SCCO2) distributions.
  23: Analysis performed through regression of GDP per capita growth on temperature
    variables with different low-pass filters (unfiltered, 3-year, 5-year, 10-year)
    and income-based subsampling.
  24: The analysis uses a regression model with GDP per capita growth as the dependent
    variable, and temperature, temperature squared, precipitation, country and year
    fixed effects, and country-specific time trends as independent variables. The
    regressions are performed on countries with GDP per capita below the median. Different
    models include varying numbers of temperature lags. Author's calculations are
    based on the data provided by Burke et al. (2015). Results applicable to countries
    with below-median GDP per capita.
  25: The analysis uses a regression model with country and year fixed effects, country-specific
    time trends, and lagged temperature and precipitation variables. The model is
    based on Burke et al. (2015) and is applied to countries with GDP per capita above
    the median. Monte Carlo simulations are also used to assess the range of potential
    outcomes.
  26: Regression analysis of GDP per capita growth on low-pass filtered climate variables
    (temperature and temperature squared), separated for countries below and above
    the median GDP per capita; Standard errors are clustered at the country level;
    Percentiles are estimated via 5000 cluster bootstrap samples.
  27: Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate SCCO2 under varying damage persistence
    decay rates. Historical data is used to calibrate the estimate of damage persistence.
    The results are based on the PAGE-ICE model.
  30: Linear regression models are used to predict annual global mean surface temperature
    (GMST) based on different combinations of year, CO2 concentration, and a LOESS
    smoothed time series of GMST. An autoregressive temperature model is also simulated.
    An alternative model without auto-regression that accounts for observational uncertainties
    is specified.
More Notes:
  5: No significant regional-specific parameters for persistence are used due to reduced
    data significance.
  6: The PAGE-ICE model incorporates climate feedbacks and economic updates in a series
    of steps, each influencing the SCCO2. The order in which these changes are introduced
    can lead to minor changes in the presented values due to interaction effects.
    Regional empirical damage estimates in PAGE-ICE account for potential benefits
    of global warming in cooler regions.
  7: The model's total climate damage cap can lead to an underestimation of the Social
    Cost of Carbon under high damage persistence scenarios, as additional CO2 emissions
    do not increase overall damages once the cap is reached. One outlier run was omitted
    for calculating Monte Carlo means of absolute GDP.
  8: The substantial increase in the SCCO2 is primarily driven by the adverse implications
    for the Global South.
  9: The study examines the impact of temperature variability on climate damages using
    the PAGE model, focusing on GDP losses and SCCO2 as key metrics. It also analyzes
    climate and socioeconomic scenarios.
  10: The study used a global model of damage persistence without regional disaggregation.
    Future research should focus on advancing the understanding of growth effects
    in the Global South.
  12: The PAGE model uses modules to enhance its functionality and flexibility, which
    is based on Mimi-PAGE (Moore et al 2018) and PAGE-ICE (Yumashev et al 2019).
  13: The study notes differences between its annual SCCO2 distributions and the original
    model, attributing this to changes in the discontinuity sector and the model design
    of PAGE09.
  14: The study focuses on the impact of parameter uncertainty within the PAGE-ICE
    model on the Social Cost of Carbon. The tables only display parameters with an
    absolute SCCO2 impact of at least $2.
  15: The 95% credible intervals provided in Figure A5 suggest a probabilistic element
    to the projections.
  16: The paper introduces a subsistence bound on consumption and limits equity weighting
    to damages less than or equal to 99% of consumption to address issues with economic
    collapse and infinite utility.
  20: The paper mentions discarding countries with less than twice the minimum periodicity
    (2 x 10 = 20) of temperature/precipitation observations for the filtering to work,
    which slightly reduces the number of country-year records from 6584 to 6535. The
    paper also compares the estimated marginal impacts for different minimum periodicities
    to explore if growth impacts of temperature shocks intensify, remain constant,
    or converge over time.
  22: Regional heterogeneity of damage persistence is noted, with an acknowledgment
    of differing adaptation barriers across countries and contexts.
  25: The share of runs with an SCCO2 of zero decreases from 62.3% to 61.7% after
    analysis.
  26: The low-pass filters applied to temperature are 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year
    filters.
