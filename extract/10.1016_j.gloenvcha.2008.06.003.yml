Drivers of Risk:
  1: Higher temperatures and decreased precipitation due to climate change.
  2: Adverse climate change affecting agriculture, especially subsistence farming;
    Rising temperatures; Changes in hydrological systems impacting river flows and
    water resources.
  5: Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring temperatures; Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring
    precipitation; soil type (vertisols, acrisols, arenasols, xerosols); mean runoff;
    irrigation; farm type (large-scale farms)
  6: Climate variables (summer temperature, fall temperature, winter temperature,
    spring temperature, summer precipitation, fall precipitation, winter precipitation,
    spring precipitation), soil type (acrisols, arenosols, xerosols), mean runoff
  7: Climate variables such as temperature and precipitation; soil types like acrisols,
    arenosols, and xerosols; and hydrology factors such as runoff affect crop net
    revenues.

    HadCM3, PCM) for 2050 and 2100.

Highlights:
  1: Policies need to be fine-tuned to harness relative benefits across seasons, farming
    systems, and regions to potentially make climate change beneficial rather than
    harmful.
  4: The analysis attempts to capture information on net farm revenues, land values,
    and income variability across representative sample districts and agro-climatic
    regions.
  5: Irrigated farms had the highest net revenues, followed by large-scale farms,
    small-scale farms, and dryland farms.
  6: Climate variables have significant influences on crop net revenues in South Africa.
    There is a non-linear relationship between climate variables and crop net revenues,
    especially for precipitation. Irrigation and farm type (large-scale vs. small-scale)
    are significant positive influences on crop net revenues. The importance of all
    the three sets of variables (climate, soils, and hydrology) in explaining changes
    in crop net revenues
  7: Climate variables are especially significant for dryland and small-scale farming.
    Irrigation mitigates adverse effects of climate variables, while increased precipitation
    generally improves net revenues, except during certain seasons or for small-scale
    farms.
  8: Increased temperature generally leads to positive mean annual impacts on crop
    net revenue. Increased precipitation has mixed effects, with some provinces experiencing
    benefits and others experiencing negative impacts. The timing of rainfall is important;
    early rainfall in the summer and winter farming seasons is generally beneficial.
  9: "Dryland farms will be more affected by increased temperatures and decreased\
    \ rainfall. Small-scale farmers will also be more affected. For 2050, crop net\
    \ revenues are expected to fall by US$ 5.14\u201316.26 (or 1.7\u20135.3%) per\
    \ hectare for the whole of South Africa."
  10: Temperature increases can have a positive impact on annual crop net revenues
    for all farms except dryland farms, but this masks seasonal differences.
  11: Adaptation could mitigate negative impacts and enhance benefits; irrigation
    is a crucial factor in managing adverse effects of climate change.
  12: Temperature and precipitation variables in different seasons significantly impact
    crop farming net revenue. Soil types such as vertisols, acrisols and arenosols
    also significantly influence crop farming net revenue.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis is conducted using a revised Ricardian model and farm household
    surveys, long-term climate data, and major soils and runoff data.
  2: Uses a revised Ricardian model incorporating hydrological variables to assess
    the economic impact of climate change on agriculture in South Africa. The estimated
    model is then used to predict the range of impacts on the agricultural sector
    under various climate change scenarios. The model examines farm performance across
    different agro-climatic zones, controlling for other factors.
  4: The sample includes 416 farm households from 17 districts across nine provinces,
    incorporating all agro-ecological regions in the country.
  5: Revised Ricardian model estimated using STATA, quantile regression (qreg) used
    to correct for heteroscedasticity; reduced form estimated to address endogeneity
  6: Regression analysis is used to estimate the impact of climate, soil, and hydrology
    variables on crop farming net revenue. Models are estimated for the full sample
    and for different farm types (irrigated, dryland, large-scale, small-scale) for
    South Africa. The time horizon for climate impacts is 2050 and 2100 using selected
    climate scenarios.
  7: The analysis uses estimated models to assess climate variables' impact on crop
    net revenues, comparing irrigated and dryland models, as well as large-scale and
    small-scale farms in South Africa.
  8: Regression analysis using a full sample model to estimate the marginal impacts
    of climate variables at agro-ecological and provincial levels based on their respective
    means. Elasticities are estimated as (Marginal effects / Mean of corresponding
    climate variable) / Mean of dependent variable (crop net revenue).
  9: The study uses synthetic or General Circulation Model (GCM)-based climate change
    scenarios as input to a Water Balance (WatBal) model. Three main scenarios derived
    by Strzepek and McCluskey (2006) using three different models (CSIRO2, HadCM3
    and PCM) in conjunction with the A2 emission scenarios plausible for South Africa
    were used. Consequences of these climate change scenarios on net crop revenues
    in 2050 and 2100 were examined using the estimated model in Appendix A.
  10: Revised Ricardian model that incorporates runoff and irrigation into the analysis
    of climate impacts on crop-farming activities.  Analysis covers agro-ecological
    zones and nine administrative provinces.
  11: Analysis based on three plausible climate scenarios for South Africa; results
    are derived from assessing impacts on agriculture at agro-ecological and provincial
    levels.
  12: Ricardian approach using regression analysis. The analysis uses OLS regressions
    with crop farming net revenue as the dependent variable and climate and soil variables
    as independent variables. The sample periods vary depending on the specification,
    with the number of observations ranging from 91 to 191.
More Notes:
  5: Multicollinearity was controlled for by dropping problematic variables. Obvious
    outliers were excluded. The analysis focuses on South Africa.
  8: The Northern Cape Province experiences a negative mean annual impact from increased
    temperature due to its exceptionally hot climate. Small-scale farms can experience
    negative impacts from increased precipitation due to the relative negative effect
    of the winter farming season outweighing the positive effect in the summer farming
    season.
  10: Irrigated farms are more cushioned against adverse climate effects.  The relationship
    between climate variables and net revenue is non-linear. Soil type affects crop
    yields and how climate affects the crop-farming sector.
  11: Adaptation measures should focus on leveraging irrigation and introducing heat-tolerant
    crop varieties to offset negative impacts.
  12: The analysis is stratified by full sample, irrigated farms, dryland farms, large-scale
    farms, and small-scale farms, providing insights into how climate and soil variables
    affect different farming types. The /C0 likely represents an error in text extraction
