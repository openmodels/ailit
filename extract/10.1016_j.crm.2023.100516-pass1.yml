Drivers of Risk:
  1: Not explicitly stated on this page, but likely includes aspects of physical climate
    like temperature, precipitation, etc.
  2: Changing climate conditions, exposure and vulnerability of human and natural
    systems.
  4: The paper identifies various climatic impact-drivers (CIDs) and hazards relevant
    to each RKR, such as sea level rise, SST warming, permafrost thaw, sea ice decrease,
    ocean acidification, marine heatwaves, storm surges, tropical and extratropical
    cyclones, heat extremes, changes in precipitation, and fire weather conditions.
  6: Changes in precipitation patterns, extreme events like flooding and drought,
    snow cover changes, sea level rise, and warming trends are drivers of risk.
  7: A list of climatic impact-drivers/potential hazards is presented, organized by
    CID type as in Ranasinghe et al. (2021) and Ruane et al. (2022). These CID/Hazards
    are described in the text of Sections 2.1-2.8.
  8: CID/hazards influenced by global surface air temperature (GSAT) warming.
  9: "global average SSTs will increase between 2 \u25E6C and 4 \u25E6C under High\
    \ warming (SSP5-8.5, reaching GWLS between 3.6 \u25E6C and 6.9 \u25E6C); but only\
    \ between 0.4 \u25E6C and 1.5 \u25E6C under Low warming (SSP1-2.6, reaching GWLs\
    \ between 1.3 \u25E6C and 2.8 \u25E6C)"
  10: Heavy precipitation episodes have increased in frequency and intensity over
    the historical record.
  11: Increased global surface air temperature (GSAT) warming drives changes in precipitation
    patterns, soil moisture drying, land-atmosphere feedbacks, and fire weather conditions.
  12: Global surface air temperature (GSAT) warming is a driver impacting Arctic warming,
    sea levels, permafrost, glacier mass, and frequency of climate hazards.
  13: Global warming levels (GWLs), sea level rise, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere
  14: Higher frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts, and compound flooding
    events expected with additional warming.
  15: Regional warming, mean precipitation change, sea surface temperature warming,
    snow cover, permafrost thawing, heat extremes, tropical cyclone intensity, marine
    heatwaves, droughts and fire weather, storm surges (from winds and sea level rise),
    sea level rise, glacier mass loss.

    hazards, and patterns of warming in different regions.

    function of global surface air temperature (GSAT) warming.
  9: 'Extreme heat: On the global scale, the frequency and intensity of heat extremes
    have increased since the 1950s.'
  11: This section covers inland floods, droughts, fire weather, ENSO variability,
    tropical cyclones, and extra-tropical storms and their relationship to global
    warming levels (GWLs).
  12: This page provides an overview of expected climate impacts at various levels
    of global warming.
  13: No relevant information
  15: No relevant information
Highlights:
  2: Offers a representation of the future evolution of the hazard components of RKRs.
  4: The paper highlights the concept of Representative Key Risks (RKRs) as a way
    to categorize climate change impacts. It emphasizes that risks can be compounded
    across different RKR categories, and that the RKRs are not mutually exclusive.
  6: Arctic region warming is projected to continue at a rate between 2 and 2.4 times
    faster than GSAT, and the RKR-H section highlights risks to peace and human mobility.
  7: The table identifies which climatic impact-drivers are relevant to various RKRs.
  8: The table summarizes the expected behavior of climate impact drivers (CID)/hazards
    as a function of GSAT warming. Relationships are categorized as quantitative (pink),
    qualitative (yellow), or no robust relation (blue). Confidence levels from IPCC
    AR6 WGI are included.
  9: Global average SSTs will increase under both high and low warming scenarios.
  10: Heavy precipitation events have increased historically and are expected to continue
    increasing in frequency and intensity with further warming.
  11: Drought severity and frequency are directly related to GSAT warming, with increased
    probabilities of drought conditions at higher warming levels. Rain intensity of
    tropical cyclones has increased.
  12: Key impacts include projected losses in permafrost volume and glacier mass,
    increased frequency of marine heatwaves, and changes in precipitation and drought
    event intensity with rising temperatures.
  13: Even with limited warming, many coastal locations could see historical 100-year
    flood events becoming annual events by 2100. SLR until mid-century will likely
    be between 0.15 and 0.30 m. Marine heatwave frequency has already doubled and
    is projected to increase significantly. Ocean acidification is occurring rapidly,
    with surface pH at its lowest level in at least 26,000 years.
  14: Map shows locations where global warming turns 100-year events into annual ones
    by 2100, based on projected sea level rise.
  15: Many hazards can be put in a direct, strong relationship with global temperature
    changes, although uncertainties remain in the magnitude and rate of change, especially
    when downscaling to regional/local phenomena. Some changes are path-dependent,
    dependent on the mix of forcings, or non-linear (thresholds or time-lags). The
    study reinforces the message that every increment of global warming matters.
Methodology:
  2: Identifies relevant hazards for each RKR based on WGII assessment and reports
    on their current state and expected future changes.
  4: "The paper identifies the CIDs/hazards relevant to the risks becoming severe\
    \ as assessed by O\u2019Neill et al. (2022). The paper focuses on how global warming\
    \ levels increase these risks. The RKRs are derived from sectoral and regional\
    \ chapters of a larger report."
  6: The analysis is based on climate model output, specifically CMIP6, and utilizes
    Global Warming Levels, which are assessed with GSAT.
  7: "Relevance of CID/Hazards to various RKRs (Reasons for Concern) is judged based\
    \ on the WG II authors\u2019 assessment of \u201Ckey\u201D risks."
  8: Analysis based on IPCC AR6 WGI assessment.
  10: Pattern scaling represents scaling of mean precipitation with GSAT, using CMIP6
    projections.
  11: Normalized patterns of surface temperature and precipitation change are computed
    separately for all CMIP6 models/scenarios then averaged.
  12: "The analysis is based on relating future changes to global warming levels (GWLs),\
    \ using quantitative estimates for discrete warming levels from 1.5\xB0C to 5\xB0\
    C."
  13: Projections based on scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5), applicable to the 21st
    century.
  14: Focus on the hazard component of risk, albeit acknowledging exposure, vulnerability,
    and adaptation as factors.
  15: The analysis presents how climate impact drivers/hazards are expected to evolve
    as a function of global warming levels (GWLs), decoupling from specific GSAT trajectories
    where possible, but acknowledging path-dependency for some hazards. The analysis
    adopts a global perspective on changing climatic impact-drivers to serve a synthetic
    assessment based on global warming levels rather than particular scenarios of
    emissions and therefore warming.
More Notes:
  1: This is the first page of the paper, so it mainly contains title, authors, and
    publication information. The HAL ID and link indicate it's an open-access document.
  2: This paper focuses on the hazard components of RKRs, while other papers in the
    special issue treat each of the eight RKRs holistically.
  4: The paper states that its main purpose is to relate climatic impact-drivers/hazard
    changes to increasing global warming levels, a topic not treated in detail in
    related papers. The paper also points out that the vulnerability of coastal populations
    varies depending on the level of development and environmental degradation.
  8: Information presented is continued on the next page.
  11: The analysis emphasizes the link between global warming levels and the severity
    and frequency of extreme weather events.
  13: The paper references figures (Fig. 2a, 2b, 2c, and 3) that are not included,
    which would likely provide more context for the quantitative information.
  14: Catalogue of climate impact-drivers that have potential to become hazards contributing
    to severity of key risks.
  15: The paper emphasizes that the hazard component is only one determinant of climate
    risk, and changes in exposure and vulnerability need to be considered jointly
    with changes in climatic conditions.
