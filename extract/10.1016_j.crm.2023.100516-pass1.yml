Drivers of Risk:
  2: Changing climate conditions (magnitude, intensity, and/or frequency of hazards)
    linked to Global Warming Levels (GWLs), interacting with the exposure and vulnerability
    of human and natural systems.
  5: Hazards that endanger industries and laborers exposed to heat extremes, coastal
    flooding and storms; frequent occurrence of extremes causing physical damages
    or imperiling the growth of crops; shifting climatologies and more frequent and
    intense extremes affecting systems relying on agriculture, fisheries and other
    climate-sensitive activities; extreme heat and precipitation events and droughts;
    increase in overall precipitation variability; changes in expected average precipitation
    and its geographic patterns; water-related hazards (floods and droughts) and induced
    by water quality deterioration.
  15: Patterns of regional warming and mean precipitation change, sea surface temperature
    warming, snow cover, permafrost thawing, heat extremes, tropical cyclone intensity,
    marine heatwaves, droughts and fire weather, storm surges as results of winds
    and sea level rise combined, SLR and glacier mass loss.
Highlights:
  2: The paper provides a representation of the evolution of hazard components of
    RKRs, systematically linking them to Global Warming Levels (GWLs).
  5: Economic impacts can range from GDP to individual livelihoods. Poverty and inequality
    can be exacerbated. Livelihoods depending on agriculture, fisheries, and other
    climate-sensitive sectors are threatened by shifting climatologies and extreme
    events. Risks to food and water security are also key concerns.
  15: Many hazards have a direct, strong relationship with global temperature changes.
    The message that every increment of global warming matters is further substantiated
    and reinforced.
Methodology:
  2: The paper offers a systematic representation of the future evolution of hazard
    components of Representative Key Risks (RKRs). It identifies relevant hazards
    for each RKR based on WGII assessments and reports on their current state and
    expected future changes, linking these changes to GWLs where possible, drawing
    on current literature and assessments.
  5: No relevant information
  15: Analysis is based on global warming levels rather than specific scenarios of
    emissions and warming. Focuses on the relationship between global temperature
    changes and various climate hazards.
More Notes:
  2: This paper is part of a special issue where other papers assess RKRs holistically,
    but the assessment cannot always be organized according to a systematic gradation
    of climatic changes. This paper fills this gap by focusing on the hazard components.
  15: Emphasizes the importance of considering exposure and vulnerability alongside
    climate hazards for a realistic assessment of future risk. The hazard component
    is only one of the determinants of climate risks.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: This page does not directly quantify macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes or costs/benefits
    of adaptation. It focuses on characterizing the hazard components of climate risks.
  5: Risks linked to economic impacts at all scales, from Gross Domestic Product to
    individual livelihoods; poverty within countries as well as inequality across
    countries.

Quantitative material:
  2: The paper aims to link changes in hazards to Global Warming Levels (GWLs), suggesting
    a degree of quantification, but no specific quantitative outcomes (GDP effects,
    fiscal measures, etc.) are presented on this page.
