Drivers of Risk:
  7: 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature; falling water tables; climate change; decline
    in China's grain production.
Highlights:
  7: Climate change is likely to put food security on the front page of newspapers;
    Future food security now depends on the combined efforts of the ministries of
    agriculture, energy, transportation, health and family planning, and water.
More Notes:
  7: The paper highlights the interconnectedness of different sectors and ministries
    in ensuring food security under climate change.

  5: This page is a table of contents and does not contain specific analysis or results
    related to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks of climate change and the costs/benefits
    of adaptation at a national level. It outlines topics related to food, water,
    and climate, but without quantifying economic outcomes.
  6: This page is a preface and does not contain information directly relevant to
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks of climate change, costs/benefits of adaptation,
    or quantitative data. It focuses on challenges in world food security assessment.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  7: Food security; grain production decline.
Quantitative material:
  7: A 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature leads to a decline in wheat, rice, and
    corn yields of 10 percent; China's grain production dropped by 50 million tons
    between 1998 and 2004; China's purchase of 8 million tons of wheat to import in
    2004.
