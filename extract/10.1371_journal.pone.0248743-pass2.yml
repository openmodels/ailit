Drivers of Risk:
  1: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, unemployment
  2: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, unemployment,
    fluctuating oil prices, COVID-19 related recessions
  3: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, and unemployment
    are considered potential drivers of risk impacting economic growth.
  6: Carbon dioxide emissions, rainfall, temperature, population
  7: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, unemployment
  8: Changes in environmental variables like carbon emissions (CO2), rainfall (RF),
    and temperature (TEPT) are investigated as drivers that impact economic growth.
  9: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, population.
  10: Shocks from unemployment, population changes, variations in rainfall and temperature,
    and CO2 emissions.
  11: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, unemployment
  12: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, unemployment,
    exogenous factors, endogenous factors, excessive reliance on cheaper foreign workers,
    long-term unemployment compensation
  13: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature
  14: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, and unemployment
    are drivers affecting economic growth.
  15: Environmental and macroeconomic transformations like carbon emissions, unemployment,
    inflation, rainfall, temperature, and population affect economic growth.
  17: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, unemployment,
    dependence on foreign workforce, geo-political circumstances, technological changes,
    global circumstances, scarcity of fossil fuels, adverse climatic conditions (low
    or high rainfall and temperature), social and political disharmony
  19: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, unemployment
  21: CO2 emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, energy consumption,
    environmental degradation
Highlights:
  1: Unemployment and economic growth are positively cointegrated in the long-run;
    carbon emissions have a negative effect on economic growth; rainfall and temperature
    are cointegrated into economic growth in negative and positive ways respectively;
    the long-term effects of inflation and population on economic growth are positive.
  2: Saudi Arabia can achieve both higher economic growth and lower carbon emissions
    simultaneously even without effectively addressing the unemployment problem. The
    nation should utilize modern scientific technologies to annual rainfall losses
    and to reduce annual temperature in some parts of the country in order to achieve
    higher economic growth.
  3: The study aims to determine the effects of various macroeconomic and environmental
    factors on economic growth in Saudi Arabia, addressing a gap in the existing literature.
  6: The variables are integrated in a mixed order of I(0) and I(1).
  7: The ARDL approach avoids endogeneity, multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity and
    autocorrelation problems. Descriptive statistics show no serious issues with skewness,
    kurtosis, and Jarque-Bera normality test results.
  8: Evidence suggests strong cointegration relationships between variables, indicating
    economic outcomes like GDP growth may be significantly impacted by changes in
    other variables such as carbon emissions and rainfall.
  9: Variables are cointegrated if the computed F-statistic is greater than the upper
    bound critical value.
  10: Significant short-run impacts on GDP growth from unemployment, population, and
    environmental variables including rainfall and CO2 emissions.
  11: Annual rainfall and CO2 emissions have a significant but negative effect on
    GDP growth in Saudi Arabia.
  12: GDP growth of Saudi Arabia is affected by both endogenous and exogenous factors;
    Unemployment and GDP growth can exhibit positive correlation in some countries;
    GDP growth and population growth are significantly and positively cointegrated
    in the long-run for Saudi Arabia; A negative and highly significant ECM-based
    cointegrating equation coefficient implies a long-term relationship exists between
    the dependent variable and the regressors.
  13: The study finds statistically significant short-run relationships between changes
    in macroeconomic variables (inflation, unemployment, temperature, rainfall, and
    carbon emissions) and economic growth. The error correction term confirms the
    existence of a long-run relationship between the variables.
  14: The estimated CUSUM of squares is normally within the 5% level of significance,
    indicating that the residual variance is fairly stable.
  15: The study concludes that Saudi Arabia can achieve higher economic growth without
    addressing unemployment due to reliance on foreign workforce and natural resource
    wealth.
  17: Long-term dependence on foreign workforce and unemployment of Saudi citizens
    may lead to social and political disharmony and economic instability. Reliance
    on petroleum resources as a comparative advantage is unsustainable in the long
    run. Moving to green energy and adapting to variations in rainfall and temperature
    are crucial for long-term economic growth.
  21: Studies investigate the impact of various environmental and economic factors
    on economic growth and related macroeconomic variables across different countries
    and regions.
Methodology:
  1: Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration
  2: Uses open data source Meteorology and Environmental Protection, Saudi Arabia
    open data source (https://www.pme.g ov.sa/ ). Specific searches used by the authors
    include data from 1990-2019 for GDP growth rates, Inflation rates, unemployment
    rates, population, annual rainfall, average temperature, and carbon dioxide (CO2)
    emissions.
  3: The study aims to investigate the long-run relationships among economic growth,
    inflation, unemployment, population, rainfall, and carbon emissions in Saudi Arabia
    using econometric methods, specifically ARDL.
  6: Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing to determine short- and
    long-run relationships. Unit root tests using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), Phillips
    and Perron (PP), and Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin (KPSS) tests. Cobb-Douglas
    function is used with GDPG = f(CO2, RF, TEPT, INF, POPL, UNEMP). Data is collected
    for the period 1990-2019.
  7: ARDL bounds approach to cointegration is used to determine the long-run relationships
    between the variables. The method is deemed suitable due to the mixed order of
    integration of the data series. The time frame is related to Saudi Arabia's GDP.
  8: The analysis employs ARDL bounds testing of cointegration to explore the relationships
    between the variables, selecting optimal lag length using criteria like Akaike
    Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwarz Bayesian Criterion (SC).
  9: Bound F-statistic (bound test for cointegration) is computed to determine the
    existence of long-run cointegrating relationships among the variables.
  10: The analysis is conducted using an ARDL bounds testing approach for short-run
    co-integration, focusing on macroeconomic and environmental variables.
  11: ARDL bounds testing to analyze long-run cointegration relationships, specifically
    focusing on the case of Saudi Arabia.
  12: Observation of raw data; ARDL bounds testing short-run Error Correction Model
    (ECM).
  13: ARDL bounds testing approach used to examine the short-run effects of carbon
    emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, and unemployment on economic
    growth. Model diagnostic tests include Breusch-Godfrey Serial Correlation LM Test,
    Heteroskedasticity Test, ARCH test, Ramsey RESET test, and Jarque-Bera test.
  14: ARDL model stability is assessed using CUSUM and CUSUM of squares tests; if
    the CUSUM line stays within the 5% critical lines, the coefficients are considered
    suitable for future predictions.
  15: Uses impulse response function (IRF) and ARDL bounds testing approach for analyzing
    time-series data and the dynamic effects of shocks on GDP growth in Saudi Arabia
    from 1990 to 2019.
  17: Not explicitly stated, but appears to be a qualitative analysis based on the
    factors affecting economic growth in Saudi Arabia.

    autoregressive distributed lag modeling, bounds testing approaches, various econometric
    techniques.
More Notes:
  1: Data were extracted from the World Bank and General Authority of Meteorology
    and Environmental Protection, Saudi Arabia
  2: The Saudi Arabian government has a strategy to transform the economy from a factor-driven
    to an efficiency-driven nation, Vision 2030, which seeks to diversity the sources
    of income and focus on continuous macroeconomic steadiness so that the economy
    is no longer so reliant on oil exports.
  3: The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the drivers of economic
    growth in Saudi Arabia to inform policy decisions and achieve the goals of Vision
    2030.
  6: The study investigates the effects of Saudi Arabia's environmental and macroeconomic
    transformations on its economic growth.
