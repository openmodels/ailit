  12: No relevant information
Drivers of Risk:
  7: Water scarcity in semi-arid provinces, under-pricing of water.
  13: Increased demands on water resources and environmental degradation due to rapid
    economic growth and urbanization in China.
  17: Decreased precipitation and landscape change due to human activities (with precipitation
    decrease being the main factor) in northern China; Sensitivity of runoffs in the
    Liao, Hai, and Huai river basins to temperature increase and rainfall decrease.
  18: Climate change impacts on water availability, increases in water demand for
    non-agricultural uses, socio-economic development.
  21: Low water use efficiency in China compared to industrialized countries; Under-pricing
    of water leading to waste and discouragement of water-conserving technologies;
    Climate change is implicit as it motivates improving water efficiency.
  25: Excessive water abstraction, pollution, and mismanagement have damaged river
    and lake ecosystems in China, impacting water availability.
  27: Natural water shortage, widespread water pollution, and climate change are stressing
    freshwater resources; increasing water demands from agricultural, industrial,
    and municipal sectors
Highlights:
  7: Rainwater harvesting and improved water use efficiency contribute significantly
    to economic benefits in water-scarce regions in China.
  13: Amendments to China's Water Law in 2002 focused on equitable and sustainable
    water management, emphasizing water rights, river basin management, water efficiency,
    and pollution protection.
  17: "Water resources decreased significantly in northern China, especially in the\
    \ basins of the Yellow, Hai and Liao rivers, while runoff and total water resources\
    \ increased by 5% in southern China between the periods of 1956\u20131979 and\
    \ 1980\u20132000."
  18: The impacts of climate change on water availability for agriculture are small
    compared to the role of socio-economic development.
  25: Environmental restoration can reduce water pollution and lessen the need for
    additional freshwater abstraction.
  27: China's water resources management faces challenges in meeting increasing demands
    due to water shortages, pollution, and climate change; demand management and pollution
    control are crucial for adaptation.
Methodology:
  7: Analysis of current water use and rainwater harvesting practices, potential for
    expansion. Data from 2001 to 2007, particularly focusing on 2004 and 2006.
  17: "Comparison of precipitation, surface water resources, and total water resources\
    \ in major river basins between 1956\u20131979 and 1980\u20132000."
  18: Models integrated with climate change and socio-economic scenarios were used
    to study the potential impacts of climate change and socio-economic development
    on agricultural water availability in China.
  25: No specific methodology is described in this section.
More Notes:
  13: The amended Water Law marked a transition from infrastructure-focused development
    to more comprehensive water resource management.
  17: The vulnerability of the hydrological cycle and water resources system to climate
    change varies among river basins; river basins in humid southern China, such as
    the Yangtze river basin, are less vulnerable to climate change
  18: China has been actively mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change
    on water resources over the past decade, with a focus on supply-side management
    practices like infrastructure development and new water sources, despite their
    high costs and climate change uncertainties.
  25: The failure of traditional water allocation practices to consider ecological
    functions contributes to river drying during drought seasons.
  27: The paper suggests a shift to demand-side management of water resources and
    control/prevention of water pollution.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  7: Economic enhancement/income enhancement related to rainwater harvesting and water
    use efficiency.
  17: No relevant information
  18: Insufficient water for agriculture in China in coming decades.
  21: Discusses potential for substantial water release for agricultural expansion
    and other sectors through marginal savings in irrigation water use.
  25: No relevant information
  27: The current water resources management in China is increasingly difficult to
    meet the increasing water demands from agricultural, industrial, and municipal
    sectors while adequately protecting the natural environment and ecosystems; widespread
    water pollution significantly constraints the further development and sustainability
    of the country; Climate change is expected to further stress freshwater resources
    and widen the gap between the demand for and supply of water.
Quantitative material:
  7: 3 million households in semi-arid provinces use rainwater harvesting, contributing
    8 billion RMB in economic benefits.
  17: Hai river basin experienced a 10% decrease in precipitation, 41% decrease in
    runoff, and 25% decrease in total water resources between 1956-1979 and 1980-2000.
    It was estimated that 75% of the decrease in surface water resources in the basins
    of the Yellow, Huai, Hai and Liao rivers was due to decrease in precipitation.
  21: China's water use per 10,000 Yuan GDP was 329 m3 in 2006; Agriculture has an
    integrated irrigation water use efficiency of 0.38.
  25: Withdrawals accounted for over half of the renewable water resources in most
    basins; for the Hai river basin, abstraction exceeded available resources by 26.2%.
