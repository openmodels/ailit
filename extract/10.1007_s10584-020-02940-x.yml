Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climatic changes
  2: Impacts include ocean warming, deoxygenation, acidification, coastal flooding,
    droughts, rising seas, and extreme weather, affecting physical, chemical, biological,
    and human variables in ocean and coastal ecosystems.
  4: The conceptual model includes climate processes, anthropogenic climate change,
    and other stressors like pollution, over-exploitation, and land-use changes.
  5: Human activities resulting in GHG emissions impact the ocean and coastal environment,
    including ocean temperature rises that drive shifts in marine species' geographic
    ranges.
  6: Changes in sea surface temperature (SST), arctic sea ice extent, ocean chlorophyll
    concentration, and sea level rise.
  9: Increases in atmospheric CO2 cause long-term declines in aragonite saturation
    state in the open ocean, leading to ocean acidification.
  10: Climate change-related temperature increases and ocean acidification are identified
    as primary drivers impacting marine ecosystems.
  12: Sea level rise, fishery species range shifts due to climate change (e.g., increasing
    sea surface temperature, ocean acidification).
  14: Climate change and ocean acidification (coral reefs); coastal water temperatures
    and salinity (Vibrio); environmental conditions (HABs); climate disruption (marine
    mammals); climate change (shorebirds); ocean's bottom temperature (ocean's heat
    storage)
  15: The paper mentions climate change impacts in ocean and coastal ecosystems. It
    also mentions the depth of the ocean's mixed layer, absorption of carbon dioxide,

    in ocean and coastal ecosystems to provide early warnings, reduce impacts, and
    increase resilience.
  4: The paper identifies potential indicators with robust science-based connections
    to climate change, aiming to recognize opportunities to mitigate and adapt to
    changes, thus increasing resilience.
  5: Climate change may necessitate updating fishery management practices and initiating
    mitigation and adaptation activities in response to shifting marine species and
    ecosystem service changes.
  6: Four indicators (SST, arctic sea ice extent, ocean chlorophyll concentration,
    and sea level rise) were selected for inclusion in a pilot National Climate Indicator
    System (NCIS).
  9: Ocean acidification can increase coral bioerosion, change phytoplankton community
    composition, reduce recruitment of calcifying organisms, alter development and
    neurobiology of some fish species, and reorganize ecosystems.
  10: Significant bleaching events can cause long-term damage to coral ecosystems,
    affecting biodiversity and the associated economic benefits.
  12: Communities with high dependence on fishing and high social and/or high gentrification
    pressure vulnerability may be less resilient to the effects of climate change.
    Identifies vulnerable populations that may be less able to withstand and recover
    from climate change and socioeconomic impacts.
  14: "Climate change and ocean acidification will likely reduce the distribution\
    \ and species diversity of most coral reef ecosystems; Vibrio abundance is strongly\
    \ linked to coastal water temperatures and salinity; Harmful algal blooms are\
    \ becoming more prevalent in coastal areas; Marine mammals can serve as effective\
    \ sentinels for ecosystem change and emerging diseases; Shorebird abundance and\
    \ phenology are good integrators of global change; Tracking the temperature of\
    \ the ocean\u2019s bottom is necessary for understanding the ocean\u2019s heat\
    \ storage"
  15: The paper highlights the need for developing a full suite of indicators to track
    climate impacts on ecosystem services and improved synthesis and delivery of indicator
    information into decision-making.

  14: "Data on social and economic indicators related to coral reef health are needed,\
    \ as are methods to link social and economic indicators related to tourism and\
    \ recreation to climate change impacts on coral reefs; A Vibrio indicator would\
    \ have implications for the Clean Water Act\u2019s 'fishable, swimmable' mandate\
    \ and the value of ecosystem services provided by coastal ecosystems; A program\
    \ is needed to evaluate and establish robust, reliable, and systematic methods\
    \ for monitoring changes in the frequency and spatial extent of HABs, and to design\
    \ an indicator from these data"
