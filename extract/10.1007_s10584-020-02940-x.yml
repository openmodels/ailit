Drivers of Risk:
  1: As climatic changes occur, these benefits or ecosystem services may be significantly
    reduced.
  2: Ocean warming, deoxygenation, acidification, coastal flooding, droughts, rising
    seas, extreme weather.
  5: Greenhouse gas emissions leading to warming oceans and subsequent poleward shifts
    in the geographic range of marine fish.
  9: Ocean acidification caused by increases in atmospheric CO2 leading to declines
    in aragonite saturation state.
  11: Climate-related impacts; Sea level rise (SLR); Salt-water intrusion into water
    supplies; Loss of habitat; Loss or relocation of homes, fishing infrastructure,
    or fishing-related businesses; Climate vulnerability of fish species landed; Changes
    in the diversity of species landed; Sea ice coverage (Alaska); Erosion risk (Alaska);
    Permafrost coverage (Alaska); Proximity to transition zones (Alaska).
  13: Climate change altering the abundance and distribution of living marine resources
    harvested in subsistence fisheries.
  14: Climate disruption impacts ocean health.
Highlights:
  1: Ocean and coastal ecosystems provide many important non-market services including
    subsistence food provisioning, health benefits, shoreline protection, climate
    regulation, conservation of marine biodiversity, and preservation of cultural
    heritage, in addition to economic outputs.
  9: Communities where commercial or subsistence fishing depends largely on bivalves
    or crustaceans will be most heavily impacted by ocean acidification. Even smaller
    levels of dependence may be critical to overall economic viability for some fishing
    communities.
  11: Community climate vulnerability includes indicators like sea level rise risk
    for US coastal communities. The availability of some indicators varies geographically
    (nationally, subsets of states, Alaska-specific).
  13: Subsistence fisheries provide food security, cultural value, and revenue, but
    are vulnerable to climate change impacts on marine resources. Data on subsistence
    fishing is lacking from nearly every region.
Methodology:
  5: The study uses a conceptual model to identify key points along the ecosystem
    services pathway impacted by climate change. The NCIS (National Climate Indicators
    System) aims to provide early warning of changes and how they might impact the
    system. The Oceans and Coasts Technical Team developed five core criteria for
    determining which indicators to advance based on their alignment with the conceptual
    model and utility for tracking specific services.
  11: The analysis relies on complex indicators composed of multiple indices, based
    primarily on data from the US Census Bureau and the National Marine Fisheries
    Service (NMFS).
More Notes:
  11: Social vulnerability, gentrification pressure vulnerability, and fishing dependence
    are considered as measures of social well-being.
No relevant information:
  12: This page focuses on social vulnerability and community resilience in coastal
    areas of the US, but does not provide information regarding macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    risks and costs/benefits of adaptation at a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: The U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) generates ~US 370 billion of U.S. gross
    domestic product, 617 billion in sales and 2.6 million jobs each year.
  2: US exclusive economic zone generates ~US$370 billion of GDP, $617 billion in
    sales, and 2.6 million jobs each year from ocean and coastal ecosystems.
  5: The paper discusses potential economic costs associated with shifts in marine
    fish populations due to climate change, impacting commercial, recreational, and
    subsistence fishermen. These include increased time and resources spent traveling
    to harvest fish, switching to new species requiring new equipment, or changing
    professions altogether.
  9: Impacts on the tourism industry (reef diving), commercial fishery production
    (both bivalves and crustaceans), and subsistence use of reef fish, bivalves, and
    crustaceans.
  11: Social well-being of coastal communities, especially in relation to fishing;
    Vulnerability of communities to climate or other impacts; Ability of communities
    to respond to and recover from impacts.
  13: Food security, cultural value, and revenue for local economies and government
    agencies are affected by climate change's impact on subsistence fisheries.
  14: Diseases in marine organisms can signal deteriorating ocean health and increase
    public health risks, impacting the sustainable development of coastal and ocean
    resources.
Quantitative material:
  1: ~US 370 billion of U.S. gross domestic product, 617 billion in sales and 2.6
    million jobs each year are generated by the U.S. EEZ.
  2: Quantitative figures for GDP, sales, and jobs related to US ocean and coastal
    ecosystems.
  11: No quantitative information on macroeconomic outcomes presented.
