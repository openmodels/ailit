Drivers of Risk:
  1: Accelerating climate change, irreversible changes like rising sea levels, increased
    poverty and migration, health risks especially in cities.
  2: Climate change impacts on infrastructure in developing countries; slow progress
    in national adaptation plan (NAP) development and implementation.
  5: Increased vulnerability of Russia's population and economy, particularly infrastructure,
    to climate changes with warming rates in Russia overall almost double and in the
    Arctic region 2.5-3 times higher than the global average.
  6: Climate change, natural hazards, disasters, delaying adaptation investments.
  9: Climate change impacts, specifically air temperature change and permafrost thaw.
  10: Climate change impact
Highlights:
  1: Adaptation is deprioritized in strategic decisions, yet it has high economic
    efficiency and significant benefits for long-term socio-economic development.
  2: The cost of climate change impacts on developing countries' infrastructure is
    significant (1% of GDP); Adaptation efforts are underfunded, with adaptation expenditure
    being 5-10 times less than needed.
  5: Adaptation may become the last-resort 'insurer' against climate-related disasters
    if decarbonization efforts are ineffective.
  6: 'Investments in adaptation are highly profitable due to their multiplicative
    effect (triple dividend): reduced losses, economic gains, and environmental/cultural
    benefits. Early warning systems are particularly effective. Delaying adaptation
    increases costs significantly.'
  9: Permafrost degradation in the Russian Arctic leads to economic damage to buildings,
    infrastructure and healthcare facilities.
  10: Adaptation measures have high economic efficiency, with world average benefits
    surpassing costs four-fold; Adaptation is important for long-term socioeconomic
    development in Russia.
Methodology:
  9: The references suggest economic assessments are being used to evaluate the impacts
    of climate change in the Russian Arctic. Melnikov et al. (2021) uses an approach
    that models impacts of temperature change and permafrost thaw until the mid-21st
    century.
More Notes:
  2: The page emphasizes the importance of adaptation alongside emissions reduction
    and highlights the slow progress and underfunding of adaptation efforts in developing
    countries.
  6: The analysis emphasizes the importance of prioritizing national interests in
    climate policy, focusing on improving quality of life and national security.
  9: There are some references regarding global adaptation and decarbonization (e.g.,
    Hallegatte, Rozenberg, UNEP reports, Global Commission on Adaptation), but most
    of the quantitative information focuses on the Russian Arctic and the economic
    impacts of permafrost thaw. The references mentioning the Paris Agreement and
    Glasgow Climate Pact are more related to global climate governance rather than
    specifically quantifying macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks.
  10: The paper argues that adaptation is often undervalued in climate policy compared
    to decarbonization.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: GDP effects, public expenditure on adaptation.
  5: Adaptation measures can significantly reduce expected damage in developing countries
    by 2-3 times and their protection costs by an order of magnitude, saving at least
    $200 billion annually on average.
  6: 'Macroeconomic: GDP growth, productivity. Fiscal: prevented losses and costs
    from climate change impacts.'
  9: Economic damage to residential/industrial buildings from permafrost thaw in the
    Russian Arctic; Economic effects of permafrost degradation on infrastructure (roads,
    housing, healthcare) in the Russian Arctic; Cost and benefits of adaptation to
    climate change.
  10: Economic efficiency (multiplier effect inclusive) of adaptation measures with
    their world average benefits surpassing costs four-fold; losses and damage from
    climate change impact to maintain sustainable long-term socioeconomic development
Outcomes of Interest:
  1: Economic benefits of adaptation measures are on average four times greater than
    the costs.
Quantitative material:
  1: Projected increase of global poor by 132 million in the next decade and increase
    in migrants by 216 million by 2050; economic damage to businesses and households
    from climate events estimated between $391 billion to $647 billion.
  2: Damage to infrastructure in developing countries is around $250 billion, or about
    1% of their aggregate GDP; Developing countries' expenditure on adaptation in
    2016 was $22 billion; Developing countries' adaptation costs in 2019 were $70
    billion, or less than 0.15% of their aggregate GDP.
  5: Adaptation of vulnerable infrastructure may require an additional 50 billion
    rubles annually.
  6: Global Commission on Adaptation estimates $1.8 trillion annual investment in
    adaptation yields $7.1 trillion in benefits. Investment in early warning systems
    has a benefit-cost ratio of 10:1, coastal vegetation protection 6:1, climate-resilient
    infrastructure and drought-resistant crops 5:1. Delaying investment decisions
    by 10 years doubles adaptation costs in developing countries.
  9: Melnikov et al. (2021) provides an assessment of damage to buildings and infrastructure
    from permafrost thaw in the Russian Arctic by the mid-21st century. Porfiriev
    et al. (2019, 2021, 2021) offers economic assessments of permafrost degradation
    effects on roads, housing, and healthcare infrastructure in the Russian Arctic.
  10: World average benefits of adaptation surpassing costs four-fold
