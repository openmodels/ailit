Drivers of Risk:
  6: The vulnerability maps are based on the WorldRiskIndex and INFORM index, which
    include subcomponents related to susceptibility, lack of coping capacity, lack
    of adaptive capacity, and socioeconomic vulnerability. These indices capture factors
    that contribute to a country's risk profile.
  9: The study focuses on the vulnerability main components of the WRIv and INFORMv
    indices as drivers of risk.
  10: Floods, Storms, and Droughts. Vulnerability (based on WRI and INFORM indices).
  11: Hazard events (floods, droughts, storms), Vulnerability (assessed by WRI and
    INFORM indices)
  12: Vulnerability levels, insurance coverage, wealth and exposed capital assets,
    governance issues, and development deprivation.
  13: Climate threats like sea-level rise, being a Small Island Developing State (SIDS),
    being landlocked.
  15: Increasing number of affected people and economic damages due to natural hazards
    modified by climate change; increase in hazard frequency and intensity.
Example:
  10: Mortality per event is 15 and 7 times higher in countries with very high vulnerability
    compared to countries with very low and low vulnerability, respectively.
Highlights:
  6: Global vulnerability maps based on WorldRiskIndex and INFORM index are presented
    to visualize vulnerability levels across countries.
  9: Higher vulnerability, as measured by the WRIv and INFORMv indices, is associated
    with higher mortality and economic loss per event. The indices have explanatory
    power for disaster outcomes at national and regional levels.
  10: ''
  11: Mortality per event increases with higher vulnerability categories; economic
    losses per hazard event in very high vulnerability countries compared to others
    is analyzed.
  12: High vulnerability countries have greater mortality and population impact, whereas
    low vulnerability countries experience higher economic losses in absolute terms.
  13: Vulnerability rankings of various SIDS differ; SIDS in the Pacific have a higher
    vulnerability compared to those in the Caribbean. Landlocked countries in Africa,
    Southern Asia, and South America have higher average vulnerability compared to
    non-landlocked countries. Vulnerability differs significantly in the Global South,
    particularly in Asia and Africa.
  15: Vulnerability assessments can complement climate information to inform adaptation
    policies.
Methodology:
  6: Internal validation of indices is performed using reliability (Cronbach's alpha
    and Guttmann lambda tests) and sensitivity analyses (global sensitivity analysis).
    External validation is done by comparing aggregated national data to the regional
    level with event, mortality and economic loss data from the EM-DAT database for
    climate-related hazards (storms, droughts, and floods).
  9: Sensitivity analysis is performed on the main components of the WRIv and INFORMv
    indices. Correlation results are used to assess the explanatory power of the indices
    for disaster outcomes.
  10: ''
  11: Clustered boxplots of mortality per hazard event by vulnerability categories
    and type of index system. Bar charts analyze disparities in mortality, economic
    damage, and affected population due to events in very high vulnerability countries
    compared to others using different indices. Kruskal-Wallis tests are used to determine
    statistical significance.
  12: Analysis uses indices like INFORMv and WRIv to categorize countries by vulnerability
    and assess mortality, economic losses, and affected populations per hazard event.
  13: Calculated the average of WRI and INFORM vulnerability components and aggregated
    them to the level of UNSD intermediate and subregions. Analysis of SIDS data and
    vulnerability.
  15: The paper refers to global vulnerability indicators and index approaches.
More Notes:
  6: The study focuses on climate-influenced hazards (storms, droughts, floods), excluding
    other natural hazards like tsunamis and earthquakes.
  9: The sensitivity analysis identifies the most influential components within the
    vulnerability indices. The specific components of vulnerability vary between the
    WRIv and INFORMv indices, suggesting different areas of focus for risk reduction.
  11: 'The vulnerability components of WRI and INFORM are included in the analysis
    and represented with WRIv and INFORMv. [* selected hazards: floods, droughts,
    storms].'
  12: Data availability and quality issues affect the reliability of vulnerability
    indices, impacting the accuracy and applicability of the findings.
  13: The vulnerability scores are based on WRIv and INFORMv indices. The paper notes
    data gaps, particularly for SIDS, and suggests data interpolation and machine
    learning techniques as possible solutions.
  15: The paper highlights the limitations and constraints of global vulnerability
    indicators and index approaches, emphasizing the need to consider local context
    and social diversity; the paper mentions that vulnerability and systemic societal
    vulnerability are more appropriate metrics than absolute economic losses.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  6: No relevant information
  9: Mortality and economic loss per event are considered as outcomes related to vulnerability.
  10: Mortality per climate-related hazard event (floods, storms, and droughts) and
    Economic Losses per climate-related hazard event.
  11: Economic losses per hazard event
  12: Emphasizes higher economic damages per event in low vulnerability/high income
    countries and disproportionate economic losses as a percentage of GDP in low-income
    countries.
  13: No relevant information
  15: The paper discusses mortality due to climatic hazards and economic damages due
    to natural hazards.
Quantitative material:
  6: The vulnerability maps display the values for each country based on the WorldRiskIndex
    and INFORM index.
  10: ''
  11: Magnitude of death per hazard event [number of time higher] and economic losses
    per hazard event [number of times lower] and population affected [number of time
    higher] in the past 10 years in countries categorized as very highly vulnerable
    compared to countries in other vulnerability categories.
  12: Mortality and economic impact statistics are delineated based on vulnerability
    classifications with quantitative comparisons made between highly and low vulnerable
    countries.
  13: The INFORM Index includes all SIDS, however, 37% of the SIDS are in the top
    25% of countries lacking reliable data. Vulnerability values for Haiti (7.0 for
    INFORMv and 0.75 for WRIv), Guinea-Bissau (5.6 for INFORM and 0.71 for WRI), Federated
    States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea and Tuvalu (all between
    5.5 and 5.0 for INFORM), and Comoros, Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste (all between
    0.60 and 0.68 for WRI). Japan (19.89), South Korea (20.84), China (39.6) and North
    Korea (53) vulnerability scores are provided.
  15: The region of Eastern Africa was exposed to over 200 hazard events (droughts,
    floods and storms) and faced more than 100 fatalities per event between 2010 and
    2019; Eastern Asia faced more than 300 hazard events during the same period but
    had a mortality of 15 to 31 fatalities per event.
