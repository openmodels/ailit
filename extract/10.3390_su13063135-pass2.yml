Drivers of Risk:
  2: Natural disasters, climate change, commodity price changes, uncertain donor grants.
  3: Natural disasters (storms, earthquakes, volcanic activity, floods, droughts,
    landslides), climate change, commodity price fluctuations, uncertain donor grants,
    terms-of-trade shocks, commodity price shocks, revenue volatility.
  5: Natural disasters/climate change; External borrowing constraints; Inadequate
    reserves; Permanent shocks (e.g., climate change); Changes in long-term interest
    rates; Changes in fiscal regimes (e.g., new resource projects, fishing agreements)
  6: Increasing frequency and impacts of natural disasters.
  8: Natural disasters (temporary shocks), climate change (permanent shocks)
  9: Debt level (lagged debt-to-GDP ratio)
  10: Debt-to-GDP Ratio, Terms of Trade
  11: Natural disasters, climate change, small economic base, nature of small insular
    economy.
  12: Natural disasters, terms-of-trade shock, resource revenue fluctuations, donor
    grants, real interest rate, real growth rate.
  13: "Natural disasters are implicitly considered as drivers of risk through their\
    \ impact on debt sustainability, as indicated by the factor \U0001D460\U0001D45B\
    \ representing the long-term average impact."
  14: Natural disasters; climate change shocks; commodity price shocks
  15: Unexpected permanent natural disaster shocks or climate change shocks affecting
    economic activity.
  17: Shocks moving the debt/GDP ratio away from target
  18: Volatility in GDP and revenue.
  19: Natural disasters, volatile resource revenue, uncertain grant elements, procyclicality
    of fiscal rules tied to GDP
  20: Natural disasters
  21: Resource revenue volatility; Natural disaster shocks (cost and frequency)
  22: Fluctuations in resource revenue (fishing license fees, logging revenues, mining
    and petroleum taxes) due to resource depletion or market volatility. Climate change
    could impact renewable resources such as fisheries and logging, affecting revenue.
  23: Climate change affecting fishing activity; Reliance on volatile revenue sources
    (fishing license fees, tourism, remittances); Natural disasters
  24: Unexpected massive natural disaster shocks, climate change shocks, commodity
    price fluctuations, foreign aid fluctuations.
  25: Unexpected permanent climate change shocks; Natural disasters; Volatile resource
    revenues; Uncertain foreign grants.
Highlights:
  2: Advantage of a recurrent expenditure rule based on non-resource and non-grant
    revenue, interdependently determined by government debt and budget balance targets
    with expected disaster shocks.
  3: Permanent natural disaster shocks or climate change affect the sustainable, steady-state
    debt-to-GDP ratio.
  5: Investment-friendly fiscal rules are important for Pacific Islands due to infrastructure
    needs amplified by natural disasters/climate change; Expenditure policy is desirable
    to achieve a budget balance rule due to automatic stabilizer effects of revenue;
    Binding external borrowing constraints and inadequate reserves affect fiscal sustainability
    in Pacific Islands
  6: Capping expenditure growth is not suitable for the Pacific Islands due to vulnerability
    to natural disasters.
  8: Distinguishes between temporary (natural disasters) and permanent (climate change)
    shocks and their impact on debt. Proposes expenditure rules and their relationship
    with revenue structure and disaster funds.
  9: "There is a nonlinear relationship between the primary balance and debt-to-GDP\
    \ ratio, suggesting that fiscal authorities respond nonlinearly to debt levels.\
    \ Multiple equilibria can emerge to determine the debt level. There is a debt\
    \ limit (d\u0305). There may be a point of debt-to-GDP ratio that improves the\
    \ primary deficit."
  10: The primary balance is maximized at a 28 percent debt-to-GDP ratio in the Pacific
    Islands.
  11: Small insular economies are vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change.
    The debt-growth nexus is analyzed for Pacific Islands.
  12: Natural disasters and other shocks impact the budget balance (spending minus
    revenue) which affects debt dynamics.
  13: Maintaining a government debt level below steady-state ensures sustainability;
    concessional vs. commercial debt impacts sustainability.
  14: The effect of disasters on economic growth and the risk premium is ambiguous;
    the results of the steady-state analysis are sensitive to parameters and it is
    not easy to know true steady-state values, thus the exercise presented in this
    paper should be treated as an illustration rather than true values for PNG.
  15: Natural disasters can trigger positive or negative long-term economic effects,
    affecting debt levels and reconstruction capacity, especially in low-income countries.
  17: The paper presents a fiscal adjustment rule to manage the budget balance in
    response to shocks affecting the debt/GDP ratio. It also highlights the importance
    of expenditure rules over revenue rules for reducing procyclicality.
  18: GDP is more volatile than revenue in most Pacific Island Countries, including
    PNG. An expenditure rule related to non-volatile revenue has advantages in terms
    of volatility, cyclical stability, operational simplicity, and ease of understanding
    for PNG.
  19: Expenditure rules defined as a percentage of stable revenue (non-resource, non-grant
    revenue) are preferable to those based on GDP due to faster availability of revenue
    data, reduced volatility from natural disasters, and a more direct link between
    expenditure and revenue; Expenditure ceilings on specific spending categories
    can provide clear operational guidance.
  20: Recurrent spending rules are more robust than personnel emolument rules for
    Pacific Island countries. Investment-friendly expenditure rules are useful for
    stabilization purposes.
  21: The paper's fiscal rule allows for deviation from the non-resource, non-recurrent
    budget balance target if natural disaster costs are higher or resource revenue
    is lower than expected.
  22: For commodity exporters (PNG, Timor-Leste), a fiscal target of the non-resource
    primary balance as a percentage of non-resource GDP can smooth resource earnings
    and promote intergenerational equity. Excluding volatile resource revenue from
    fiscal rules is important to avoid procyclicality. Countries relying on fishing
    and logging industries face risks if they increase recurrent spending when revenue
    from those resources is high.
  23: Small island economies are particularly vulnerable due to reliance on volatile
    revenue sources; Stabilization funds and cash buffers are necessary to meet cash
    outflows and build reserves for emergency relief; Escape clauses may help budget
    execution in the presence of shocks.
  24: Fiscal authorities should provide the future fiscal path to explain how fiscal
    targets will be met over the medium term if unexpected natural disasters trigger
    the escape clause.
  25: A recurrent expenditure rule may be the most useful fiscal rule in the Pacific
    Islands as a countercyclical policy tool to handle natural disasters, volatile
    resource revenues, and uncertain foreign grants, together with the debt target,
    which is linked to the budget balance target.
Methodology:
  2: Study of how natural disasters and climate change affect long-term debt dynamics;
    proposition of fiscal policy rules.
  3: Analytical framework for a rule-based fiscal policy to ensure fiscal sustainability
    and economic stability in countries most prone to natural disasters, with a focus
    on Pacific Islands.
  5: Discussion of fiscal rules (debt, budget balance, expenditure, revenue) and their
    pros and cons; Association of balanced budget rule introduction with debt-to-GDP
    ratios and sovereign debt crisis probability
  6: Analysis of customized fiscal rules for Pacific Islands, applicable to other
    small states.
  8: Analysis of five fiscal rules and targets (debt, budget balance, expenditure,
    revenue, and cash buffer) against natural disasters, using both empirical and
    normative approaches for debt targets. Uses Papua New Guinea (PNG) as an example
    of a Pacific Island country.
  9: Country panel data regression using a fiscal reaction function (equation 1) with
    lagged debt and lagged debt squared as independent variables to explain the primary
    balance. Data from Pacific Island countries (Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands,
    Micronesia, PNG, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu) from 1990
    to 2018.
  10: Estimation of a fiscal reaction function, including lagged dependent variable
    as a regressor. Robustness checks are performed by including a commodity terms
    of trade index as an independent variable.
  11: Examines public debt dynamics using a government's cash-flow constraint equation
    and visualizes the debt-growth nexus using a scatter plot of actual data on Pacific
    countries against an estimated nonlinear fiscal reaction function.
  12: Dynamic macroeconomic modelling focusing on government budget constraints and
    debt dynamics. The results are applicable in contexts where the real interest
    rate is higher than the growth rate.
  13: The analysis involves calculating steady-state values and considering the effects
    of natural disasters on debt sustainability.
  14: Steady-state analysis; analysis of permanent natural disasters or climate change
    shocks on debt dynamics
  15: Analysis of permanent shifts in natural disaster probability and their macroeconomic
    impact using hypothetical scenarios.
  17: "The paper uses a fiscal adjustment rule (equation 10) to achieve a target budget\
    \ balance over a period of \U0001D706 years. The adjustment is a simple linear\
    \ rule, but the paper notes that nonlinear rules are also possible."
  18: The analysis calculates the volatility of GDP, revenue, and expenditure levels
    using standard deviations and ratios. It then examines the implications for expenditure
    rules. Results are applicable to Pacific Island Countries, particularly PNG.
  19: Compares expenditure rules based on GDP vs. revenue; Analyzes the impact of
    natural disasters on GDP and revenue; Suggests expenditure ceilings on certain
    categories.
  20: The analysis uses government cash-flow constraints and expenditure rules to
    model the impact of natural disasters on the budget. It assumes a steady-state
    budget balance before a disaster occurs.
  21: Development of a natural disaster-resilient fiscal rule using equations (6),
    (9), and (14) which accounts for recurrent expenditure

    Countries. Analysis of revenue structures to inform fiscal rules and appropriation
    strategies. Assessing the impact of volatile resource revenues.
  23: Discussion of fiscal rules, stabilization funds, and cash buffers as tools for
    managing macroeconomic and fiscal risks; consideration of country-specific economic
    structures; consideration of minimum revenue requirements.
  24: Proposes a fiscal policy framework that includes the expected impact of shocks
    on fiscal balances, forward-looking explanation mechanism similar to inflation
    targeting regimes in monetary policy.
  25: Theoretical framework to determine appropriate debt target based on country
    parameters affected by climate change; Analysis of fiscal rules based on permanent
    income hypothesis; Practical application of fiscal rule framework demonstrated
    using PNG as an example.
More Notes:
  2: The proposed fiscal policy framework is applicable for developing countries facing
    increasing frequency and impact of devastating natural hazards and climatic change.
  3: The paper proposes a recurrent expenditure rule interdependently determined by
    government debt and budget balance targets, incorporating probabilistic disaster
    shocks and robust to natural disasters, commodity price fluctuations, and uncertain
    grant revenues.
  6: Existing literature on fiscal rules does not incorporate natural disasters or
    climate change. Natural disaster funds may be insufficient for Pacific Islands.
  8: The analysis focuses on how fiscal rules and targets can be used to manage the
    fiscal risks associated with natural disasters and climate change in Pacific Island
    countries.
  9: Interest payments are assumed to increase nonlinearly as the debt level goes
    up.
  10: The relationship between the public debt-to-GDP ratio and primary balance is
    slightly nonlinear. The estimated primary balance maximizing debt-to-GDP ratio
    is slightly lower than the 30 percent in the Pacific island countries, which lies
    at the lower bound of the case for other emerging market economies
  11: The figure's source is the IMF World Economic Outlook Database, October 2019.
  12: The framework is applicable to natural disasters and terms-of-trade shocks.
    The model distinguishes between resource and non-resource revenues, which is relevant
    for Pacific Island countries and commodity exporters. Donor grants are considered
    an important source of budget funding.
  14: "Parameters are chosen to be consistent with the IMF\u2019s debt sustainability\
    \ analysis and macro framework at the end of the projection period."
  15: Government policy on disaster cost coverage plays a role in overall economic
    impact.
  17: The presented values for PNG are illustrations, not recommendations. The steady-state
    nominal growth rate excludes the impact of the construction of a massive LNG facility.
    Automatic stabilizer effects are mentioned concerning taxation.
  18: The expenditure rule example provided uses GDP as a percentage, but it is suggested
    to use non-volatile revenue instead because it is less volatile.
  19: The analysis focuses on Pacific Island economies and their specific vulnerabilities;
    The paper recommends using non-resource, non-grant revenue as a base for fiscal
    rules to avoid volatility and uncertainty.
  20: Foreign aid for disaster relief may have time lags and may not enter the budget.
    Public financial management systems need strengthening to implement expenditure
    controls.
  21: The calibrated amount of 320 million Kina for public investment or emergency
    relief is close to the actual 450 million Kina emergency relief approved by the
    PNG government, although other budget items are precluded in the analysis.
  22: The paper highlights the vulnerability of Pacific Island Countries to volatile
    resource revenues and the need for fiscal rules that account for this volatility,
    especially for countries relying on renewable resources such as fishing and logging.
  23: Discusses challenges in achieving fiscal targets due to the increased frequency
    of natural disasters; cash buffer rule is not calibrated nor aligned with other
    fiscal anchors.
  24: The Pacific island countries are used as an example to discuss fiscal rules
    for small islands vulnerable to natural disasters, climate change and commodity
    price fluctuations as well as foreign aid.
  25: The study suggests applying similar analytical methods to other Pacific, Caribbean,
    or Indian Ocean countries.

    Countries including PNG, Fiji, Timor-Leste, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Samoa, Tonga,
    Micronesia, Palau, Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu. PNG revenue-to-GDP
    target ratio of 14.8% from Medium Term Fiscal Strategy 2018-22; nominal GDP growth
    of 5%; implied expenditure-to-GDP ratio of 16.2% based on deficit.
  19: Expenditure ceiling to cap personnel emolument costs below 40 percent of non-resource,
    non-grant revenue.
  20: Equations (11), (12), (13), and (14) provide quantitative relationships between
    recurrent spending, revenues, budget balance, and disaster-related costs.
  21: Illustrative calculation for PNG 2018 earthquake suggesting a 0.4 percent of
    GDP fiscal stimulus at the margin. Calibrated budget balance target is -1.4 percent
    of GDP. Earthquake impact assumed at 3 percent of GDP, with the government covering
    half the economic loss. Resulting non-resource, non-recurrent budget balance needs
    to be smaller than -0.4 percent of GDP, equivalent to 320 million Kina for public
    investment or emergency relief.
  22: Calibration for PNG indicates that the non-resource primary balance should be
    close to zero (-0.3 percent of non-resource GDP) to be consistent with the permanent
    income hypothesis.
  23: Cash buffer rule requires holding cash deposits equivalent to three months of
    recurrent spending.
