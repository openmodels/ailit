Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate physical risk
  2: Chronic and acute climate physical risks (hurricanes); neglecting asset-level
    information; neglecting tail acute risks
  3: Acute climate risks (tropical cyclones) and chronic climate risks (unspecified,
    modelled with point estimates of losses from a macroeconomic model), both conditional
    on IPCC climate scenarios (RCPs and SSPs).
  4: Tropical cyclones impacts in Mexico, shocks by SSP-RCP scenario combination (2-6.0,
    3-2.6, 3-4.5, 5-4.5).
  8: Physical risks from climate change, specifically tropical cyclones, assessed
    using different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios.
  9: Tropical cyclones (hurricanes) with changes in frequencies and intensities due
    to climate change (using RCP2.6, 4.5, and 6.0 scenarios).
  10: Physical risks from climate change, specifically chronic risks impacting output
    trajectories and acute risks impacting assets (tropical cyclones).
  11: Tropical cyclones (acute physical risk) and chronic physical risks.
Highlights:
  1: Asset-level assessment of climate physical risk matters for adaptation finance
  2: Neglecting asset-level and acute dimensions of physical risks leads to large
    errors in the identification of adaptation policy responses, investments and finance
    tools aimed to build resilience to climate change.
  3: Using firm headquarters location as a proxy for asset location significantly
    underestimates climate-related losses. Neglecting the acute risk component leads
    to significant underestimation of financial losses. The model provides a scenario-contingent
    financial valuation of firms that accounts for both historical information and
    future climate scenarios.
  4: "Substantial underestimation of investors\u2019 losses from neglecting tail acute\
    \ risks, tail acute risks lead to large economic losses for firms."
  8: The underestimation of portfolio losses is significant when using proxy data
    instead of asset-level data, suggesting the importance of granular data for accurate
    risk assessment.
  9: Quantifies macroeconomic impacts of climate change in Mexico, particularly from
    tropical cyclones, using the ICES model and assesses the impact on GDP and sectoral
    outputs using different SSP-RCP scenarios. Climate risk adjustments on equity
    valuation are quantified using the CDDM.
  10: Climate change physical risks are not accounted for in current valuations and
    will impact the long-run part of the valuation. The analysis provides a framework
    for adjusting equity valuations to incorporate these risks. The results are considered
    conservative due to data limitations and the consideration of only tropical cyclones.
  11: Equity value computed using EAI represents an average equity value from the
    distribution of possible values considering physical risks. Equity value computed
    using RP250 represents a percentile, or a VaR, of the distribution of possible
    equity values considering physical risks.
Methodology:
  1: Asset-level assessment
  2: Methodology that quantifies physical risks on geolocalized productive assets,
    considering their exposure to chronic and acute impacts (hurricanes) across the
    scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, then translates asset-level
    shocks into economic and financial losses; applied to Mexico.
  3: 'A five-step methodology is used, including: (1) a database model for asset-level
    and business lines data, ownership chain, and financial information; (2) probabilistic
    climate acute risk assessment at the asset level using CLIMADA; (3) connecting
    acute impacts with sector-level chronic impacts on firms'' business lines using
    an Intertemporal Computable Equilibrium System (ICES) model; (4) connecting asset-level
    impacts with firm performance and translating them into an adjustment of the financial
    valuation of the securities (equity) issued by the firm using a Climate Dividend
    Discount Model (CDDM); (5) translating climate physical risks into financial risk
    metrics for the investor.'
  4: Asset-level probabilistic risk assessment for tropical cyclones, sector-based
    and macroeconomic impacts using the Intertemporal Computable Equilibrium System
    (ICES) macroeconomic model, 3-stages Climate Dividend Discount Model (CDDM) for
    climate-adjusted stock valuation, bootstrapping over 15,000 samples.
  8: A database model is developed to connect extra-financial, climate, and financial
    information of individual physical assets and firms. A probabilistic risk assessment
    approach is used to assess asset-level and firm-level losses from tropical cyclones,
    using the CLIMADA model.
  9: Uses historical tropical cyclone data (1950-2021) from IBTrACS, simulates synthetic
    tracks, maps tracks to centroids in Mexico, applies a damage function based on
    wind speed, and uses the ICES model to quantify macroeconomic impacts. The Climate
    Dividend Discount Model (CDDM) is used to quantify climate physical risk adjustments
    on equity valuation.
  10: A dividend discount model is used to value equity. The model incorporates climate
    change impacts on the long-run growth rate of dividends. It considers both chronic
    and acute physical risks and uses firm- and business line-specific data. The analysis
    is performed for individual firms and considers multiple stages in the dividend
    estimation process.
  11: A climate-adjusted dividend discount model (CDDM) is used to assess the impact
    of climate risks on firm equity value, considering scenarios SSP2-RCP6.0, SSP3-RCP2.6,
    SSP3-RCP4.5, and SSP5-RCP4.5. The model considers climate impacts from 2035 onward,
    with a reference year of 2040. Asset-level data is used where available; otherwise,
    proxy data based on a single location per firm is used.

  2: "The assessment of climate physical risks plays a key role to inform decision-makers\
    \ and build resilience to climate change. Commercial methodologies for assessing\
    \ climate risks are often proprietary, not fully transparent/replicable, and can\
    \ lead to diverging results. Adaptation finance has increased from 30 billion\
    \ (annual) USD to 46 billion in the period 2017\u2013 2020, but it still falls\
    \ short of needs, estimated to amount to 250 billion USD per year for low-income\
    \ and emerging countries alone by 2030."
  3: The study focuses on firms in Mexico and their exposure to tropical cyclones.
    The assessment considers both Expected Annual Impacts (EAI) and tail risk, measured
    by return periods (RP100, RP250). The impact of acute and chronic shocks on equity
    value is shown.
  4: "The paper analyzes the impact of climate (chronic + acute) impacts on firms\u2019\
    \ long-run growth rate and adjusts the financial valuation for equity contracts\
    \ of the firm that owns the plants."
  8: The analysis focuses on energy-related and energy-intensive assets and links
    physical assets to business lines and firm equity valuation.
  9: The analysis focuses on Mexico and uses a damage function calibrated specifically
    for Mexico. The study uses the ICES model with assumptions of high climate change
    impacts and high capital mobility and considers time horizons of 2035, 2040, 2045,
    and 2050.
  10: The discount rate is assumed to be constant for all firms and periods. The paper
    focuses on the impact of tropical cyclones. Firms are not assumed to benefit from
    physical assets less exposed to climate physical risk.
  11: The paper acknowledges uncertainty regarding the effects of climate change on
    the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones for the middle of the century,
    but does not explicitly quantify this uncertainty in their confidence intervals.
    The macroeconomic model ICES represents the impacts of climate change either as
    changes in productivity or as losses on physical capital and land.

    in 2040. EAI (asset-level, mean): -0.085% (-0.16%, -0.049%); RP250 (asset-level,
    VaR): -3.3% (-4.9%, -2.2%); Chronic + EAI (asset-level, mean): -0.84% (-1.09%,
    -0.66%); Chronic + RP250 (asset-level, VaR): -3.9% (-5.5%, -2.8%). Also, underestimation
    ranges when using proxy data vs. asset-level data are provided.'
  9: Expected Annual Impacts (EAI) and 250 years Return Period (RP250) are used to
    measure damages.
  10: Equations are provided to calculate the adjusted long-run growth rate (~gL,I,j)

    (r), long-run growth rate (gL), business line output trajectories, asset values,
    residual asset life, and climate impact.
  11: The analysis uses the 99.6th quantile (RP250) to represent Value at Risk and
    the expected annual impact (EAI) to represent average equity value from possible
    values considering physical risks.
