Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change affects rural U.S. communities differently across regions due
    to factors such as demography, occupations, and dependency on government funds.
  5: Climate change, adverse climatic impacts on agriculture, lower shares of highly
    skilled jobs in rural areas, lower returns to college degrees in rural labor markets.
  11: Expansion of invasive weed species northward and earlier plant blooming due
    to warming.
  12: Increased temperatures and precipitation due to climate change.
  15: Warmer summer temperatures, reduced rainfall, and climate change-induced warming
    leading to increased wildfire risk, insect disturbances, invasive species, and
    habitat changes.
  16: Continued population growth in arid and semi-arid regions stressing water supplies.
  19: Changes in availability or access to climate-sensitive resources at local, regional
    or national levels.
Highlights:
  1: Rural U.S. population is more vulnerable to climate change than urban counterparts,
    with varied impacts across regions and sectors.
  5: Rural communities are expected to disproportionately experience the adverse climatic
    impacts on agriculture. Rural counties tend to be poorer than their urban counterparts,
    and the urban rural income gap has been widening.
  11: Projections indicate increased production costs for farmers, including higher
    costs for weed control and livestock maintenance.
  12: No relevant information
  15: Climate change impacts leading to increased wildfire risk, insect disturbances,
    and economic impacts such as reduced forest productivity and increased costs for
    fire suppression.
  16: Rural communities in the Southwest engaged in farming are expected to experience
    additional water stress due to climate change.
  19: Ecosystem service markets and regional-level planning strategies may provide
    avenues for improving understanding and addressing policy needs. Cellulosic based
    energy sources may have benefit rural areas in term of rural job creation, and
    improving rural economy and quality of life.
Methodology:
  1: An extensive review of current knowledge to assess vulnerability of rural U.S.
    communities to climate change based on IPCC scenarios.
  12: No relevant information
  19: Regional case study approach at different spatial scales (national, regional
    and local) to render stakeholder involvement a more productive component in the
    assessment process.
More Notes:
  5: The Southeast rural regions stand out as being plagued by high unemployment,
    suggesting lower coping capacities to the adverse impacts of climate change. The
    specific agricultural impacts will vary geographically.
  12: The document focuses on the impacts of climate change on agriculture and recreation/tourism
    in the US, but without providing original quantitative results or methodological
    descriptions.
  19: Monetizing environmental stewardship contributions made by rural communities
    could result in increased investment in rural areas. Increased use of renewable
    energy sources could potentially mitigate climate change impacts while lessening
    the vulnerability of rural communities.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  5: Adverse climatic impacts on agriculture, rural earnings levels, unemployment.
  12: No relevant information
  15: Annual losses from Southern pine beetle outbreaks have reached over 1% of gross
    state product in certain regions.
  16: Loss of employment in rural communities due to a contracting forest industry.
  19: Rural job creation, improved rural economy and quality of life, increased investment
    in rural areas.
Quantitative material:
  5: Per capita income in urban areas ($32,077), micropolitans ($23,338), and non-core
    counties ($21,005). Between 1993 and 2004, rural areas averaged 0.5% annual growth
    in real earnings compared to 1.2% per year in urban areas.
  11: U.S. weed control costs more than $11 billion annually, with probable increases
    due to climate change.
  12: No relevant information
  15: Increased fire suppression costs in Washington predicted to rise over 50% by
    2020 and over 100% by 2040; Southern pine beetle outbreaks result in average annual
    losses over 1% of gross state product.
