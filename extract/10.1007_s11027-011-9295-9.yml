Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on rural communities across regions and economic sectors,
    including water stress and increased energy costs.
  2: Climate change, including changes in mean and variability of climate properties
    (temperature increase, sea level rise), attributable to anthropogenic activities.
  4: Future projections of three GCM scenarios; changes in population, rate of policy
    adoptions for climate ameliorations, economic growth, and technological growth.
  5: Climatic impacts on agriculture; Specific impacts will vary geographically
  6: Climate-related risk
  8: Climate change altering or shifting job opportunities in recreation; winter recreation
    reduction; summer recreation increase.
  9: The paper identifies climate change events like heat waves, floods, cyclones,
    storm-surges, droughts, air pollutants, and aeroallergens as risks impacting health
    outcomes.
  13: The outcomes are influenced by rising temperatures, decreased snowpack, sea
    level rise, and increased storm severity.
  14: Climate change impacts the distribution and types of forests in the U.S., increasing
    wildfire risk and the chance of pest attacks and diseases.
  16: Increased disturbance, warmer winters, sporadic freezing and thawing, higher
    summer temperatures, earlier spring snowmelt, altered harvesting frequency, changes
    in precipitation intensity and runoff, limitations imposed on water supply by
    projected temperature increases, reductions in rain and snowfall in the spring
    months.
  17: Climate change is increasing temperature, altering marine ecosystems, and changing
    ocean temperatures.
  18: Climate change.
  19: Climate change will affect rural communities through changes in the availability
    or access to climate-sensitive resources.
  20: Bio-physical changes accompanying climate change, increase in adverse weather
    events.

Highlights:
  1: Rural U.S. population is more vulnerable to climate change than urban counterparts;
    climate change impacts differ across regions and economic sectors; geography and
    vulnerability of rural communities impact climate change tradeoffs; local and
    regional studies are needed to discern climate impacts on rural U.S.
  2: The study highlights the scarcity of information delineating climate change impacts
    specifically on rural communities in the U.S. and calls for increased understanding
    of how social and economic systems could be affected by climate change in the
    context of other stresses.
  4: Rural communities differ from urban counterparts in demography, occupations,
    earnings, literacy, poverty incidence, and dependency on government funds, shaping
    economic and socio-cultural conditions and leading to different vulnerabilities
    to climate change.
  5: Rural communities are expected to disproportionately experience adverse climatic
    impacts on agriculture; The Midwest and Great Plains regions should experience
    larger agricultural impacts compared to other regions; Rural counties tend to
    be poorer than their urban counterparts, suggesting lower coping capacities to
    the adverse impacts of climate change
  7: The South shows a significant disparity, with higher poverty rates in nonmetro
    areas compared to metro areas.
  8: Climate change impacts on recreation will disproportionately affect rural communities
    due to their reliance on recreation-related jobs; there will be regional winners
    and losers in tourism.
  9: The paper highlights that rural areas may be less vulnerable to extreme heat
    due to less built-up areas and more vegetation but may face increased waterborne
    and vector-borne diseases.
  13: Shortening of ski and snowmobile seasons, increase in national park visits,
    exacerbated coastal impacts, and trout habitat loss due to climate change.
  14: Key outcomes include shifts in forest habitats with potential expansions of
    oak/hickory and oak/pine in the East and Ponderosa pine and arid woodland in the
    West.
  16: Climate change could lead to larger timber inventories in the absence of dramatic
    increases in disturbance. Increased harvests tend to lower prices and reduce harvests
    in higher production cost regions. Warmer winters are likely to increase erosion
    and landslides and reduce access for winter harvesting. A contracting forest industry
    would lead to job losses in rural communities. Wildfire risk is expected to be
    most severe in the Southwest and Northwest. Increased incidences of pest attacks
    and tree diseases could be felt by rural communities across the U.S. Northern
    areas are likely to get wetter and southern areas drier. Climate change could
    result in increasing incidences of droughts, changing precipitation intensity
    and runoff, lower availability of water for irrigation, changing water demands,
    and lower water availability for energy production in some regions, particularly
    the Southwest. The number of dry days between precipitation events is also projected
    to increase in the Southwest and the Mountain West. The eastern part of the country
    will experience increased runoff, accompanied by declines in the West, especially
    the Southwest. Rural communities in the Southwest and engaged in activities like
    farming are expected to experience additional water stress due to climate change.
  17: Rural communities' access to traditional energy sources could be threatened
    by climate change. Fisheries are at risk, impacting livelihoods in rural communities
    and among indigenous peoples. In Alaska, climate change is causing alterations
    in marine ecosystems, restricting fisheries. Lobster fisheries in the Northeast
    are projected to shift northward, and cod fisheries are likely to diminish.
  18: Changes in fish availability due to climate change may hit Guam and American
    Samoa particularly hard.
  19: The paper highlights the need for increased renewable energy adoption and stakeholder
    involvement as strategies to mitigate climate change impacts on rural areas.
  20: Rural communities are more vulnerable to climate change due to fewer resources
    and alternatives compared to urban areas; there is a lack of information on how
    socio-economic and demographic factors will react to climate change and how interconnected
    socio-economic/ecological systems will respond; current literature offers only
    very general guidance for investment and policy-making.
Methodology:
  1: Extensive review of current knowledge to make inferences about rural communities'
    vulnerability based on IPCC scenarios.
  2: The paper represents a compilation of climate impacts faced by rural communities
    in different U.S. geographic regions through a review of current knowledge.
  3: Inferences are drawn only when climate variable trends are consistent across
    all three emission scenarios.
  4: Follows the OMB definition of rural areas (counties not core counties or economically
    tied to core counties).
  6: The analysis uses existing datasets from the USDA ERS (Economic Research Service)
    from various years (2010d, 2010i, 2010k, 2001, 2003), along with existing findings
    from other studies (Miller and Rowley 2002, Yohe and Tol 2002, Turner et al. 2003,
    Whitener and Parker 2007).
More Notes:
  1: Focuses on the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of rural communities in the
    U.S.
  2: The paper aims to bridge the knowledge gap and make inferences about rural communities'
    vulnerability to climate change, and explores policy prescriptions for mitigating
    climate risk and improving adaptation capacities.
  4: Vulnerability is defined as the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and
    unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability
    and extremes.
  5: Rural regions in the Southeast stand out as being plagued by high unemployment
  6: The paper highlights the vulnerability of rural communities to climate change
    due to factors like lower educational attainment, fewer skilled jobs, higher poverty
    rates, dependence on government transfer payments, and a large proportion of outdoor
    recreation areas being in rural counties.
  8: The page focuses on the vulnerability of rural communities due to their demographic
    composition (older and younger populations), less effective emergency response
    systems, and higher healthcare costs.
  18: The paper emphasizes the importance of inter-sectoral linkages, regional climate
    analysis, and research-policy connections for understanding and addressing climate
    change impacts in rural communities. It also calls for more socio-cultural and
    economic data collection to better understand rural communities' damage costs
    and adaptive capacity.
  20: Highlights the need for adaptation and mitigation policies, regional studies,
    and interdisciplinary research.
