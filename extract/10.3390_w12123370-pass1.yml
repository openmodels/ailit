Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes to the stages and characteristics of severe droughts in the Canadian
    Prairies due to climate change, specifically changes in onset, growth, persistence,
    retreat, and duration.
  8: Severe historical droughts on the Canadian Prairies between 1900-2014, as measured
    by the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI).
  9: Projected changes in drought frequency and characteristics (growth, persistence,
    retreat, duration, severity, intensity) in the Canadian Prairies under different
    RCP emission pathways (2.6, 4.5, 8.5).
  14: Changes to Canadian Prairie severe droughts, specifically increased frequency,
    persistence, severity, and intensity, influenced by emission scenarios (RCP 2.6,
    RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.6), slight reduction in summer precipitation and enhanced year-round
    warming.
Highlights:
  1: Severe drought occurrence is projected to increase, particularly toward the end
    of this century with a high emissions scenario; the overall duration and intensity
    of future severe drought conditions is projected to increase mainly due to longer
    persistence stages, while growth and retreat stages are generally shorter.
  8: Severe droughts on the Canadian Prairies exhibit distinct stages (growth, persistence,
    retreat). The 1917-1920 drought serves as a detailed example, characterized by
    a 32-month duration, an average SPEI of -1.42, and a peak where 81% of the area
    was in severe drought.
  9: GCMs generally underestimate observed historical drought frequency. Future severe
    drought frequency is projected to increase, particularly under higher emission
    scenarios (RCP8.5), though there is considerable variability among models. The
    growth stage of droughts may be shorter in the future, potentially leading to
    more 'flash droughts'.
  14: Severe droughts in the Canadian Prairies are projected to increase in frequency,
    persistence, severity, and intensity, particularly under higher emission scenarios,
    leading to increased challenges for adaptation, especially in agriculture and
    water resource management.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of historical and projected future changes to severe drought occurrence
    across the agricultural region of the Canadian Prairies using the Standardized
    Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index and 29 global climate models (GCMs) with
    three representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for the period 1900-2014 and
    future projections.
  8: 'Statistical analysis of historical drought events (1900-2014) on the Canadian
    Prairies, characterized by SPEI. The analysis identifies and quantifies drought
    stages: onset, growth, persistence, peak, retreat, and termination. The data is
    visualized using box plots and bar charts.'
  9: Analysis of 29 GCM projections under different RCP emission pathways to estimate
    future drought frequency and characteristics. Comparison of model projections
    with observed drought data (CANGRD) to assess model performance.
  14: Applied a novel drought stages technique using the SPEI to examine past (1900-2014)
    and future occurrences of severe drought over the agricultural region of the Canadian
    Prairies using 29 CMIP5 GCMs under RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.6. Focused on the
    12-month agricultural growing season.
More Notes:
  1: The study aims to increase understanding of potential future changes to drought
    stages and associated characteristics to aid in developing future adaptation strategies.
  8: The analysis focuses on the temporal and spatial characteristics of drought,
    not explicitly on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. It uses the SPEI as a primary
    indicator of drought severity.
  9: The paper focuses on the Canadian Prairies. The analysis suggests a potential
    increase in flash droughts.
  14: The study acknowledges considerable variability in individual model results
    and suggests that other drought stage methodologies may yield different results.
    It recommends similar analyses be carried out for other regions using a variety
    of drought definitions.

    not provide information on macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, costs/benefits
    of adaptation, or the methodology used in a broader economic analysis.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Decreased agricultural production and hydro-electric power generation and increased
    freshwater transportation costs are potential economic effects of drought.

  9: No relevant information
  14: Economic impacts, specifically challenges for sectors such as agriculture and
    water resource management.
Quantitative material:
  8: Drought duration (e.g., 32 months for the 1917-1920 drought); SPEI values (e.g.,
    average SPEI of -1.42 during the 1917-1920 drought); Percentage of area in severe
    drought (e.g., peaking at 81% in June 1918 during the 1917-1920 drought); Temporal
    characteristics of drought stages (growth, persistence, retreat).
  9: Median number of severe droughts per decade for historical, near future (2021-2060),
    and far future (2061-2100) periods under RCPs 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5, as projected
    by 29 GCMs. Projections of drought stage characteristics (growth, persistence,
    retreat, duration, severity, intensity) are quantified in Figure 7a-f.
  14: Doubling of severe drought occurrences by the end of the century with RCP 8.5;
    severe drought durations projected to increase by about half a year for the near
    future, and almost a year for the far future using RCP 8.5; persistence stage
    increase by about three months in the near future and up to about nine months
    in the far future; intensity becomes worse by up to 10 units in the near future
    and about 20 units in the far future.
