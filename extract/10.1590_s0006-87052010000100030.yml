Drivers of Risk:
  4: Changes in global mean temperature and sea-level rise
  5: No relevant information
  8: This paper does not explicitly identify drivers of risk impacting macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes.
Highlights:
  4: Climate change will result in GDP losses, even under a medium-warming scenario,
    and these losses are projected to increase significantly by the end of the century.
  5: No relevant information
  8: This paper does not offer a specific analysis, so has no highlights to provide
Methodology:
  4: Computable general equilibrium (CGE) model using climate projections downscaled
    to the national level. Model simulates climate damages and adaptation.
  5: No relevant information
  8: This paper does not detail a specific methodology for the economic analysis of
    climate change adaptation.
More Notes:
  4: The analysis explicitly incorporates sea-level rise as a driver of risk.
  5: No relevant information
  8: This page appears to be contextual or introductory, lacking concrete analysis
    or results relevant to the specified categories.

  7: No relevant information
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  4: GDP loss
  5: No relevant information
  8: This paper does not include specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, or cost-benefit
    measures of adaptation at a national level.
Quantitative material:
  4: GDP loss of 0.4% below baseline in 2050 increasing to 1.1% below baseline in
    2100 under a medium-warming scenario
  5: No relevant information
  8: This paper does not include quantitative information on the outcomes of interest.
