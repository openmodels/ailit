Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme weather events, total rainfall, mean average temperature, mean minimum
    temperatures
  2: "Climate variability including heavy rains, flooding, droughts, rising sea levels,\
    \ and El Ni\xF1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO); Greenhouse effect; Natural conditions\
    \ such as faults in circulation forms within the monsoon trough as well as human\
    \ actions, such as greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, encroachment on natural\
    \ water resources, improper land use."
  4: Climatic factors, including total rainfall, rainfall intensity, mean average
    temperature, mean minimum temperature, and mean maximum temperature.
  6: Mean minimum temperature, mean maximum temperature, and rainfall intensity have
    a significant adverse effect on the agricultural economy; increases in total rainfall
    and agricultural households positively affect the agricultural economy; agricultural
    land use has a significant positive effect on the variability of the agricultural
    economy; agricultural households and mean average temperature have a significant
    negative effect on the variability of the agricultural economy.
  7: Rainfall intensity, mean maximum temperature, mean minimum temperature, rainfall
    fluctuations.
  8: Extreme events (e.g. related to irrigation and rainfall), climate change (generally),
    agricultural production (contributing to global warming), climate and weather
    variability.
  11: lne^2, where 'e' likely represents an environmental variable or climate change-related
    factor (squared).
  12: Average Temperature (lnAverT), Minimum Temperature (lnMinT), Maximum Temperature
    (lnMaxT), Rainfall (lnRf), and Rainfall Deviation (lnRfd) are the climate-related
    drivers of risk.
Highlights:
  1: Extreme weather events negatively impact the agricultural economy, while increased
    rainfall has a positive association. Temperature increases reduce the variability
    of agricultural growth.
  2: Climate change is an important challenge for the agricultural development of
    Thailand; The study examines non-climatic (agricultural land use and households)
    and climatic (rainfall and temperature) variables to determine the aggregate values
    of the agricultural sector in Thailand.
  5: The ARDL bounds test can establish cointegration based on lnY and the variance
    of lnY (lne^2) equations, including the independent variables of lnA, lnL, lnAverT.
  6: Increases in total rainfall and agricultural households positively affect the
    agricultural economy, while increases in mean maximum temperature, mean minimum
    temperature, and rainfall intensity negatively affect the agricultural economy.
    Agricultural households and mean average temperature negatively affect the variability
    of the agricultural economy, while agricultural land use positively affects the
    variability.
  7: Extreme events such as the increase in mean maximum temperature, mean minimum
    temperature, and rainfall intensification, severely affect the agricultural economy.
    An increase in total rainfall will help mitigate that impact and will increase
    the growth of the agricultural sector in the short-term and long-term period.
  8: Raising awareness of climate change's effect on economic growth is important.
    Agricultural production's environmental impact needs to be considered and supervised.
  11: Cointegration is found for both lnY and lne^2 based on F-statistic and p-value,
    indicating a long-run relationship between GDP and the climate change-related
    factor.
  12: 'Long-run: Average temperature (lnAverT) has a positive and significant impact
    on GDP but a negative and significant impact on energy consumption. Minimum and
    Maximum temperature (lnMinT, lnMaxT) have a significant impact on GDP and energy
    consumption. Rainfall (lnRf) significantly increases GDP but has no significant
    impact on energy consumption. Rainfall Deviation (lnRfd) significantly decreases
    GDP but has no significant impact on energy consumption.'
Methodology:
  1: Panel data analysis from 1995 to 2019 for 76 provinces in Thailand, using unit
    root tests, autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds, and pool mean group
    (PMG) estimation.
  2: Panel data analysis to estimate the impact of climate and weather variability
    on the economic growth of the agricultural sector in Thailand; Includes 76 provinces,
    with time series data from 1995 to 2019.
  4: Panel cointegration using an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) structure
    (bounds cointegration analysis) is applied to capture long-run and short-run dynamic
    effects. Pooled mean group (PMG) estimation is used for the ARDL model.
  5: Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Schwarz information criterion (SIC)
    are used to select lag lengths.
  6: ARDL bounds testing to examine cointegration; PMG estimation based on the ARDL
    structure using the Cobb-Douglas function; long-run coefficients are assumed to
    be homogeneous across provinces, while short-run coefficients are heterogeneous;
    long-run and short-run effects of climatic and non-climatic variables are examined.
  7: ARDL-PMG estimation using the Cobb-Douglas structure is employed.
  8: Empirical study providing an indirect analysis of the impact of climate and weather
    variability on the agricultural economy.
  10: The analysis involves applying panel unit root tests such as LLC, IPS, ADF-Fisher,
    and PP-Fisher to determine the stationarity of economic variables at levels (I(0))
    and first differences (I(1)).
  11: Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds test to determine cointegration
    between the variables. The methodology is applicable for time series data to examine
    long-run relationships.
  12: The analysis uses a Pooled Mean Group (PMG) estimation to assess the long-run
    and short-run effects of the drivers of risk on GDP and Energy consumption. The
    results are applicable to a panel of 76 provinces over 1900 observations.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the agricultural sector in Thailand and uses panel data
    analysis to examine the impact of climate change.

    mitigate climate change impacts as well as adaptation and climate resilience in
    the agricultural sector.

    production efficiency and exploring alternative models and climatic factors for
    future research.
  11: Cases I-V likely refer to different specifications of the ARDL model, possibly
    with different assumptions about deterministic components (e.g., intercept, trend).

    1989 to 2012) was approximately US$ 5.77 billion.
  4: Uses a panel dataset comprising 1,900 observations from 76 provinces in Thailand
    over the period of 1995 to 2019.
  6: A one percent increase in the number of agricultural households will increase
    the agricultural economy by 0.335 percent, and a one percent increase in total
    rainfall will increase the agricultural economy by 2.491 percent; A one percent
    increase in the mean minimum temperature, mean maximum temperature, and rainfall
    intensity will reduce the agricultural economy by 6.223 percent, 6.238 percent,
    and 0.944 percent, respectively; A one percent increase in the number of agricultural
    households will decrease the variability of the agricultural economy by 0.094
    percent, and a one percent increase in mean average temperature will lead to a
    reduction in the variability of the agricultural economy by 2.565 percent; A one
