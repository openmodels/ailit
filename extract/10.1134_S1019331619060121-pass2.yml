Drivers of Risk:
  1: Permafrost thawing and degradation due to global climate change in the Russian
    Arctic.
  2: Permafrost thawing and degradation.
  3: Permafrost degradation (implied, not explicitly stated on this page, but given
    the context of the paper's title and overall theme).
  5: Permafrost thawing and degradation impacting road infrastructure.
  7: Permafrost thawing and degradation.
  8: Thawing and degradation of permafrost due to climate change, specifically accelerated
    growth of surface air temperature.
  9: Permafrost degradation
Highlights:
  1: The study estimates the costs of maintaining road infrastructure in the Russian
    Arctic under different climate change scenarios, highlighting significant financial
    burdens.
  2: Economic assessments of permafrost degradation effects are insufficient.
  3: The transport system, particularly road networks, is crucial for the economies
    of the Russian North, contributing significantly to the Gross Regional Product
    (GRP), especially in relation to mineral resource extraction and transportation.
  5: The study focuses on the impact of permafrost degradation on road infrastructure
    in predominantly permafrost regions of the Russian North.
  7: "Permafrost degradation necessitates significant capital investment in road infrastructure\
    \ repair and reconstruction, with Yakutia facing the highest costs. The conservative\
    \ scenario estimates \u20BD422.68 bln in costs, while the moderate scenario details\
    \ reconstruction and expansion costs alongside repair expenses."
  8: "Risks of disturbing and destroying road infrastructure sustainability under\
    \ permafrost thawing and degradation are very high. Under a moderate scenario,\
    \ the total costs until 2050 will amount to \u20BD 644.48 bln, or \u20BD 21.46\
    \ bln a year, which is equivalent to 0.21% of the total GRP in 2018 of all nine\
    \ regions. Yakutia, Magadan oblast, and Chukotka are expected to be the most affected."
  9: The costs of maintaining road infrastructure sustainability will double under
    the modernization scenario, especially in Chukotka AO, Yakutia, and Magadan oblast.
Methodology:
  1: Three model scenarios are considered for changes in road infrastructure sustainability
    under permafrost thawing, based on six model climate assessments reflecting the
    RCP8.5 scenario of IPCC forecasts. Russia's Transport Strategy until 2035 is used
    to predict road infrastructure development.
  5: The study uses a methodology based on criteria from the International Permafrost
    Association to assess the length of roads located on permafrost. It also models
    the expected damage from permafrost thawing under various climate change scenarios
    and estimates maintenance and modernization costs until 2060. The scenarios are
    based on Russia's Transport Strategy until 2030.
  7: Considers scenarios of permafrost thawing and degradation effects on road infrastructure
    sustainability and estimates risk (expected damage) reduction costs for 2020-2050.
    Uses a conservative scenario (constant repair investment) and a moderate scenario
    (road reconstruction).
  8: Calculations based on a methodology assessing the effects of permafrost thawing
    and degradation on the sustainability of road infrastructure in the Russian Arctic.
  9: Scenario modeling
More Notes:
  1: The maximum costs are relevant for the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Magadan oblast,
    and the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. The modernization scenario requires revisions
    to standards, technologies, and cost estimation methods.
  2: The study focuses on the economic assessment of permafrost thawing and degradation
    in nine regions of the Russian North.
  3: The paper focuses on the economic assessment of permafrost degradation effects,
    this specific page emphasizes the importance of transportation infrastructure
    to the GRP in regions of the Russian North that will likely be affected by permafrost
    degradation.
  5: The assessment considers costs additional to regular maintenance due to permafrost
    effects, not normal wear and tear. The study uses Russian Mintrans data on construction,
    reconstruction, and repair costs.
  7: The cost estimates are based on data from nine regions of the Russian North.
    The paper acknowledges that current cost assessments may be conventional due to
    the expired depreciation life of many fixed assets. The length and quality of
    the road network in each region impact the associated costs.
  8: 'The paper considers three scenarios: Conservative, Moderate, and Modernization,
    each involving different levels of road reconstruction and new road construction.'
  9: The paper argues for revising existing standards and technologies, favoring innovative
    'green' standards and construction technologies, and improving cost assessment
    methodologies. It also calls for long-term (until 2050) economic growth forecasts
    and consideration in the new Strategy of Russian Arctic Development until 2035.

  9: Costs of maintaining road infrastructure sustainability
Quantitative material:
  1: "Capital costs to maintain road infrastructure sustainability will average at\
    \ least \u20BD14 bln a year under the inertial scenario, and will exceed \u20BD\
    21 bln and \u20BD28 bln, respectively, under the moderate and modernization scenarios\
    \ (for 2020-2050)."
  2: "Up to \u20BD55 bln are spent annually to maintain pipeline working capacity\
    \ and eliminate mechanical deformations related to permafrost soil disturbance."
  3: "Cargo transportation volumes by motor, rail, and inland waterway for several\
    \ regions of the Russian North in 2017 (Table 1). Length of surfaced roads (total,\
    \ hard-surface, and improved hard-surface) in regions of the Russian North in\
    \ 2018 (Table 2). Contribution of mineral resource extraction to total gross regional\
    \ product (GRP) in the regions of the Russian North is 44% in 2017. The value\
    \ of GRP in 2017 exceeded \u20BD10 trillion, or 10.91% of the country\u2019s GDP.\
    \ Contribution of the transport system to the total gross regional product is\
    \ about 7%. Construction cost of 1 km of new roads is \u20BD11.73 \u2013 \u20BD\
    52.28 mln (net of VAT)."

    \ repairs in nine regions, including \u20BD252.83 bln for Yakutia; Average additional\
    \ costs of \u20BD14.07 bln per year, or 0.14% of the total gross regional product\
    \ of all nine regions in 2018. Moderate scenario: \u20BD304.24 bln additionally\
    \ spent on capital repairs of roadbed and engineering facilities in 2020-2050\
    \ due to permafrost degradation; Reconstruction of part of the road network with\
    \ improved quality in 2020\u20132030 and the subsequent maintenance and upkeep\
    \ of this infrastructure in 2030\u20132050 are estimated at \u20BD272.9 bln; Cost\
    \ of expanding the motor road network in 2020\u20132030 and its subsequent operating\
    \ costs will amount to \u20BD67.34 bln."

    sustainability will double
