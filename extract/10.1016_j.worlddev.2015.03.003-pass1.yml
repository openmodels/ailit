Drivers of Risk:
  3: Drought
  4: Extreme weather events (droughts, typhoons, floods), increased variation of temperature
    and rainfall, delayed rainfall, volatile rain patterns
  5: Droughts and rainfall shocks are identified as drivers affecting child growth
    and long-term socioeconomic outcomes.
  6: Drought (measured by comparing current precipitation patterns with historic trends).
  7: External factors such as poorly and unequally distributed rainfall, internal
    factors like ongoing deforestation, cultivation of water-intensive crops, and
    increased unregulated industrial activity.
  11: Varying exposure to drought
  13: Drought incidence is identified as a shock impacting outcomes, with rainfall
    shortfalls noted as a key driving factor behind drought.
  16: Rainfall shortage (drought severity varying between 55 and 993 mm); annual precipitation
    estimates mapped for each district in Vietnam.
  18: Drought severity
  20: Drought severity (3-month average), demographic factors (age, gender), economic
    factors (total consumption, crop income share, asset index, off-farm income)
  22: Drought severity
  24: Drought (1/0), Illness
  25: Drought-related illness incidence.
  32: Drought severity and length of dry spells are impacting health outcomes.
Highlights:
  3: Drought leads to a deterioration of health conditions and significantly higher
    health expenditures, especially among households with high agricultural dependency
    and limited coping mechanisms.
  4: Weather shocks are the single most important cause that pushes households below
    the poverty line in most countries. Vietnam is particularly vulnerable due to
    its geography.
  5: "Droughts adversely affect child growth and lead to under-investments in schooling,\
    \ particularly affecting women\u2019s outcomes in adulthood."
  6: Drought increases the likelihood of illness, particularly for the working-age
    population. Drought-related health shocks cause substantial financial cost, representing
    a significant burden on household budgets.
  7: Droughts have significant adverse effects on people's livelihoods in rural Vietnam.
  15: No relevant information
  16: Rainfall shortage (drought severity) is a prevalent risk factor in the sample
    regions. Informal social networks provide a degree of resilience against hardship.
  18: Drought severity is significantly associated with an increased probability of
    illness at the household level; However, no significant association between BMI
    levels or BMI drops and drought for individuals above the age of 15 is observed.
  20: The effect of drought on individual illness is more pronounced in households
    with a greater dependency on agriculture as an income source. Drought severity
    is statistically significantly related to illness and rice price. Age and gender
    also play a role in determining the impact of drought on illness.
  22: Drought severity is positively and significantly associated with illness. The
    impact of drought on illness is moderated by various insurance mechanisms and
    social/ethnic factors, though these moderating effects vary in sign and significance
    depending on the specific factor.
  24: Drought has an effect on health expenditures. Results are applicable across
    different age groups (0-10 years to 51-60 years), different income groups, and
    include controls for household size and dependency ratio.
  25: Drought-related illness significantly impacts household health expenditures,
    especially for lower-income groups in Vietnam.
  32: The three-month timescale of drought severity has the highest explanatory power
    for illness incidence.
Methodology:
  3: Analysis uses local rainfall data and a multiple-wave panel of rural Vietnamese
    households, with an IV strategy.
  4: Literature review on the effects of extreme weather on developing countries,
    with specific focus on Vietnam
  5: Based on historical rainfall data to examine the long-term effects on health
    outcomes; includes panel data analysis from Zimbabwe and Ethiopia.
  6: Panel data analysis (2007-2013) using variation over time and space; Instrumental
    Variable (IV) approach to estimate the effect of drought on monetary health expenditures.
  7: This paper scrutinizes the relation between drought and health at the micro-level.
  11: The analysis uses an instrumental variable (IV) approach to isolate the drought-related
    component of health shocks. Illness incidence is instrumented using varying exposure
    to drought. The analysis focuses on the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)
    of changes in illness incidence due to variation in exposure to drought.
  13: The analysis uses external data from satellite images to measure local rainfall
    conditions, comparing actual rainfall to its historic mean at the district level
    in Vietnam.
  16: Household survey data is used, including a hypothetical lending question to
    proxy for informal insurance networks. Drought severity is calculated as the cumulated
    rainfall shortage over 'dry' periods throughout the year.
  18: OLS regressions with standard errors clustered on household-level, controlling
    for age, gender, consumption, wave fixed effects, and province fixed effects.
    Analysis includes individuals and survey waves.
  20: OLS regressions with household-level clustered standard errors, wave and province
    fixed effects. The results are applicable to the specific context of the data
    used in the analysis.
  22: OLS regressions with standard errors clustered at the household level. Controls
    are included as in Table 2. The analysis includes wave and province fixed effects.
    The sample covers 33927 to 34293 observations.
  24: Tobit, IV-Tobit regressions. Wave-FE and Province-FE indicate the inclusion
    of Wave and Province fixed effects.
  25: IV-Tobit estimation with the share of ill household members instrumented by
    the severity of drought. The study uses data from Vietnam, with separate regressions
    for lower and upper parts of the wealth distribution.
  32: The analysis uses OLS regressions with different measures of drought to assess
    their relation to illness incidence.
More Notes:
  3: The paper focuses on the immediate impact of drought on health conditions.
  5: Focuses on health and educational impacts rather than direct macroeconomic or
    fiscal outcomes.
  6: "The study focuses on rural Vietnam and highlights the vulnerability of households\
    \ with high agricultural dependency and limited coping mechanisms. A government-subsidized\
    \ pro-poor health insurance scheme is found to reduce the adverse e\uFB00ects\
    \ of drought on health."
  7: The paper focuses on the micro-level relationship between drought and health,
    particularly in rural Vietnam, emphasizing channels like agricultural output,
    nutrition, and disease.
  11: The analysis is based on a panel survey of over 2,000 households in rural provinces
    of Vietnam (Ha Tinh, Thua Thien Hue, and Dak Lak) between 2007 and 2013.
  15: The study appears to be focused on the relationship between drought and health
    outcomes, not macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes. It might be useful indirectly
    if health impacts are linked to productivity, but this isn't explicitly stated
    on this page.
  16: The paper focuses on micro-level household responses to shocks. It does not
    directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes.
  18: The analysis focuses on the impact of drought on health outcomes rather than
    direct macroeconomic or fiscal variables. The impact of drought on health outcomes
    might indirectly affect productivity, but this connection is not explicitly analyzed
    in this paper.
  20: The table shows the impact of drought and other factors on individual illness
    and rice price. This suggests potential microeconomic impacts that, in aggregate,
    could have macroeconomic or fiscal consequences.
  22: The study explores the role of formal (HCFP, private health insurance) and informal
    (social networks, ethnicity) insurance mechanisms in mitigating the impact of
    drought on illness.
  24: 'Significance levels are indicated by asterisks: * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.
    The dependent variable is related to health expenditures.'
  25: The study addresses endogeneity concerns by using drought severity as an instrument
    for illness. The wealth distribution is assigned by a basic asset index in the
    first wave.

Quantitative material:
  3: Drought-related health shocks can cause non-negligible additional financial burden
    for many households vulnerable to poverty in rural Vietnam.
  5: 'Quantitative evidence on growth impact during drought: children aged 12 to 24
    months in Zimbabwe lose 1.5 to 2 cm of growth; Ethiopian children between 6 and
    24 months experienced 0.9 cm less growth over a six-month period during droughts.'
  6: Drought-related health shocks can make up around one fifth of what a typical
    households normally spends on food items.
  7: "Economic damage was 110 million USD, or roughly 0.2 % of the country\u2019s\
    \ GDP (for the 2005 drought)."
  15: No relevant information
  16: Out-of-pocket food expenditures lie between 33 and 2162 PPP USD; about two thirds
    of the people have access to some kind of health insurance, i.e., either the free
    health insurance program for the poor (57 %) or some form of private health insurance
    scheme (7 %);  households needing 15 million Vietnamese Dong (VND) (~705 USD);
    more than half of the respondents indicate to turn to informal assistance from
    their social network in cases of hardship; drought severity varies between 55
    and 993 mm.
  18: Living in the most drought-affected district increases the probability of illness
    by about nine percentage points compared to living in the least drought-affected
    district; A change of one standard deviation in drought severity (0.21) causes
    the propensity of illness to rise by two percentage points.
  20: Drought severity has a statistically significant positive effect on illness
    (columns 1-5) and rice price (column 6). Specific coefficients and standard errors
    are provided in the table. The effects of drought are also shown to vary depending
    on interactions with other parameters.
  22: Table 4 presents OLS regression results showing the impact of drought severity
    and various insurance mechanisms on illness, including coefficients, standard
    errors, and significance levels. For example, a 3-month average drought severity
    has a statistically significant positive association with illness across all models
    (coefficients ranging from 0.0793 to 0.1060). The interaction term 'Drought *
    Ethnic fract.' has a statistically significant positive impact on illness with
    a coefficient of 0.2472 in column 4.
  24: The table includes coefficients and standard errors related to drought severity
    and illness on health expenditures.
  25: Drought-related illness incidence is estimated to increase health expenditures
    by roughly 144 PPP USD for all income groups. For the lower part of the wealth
    distribution, the effect of drought-related illness on the household budget is
    estimated close to 90 PPP USD.
