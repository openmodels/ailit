  251: Sea level rise and precipitation levels (High Sea Level/Extreme Precipitation
    and Low Sea Level/Low Precipitation scenarios).
  252: 'Two extreme scenarios: Low Sea Level/Low Precipitation and High Sea Level/Extreme
    Precipitation.'
  253: Sea level rise, precipitation levels, discount rates, and uncertainties about
    the future.
  254: High sea level scenario; uncertainty in future conditions requiring adaptation.
  256: The paper mentions deep uncertainty, ranging from future technological innovation,
    demand for LNG, sea level rise, and changes in precipitation, implying these are
    potential drivers of risk.
  268: Possible climate changes, uncertain factors, variations in climate variables
    such as temperature and precipitation, and possible alternative realizations of

    increase) and socio-economic conditions (population increase, economic growth).
  331: Climate change, including increases in the likelihood of extreme weather events.
  332: Concern was raised about flood safety standards being outdated and the increased
    chances of flooding due to climate change.
  334: Flood risk, freshwater availability, economic setbacks, political instability,
    climate adaptation.

  346: Flooding (specifically, near flooding of the Rhine and Meuse rivers in 1993
    and 1995)
  347: Climatic and socio-economic developments; Acceleration of the deterioration
    processes of the Antarctic ice cover (possibly leading to an increase of the sea
    level rise); An increase in the frequency and intensity of cloudbursts.
  369: Mentions that the uncertainty space where a policy fails is focused on climate
    change information, relevant for identifying drivers of risk.
Highlights:
  17: Decisions that ignore deep uncertainty may simplify choices in the short term
    but could incur higher long-term costs.
  20: The best policy is one that produces the most favorable outcomes across plausible
    future scenarios, with scenario analysis being used for Level 3 uncertainty.
  23: DMDU approaches are beneficial in contexts of deep uncertainty, complexity,
    and flexible policy options, as opposed to traditional predict-then-act methods.
  26: No relevant information
  35: "RDM can identify a robust mix of policy instruments\u2014carbon taxes and technology\
    \ subsidies\u2014for reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
  50: The study compares price- and subsidy-based strategies.
  52: Taxes Only and Combined strategies consistently perform better than No Action
    and Subsidies Only strategies.
  73: The table outlines potential vulnerabilities and opportunities for Schiphol
    Airport and suggests hedging and shaping actions to address them.
  74: Noise complaints may increase with population growth and changing noise valuation;
    capacity challenges during adverse weather conditions are highlighted.
  75: The planning process involves implementing initial plans, monitoring developments,
    taking actions when signposts indicate a need, and reassessing the plan when necessary,
    including the use of "real options".
  81: DAPP helps to overcome policy paralysis due to deep uncertainty.
  86: The approach focuses on identifying adaptation tipping points (ATPs) and designing
    pathways that consider multiple and correlated uncertainties represented in scenarios.
    It allows for the identification of opportunities, no-regret actions, lock-ins,
    and the timing of actions.
  90: The Waas River area's transport and local industries are vulnerable to navigation
    disruptions due to climate-related low-flow events.
  91: System already performing unacceptably with a non-navigable duration of 29 days,
    triggering immediate need for action.
  92: Different adaptation actions have different costs, and the effectiveness of
    each action varies under different climate futures, as shown by the ATPs. "Small
    Dredge" policy option compared to the others have a significant variability in
    outcomes. The current policy reaches a tipping point after 4 years.
  93: The preferred adaptive plan involves small-scale dredging in the short term,
    with options to shift to other actions in the future. Pathways 6-8 are identified
    as preferred pathways based on a scorecard.
  94: Presents different adaptation pathways for low-flow management and evaluates
    their performance based on costs, benefits, and co-benefits. Some pathways have
    higher costs but may also have higher benefits or co-benefits. Some pathways have
    negative co-benefits.
  98: DAPP is constantly evolving, being elaborated upon, and has been applied in
    different jurisdictions and contexts.  Challenges remain in demonstrating the
    value of the DAPP approach to practitioners and policymakers. Further application
    of DAPP is needed to resource-constrained local planning challenges.
  108: "The robust-satis\uFB01cing approach prioritizes robustness against uncertainty\
    \ over optimizing the substantive quality of the decision's outcome. The outcome\
    \ must be satisfactory, but the robustness is optimized."
  111: Prioritizing strategies based solely on predicted performance is unreliable
    due to deep uncertainties; robustness against uncertainty is more important.
  115: 'Robustness trades off against performance: increased robustness requires relaxing
    performance requirements. Zeroing property: robustness becomes zero when the critical
    displacement matches the predicted displacement from the best estimate model.'
  118: Robustness and opportuneness are sympathetic with respect to change in stiffness;
    Robustness and opportuneness are antagonistic with respect to the error in the
    estimated stiffness.
  119: An innovation can be better than the current state-of-the-art in predicted
    performance, but more uncertain in its actual performance.
  126: EOA deals with deeper uncertainties, handles multiple options simultaneously,
    and allows for all sorts of measures of benefits and values, unlike Real Options
    Analysis (ROA).
  127: EOA offers a flexible strategy framework that maximizes long-term success in
    the face of uncertainty.
  128: EOA helps obtain insights into which strategy provides the best outcomes and
    why.
  132: EOA informs decisionmakers and stakeholders quantitatively about their strategic
    choices, helping them to make good decisions about adaptation strategies.
  133: EOA suggests that a modular, flexible strategy (e.g., modular plants) can provide
    greater expected gains, lower risks, and substantial savings in initial capital
    expenditures compared to a single large facility.
  134: A flexible design that starts with a smaller structure but includes extra strength
    for future expansion is the preferred strategy.
  143: RDM can be used to develop robust strategies that are adaptive, identifying
    both near-term decisions and guidance for how these responses should change as
    the future unfolds.
  144: Traditional water management strategies must adapt to changing hydrologic conditions
    and societal needs that are no longer increasing at a gradual and predictable
    pace; DMDU methods are increasingly being recommended as best practice for long-term
    water resources planning.
  150: Under current management, the Upper and Lower Basins may fail to meet water
    delivery reliability objectives under many plausible futures, particularly with
    low historical supply conditions (low streamflow and drought).
  152: Aggressive water management strategies can keep Lake Mead above 1000 feet.
    Different signposts and triggers lead to different investments. Portfolio A (Inclusive)
    has the greatest potential to prevent water delivery vulnerability but risks incurring
    the highest costs. Portfolio D (Common Options) limits costs but also the potential
    to reduce vulnerabilities.
  153: There is a trade-off between vulnerability and cost for different water management
    portfolios under declining supply conditions; more aggressive investment strategies
    lead to fewer missed objectives but increase the range of costs. Adaptive strategies
    do not completely eliminate regret.
  154: Static strategies have highest regret in either high or low streamflow conditions.
    Adaptive strategies are more balanced in terms of regret across different streamflow
    conditions.
  158: Current water management strategies considered in the Basin Study may not be
    sufficient to ensure acceptable outcomes under many plausible future conditions,
    particularly when the probability of severely declining supply is 30% or higher.  In
    those cases, more transformative options are needed.
  162: "Optimal policy may keep global temperature increases below 2 \xB0C only in\
    \ some scenarios; higher R&D returns can lead to parity in technology productivity\
    \ under favorable conditions."
  163: Implementation of an international carbon tax may not be sufficient to meet
    Paris objectives under many scenarios; Elasticity of substitution between SETs
    and FETs is a key factor for optimal policy response; Technological and climate
    uncertainties are equally influential; Technological progress of SETs relative
    to FETs can affect the structure and effect of optimal environmental regulation
    to the same degree as climate uncertainty.
  172: The adaptive plan developed through DAP is considered a promising step toward
    large-scale implementation of ISA in the Netherlands, and DAP is seen as a useful
    approach for dealing with deep uncertainty.
  176: ISA implementation can lead to accident reductions, with varying degrees of
    effectiveness depending on the type of ISA and speed limit.
  177: 'There are five types of actions to increase the robustness of the plan: mitigating
    actions, hedging actions, seizing actions, exploiting actions, and shaping actions.'
  180: The paper describes a workshop process for dynamic adaptive planning.
  208: IG supports confident decision-making using simulations by establishing the
    robustness of the forecast performance to modeling assumptions and sources of
    uncertainty. Preference should be given to the more robust solution, which tolerates
    more uncertainty without endangering performance.
  223: There is a trade-off between performance requirement (critical stress) and
    robustness to uncertainty. More demanding requirements are less robust to uncertainty.
  225: A variant design is more robust than a nominal design when considering modeling
    uncertainty.
  227: No relevant information
  229: EOA can provide insights into innovative developments and the advantage of
    flexibility in size, time, and location of facilities.
  230: EOA helps identify preferable strategies for infrastructure development under
    deep uncertainty, guiding decision-makers toward better solutions by focusing
    on flexible first steps rather than fixed solutions.
  234: Learning phenomenon encourages the use of modular flexibility, counterbalancing
    economies of scale and promoting smaller, more immediate investments.
  236: Deterministic analysis overestimates the value of a plant design (NPV) compared
    to analysis that accounts for uncertainty (ENPV). Analyses recognizing uncertainty
    lead to systematically smaller optimal designs compared to deterministic analysis.
  238: A flexible strategy (capacity expansion at the main production site when demand
    justifies it) has a higher expected NPV than a fixed design.
  239: Flexible strategies systematically lead to more valuable results; Flexibility
    to locate capacity away from the main site increases system ENPV and maximum NPV;
    Starting small reduces downside risk and increases upside potential.
  240: "Flexible strategies (timing, time+place) generally outperform fixed designs\
    \ in terms of ENPV, Value at Risk, and Value at Gain. A flexible strategy involving\
    \ both time and location might seem better, even though it does not dominate the\
    \ flexible strategy that only considers the timing of additions, because it offers\
    \ the highest expected NPV\u2014less downside risk than the fixed design, and\
    \ greater upside potential. Learning increases the value of flexibility by reducing\
    \ the cost of modules as more get implemented."
  241: Lower economies of scale and greater learning rates increase the value of flexibility.
    Flexibility offers significant potential.
  245: The study aims to identify a wise first step replacement strategy that offers
    the ability to maintain service reliability as future uncertainty resolves itself.
  250: Compares different courses of action based on lifecycle costs.
  251: Reactive Adaptive and Proactive Flexible designs outperform the Fixed design.
    Proactive Flexible is more valuable in riskier scenarios and when no discounting
    is used.
  252: A Reactive Adaptive design can become the dominant solution when future costs
    are discounted over the long-project horizon, especially at a discount rate of
    5.5%, erasing the disadvantage of expensive future adaptations associated with
    Proactive Flexible designs. The simulation approach provides distributions of
    outcomes, offering insights into specific conditions favoring different designs.
  253: Proactive Flexible designs for flood defense are cheaper than Fixed designs
    as they defer costs, and Reactive Adaptive designs are cheaper to build initially
    but can lead to substantial future upgrade costs. The preferred choice between
    Reactive Adaptive and Proactive Flexible designs depends on decisionmakers' beliefs
    about the future and willingness to bear worst-case outcomes.
  254: Reactive Adaptive design has lower average cost but a larger range of possible
    outcomes; EOA produces practical, useful insights for decisionmakers; Reactive
    Adaptive and Proactive Flexible designs are preferred for design elements contributing
    to the pumping station's ability to regulate inland water levels.
  255: For the IJmuiden case, EOA analysis shows added value from incorporating an
    option in the design of pumping facilities for inland water regulation. Flexibility
    in flood defense height did not substantially improve lifetime cost performance
    compared to a fixed design. EOA does not prescribe a single plan, but focuses
    on starting on a path that leads to desirable developments while avoiding downside
    risks.
  256: EOA produces distributions of results, providing valuable insights concerning
    worst-case outcomes and tradeoffs among objectives, which is unavailable from
    average outcomes alone.
  264: DS exposes climate conditions that are problematic for specific sectors and
    facilitates the evaluation of adaptive responses to these conditions.
  265: Decision analytic framework exploits advances in computing to identify the
    scenarios where adaptation decisions are favored and what information is needed.
  271: Identifies climate changes that are problematic and may require adaptation.
  272: The climate response surface is a two-dimensional visualization showing the
    climate conditions that cause unacceptable performance.
  274: The adapted system can be more robust, performing acceptably over more of the
    future space.
  275: application of DS to characterize the risk that climate change poses to the
    water supply reliability for Colorado Springs.
  286: Accounting for intra-family model correlations significantly increases the
    estimated risk to the water utility compared to assuming independence, leading
    to a non-negligible probability of unacceptable system performance.
  287: The DS process is designed to provide guidance from the often confusing set
    of climate information available to decisionmakers, by generating climate information
    that improves decisions through a bottom-up analysis.
  319: Instances of tacit triggers do not occur in state-based cases.
  328: "The Dutch Delta Plan, financed from the Delta Fund, aims to mitigate flood\
    \ risk and manage freshwater resources with a planning horizon to 2100. An annual\
    \ budget of over \u20AC1 billion until the end of 2028 was allocated."
  331: Existing policy instruments need to be re-calibrated to better include long-term
    climate-related costs and benefits in investment decisions.
  332: The Second Delta Committee's advice was quickly accepted, and most recommendations
    were incorporated into official policy within four months.
  334: The Delta Act led to remarkable results in a period of economic setbacks and
    political instability by decoupling long-term perspectives from the heat of the
    day.
  342: Transition from incremental to transformational adaptation strategies is inevitable
    in the long term due to climate change, but difficult to plan and implement proactively.
  346: Shifted from solely strengthening dikes to giving rivers more room; broadened
    the knowledge community associated with flood safety; new flood safety standard
    developed by the Delta programme incorporates population and value of investments.
  384: The paper emphasizes the importance of observation and orientation (monitoring)
    as precursors to decision and action, particularly in the context of slow-moving
    climate dynamics and potential for sudden, catastrophic losses. It also critiques
    the tendency in public policy to focus on producing plans rather than on the ongoing
    process of planning and the 'once-and-done' approach to policy decisions.
  397: 'DMDU approaches share recurring principles: create a shared strategic vision,
    explore adaptive strategies, commit to short-term actions while keeping long-term
    options open, and prepare a framework for future actions. Decision-makers should
    accept irreducible uncertainties and reduce uncertainty about policy performance.'
Methodology:
  5: The book provides a unified and comprehensive treatment of approaches and tools
    for developing policies under deep uncertainty, focusing on their application.
    It elucidates the state of the art in both theory and practice associated with
    these approaches and tools.
  17: Incorporating a systematic consideration of deep uncertainty in practical decision
    making through different approaches and tools.
  20: Level 3 uncertainty involves using scenario analysis with best-estimate models
    to examine policy outcomes across plausible future scenarios.
  21: Discusses four levels of uncertainty in decision-making, from Level 1 (lack
    of information) to Level 4 (deep uncertainty), and their implications for selecting
    appropriate models, probability distributions, and valuing outcomes; scenarios
    are also discussed as a means of addressing future uncertainties.
  22: 'The paper considers various systems for dealing with uncertainty including:
    Ignorance (no model), Deep Uncertainty (range of plausible models, unknown weights),
    Limited Knowledge (range of plausible models, limited outcomes), Alternate futures
    (scenarios with attached probabilities), and Determinism (single outcome).'
  23: The paper discusses Decision-Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) approaches,
    which are used when uncertainties are deep and policies have multiple degrees
    of freedom.
  24: The paper discusses decision-making under deep uncertainty (DMDU) and contrasts
    it with traditional 'predict-then-act' approaches. It advocates for a 'monitor
    and adapt' paradigm, which emphasizes preparing for uncertain events and adapting
    over time as knowledge is gained. It mentions analytical tools like exploratory
    modeling and scenario discovery, and approaches like adaptive approaches, for
    handling deep uncertainty.
  26: Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) approaches involving framing the
    analysis by formulating a triggering issue, specifying uncertainties, exploring
    outcomes of policies given uncertainties (using models or expert opinions), choosing
    initial and contingent actions, planning for communicating, monitoring, and making
    possible adaptations of the policy, and then iterating and re-examining.
  28: Scenario Discovery (SD) is used to distinguish futures in which proposed strategies
    meet or miss their goals, by identifying combinations of future conditions that
    best distinguish the cases in which the policy or strategy does or does not meet
    its goals.
  35: RDM embeds analytic tools in a decision support process called 'deliberation
    with analysis' that promotes learning and consensus-building among stakeholders.
  41: EM facilitates exploration of futures and strategies by reducing requirements
    for analytic tractability and enabling truly global sensitivity explorations.
  42: RDM follows 'deliberation with analysis,' facilitating stakeholder deliberation
    informed by quantitative system models, applicable in dynamic decision environments.
  43: RDM employs statistical Scenario Discovery algorithms to characterize vulnerabilities
    by distinguishing futures where proposed strategies meet or miss their goals.
  44: Robust Decision Making (RDM) is used, involving scenario planning, multi-objective
    tradeoff analyses, identification of robust strategies, and adaptive decision
    strategies. It uses both absolute and relative performance measures to compare
    strategies.
  48: Integrated EM (Exploration and Modeling) packages can facilitate RDM analysis
    by providing connectivity between simulation models and analysis/visualization
    tools. These packages allow users to specify experimental designs, run cases,
    store results, use visualization routines, run SD and statistical algorithms,
    and use robust optimization routines.
  50: Agent-based model of technology diffusion linked to a simple macromodel of economic
    growth. The model compares strategies incorporating a carbon tax and a technology
    price subsidy for low-carbon-emitting technologies, configured as adaptive strategies
    evolving over time in response to new information.
  51: An agent-based model is used with thirty input parameters representing uncertain
    factors. The model uses a genetic algorithm to generate an ensemble of 1,611 plausible
    futures based on constraints from economic theory, microeconomic literature, and
    macroeconomic data from the last fifty years.
  52: The study used an agent-based model to simulate different carbon tax and technology
    subsidy policies, using importance sampling to identify key uncertainties.
  65: DAP involves steps like identifying vulnerable assumptions, monitoring, and
    implementing contingent actions if specific signposts reach critical levels.
  69: The paper illustrates how Dynamic Adaptive Planning (DAP) can be applied to
    the long-term development of Schiphol Airport. It's a simplified example to clarify
    the approach, not a realistic plan.
  74: Analysis includes assessing vulnerabilities and opportunities related to noise
    pollution and capacity at Schiphol Airport.
  75: The paper describes a dynamic adaptive planning process that includes monitoring,
    triggers, and actions to respond to changing conditions. The plan involves initial
    steps and contingent actions based on pre-defined triggers related to demand,
    capacity, and environmental impacts. If the negative impacts are too severe, the
    plan should be reassessed and updated with a new adaptive plan.
  81: It supports the design of a dynamic adaptive strategy that includes initial
    actions, long-term options, and adaptation signals to identify when to implement
    long-term options or revisit decisions.
  82: Describes the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) approach to planning under
    conditions of deep uncertainty, integrating Dynamic Adaptive Planning and adaptation
    pathways. It uses Adaptation Tipping Points (ATPs) to identify conditions under
    which a policy will fail, then uses scenarios to assess when this may happen.
  83: Pathways can focus on adaptation, socio-economic development, or transitioning
    to a desired future.
  85: Approaches to identifying ATPs include 'bottom-up' vulnerability assessments
    and 'top-down' scenario analyses.
  86: 'A four-step approach is used: (1) Problem analysis, (2) Identifying adaptation
    tipping points (ATPs) under different scenarios, (3) Identifying contingent actions
    and assessing their ATP conditions and timing, (4) Designing and evaluating pathways.
    Scenario planning is used to represent uncertainties and their development over
    time. The efficacy of actions is assessed over changing conditions or time. Ineffective
    actions are screened out. Pathway maps are created to summarise policy actions
    and potential pathways to reach objectives under changing conditions.'
  90: Utilizes a top-down analytical approach using transient scenarios as part of
    a Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) framework.
  91: Analysis performed using Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) with an Integrated
    Assessment Meta-Model (IAMM).
  92: The analysis considers "plausible climate futures" and uses an "Adaptation Tipping
    Point" (ATP) approach. Box plots of ATPs are presented, suggesting the analysis
    involves simulations or modeling to determine when adaptation actions are required.
  93: The paper uses Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) to evaluate different
    adaptation strategies. The analysis involves scoring pathways based on costs,
    benefits, and flexibility, and aims to identify preferred adaptation plans.
  94: Adaptation pathways mapping and scorecard evaluation of pathway performance
    under a high-end scenario.
  98: Discusses Decision-Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) approaches, specifically
    DAPP (Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways) and CRIDA. DAPP involves establishing
    the decision context, performing vulnerability analysis, formulating actions,
    evaluating alternatives, and institutionalizing decisions. CRIDA is a risk-informed
    approach similar to DAPP.
  104: Info-gap models of uncertainty provide a non-probabilistic quantification of
    Knightian uncertainty.
  108: "The paper describes a 'robust-satis\uFB01cing' approach to decision-making\
    \ under uncertainty. This involves evaluating a candidate decision based on whether\
    \ its putative performance satisfies requirements given the best understanding\
    \ (model). Then it assesses how much the model can change without violating performance\
    \ requirements. The decision with the largest range of uncertainty within which\
    \ performance requirements are guaranteed is preferred."
  111: Info-Gap Decision Theory (IG) is used to assess strategies under deep uncertainty,
    focusing on robustness rather than optimization. It considers flexibility, comprehensiveness,
    and adaptability in decision-making.
  115: "Info-Gap Decision Theory (IG) is used to analyze the trade-off between robustness\
    \ and performance under uncertainty. The approach calculates the robustness function,\
    \ \u02C6h(x_c), which represents the greatest value of the uncertainty horizon\
    \ 'h' up to which a minimum performance requirement x_c is met. Zeroing occurs\
    \ when the robustness becomes zero precisely at the value of the critical displacement\
    \ x_c that is predicted by the putative model (best estimate)."
  118: "Info-gap decision theory is used to analyze robustness (\u02C6h) and opportuneness\
    \ (\u02C6\u03B2) with respect to uncertainties in estimated stiffness (\u02DC\
    K) and its error (s). Equations (5.5) and (5.7) are central to the analysis. \
    \ Applicability is when there's a need to choose between options with different\
    \ levels of uncertainty and potential outcomes (robustness vs. opportuneness)."
  119: Info-Gap Decision Theory is used to compare an innovative option versus the
    state-of-the-art option under uncertainty.
  126: Engineering Options Analysis (EOA) is presented as an approach to quantitative
    analysis for planning, design, and management of engineering systems over time,
    in the context of uncertainty. It involves assessing the value of flexibility
    in design and management of technical systems, calculating the value of options,
    and presenting benefits to decisionmakers in terms of average expectations, extreme
    possibilities, and initial investment.
  127: By sampling the range of uncertain possibilities according to their estimated
    distributions, EOA develops distributions of possible outcomes.
  128: EOA caters directly to the informational needs of stakeholders and is 'fit
    for purpose' for decisionmakers, managers, and others concerned with an issue.

    specifying objectives, developing an analytic model, generating options, exploring
    uncertainties with scenarios, calculating system performance, reducing data for
    stakeholders, supporting decision-making, and implementing a monitoring system.
  132: The process includes characterizing uncertainties, generating scenarios, calculating
    system performance across scenarios, reducing data for stakeholder consideration,
    and supporting the choice of a preferred starting decision and plan.

    under deep uncertainty, involving monitoring developments and readjusting strategies.
  134: Engineering Options Analysis (EOA) is used, which involves formulating the
    opportunity, specifying objectives, developing a model, specifying options, specifying
    uncertainties and generating scenarios, calculating performance, reducing data
    for stakeholder consideration, and choosing a preferred strategy.

  152: CRSS modeled portfolios as adaptive strategies by simulating investment decisions
    a basin manager would take under different simulated Basin conditions. An agent
    monitors key signpost variables on an annual basis, implementing water management
    actions when conditions drop below predefined thresholds.
  153: Robust Decision Making (RDM) is applied to evaluate different portfolios (strategies)
    under various supply conditions, using metrics like Lower Basin Vulnerability
    (Lake Mead Pool Elevation) and Lee Ferry Deficit. Regret is defined as the additional
    amount of total annual supply (volume of water, in maf) that would be needed to
    maintain the Lake Mead level at 1000 feet across the simulation.
  154: Compares static strategies to adaptive strategies under different future conditions,
    assessing the level of regret (defined by the percent of futures with low regret)
    associated with each strategy.
  158: Robust Decision Making (RDM) analysis is used to evaluate adaptive strategies.
    The Basin Study analysis evaluated four adaptive strategies and follow-on work
    explored how to develop a robust adaptive strategy to guide investments.
  160: Exploratory Dynamic Integrated Assessment Model (EDIAM)
  161: Uses the Exploratory Dynamic Integrated Assessment Model (EDIAM) to explore
    how different policies could shape technology development and transfer and reduce
    GHG emissions and mitigate climate change across a range of plausible futures.  The
    ensemble is derived using a mixed experimental design of a full factorial sampling
    of 12 climate model responses (scenarios) and a 300-element Latin Hypercube sample
    across the seven technological factors.

    the stage, assembling the initial plan, increasing the robustness of the initial
    plan, setting up the monitoring system, and preparing contingent actions. Techniques
    include computational models, sensitivity analysis, and scenario discovery.'
  208: This paper discusses the application of Info-Gap (IG) decision theory to decision-making
    under uncertainty, comparing it with other methods like Robust Decision Making
    (RDM) and robust Bayes. IG is characterized as a method that demands less prior
    information than other methods in most situations, analyzing problems where probability
    distributions would be unknown, or at least uncertain, and when a realistic and
    meaningful worst case cannot be reliably identified.
  209: This paper suggests the use of Info-Gap Robustness (IG) to manage uncertainty
    in policymaking, particularly for policy topics lacking well-accepted scientific
    models.
  223: Info-Gap Robust Design; determining robustness by considering greater levels
    of horizon-of-uncertainty.

    under severe uncertainty, and mentions the use of technology to perform large-scale
    explorations.
  229: The paper illustrates the use of Engineering Options Analysis (EOA) through
    two case studies.
  230: Engineering Options Analysis (EOA) is used to guide infrastructure development

    under a range of uncertainties to identify preferable strategies.
  234: Uses engineering analysis and economies of scale factors to determine the optimal
    plant size for a fixed forecast of LNG demand; compares conventional engineering
    analysis with an approach incorporating modular flexibility and learning rates.
  236: Monte Carlo simulations are used to subject the optimal plant size to 2000
    different future demand scenarios. Compares performance of fixed designs under
    deterministic and uncertain demand.

    for timing and location of capacity expansion, targeting areas of greatest observed
    demand; Comparison of fixed design, flexible design with no move, and flexible
    design with move options.
  240: Multi-criteria analysis comparing fixed and flexible adaptation strategies
    using Monte Carlo simulation to assess performance. Focuses on threshold levels
    of cumulative performance (10% Value at Risk, 90% Value at Gain) rather than absolute
    maxima and minima to provide more stable measures. The analysis includes scenarios
    with and without learning (cost reductions as more modules are implemented).
  241: Engineering Options Analysis (EOA) is used to explore the joint effect of economies
    of scale and learning rates on the desirability of design strategies.
  245: Engineering Options Analysis (EOA) is used to explore different possible designs
    for the replacement of the IJmuiden pumping station. Expert consultation is used
    to determine the sources of uncertainty with the largest potential impact on the
    long-term functionality of the pumping station.
  250: Uses a Physical Performance Module to simulate physical system performance
    under different scenarios, and an Economic Evaluation Module to compare the lifecycle
    costs of different courses of action; lifecycle cost analysis uses Monte Carlo
    simulation to evaluate 1000 different versions of the future for each scenario.
  251: 'Engineering Options Analysis (EOA) to generate distributions of lifecycle
    costs for different designs over simulated futures; comparing three alternative
    strategies: Fixed, Reactive Adaptive, and Proactive Flexible.'
  252: The analysis uses simulation in the EOA (Exploration of Alternatives) framework
    to produce distributions of outcomes, which contrasts with the singular 'value'
    measure of performance produced by standard Real Options Analysis. The results
    are specific to the design alternatives for regulating inland water level under
    the specified scenarios and discount rates.
  253: Engineering Options Analysis (EOA) comparing different design choices (Fixed,
    Reactive Adaptive, Proactive Flexible) for inland water regulation and flood defense
    based on cost-effectiveness under various scenarios.
  254: Exploration of strategies under high sea level scenario using lifecycle costs
    for comparison; Exploration of Options Analysis (EOA).
  255: Engineering Options Analysis (EOA) is used to analyze complex, multi-functional
    systems and identify functionalities that could benefit from a proactive and flexible
    approach. EOA helps structure the analysis of complex systems, providing insights
    into which functionalities could benefit from a proactive and flexible approach
    and which conditions maximize these benefits.
  256: Exploratory Options Analysis (EOA) is presented as a versatile and rigorous
    analytical method, particularly useful when facing immense uncertainty and a lack
    of reliable probabilistic information.
  260: 'Decision Scaling (DS) is presented as a methodology to support decision-making
    under climate uncertainty. It consists of three steps: Decision Framing, Climate
    Stress Test, and Estimating Climate-Informed Risks. It uses weather generator
    tools and systematic sampling algorithms to create an unbiased description of
    system response to plausible climate changes.'
  263: 'DS consists of three steps: Decision Framing, Climate Stress Test, and Estimating
    Climate-Informed Risks.'
  264: DS characterizes climate change projections relative to decisions and revealed
    vulnerabilities, supporting robust decision-making and the quantification of alternative
    adaptations' robustness.
  265: Uses a classic decision analytic framework with Monte Carlo stochastic sampling
    to create a mapping of optimal decisions across a wide range of possible futures,
    independent of any specific climate forecast or expectations of future likelihoods;
    this mapping is then used to identify scenarios where one decision is favored
    over another, revealing what information would be most helpful in selecting one
    decision over another, and to evaluate risks to existing or planned systems.
  268: Stochastic weather generators can be used to produce stochastically generated
    weather time series, maintaining spatial and temporal relationships in aspects
    such as precipitation, temperature, and wind.
  271: Uses a weather generator linked to climate conditions, fed into a hydrologic
    model, which then informs a water resources model. This process is repeated thousands
    of times to sample climate and other changes.
  272: Climate stress tests are performed using stochastically generated weather time
    series to estimate the effects of mean climate changes and variability on system
    performance. The 'climate response surface' summarizes these effects. Multidimensional
    uncertainty analysis may be needed, but 2D visualizations are preferred by stakeholders
    and can be created as slices of the multidimensional surface. Risk is characterized
    by the probability of problematic conditions for a given system.
  274: Climate risk screening to compare alternative plans or evaluate the additional
    robustness of a specific planned adaptation; analysis determines which adaptations
    preserve outcomes above thresholds across future scenarios.
  286: Uses PDFs of regional climate change to determine the risk posed to the CSU
    water system; Employs a climate robustness metric to numerically integrate the
    PDF mass in the region of unacceptable performance; Visualizes the climate response
    surface for the Colorado water utility under varying temperature and precipitation
    scenarios.
  287: This page describes the Decision Scaling (DS) methodology, which uses traditional
    decision analytic methods tailored for climate change uncertainty, and incorporates
    both certain and deeply uncertain factors.
  293: Presents a conceptual model of planned adaptation based on four organizational
    complexes that have effectively implemented it. It identifies where adaptation
    may be introduced in the rulemaking system, categories of events and triggers,
    and evaluative capabilities and capacities. It compares ad hoc, planned, and ideal
    forms of adaptation within a 'systematic adaptation space.' The model will be
    used for theory-based sampling to identify cases of adaptation to refine the model.
  319: Conceptual Model of Planned Adaptation (PA)
  328: The approach 'Adaptive Delta Management' (ADM) was developed, inspired by the
    UK Thames Estuary 2100 programme and the DAPP approach. ADM is adaptive and integrated.
  331: Benefit-cost analysis is used to compare different investment options.
  332: The page describes the establishment of the Second Delta Committee to provide
    advice on long-term planning and climate adaptation.
  336: 'Adaptive Delta Management (ADM) is summarized by four elements: (1) connecting
    short-term decisions in spatial planning with long-term objectives in flood risk
    management, freshwater availability, and spatial planning; (2) developing adaptation
    pathways that visualize measures and conditions under scenarios; (3) choosing
    strategies with flexibility due to uncertainty; (4) linking Delta programme measures
    with other investment agendas.'
  346: The Netherlands' approach to flood risk management has evolved to incorporate
    a risk approach, systematically incorporating population and value of investments
    into the flood safety equation.
  347: Monitoring, analyzing, acting (MAA) system distinguishes three groups of developments
    that may require adjustment of choices and plans. The Signal Group Delta programme
    identifies and discusses external developments that might require adjustments
    of the present strategies.
  366: Robustness is assessed using 'regret' metrics (minimizing maximum regret across
    states of the world) and 'satisficing' metrics (maximizing the number of states
    of the world meeting minimum performance thresholds, such as the 'domain criterion').
  369: Various methodologies for planning and analyzing policies are discussed, including
    Robust Decision Making (RDM), Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP), and Engineering
    Options Analysis (EOA).
  384: The paper discusses the Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act (OODA) loop as a model
    for strategic decision-making in organizations, particularly relevant for public
    policy related to climate change adaptation.
  395: Proposes analytical approaches and tools to handle situations of decision-making
    under deep uncertainty (DMDU), rooted in Assumption-Based Planning (ABP). ABP
    examines the underlying assumptions of an initial policy to protect it from failing.
  397: 'Discusses several Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) approaches:
    Info-Gap (IG), Robust Decision Making (RDM), Dynamic Adaptive Planning (DAP),
    Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP), and Exploratory Optimization Analysis
    (EOA). These methodologies focus on enhancing the robustness of plans in the face
    of uncertainty, either by preventing failure or enhancing adaptivity.'
More Notes:
  5: The book is intended for a broad audience, including students, lecturers, researchers,
    policymakers, and practitioners in the field of decision-making under deep uncertainty.
    It emphasizes guidance in identifying and applying appropriate approaches and
    tools to design policies and advice on implementing these policies in the real
    world, with realistic examples and practical guidelines.
  15: This page focuses primarily on the concept of deep uncertainty in decision-making,
    particularly in the context of climate change and other complex, long-term issues.
    While it doesn't provide specific quantitative analyses of macroeconomic or fiscal
    risks related to climate change adaptation, it frames the challenges in making
    informed decisions due to the inherent uncertainties involved.
  17: Decisionmaking requires an integrated view of alternatives, their consequences,
    and conditions for implementation to achieve objectives.
  21: The paper discusses the concept of 'black swan' events, defined as events that
    are outside the realm of regular expectations, carry an extreme impact, and are
    explainable only after the fact.
  22: The page discusses frameworks for understanding uncertainty in model outputs,
    focusing on assigning probabilities and weights to different potential future
    outcomes. The bell curve image visually represents a probability distribution,
    relevant to understanding risk and uncertainty.
  23: DMDU approaches focus on conditions where traditional predictive methods are
    inadequate due to deep uncertainty and system complexity.
  24: The page presents a figure (Fig. 1.3) that illustrates the choice between short-term
    policy analysis, scenario planning, and DMDU approaches based on the complexity
    of the problem and the level of uncertainty.
  26: The text outlines a cyclical and iterative approach to policy decision-making
    under uncertainty. The circular flowchart visually represents the iterative nature
    of DMDU approaches, and the white space in the middle may suggest the central
    role of ongoing analysis and adaptation.
  28: The methods discussed offer guidance about the process of creating adaptive
    strategies and/or are computational decision support tools capable of generating
    quantitative evidence and insights supporting decisionmaking about different possible
    courses of action.
  35: The page suggests that reliance on predictions and analytical methods requiring
    them can be counter-productive in a fast-changing world, advocating for RDM instead.
  39: This page primarily discusses decision-making frameworks under uncertainty,
    specifically contrasting Robust Decision Making (RDM) with traditional Decision
    Analysis (DA) based on expected utility. While relevant to the broader topic of
    assessing climate change risks and adaptation benefits, it doesn't directly quantify
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  50: The agent-based representation represents key factors potentially important
    to technology diffusion.
  73: The analysis focuses on maintaining Schiphol's market share, managing noise
    complaints, and maintaining its competitive position in terms of capacity. The
    impact of climate change appears to be limited to effects of development of wind
    conditions.
  74: No relevant information
  75: The scenario involves airport planning, but the general framework of monitoring
    triggers and actions could be applied to other macroeconomic and macro-fiscal
    contexts related to climate change adaptation. The focus is on adapting a plan
    to different demand, capacity, and environmental scenarios through staged investments
    and policy adjustments.
  81: Multiple pathways are visualized in a metro map or decision tree, with time
    or changing conditions on one of the axes.
  82: The DAPP approach aims to be less scenario-dependent by focusing on identifying
    the conditions under which a policy will fail, allowing for more flexible and
    adaptive planning.
  83: The approach emphasizes monitoring for signals that indicate when the next step
    of a pathway should be implemented or if a reassessment is needed.
  86: The page describes a general framework for adaptation planning but lacks specifics
    on the macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes being considered or quantitative analysis.
    Fig. 4.2 and 4.3 are referenced but not described in detail, so their content
    is unknown.
  90: Historical data suggests an average of 29 non-navigable days per year in the
    past 25 years leading to significant economic risks.
  91: No specific economic costs or benefits of adaptation provided on this page.
  92: The costs are based on the situation in the Netherlands, which might limit the
    transferability of the cost figures to other countries. The table only provides
    costs, not benefits, which limits its usefulness for cost-benefit analysis. The
    box plot shows the number of years it takes to reach an ATP based on policy choice.
  93: The analysis considers the flexibility and robustness of different pathways,
    aiming to avoid locked-in situations and unnecessary upfront costs.
  94: The Pathways Generator image shows various scenarios related to ships and dredging
    over time but it is not related to macroeconomic/macrofiscal outcomes. The table
    indicates the different possible pathways are numbered and labelled with some
    kind of label (e.g. /barb4right). It is unclear what management option each pathway
    indicates.
  98: Economic evaluation of pathways developed using DAPP is not straightforward,
    and is sensitive to variations in the discount rate and the timing of tipping
    points.  Studies into appropriate monitoring signals are at a nascent stage.
  115: The robustness function demonstrates trade-off and zeroing properties. The
    trade-off between robustness and performance is illustrated by a downward-sloping
    curve. Zeroing indicates that the robustness becomes zero at the best-estimate
    prediction.
  118: The analysis explores the trade-offs between robustness (avoiding worst-case
    scenarios) and opportuneness (capitalizing on best-case scenarios) under uncertainty.
  119: The robustness function is used to evaluate each option, and the robustness
    curves can cross, indicating a trade-off between performance and robustness. The
    robustness curves quantify the performance of different options under various
    levels of uncertainty.
  123: The quantitative analysis of robustness and opportuneness of large and complicated
    systems often faces algorithmic or numerical difficulties resulting from high
    dimensionality of the computations.
  132: The decision-making under deep uncertainty (DMDU) community refers to the assessment
    of different possible courses of action across diverse future conditions as Exploratory
    Modeling.
  134: The threshold values used in EOA are similar to 'triggers' or 'adaptation tipping
    points' used in other DMDU (Decision Making Under Deep Uncertainty) approaches.
  144: Water utilities are adapting to climate change by incorporating new technologies,
    integrating natural features with built systems, and exploring market-based solutions.
  150: The study analyzes alternative water management portfolios to reduce vulnerabilities,
    including options like municipal and industrial conservation, agricultural conservation,
    wastewater reuse, and desalination. The framing is organized as an XLRM (Exogenous
    factors, Policy Levers, Relationships, Measures of performance) matrix.
  152: The effectiveness and cost of different water management portfolios vary significantly.
    Stakeholder acceptance influences the choice of portfolio.
  153: The analysis explores different investment signposts and triggers to represent
    stakeholders and planners with different preferences for cost and reliability.
    The Baseline strategy uses the signposts and triggers used for the Basin Study
    portfolios.
  158: The visual displays different adaptation strategies with reference to the probability
    of scenarios happening; these strategies are, in order from least to most, Current
    Management, Basin Study Triggers, Moderate, Moderately Aggressive, Aggressive,
    Very Aggressive, and Static Implement-All-Actions. If the probability of a Severely
    Declining Supply scenario is high enough, all of these strategies are insufficient.
  161: 'The EDIAM framework depends on three main mechanisms: R&D investments, technology
    evolution in advanced and emerging regions, and the determination of the optimal
    policy response for mitigating climate change. Five forces determine the direction
    of R&D: direct productivity effect, price effect, market size effect, experience
    effect, and innovation propensity effect. In the emerging region, innovative activity
    is focused on closing the technological gap through imitation and adaptation of
    foreign technologies. The speed and scope of development is determined by R&D
    returns, innovation propensity, and innovation transferability.'
  163: The paper uses a model with seven policies (P2 and P7 explicitly discussed
    on this page) and examines their vulnerabilities in meeting the two-degree temperature
    target under different uncertainty scenarios.
  172: The workshop involved stakeholders likely to participate in the ISA planning
    process in the Netherlands and was conducted in a computer-supported group decision
    room.
  176: The authors chose DAP due to deep uncertainties surrounding ISA implementation
    and the availability of new approaches for dealing with deep uncertainty.
  180: The process includes defining goals, selecting a basic plan, assessing its
    strengths and weaknesses, identifying uncertain and important factors, defining
    actions for robustness, and establishing signposts and triggers for future adaptation
    actions, tested via wildcard scenarios.
  189: This page focuses on the methodology of developing adaptive plans, particularly
    in the context of Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) technology. It does not directly
    address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks of climate change or provide quantitative
    cost-benefit analyses of adaptation at a national level.
  206: This page primarily provides biographical information about the authors and
    information regarding Creative Commons licensing.
  208: The paper emphasizes that info-gap applies to a wide range of contexts, not
    just computational physics and engineering. It uses the example of the design
    of a mechanical latch to illustrate the components of an IG analysis.
  209: The paper contrasts the precautionary principle (early intervention despite
    scientific uncertainty) with the scientific design of intervention (longer-range
    planning with emphasis on gaining better understanding and reducing uncertainty).
  223: The robustness function expresses the trade-off between greater requirements
    and robustness. Truncation error can affect the robustness function.
  225: The 'cost of robustness' is lower for the variant geometry than the nominal
    geometry, indicating a more efficient trade-off between robustness and performance
    requirement.
  229: The page outlines two case studies where EOA is applied, one for liquid natural
    gas plant development and another for water management and flood control facilities.
    Both case studies emphasize the importance of monitoring projects and adapting
    to future developments.
  230: EOA views projects as a series of possible actions over time and space, emphasizing
    wise first steps that allow for flexibility as uncertainty resolves.
  234: "The \"learning phenomenon\" reduces costs compared to large units, similar\
    \ to the time value of money. Analysis looks at economies of scale factors, from\
    \ \u03B1=1.0 to \u03B1=0.85"
  236: The study highlights the discrepancy between deterministic and uncertainty
    analyses, emphasizing the importance of considering uncertainty in adaptation
    planning. The nonlinearity of the system, inherent in cost structure and demand
    variations, is a crucial aspect.
  238: The flexible strategy stochastically dominates the fixed design. The fixed
    design, while taking advantage of economies of scale, can lead to large losses
    if sufficient demand doesn't materialize and cannot serve demands exceeding its
    fixed capacity.
  239: The analysis considers both timing and location flexibility in capacity expansion;
    The flexibility to 'move' capacity refers to locational flexibility.
  241: "The analysis considers different learning rates (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%)\
    \ and economies of scale factors (\u03B1, ranging from 0.85 to 1). Figure 11.6\
    \ illustrates the impact of different learning rates on the Net Present Value\
    \ (NPV) for a flexible modular design, while Figure 11.7 illustrates how the value\
    \ of flexibility changes with different economies of scale and learning rates."
  250: The Rijkswaterstaat uses the 5.5% discount rate for capital investment projects.
  251: 'The analysis focuses on a specific case study: the IJmuiden Pumping Station.
    The results are specific to the function of inland water level regulation on the
    North Sea Canal.'
  252: The value of options (like the Proactive Flexible design) grows as the degree
    of uncertainty about the future increases, suggesting that design choice is highly
    sensitive to the perceived level of climate change uncertainty.
  253: The analysis uses a 5.5% discount rate for the high sea level rise scenario.
    Foundation costs are a key determinant of capital costs for flood defense. Discount
    rate significantly reduces the present value of distant extra costs.
  254: Decision-makers can choose between minimizing average cost (Reactive Adaptive)
    or reducing the possible range of outcomes (Fixed or Proactive Flexible); For
    flood defense, the benefits of the Reactive Adaptive design might not justify
    its risks.
  255: EOA allows for deferring details of a strategy until more information about
    the relevant factors (e.g., market conditions, government intentions, sea level
    rise) is available. EOA can cope with diverse and deep uncertainties.
  265: The approach aims to address the challenges of multiple, potentially conflicting
    climate projections and divergent stakeholder beliefs by creating a decision-making
    framework that is independent of any particular set of future climate scenarios.
  271: The process is referred to as Exploratory Modeling (EM) in the rest of the
    book. The determination of threshold levels is flexible and can be specified by
    the analyst.
  272: The analysis is designed to be free of probabilities for particular scenarios
    initially, allowing exploration of decision space before risk characterization.
  274: The analysis is conditional on the assumed probability distribution; categories
    allow information to be conveyed in terms meaningful for decisionmakers.
  275: The study focused on water supply reliability for Colorado Springs, a specific
    utility, and did not evaluate alternative investments to address vulnerabilities,
    so it may not have a direct bearing on a macroeconomic or macro-fiscal review
    at the national level.
  286: The analysis focuses on a specific water utility (CSU) and may not be directly
    generalizable to nation-wide macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks, but it offers
    a methodology for risk assessment under climate change scenarios by creating a
    visualization of climate scenarios which can lead to system failure and using
    this to quantify the probability of failure.
  319: Decoupling of monitoring, knowledge creation, and knowledge assessment from
    a potentially politicized rulemaking organization may be needed.
  321: This page is a conceptual discussion about planned adaptation and does not
    contain specific macroeconomic or macro-fiscal analysis.
  331: The paper suggests that a series of sectoral interventions will not be sufficient
    to address climate change impacts, and integrated cross-cutting approach is required.
  332: The Second Delta Committee was focused on ensuring the Netherlands remains
    a viable place for living and business without displacing to higher grounds.
  334: The Delta Programme Commissioner's role contributes to depoliticization and
    continuity in water policy.
  336: The working process for developing the ADM approach involved experts from research
    institutes and responsible departments to create a state-of-the-art, easily applicable
    approach with commitment from policymakers. The Delta programme used an organizational
    complex with a Coregroup for ADM, a Strategy Working Group, and a Research Coordinator.
  342: Incremental adaptation measures, while protective in the short term, may increase
    sunk costs and transfer costs, raising the threshold for switching to transformational
    strategies. Middle-term resilience investments should be re-evaluated considering
    a possible future transition to a significantly modified system. Shorter depreciation
    periods or alternative short-term measures can be considered.
  346: 'Mentions the importance of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems for adaptive
    strategies and lists goals for M&E set by the National Steering Group Delta programme:
    generating information on external conditions, fueling learning processes, and
    providing a basis for external justification of budget and energy spent.'
  384: The paper highlights the difficulty of making the OODA approach operational
    in public policy and contrasts it with current processes which are often based
    on tacitly agreed fictions and limitations. The Netherlands' approach to climate
    and hydraulics is noted as a place where monitoring is emphasized.
  386: This page focuses on the disconnect between analysts and policymakers and how
    to bridge that gap to improve policy decisions. It does not directly address macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal risks of climate change or the costs/benefits of adaptation, but
    it may be relevant in ensuring that policy decisions and analysis regarding climate
    change can be properly integrated.
  395: The page introduces the concept of Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU)
    and Assumption-Based Planning (ABP) as relevant approaches for dealing with situations
    where uncertainties cannot be eliminated and ignoring them can lead to negative
    consequences or missed opportunities.
  397: The paper discusses how 'plausible futures' are considered and depend on expectations,
    understanding of the system, and people's values. It also notes that acceptability
    of a policy depends on people's values.
