Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Mean annual temperatures in South Africa have increased by at least 1.5 times\
    \ the observed global average of 0.65\xB0C over the past five decades; extreme\
    \ rainfall events have increased in frequency."
  2: "Warming of 3\u20136\xB0C by 2081\u20132100 in the interior of South Africa (relative\
    \ to 1986-2005) is suggested by IPCC AR5 for RCP 8.5, with uncertain precipitation\
    \ changes."
  3: Range of emission scenarios, uncertainty in precipitation projections, 'Hot-Dry',
    'Hot-Wet', 'Warm-Dry' and 'Warm-Wet' future climate scenarios, local and remote
    ocean drivers of rainfall variability.
Highlights:
  1: South Africa has a well-developed earth system science research program; national
    government has developed a National Climate Change Response White Paper; a national
    process to scope long-term adaptation scenarios is underway.
  2: South Africa is focusing on integrated development trajectories to reduce vulnerability
    to current and future climate variability and change.
  3: The Long Term Adaptation Scenarios (LTAS) project in South Africa aimed to develop
    national and sub-national adaptation scenarios. LTAS represents the first common,
    dynamical as well as statistical suite of high-resolution projections for South
    Africa, as well as a comparison between two generations of global climate models,
    resulting in an ensemble of 78 individual projections. MIT climate scenarios were
    included to quantify economic impacts of climate change at the national scale.
  7: Adaptation planning in the biodiversity sector has incorporated climate change
    impacts scenarios into national plans for expansion of protected areas. In the
    agricultural sector, farmers are adapting to historical changes, for example,
    apple orchards have been replaced by vineyards. A short-term insurance company
    noticed increasing insurance claims associated with extreme weather events and
    embarked on a pilot project to assess landscape-wide measures to reduce such risks.
    Local adaptation strategies have been developed for some cities and municipalities.
Methodology:
  1: Review of current approaches and recent advances in research on climate impacts
    and adaptation in South Africa; integrated assessments of climate change to support
    climate-resilient development planning.
  2: "The Long Term Adaptation Scenarios (LTAS) process pulls together much of South\
    \ Africa\u2019s existing climate science and impacts work and offers new analysis\
    \ that highlights ways in which the country should be approaching climate adaptation\
    \ in the context of its development priorities. First phase reports for comment\
    \ released in mid 2013, and the second phase will be finalized during 2014."
  3: Downscaling approaches from CSAG and CSIR using CMIP3 and CMIP5 data and SRES
    and RCP emissions scenarios. Development of national and sub-national adaptation
    scenarios. Use of four contrasting scenarios (Hot-Dry, Hot-Wet, Warm-Dry and Warm-Wet)
    for South Africa to capture spread of results from different climate models.
More Notes:
  1: Further research is needed on the climate impacts on cities and the built environment;
    the National Climate Change Response White Paper has yet to translate into policy
    that mainstreams adaptation; institutional challenges persist in implementing
    adaptation responses; knowledge gaps remain in relation to the biophysical and
    socio-economic impacts of climate change.
  3: The inherent uncertainty in the LTAS climate projection data is an aspect that
    has yet to be robustly examined. Scientists engaged in vulnerability and impacts
    assessments will need to consider a wider range of potential climate scenarios
    to assess risk fully.
