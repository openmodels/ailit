Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global climate change affecting water availability, steady growth of water demand.
  2: Climate change impacts on water resources, population growth, rapid economic
    development, and increasing water demand from irrigation, livestock, domestic,
    industrial and energy sectors.
  4: Potential water shortages for thermal power plants in water-stressed areas affect
    operational stability, impacting energy production.
  6: Increased water demand from irrigation, domestic use, industry, livestock, and
    energy, coupled with changes in water availability.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change will lead to water stress affecting thermal power generation in
    the Ganges sub-basins, potentially endangering energy security in India. Relocation
    of power plants and adoption of less water-intensive technologies are recommended.
  2: Water stress assessment at the district level can be used as effective information
    supporting thermal power generation planning and site selection; 40% of existing
    and planned thermal power plants in Damodar and almost all in Gandak and Yamuna
    are located in water-stressed or moderately water-stressed areas which will face
    high water risks in the future.
  4: Potential impacts on the operational stability of power plants in water-stressed
    areas; water abundant areas are suitable for new energy project development.
  6: Yamuna sub-basin will face severe water deficit in the future, particularly due
    to high irrigation and domestic water demand. Chambal will have the largest water
    surplus among the four sub-basins. Many districts in Gandak will face water stress
    in 2050 compared to 2010. Existing and planned thermal power plants located in
    the water-stressed areas will face high risks.
Methodology:
  1: Integrated assessment of the water-energy nexus in the Ganges sub-basins focusing
    on water stress assessment for thermal power plants up to 2050 under climate change
    conditions (RCP4.5).
  2: Hydrological modelling for water deficit in 2050; assessment of climate-induced
    long-term water availability in the Ganges Basin and the Impacts on Energy Security
    in South Asia, applicable up to 2050.
  4: The study uses the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to project future water
    demand and availability under climate change scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 from
    2020-2050, and assesses the water supply-demand balance for energy and non-energy
    sectors.
  6: Water stress is assessed based on the ratios of supply-demand balance, defined
    as the difference between total water availability and total water demand divided
    by the total water availability. The study projects future water demand up to
    2050.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the India case study only.
  2: The paper focuses on the water-energy nexus in the Ganges basin and its implications
    for energy security in India. The study was funded by the Asia-Pacific Network
    for Global Change Research (APN).
  4: The study includes a water-energy nexus assessment and provides spatial visualization
    tools for water demand and supply.
  6: The paper focuses on water stress in specific river basins in India and its potential
    impact on various sectors including agriculture, energy, and domestic use. No
    specific macro or fiscal impact is quantified, but the water stress assessment
    serves as a proxy for potential economic and social risks.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Water stress for thermal power generation impacting energy security in India.
  2: Potential impacts on energy security (thermal power generation) and agricultural
    livelihoods due to water stress.
  4: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, costs, or benefits of nation-wide
    adaptation are discussed.
  6: Water stress levels are assessed, which can impact various sectors and potentially
    affect GDP through reduced agricultural output, industrial production, or energy
    generation.
Quantitative material:
  1: Water availability in Chambal, Damodar, Gandak and Yamuna will increase by 13%,
    33%, 21% and 28%, respectively, in 2050 compared with 2010 under RCP4.5. Yamuna
    will have 25% less water in the dry season in the 2050s. 30 out of 40 districts
    in Yamuna and 18 out of 33 districts in Gandak will face serious water deficit
    in 2050 under RCP 4.5. 40% of thermal power plants in Damodar and almost all in
    Gandak and Yamuna will face high water risks.
  2: Water availability in Chambal, Damodar, Gandak and Yamuna will increase by 13%,
    33%, 21% and 28%, respectively, in 2050; total water demand will increase steadily
    ranging from 34% (in Damodar) to 42% (in Yamuna); 18 out of 33 districts in Gandak
    and 30 out of 40 districts in Yamuna will face severe water deficit in 2050; Approximately
    8% of globally withdrawn water is used for energy generation; more than 40% of
    the total thermal power capacity is in Ganges region.
  4: No quantitative information on specific economic outcomes of interest.
  6: Water demand estimations (MCM) for different sub-basins (Chambal, Damodar, Gandak,
    Gomti, Yamuna) in 2010, 2030, and 2050, broken down by sector (irrigation, domestic,
    industry, livestock, energy, environmental). Water stress is assessed based on
    the ratio of supply-demand balance.
