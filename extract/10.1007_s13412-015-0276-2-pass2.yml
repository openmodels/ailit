Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change; population growth; decline from state-owned strategic grain reserves
    in favor of market-oriented approaches dominated by corporations.
  6: Fluctuations in global cereal reserves (carry-over stocks), grain deficits
  8: Low levels of cereal stocks.
  11: No relevant information
  12: Global cereal stock variation
  17: Food stock levels are negatively correlated with food prices in the periods
    1991-2000 and 1995-2005.
  18: Over-production and collapsing grain prices; Drought and other calamities leading
    to food shortages
  20: Drought, crop failure, soaring prices on local markets, corruption and mismanagement,
    policy shifts (e.g., IMF-encouraged reduction in reserve size).
Highlights:
  2: Food storage has fallen in and out of favor, criticized for being expensive yet
    often shown to play an important role in protecting poor consumers in times of
    food crisis. Data on corporate food storage are proprietary, making it impossible
    to assess food system resilience.
  6: Low grain reserves may have been a factor in driving up prices in 2008. Between
    1991 and 2005 there was an inverse relation between grain reserves and price.
  8: Low cereal stocks in 2007-8 were significant contributors to the 2008 price spike.
  11: No relevant information
  17: Food stocks are negatively correlated with food prices in some periods. The
    volatility of global grain stocks appears to be increasing over time (as indicated
    by the increasing coefficient of variance).
  18: The US 'ever-normal granary' policy from the 1930s aimed to support farm prices
    and ensure affordable food for consumers through government-managed grain reserves.
  20: Strategic grain reserves in Africa were intended to address market failures,
    stabilize prices, and prepare for food emergencies. However, corruption, mismanagement,
    and policy shifts (like structural adjustment programs) have undermined their
    effectiveness. The Malawi case highlights the risks of reducing reserve size under
    pressure from international institutions.
  23: The paper concludes with a call for more research on the need for household
    and food supply chain storage to promote resilience.
Methodology:
  2: Historical analysis (ancient Rome and China); review of food storage and price
    volatility in the last 20 years; exploration of different grain reserve policies
    (US, EU, Africa).
  6: Analysis of FAO data on year-end stocks (calculated by adding annual production
    to previous year-end stocks and subtracting yearly utilization and waste). Examines
    correlations between grain reserves and the UN's food price index.
  11: No relevant information
  17: Regression analysis to determine the relationship between food prices and food
    stock. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variance)
    are calculated for global grain stocks. The regression results are only applicable
    during the time periods specified.
  20: Case study analysis of strategic grain reserves in Africa, particularly focusing
    on the Malawi famine of 2001.
More Notes:
  2: The paper calls for more research to evaluate the scale at which food storage
    systems should be implemented and mechanisms to govern and manage them.
  6: FAO data does not assess who owns these stocks nor how they are managed. Data
    on grain reserves collected by the United Nations is incomplete, and does not
    include household-level food storage or the food held in grocery retail warehouses
    etc.
  8: The USDA's Farm Storage Facility Loan Program incentivizes increased storage
    of commodities, which could buffer against price spikes related to low stocks.
  11: The FAO data may be relevant to understanding the macroeconomic risk of climate
    change, however, this page provides no information directly contributing to that
    understanding.
  12: The relationship between cereal stock and food price index is visually presented,
    suggesting a potential link between agricultural production and food prices. This
    is relevant to the review because food prices can influence macroeconomic outcomes
    such as inflation, and fiscal outcomes related to social safety nets and food
    subsidies.
  18: The policy was cancelled in the 1970s in favor of free market deregulation of
    agriculture.
No relevant information:
  4: This page primarily discusses the historical context of food storage and its
    relation to societal stability, focusing on pre-industrial times and ancient civilizations.
    It does not contain any information about specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes,
    quantitative data on the costs and benefits of adaptation at a national level,
    or the methodologies used to analyze such outcomes in the context of climate change.
  13: No relevant information
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Food price volatility; food security; economic shocks impacting food systems.
  6: Food prices, global food supplies
  8: Availability and level of food reserves (corn, soybean, wheat) affect food prices,
    potentially leading to price spikes (as seen in 2007-8).
  11: No relevant information
  12: Food price index
  17: Food prices.
  18: The program aimed to stabilize farm incomes and consumer food prices.
  20: Potentially reduced vulnerability of population groups during food emergencies
    through strategic grain reserves, but also potential negative impacts on budget
    balance and borrowing costs due to maintenance of reserves.
Quantitative material:
  2: The size of food stores (and in particular grain reserves) directly relates to
    price volatility (based on data from the last 20 years).
  6: Global reserves for cereals have generally ranged between 400 and 600 million
    tonnes annually, which is between 18% and 23% of total annual food use. Lowest
    level since the early 1990s was 18.4% in 2007-8, largest stock was in 2013-14
    at 23.3% of utilization.
  8: Corn and soybean stores have grown by about 50% since the early 1990s in the
    US.

    cereal utilization (Source: FAO, 2014)'
  12: Figure 2 shows global cereal stock variation (left axis) and food price index
    (right axis). The source is FAO, 2014.
  17: Table 1 contains rice stock data for major rice exporting countries from 2005-2011.
    Table 2 contains regression analysis results for food price as the dependent variable
    and food stock as the explanatory variable in four different time periods. Table
    3 shows the mean, SD and CV for global grain stocks in four year intervals between
    2003 and 2014.
