Highlights:
  2: Climate feedbacks alone account for a relatively minor increase in SCCO2 compared
    to other updates in the PAGE-ICE model. Economy feedbacks result in a manifold
    increase in the SCCO2. Higher damages in the Global South are almost entirely
    responsible for the increase in SCCO2 due to both economy feedbacks and other
    updates since PAGE09. Interannual temperature variability increases the width
    of the SCCO2 distribution.
  3: The paper aims to quantify the effect on the SCCO2 of including possible long-term
    temperature growth feedback on economic trajectories, mean annual temperature
    anomalies, and already modeled permafrost carbon and surface albedo feedbacks,
    and to provide an indication of the magnitude and uncertainties of climate and
    economy feedbacks and interannual variability to the SCCO2.
  4: PAGE-ICE includes a more detailed representation of CO2 and CH4 sinks, permafrost
    carbon feedback, the effect of sea ice and land snow decline on surface albedo,
    and a fat-tailed distribution of sea level rise. The market damages are calculated
    based on absolute temperature. Persistent climate-induced damages are included,
    which affects GDP pathways and scales emissions accordingly.
  5: Models annual temperature variability as constant over time, based on analysis
    of regional means.
  6: The mean SCCO2 for PAGE-ICE is double the value for PAGE09. This increase can
    be attributed almost entirely to increased social costs in the Global South. Introducing
    empirically derived level of damage persistence affects both the size of global
    GDP and its regional distribution by vast amounts, dominating the effect of any
    other modeling choice.
  7: Damage persistence leads to a considerable redistribution of income to the detriment
    of poorer regions. High levels of damage persistence can cause economic contraction
    in the Global South and increase the risk of regions reaching extreme poverty.
    The SCCO2 is highly sensitive to damage persistence, with even a small amount
    of persistence leading to a significant increase in the SCCO2.
  8: Adaptation reducing damage persistence can significantly reduce the model's SCCO2.
    High persistence and low/no adaptation lead to a substantial share of Monte Carlo
    runs producing SCCO2 estimates of zero due to the damage cap.
  9: Interannual temperature variability widens the tails of the SCCO2 distributions.
    Temperature variability interacts with the temperature-damage function used for
    market damages.
  10: The persistence of economic damages significantly impacts SCCO2 estimates; including
    temperature anomalies increases uncertainty; economic impacts in the Global South
    may be underestimated.
  11: Larger CO2 pulses, while not truly marginal, provide more stable SCCO2 estimates
    compared to smaller pulses which are too variable.
  13: A one standard deviation decrease in the tolerable temperature before a discontinuity
    occurs can trigger the discontinuity, leading to a substantial increase in the
    SCCO2.
  14: A one standard deviation decrease in the tolerable temperature before discontinuity
    (tdis_tolerabilitydisc) leads to a substantial increase in SCCO2 by $617.53.
  16: SCCO2 estimates vary significantly depending on the SSP scenario and PAGE model
    configuration. The inclusion of growth effects can substantially increase SCCO2
    estimates.
  17: The analysis emphasizes the sensitivity of total damage estimates to the levels
    of equity weighting and implements thresholds to prevent infinite equity-weighted
    damages.
  18: The paper discusses how lagged effects of temperature shocks can influence the
    overall impact on economic growth, with positive coefficients indicating compensation
    and negative coefficients indicating exacerbated damages.
  19: The persistence of climate damages on economic growth is estimated, finding
    that it varies significantly based on the number of temperature lags included
    in the regression model, and also based on the methodology employed. More lags
    lead to lower persistence estimates, but also wider confidence intervals.
  20: The table presents coefficients indicating the impact of temperature on GDP
    per capita growth, with significant positive and negative associations depending
    on the temperature measure and lag.
  21: "The figure shows the effect of the damage persistence parameter \u03C1 on regional\
    \ GDP levels for different model years."
  22: 5-year filtered temperature coefficients remain statistically significant, with
    reduced probability of zero persistence.
  23: Temperature and temperature squared are statistically significant predictors
    of GDP per capita growth when unfiltered or with a 3-year filter. The statistical
    significance diminishes with longer filters.
  24: "Estimates of persistence (\u03C1) are calculated for temperature shocks on\
    \ GDPpc growth in lower-income countries."
  25: The paper finds that temperature increases can have persistent economic impacts,
    with the persistence being more significant in regions with lower GDP per capita.
  27: The impact of varying decay rates of damage persistence on SCCO2 estimate under
    SSP2-4.5 is illustrated in figure B9; High decay rates of damage persistence greatly
    reduce the estimated marginal damages of CO2 emissions.
  28: The study finds strongly positive changes in interannual temperature variability
    over the tropics, especially Amazonia, with little increase in variability over
    Europe. No global or PAGE-ICE region-specific evidence was found to justify increasing
    or decreasing temperature variability with rising global temperatures.
  29: Controlling for either a smoothed GMST predictor or an auto-regressive term
    reduces average correlation of the residuals across regions by half, compared
    to the correlation across regions in the raw temperatures.
  31: USA shows a significant coefficient of 1.182 for GMST, indicating a strong relationship
    with regional temperature changes.
Methodology:
  2: The study uses the PAGE-ICE model and compares it to the PAGE09 model. It also
    extends PAGE-ICE with economy feedbacks and includes an estimate of interannual
    temperature variability.
  3: The paper extends the PAGE-ICE CB-IAM model to quantify the effect on SCCO2 of
    long-term temperature growth feedback on economic trajectories, mean annual temperature
    anomalies, and permafrost carbon and surface albedo feedbacks. The model simulates
    climatic and economic developments between 2020 and 2300.
  4: "Uses the PAGE-ICE model, which has been translated into the Mimi modeling framework.\
    \ Runs the model twice, once with an emission pathway and once with an added CO2\
    \ pulse. SCCO2 is calculated as the difference in global equity-weighted damages\
    \ between the two runs, discounted to the base year (2015). Equity weighting uses\
    \ a mean elasticity of marginal utility of consumption of 1.17 (0.1\u20132.0),\
    \ and a pure time preference rate of 1.03% (0.5%, 2.0%). Model setup recognizes\
    \ that deterministic assessments of the SCCO2 carry only very limited information,\
    \ and instead provides distributions of the results using Monte Carlo sampling."
  5: The PAGE model is used to calculate damages on an annual basis using annualized
    temperatures. Annualized temperatures are calculated with a combination of exponential
    interpolation for population, sea-level rise, and abatement costs, and linear
    interpolation for GDP growth rates. The model allows for persistence of damages.
    Parameters are fitted to historical temperatures using least-squares regression
    and LOESS.
  6: Monte Carlo simulations were performed to estimate the SCCO2. Panel regression
    analysis was used to estimate the persistence of economic damages based on historical
    temperature and GDP data.
  7: The PAGE-ICE model is used to incorporate growth effects into climate damage
    assessments under the SSP2-RCP4.5 scenario. Monte Carlo simulations are performed
    to assess the impact of damage persistence on GDP and SCCO2. The analysis considers
    fixed degrees of persistence from 0% to 100% and an empirically derived persistence
    distribution.
  8: Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the effect of adaptation on reducing
    damage persistence. The PAGE-ICE model is used with a damage cap. Analysis considers
    different persistence and adaptation rates. Historical data are used to derive
    temperature-induced economic damages and persistence, implicitly assuming future
    adaptation will remain at levels observed hitherto.
  9: The analysis uses the PAGE model and Monte Carlo simulations to assess the impact
    of interannual temperature variability on climate damages. Results are applicable
    to climate and socioeconomic scenarios, specifically looking at the SSP2-4.5 scenario.
  10: The analysis uses the PAGE-ICE model to assess the impact of temperature anomalies
    and damage persistence on SCCO2, emphasizing variability and extremes in climate
    models.
  11: The PAGE model runs from mid-2017 to 2025 using an exogenous emission scenario
    with a CO2 pulse size considered for 2020.
  13: The analysis uses the PAGE-ICE model for SSP2-4.5 (deterministic run). The SCCO2
    impact is calculated as the difference between the SCCO2 for the mean of the parameter's
    Monte Carlo distribution and the SCCO2 for a parameter value equal to the mean
    value increased (or decreased) by one standard deviation, while all other parameters
    remain at their default value. Only parameters with an absolute SCCO2 impact of
    at least $10 are displayed.
  14: The analysis uses the PAGE-ICE model for SSP2-4.5 in a deterministic run, calculating
    changes in SCCO2 from variations in parameters with all others at default values.
  16: "Uses the PAGE model with Monte Carlo simulations to estimate SCCO2. Incorporates\
    \ regional temperatures that vary independently, observational uncertainties,\
    \ and a persistence parameter (\u03C1) to link damages to GDP growth. Introduces\
    \ a subsistence bound at the World Bank's extreme poverty level to avoid infinite\
    \ equity-weighted damages. The analysis is applicable to various SSP scenarios."
  17: Equity-weighted damage calculation is highlighted, with adjustments for regions
    approaching the subsistence consumption level; damage thresholds trigger logistic
    convergence paths to avoid numeric infeasibility.
  18: "Fixed effects regressions are used to model economic growth as a function of\
    \ temperature and other variables. The model includes country fixed effects (\u03B1\
    i) and time fixed effects (\u03B4t)."
  19: Estimates damage persistence as the ratio of long-run to immediate marginal
    impacts as the temperature goes to (minus) infinity, based on a lagged regression
    model. An alternative approach using a Butterworth low-pass filter on climate
    variables is also explored.
  20: The analysis uses baseline regression models with temperature and precipitation
    lags, country and year fixed effects, and country-specific trends.
  21: Monte Carlo simulations are run using SSP2-4.5 scenarios. 5000 bootstrap samples
    are created by drawing with replacement from country clusters.
  22: Persistence estimation is repeated for two groups of countries (rich and poor)
    based on 1980 GDP per capita.
  23: Regression analysis using Burke et al. (2015) data with low-pass filtered climate
    variables. Bootstrap sampling is used to estimate percentiles. Analysis is repeated
    for income-based subsamples (above and below median PPP).
  24: Regression model with country and year fixed effects, and country-specific time
    trends. The model is based on Burke et al. (2015) and applied to countries with
    GDPpc below the median. Temperature lags are considered up to 5 years.  Bootstrapping
    is used to estimate uncertainty.
  25: The analysis uses a baseline regression model with temperature and precipitation
    lags, country and year fixed effects, and country-specific time trends, following
    the methodology by Burke et al. (2015).
  27: Monte Carlo simulations under different annual decay rates of damage persistence
    for SSP2-4.5; Historical temperature data is used to calibrate the estimate of
    damage persistence and extrapolate it into the distant future; Interannual temperature
    variability computed as the long-term average of the 11 year standard deviations
    after detrending the annual temperature anomaly data using a local 11 year running
    mean.
  28: Annual standard deviations of detrended temperatures are calculated over 11-year
    periods. A 30-year running window is used for linear detrending. Temperature data
    is spatially aggregated for PAGE-ICE regions using a land-sea mask and cosine
    of latitude weighting. An autoregressive temperature model is also used, decomposing
    temperature variability into autocorrelation, trends, and random variability using
    regional temperature data.
  29: Regional temperatures are calculated using a normal distribution, amplification
    factors, and autoregression based on global temperatures and PAGE regions.
  31: Analysis uses an autoregressive model by region to evaluate relationships between
    regional temperature and GMST.
More Notes:
  3: The paper compares the PAGE-ICE CB-IAM with PAGE09 and attributes the changes
    in the SCCO2 to the specific model changes.
  4: The model includes interannual temperature variability with a temperature feedback
    through annual auto-correlation. The PAGE-ICE discontinuity damage component was
    reduced to correspond with updates to climate tipping points and sea-level rise
    risk. Economic damages due to rising temperatures are recalibrated based on historic
    data and capture the heterogeneous response of countries to warming.
  5: The paper implements a persistence parameter for economic damages, allowing for
    different levels of persistence, including no persistence and full persistence.
    The paper rescales greenhouse gas emissions proportionally to changes in GDP.
    Sea level rise damages depend on global mean temperatures, not annual temperatures.
  6: Interaction effects mean changing the order in which changes are introduced can
    lead to minor changes in the values presented.
  7: The model caps total climate change damages, which can lead to a decrease in
    the SCCO2 at high levels of persistence because an additional tonne of CO2 will
    not increase overall damages.
  9: The analysis considers both PAGE09, PAGE-ICE, and PAGE models with and without
    growth effects and interannual variability.
  13: The annual model reports SCCO2 distributions that differ from the original model
    due to changes in the discontinuity sector and the model design of PAGE09 where
    each time step year covers half of the time to the next analysis year.
  16: "Some SCCO2 distributions include values of zero due to damages being outside\
    \ the model's scope or numerical issues in extreme Monte Carlo draws. The paper\
    \ limits equity weighting to damages less than or equal to 99% of consumption.\
    \ The persistence of damages is modeled using a parameter \u03C1, which specifies\
    \ the share of economic damages that affect the growth rate."
  18: The paper uses both linear and quadratic temperature terms in the regression
    models.
  19: "The ratio of marginal impacts (long-run to immediate) approaches infinity around\
    \ 13\xB0C, making aggregation of this ratio across temperatures problematic. The\
    \ paper acknowledges a bias-variance tradeoff in selecting the number of lags\
    \ and explores an alternative methodology to assess the robustness of their findings."
  23: The authors explore regional heterogeneity in the persistence of climate damages
    based on income levels, but find inconclusive evidence for applying heterogeneous
    persistence in their model.
  24: The table focuses on temperature variables that factor into estimates of damage
    persistence. The paper compares the lag-based approach to a low-pass filter approach
    for estimating persistence.
  27: The study explores the theoretical possibility that damage persistence decays
    exponentially over time.
  28: "The study uses longer records and a more rigorous treatment of uncertainties\
    \ during interpolation compared to some previous studies. Results for the period\
    \ 1986\u20132015 are used from Table C1. Medians of the ensemble are used in the\
    \ main model specification."
  29: Regions used in PAGE are chosen for economic coherence, rather than climatological
    distinctness, and this assumption is tested.

  2: PAGE-ICE model yields SCCO2 values about two times higher than PAGE09. Economy
    feedbacks demonstrate a manifold increase in the SCCO2.
  3: The paper extends previous findings that the effect of long-term economic persistence
    increases the SCCO2 outcome even more ($220-$417).
  4: "Uses 50,000 Monte Carlo draws (and 100,000 for PAGE09) to provide distributions\
    \ of results; relies on a 75 Gt pulse size in the first time period of PAGE-ICE\
    \ (mid-2017\u20132025), representing an annual pulse size of 10 GtCO2; Mean elasticity\
    \ of marginal utility of consumption of 1.17 (0.1\u20132.0); Pure time preference\
    \ rate of 1.03% (0.5%, 2.0%)."
  5: Models global and regional temperature variability using equations (1a) and (1b),
    with standard deviations derived from historical data.
  6: "The mean value of the SCCO2 in 2020 from PAGE09 is $158. Updating to IPCC AR5\
    \ increases the mean SCCO2 to $217. Applying a fat-tailed distribution to sea-level\
    \ rise increases mean SCCO2 to $228. The permafrost feedback increases it to $244.\
    \ Modeling non-linear transitions in the sea ice and land snow albedo feedback\
    \ slightly reduces the SCCO2 to $239. Reducing the size, threshold, and lag of\
    \ discontinuity impacts reduces the mean SCCO2 slightly to $213. A longer simulation\
    \ period (until 2300) further increases the mean SCCO2 to $239. Updating baseline\
    \ income levels increases mean SCCO2 to $245. Adjusting the vulnerability of regions\
    \ increases the mean SCCO2 to $281. Empirical estimates increase the final mean\
    \ SCCO2 for PAGE-ICE is calculated as $307 per tonne. The interquartile range\
    \ is $147\u2013$349, and a 5%\u201395% range of $82\u2013$831. 50.1% (34.5%\u2013\
    69.0%, interquartile range) of GDP damages persists as impacts on growth."
  7: Mean global GDP in 2100 is 30% lower than the SSP2-4.5 growth path without persistence.
    By 2200, the mean growth loss due to the persistence of climate impacts under
    SSP2-4.5 exceeds the GDP growth rate in the whole Global South, causing economic
    contraction. The share of runs of negative growth on a global scale as early as
    2100 exceeds 8%. The 'India+', 'Africa+' and 'Latin America' regions reach income
    levels associated with extreme poverty in 12%, 11% and 4% of Monte Carlo simulations,
    respectively. Mean economic output in the 'Russia+' region is 52% higher with
    persistence. A 10% persistence leads to a fifteenfold increase in the mean SCCO2.
  8: SCCO2 exceeding $500 if current persistence is 20% and decreases by 0.5% annually;
    a reduction of at least 3% per year in persistence needed for SCCO2 to be less
    than $600; mean increase of $21 (6.5%) in SCCO2 for SSP2-4.5 when accounting for
    temperature variability.
  9: The paper provides quantitative information on the social cost of carbon dioxide
    (SCCO2) distributions, the effect of variability on projected damages in 2100
    expressed as a percentage of GDP, and temperature distributions with and without
    variability effects. Figure 5c shows the effect of variability on projected damages
    in 2100 expressed as a percentage of GDP in that year.
