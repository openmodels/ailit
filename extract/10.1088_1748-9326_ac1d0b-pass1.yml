Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate feedbacks, economy feedbacks, and climate extremes, temperature variability.
  3: Temperature rises can inhibit GDP growth due to damaged capital stocks, lower
    savings, and inefficient factor reallocation.
  4: Climate-induced damages, including discontinuity risk, non-economic damages,
    economic damages, and sea-level rise damages.
  6: Climate change impacts, including sea level rise, permafrost thaw, changes in
    surface albedo, and regional temperature changes; Different modelling choices
  7: Climate change damages, specifically the persistence of those damages on growth.
  8: Temperature-induced economic damages and their persistence, adaptation rate,
    temperature variability
  9: Interannual temperature variability.
  10: Temperature anomalies (warm and cold years), climate change-induced damages,
    damage persistence, radiative forcing, emissions scenarios.
  11: The risk driver is additional CO2 emissions, specifically a pulse of CO2 in
    the model.
  13: Changes in model parameters (specifically, a one standard deviation increase
    or decrease in various parameters) within the PAGE-ICE model; Tolerable temperature
    before a discontinuity occurs.
  14: Parameter changes such as transient climate response, time preference, and warming
    half-life impact the social cost of carbon (SCCO2).
  15: The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) 1-5, representing different socio-economic
    development trajectories.
  16: "Persistence of damages could cause economic collapse of some regions and affects\
    \ growth; economic damages are represented by parameter \u03C1 affecting growth\
    \ rate."
  17: Temperature shocks, climate change related damages.
  18: Temperature shocks impacting economic growth.
  19: Temperature shocks are a driver of risk, specifically the effect of temperature
    lags on economic growth.
  20: Temperature and precipitation, with temperature measured in current and lagged
    values
  21: "Damage persistence parameter \u03C1"
  22: Temperature changes
  23: Temperature and temperature squared
  24: Temperature and precipitation, including lagged effects of both.
  25: Temperature is identified as a driver impacting GDP per capita growth, with
    persistence of effects in regions with lower GDP per capita.
  26: Temperature changes serve as a key driver of macroeconomic outcomes, specifically
    GDP per capita growth.
  28: Interannual temperature variability; Changes in temperature variability (increase
    in tropics, especially Amazonia)
  30: Annual temperature (GMST) is modeled using year, CO2 concentration, and a LOESS
    of observed GMST.

Highlights:
  2: Climate-economy feedbacks and climate extremes are essential for estimating the
    SCCO2 and its uncertainty. The large impacts of climate change if future adaptation
    does not exceed historical trends.
  3: The paper aims to quantify the effect on the SCCO2 of including long-term temperature
    growth feedback, temperature anomalies, and Arctic feedbacks.
  4: PAGE-ICE model includes updates to capture a more detailed representation of
    climate elements such as CO2 and CH4 sinks, permafrost feedback, and sea ice decline
    impacts, as well as persistent climate-induced damages affecting GDP pathways.
  6: The mean SCCO2 in PAGE-ICE is double the value for PAGE09; increased social costs
    are attributed almost entirely to the Global South; Empirical estimates of damage
    persistence has large effects.
  7: Persistence of climate damages leads to a considerable redistribution of income
    to the detriment of poorer regions; even a small amount of damage persistence
    (10%) significantly increases the SCCO2; high levels of damage persistence can
    lead to economic contraction in the Global South.
  8: "Adaptation is crucial to reducing the Social Cost of Carbon; high persistence\
    \ of damages combined with low or no adaptation leads to a substantial share of\
    \ Monte Carlo runs producing SCCO2 estimates of zero due to PAGE-ICE\u2019s damage\
    \ cap; temperature variability widens SCCO2 uncertainty ranges"
  9: Introduction of symmetric temperature variation widens tails at both ends of
    the SCCO2 distributions, with the possibility of SCCO2 values damages.
  10: Damage persistence is one of the most important factors in calculating the SCCO2;
    annual temperature anomalies lead to large increases in uncertainty about the
    risks of climate change; previous SCCO2 results may have underestimated damages,
    especially in the Global South; economic uncertainty is larger than climate science
    uncertainty in climate-economy system analysis.
  11: The paper discusses the importance of the pulse size in calculating the SCCO2,
    noting that smaller pulses are too variable and larger pulse sizes might not accurately
    capture marginal damages.
  13: Changes in specific parameters within the PAGE-ICE model can have significant
    impacts on the SCCO2; a decrease in tolerable temperature before discontinuity
    can lead to a substantial increase in SCCO2.
  14: The transient response parameter has a significant impact when increased, and
    the tolerability discontinuity has a large impact when decreased.
  15: The paper provides parameters for extending population and GDP per capita projections
    under different SSP scenarios. Figure A5 illustrates these extended projections
    for SSP2 and SSP5, including uncertainty ranges.
  16: High persistence of damages and their growth effects may lead to near economic
    collapse; constrained by subsistence bounds.
  17: Damage estimates are highly sensitive to the level of equity weighting. The
    model uses a consumption floor based on the World Bank's extreme poverty threshold.
  18: The introduction of a convergence system slightly decreases the social cost
    of carbon dioxide (SCCO2), although the effect is modest compared to other model
    parameter settings.
  19: Damage persistence estimates vary significantly depending on the number of temperature
    lags included in the regression model. The estimated persistence with one lag
    is 52.8%, but it drops to 27.8% with two lags and 10.3% with four lags.
  20: "Current temperature has a statistically significant positive effect on GDP\
    \ per capita growth, while current temperature squared has a statistically significant\
    \ negative effect. Lagged temperature and squared temperature terms have mixed\
    \ effects, some significant and some not. The 'Resulting \u03C1' row shows the\
    \ implied persistence of the temperature effect on GDP growth based on the estimated\
    \ coefficients."
  21: "The paper explores the effect of the damage persistence parameter \u03C1 on\
    \ regional GDP levels"
  22: Low-pass filtering yields higher persistence levels but a lower Monte Carlo
    mean SCCO2 due to more Monte Carlo runs reaching the maximum damage level; Implementing
    persistence as a global parameter is a strong assumption that does not represent
    heterogeneity across climate zones or income levels
  23: "The analysis finds statistically significant relationships between temperature\
    \ and temperature squared and GDP per capita growth. The persistence of the effect,\
    \ represented by \u03C1, decreases as the temperature data is filtered more. The\
    \ authors find inconclusive evidence for spatially heterogeneous persistence."
  24: "The persistence of temperature's impact on GDP per capita growth is estimated,\
    \ with values of \u03C1 ranging from 100.00% to -94.29% depending on the number\
    \ of lags included in the model."
  25: Lower GDP per capita regions experience persistence in damages from temperature
    changes, while richer regions may experience opposing effects.
  26: Temperature has varying impacts on GDP per capita growth depending on income
    levels (below or above GDPpc median) and different temporal filters.
  28: Finds strongly positive changes in interannual temperature variability over
    the tropics, especially over Amazonia, whilst seeing little increases in variability
    over Europe; Does not find global or PAGE-ICE region-specific evidence that justifies
    increasing or decreasing temperature variability with rising global temperatures
    in simulations
  30: GMST can be modeled using combinations of year, CO2 concentration, LOESS smoothed
    GMST, and lagged GMST, with R-squared values up to 0.862.
  31: The table provides insights into the regional temperature impacts on different
    unspecified outcomes, with coefficient values indicating varied sensitivity by
    region.
  32: The figure shows the correlation in model errors across regions for different
    models, allowing comparison of how different modeling approaches affect the spatial
    correlation of errors.
Methodology:
  2: Compares the PAGE-ICE model with the older PAGE09 model. Extends PAGE-ICE with
    economy feedbacks based on an empirically derived estimate of partially persistent
    economic damages. Includes an estimate of interannual temperature variability.
  3: The paper extends the PAGE-ICE CB-IAM to quantify the effect on the SCCO2 of
    including possible long-term temperature growth feedback on economic trajectories,
    mean annual temperature anomalies, and the already modeled permafrost carbon and
    surface albedo feedbacks.
  4: Monte Carlo sampling of over 150 parameter distributions using the PAGE-ICE model,
    translated into the Mimi modeling framework, to assess climate and damage modules,
    with scenarios based on the Tier 1 scenarios of ScenarioMIP.
  6: Monte Carlo simulations (50000 runs); Panel regression analysis using historical
    temperature and GDP data (Burke et al 2015); Integrated Assessment Model (PAGE-ICE);
    SSP2-4.5 scenario for projections.
  7: Integrated Assessment Model (PAGE-ICE) with incorporated growth effects and Monte
    Carlo simulations, using SSP2-RCP4.5 scenario.
  8: The study uses the PAGE-ICE model and Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the
    Social Cost of Carbon, considering the persistence of economic damages, adaptation
    reducing damage persistence, and annual temperature variability; the model is
    run for 10% and 0.5% steps in persistence and adaptation rate respectively, and
    then interpolated for plotting purposes
  9: PAGE model, Monte Carlo runs
  10: Uses the PAGE (Policy Analysis of the Greenhouse Effect) model and its integrated
    assessment model variant PAGE-ICE, with modifications to include annual temperature
    variability, permafrost thawing, surface albedo feedbacks, and empirical estimates
    of damage persistence.
  11: The paper uses the PAGE model to run simulations with and without a CO2 pulse.
    It also uses a two-step Bayesian approach with the Stan computational system to
    extrapolate population and income levels past 2100 using SSP data.
  13: Deterministic run of the PAGE-ICE model for SSP2-4.5; SCCO2 impact calculated
    as the difference between the SCCO2 for the mean of the respective parameter's
    Monte Carlo distribution and the SCCO2 for a parameter value equal to the mean
    value increased/decreased by one standard deviation; all other parameters remain
    at their default value; the model reports annual SCCO2 distributions.
  14: The analysis is performed using a deterministic run of the PAGE-ICE model for
    SSP2-4.5, comparing mean parameter values with adjusted values by one standard
    deviation.
  15: "The paper uses a population and income extension model, parameterized with\
    \ \u03B4 and \u03B2 values shown in Table A3. Figure A5 displays model outputs\
    \ for SSP2 and SSP5."
  16: The analysis uses Monte Carlo simulations with 50,000 runs to estimate SCCO2
    values under different scenarios; different persistence assumptions in economic
    model affect growth outcomes; a convergence system avoids discontinuities in the
    results.
  17: Uses the PAGE-ICE model. Introduces boundaries for economic collapse and equity
    weighting using logistic paths to smooth out discontinuities. Monte Carlo simulations
    are performed.
  18: Fixed effects regressions of economic growth on temperature and other variables,
    including lags to assess long-term impacts.
  19: The study uses a regression model based on Burke et al (2015) with temperature
    lags to estimate damage persistence. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to
    derive a parameter distribution. They also apply a Butterworth low-pass filter
    to climate variables in a separate approach, similar to Bastien-Olvera and Moore
    (2021).
  20: Regression analysis with country and year fixed effects, and country-specific
    time trends. Models use varying numbers of temperature and precipitation lags
    (up to 5). A low-pass filter is applied to temperature and precipitation data
    to analyze persistence.
  21: Monte Carlo simulation with 5000 bootstrap samples drawing with replacement
    from country clusters
  22: The persistence of temperature impacts is estimated using a low-pass Butterworth
    filter on temperature data; Bootstrap samples are used to estimate the implied
    persistence; Regression models are used with different filter settings; The persistence
    parameter is estimated for two groups of countries, rich and poor, based on 1980
    GDP per capita
  23: The analysis uses regressions to model the relationship between GDP per capita
    growth and low-pass filtered climate variables (temperature and temperature squared).
    Different filters (3-year, 5-year, 10-year) are applied to the temperature data.
    The models are estimated using data from Burke et al. (2015), and standard errors
    are clustered at the country level. Bootstrap sampling is used to estimate percentiles.
    The authors also explore regional heterogeneity by splitting the sample into poorer
    and richer countries based on PPP.
  24: Baseline regression model based on Burke et al. (2015) for countries with GDP
    per capita below the median. The regression model includes temperature, precipitation,
    country and year fixed effects, and country-specific time trends. The model is
    run with varying numbers of temperature lags (up to five), and corresponding precipitation
    lags are included as well.
  25: The analysis is performed using a baseline regression model with country and
    year fixed effects and country-specific time trends. The model considers temperature
    as a variable with various lags.
  26: 'Analysis involves regression of GDP per capita growth on low-pass filtered
    climate variables, using data from Burke et al. (2015) with country-level clustered
    standard errors. Different temporal filters applied: unfiltered, 3-year, 5-year,
    and 10-year. Results include bootstrapped confidence intervals.'
  30: The analysis uses Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to model annual global
    mean surface temperature (GMST) with different combinations of trend, CO2 concentration,
    and LOESS smoothed GMST, accounting for autocorrelation using lagged GMST. An
    alternative temperature variability model without auto-regression is also explored
    (equation C1a and C1b).
  31: An autoregressive model is used by region to analyze temperature effects with
    dependent variable results shown, including adjustments for lag variables.
  32: "Compares model errors across regions using Pearson correlation. Models include\
    \ 'Raw Temperatures', 'LOESS-only Model', 'AR-only Model', and 'Full AR Model'.\

More Notes:
  2: Higher damages in the Global South are primarily responsible for the manifold
    increase in SCCO2 stemming from economy feedbacks and other increases since PAGE09.
  3: The study compares the PAGE-ICE CB-IAM with PAGE09 and attributes changes in
    the SCCO2 to specific model changes.
  6: Updating climate sensitivity and other climate parameters to conform to IPCC
    AR5 increases the mean SCCO2 to $217; The size, threshold, and lag of discontinuity
    impacts are reduced, since Arctic feedbacks and catastrophic sea level rise are
    now explicitly modeled, reducing the mean SCCO2 slightly to $213.
  7: Total climate damages in PAGE are capped to an exogenous statistical value of
    society, which can cause SCCO2 estimates to decrease at high persistence levels;
    the mean SCCO2 estimate is sensitive to equity weighting parameters and varies
    across methodologies.
  9: The interaction of temperature variability with the convex empirical temperature-damage
    function used for market damages explains distributions of SCCO2.
  10: The study used a global model of damage persistence without regional disaggregation,
    which risks omitting inequalities caused by altered long-run growth pathways.
    The study emphasizes the need for future research focusing on growth effects in
    the Global South.
  11: The authors acknowledge support from various organizations and declare a conflict
    of interest for one author due to advising companies in the energy sector.
  13: The annual model reports SCCO2 distributions that differ from the original model
    due to changes in the discontinuity sector and the model design of PAGE09 where
    each timestep year covers half of the time to the next analysis year.
  15: The paper focuses on extending socio-economic scenarios, rather than directly
    modeling climate change impacts or adaptation measures.
  16: To prevent infinite utility-weighted damages from regions with potential economic
    collapse, a subsistence level bound is set based on per capita consumption at
    the World Bank extreme poverty threshold.
  17: The damage function in Burke et al (2015) is expressed in % of GDP per capita,
    not % of GDP. The model assumes that temperature shocks result in a minor decrease
    in population.
  18: No relevant information.
  19: The paper explores the robustness of persistence estimates using different methodologies,
    acknowledging the uncertainty in determining the appropriate number of temperature
    lags.
  20: "The table explores the impact of temperature lags on the relationship between\
    \ temperature and GDP per capita growth. The 'Resulting \u03C1' row attempts to\
    \ quantify the persistence of these temperature impacts."
  22: The newly proposed method (considering longer time horizons for persistence
    via low-pass filtering climate variables) does not produce results that show substantially
    different damage persistence behaviour from the insights in their main approach
    (assessing persistence via lag coefficients)
  23: "The authors mention that estimates for \u03C1 vary considerably, even when\
    \ using one lag. Subsampling reduces statistical power. The analysis is based\
    \ on data provided by Burke et al. (2015). The study uses both lag-based and low-pass\
    \ filtering approaches to estimate persistence. The analysis explores the possibilities\
    \ of regional heterogeneity in persistence, but finds no clear evidence."
  24: The authors use temperature lag coefficients to derive a persistence distribution,
    finding some evidence that poorer regions might be more vulnerable to persistent
    growth impacts of temperature shocks. This is contrasted with results for higher-income
    countries.
  28: Focuses on changes in temperature variability, not directly on macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes; The Ilyas et al (2017) dataset is used.
  30: The page also describes an alternative temperature model with independent temperature
    variability, and mentions impact of the alternative model on the SCCO2 (Social
    Cost of Carbon Dioxide) (table A4).
  32: The paper focuses on modeling temperature data and analyzing model errors, and
    doesn't directly address macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes of climate change or
    adaptation costs/benefits. The figure legend refers to temperature residuals and
    model comparisons, not economic data.

Quantitative material:
  2: PAGE-ICE yields SCCO2 values about two times higher than PAGE09 due to climate
    and economic updates. Economy feedbacks demonstrate a manifold increase in the
    SCCO2 resulting from partially persistent economic damages. Including an estimate
    of interannual temperature variability increases the width of the SCCO2 distribution
    and a slight increase in the mean SCCO2.
  3: "The effect of long-term persistence (of climate impacts) is shown to increase\
    \ the outcome even more ($220\u2013$417) (compared to Kalkuhl and Wenz (2020)\
    \ result of $37\u2013$132)."

    growth
  7: Mean global GDP in 2100 is 30% lower than the SSP2-4.5 growth path without persistence;

    Africa+, and Latin America reach income levels associated with extreme poverty
    in 12%, 11%, and 4% of Monte Carlo simulations; Russia+ mean economic output is
    52% higher with persistence; fifteenfold increase in the mean SCCO2 with 10% damage
    persistence.
  8: "If current persistence of damages is around 50%, a decrease of more than 2%\
    \ per year via adaptation is needed to reduce the model\u2019s SCCO2 to below\
    \ $2500; a reduction of at least 3% per year would be needed to see a SCCO2 of\
    \ less than $600; with current persistence at 20% and decreasing by 0.5% annually,\
    \ more than 5% of Monte Carlo runs reach PAGE-ICE's damage cap and the SCCO2 exceeds\
