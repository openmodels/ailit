Drivers of Risk:
  1: Higher summer temperatures negatively impact Agriculture-Silviculture and Fishing
    industries.
  2: Temperature and rain precipitation fluctuations impacting economic activity,
    with notable effects on Agriculture-Silviculture and Fishing sectors.
  4: Not explicitly stated on this page, but the overall paper investigates the impact
    of climate change.
  5: Changes in temperature and precipitation.
  8: The page discusses changes in precipitation and temperature as potential drivers
    impacting economic outcomes, with specific reference to temporal changes from
    1950-2017.
  9: Seasonal temperatures and precipitation.
  10: Higher summer temperatures over the last 35 years directly negatively impacted
    Agriculture-Silviculture and Fishing sectors in Chile.
  11: Changes in temperature (monthly averages) and their impact across industries.
  12: Global temperature rise under RCP scenarios, particularly RCP 4.5 and 8.5.
  13: Global temperature increase is the main driver of risk affecting industries
    and overall GDP.
  16: Climate change-induced temperature increases are the primary drivers impacting
    GDP and industry output.
  17: Changes in temperature (higher temperatures in summer, specifically January)
    and, to a lesser extent, fluctuations in precipitation.
  18: Impact of climate change on GDP varies depending on whether positive effects
    are considered.
Highlights:
  1: Higher temperatures have a negative effect on agriculture, fishing, construction,
    and utilities in Chile. However, climate change did not have a big impact on the
    Chilean economy during the study period.
  2: Climate change had a low overall impact on Chile's GDP over the past 35 years,
    with only Agriculture and Fishing significantly affected during the summer.
  4: Mining, financial services, manufacturing, personal services, and commerce are
    the largest economic sectors in Chile. Mining is the largest sector in regions
    II and III, while the Capital Region (XIII) represents more than 40% of the national
    GDP and population.
  5: Financial Services and Commerce are more prevalent in the capital region. Mining
    has almost no value for the capital, even if it represents the largest economic
    sector in the nation; Mean precipitation has been falling in Chile over time,
    while mean temperatures have increased substantially.
  8: The analysis shows a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature
    for Chile and all its macrozones (except the North) between 1980-1989 and 2010-2017.
  10: Statistically significant negative impacts of temperature on the Agriculture-Silviculture
    and Fishing sectors, with results robust for both monthly and quarterly models.
  11: Shows varied temperature impacts on industries like agriculture, fishing, and
    mining with noted statistical significance.
  12: Statistically significant negative impacts on GDP growth rate in multiple industries
    including Agriculture, Fishing, and Manufacturing.
  13: "Fishing industry is severely impacted, potentially disappearing by 2100 at\
    \ a 1.0\xB0C increase; Mining and Home property also face declines. Despite these,\
    \ total GDP for Chile increases across scenarios in 2050 and 2100."
  16: Climate change could lead to deterioration of Chile's GDP by 6.8% to 12.9% by
    2050, and 15.5% to 42.3% by 2100, with significant impacts on agriculture, fishing,
    construction, and financial services.
  17: Climate change had a statistically significant negative effect on economic activity
    in Chile, mainly driven by higher temperatures. The strongest negative impact
    is from high temperatures in January on the Agriculture-Silviculture and Fishing
    sectors. The overall impact on GDP is limited because the most affected sectors
    represent a small fraction of the economy.
  18: "Negative impact on Chile\u2019s GDP if ignoring positive coefficients; small\
    \ positive growth impact in 1985\u20132017; importance of understanding long-term\
    \ versus seasonal impacts."
Methodology:
  1: Region-industry panel data analysis for Chile over the period 1985 to 2017.
  2: Econometric analysis using annual GDP data for 12 economic sectors across 15
    Chilean regions over the period 1985 to 2017, using temperature and precipitation
    as control variables with region-specific fixed effects.
  4: Adjusted GDP series from 1985-2017 by linking earlier datasets using an adjustment
    factor, indexed to the CPI (UF, Unidad de Fomento); Weighted regressions are used
    to address industry GDP is negative for specific regions when there are few firms
    operating and one has costs exceeding revenue.
  5: The paper uses weather data from the University of Delaware Air Temperature and
    Precipitation dataset (1900-2017). Geospatial software (QGIS) is used to aggregate
    weather data to the regional level, weighting each grid cell by the fraction falling
    within each region. Weather variables and GDP are combined into a panel dataset.
  9: Panel data structure with fixed effects (time-industry and region-industry) and
    heterogeneous coefficients for weather variables. Models estimated by OLS with
    robust standard-errors clustered by region and year.
  10: The analysis uses OLS with fixed effects by time and region, performing separate
    regressions by industry and analyzing quarterly data.
  11: OLS regressions with fixed effects by time and region are used, including lagged
    industry growth and monthly precipitation in the regression.
  12: Analysis uses regression models to estimate the impact of temperature changes
    on industrial GDP, considering different RCP scenarios.
  13: Impact simulated using model coefficients applied under different climate emission
    paths, examining effects over time with a focus on fixed vs. statistically significant
    coefficients.
  16: The analysis uses simulated impact scenarios based on estimated climate change
    temperature coefficients derived from industry data (post-1997) for the USA, and
    applies them to the Chilean context.
  17: Annual region-industry panel data analysis for Chile from 1985 to 2017. Stress
    tests using global climate paths published by the United Nations, and IPCC scenarios.
  18: Analysis performed using industry coefficients with scenarios applying only
    statistically significant coefficients.
More Notes:
  2: Some industries may benefit positively from temperature increases outside of
    summer, and climate change impacts were found to vary differently for the southern
    hemisphere.
  4: Financial services costs are not disaggregated to the industry level before 2008,
    potentially over-estimating industry output.
  5: The paper uses both surface area and GDP to weight regional averages of precipitation
    and temperature when calculating national-level values. GDP-weighted measures
    are considered potentially more accurate for economic activities, while surface-weighted
    measures are considered a better proxy for the impact on natural habitats and
    biodiversity.
  10: Robustness checks included unweighted regressions and different clustering options,
    yielding similar qualitative results.
  12: Estimates focus on impacts relative to a no-climate-change scenario, not to
    historical data.
  17: The study acknowledges the limitations of using monthly data due to the unavailability
    of regional-industry GDP data at a quarterly or monthly frequency.
  18: The model uses fixed coefficients and annual frequency data, leading to challenges
    in estimating the impacts of climate change.
  21: This page is primarily a list of references. The title mentions the impact of
    climate change on economic output across industries in Chile, but the page itself
    does not contain any analysis or results related to this topic. The page only
    contains reference information. Albagli (2021) may contain relevant information
    about limites planetarios y capital natural from the Central Bank of Chile.
