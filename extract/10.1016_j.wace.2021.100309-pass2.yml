Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on tropical cyclones, Baiu, precipitation, and seasonal
    storms, especially TC (typhoon) activity; heavy precipitation events; river flooding;
    storm surge.
  4: Tropical cyclones (typhoons) becoming more destructive in a future warmer climate,
    leading to increased heavy rainfalls and strong winds at local scales.
  9: Increase in frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events (Baiu and Guerrilla-heavy
    rainfall) due to climate change.
  11: Extreme rainfall events and their resulting discharges are identified as drivers
    of risk impacting flood defenses in highly urbanized river basins.
  12: Increased rainfall and river discharge due to climate change (4-degree temperature
    rise scenario).
  16: Climate change-induced storm surge risk, including the ambiguity caused by insufficient
    knowledge of TC systems.
Highlights:
  1: The paper reviews climate change impact assessments and summarizes projected
    future changes in precipitation, river flooding, and coastal hazards, and their
    associated economic impacts, focusing on Japan and East Asia.
  9: The occurrence frequency of extreme rainfall will increase in all future ensemble
    members. Future changes of Guerrilla-heavy rainfall could be generated by analyzing
    multi-polarimetric weather radar and NHRCM05 data together. There is a non-linear
    dynamical effect that strengthens the formation process that organizes and maintains
    the rain-band system.
  11: Future changes in extreme rainfall and the resulting river discharges were analyzed,
    with findings showing increased rainfall and discharge in future scenarios for
    urbanized river basins in Japan.
  12: Flood damages vary more largely with larger return periods; Exceedance probability
    of annual flood damage of 800 billion Japanese Yen can be as high as 0.01.
  16: Risk and uncertainty premiums are not negligible in size and occur unevenly
    among areas where there is risk of flood damage. Risk and uncertainty premiums
    cannot be ignored when evaluating the economic value of a policy that mitigates
    storm surge flood risk under ambiguity.
Methodology:
  1: A collaborative research program in Japan projects long-term changes in natural
    hazards in Japan and East Asia based on local-scale and large-ensemble numerical
    experiments; the paper reviews recent climate change impact assessments from the
    program.
  4: Dynamical approach is used for TC hazard projection and impact assessment, considering
    meteorological settings of historical TCs. This involves downscaling TC hazards
    to local scales using dynamical methods. River hazards, Coastal hazards, Winds,
    and Water Resources are considered.
  9: Uses a 5-km-mesh NHRCM (NHRCM05) forced with an AGCM under SRES A1B, analyzed
    four ensemble members of NHRCM05 under the newer RCP8.5 scenario, and a cloud
    resolving numerical model with a horizontal 500 m resolution under the RCP8.5
    scenario.
  11: The analysis involved comparing probability distributions of extreme rainfall
    events using datasets like d4PDF and observational datasets, along with hydrological
    modeling for future flood risk assessment.
  12: Uses d4PDF historical and future climate experiments to derive flood risk curves
    and analyze exceedance probabilities of flood damage in the Yodo River basin in
    Japan.
  16: A web-based survey using choice experiments to assess willingness to pay for
    eliminating storm surge risk and ambiguity. A Limited Degree of Confidence (LDC)
    model is used to estimate preferences on risk and ambiguity. 25 PDFs of storm
    surge flood risk are generated, with individuals focusing on the average and worst-case
    PDFs.
More Notes:
  1: The paper acknowledges the challenges in projecting future changes and their
    economic impacts due to the low occurrence frequencies of TC-related hazards in
    any one particular area.
  9: The study focuses on projecting future changes in extreme rainfall events in
    Japan, specifically Baiu and Guerrilla-heavy rainfall, under different climate
    change scenarios.  The analysis involves a combination of numerical modeling,
    radar data analysis, and identification of atmospheric patterns. It appears the
    work by Nakakita et al. (2016) was the first to connect extreme rainfall events
    identified directly from an NHRCM05 with atmospheric circulation patterns.
  12: Analysis focuses on the Yodo River basin in Japan as a case study.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic loss associated with precipitation, river flooding, and coastal hazards.
  4: Social damage (life and asset loss) and economic damage are assessed as impacts
    of projected hazards.

  12: Flood damage measured in Japanese Yen.
  16: Economic value of storm surge risk mitigation policies (e.g., raising a dike),
    decomposed into expected loss reduction, risk premium, and ambiguity premium.
Quantitative material:
  1: No specific quantitative results mentioned on this page, but the paper summarizes
    projected future changes in precipitation, river flooding, and coastal hazards,
    and their associated economic impacts.
  9: Presents a figure (Fig. 5) showing future changes of Baiu extreme rainfall (over
    50 mm/h) in terms of duration and accumulated amount. Also finds an increasing
    trend in the occurrence frequency of Guerrilla-heavy rainfall around the Kansai
    region of Japan (Fig. 6, not on this page).
  12: "200-year annual maximum 24-h rainfall for the d4PDF future experiment is 1.3\u2013\
    1.4 times larger than the historical experiment; 200-year annual maximum river\
    \ discharge for the d4PDF future experiment is 1.5\u20131.7 times larger than\
    \ the historic experiment; Flood damage can exceed 800 billion Japanese Yen."
  16: The sample average of the ambiguity attitude parameter was around 0.1, indicating
    that the worst PDF was overemphasized.
