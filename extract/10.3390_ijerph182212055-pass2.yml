Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme climate shocks, specifically the 2008 snow disaster in China, impact
    agricultural green development.
  2: Extreme climate shocks (snowstorm).
  3: Extreme climate shocks cause a decrease in agricultural income, reduce farming
    willingness, increase long-term risks, and lead to higher energy consumption and
    increased use of fertilizers and pesticides.
  6: Snow disaster (January 2008) in China, linked to rainfall fluctuations.
  7: Rainfall fluctuations (total and during rainy season), specifically focusing
    on the impact of a snow disaster (January 2008)
  8: January 2008 rainfall fluctuations (snow disaster)
  9: Snow disaster
  10: Snow disaster (Rainsi x Postt).

  17: Snow disasters (extreme climate shocks) are the primary driver of risk.
  18: Extreme climate shocks, specifically the 2008 snow disaster in China
  19: Snow disasters and effective irrigation rates are identified as factors impacting
    GAD.
  20: "Rainfall shocks (measured as Rainsi\xD7 Postt, where 'Rain' represents rainfall\
    \ and 'Post' likely represents a time period after a specific event or policy\
    \ change)"
  21: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: Extreme climate shocks are found detrimental to green agricultural development,
    with greater impact in humid and developed regions.
  2: Extreme climate shocks impede Green Agricultural Development (GAD) in the long
    term.
  3: Extreme climate shocks significantly affect agricultural production, leading
    to long-term climate risks and changes in farmers' production decisions that reduce
    green agricultural development.
  6: "The core independent variable, Rainsi \xD7 Postt, aims to capture the effect\
    \ of the snow disaster on Green Agricultural Development (GAD)."
  7: The economic characteristics of counties appear to be unrelated to whether they
    were affected by the snow disaster. The control and treatment groups show good
    stability, supporting the validity of the empirical results.
  8: The snow disaster reduced the level of GAD.
  9: The snow disaster significantly reduced the level of GAD. The impact is estimated
    to be a 3.07% decrease in the GAD index.
  10: Snow disaster has a statistically significant and negative impact on the GAD
    index.
  11: The 2008 snow disaster in China had a significant negative impact on green agricultural
    development (GAD), even after controlling for land transfer policies, rainfall
    fluctuations, effective irrigation rate, education, and sample self-selection
    bias using PSM.
  12: The snow disaster had a statistically significant negative impact on the level
    of GAD, even after robustness checks, alternative identification methods, instrumental
    variable estimation, and alternative GAD index construction.
  13: The negative impact of the snow disaster on GAD is not due to omitted random
    variables.
  14: The impact of snow disasters on GAD has significant heterogeneity in different
    climate regions. The inhibitory effect of snow disasters on GAD mainly occurs
    in areas with abundant rainfall.
  15: Extreme climate shocks (snow disaster) negatively affect the Green Agricultural
    Development (GAD) index, with heterogeneous impacts depending on the region's
    economic development level. The impacts of extreme climate shocks on GAD does
    not have significant heterogeneity in agricultural and non-agricultural counties.
  16: Snow disasters significantly reduce farmland utilization and increase agricultural
    production energy consumption.
  17: Extreme weather events (snow disasters) can lead to an increase in the quantity
    of agricultural products but a decrease in the quality and overall value of agricultural
    output, as measured by primary industry value-added.
  18: Extreme climate shocks hinder Green Agricultural Development (GAD).
  19: Snow disaster hinders GAD, and effective irrigation has a significant positive
    effect on GAD.
  20: "The paper finds that rainfall shocks (Rain\u2217Post) have a statistically\
    \ significant negative impact on green agricultural development. Education and\
    \ effective irrigation rate have positive impacts on GAD. The inclusion of education\
    \ and effective irrigation rate does not bias the baseline results related to\
    \ rainfall shocks."

Methodology:
  1: The analysis is conducted using the entropy weighting method to calculate the
    green agricultural development index and the difference-in-difference method to
    study the impact of the climate shock.
  2: Empirical analysis using a difference-in-difference (DID) method based on the
    degree of damage to each county during the 2008 snow disaster.
  3: Analysis uses a constructed GAD index through the entropy weight method and applies
    a difference-in-difference (DID) approach to address endogeneity and determine
    the causal effect of extreme climate shocks on green agricultural development
    (GAD).
  6: Difference-in-differences (DID) model using rainfall fluctuations (Rainsi) as
    a continuous variable to measure the degree of snow disaster impact on a Green
    Agricultural Development (GAD) index. Uses county-level fixed effects and time
    fixed effects. The GAD index is constructed using the entropy weighting method
    (EWM) based on variables in Table 1 (not shown).
  7: The study calculates annual rainfall fluctuations for each county using z-scores
    based on rainfall data from 2000-2018. Counties are divided into a treatment group
    (rainfall fluctuations above the median of 0.3 during the snow disaster) and a
    control group.
  8: Difference-in-differences (DID) estimation, comparing counties affected by rainfall
    fluctuations in January 2008 to non-affected counties after the event (Postt variable).
  9: Difference-in-differences (DID) method is used to estimate the impact of the
    snow disaster on the GAD index, controlling for various factors including population
    (POP), machinery, time fixed effects, and county fixed effects. Robustness checks
    include parallel trend tests and adding time trends.
  10: Panel data analysis with individual (county) and time fixed effects, regressions
    including control variables (time trend, municipalities, land transfer, rainfall),
    parallel trend test of GAD index. The analysis is based on data from 2000-2018.
  11: Difference-in-differences (DID), Propensity Score Matching with DID (PSM-DID),
    Two-stage least squares (2SLS). Models are run on county-level data from 2000
    to 2018 in China.
  12: Difference-in-differences (DID) identification method, two-stage least squares
    method (2SLS) with instrumental variables (IVs). The analysis focuses on the impact
    of the 2008 snow disaster in China on the level of GAD.
  13: Difference-in-differences (DID) variable is constructed and tested via placebo
    tests involving random assignment of provinces to treatment and control groups.
    This process is repeated 500 and 800 times. The study uses data from 2086 counties
    from 31 provinces in China, focusing on the 2008 snow disaster. Results are applicable
    to the context of snow disasters in China's agricultural sector.
  14: Regression analysis using climate zone (humid, semi-humid, semi-arid) and poverty
    status (poor/non-poor counties) as heterogeneity factors, controlling for individual
    and time fixed effects.
  15: Regression analysis with individual and time fixed effects. Heterogeneity analysis
    based on industrial structure (agricultural vs. non-agricultural counties) and
    economic development level (East, Middle, West regions).

    using regression with interaction term (Rainsi x Postt). Significance level of
    1%.

More Notes:
  2: "The study finds heterogeneity in climate extremes\u2019 impact on GAD due to\
    \ climate and economic development differences, with a greater impact in humid\
    \ zones and economically developed areas."
  6: The paper focuses on the impact of a specific snow disaster event in China on
    Green Agricultural Development (GAD), and uses a continuous variable representing
    rainfall fluctuations to better identify the disaster's impact on each region.
  7: The study uses the FLDAS Noah Land Surface Model L4 Global Monthly data for rainfall
    data. The focus is on the impact of rainfall fluctuations during a specific snow
    disaster in January 2008, rather than long-term climate change impacts.
  8: The impact of total population (POP), secondary industry value-added (Second),
    and total social investment (Invest) are not significant.
  9: The paper finds that other control variables (besides agriculture-related ones)
    have little effect on the level of green agriculture, suggesting that the GAD
    does not completely depend on the overall economic level and government intervention
    is relatively independent.
  10: The impact of snow disaster on GAD index is not due to sample differences between
    municipalities and rural areas or the implementation of the land transfer policy.
  11: The study uses the promulgation of the Law on Land Contract as a cutoff point
    to control for the confounding effect of land transfer policies.
  12: The paper uses rainfall fluctuations and geographical location (latitude and
    longitude) as instrumental variables to address potential endogeneity issues.
  14: The study divides China into climate zones based on annual precipitation and
    uses the Chinese government's list of poor counties.  The effect of snow disasters
    on GAD is found to be relatively moderate in poor counties.
  15: The paper uses 'Rainsi x Postt' as a proxy for the snow disaster impact.
  16: The analysis focuses on the impact of snow disasters on agricultural production
    and related environmental factors. The paper uses the utilization rate of cultivated
    land and agricultural production energy consumption as mechanisms through which
    snow disasters affect the gap between agricultural and non-agricultural income.
    The paper suggests that farmers pursue short-term gains by increasing production
    input after extreme climate shocks, which can have negative environmental consequences.
  17: The study suggests that farmers respond to climate risks by increasing fertilizer
    and pesticide use to ensure short-term harvests, leading to long-term environmental
    degradation and a decline in the quality of agricultural products.
  18: "The study focuses on the agricultural sector in China and the impact of climate\
    \ shocks on farmers' production decisions. The paper suggests that government\
    \ subsidies and agricultural insurance can mitigate the negative impacts of extreme\
    \ climate shocks on GAD. The study identifies that extreme climate shocks change\
    \ farmers\u2019 income and expectations, and reduce the quality of agricultural\
    \ products in the long term."
  20: The study appears to be focused on agricultural green total factor productivity
    (potentially related to GDP through agriculture). The table includes regression
    coefficients, which indicate the direction and magnitude of the impact of rainfall,
    education, and irrigation on GAD. The authors assess robustness by including other
    factors, which suggests an attempt to isolate causal effects.
