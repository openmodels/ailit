Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, uncertainty about climate change, government subsidies, policy
    change risk/uncertainty
  2: Climate change and policy uncertainty (payment rates)
  4: Climate change and shifts in agricultural policies (specifically subsidies).
  5: Changes in exogenous variables like world market prices, technological progress,
    population growth, agricultural or trade policies, input or output prices or technologies,
    and climatic conditions impact agricultural sector outcomes.
  7: Climate change and related uncertainty, and policy related uncertainty.
  8: Sub-optimal temperatures, water deficit, and nitrogen deficit (for CERES-wheat
    only) impact crop yields. Agronomic practices like feed requirements, crop rotations
    and fertilizer needs are also relevant. The response of cereal and grass yields
    to nitrogen fertilizer inputs are modeled as non-linear with diminishing returns.
  10: "Climate (weather variable \u03B8) and policy (policy variable \u03D1) uncertainty,\
    \ specifically regarding yields and subsidy rates."
  11: Climate and policy uncertainty. Specific variables affected by uncertainty are
    crop yields.
  12: Climate uncertainty (affecting crop yields) and policy uncertainty (affecting
    payment rates).
  14: Changes in weather patterns (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, evapotranspiration)
    simulated by four GCMs and carbon dioxide levels.
  16: Climate change impacts on crop yields (timothy grass, wheat, rye, barley, and
    oat); Uncertainty in government budget support for agriculture
  17: Projected climate conditions (based on GCMs GISS-AOM and HADCM3), changes in
    nitrogen levels, technical progress (reduction in input costs)
  20: Climate uncertainty (yield changes), policy uncertainty (payment rates)
  21: Climate uncertainty and policy uncertainty.
  22: Climate uncertainty and policy uncertainty.
  23: Climate change, policy uncertainty, climate uncertainty, greenhouse gas emission
    scenario uncertainty, yield uncertainty, payment rate uncertainty
  25: Greenhouse gas emission scenarios, choice of crops and cultivars, crop management
    practices, climate change (temperature), policy uncertainty, international market
    food shortage.
  26: Climate and policy uncertainty.
  36: Climate projections for 2046-65 (BCM2.0, CSIRO-M.k3.0, GISS-AOM, HadCM3) impacting
    timothy yield. Baseline 1961-1990 climate conditions.
  41: Climate uncertainty (C) and Policy uncertainty (P), and a combination of both
    (C&P) are the drivers of risk.
Highlights:
  1: The study aims to determine the effects of a combination of policy and climate
    uncertainty on agricultural production, land use, and social welfare in Norway.
  2: Climate change can lead to lower cereal production, unchanged grass production,
    and more volatile crop yields, but also to higher farm incomes on average.
  4: The Norwegian farming sector is heavily dependent on governmental subsidies,
    making it vulnerable to policy shifts. A study of combined climate change and
    policy uncertainty could inform adjustments to agricultural policies and develop
    new strategies to handle associated uncertainty.
  7: The study aims to evaluate the combined effect of climate change and policy related
    uncertainty on key characteristics of the agricultural sector in Norway until
    2050.
  16: Climate change is projected to increase mean cereal yields by 11% in 2050. Uncertainty
    in budget support for agriculture is incorporated into the model.
  17: Projected climate conditions (2046-2065) generally lead to significantly higher
    yields of timothy grass and spring wheat compared to baseline conditions (1961-1990).
    The GCM HADCM3 projects higher spring wheat yields than other GCMs.
  20: Red meat production is negatively affected by climate and policy uncertainty.
    White meat production expands under these uncertainties due to lower feeding costs
    (climate) and payment rates (policy). Climate and policy uncertainty reinforce
    each other.
  21: Agricultural area is not significantly increased even under favorable conditions,
    and falls significantly under unfavorable conditions. Combining climate and policy
    uncertainty leads to the lowest person-years in agriculture. Policy uncertainty
    causes land rents to become much more volatile compared to climate uncertainty.
    Land rents do not fall to zero, indicating continued profitability.
  22: Climate uncertainty and policy uncertainty both increase mean agricultural income,
    but climate uncertainty leads to higher volatility. Social welfare remains quite
    stable across different uncertainty scenarios.
  23: Uncertainty about future yields has significant effects on production, land
    use, and farm income; Climate change projections lead to higher simulated yields
    and income, but also increased income variance; Consumer surplus largely unaffected
    due to well-functioning trade.
  26: Farmers could reduce policy uncertainty by switching to productions that are
    less subsidized, but these are often less profitable.
  36: Simulated timothy yields vary significantly across locations and climate projections.
  41: Climate and policy uncertainty can significantly impact land and milk quota
    rents, as evidenced by the differences in minimum, maximum, mean, and standard
    deviation values across the different scenarios.
Methodology:
  1: Food production analysis
  2: Weather-driven crop models (CSM-CERES-Wheat and LINGRA) were processed in a stochastic
    version of Jordmod, a price-endogenous spatial economic sector model of the Norwegian
    agriculture. Effects on conditions that represented the projected climate for
    2050 under the emission scenario A1B from the 4th assessment report of the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change and four Global Climate Models (GCM) was investigated.
  4: The paper proposes analyzing the combined effects of uncertainty due to projected
    climate change and potential shifts in agricultural policies on the agricultural
    sector in Norway. The time horizon is until the mid-21st century.
  5: Utilization of agricultural sector models and dynamic crop simulation models
    to simulate responses to policy and environmental changes. Linking economic and
    biogeophysical models is a complex task but has been attempted.
  7: Applied two crop simulation models (CSM-CERES-wheat and LINGRA) and the Jordmod
    farm sector model to evaluate the combined effect of climate change and policy
    uncertainty.
  8: The study uses two crop models, LINGRA and CSM-CERES-wheat, to simulate crop
    yields based on weather and soil data. It also uses Jordmod, a price-endogenous,
    spatial, comparative-static, and partial equilibrium model for the agricultural
    sector in Norway, consisting of supply and market modules.
  10: The paper uses a partial equilibrium model called Jordmod, which is deterministic,
    but the farm optimization component is further developed to handle stochastic
    decision making using a stochastic scenario method. Farmers are modeled as risk-averse
    and make decisions under uncertainty regarding yields and payment rates.
  11: A modeling framework with contrasting climate and policy scenarios is used to
    analyze the effect of climate and policy uncertainty on crop yields, agricultural
    production, land use, and social welfare. The model used is Jordmod, coupled with
    crop models LINGRA and CSM-CERES-wheat.
  12: A model with five runs (N=5) is used for each scenario to span a reasonable
    range of parameters. Parameters include elasticities of demand functions, initial
    amount of demand, transportation costs, and population growth. Discrete points
    are picked at one and three times the standard deviation in both directions, in
    addition to the mean, for grass yields, wheat yields, and payment rates. A uniform
    probability distribution across the five discrete points is assumed.
  14: The study used the LINGRA and CSM CERES-wheat models, run for 100 years of stochastically
    generated weather data (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, evapotranspiration)
    from four GCMs and historical reference climate data, to simulate timothy grass
    yield.
  16: Crop yield simulations (timothy grass and wheat) under climate change scenarios
    are used to adjust yield functions in an economic model (Jordmod). Stochastic
    levels of direct payments are based on past budget support development. The model
    is comparative-static and shifted to represent a future point.
  17: Crop simulation using Jordmod. A medium-range timeframe of 19 years was assumed,
    projecting exogenous parameters to represent the year 2030. Technical progress
    is modelled as an annual reduction in input costs.
  21: The analysis uses scenarios with fixed average climate and policy, climate uncertainty,
    policy uncertainty, and a combination of climate and policy uncertainty to assess
    impacts on agriculture in Norway.
  23: Scenario analysis varying policy and climate within specified ranges to assess
    effects on the agricultural sector.
  25: Static and deterministic equilibrium model that assumes markets clear after
    uncertainty is resolved.
  26: A cascade approach was used, where output from crop models were used as input
    in the economic model, but with no feedback from the economic model to the crop
    models.
  36: Simulation of timothy yield under different climate projections. Statistical
    significance testing (P<0.05) is used to compare means within columns. The results
    are applicable to the specific locations and crop studied (timothy cv Grindstad)
    in Norway. The climate projections are for 2046-65.
  38: Simulations performed using Jordmod model for animal production with considerations
    of certainty, climate uncertainty, policy uncertainty, and their combination.
  41: The analysis uses the Jordmod model to simulate the impact of climate and policy
    uncertainty on profitability measures. The results are applicable to the specific
    context modeled by Jordmod.

  14: The study focused on timothy grass yield in northern Europe and used specific
    soil data relevant to southeastern Norway. The CO2 level was set to 380 ppm for

    refers to the combination of climate and policy uncertainty.
  23: Increased income variance due to climate change may require policies to stabilize
    farm income.

Scenarios:
  12: 'Three scenarios are analyzed: ''climate'' (C), ''policy'' (P), and ''climate
    and policy'' (C&P). The climate scenario studies the impact of uncertainty in
    climate projections on crop yields, with policy rates set at their mean values.
    The policy scenario analyzes the consequence of policy uncertainty with yields
    set equal to the mean yields simulated under different climate conditions for
    2046-65. The combined scenario incorporates both.'
