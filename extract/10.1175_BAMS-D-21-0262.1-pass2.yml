Drivers of Risk:
  3: Increase in the frequency and intensity of high-impact and extreme weather and
    climate events; Exponential population growth and demographic shifts (e.g., urbanization,
    increase in coastal populations); Changing global economy
  6: Population growth, urbanization, movement to coastlines, and global 'just in
    time' manufacturing processes increase exposure and vulnerability to weather,
    climate, water, ocean, and even space hazards.
  12: Changing world leading to an ever-growing need for weather and climate services.
Highlights:
  6: Improved weather insight is expected to generate over $500 billion in additional
    revenue. Public-private partnerships are vital to manage demands for forecasts.
  12: Improved coordination and collaboration among the public and private sectors
    will accelerate skill improvement in weather and climate forecasting. Prevailing
    free and open data sharing has facilitated progress. Increased availability of
    forecast-driven tools facilitates progress in weather- and climate-informed decision-making,
    especially by the commercial sector.
Methodology:
  6: Survey of 1,000 global executives in 15 countries by the IBM Institute for Business
    Value (IBV) in cooperation with Oxford Economics.
  12: The paper discusses improvements in numerical weather prediction (NEWP) systems
    and the need for further advancements, particularly in quantitative precipitation
    forecasting. It also mentions the importance of policy changes, public-private
    sector collaboration, and data sharing among countries.
More Notes:
  3: The article discusses the challenges faced in accelerating advances in weather
    and climate forecasting and proposes a vision for key actions needed across the
    private, public, and academic sectors to reduce the detrimental impacts of weather
    and climate.
  12: The paper points to a growing market for NEWP forecasts and the need to remove
    commercial or other barriers to accessing important datasets to accelerate progress.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Detrimental societal and economic impact of hazardous weather and climate events;
    Relatively large, detrimental impacts of weather and climate on all nations and
    especially on low-income nations.
  6: Improved insight into weather variations would positively impact annual revenue
    growth, potentially exceeding $500 billion (U.S. dollars) across 15 countries
    surveyed.
  12: The paper highlights the growing need for weather and climate services, indicating
    that the value of information is becoming better understood and appreciated, suggesting
    an economic impact related to information services.
Quantitative material:
  6: $500 billion (U.S. dollars) potential annual revenue growth from improved weather
    insights; 93% of executives believe weather insights positively impact revenue;
    68% global urbanization projection by 2050; survey of 1,000 global executives
    in 15 countries.
