    ice sheet sensitivity to change in climate models, convective precipitation beyond
    the short range, closure of the water and energy cycle.
  14: Severe weather such as tornadoes, large hail, and damaging winds; rainfall estimation.
  16: "Increases in observational datasets, the movement of NEWP systems to ensembles\
    \ operating at high resolution (1\u20133 km), and attempts to observe and predict\
    \ more components of the Earth system. Lack of investment in long-term maintenance\
    \ and capacity building in low-income countries."

    components as well as the land surface, including surface hydrology and wetlands,
    lakes, and human activities.
  10: The WMO plays a critical role in fostering data sharing for weather and climate
    forecasting. Private sector activities have grown to include providing global
    satellite-based measurements, targeted high-resolution modeling, and climate risk
    products. Access to regional measurements and private sector observations remains
    a challenge.
  12: Improved coordination among public, private, and academic sectors will accelerate

    datasets to accelerate progress for detailed forecasts across different timescales.
  13: Significant outstanding challenges remain in terms of weather and climate predictive
    skill and includes a list of items.
  14: ML can improve the utilization of observing systems, advance data assimilation,
    better estimate model and observation errors, allow incorporation of complex subgrid
    physical parameterizations, advance postprocessing of numerical variables, estimate
    impacts, advance nowcasting and improve rainfall estimation, detect and forecast
    severe weather, and detect regimes where forecast failures are more likely to
    occur.
  16: Big data challenges are a key dilemma for the NWEP enterprise and society. Downscaling
    forecast data from global ensembles using AI can be highly valuable for national
    impact sectors, especially for low-income countries. Implementing NEWP systems
    with postprocessing, production, and visualization in the cloud may offer a more
    sustainable and cost-effective approach. Stabilizing national observing networks
    in low-income countries is of paramount importance.
  17: Argues that global cooperation can improve regional capacity in meteorological
    disaster monitoring, prediction, and early warning, contributing to sustainable
    development. Recommends investment in academic institutions in low-income countries
    for research, consulting, and training.

    Development Goals by enabling a next generation of weather and climate services
    to better mitigate risks and reduce losses.
