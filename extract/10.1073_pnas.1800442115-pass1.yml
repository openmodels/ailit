Drivers of Risk:
  1: ambient temperature, tropospheric carbon dioxide(CO2) and ozone(O3) concentrations,
    water availability and salinization
  7: Changes in environmental conditions such as increased CO2, tropospheric O3, temperature,
    and extreme events (floods, cyclones, heat waves) affecting vegetable and legume
    yields and nutritional quality.
  8: No relevant information
  9: tropospheric O3, salinity and water availability, tropospheric CO2 and ambient
    temperature
Highlights:
  1: predicted changes in environmental exposures would lead to reductions in the
    yields of non-staple vegetables and legumes. Where adaptation possibilities are
    limited this may substantially change their global availability, affordability
    and consumption in the mid-to long-term.
  7: Reduced vegetable and legume yields and nutritional quality could have substantial
    health impacts and exacerbate existing issues of low vegetable consumption. Negative
    impacts will most affect poorly functioning markets and poor populations.
  8: Identifies potential for substantial impacts from environmental change on global
    non-staple vegetable and pulse legume yields. Connecting research in environment,
    food system and health sectors is valuable to identify challenges for agriculture
    and food systems.
  9: No relevant information
Methodology:
  1: systematically searched for articles published between 1975 and 2016 on the effect
    of ambient temperature, tropospheric carbon dioxide(CO2) and ozone(O3) concentrations,
    water availability and salinization on the yields and nutritional quality of vegetables
    and legumes...estimated the mean effects of standardised environmental changes
    using observed exposure-response relationships and conducted meta-analysis where
    possible.
  7: Meta-analysis was used where possible to support crude analysis on all studies,
    with IPCC AR5 forecasts used to guide standardisation of environmental change
    exposure levels.
  8: Systematic review and meta-analysis (potentially) of field and greenhouse studies
    published between 1975 and 2016 examining the relationship between environmental
    exposures (temperature, CO2, ozone, water availability, salinity) and yields/nutritional
    quality of vegetables and legumes.
  9: "Included papers were grouped by environmental exposure and further subdivided\
    \ by vegetable or legume group...Outcomes from individual experiments \u2013 described\
    \ in included papers \u2013 were standardised to a fixed change in environmental\
    \ exposure level...The Huber (sandwich) estimate of variance (32) was used to\
    \ adjust for the clustered nature of the data using each paper as cluster unit.\
    \ Data from papers that provided estimates of precision (13.8% of all included\
    \ papers) were used to calculate pooled effects using meta-analysis."
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the yields and nutritional quality of non-staple vegetables
    and legumes, not starchy staples. It emphasizes the need for agricultural developments
    to minimize potential reductions in vegetable and legume yields and associated
    negative health effects.
  7: Increased visible bruising of vegetables due to raised tropospheric O3 may reduce
    market value and agricultural revenue. Heat stress could affect producers directly
    and cause reduced labour productivity.
  8: The review focuses on agricultural impacts, specifically vegetable and legume
    yields and nutritional quality, not directly on macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes at a national level. However, the findings could indirectly inform economic
    models by providing data on agricultural productivity changes under different
    climate scenarios.
  9: This paper focuses on the impacts of climate change factors on vegetable and
    legume yields and nutritional quality, which could have macroeconomic or fiscal
    implications, but are not directly addressed on this page.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  7: Potential health impacts of reductions in non-staple vegetable and legume consumption,
    which could increase risk of non-communicable diseases and nutrient deficiencies,
    indirectly affecting labor productivity and economic output.

Quantitative material:
  1: "The mean[95%confidence interval] reported yield changes(all vegetables and legume\
    \ groups combined) were +22.0%[+11.6 to+32.5] for 250ppm increase in CO2 concentration;\
    \ -8.9% [-15.6 to-2.2] for 25% increase in O3 concentration;-34.7%[-44.6 to-24.9]\
    \ for 50% reduction in water availability; and -2.3%[-3.7 to -0.9] for 25% increase\
    \ in salinity. In papers with baseline temperatures >20\xB0C, exposure to 4\xB0\
    C increase in temperature reduced mean yields(-31.5%[-41.4 to-21.5])."
  7: Meta-analysis was limited due to only 14% of papers reporting precision estimates.
  8: No relevant information
  9: "crude summary impact estimates (\u201Cmean changes\u201D) with 95% confidence\
    \ intervals were calculated"
