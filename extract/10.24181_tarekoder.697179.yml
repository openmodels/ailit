Drivers of Risk:
  1: No relevant information
  2: GDP per capita, gross fixed capital formation, agricultural labor force rate
    (% of total labor force), rate of urbanization (% of total population), rule of
    law index, political stability index
  7: Structural changes in the Turkish economy shifting employment from agriculture
    to industry and services, though increasing population necessitates increased
    agricultural productivity.
  8: Carbon emissions (CO2 emissions) are noted, with the long-term analysis finding
    that an increase in agricultural value-added reduces emissions.
  18: Gross domestic product per capita, gross fixed capital formation, agricultural
    labor ratio (% of total labor force), urbanization rate (% of total population),
    political stability and rule of law index
  19: Agricultural workforce ratio (% of total labor force); urbanization rate (%
    of total population); rule of law index; political stability
Highlights:
  1: Positive relationship between agricultural value added and GDP per capita, gross
    fixed capital formation, agricultural labor ratio, and urbanization ratio; Negative
    relationship with rule of law index; No significant relationship with political
    stability index
  2: GDP per capita, gross fixed capital formation, agricultural labor force rate,
    and urbanization rate have a significant and positive relationship with value-added
    agriculture. Rule of law index has a significant but negative relationship with
    value-added agriculture. No statistically significant relationship was found between
    value-added agriculture and political stability index.
  7: Agriculture's share of GDP in Turkey decreased from 9% in 2010 to 6.1% in 2017,
    but rose slightly to 6.4% in 2019. Despite the decrease, Turkey ranked 8th globally
    and 1st in Europe in terms of agricultural added value in 2017.
  8: The studies found that agricultural value-added impacts per capita income and
    has a two-way causality relationship with government effectiveness. It's also
    associated with a reduction in long-term carbon emissions.
  14: There is a statistically significant positive relationship between agricultural
    value added and GDP per capita, gross fixed capital formation, agricultural labor
    force ratio, and urbanization ratio.
  18: The study investigates the determinants of value-added agriculture using panel
    data analysis.
  19: Positive and significant relationship between value-added agriculture and GDP
    per capita, gross fixed capital formation, agricultural workforce ratio, and urbanization
    rate. Significant negative relationship between value-added agriculture and the
    rule of law index. No statistically significant relationship between value-added
    agriculture and political stability.
Methodology:
  1: Panel data analysis using fixed effects model, random effects model, generalized
    method of moments (GMM), system GMM, and robust estimation methods
  2: Panel data analysis method using fixed effects model, random effects model, the
    generalized method of moments (GMM), system GMM and robust (resistive error) estimators
    econometric models.
  8: Panel data analysis is used for the studies, with the application of methods
    like OLS, DOLS, FMOLS, and Granger Causality tests.
  14: The analysis uses fixed effects, random effects, GMM, and system GMM estimation
    methods to assess determinants affecting agricultural value added.
  18: Panel data analysis (fixed effects model, random effects model, generalized
    moments method, system GMM, and robust estimators) for 20 countries (Brazil, Turkey,
    France, the United States of America, Britain, Indonesia, Malaysia, Russia, Germany,
    China, Australia, India, South Africa, Italy, Spain, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands,
    Nigeria, Romania) for the period 2000-2018
  19: Dynamic GMM (Generalized Moments Method), System GMM, Fixed Effects, Random
    Effects, and Robust models developed by Arrellano & Bond (1991) for panel data
    analysis. Random effects model preferred based on Hausman test.
More Notes:
  1: Study examines determinants of agricultural value added using data from 20 countries
    for 2000-2018; Uses World Bank and governance indicators
  2: The data is sourced from the World Bank (WB) and Worldwide Governance Indicators
    (WGI) websites.
  7: The text mentions the importance of agricultural productivity for feeding the
    growing population, implying climate change impacts on agricultural productivity
    could have significant macroeconomic consequences, but this is not explicitly
    stated.
  18: The study categorizes the determinants into economic, social, political, and
    legal factors.
  19: The study is limited by the availability of data from official websites for
    the specified time span.

  7: Table 2 shows agricultural GDP in current prices (Bin TL and Bin $) and agriculture's
    share of GDP (%) from 2009-2019. In 2017, agricultural added value was $51.712
    million, ranking Turkey 8th globally and 1st in Europe.
  14: The model explains 88% of the variation in agricultural value added.
