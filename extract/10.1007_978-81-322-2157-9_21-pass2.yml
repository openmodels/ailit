    a challenge for sustaining production in India.
  23: Crop water requirements are generally projected to increase in 2020 and 2050
    compared to 1990. The increase varies by crop and district. Anantapur (AP) for
    groundnut shows a substantial increase in water requirement by 2050 (25.6% change).
  27: The crop growth was significantly superior in biochar-applied plots from all
    three sources in the CRIDA experiment.
  30: No relevant information
  36: Agricultural diversification could improve productivity and soil fertility,
    and reduce over-exploitation of resources like groundwater.
  42: "Significant regime shifts in Orissa's rainfall were observed over the 20th\
    \ century. A structural change was observed in the annual depression in the Bay\
    \ of Bengal. Structural breaks in rainfall during the periods 1901\u20131940 and\
    \ 1941\u20131969 indicated a significant change in both slope and intercepts."
  55: Distribution of rainfall is more important than the amount of rainfall for soybean
    yield.
  56: Delaying the sowing dates would be favourable for increased soybean yields.
  58: Increased temperature significantly decreases soybean yield. Adaptation strategies
    like changing sowing dates can mitigate some of the yield loss. Yield reduction
    in the range of 23 to 13% from normal can be achieved by advancing the sowing
    date.
  59: Advancing sowing dates (before the 10th of July) and increasing plant density
    (from 50 to 60 plants/m2) can mitigate the negative impact of increased temperature
    on soybean yield.
  62: Maximum temperatures above normal affected wheat yield in Northwest India and
    Uttar Pradesh. Late sowing reduces grain yield except in East India.
  69: Late sowing generally reduces wheat yield, but the magnitude of the reduction
    varies depending on location and specific climatic conditions. Grain yield in
    East India is predicted to increase more than in Northwest India; Temperature
    increase negatively impacts yield
  70: Northwest India and Uttar Pradesh experienced lower wheat yields in 2009-2010
    compared to 2008-2009, while East India experienced higher yields. Late sown conditions
    predicted yield reductions, especially in Uttar Pradesh (~36%).
  91: Seasonal ARIMA models are a viable tool for forecasting temperature, humidity,
    and precipitation. The study suggests frequent updating of the model may not be
    necessary if a sufficient length of data is used in model building.
  94: Temperature rise will benefit apple orchards at high altitudes, but varied terrain
    requires geospatial analysis for region-specific understanding.
  98: Climate change is expected to shift apple growing areas to higher elevations
    in Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir by 2050. The GARP model showed a good
    fit (92%) with the actual niche under current conditions.
  99: The study predicts a significant change in suitable growing environment for
    apple orchards in the future, with a shift to higher elevation ranges in J&K and
    HP.
  109: Rubber dam installation significantly increased crop productivity and cropping
    intensity, leading to enhanced gross returns for farmers.
  113: Frequent drought and flood occurrences in the last 25 years affected the paddy
    yield.
  115: July rainfall is decreasing during the global warming era, which is critical
    for monsoon crops. Drought years have increased since 1971. Annual rainfall shows
    an increasing trend, but rainfall has decreased during the active monsoon months
    of July and August. Increased run-off is associated with increased variability,
    making wet periods more uncertain and highlighting more frequent monsoon droughts.
  119: Severe drought in October to December affected paddy yield adversely; Uneven
    rainfall distribution negatively impacts crop yield; despite canal irrigation,
    water is unavailable during critical growth stages.
  122: ICTs offer opportunities for rapid and efficient information transfer, increasing
    the profitability of farms. Extension service should reach smallholder farmers
    for sustainable agriculture.
  154: Climate change will only accentuate impacts. Changing temperatures will have
    a profound effect on the plants and animals. Crops that flourished will have to
    adapt to the new one and will increasingly loose of yields and milch cattle, especially
    cross-breed cows will lose on milk yield.
  155: Low agricultural growth (2-3%) compared to other sectors (8%) contributes to
    the rural-urban divide and makes farming unattractive.
  156: Need for integrated efforts and public leadership to convert drought-prone
    areas and other challenges into opportunities for agricultural and economic growth.
  160: Gujarat experienced a major turnaround in agriculture after 2004, achieving
    an 11% annual growth rate and becoming a front-runner in agricultural production,
    Dahod district achieved food security and improved socio-economic conditions after
    being designated the poorest district in India.
  163: Climate change leads to declined wheat production and increased rice production
    in some regions of India; magnitude of impacts varies geographically.
  164: "Climate change is likely to significantly impact Indian agriculture, especially\
    \ wheat production, with a loss of 4-5 million tons for every 1\xB0C rise in temperature."
  165: Significant climate change-induced profit losses are projected for Indian agriculture,
    with the study highlighting both controlled and uncontrolled variables impacting
    outcomes.
  171: Temperature has an inverted U-shape relationship with yield. Rainfall also
    appears to have a similar relationship to yield.
  173: Climate change can lead to significant yield losses in rice production, particularly
    in lower productivity districts and specific regions.
  175: The importance of developing a multifaceted adaptation policy for agriculture
    that is not restricted to a single approach.
  176: Wheat production losses are likely in the most productive districts; rice impacts
    of uniform warming are mildly positive in the least productive areas
  179: Climate change/variability on agricultural impacts in Northwest Himalayas have
    not received much adequate attention.
  181: Moderate to extreme drought severity has been pronounced for the Himalayan
    region, even with the overall increase in precipitation. Flooding is projected
    to increase.
  183: White grubs cause significant crop loss in upland rice in hills; Climate change
    affects biotic stress on major crops in NW Himalayas.
  186: Delayed sowing reduces grain yield significantly due to various climate-related
    stresses. Specific crop varieties show different responses to sowing dates, with
    some performing better under late sown conditions. Extreme weather events significantly
    affect cropped areas.
  187: Extreme weather events significantly impact crop yields and fodder availability
    in India, particularly affecting hill crops.
  190: Climate change is impacting climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture in Rajasthan,
    leading to crop failures and yield reductions.
  193: Mean temperature has increased from 0.2 to 1.6 /C14C from 1998 onwards; significant
    decadal variability in monsoon rains.
  195: Climate change impacts on agriculture include reduced crop yields and increased
    agricultural problems (e.g., pests, diseases, weeds) in Rajasthan.
  199: Tmax increased in most agro-climatic zones except north-western, southern,
    and Cauvery Delta zones. Tmin increased in most agro-climatic zones except north-western
    and Cauvery Delta zones. THI showed varying growth patterns across zones.
  229: Projected climate change will disturb the hydrological balance and quality
    of groundwater in coastal regions of India.
  230: Climate change is occurring more quickly than previously anticipated; Changes
    to polar ice, glaciers, and rainfall regimes have already occurred.
  231: The study suggests increased summer river flow followed by severe reduction
    due to glacier melt.
  233: Agriculture is the largest consumer of water in India, and demand from the
    farm sector can be pegged at 68% by the year 2050 with judicious utilization.
  236: Groundwater extraction is primarily for irrigation. Groundwater development
    is highly uneven across the country. A significant portion of assessment units
    are categorized as 'overexploited' or 'critical' concerning groundwater resources.
  238: Climate change can affect both the input and output of groundwater resources,
    influencing quantity and quality. Significant groundwater resources exist in deeper
    confined aquifers, particularly in the Ganga-Brahmaputra alluvial plains.
  245: Emphasis on encouraging crop and livelihood diversification and rural income
    flow protection to manage climate risks.
  247: Weather-based agro-advisories and weather insurance are beneficial in reducing
    impacts on farmers.

    to climate change and other factors and reports on a conference discussing these
    issues. It mentions a synthesis volume compiling research papers with analytical
    and policy planning perspectives.
  23: The data focuses on crop water requirements, a key factor impacting agricultural
    productivity. This could be linked to macroeconomic outcomes through agricultural
    output and its contribution to GDP, however this is not stated explicitly in the
    paper.
  27: The text advocates for policy initiatives related to mainstreaming adaptations,
    facilitating scientific pricing policies, considering financial incentives for
    improved land management, and establishing a 'Green Research Fund'.
  30: The paper focuses on agricultural diversification in India as a means to address
    challenges in the agricultural sector and provide a safety net for farmers, but
    does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks of climate change,

    and benefits. However, the changes in rainfall patterns and cyclonic disturbances
    are important drivers of economic impacts. The paper focuses on the state of Orissa.
  43: The methodology section is purely statistical, focusing on a test for structural
    changes in time series data. It uses rainfall as an example, but the methods themselves
    are generic and could be applied to economic or fiscal variables if those were
    the subject of analysis.
