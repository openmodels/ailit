Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change due to global warming impacting tropical cyclones (TCs), Baiu,
    precipitation, and seasonal storms. TC activity is particularly important for
    natural disasters in East Asia.
  9: Increased occurrence frequency of extreme rainfall during the Baiu season in
    Japan due to climate change. Also, increased frequency of Guerrilla-heavy rainfall
    events during August around the Kansai region of Japan. These are driven by the
    RCP8.5 scenario and changes in SST.
  11: Increased frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events and floods due
    to climate change (specifically, future changes in river discharges).
  12: Changes in annual maximum 24-h rainfall and river discharge, driven by climate
    change (represented by a 4-degree SST rise experiment).
  13: Sea level rise, tropical cyclones (TCs) and seasonal storms leading to changes
    in storm surge and extreme wind speeds are drivers of coastal hazards.
  16: Climate change (increased TC intensity, sea level rise); Storm surge; Ambiguity
    in storm surge risk projections (insufficient knowledge of TC systems).
  17: Typhoons, Baiu precipitation, Guerrilla-heavy rainfall, extreme river flooding,
    storm surges, and extreme waves exacerbated by climate change (warmer climate
    condition, increased convective available potential energy, atmospheric destabilization).
  18: Climate change impacts (specifically, the need for a 1 m dike rise mitigation
    policy) drive risk as shown in the increased values under 'future conditions'.
  19: Increased rainfall, typhoons, precipitation induced flooding, guerrilla-heavy
    rainfall, river hazards, coastal hazards, and changes to water resources drive
    risk.
Highlights:
  1: Reviews recent climate change impact assessments and summarizes the projected
    future changes in precipitation, river flooding, and coastal hazards, and their
    associated economic impacts.
  9: Projects an increasing trend in both the occurrence frequency and intensity (accumulated
    amount) of extreme rainfall events (Baiu and Guerrilla-heavy rainfall) in Japan
    under future climate scenarios (RCP8.5). The increase in extreme rainfall is driven
    by both thermodynamic (increased water vapor) and dynamical (strengthened rain-band
    formation) effects.
  11: Extreme rainfall and river discharge are projected to increase significantly
    in several major river basins in Japan, indicating increased flood risk in the
    future. The d4PDF model matches well with observational data in many river basins,
    but biases exist in the southern part of Japan, potentially related to Tropical
    Cyclone behavior and spatial resolution.
  12: Flood damages are expected to increase with climate change. The exceedance probability
    of high flood damage costs (e.g., 800 billion JPY) can be significantly higher
    in the future climate.
  13: "Global future changes of storm surge will be severe within 15\u201335\u25E6\
    N in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in East Asia. Changes in extreme storm\
    \ surges depend on the length of the return periods."
  16: Risk and uncertainty premiums are not negligible in size and occur unevenly
    among areas where there is risk of flood damage; Risk and uncertainty premiums
    cannot be ignored when evaluating the economic value of a policy that mitigates
    storm surge flood risk under ambiguity.
  17: Flood risk will seriously increase with large variability; Economic value of
    a dike rising policy under ambiguity was estimated to mitigate storm surge risk
    in Osaka Bay, Japan; Risk and uncertainty premiums cannot be ignored when evaluating
    the economic value of a policy that mitigates storm surge flood risk under ambiguity.
  18: Future conditions show increased expected loss reductions, risk premiums, and
    uncertainty premiums compared to current conditions, suggesting a greater financial
    burden associated with coastal hazards in the future.
  19: Increased rainfall and typhoons lead to increased hazard projection and risk
    assessments. There are increases in extreme storms, river discharge, coastal surges,
    and changes to water resources.
Methodology:
  1: Collaborative research program in Japan projecting long-term changes in natural
    hazards in Japan and East Asia based on local-scale and large-ensemble numerical
    experiments. Reviews recent climate change impact assessments (written in both
    English and Japanese) from the program.
  9: Downscaling global climate models (MRI-AGCM 3.2S) to regional models (NHRCM05)
    and using PGW experiments with a cloud resolving numerical model to project future
    rainfall patterns. The analyses use different SST patterns to drive ensemble members
    and compare present-day and future climate simulations. Multi-polarimetric weather
    radar data is used alongside NHRCM05 data to project Guerrilla-heavy rainfall.
  11: Analysis of future changes in extreme rainfall events and floods using a hydrological
    model with O(100 m) resolution forced with d4PDF (database for Policy Decision-making
    for Future climate change). Statistical comparison of rainfall distributions using
    the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test.
  12: Flood risk curves are derived using the d4PDF historical and future (4-degree
    SST rise) experiments, spanning 60 years with 50 historic and 90 future ensemble
    experiments, focusing on the Yodo River basin in Japan. The probability of exceedance
    is assessed for specific flood damage levels.
  13: Uses d4PDF dataset (long-term ensemble projections of historical and future
    climate conditions) to examine changes to extreme wind speeds and storm surges.
  16: Used the Global Stochastic Tropical Cyclone Model to generate TC simulations
    in Osaka Bay; Applied a fully-coupled surge-wave-tide model (SUWAT) to predict
    storm surges and calculate flood depths; Repeated the process 25 times to obtain
    25 PDFs of storm surge flood risk; Implemented a web-based survey using a Limited
    Degree of Confidence (LDC) model to estimate preferences on risk and ambiguity.
  17: Uses scenario-based (GHGE) GCM climate projections (mainly d4PDF) and PGW experiments;
    Estimates general public preferences on risk and ambiguity of storm surge risk;
    Evaluates the economic value of a mitigation policy for reducing storm surges
    based on estimated preferences.
  18: 'The study uses d4PDF and PGW (pseudo-global warming) experiments, combining
    both to assess the impacts of extreme events. Bias correction of climate projections
    is mentioned as essential. The case study is based in Osaka Bay, Japan and applies
    to a 1 m dike rise mitigation policy. '
  19: Climate projection is performed using Global Circulation Models (GCM) and Regional
    Climate Models (RCM). Hazard projection identifies climate-related hazards. Impact
    assessment evaluates social and economic damages.
