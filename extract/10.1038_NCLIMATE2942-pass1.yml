Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in temperature and precipitation (increased aridity)
  2: Changes in aridity.
  3: Changes in grassland fCover driven by the combined effect of temperature-driven
    evaporation and changes in precipitation frequency and intensity.
  4: "Warmer and wetter winters and springs in northern grasslands; Decreases of up\
    \ to 25 \xB138/9mm in spring precipitation in southern grasslands; Concomitant\
    \ increase in temperature and evaporation in southern grasslands."
Highlights:
  1: North American grasslands are projected to experience widespread increases in
    vegetation fractional cover despite increased aridity, due to shifts in growth
    patterns towards earlier spring emergence and delayed autumn senescence compensating
    for drought-induced reductions in summer.
  2: "The ensemble trend in fCover was positive over most of the study area. Significant\
    \ increases in fCover (one-sample t-test, H0:\xB5=0, p< 0.001)."
  3: Overall trend in fCover varied among regions; regional patterns were typically
    driven by trends in precipitation.
  4: Climate change is projected to cause increases in grassland productivity in northern
    regions and decreases in southern regions, with an overall positive trend in GPP
    across North America.
Methodology:
  1: "A coupled vegetation\u2013hydrological model is used, constrained by daily measures\
    \ of vegetation greenness (green chromatic coordinate) derived from PhenoCam network\
    \ imagery. Model validated using aboveground net primary productivity data and\
    \ satellite-derived fCover. Climate projections are based on CMIP5 climate projections\
    \ for a business-as-usual scenario (RCP 8.5)."
  3: Ensemble mean of ten CMIP5 climate projections used to model changes in grassland
    fCover between 2010-2020 and 2090-2100.
  4: Modelled annual fCover (fraction of land covered by vegetation) and ANPP (aboveground
    net primary production) of tallgrass prairie, using regressions and climate models;
    GPP (gross primary productivity) estimated as fCover scaled to GPP.
More Notes:
  1: The model does not include the effects of rising atmospheric CO2 on photosynthesis
    and water use efficiency, so impacts on grassland productivity may be even larger
    than results suggest.
  2: The study focuses on grassland fCover and aridity changes but does not explicitly
    link these to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  4: The model does not account for the effects of elevated CO2 on productivity. Results
    represent an underestimate of productivity in the case where CO2 concentration
    increases and remains unaddressed in this study.

Quantitative material:
  1: Widespread increases in grassland fCover over the coming century across the majority
    of North American grasslands, despite increased aridity.
  2: Model explained 75% of the observed temporal variability in daily fCover (p<
    0.001, RMSE =0.17).
  3: "The integrated annual grassland fCover of 18 \xB114/9% across the grassland\
    \ ecosystems in North America"
  4: "A mean increase in annual GPP of 76 \xB177gCm\u22122 (mean \xB11 s.d., across\
    \ all climate models) by 2100 at the Lethbridge site, representing a 15% increase;\
    \ Projected average growing season increase of 4 \xB12 weeks; Estimated total\
    \ annual grassland GPP increase of 52 \xB155/38gCm\u22122 or 0.11 \xB10.08 Pg\
    \ (76\xB157/28gCm\u22122 or 0.08 \xB10.06 Pg C, for areas with a significant change)."
