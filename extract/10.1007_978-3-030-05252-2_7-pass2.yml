Drivers of Risk:
  17: Deep uncertainties are a given in long-term decisionmaking.
  50: Coordination failures, increasing returns to scale, imperfect information, and
    heterogeneous preferences impacting technology diffusion; adoption of emission-reducing
    technologies.
  51: Deeply uncertain factors, including the macroeconomic effects of potentially
    distortionary taxes and subsidies on economic growth, the microeconomic preferences
    that agents use to make technology adoption decisions, the future cost and performance
    of technologies, the way information about new technologies flows through agent
    networks, and the impacts of climate change.
  52: "Uncertainties related to coordination failures slowing technology diffusion\
    \ (rate of cost reductions for non-emitting technologies, rate at which agents\
    \ learn about new technologies, agents\u2019 risk aversion, agents\u2019 price-performance\
    \ preferences) and damages from climate change."
  53: Potential for coordination failures and impacts from climate change are key
    uncertainties.
  54: Market imperfections are likely to inhibit the diffusion of new, emissions-reducing
    technologies or that the impacts of climate change will turn out to be serious.
  72: Reduction of landside accessibility of the airport, resistance from Schiphol
    stakeholders (environmental groups, residents), rise of self-hubbing, rise of
    the airport city, air transport demand developments, KLM potentially moving operations
    to Charles de Gaulle Airport, uncertainty about the future of the hub-and-spoke
    network structure
  73: Climate change affecting wind conditions and demand for air traffic
  74: Climate change (leading to more frequent southwesterly wind conditions impacting
    Schiphol's hourly capacity)
  76: Demand for air traffic growing faster or slower than forecast; Collapse or departure
    of the hub carrier (KLM); Rise of long-haul low-cost carriers; Rise of self-hubbing;
    Increase of noise or emissions from aircraft.
  77: Increase in population density affected by noise; Change in the valuation of
    externalities by the public; Other major airports in Europe increase capacity;
    Development of wind conditions due to climate change

    planning deviations.
  113: Variations in the precise shapes of cams due to manufacturing differences,
    leading to uncertainty in the stiffness coefficient.
  115: Uncertainty in the stiffness 'K' of the system, represented by a horizon of
    uncertainty 'h'.
  118: "Uncertainty in the estimation of stiffness (\u02DCK), represented by the estimated\
    \ error 's', is a driver of risk. Changes in the putative stiffness itself (\u02DC\
    K) also drive changes in robustness and opportuneness."
  119: Uncertainty in the stiffness (K) of the system, especially for innovative designs.
  122: Uncertainty in the probability distribution functions (pdfs) of performance
    metric K, modeled using an info-gap approach. The uncertainty is represented by
    a horizon of uncertainty, h.
  133: Uncertainty in future demand
  148: The reliability of the Colorado River Basin system is increasingly threatened
    by rising demand and deeply uncertain future supplies. Recent climate research
    suggests that future hydrologic conditions in the Colorado River Basin could be
    significantly different from those of the recent historical period.
  150: "Future water demand, streamflow under different climate regimes (using resampled\
    \ historical, paleoclimate, and downscaled global climate model projections),\
    \ drought. Specifically, long-term average streamflow at Lee Ferry falling below\
    \ 15 maf and an eight-year drought with average flows below 13 maf can lead to\
    \ Lower Basin vulnerability. Climate conditions leading to these streamflow conditions\
    \ include historical periods with less than average precipitation, or projected\
    \ climate conditions (at least 2\xB0F warmer) in which precipitation is less than\
    \ 105% of the historical average."
  153: Declining Supply conditions
  154: "Colorado River long-term stream\uFB02ow, inability to predict future conditions"
  156: Declining streamflows are a driver of risk.
  159: Speed and extent of future climate change; pace and scope of future technological
    development.
  161: Interactions across the fossil and sustainable energy technologies, climate
    model responses (scenarios), technological factors (seven are noted in Table 7.2
    but not specified on this page).
  162: R&D returns and climate uncertainty, particularly different climate change
    scenarios.
  165: Climate sensitivity (low, medium, high), innovation propensity (high, low),
    transferability, R&D returns, substitution, and environmental regulation cost
    thresholds.
  173: Uncertainty regarding large-scale implementation effects of intelligent speed
    adaptation (ISA)
  176: The text identifies uncertainties, such as liability if the system fails, driver
    acceptance, and effects of different implementation strategies.
  194: Uncertainty and changing climate risk profiles
  200: "The drivers of risk are varying climate change scenarios (High Emissions (A2)\
    \ median, High Emissions (A2) 90th percentile, Low Emissions (2\xB0C) median)\
    \ leading to different flood discharge levels."
  201: Climate change affecting flood flows.
  209: "Changes in the global climate, effects on the planet\u2019s eco-system, and\
    \ potential consequences for human activity."
  217: Uncertainty in the geometry of the latch, specifically the length and width.
  223: "Model variables (E; G; v; \u03C1; U Contact; F OS) deviating from their nominal\
    \ values due to 'real-world conditions' differing from simulation settings."
  233: Uncertainty about future demand for new technologies in new markets; Uncertainty
    about the economies of scale for the proposed system; Uncertainty in the learning
    rate associated with implementing modular plants.
  236: "Uncertain LNG demand, economies of scale factor (\u03B1)."
  238: Uncertainty in demand.
  240: Uncertainty in design choices, specifically related to timing and location
    of adaptation measures.
  241: Uncertainty concerning the intensity of economies of scale and learning rates
  242: Deep overall uncertainty
  243: No relevant information
  247: Mean sea level rise (+35 cm to +85 cm by 2100 relative to 2015); Mean winter
    precipitation increase (+4.5% to +30% by 2100 relative to 2015); Uncertainty in
    water heights associated with flood return periods; Natural variability in precipitation;
    Uncertainty in the precipitation-canal inflow relationship.
  250: Sea level rise and precipitation change scenarios; Uncertain future conditions
    affecting the adequacy of physical systems; Performance exceeding a threshold
  251: Sea level rise and precipitation levels.
  252: 'Two extreme scenarios: Low Sea Level / Low Precipitation and High Sea Level
    / Extreme Precipitation.'
  253: "Sea level rise, future conditions, decisionmakers\u2019 belief about the future,\
    \ willingness to bear high-cost worst-case outcomes, discount rates."
  254: High sea level scenario leading to flood risk.
  267: Climate changes and other relevant external factors relevant to the specific
    decision problem are considered as uncertainties. These will vary based on the
    specific decision problem.
  272: Temperature Increase and Precipitation Decrease are used as drivers of climate
    change affecting the system performance.
  274: Climate projections under a specific emissions scenario; sensitivity to certain
    future scenarios.
  278: Changes in climate affecting water availability in the Upper Colorado and Arkansas
    River Basins.
  286: Changes in annual temperature and precipitation due to climate change; increased
    water demand (Build-Out scenario - although considered unacceptable on its own,
    is a risk driver). Model correlations are also considered as a risk driver.
  327: 60% of the Netherlands is flood prone, making flood risk management an existential
    issue. Climate change is a risk driver.
  328: Climate change causing sea level rise and increased winter precipitation, with
    socio-economic factors like population growth and ongoing economic growth.
  330: Hurricane Katrina, flooding of the Rhine and Meuse river system, scientifically
    indisputable changes in the climate and extreme weather conditions.
  333: The need for adaptation measures was driven by the risk of flooding and climate
    change impacts in The Netherlands.
  337: Not explicitly stated, but implied is climate change and the need for adaptation
    measures.
  345: The system integrity may be impacted by periodic, tacit, and stochastic triggers.
  349: Climate change, deep uncertainty about future climate conditions (e.g., whether
    overinvesting in adaptation measures), potential failure of adaptation measures,
    societal preferences, research and innovation.
  384: Climate and hydraulics interact with slow-moving dynamics that may take decades
    to show outcomes but can result in sudden, catastrophic loss, impacting observation
    and adaptation strategies.
  404: New information becoming available; the situation changes.
Highlights:
  17: Ignoring deep uncertainty is attractive but leads to decisions that ignore reality,
    potentially leading to much higher prices in the longer term. It is possible to
    make good decisions in the face of deep uncertainty.
  35: RDM identifies a robust mix of policy instruments (carbon taxes and technology
    subsidies) for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and highlights RDM's approach
    to adaptive strategies, agent-based modeling, and complex systems.
  50: 'Compared four strategies: No Action, Taxes Only, Subsidies Only, and Combined
    (taxes and subsidies) based on pvGDP and greenhouse gas emissions.'
  52: Taxes Only and Combined (taxes and subsidies) strategies consistently perform
    better than No Action and Subsidies Only strategies.
  53: Combined strategy (price instruments and technology subsidies) generally performs
    better than Taxes Only, No Action, or Subsidies Only, except when the potential
    for coordination failures and the impacts from climate change are small. Taxes
    Only performs best in the case of small coordination failures and small impacts
    from climate change. The Combined strategy is considered more robust over a wider
    range of plausible futures.
  54: Strategies combining both carbon taxes and technology incentives may be a promising
    component of a robust strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
  64: DAP combines immediate actions with commitments to shape the future and actions
    that preserve flexibility.
  72: Schiphol airport can address vulnerabilities and capitalize on opportunities
    by implementing strategies related to landside accessibility, stakeholder engagement,
    self-hubbing passenger services, non-aeronautical real estate development, and
    adapting to potential shifts in airline operations and network structures.
  73: The analysis focuses on potential operational adjustments at Schiphol Airport
    in response to various aviation demand and competition scenarios
  74: Schiphol should have plans ready for building a sixth runway to hedge against
    the potential impact of climate change leading to more frequent southwesterly
    wind conditions that reduce hourly capacity.
  76: The table outlines a dynamic adaptive planning approach for Schiphol airport,
    triggered by various factors impacting air traffic demand, airline presence, and
    environmental impact.
  77: Long-term plans must be adaptive due to profound uncertainties; Plans should
    combine time-urgent actions with actions that shape the future and preserve flexibility;
    DAP confronts the reality that traditional plans need adjustment as the world
    changes
  91: The system is already performing unacceptably (ATP reached in 2003 under all
    three climate change scenarios). Some adaptation actions are more effective than
    others; for example, medium-sized ships will only be effective in the short term.
    Small-scale dredging is less effective in the high-end climate change scenario.
  92: Small dredging presents a long-term viable adaptation option for climate futures,
    but with variability in impact.
  93: Small-scale dredging is preferred in the short term. Pathways 6-8 are the preferred
    pathways due to their low costs, deferred investments, benefits, and limited negative
    co-benefits.
  95: DAPP helps challenge societies to prepare for potentially large future changes.
  97: Transfer costs can significantly increase the economic costs associated with
    certain pathways, making them less attractive.  The timing of adaptation tipping
    points (ATP) and the discount rate are particularly sensitive.
  98: Challenges remain in demonstrating the value of DAPP to practitioners and policymakers.
    Further application of DAPP to resource-constrained local planning challenges
    is needed. Economic evaluation of pathways is not straightforward and is sensitive
    to the discount rate and timing of tipping points. Studies into appropriate monitoring
    signals are at a nascent stage.
  103: Info-Gap Decision Theory offers robustness and opportuneness as decision concepts.
    Robustness is the greatest horizon of uncertainty up to which an alternative satisfies
    critical outcome requirements. Opportuneness is the lowest horizon of uncertainty
    at which a decision enables better-than-anticipated outcomes. The robustness strategy
    maximizes immunity to error or surprise, differing from outcome optimization.
  104: IG theory is useful when probability distributions are not known or reliable,
    especially when knowledge is expected to improve in the future, processes are
    changing in poorly known ways, or important factors are beyond one's knowledge
    or control.
  109: A decision, policy, action, or system is highly robust against uncertainty
    if it is strong in some or all of the five attributes (resilience, redundancy,
    flexibility, adaptiveness, comprehensiveness); it has low robustness if it is
    weak in all of them.
  113: Clever mechanical design can circumvent the complex nonlinearity of Eq. (5.1)
    to achieve a linear force-displacement relationship (F=Kx).
  115: "There is a trade-off between robustness and performance: stricter performance\
    \ requirements (higher x_c) lead to lower robustness (lower \u02C6\u02DCh(x_c)).\
    \ The robustness becomes zero when the critical displacement x_c equals the predicted\
    \ displacement based on the best estimate of the system parameters (zeroing property)."
  118: "Robustness and opportuneness are sympathetic with respect to changes in stiffness\
    \ (\u02DCK): increasing stiffness makes both worse, and decreasing stiffness makes\
    \ both better. Conversely, robustness and opportuneness are antagonistic with\
    \ respect to the error (s) in the estimated stiffness: reducing the error increases\
    \ robustness but diminishes opportuneness, and vice versa."
  119: Innovative options may offer better performance under ideal conditions, but
    their higher uncertainty can lead to lower robustness compared to state-of-the-art
    options. There is a trade-off between performance and robustness.
  122: "The trade-off between required probability of failure (Pc) and robustness\
    \ (\u02C6h(Pc)) is highlighted: lower required probability of failure entails\
    \ lower robustness. A discontinuous jump in robustness to infinity occurs when\
    \ Pc equals twice the estimated failure probability, due to constraints on the\
    \ pdfs in the info-gap model. Robustness becomes zero when the performance requirement\
    \ Pc equals the estimated value Pf(\u02DCp)."
  123: Info-gap analysis is particularly useful when choosing between innovative,
    uncertain alternatives and more standard options.
  128: EOA explicitly supports the requirements of stakeholders to understand the
    range of possible outcomes, appreciate the likelihood, timing, and location of
    events, have information about extreme possibilities and benefits versus costs,
    and obtain insights into the best strategy.
  132: EOA is designed to directly inform decisionmakers and stakeholders quantitatively
    about their strategic choices. It provides insights and guidance to support the
    decision-making process, indicating which development strategy is preferable under
    uncertainty.
  133: Uncertainty in future demand leads to substantial risks of loss for a large
    plant; Modular plants reduce this risk, especially if timed to match the actual
    growth of demand; Modular plants can also deal profitably with greater demand
    than expected; A modular strategy, flexible as to the location and timing of modules,
    can provide greater expected gains and lower risks than the default single large
    facility, all at substantial saving of initial capital expenditures (Capex).
  136: EOA is presented as more suitable for planners dealing with deep uncertainty
    compared to ROA, as it allows for understanding the range of possible outcomes
    of any strategy and can address non-monetary objectives like flood risk, morbidity,
    or reliability.
  150: Under current management, both the Upper and Lower Basins may fail to meet
    water delivery reliability objectives under many plausible futures.
  153: Adaptive strategies do not completely eliminate regret. Some strategies underinvest
    in the driest futures and overinvest in the wettest futures.
  154: Adaptive strategies (Baseline and Aggressive) are more balanced in terms of
    regret compared to static strategies (Current Management and Implement All Actions).
    Static strategies have high regret under either high or low streamflow conditions.
    The Baseline strategy has moderate regret in the driest conditions, and the Aggressive
    strategy is low regret under wetter conditions.
  156: The analysis aims to devise a Basin-wide robust adaptive strategy that guides
    the investment of additional water supply yield (or demand reductions) based on
    declining streamflows. The paper presents an example of revising decisionmaker
    beliefs over time for 3 different prior expectations in response to declining
    streamflows and developing pathways for implementing strategies.
  159: RDM can be used to identify robust adaptive policies for promoting international
    decarbonization. The study helps illuminate under what conditions the GCF's investments
    and climate policy can successfully enable the international diffusion of SETs
    and meet the two objectives of the Paris Accord.
  160: The study considered seven different policies in addition to a no-additional
    action baseline, including a mixture of carbon taxes and subsidies for technology,
    research, and development.
  161: EDIAM is used to determine the optimal policy response for mitigating climate
    change, making the system highly path-dependent. Policies shape technology development
    and transfer, reduce GHG emissions, and mitigate climate change.
  162: Higher relative R&D returns can lead to technology productivity parity under
    optimal policies.
  165: No single policy is robust across all futures. Adaptive policies are needed,
    triggered by unfolding climate and technological conditions. Independent carbon
    taxation is a first step, followed by pathways depending on conditions.
  166: Optimal environmental regulation for climate change mitigation is not static
    but dynamic, adapting to changing climate and technological conditions. Different
    cooperation regimes under the GCF are best suited for different combinations of
    climate and technological conditions.
  173: Barriers exist in implementing ISA due to uncertainty, and DAP was used in
    a workshop setting to adapt an implementation plan
  176: One highlight is the decision to use DAP given the higher levels of uncertainty
    and the urgency of the road safety problem.
  200: The analysis identifies six feasible adaptation pathways for flood management,
    each with different costs and environmental, social, and transport impacts. All
    pathways have negative social impacts due to land acquisition.
  201: DAPP enabled a systematic analysis of alternatives and use of ROA to consider
    climate change effects on flood flows, design pathways with future choices, and
    provided flexibility to change course; it also increased staff capability.
  217: The total length (L) and width (WC) of the latch account for approximately
    76% of the total variability of peak-stress predictions.
  223: There is a trade-off between performance requirement (lower peak stress) and
    robustness to uncertainty (tolerable deviation in model variables). More demanding
    requirements are less robust.
  229: EOA can identify conditions under which a strategy is valid across various
    future scenarios, particularly in the context of natural process uncertainty.
  233: Highlights the importance of considering uncertainty in long-term forecasts,
    particularly for new technologies in new markets; Focuses on taking 'more productive
    first steps' rather than achieving a 'perfectly rationalized, complete plan for
    the future'.
  236: Analyses recognizing uncertainty lead to systematically different optimal designs
    than deterministic analyses. Ignoring uncertainty overestimates the value of a
    project. For example, a plant design with an NPV of $84.56 million under deterministic
    analysis has an ENPV of only $61.18 million when uncertainty is considered.
  238: A flexible modular design has a significantly higher ENPV than a fixed design
    under conditions of uncertain demand. The flexible strategy stochastically dominates
    the fixed design.
  239: Flexible design strategies lead to higher NPV outcomes, offering both risk
    reduction and opportunity exploitation.
  240: Flexible adaptation strategies (particularly those involving both time and
    location) can offer higher expected NPV, less downside risk, and greater upside
    potential compared to fixed designs. Learning increases the value of flexibility.
  241: Lower economies of scale and greater learning rates increase the value of flexibility;
    Flexibility offers significant potential, demanding exploration.
  242: Flexible strategies (Timing and Time + place strategies) generally outperform
    the fixed design strategy in terms of Expected NPV, Value at Risk, and Value at
    Gain.
  243: Flexible strategies, particularly those using small modules, are generally
    favored due to less downside risk and the enablement of considerable upside opportunities
    when compared to fixed designs.
  247: The study investigates replacement designs for the IJmuiden pumping station
    under uncertain climate conditions, considering sea level rise and precipitation
    changes. The analysis captures deep uncertainty and probabilistic uncertainty
    by coupling scenarios with stochastic variables.
  250: The study compares alternatives based on Total Cost of Ownership, including
    possible later expansion costs in addition to initial capital costs. Monte Carlo
    simulation is used to account for uncertainty in future scenarios.
  251: Reactive Adaptive and Proactive Flexible designs offer substantial gains compared
    to the traditional Fixed approach for water level management. Proactive Flexible
    solution is more valuable in the riskier scenario.
  252: At a 5.5% discount rate, the Reactive Adaptive design becomes the dominant
    solution due to the reduced advantage of expensive future adaptations.
  253: Proactive Flexible flood defense is cheaper than Fixed because it defers costs.
    Reactive Adaptive is initially cheaper but may have substantial future upgrade
    costs, though these are reduced by discounting. The choice between Reactive Adaptive
    and Proactive Flexible depends on beliefs about the future and willingness to
    bear worst-case outcomes.
  254: Reactive Adaptive design has lower average cost but higher risk (wider range
    of possible outcomes). Fixed design is potentially preferred due to lower risk.
  255: EOA offers tools to structure analysis of complex systems, providing insights
    into which functionalities benefit from a proactive and flexible approach and
    conditions maximizing these benefits.
  256: EOA provides distributions of results, offering insights into worst-case outcomes
    to help identify preferred strategies in the absence of reliable probabilistic
    information.
  263: DS accommodates multi-objective analysis and multiple beliefs on likely future
    states of the world.
  269: The functional relationship derived from the stress test is highlighted as
    extremely powerful in the decision-making process, indicating potential system
    sensitivity or insensitivity to climate changes and other stressors. The stress
    test can reveal if a system is sensitive to even modest climate changes or small
    amounts of population growth, suggesting that proactive measures may be needed
    sooner rather than later. The climate stress test incorporates non-climate factors
    as well.
  272: Stakeholders are most receptive to two-dimensional visualizations of climate
    response surfaces.
  274: The adapted system can be shown to be more robust, performing acceptably over
    more of the future space.
  286: Accounting for intra-family model correlations significantly increases the
    estimated risk to the water utility compared to assuming model independence, highlighting
    the importance of considering model correlations in risk assessments.
  327: The Delta programme plays a central role in climate proofing the Netherlands.
  328: The proposal for the Delta Plan was accepted, and the necessary funding was
    allocated, reflecting a commitment to address long-term climate and water management
    challenges.
  330: Flood safety was identified as one of the most pressing of four issues that
    had to be addressed in the Netherlands.
  333: The page discusses the establishment of the Delta programme and Delta Fund
    with a substantial yearly budget to coordinate adaptive measures for flood protection,
    emphasizing political commitment and public awareness.
  337: ADM can contribute to reducing chances of over- and underinvesting; Keeping
    long-term options open may result in lost income; No legislative barriers hindering
    mutual fine-tuning of measures and ambitions in other policy fields were found.
  345: Emphasis on the importance of monitoring, evaluation, and adaptive strategies
    in response to climate-related triggers.
  347: The Signal Group identified acceleration of Antarctic ice cover deterioration
    and increased frequency/intensity of cloudbursts as developments requiring in-depth
    research and potential strategy adjustments.
  348: The paper discusses the Delta programme's dual-line monitoring (blue line for
    implementation and green line for external developments) to ensure it remains
    'on track' and adapt to new changes.
  349: A robust structure for addressing water-related challenges of climate change
    has been established, including a Delta Act, a Delta Programme Commissioner, and
    a guaranteed budget.
  377: DMDU approaches can provide a common vocabulary between analysts and policymakers
    for policy design and implementation during uncertain times.
  391: DMDU techniques are presented as a way to make 'red-teaming' part of the analytical
    process itself, improving the robustness of policy recommendations. The field
    aims to support governance and decision-making in an environment of deep uncertainty
    and complexity.
  396: DMDU approaches aim to improve the adaptivity and robustness of policies to
    significant changes, helping decision-makers identify when to adapt. They shift
    the focus from predicting specific future states to exploring a broad range of
    futures.
Methodology:
  17: The page discusses including a systematic consideration of deep uncertainty
    in practical decisionmaking and suggests that recent years have seen the birth
    and proliferation of ways to do so. Different approaches and tools can enable
    analysts, planners, and decisionmakers to better recognize, confront, and operate
    effectively given the deep uncertainties present.
  28: Scenario Discovery (SD) identifies combinations of future conditions that distinguish
    cases where a policy or strategy does or does not meet its goals, using a database
    of model runs (e.g., from EM).
  35: Robust Decision Making (RDM) is a set of concepts, processes, and tools that
    use computation to yield better decisions under conditions of deep uncertainty.
    It combines Decision Analysis, Assumption-Based Planning, scenarios, and Exploratory
    Modeling to stress test strategies and identify robust adaptive strategies.
  37: The paper describes Robust Decision Making (RDM), an approach using quantitative
    models and data to explore the consequences of assumptions, expand the range of
    futures considered, craft new responses, and identify tradeoffs, rather than making
    predictions.
  38: 'DA and related fields help answer the question: What constitutes a good decision?'
  40: This paper describes Robust Decision Making (RDM) drawing on Assumption-Based
    Planning (ABP) and Scenario Analysis methodologies. ABP identifies load-bearing
    assumptions that could cause a plan to fail and then links the identification
    of these assumptions to an adaptive planning framework. Scenario analysis uses
    multiple plausible futures to characterize and communicate deep uncertainty.
  41: EM facilitates stress testing and scenario analysis by running models numerous
    times in the forward direction, reducing the requirements for analytic tractability
    and enabling global sensitivity explorations.
  42: RDM explicitly follows a 'deliberation with analysis' learning process where
    stakeholders define objectives and options, analysts generate decision-relevant
    information using system models, and stakeholders revisit their objectives based
    on this quantitative information.
  43: This paper describes the Robust Decision Making (RDM) approach, which involves
    framing the decision, evaluating strategies, vulnerability analysis, tradeoff
    analysis, and developing new strategies across futures. It uses simulation models
    to evaluate proposed strategies across multiple plausible future paths and employs
    statistical Scenario Discovery algorithms to identify key factors distinguishing
    futures where strategies succeed or fail.
  45: Robust Decision Making (RDM) uses scenarios and computer-assisted exploration
    to identify robust strategies that perform well across a wide range of futures,
    considering tradeoffs and vulnerabilities. It involves deliberation with analysis,
    human/machine collaboration, and stress testing of proposed solutions.
  47: The paper discusses Robust Decision Making (RDM) which involves scenario thinking,
    robustness decision criteria, stress testing, and exploratory models. RDM uses
    Scenario Discovery (SD) algorithms to identify combinations of future conditions
    that lead to a plan's success or failure. SD relies on algorithms like PRIM or
    CART combined with principal component analysis.
  49: Example uses the DMDU (Define, Measure, Develop, Deploy) framework.
  50: Agent-based model of technology diffusion linked to a simple macromodel of economic
    growth; Comparison of strategies using regret and a domain criterion for robustness.
  51: An agent-based model with 30 input parameters representing uncertain factors
    including macroeconomic effects of taxes/subsidies, microeconomic preferences
    for technology adoption, cost/performance of technologies, information flow through
    agent networks, and climate change impacts. Exploratory Uncertainty Analysis (EUA)
    is performed to specify uncertainties. A genetic algorithm is used to search for

    conditions of deep uncertainty, integrating Dynamic Adaptive Planning and adaptation
    pathways, and using Adaptation Tipping Points (ATPs) to identify conditions under
    which policies will fail.
  86: 'The paper describes a four-step approach for identifying adaptation pathways:
    (1) problem analysis, (2) identifying adaptation tipping points (ATPs), (3) identifying
    contingent actions and assessing their ATP conditions and timing, and (4) designing
    and evaluating pathways. Step 2 uses scenario inputs to represent uncertainties
    and their development over time to reveal when policy actions are needed. Step
    3 assesses the conditions and timing of ATPs for each action, screening out ineffective
    actions. Step 4 designs and evaluates pathways, including portfolios of actions,
    and summarizes them in a pathway map to identify opportunities, no-regret actions,
    lock-ins, and the timing of actions.'
  87: "Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) are used to explore possible routes\
    \ for alternative actions. Pathways can be developed and explored using models\
    \ (agent-based or multi-objective robust optimization models), serious games,\
    \ stakeholder focus group discussions, or a combination of model-based and group\
    \ discussions. Storylines considering socio-economic and environmental conditions\
    \ and adaptation triggers are also used. Pathways are then evaluated using scorecards,\
    \ cost\u2013benefit analysis, multi-criteria analysis, or engineering options\
    \ analysis."
  91: 'Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) framework is used, including: assessing
    system vulnerabilities and opportunities using a fast Integrated Assessment Meta-Model
    (IAMM) to determine when policies reach an Adaptation Tipping Point (ATP); identifying
    alternative actions; assessing their ATP conditions and timing; and designing
    and evaluating adaptation pathways.  Climate scenarios from the Royal Dutch Meteorological
    Institute (KNMI) are combined with synthetic realizations of annual precipitation
    and evaporation to generate an ensemble of possible futures.'

    Making Under Deep Uncertainty) approach.
  103: Info-Gap Decision Theory is used for prioritizing alternatives and making decisions
    under deep uncertainty, without presuming knowledge of worst-cases or reliable
    probability distributions. It models uncertainty in parameters and functional
    relationships.
  104: This page introduces Info-Gap (IG) theory, a non-probabilistic decision theory
    for prioritizing alternatives and making decisions under deep uncertainty. It
    focuses on satisficing and robustness.
  106: IG robustness assesses how wrong a current model can be before a decision's
    outcome becomes unacceptable. The paper argues that decisions with higher robustness
    to uncertainty are preferable.
  107: Info-Gap Decision Theory (IG) analysis assesses robustness to uncertainty using
    a model, performance requirements, and an uncertainty model. The framing can be
    exploratory or advanced, and decisions can be short-term, long-term, or adaptive
    strategies. Robustness against uncertainty is evaluated by combining the model,
    performance requirements, and the uncertainty model.
  109: 'The paper introduces Info-Gap Decision Theory (IG) and discusses five conceptual
    proxies for robustness against uncertainty: resilience, redundancy, flexibility,
    adaptiveness, and comprehensiveness. It uses a qualitative approach with no mathematical
    models in this section.'
  113: Info-Gap Decision Theory is mentioned as a framework to explore robustness
    to uncertainty. Probabilistic model is also mentioned. The application is in the
    context of a mechanically linearized gap-closing electrostatic actuator, but the
    text indicates that robustness to uncertainty in the stiffness coefficient 'K'
    will be explored. Robustness to uncertainty in a probabilistic model will be explored.
    Opportuneness will be considered.

    stiffness coefficient (K) of a system. It defines robustness as the greatest horizon
    of uncertainty (h) up to which the system model obeys a performance requirement.
  115: Info-Gap Decision Theory (IG) is used to assess the robustness of a system
    to uncertainty. Robustness is defined as the greatest horizon of uncertainty up
    to which a performance requirement is met. The results are applicable when there
    is significant uncertainty about key parameters, and a decision-maker wants to
    ensure acceptable performance even under unfavorable conditions.
  118: "The analysis uses an info-gap model (Eq. 5.3) to assess the robustness and\
    \ opportuneness of decisions under uncertainty. It examines how changes in estimated\
    \ stiffness (\u02DCK) and the error in its estimation (s) affect these two measures.\
    \ The analysis is applicable when there is uncertainty in a system's stiffness,\
    \ which is relevant when modeling the response of a system to external shocks,\
    \ such as those induced by climate change."

    under uncertainty. Robustness functions are evaluated to determine the level of
    uncertainty that can be tolerated while still meeting performance requirements.
  122: The analysis uses an info-gap robustness approach to assess the sensitivity
    of a system to uncertainty in the pdfs of a performance metric. The robustness
    function is derived mathematically and illustrated graphically. The approach is
    applicable when there is significant uncertainty in the probability distributions
    of relevant variables.
  123: The method provides a way to prioritize alternatives based on robustness in
    achieving critical outcomes rather than relying on zero-robustness predictions.
  126: Engineering Options Analysis (EOA) is presented as an approach to quantitative
    analysis for planning, design, and management of engineering systems over time
    in the context of uncertainty. It calculates the value of options (e.g., flexibility
    in the timing, size, and location of changes in the engineering system) in terms
    of the distribution of additional benefits due to the options. EOA handles multiple
    options simultaneously and allows for all sorts of measures of benefits and values.

    ranges over which one approach is preferable to another; EOA is a process of monitoring
    developments and readjusting.
  136: The paper contrasts Engineering Options Analysis (EOA) with Real Options Analysis
    (ROA). EOA focuses on helping decision-makers understand alternative plans and
    choose the one that best meets their needs, balancing average expectations with
    downside risks.
  146: The RDM process includes decision framing (defining key elements), evaluating
    strategies in many futures, vulnerability analysis (identifying conditions causing
    unacceptable performance), and exploring trade-offs among robust strategies.
  148: The paper discusses the use of Robust Decision Making (RDM) to assess adaptive
    approaches, explore alternative adaptive strategies based on signposts and triggers,
    and model how decisionmakers update their beliefs about future conditions and
    adjust decisions.

    The CRSS model simulates Basin outcomes across thousands of futures, with a time-step
    from 2012 to 2060.
  153: Robust Decision Making (RDM) is applied. A robust strategy minimizes regret
    across plausible future conditions. Regret is defined as the additional amount
    of total annual supply (volume of water, in maf) that would be needed to maintain
    the Lake Mead level at 1000 feet across the simulation.
  154: The analysis compares the performance of different water management strategies
    (static and adaptive) under various future streamflow conditions. The performance
    is evaluated based on the 'Percent of Futures In Which Objectives Not Met', 'Annual
    Cost', and 'Percent Futures Low Regret'.
  156: The paper uses a decision-making framework to revise beliefs over time in response
    to declining streamflows and develop robust adaptive strategies. It uses thresholds
    to suggest rules of thumb for interpreting information and implementing robust
    adaptive strategies. Basin-wide robust adaptive strategy guides the investment
    of additional water supply yield or demand reductions.
  159: "Robust Decision Making (RDM) is suggested as an alternative to standard probabilistic\
    \ planning methods due to deep uncertainty. The case study summarizes a study\
    \ by Molina-Perez (2016), the \uFB01rst comprehensive demonstration of how RDM\
    \ methods could be used to inform global climate technology policymaking."

    (analysis of variance based on a three-level, full-factorial design of computer
    experiments) to identify influential parameters, and finite element simulations.
  223: 'Info-Gap Robust Design: The robustness function is obtained by considering
    greater and greater levels of horizon-of-uncertainty. For any performance limit
    on the horizontal axis (Critical Stress), the corresponding point on the vertical
    axis is the greatest tolerable uncertainty (Robustness).'

    for timing and location flexibility in design strategy, examining modular and
    flexible strategies.

    strategies. The analysis uses Monte Carlo simulation and considers extreme values
    (Value at Risk, Value at Gain) at specific thresholds (10% and 90% percentiles).
    Learning is also considered as a parameter that reduces module costs as more get
    implemented.
  241: Analysis explores the joint effect of economies of scale and learning rates
    on the desirability of possible design strategies for national adaptation.
  242: Uses Exploratory Options Analysis (EOA), which generates a range of metrics
    for comparison of alternative strategies. This allows for multi-criteria decision
    making and consideration of several perspectives simultaneously, unlike economic
    options analysis or optimization processes that rely on a single price/value or
    objective function.

    of service throughout the planning horizon.
  250: A Physical Performance Module models the performance of a physical system under
    different scenarios and identifies when performance thresholds are exceeded. An

    Climate-Informed Risks.
  266: 'The process begins with gathering information on the decision at hand in a
    structured fashion, using four categories: Choices, Uncertainties, Consequences,
    and Connections.'
  267: The paper describes a decision-making framework (PROW or XLRM) for evaluating
    choices in the face of climate change uncertainties. It emphasizes defining choices,
    uncertainties, quantifiable consequences (performance measures), and the connections
    between them, often represented by models or functions.
  269: The paper discusses a climate stress testing algorithm designed to create a
    wider range of climate changes than typical downscaled multi-model ensembles.
    It uses a systematic approach that can be more computationally efficient for complex
    systems. The stress test provides a response function that relates changes in
    decision-relevant outcomes to changes in the climate and socio-economic system.
    This allows for parsing future conditions into regions of acceptable and unacceptable
    performance, a process termed Scenario Discovery (SD).
  270: Weather generators create scenarios independent of climate projections, allowing
    exploration of future climates while maintaining spatial and temporal climate
    attributes.
  272: The methodology characterizes risk as the probability of occurrence of problematic
    conditions identified through the climate response surface, after avoiding the
    use of probabilities for particular scenarios during the exploration of decision
    options.
  274: Climate risk screening to compare alternative plans or evaluate the additional
    robustness that a specific planned adaptation might provide; analysis determines
    which adaptations can preserve outcomes above their thresholds across the range
    of future scenarios.
  278: A climate stress test is performed using a daily stochastic weather generator
    that creates new sequences of climate. These weather sequences are passed through
    a series of hydrosystem models of the relevant river basins and infrastructure
    network to estimate how these changes in climate will translate into altered water
    availability.
  286: The analysis uses bivariate probability density functions (pdfs) of annual
    temperature and precipitation change, with and without intra-family correlations,
    superimposed on a climate response surface. A climate robustness metric is used
    to numerically integrate the pdf mass in the region of unacceptable performance.

    establishment of a permanent Delta Commissioner to ensure implementation independent
    of political interference.
  337: Ex-ante evaluation of Adaptive Delta Management (ADM) principles with a focus
    on juridical, administrative, and financial aspects; Application of ADM approach
    to themes and regions.

    Network to assess both implementation progress and external developments, informing
    necessary adjustments to strategies and plans.
  349: "Structured decision-making process involving monitoring, analyzing, and acting\
    \ (MAA). The flowchart depicts a systematic approach to managing complex issues\
    \ in delta planning through research, innovation, societal input, and ongoing\
    \ evaluation at both strategic and operational levels. Politicization to mobilize\
    \ political interest, followed by depoliticization to program measures at arm\u2019\
    s length."
  365: 'The paper describes two strategies for investigating the influence of uncertainties
    and policy levers on outcomes: ''exploration'' and ''search''. Exploration involves
    systematically sampling the uncertainty and policy lever spaces to evaluate consequences,
    using techniques like Monte Carlo sampling or factorial methods. Search strategies
    hunt through these spaces in a more directed manner to find points with particular
    properties.'
  372: Presents a taxonomy of components for supporting decision-making under deep
    uncertainty, including policy architecture, scenario generation, alternative generation,
    robustness definition, and vulnerability analysis. Advocates for choosing appropriate
    combinations of tools based on the problem situation rather than arguing over
    specific approaches like RDM or DAPP.
  377: DMDU (Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty) approaches are presented as a
    technology of complexity for policy analysis, especially in public policy, and
    are applicable when prior rules of thumb are no longer believed to hold true.

    of observation and orientation to trigger decision and action in the context of
    public policy and adaptation.
  391: Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) analysis is highlighted as a
    framework for addressing complicated policy issues, evaluating alternative assumptions,
    and evolving potential courses of action iteratively.
  396: The paper introduces Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) approaches
    as an alternative to traditional policy analysis. DMDU focuses on identifying
    vulnerabilities in proposed policies and assessing options to reduce these vulnerabilities,
    instead of making assumptions and predicting outcomes to choose a policy. DMDU
    approaches utilize exploratory modeling combined with adaptive policies to improve
    policy adaptivity and robustness.
  397: 'The page discusses different decision-making under deep uncertainty (DMDU)
    approaches: Info-Gap (IG), Robust Decision Making (RDM), Dynamic Adaptive Policy
    (DAP), Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP), and Exploratory Options Analysis
    (EOA). These approaches aim to enhance the robustness of a plan by preventing
    failure or enhancing adaptability through a decision-making process that adjusts
    the plan to fit new conditions in a timely manner. IG builds an uncertainty model
    to evaluate alternatives. RDM characterizes uncertainties to highlight trade-offs.
    DAP distinguishes different types of actions to prevent an initial policy from
    failing. DAPP adds sequencing of changes to the initial policy. EOA explores diverse
    alternative system designs with varying degrees of flexibility. The general DMDU
    approach emphasizes creating a shared strategic vision, exploring adaptive strategies,
    committing to short-term actions, keeping long-term options open, and preparing
    a framework with monitoring systems, triggers, and contingency actions.'
  404: Analytic model derived from a theoretical statement of relationships; used
    to project how a policy will perform in a given future, evaluated according to
    specified outcome indicators.
More Notes:
  17: The financial crisis of 2008-2009 is presented as an example of the importance
    of acknowledging and confronting deep uncertainty.
  28: The tools can generate quantitative evidence and insights supporting decision-making
    about different possible courses of action.
  35: "RDM embeds analytic tools in a decision support process called \u201Cdeliberation\
    \ with analysis\u201D that promotes learning and consensus-building among stakeholders."
  37: RDM involves running models many times to stress test decisions against a wide
    range of plausible futures and using visualization and statistical analysis to
    help decision-makers identify key features that distinguish futures where plans
    succeed or fail.
  38: "RDM originated in debates within the RAND Corporation about how best to use\
    \ models that could not be validated in the same way as models of less complex\
    \ decision spaces, or for which probability distribution functions could not be\
    \ applied with con\uFB01dence."
  40: The text describes RDM's use of scenario analysis and Assumption-Based Planning
    as means of exploring and communicating deep uncertainty about the future, by
    organizing information into distinct cases (scenarios) based on key uncertain
    determinants.
  43: The approach uses an 'XLRM' matrix for exogenous uncertainties, policy levers,
    relationships, and measures of performance.
  45: RDM is consistent with other decision-making under deep uncertainty (DMDU) literature,
    such as Multi-Objective RDM (MORDM) and the DAPP process. It emphasizes an iterative
    process of problem framing, scenario generation, alternative identification, and
    tradeoff analysis.
  47: RDM focuses on tradeoffs rather than normative rankings of strategies, aiming
    for less sensitivity to assumptions. It uses expected regret as an argument in
    a domain criterion. The Combined Strategy discussed in Sect. 2.5.3 is highlighted
    as robust.
  49: The example RDM study addresses the question of whether and under what conditions
    technology incentives prove necessary and important as part of a greenhouse gas
    reduction strategy.
  50: The study uses an exploratory model to compare price- and subsidy-based strategies.
  52: 'The carbon tax is designed to adjust based on political constraints: it can''t
    rise faster than the observed social cost of carbon and is dropped back to its
    original level during recessions; The technology subsidy is terminated if it either
    succeeds in launching the technology or fails to reach a minimum market share
    after a certain number of years.'
  53: The study addresses the best mix of policy instruments for decarbonization at
    a national or state/provincial level. The study envisions policymakers choosing
    a strategy which includes the rules by which the initial actions will be adapted
    over time.
  54: "The study did not examine pre-commitment issues\u2014that is, how the current\
    \ legislature could ensure that future legislatures would in fact follow the adaptive\
    \ strategy."
  72: The analysis distinguishes between certain and uncertain vulnerabilities and
    opportunities, suggesting different response strategies for each.
  73: The text discusses strategies for adapting airport infrastructure and operations
    in response to changes in aviation demand, competition, and environmental factors
  74: The page discusses vulnerabilities and opportunities related to airport capacity,
    noise pollution, and environmental impact, but doesn't explicitly link these to
    broader macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  76: The analysis appears to be focused on a specific industry (aviation) and airport
    (Schiphol), making it difficult to generalize to nation-wide macroeconomic or
    macro-fiscal outcomes. The actions are specific to the airport's operations and
    do not directly translate into national-level fiscal measures.
  77: Actions are categorized as Defensive (DA), Corrective (CR), Reassessment (RE),
    and Capitalizing (CP)
  82: "DAPP aims to be less scenario-dependent and focuses on identifying conditions\
    \ under which a policy will fail (Adaptation Tipping Points). DAPP approach has\
    \ been adopted by, and further co-developed with, the Dutch Delta Programme, which\
    \ aims to maximize flexibility, keeping options open and avoiding \u2018lock-in\u2019\
    \ in the face of future uncertainties in climate, population, economy and society."
  87: The page describes a framework (DAPP) for planning adaptation strategies under
    uncertainty. The pathways map and scorecard are tools for decision-making in a
    changing environment. The approach emphasizes adaptive responses to changing conditions
    and recognizes that some sequences of actions may be impossible, undesirable,
    or less likely.
  91: The example focuses on navigation (low-flow management) in the Netherlands.
  93: The analysis considers adaptation tipping points (ATPs) and the timing of actions.
    Flexibility and locked-in situations are considered in pathway selection. The
    selected pathway involves a combination of small-scale dredging in the short term
    and leaving options open to shift to other actions in the future. Monitoring programs
    and environmental protections are crucial for the robustness of the plan.
  97: DAPP is intended to avoid maladaptation or delaying action until it is too late,
    and emphasizes searching for strong signals that indicate an ATP is approaching.
  103: The paper discusses 'innovation dilemmas' involving choices between better
    but more uncertain alternatives. It presents both quantitative and qualitative
    examples of info-gap analysis.
  107: The info-gap model includes insights and contextual understanding about the
    uncertainty.
  113: The presented mechanical system is a highly simplified representation and doesn't
    directly translate to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal models. The discussion of
    uncertainty and robustness might be relevant conceptually, but there is a considerable
    gap in scale and context. This excerpt focuses on engineering design and not macroeconomic
    impacts.
  115: The paper uses a simplified system model to illustrate the concepts of robustness,
    trade-off, and zeroing in IG decision theory. The specific example involves displacement
    (x), stiffness (K), and a force (F), which serves as an analogy for performance,
    system characteristics, and external drivers, respectively. The robustness function
    Eq. (5.5) and its graphical representation in Fig. 5.3 are central to the analysis.
  118: The concept of an 'innovation dilemma' is introduced, where decision-makers
    must choose between a putatively better but more uncertain option and a less uncertain
    option. This dilemma likely relates to adaptation choices where innovative solutions
    may have higher potential benefits but also greater uncertainty compared to more
    established approaches.
  119: The analysis illustrates a dilemma where an innovative option is preferred
    based on estimated parameters but has higher uncertainty. The robustness curves
    show how the relative advantage of the innovative option diminishes as uncertainty
    increases.
  122: "The paper is about robustness analysis under uncertainty using info-gap theory,\
    \ applied to some unspecified system/model. The context (macroeconomic/fiscal\
    \ risks of climate change) is not apparent from this page alone. The parameters\
    \ F, x_c, \u03BC, and \u03C3 are not defined on this page, but appear related\
    \ to defining the Pf(\u02DCp). 'K' is the system performance variable whose PDF\
    \ is being analyzed."
  123: The analysis highlights challenges in bridging qualitative and quantitative
    analysis and the complexity of evaluating robustness in large systems due to computational
    difficulties.
  126: EOA is contrasted with Real Options Analysis (ROA), highlighting that ROA assumes
    more accurate estimation of future uncertainties, focuses on analyzing a single
    option at a time, and aims to develop single monetary values for options. EOA
    deals with deeper uncertainties and a broader range of benefits and values.
  133: EOA explores the context widely, compares the range of possibilities, and proposes
    strategies, and thus opening decisions, that are most likely to be successful.
  136: The paper criticizes ROA for requiring detailed statistical data and for its
    inability to deal with path-dependent situations and multiple options simultaneously.
  148: The case study focuses on long-term water resources planning for the Colorado
    River Basin, highlighting the importance of water resources for various sectors,
    including agriculture, municipal needs, and power generation.
  150: The analysis focuses on vulnerabilities in the Colorado River Basin related
    to water supply, using water management portfolios as policy levers. The study
    does not directly assess macroeconomic or fiscal impacts.
  153: The analysis explores across a range of different investment signposts and
    triggers, specified to be more or less aggressive, to represent different stakeholder
    preferences for cost and reliability.
  154: The 'triggers' mentioned in the description of Figure 7.6 likely refer to the
    conditions that activate the different components of the adaptive strategies.
    The term 'low regret' is not explicitly defined, but it likely refers to strategies
    that perform reasonably well across a range of potential future conditions. 'Current
    Management' and 'Implement-All-Actions' are two static management strategies for
    water resources. The x-axis of Figure 7.7 has values < 11 maf, < 12 maf, < 13
    maf, < 14 maf, < 15 maf, < 16 maf, < 17 maf, and >17 maf, where maf presumably
    stands for million acre-feet, a standard unit for expressing volumes of water.
  156: The paper focuses on water supply management in a specific basin (likely the
    Colorado River Basin, although not explicitly stated on this page) and develops
    adaptive strategies in response to declining streamflows. The vulnerabilities
    are ordered from less severe to more severe. The results highlight the amount
    of additional water supply or demand reduction needed to meet the Basin's goals
    in each decade. The approach involves revising decision-maker beliefs and implementing
    a robust adaptive strategy.
  159: The page focuses on climate mitigation technology diffusion policies. The Green
    Climate Fund (GCF) is identified as a key coordinator of global investments in
    this area. SETs (sustainable energy technologies) are defined. Paris Climate Accord
    objectives are mentioned as maintaining temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius
    and stabilising greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the century.
  160: The analysis uses a simplified XLRM (Exogenous factors, Policy levers, Relationships,
    Measures of performance) chart for decision framing of climate technology policy
    analyses.
  161: The EDIAM framework depends on three main mechanisms related to R&D investment
    and technological evolution in advanced and emerging regions.
  165: The analysis identifies combinations of uncertainties that signal a move from
    one policy option to another.
  173: Focus is on the practical application and evaluation of DAP in the context
    of traffic safety technology implementation
  179: This page focuses on the methodology for setting up a Decision-Analytic Protocol
    (DAP) workshop for ISA (likely Implementation Strategy Assessment), not on the
    outcomes of climate change or adaptation. It describes a process for policymakers
    to develop adaptive plans using a structured workshop and SWOT-TOWS analysis.
  194: The study focuses on flood risk management at a regional level in New Zealand.
  200: The analysis incorporates adaptation thresholds, indicating when a shift to
    a new policy option is required based on climate change impacts.
  201: The pathways were initially developed manually and then redrawn using a pathways
    generator from Deltares.
  206: This page provides biographical information about the authors of the chapter,
    and mentions the application of Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) and Real
    Options Analysis to flood and coastal management in New Zealand. However, it does
    not contain specific quantitative results or detailed methodological descriptions
    relevant to the requested macroeconomic or macro-fiscal analysis.
  209: 'The paper uses climate change policy decisions as an example of how info-gap
    robustness can be applied, particularly when scientific understanding is incomplete.
    It discusses two approaches: the precautionary principle and scientific design
    of intervention. Given scientific uncertainty, policymakers are inclined to adopt
    early precautionary intervention.'
  217: The aim is to design a mechanical latch robust to uncertainty in its geometry.
    Computational efficiency is a key consideration, leading to a focus on parameters
    that significantly influence performance.
  223: The analysis appears to be for a mechanical latch design, where 'critical stress'
    represents a performance limit. The results may not be directly transferable to
    macroeconomic or fiscal analysis without significant adaptation of the methodology
    and interpretation of the variables.
  233: The paper uses a uniform distribution for demand projections for simplicity,
    not as a recommended approach. It's acknowledged that the characterization of
    uncertainty remains imperfect.
  236: The study focuses on LNG plant design and investment decisions, illustrating
    the impact of uncertainty on project valuation and optimal capacity planning.
    The analysis considers non-linearities in both cost structure and demand variations.
  238: The fixed design is larger and takes advantage of economies of scale, but is
    vulnerable to demand uncertainty. The flexible design starts with a smaller module
    (25 tons/day) and can expand capacity as needed.
  241: The analysis uses a 'flexible strategy' approach where timing is considered
    in conjunction with different learning rates, analyzing economies of scale impacts
    on the flexibility value.
  242: The analysis emphasizes the importance of flexible and modular strategies when
    faced with deep uncertainty. The best values of each metric are highlighted in
    bold in Table 11.3 to aid decision-makers in comparing projects.
  243: The EOA emphasizes monitoring, incremental learning, and adaptive management
    as crucial components of flexible design policies in the face of future uncertainties.
  247: The analysis is for a specific location (IJmuiden pumping station) and considers
    physical correlation between scenarios to avoid unrealistic combinations. Design
    alternatives are evaluated based on initial structural design and how further
    capacity is added over time. The protection level of the IJmuiden structure should
    provide protection against North Sea levels exceeded on average once every 10,000
    years, according to Dutch federal law (Netherlands Flood Defense Act 2009).
  250: The model is iterative, with the system model output potentially feeding back
    into the process to refine data and inputs; The discount rate used is consistent
    with Rijkswaterstaat's practices for capital investment projects.
  251: The analysis focuses on the inland water level regulation function of the IJmuiden
    Pumping Station.
  252: The EOA analysis provides distributions of outcomes, offering more insights
    than standard Real Options Analysis, which produces a singular measure of performance.
  253: The analysis focuses on the trade-offs between upfront investment and future
    risk mitigation in the context of climate change adaptation, specifically regarding
    water regulation and flood defense.
  254: The analysis focuses on the IJmuiden pumping station in the Netherlands.
  255: EOA doesn't prescribe a single plan but focuses on starting a path leading
    to desirable developments while avoiding threatening downside risks, similar to
    a chess master's strategic approach.
  263: The paper describes DS, a method used for incorporating climate change information
    into decision-making processes.
  269: The approach emphasizes representing natural variability, as it can be dominant
    at the temporal and spatial scales relevant to adaptation decision-making and
    risk assessment. The detailed representation of temporal and spatial variability
    is required to accurately assess some systems (e.g., water supply systems).
  278: The analysis focuses on the water supply security of Colorado State University
    (CSU) as a case study and links it to the broader water supply risks facing the
    entire Colorado River Basin.
  286: The unacceptable system performance is defined as conditions under which the
    CSU cannot provide reliable indoor drinking water. The paper emphasizes the importance
    of even small probabilities of water shortfalls due to the potentially intolerable
    impact on the local community.
  327: The Delta Act provides the legislative foundation for the Delta Programme.
  333: The focus is on stabilizing and depoliticizing climate adaptation processes
    by setting up permanent roles, budgets, and legal structures.
  337: The Ministerial Working Group urged that further development of the approach
    should not make it more complex.
  338: This page primarily discusses the Adaptive Delta Management (ADM) approach
    implemented in the Dutch Delta Programme. It focuses on the process, evaluation,
    and stakeholder engagement rather than providing quantitative economic or fiscal
    outcomes related to climate change adaptation at a national level. The page does
    not contain macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risk assessments.
  345: The paper highlights organizational characteristics like timing, composition,
    and coupling in evaluation processes.
  347: The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system (MMA) focuses on whether programmed
    measures have been executed in time and facilitates multi-level programming.
  349: "The programme includes mechanisms for adjusting goals, instruments, actions,\
    \ strategies, long-term options, measures, and realization rates based on monitoring\
    \ and analysis. Attempts to dismantle the structure due to political motivations\
    \ failed because of the programme\u2019s legislative foundation."
  350: This excerpt focuses on the process of adaptation planning and implementation,
    particularly regarding flood safety in the Netherlands (likely the Delta Programme).
    It discusses the Adaptive Delta Management (ADM) approach and adaptation pathways.
    While it touches on the necessity of adaptation and its political challenges,
    it doesn't directly provide quantitative macroeconomic or macro-fiscal information,
    nor does it focus on specific economic outcomes.
  355: This page primarily provides author information and copyright details, with
    limited direct relevance to the core analytical aspects of a macroeconomic review
    of climate change and adaptation. The content suggests a focus on adaptive delta
    management in the Netherlands, which could involve some macro-fiscal implications,
    but these are not explicitly detailed on this page.
  377: For problems suited to DMDU, an initial fast and simple exploratory model can
    elucidate major interactions between policy choices and the problem system, with
    factors appearing most salient then examined in more detail.
  384: The decision-making process often lacks the iterative nature proposed by the
    OODA loop, with a tendency toward static solutions rather than dynamic, ongoing
    adaptation processes.
  385: The paper discusses the need for adaptive approaches to policy formulation,
    engagement, and inclusion, and explicitly addressing uncertainties. It also highlights
    the intertwined relationship between policy analysis and policy approaches, suggesting
    that new approaches to policy analysis may enable different approaches to policy.
  391: The text emphasizes the importance of integrating policy and analysis, and
    using analytical tools to navigate policy adaptations and maintain policy effectiveness
    across future fluctuations.
  396: The book also examines the design of institutions and processes to facilitate
    decision-making under deep uncertainty, including procedures and legislation to
    enable policies to respond to events, data collection, and repeated review of
    goals. Part IV synthesizes the material and proposes a framing of the DMDU field
    and a trajectory for its application.
  404: The document provides a glossary of terms commonly used in DMDU studies. The
    terminology used refers to both aspects of the analysis and attributes of the
    real world.

    versions of the future evaluated via Monte Carlo simulation for each scenario;
    Results for a range of discount rates generated for sensitivity analysis.
  251: Relative lifetime economic performance of three structural designs under different
    sea level/precipitation scenarios and discount rates (0% and 5.5%). Proactive
    Flexible design leads to higher costs than Reactive Adaptive in about 15% of simulations,
    but still costs less about 25% of the time in the less risky scenario.
