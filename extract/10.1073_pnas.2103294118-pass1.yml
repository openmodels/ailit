Drivers of Risk:
  1: Enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations and their impact on daily temperature
    variability, climate change.
  4: Increasing greenhouse forcing impacting daily temperature variability.
  7: Day-to-day temperature variability
Highlights:
  1: Daily temperature variability changes with distinct global patterns as greenhouse
    gas concentrations rise, increasing at low to mid latitudes and decreasing at
    northern mid to high latitudes. These changes are attributable to enhanced greenhouse
    forcing. Mitigation of greenhouse gases can limit these changes.
  4: Historical changes in daily temperature variability can be attributed to increasing
    greenhouse forcing with a high degree of spatial similarity between observed and
    forced responses, particularly in annual and winter (DJF) responses. Similarity
    is lower in summer (JJA) due to inter-model disagreement at northern mid to high
    latitudes. Assessments of similarity are significant when compared to natural
    internal climate variability.
  7: Day-to-day temperature variability reduces economic growth.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of reanalyses of historical observations and a multi-model ensemble
    from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. The results are applicable
    to the end of the century under different emissions scenarios.
  4: The study uses Low-Frequency Component Analysis (LFCA) to identify patterns of
    change in daily temperature variability from both historical data (NOAA 20th Century
    Reanalysis) and climate model simulations (CMIP-6 ensemble). Pattern correlation
    statistics (centered and uncentered) are used to assess the similarity between
    observed and simulated patterns of change, accounting for internal climate variability
    estimated from pre-industrial control runs.
  7: Uses least-squares, linear regression models to assess the covariance of the
    simulated per-decadal warming and variability changes across CMIP-6 models and
    forcing scenarios.
More Notes:
  1: The global response of daily temperature variability to enhanced greenhouse forcing
    is likely to have strong and unequal effects on societies, economies, and ecosystems
    if mitigation and protection measures are not taken.
  4: The study focuses on attributing observed changes in daily temperature variability
    to greenhouse forcing, rather than directly quantifying macroeconomic or fiscal
    impacts. The relevance to a macro-fiscal review lies in providing evidence for
    the impact of climate change on a key climate variable (temperature variability)
    which may have knock-on effects on economic sectors.
  7: This page focuses on the impact of daily temperature variability on economic
    growth, and utilizes CMIP-6 climate model data to assess these changes.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: The paper identifies daily temperature variability as an important determinant
    of societal outcomes, including economic growth.
  4: No relevant information
  7: Economic growth
Quantitative material:
  1: Daily temperature variability is projected to increase by up to 100% at low latitudes
    and decrease by 40% at northern high latitudes by the end of the century under
    a business-as-usual emissions scenario.
  4: No relevant information
  7: Day-to-day temperature variability reduces economic growth (Kotz et al. 2021)
