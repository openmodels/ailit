Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in intramonthly variability of daily surface temperature due to rising
    greenhouse gas concentrations.
  2: Changes in daily temperature variability (intramonthly SD of daily surface temperature)
  3: "Daily temperature variability under historical (1950\u20132015) and future (2015\u2013\
    2100) greenhouse forcing specified by the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP)-585,\
    \ a business-as-usual emissions scenario under which greenhouse forcing continues\
    \ to increase monotonically."
  4: Changes in daily temperature variability due to increasing greenhouse forcing
  5: The analysis identifies increasing temperature variability in the tropics, Southern
    Hemisphere, and European summer, and decreasing variability at northern mid to
    high latitudes due to Arctic amplification.
  6: Changes in daily temperature variability, anthropogenic greenhouse forcing, volcanic/solar/aerosol
    forcing components.

  3: No relevant information
  4: No relevant information
  5: The page evaluates the similarity and scaling of historical global patterns of
    change in daily temperature variability with those expected due to anthropogenic
    greenhouse forcing.
  6: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: Identifies distinct global patterns in intramonthly variability of daily surface
    temperature changes with rising greenhouse gas concentrations. Shows that changes
    in daily temperature variability are attributable to enhanced greenhouse forcing.
    Demonstrates that mitigation of greenhouse gases can limit changes in daily temperature
    variability. Global changes in daily variability exhibit strong covariation with
    warming across climate models, suggesting that equilibrium climate sensitivity
    plays a role.
  2: Latitudinal polarization in daily temperature variability in annual and DJF cases,
    with reductions at northern mid to high latitudes opposed by increases across
    the majority of the continental land mass elsewhere. For JJA, reductions across
    North America, the high Arctic, and parts of North Africa opposed by strong increases
    elsewhere. Increases across the tropics, Australia, Europe, and large parts of
    South America and Africa in boreal summer.
  3: Identifies monotonically increasing patterns of change in daily temperature variability
    from internal, multidecadal climate variability. Shows strong latitudinal dependence
    in both the annual and DJF cases.
  4: High spatial similarity between historical and forced responses noted for annual
    and DJF variability; less similarity for JJA
  5: Historically observed variability changes are larger than those of the CMIP-6
    ensemble for a given historical warming level, suggesting models underpredict
    changes in daily variability.
  6: Historically observed global changes in daily temperature variability are very
    unlikely to have occurred due to natural internal climate variability and are
    highly consistent with the expected response to anthropogenic greenhouse forcing.
    Future changes in daily temperature variability are likely to have strong impacts
    on human and ecological systems, exacerbating regional inequalities and climate
    injustices.
  7: Distinct approach from optimal fingerprinting by avoiding reliance on climate
    model accuracy assumptions.
Methodology:
  1: "Uses reanalyses of historical observations and state-of-the-art climate projections\
    \ from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Applies a signal-to-noise-maximizing\
    \ pattern-\uFB01ltering technique to isolate changes attributable to enhanced\
    \ greenhouse forcing."
  2: Uses low-frequency component analysis (LFCA), an extension of principal component
    analysis (PCA), to identify spatial patterns with coherent low-frequency temporal
    evolution in historical reanalyses of daily temperature variability. The NOAA
    20th Century Reanalysis is used as the main specification. CMIP-6 climate models
    are used to project future changes.
  3: Uses a multimodel ensemble of 10 bias-corrected Coupled Global Circulation Models
    (CGCMs) from CMIP-6. Applies Lowest-Frequency Component Analysis (LFCA) to calculate
    daily temperature variability from individual ensemble members under historical
    and future forcing, covering the period 1950 to 2100. LFCA is used to identify
    externally forced signals.
  4: Pattern-correlation statistics used for evaluating similarity of observed and
    expected temperature variability changes
  5: Patterns of change are analyzed using CMIP-6 models and NOAA 20th Century Reanalysis
    to assess linear covariation between daily variability and mean temperature changes.
  6: Uses a multimodel ensemble of CMIP-6 climate models, LFCA (a form of linear discriminant
    analysis), and pattern-correlation statistics.  Daily temperature variability
    is measured as the SD of daily surface temperature within a given month of a given
    year. The assessment rests on the assumption that climate models accurately represent
    the internal variability of the real-world climate system.
  7: The significance of correlations is assessed relative to natural internal climate
    variability using CMIP-6 control runs.
More Notes:
  1: Focuses on high-frequency (daily) temperature variability.
  2: Detection of historical increases in daily temperature variability in European
    summer and across the tropics and wider Southern Hemisphere confirms the predictions
    of previous generations of climate models.
  3: "Figure 2 shows the lowest-frequency patterns of change in daily temperature\
    \ variability from individual CMIP-6 climate models under greenhouse forcing (1950\u2013\
    2015: historical; 2015\u20132100: SSP-585), detected with LFCA, for annual, DJF\
    \ and JJA responses."
  4: Most model discrepancies concentrated at latitudinal boundary and in North Africa
  6: The biggest increases in daily temperature variability are observed in and projected
    for low-latitude regions with typically low income and low historical emissions
    of greenhouse gases.
Quantitative material:
  1: Daily temperature variability increases up to 100% at low latitudes and decreases
    by 40% at northern high latitudes by the end of the century under a business-as-usual
    emissions scenario.
  2: Increases and decreases of up to 40% and 20% in daily temperature variability
    over the past 65 years, with particularly strong percentage increases across the
    tropics
  3: "Interdecadal changes (1950\u20131960 to 2090\u20132100) due to the lowest-frequency\
    \ component are shown as colored maps, the time evolution of which are shown in\
    \ the bottom panels in gray, with a 10-y running mean in black."
  4: Patterns of annual, DJF, and JJA temperature trends correlated from NOAA 20th
    Century Reanalysis and CMIP6 models
  5: Strong linear covariation between daily temperature variability and mean temperature
    changes is noted across CMIP-6 models and scenarios, and the similarity is significant
    at least at the 1% level in certain cases.
  6: Historically observed global changes in daily temperature variability are very
    unlikely to have occurred due to natural internal climate variability. Global
    response of the high-frequency climate system has already caused changes in daily
    temperature variability of up to 40%, which are projected to change by a further
    100% by the end of the century under a business-as-usual emissions scenario.
