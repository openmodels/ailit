Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increases in relative humidity, decreases in vertical wind shear, amplified warming
    in the upper troposphere, and changes in heating patterns near coastlines
  2: Increased frequency and severity of TC rapid intensification due to climate warming.
  3: "Projected changes in vertical wind shear (VWS) in nearshore regions of the Northern\
    \ Hemisphere due to changes in surface pressure, three-dimensional temperature,\
    \ and winds from the zonally symmetric climate during the near-future period of\
    \ 2015\u20132034 and the late 21st century (2081-2100)."
  5: The increase in nearshore TC intensification is linked to changes in sea surface
    temperature (SST), vertical wind shear (VWS), and relative humidity (RH) in various
    ocean regions.
  6: Changes in nearshore vertical wind shear (VWS) and relative humidity (RH) have
    made environments more favorable for storm development.
  7: The paper identifies changes in Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Vertical Wind
    Shear, and Relative Humidity as potential drivers of TC intensification.
  8: Changes in nearshore tropical cyclone (TC) intensification rates due to future
    climate scenarios (SSP585).
  10: Changes in diabatic heating and basic atmospheric states are dominant in shaping
    the spatial pattern of shear response over the Northern Hemisphere. Anomalous
    transient forcing has a smaller contribution.
  11: Anomalous heating forced by anthropogenic warming. Meridional dipole-like response
    of vertical wind shear (VWS) over the Central and North American region is mainly
    excited by enhanced heating over the tropical eastern Pacific, with a secondary
    contribution from anomalous diabatic cooling over the tropical North Atlantic.
    Climate change-induced anomalous heating has contrasting effects on the VWS in
    various regions of Asia. Formation of a heat-induced stationary baroclinic Rossby
    wave over the Asian continent and the western North Pacific. Anomalous cyclone
    centered near the Tibetan Plateau. Anomalous anticyclones above Hawaii and the
    tropical-subtropical North Atlantic. Decreased convective mass fluxes in the tropics.
    Heightened static stability of the tropical-subtropical troposphere.
  12: Enhanced nearshore intensification rate of TCs under global warming potentially
    due to decreased vertical wind shear (VWS) near coastal areas.
  14: Mentions tropical cyclones, landfalling hurricanes, evaporation changes, tropospheric
    warming, stratospheric cooling, soil moisture anomalies, sea surface temperature,
    and scenarios for CMIP6. These are mentioned as relevant phenomena, not necessarily
    linked causally to risk drivers in these citations
Evaluation overview:
  1: Coastal damages from tropical cyclones (TCs)
  3: No relevant information
  5: The paper evaluates changes in nearshore and offshore tropical cyclone (TC) intensification
    rates over major coastlines globally from 1979 to 2020.
  7: The paper evaluates the intensification rate of nearshore Tropical Cyclones (TCs).
  8: No relevant information
  10: No relevant information
  11: No relevant information
  12: The paper suggests potential strengthening of landfalling tropical cyclones
    (TCs) increasing their destructive capacity, impacting economic losses, fatalities,
    and property damages in the U.S. coastal areas by the late 21st century.
  14: This page primarily consists of a reference list, so it doesn't directly provide
    an overview of an outcome being evaluated.
Highlights:
  1: Observed increase in nearshore TC intensification rates from 1979-2020; Climate
    models project continued increase in nearshore TC intensification rates
  3: "Investigates the individual contributions of the anomalous basic state, diabatic\
    \ heating, and transient forcing to the projected response in VWS through a series\
    \ of sensitivity runs: CTRL+\u0394BS, CTRL+\u0394DH, and CTRL+\u0394TranF."
  5: There is a significant increase in nearshore TC intensification over the last
    20 years compared to earlier periods, not observed in offshore regions. The U.S.
    East and Gulf coasts, Southeast African and Australian coasts showed the most
    significant increases.
  6: The nearshore environment has become more favorable for storm development compared
    to offshore areas due to significant changes in VWS and RH, primarily near the
    US and Australian coasts.
  7: "There has been a significant rise in the average intensification rate of nearshore\
    \ TCs on a global scale during 1979\u20132020."
  8: TCs will continue to strengthen faster in the nearshore region in the future
    climate. Increases in mean intensification rate occur in all coastal areas except
    near the west coast of Mexico and the Australian coast. The change in the nearshore
    region is greater than in the offshore region.
  10: The SWM is able to reproduce the overall spatial pattern of VWS changes, particularly
    over coastal areas characterized by decreasing VWS. CMIP6 models project a weak
    increase in shear and decreasing 600-hPaRH over the northern parts of the Bay
    of Bengal and the South China Sea, suggesting the nearshore environment will not
    become more favorable for TC intensification over these regions.
  11: Enhanced static stability plays a crucial role in reducing the VWS across Northeast
    Asia and the North Indian Ocean.
  12: Tropical upper-level warming reduces VWS along U.S. coastlines; enhanced warming
    in the Eastern Pacific projected in CMIP6.
  14: References suggest focus on tropical cyclone intensification, translation speed,
    poleward migration, decay of landfalling hurricanes, and changes in destructiveness
    of landfalling cyclones over China. Also references La Nina like responses to
    warming.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of observations, atmospheric reanalyses, and high-resolution climate
    model simulations; Idealized numerical experiments with an intermediate complexity
    model
  2: Used TC track data from IBTrACS and ADT-HURSAT to estimate intensification rates,
    analyzed reanalysis data for environmental parameters, and projected changes using
    climate models.
  3: Uses a time-dependent, primitive equation anomaly model (Stationary Wave Model
    - SWM) with R30 horizontal resolution and 24 vertical sigma layers to conduct
    numerical sensitivity experiments. SWM simulations are run for 100 days, and the
    average from days 31 to 100 is presented. Five independent integrations are performed.
  5: "TC track data is analyzed from IBTrACS over two distinct periods (1979\u2013\
    1999 and 2000\u20132020). Statistically significant changes were tested using\
    \ a Student's t-test for the difference of means."
  6: Analysis uses Sea Surface Temperature data from the UK Met Office's Hadley Center
    and atmospheric data from NCEP-DOE II reanalysis, confirming findings with ERA5
    reanalysis; trends are averaged over June-October for the Northern Hemisphere
    and December-April for the Southern Hemisphere from 1979-2020.
  7: "Trends are based on HadleySST and NCEP\u2010DOEII atmospheric reanalysis. HighResMIP\
    \ simulations are used for a qualitative assessment of the impact of climate change\
    \ on TC intensification. Data is averaged over June-October in the Northern Hemisphere\
    \ and December-April in the Southern Hemisphere."
  8: "Uses TC track data from five fully coupled climate models (HighResMIP) under\
    \ the SSP585 emissions scenario. Data is sub-sampled to ensure statistically similar\
    \ distributions of storm state in the two periods. Analysis focuses on nearshore\
    \ regions (~3\xB0 distance threshold)."
  10: "The analysis uses 15 CMIP6 models and a Stationary Wave Model (SWM) under the\
    \ 'SSP585' emissions scenario to project future changes in vertical wind shear\
    \ (VWS) between the near-future (2015\u20132034) and late 21st century (2081\u2013\
    2100) periods. The effect of individual forcings (diabatic heating, basic state,\
    \ and anomalous transient forcing) on shear response are examined. A Student's\
    \ t-test is used to assess statistical significance."
  11: Sensitivity experiment conducted to investigate the impact of increased warming
    in the upper troposphere on shear changes. The experiment only retains the enhanced
    upper-level warming.
  12: The analysis is based on IBTraCS TC track data, ADT-HURSAT TC track data, Hadley
    SST data, NCEP-DOE II reanalysis, ERA5 reanalysis, and CMIP6 data. SWM simulations
    were also used.
  14: References CMIP5 and CMIP6 climate models, reanalysis datasets (NCEP-DOE AMIP-II),
    and observational datasets (IBTRACS, sea surface temperature data from Rayner
    et al.). The TempestExtremes algorithm is mentioned for tropical storm track calculations.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on nearshore tropical cyclone intensification, an area with
    limited prior research at the global scale.
  3: "Defines 'nearshore' as a distance within approximately 3\xB0 or about 200 nautical\
    \ miles of the coastline. Uses wind speed and translation speed thresholds to\
    \ sub-sample data, ensuring statistical similarity between comparative periods."
  5: Results are robust across different data sources, such as geostationary satellite
    images, and account for regional storm state variations.
  7: HighResMIP models simulate weaker changes in TC intensity compared to best track
    data, so the study uses them only for a qualitative assessment.
  8: The study notes that mean intensification rates in HighResMIP are weaker than
    observations, potentially due to limitations in simulating intense storms.
  10: The discrepancies between the CMIP6 models and the SWM are attributed to the
    coupling and interaction of zonal-mean flows, transient eddies, and diabatic heating
    in the full-physics CMIP6 models, which is prohibited in the SWM. Inaccuracy of
    the dissipation parameterization or other missing physical processes could also
    contribute to disparities in the shear response. Regions where the SWM overestimates
    the shear increase (e.g., central-to-eastern tropical Pacific and northern Eurasia)
    are far away from the coastal areas of the US and Asia, thus not the main focus
    of the study.

    Supporting Information S1 document. The paper discusses circulation responses
    at different levels and their consistency with Gill's model solution.

    need to be gleaned from the full text of each publication.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Global mean TC intensification rate increase of about 3 kt per 24-hr in regions\
    \ close to the coast over the historical period 1979\u20132020"
  3: TC intensification rate is estimated as the linear regression coefficient of
    the storm maximum wind speed over five successive 6-hr track locations.
  5: "Nearshore intensification rates increased from 0.37 kt 6-hr\u207B\xB9 in 1979\u2013\
    1999 to 1.15 kt 6-hr\u207B\xB9 in 2000\u20132020, translating to approximately\
    \ a 3 kt increase in intensity over a 24-hour interval."
  6: "Nearshore VWS has a trend of -0.026 ms\u207B\xB9year\u207B\xB9, offshore VWS\
    \ trend of -0.011 ms\u207B\xB9year\u207B\xB9, and nearshore RH trend of 0.057%\
    \ year\u207B\xB9."
  7: "The figure shows trends in SST (\xB0C year\u207B\xB9), Vertical Wind Shear (m\
    \ s\u207B\xB9 year\u207B\xB9), and Relative Humidity at 600hPa (% year\u207B\xB9\
    ) from 1980 to 2020 for coastal and offshore regions. The shading represents the\
    \ 95% confidence intervals. There is a significant rise in the average intensification\
    \ rate of nearshore TCs on a global scale during 1979\u20132020."
  8: Mean TC intensification rate increases from -0.07 kt 6-hr-1 (1979-2014) to 0.03
    kt 6-hr-1 (2015-2050).
  10: "Pattern correlation coefficient of VWS changes between the CMIP6 ensemble mean\
    \ and the SWM's solution is 0.63 over the northern tropical-extratropical (0\xB0\
    \u201360\xB0N) oceans."
  11: "The zonal mean basic state is acting to decrease the VWS over Northeast Asia\
    \ and the North Indian Ocean, while simultaneously causing a slight increase in\
    \ shear near 40\xB0N over North America."
  14: The reference to Kossin et al. (2020) mentions a 'Global increase in major tropical
    cyclone exceedance probability over the past four decades'.
