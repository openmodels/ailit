Drivers of Risk:
  1: Tropical cyclone intensification, increases in relative humidity, decreases in
    vertical wind shear, amplified warming in the upper troposphere, changes in heating
    patterns.
  4: Changes in nearshore tropical cyclone intensification rates.
  12: Heightened nearshore intensification rate of tropical cyclones (TCs) leading
    to stronger winds and heavier precipitation, potentially increasing the risk of
    coastal flooding and economic loss.
Highlights:
  1: "Tropical cyclone intensification rates have increased in near coastal regions\
    \ over the 42\u2010year period 1979\u20102020. Climate models project a continued\
    \ increase in nearshore TC intensification rates with decreasing windshear playing\
    \ a crucial role."
  4: Nearshore TC intensification rates show noticeable changes between the periods
    1979-1999 and 2000-2020. The difference between the periods is statistically significant
    (p=0.04).
  8: TCs will strengthen faster in the nearshore region in the future climate. The
    change in nearshore TC intensification is greater than in the offshore region
    in most coastal areas, except near the west coast of Mexico and the Australian
    coast, where changes are insignificant.
  12: Anticipated strengthening of landfalling TCs' destructive capacity and potential
    for substantial economic losses due to exacerbated storm surges and coastal flooding.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of observations, atmospheric reanalyses, and high-resolution climate
    models. Idealized numerical experiments with an intermediate complexity model.
  4: The study analyzes observed changes in global 24-hr TC intensification rates
    in the near-shore region over the period 1979-2020, using a Student's t-test for
    difference of means. Monte Carlo method is used to estimate error bars. Data are
    sub-sampled to ensure statistically similar storm state distributions for the
    two periods.
  12: Analysis based on historical and projected changes in vertical wind shear (VWS)
    and diabloic heating, enhanced tropical upper-level warming using satellite measurements,
    and comparisons against CMIP6 models.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on nearshore tropical cyclone intensification and its response
    to climate change at the global scale. The intensification is linked to vertical
    wind shear and relative humidity changes, with projected future increases.
  4: "The analysis focuses on nearshore regions within 3\xB0 of the coastline. Parameters\
    \ are averaged over June-October (Northern Hemisphere) and December-April (Southern\
    \ Hemisphere)."
  12: Future studies are needed to understand changing nearshore TC intensification
    in various regions and intermodel spread in SST warming patterns.

Quantitative material:
  1: "Global mean TC intensification rate increase of about 3 kt per 24\u2010hr in\
    \ regions close to the coast (over the period 1979\u20132020)."
  4: The study presents probability distributions of 24-hour TC intensification rates
    for two periods (1979-1999 and 2000-2020), mean TC intensification rates for the
    two periods with corresponding sample sizes, and the mean difference including
    the p-value (0.04).
  8: Mean TC intensification rate for 1979-2014 is -0.07 kt 6-hr-1.  It increases
    to 0.03 kt 6-hr-1 for 2015-2050.
