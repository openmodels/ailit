Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in climatic conditions, short-term variation and medium-term changes
    in average regional temperatures and precipitation
  2: Moderate changes in temperature and precipitation.
  3: Changes in temperature and precipitation
  4: Rising temperatures, particularly in the Arctic and northern regions of Russia,
    and the associated effects such as increased heat waves, changing growing seasons,
    and shifting pest populations.
  5: Increasing average temperatures and precipitation; increased frequency of extreme
    weather events; forest and peat fires; flooding; land erosion; public health challenges;
    thawing of permafrost.
  7: No relevant information
  8: Annual temperature realization, precipitation.
  10: Temperature and precipitation are considered as drivers of risk, with potential
    non-linear effects of temperature.
  11: Weather and climate change (specifically temperature).
  15: Changes in annual (lagged) temperature and precipitation.
  17: Regional average temperature increase, indicated by climate change, is impacting
    total expenditures.
  18: Temperature and precipitation changes.
  19: Temperature change in Russia, as projected by CRU climate scenarios A2 and B1.
  20: Temperature rise affects regional public expenditures; impacts are non-linear
    with potentially dramatic effects from large temperature increases.
  21: Climate variables like temperature and precipitation are considered drivers
    impacting expenditure.
  23: Changes in temperature and precipitation affecting expenditures.
Highlights:
  1: There is a strong and robust negative (but non-linear) relation between regional
    budget expenditures and population-weighted temperature; warming leads to decreased
    public expenditure
  2: The study aims to fill the research gap in econometric analysis of public adaptation
    costs of climate change. It highlights the effects caused by moderate changes
    in temperature and precipitation on regional government expenditure in Russia.
  3: Temperature rise reduces regional government expenditures in cold regions over
    the short term. Weather benefits accumulate, i.e. warming tends to have a larger
    medium-term effect on decreasing regional government expenditures than in the
    short term.
  5: "Russia perceives potential net economic benefits from climate change but also\
    \ faces serious climate change challenges. Any gains from climate change will\
    \ be unevenly distributed across Russia\u2019s regions."
  7: The paper aims to contribute to the literature by offering an alternative way
    to estimate fiscal costs of climate change, based on historical data from a large,
    heterogeneous economy experiencing warming, addressing the gap in evidence on
    the impact of moderate, but persistent, changes in climate on public finances.
  11: Expenditures seem to have the most robust fit with the first lag of the temperature
    variable. Public ownership of housing is much higher in colder regions.
  17: The LD model results show a significant cumulative temperature effect on total
    expenditures, which is much larger than the short-term FE model estimate.
  18: Temperature has a statistically significant negative impact on total expenditures.
    Precipitation also has a statistically significant negative impact on housing
    expenditures (in the cut-tails model). The impact of HDD (heating degree days)
    on expenditures in warmer regions suggests that increased HDD leads to decreased
    expenditures, while in colder regions, increased HDD leads to increased expenditures.
    The paper finds that Russia is generally a cold country and thus might not need
    much air conditioning, and also Russia is still relatively poor, especially its
    warmest regions, and thus might not have a high coverage of air conditioning.
  19: Climate change, specifically warming temperatures by the 2020s, is projected
    to lead to small savings in Russian regional government expenditures, ranging
    from USD 2 billion to USD 4 billion under different climate scenarios.
  20: Short-term temperature rise reduces expenditures in cold regions, negligible
    in warmer regions, and reverses in hottest regions; potential long-term benefits
    with adaptation and intensification effects.
  21: Significant coefficients suggest the impact of climate factors on public expenditure
    components.
  23: Significant effects of temperature on total and housing expenditures; industrial
    growth has consistent positive effects on expenditures.
Methodology:
  1: "Econometric analysis using a sub-national dataset for Russia covering 1995\u2013\
    2009 to estimate the impacts of changes in climatic conditions on regional government\
    \ expenditures."
  2: Econometric analysis of public adaptation costs of climate change using sub-national
    data for Russia. The analysis focuses on the effects of moderate changes in temperature
    and precipitation on regional government expenditure.
  3: Analysis of annual data from 1995 to 2009 across 78 Russian regions using econometrics
    to estimate the impact of temperature on regional government expenditure per capita.
  7: The paper proposes an alternative way to estimate fiscal costs based on realized,
    historical data from a large, heterogeneous economy experiencing warming.
  8: Fixed-effects (FE) model with regional and time dummies.
  10: Linear Difference (LD) model is used and compared to fixed effects (FE) models.
    The LD model is preferred due to its properties in removing omitted region fixed
    effects. The paper also employs both linear and quadratic specifications for the
    climate variables to account for non-linearities. Includes control variables relevant
    to government expenditures.
  11: Panel data models (FE and LD). Driscoll and Kraay standard errors are used in
    the FE model to account for spatial and temporal dependence. Heteroskedasticity
    robust standard errors are used for the LD model. Models consider lags of independent
    variables (temperature).
  15: Fixed effect estimates using linear and quadratic models with regional data,
    robustness checks by removing 5% of the tails of temperature and precipitation
    variables. Population-weighted average effect of regional effects is used to obtain
    a rough nationwide effect. The panel data study uses the lagged temperature.
  17: The analysis uses a Long-Difference (LD) model to estimate longer-run climate
    impacts including adaptation and potential intensification effects, while the
    Fixed-Effects (FE) model captures short-term impacts.
  18: Long-difference estimations are used to analyze the relationship between climate
    variables and expenditures. Models are estimated using full data and data excluding
    5% of both tails from temperature and precipitation variables. The analysis uses
    regional data from Russia.
  19: "The study uses regional temperature predictions from climate scenarios multiplied\
    \ by regional temperature gradients (derived from a quadratic function) to estimate\
    \ regional impacts on government expenditures. The reference point is average\
    \ temperature for 1995\u20131999."
  20: Analysis through short-term variation and mid-term change in temperature using
    regional-level dataset, with short-term providing a no-adaptation benchmark and
    mid-term capturing potential adaptation effects.
  21: Quantitative econometric models analyzing the impact of temperature and precipitation
    on expenditures.
  23: Long-difference and fixed effects estimations with robust standard errors, excluding
    5% tails in temperature and precipitation variables for some analyses.
More Notes:
  1: The benefits from warming accumulate and that adaptation measures could help
    leverage those benefits.
  2: The study uses temperature and rainfall as proxies for climate change. The aim
    is not to achieve a complete picture of climate change impacts.
  3: The results concern climate change with respect to changes in temperature and
    precipitation only. Russia is a useful benchmark in quantifying potential fiscal
    effects of global changes in climate due to its size, versatile climate, and the
    significant effect of the public sector. The discussion only reflects regional
    government expenditure impacts in the case of mild climate change and reactive
    adaptation.
  4: Temperature increases in Russia are nearly double the global average; impacts
    include longer growing seasons and changes in energy demand for heating and cooling.
  5: The paper suggests a potential conflict between perceived economic benefits and
    actual long-term risks due to climate change.
  7: The paper notes that climate-related variables are largely absent from discussions
    on determinants of public expenditure, which are usually grouped into macroeconomic,
    demographic, and institutional categories.
  8: The model uses annual weather variation and mid-term climate change to estimate
    climate impacts on regional expenditures.
  10: The paper analyzes data from Russian regions, and geographic correlation might
    affect error terms.
  11: Regional expenditure figures are deflated with regional consumer price indices
    (cpi). As a robustness check, expenditures are also deflated using the annual
    price of the regional consumption basket. The paper analyzes data from Russia.
  15: The causality of the Communist Party variable is unclear.  The study acknowledges
    potential endogeneity issues, particularly concerning the Communist Party variable.
    The analysis focuses on regional differences and their implications for nationwide
    effects, emphasizing the importance of considering non-linearities in climate
    impacts for policymaking.
  17: Results from the LD model should be treated with caution due to a small amount
    of available data and potential unaccounted variables; robustness check performed
    using degree day variables.
  18: The paper suggests that GDD (growing degree days) does not seem to affect outcomes
    in both linear and quadratic models and in short and longer-run analyses, possibly
    due to the relatively small role of regional governments in supporting Russia's
    agricultural sector. The authors use simplistic proxies (temperature and precipitation)
    to describe climate change.
  19: The analysis only considers temperature change and does not fully account for
    the uncertainties associated with precipitation changes. The authors used scenarios
    A2 and B1 for illustrative purposes and based the study on data until the 2020's
    only because benefits from warming become increasingly uncertain after that.
  21: The document seems to be heavily focused on econometric analysis with numerous
    variables and coefficients.

  19: Under the B1 climate scenario, Russian regional governments may save between
    USD 2 billion to USD 4 billion (in real terms, non-discounted) between 2000 and
    the 2020s due to warming. Under the A2 climate scenario, the savings range between
    USD 2 billion to roughly USD 3.5 billion over the same period.
