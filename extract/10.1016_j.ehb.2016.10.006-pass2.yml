Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increasing purchase prices and droughts affecting subsistence farmers in rural
    Senegal.
  2: Climate variability, international food price changes, and macroeconomic responses
    in Senegal.
  3: Drought, income/price shocks, loss of a household member
  6: Food price fluctuations and natural disasters worsened stunting and undernourishment
    among children below 5 years between 2005 and 2010; a surge in the price of domestic
    and international food products in 2011 challenged food security.
  9: Adverse events affecting rural households in Senegal include increased purchase
    prices and droughts, with more adverse events reported in 2011 due to high food
    prices.
  10: Drought shocks, price increases, other shocks from the natural, biological,
    economic, and health spheres
  11: Price increases and drought shocks
  14: Droughts and increased purchase prices.
  15: Drought shocks
  16: Droughts and price increases (economic shocks). Also shocks from natural, biological,
    and health spheres.
  17: Price shocks, drought shocks, shock-prone environments.
  26: Drought (SPI3 < -1), Extreme cold, Crop pest, Increase in purchase prices, Decrease
    in sales prices, Loss of key income source, Death of HHa member.
  28: Drought, extreme cold, crop pest, increase in purchase prices, decrease in sales
    prices, loss of key income source, death of household member.
  29: Drought, Extreme cold, Crop pest, Increase in purchase prices, Decrease in sales
    prices, Loss of key income source, Death of HH member
  30: Drought, Extreme cold, Crop pest, Increase in purchase prices, Decrease in sales
    prices, Loss of key income source, Death of HH member.
Highlights:
  1: Droughts and increased prices perceived as more severe in 2011, but children's
    health unaffected due to increased rural household income when both shocks occur.
  2: Multiple shocks may worsen household welfare more than single shock analysis
    would predict.
  3: Drought and income/price shocks have the most adverse effects on child weight-for-age.
  9: In 2011, droughts and increasing prices are not significantly correlated, indicating
    they are exogenous to each other.
  10: Drought and price shocks have negative impacts on child weight-for-age. The
    drought estimate is most significant, accounting for 42% of the pooled weight-for-age
    standard deviation, and the price shock for 19%.
  11: No relevant information
  14: Droughts and increased prices have a negative impact on child weight-for-age;
    the concomitance of increased prices and drought shocks has a positive but insignificant
    effect on child weight-for-age, suggesting competing price and income effects.
  15: Multiple shocks have interdependencies that need careful consideration. Groundnut
    production can offset the impact of drought shocks on child health, but groundnut
    production historically leads to more droughts.
  16: Droughts and price increases have a pronounced negative impact on child health
    in the short run. Households dependent on agriculture and asset-poor households
    are the most adversely affected by shocks. Concomitant drought and price shocks
    may have offsetting effects.
  17: Growing up in poor shock-prone environments does not necessarily preclude child
    opportunities to develop. Effects of shocks on urban children and households are
    expected to be different from those on rural children and households.
  26: Drought has a statistically significant negative impact in columns (8) and (9)
    where intensity is used. Loss of key income source and death of household member
    are statistically significant in both panels (A and B). The interaction terms
    'Year 2011 * Increased Prices * Drought' is statistically significant in column
    (11).
  28: Drought has a statistically significant negative impact on households cultivating
    peanuts, particularly when the male breadwinner is a farmer. Extreme cold has
    a statistically significant positive impact on households when the male breadwinner
    is not a farmer. Death of household member has a statistically significant positive
    impact on households when the male breadwinner is a farmer.
  29: For asset-poor households, drought and loss of a key income source have statistically
    significant negative impacts. For asset-rich households, crop pest has a statistically
    significant negative impact. The effects are not consistently significant across
    all model specifications.
  30: Drought has a statistically significant negative impact on girls (columns 8
    and 9). Extreme cold has a statistically significant positive impact on boys (columns
    8-11). Loss of a key income source has a statistically significant negative impact
    on boys (columns 8-11).
Methodology:
  1: Employs a multi-shock approach and unique dataset of children in rural Senegal
    from 2009 and 2011 to assess the impact of shocks.
  2: Adopts a multi-shock framework to analyze the economic consequences of environmental
    problems and price developments, focusing on micro-level data.
  3: Analysis based on a repeated cross-section of children measured in the context
    of a household survey in rural Senegal in the second quarter of 2009 and 2011
    after the second international food price spike (February 2011).
  9: The analysis employs sub-sample analyses to address robustness and coherence,
    uses self-reported survey data on shocks validated against external data, and
    investigates the determinants of reported price increases with a probit model.
  10: Non-parametric estimates for the 2009 and 2011 cross-sections. Econometric model
    with two periods and location fixed effects for a repeated cross-section of children.
    Multivariate shock analysis using a basic child health model including child,
    mother, and household characteristics.
  11: OLS estimates are used to assess the impact of shocks on child health; interaction
    models analyze price and drought shocks with structural changes.
  14: Multi shock estimates conditional on child, household, and village observables
    and survey year (2009 and 2011); use of interaction terms to account for competing
    effects of shocks; robustness checks including redefined shock measures, additional
    control variables, and sub-samples.
  15: Household-level data on precipitation from the African Drought and Flood Monitor
    (AFDM, 2014) used to create objective drought measures. Examines impact on anthropometric
    outcomes (child health). Includes control variables like height-for-age and groundnut
    production.
  16: Multiple shock analysis for rural Senegal, robustness checks, and sub-sample
    analyses. Results are applicable in the short run.
  17: Analysis of the effects of shocks on children in rural households.
  26: 'Fixed effects estimations with clustered standard errors are used. Two sets
    of regressions are presented: one using perceived intensity of shocks on a Likert
    scale and another using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI3) based on geo-referenced
    climatic information. Village-year or region fixed effects and clustering are
    used. The models include control variables like age and gender of household members,
    education, land ownership, and ownership of assets.'
  28: Village-year fixed effects estimations with standard errors clustered at the
    village level. The sample is split based on whether the main occupation of the
    male breadwinner is farming. Additional control variables are included such as
    age and gender of the child, head of household and mother.
  29: "Village-year fixed effects estimations with standard errors clustered at the\
    \ village level. The regressions control for age and gender of the child, head\
    \ of the household and mother\u2019s age and gender, if the mother resides in\
    \ the household, mother\u2019s literacy, if the mother is related to the head\
    \ of the household, number and size of parcels of land cultivated, ownership of\
    \ poultry, livestock, radio and mobile phone, dummy variables for water, toilet\
    \ facilities and migrant members."
  30: "Village-year fixed effects estimations with standard errors clustered at the\
    \ village level. All shock variables are dummy variables. The study uses subsamples\
    \ of boys versus girls. The analysis includes additional control variables such\
    \ as age and gender of the child, head of the household and mother\u2019s age\
    \ and gender, if the mother resides in the household, mother\u2019s literacy,\
    \ if the mother is related to the head of the household, number and size of parcels\
    \ of land cultivated, ownership of poultry, livestock, radio and mobile phone,\
    \ dummy variables for water, toilet facilities and migrant members."
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on child malnutrition, utilizing weight-for-age Z-scores as
    a measure, and considers structural changes between 2009 and 2011.
  3: The dataset contains a very rich shock module for vulnerable, rural households
  9: The reference period for shock variables is not the key drought period for Senegal
    but covers the lean season which may still affect agricultural production and
    food scarcity.
  10: The analysis controls for child-specific characteristics, socio-economic status,
    environmental quality, and other community characteristics in the multivariate
    analysis.
  11: Triple interactions consider effects of increasing prices and drought shocks
    together.
  14: The results suggest that the concomitance of drought and price shocks does not
    increase the severity of these shocks but can be mitigating the individual shocks.
  15: The study acknowledges that the GPS location of households may not accurately
    reflect the location of cultivated plots, which affects the precision of precipitation
    data for crops.
  16: The paper highlights the vulnerability of the poor to environmental and economic
    shocks and the dependence on agricultural land.
  17: The paper focuses on the impact of shocks on child welfare and development,
    particularly in rural areas. The analysis suggests that the effects of shocks
    can be both positive and negative, and that policy interventions are needed to
    minimize vulnerability and maximize resilience.
  26: The table presents robustness checks. The dependent variable is not explicitly
    stated but is influenced by shocks and controlled-for variables like age, gender,
    education, and asset ownership. The analysis seems to focus on the impact of shocks
    on household welfare or related microeconomic outcomes. The P-value of F-test
    joint sign. Drought coeff. is significant in columns (10) and (11), which may
    suggest how much drought affects purchase prices under different years.
  28: The effects of the shocks appear to differ depending on the occupation of the
    male breadwinner, suggesting that farmers are more vulnerable to some shocks (e.g.,
    drought) and less vulnerable to others (e.g., extreme cold, death of household
    member). Interaction terms with Year 2011 and Increased Prices and Drought are
    also included in some specifications.
  29: The dependent variable for the regression analysis is not explicitly defined
    in the provided information. The inclusion of Year 2011 interaction terms suggests
    an attempt to capture time-specific effects. The 'Increased Prices * Drought'
    interaction terms may indicate an attempt to identify compound effects.
  30: The specific outcome variable being analyzed is not explicitly stated on this
    page. The interpretation of the coefficients is unclear without knowing the dependent
    variable.
