  7: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change leading to increased cooling demand for buildings, resulting in
    increased emissions of air pollutants from power plants.
  2: Climate change, increased building energy use (specifically air conditioning),
    and power sector emissions.
  3: Increased use of air conditioning leading to higher emissions from power plants,
    impacting air quality in the context of a warmer climate.
  4: Increased air conditioning use in response to warmer temperatures leading to
    increased power plant emissions.
  7: Climate change leading to warmer temperatures and increased cooling demand, resulting
    in increased power sector emissions.
  9: Changes in air quality (PM2.5, O3) driven by climate change and adaptation strategies
    (increased cooling demand leading to power sector emissions).
  10: Increased cooling demand due to warmer temperatures leading to increased electricity
    production and emissions, specifically CO2 emissions.
  11: Climate change leading to increased temperatures and cooling demand. Changing
    sensitivity of electricity generation to temperature.
  12: Climate change leading to increased cooling demand (adaptation); Increased electricity
    production from fossil fuels to meet cooling demand.
  13: Climate change adaptation of cooling demand (specifically changes in power plant
    dispatch).
  14: Climate change leading to increased cooling demand, resulting in greater emissions
    of NOx and SO2 associated with electricity generation.
  16: Climate change adaptation of cooling demand leading to changes in air quality
    (PM2.5 and O3 concentrations) due to emissions.
  17: Climate change leading to changes in building energy use, impacting PM2.5 and
    Ozone concentrations.
  19: Climate change is the primary driver of risk, with increases in temperature
    leading to higher cooling demand and subsequent air quality impacts. Adaptation
    measures, specifically increased cooling demand, can also worsen air quality and
    increase health risks.
  20: Climate change, specifically a warmer mid-century climate, driving increased
    air conditioning demand.
  21: Increased electricity demand for cooling in a warmer climate leads to increased
    power plant emissions, impacting air quality and health.
Highlights:
  1: Increased cooling demand from climate change can worsen air quality, impacting
    human health.
  2: Adaptive behavior (extra air conditioning use) contributes to a significant portion
    of increased air pollution-related mortality and associated costs due to climate
    change.
  3: The study finds that increased air conditioning exacerbates air pollution and
    related health impacts, stressing the need for cleaner energy sources and energy
    efficiency.
  4: Climate change adaptation (air conditioning) can increase population health risks
    by increasing power plant emissions; shows health benefits of green building movement
    and reducing energy demand in buildings.
  9: Air-quality-related health impacts from climate change adaptation of cooling
    demand. Assessed increased incidence of premature mortality and morbidity associated
    with exposure to higher daily mean PM2.5, maximum daily 8-hour average (MDA8)
    O3, and maximum daily 1-hour O3. Focuses on mortality, which is not pooled as
    standard practice in the EPA methodology.
  10: Adaptation through air conditioning use constitutes a positive climate feedback
    due to increased electricity demand and CO2 emissions. The increase in electricity
    production is greater than the increase in CO2 emissions due to a shift towards
    natural gas power plants.
  11: Climate change increases average hourly emissions of NOx and SO2 due to greater
    frequency of high emissions, even though peak hourly emission rates do not increase.
    Cleaner energy sources are important in reducing future harmful emissions.
  12: Adapting to climate change by increasing air conditioning use leads to significant
    increases in air pollutant emissions and PM2.5 and O3 concentrations, offsetting
    some of the benefits of adaptation.  The largest increases in PM2.5 occur in and
    downwind of the Ohio River Valley.
  13: Adaptation strategies for cooling demand can lead to increases in PM2.5 and
    O3 concentrations in many regions. A small decrease in concentrations is observed
    in the southeast (centered over South Carolina and the Chesapeake Bay).
  14: Climate change and adaptation measures (increased air conditioning use) worsen
    air quality, leading to increased PM2.5 and ozone concentrations.
  16: Climate change adaptation related to cooling demand can lead to significant
    increases in premature mortality and associated economic costs due to air quality
    impacts (PM2.5 and O3).
  17: Increased building energy use due to climate change is projected to cause significant
    economic costs related to air quality health impacts, specifically from PM2.5
    and Ozone exposure. Adaptation strategies (MCA) are compared to climate-only scenarios
    (MCCO).
  19: Adaptation strategies, while intended to mitigate climate change impacts, can
    exacerbate air quality and health risks, leading to an 8.7% increase in mortality
    compared to climate change alone. The economic cost of mortality due to climate
    change impacts and adaptation strategies is substantial, estimated at $32.5 billion
    in the MCA-PD scenario.
  20: Adaptive behavior, specifically increased air conditioning use, exacerbates
    the health burden of climate change by degrading air quality. The study quantifies
    the relative contributions of climate change alone and adaptive behavior to the
    overall health burden.
Methodology:
  1: Interdisciplinary linked model system including WRF, RBESS, MyPower, CMAQ, and
    BenMAP. The model simulates climate, building energy demand, power sector production
    and emissions, air quality, and health outcomes. Simulations were performed for
    present-day and mid-century climate scenarios, with and without exacerbated power
    sector emissions from adaptation in building energy use.
  2: Health impact assessment using concentration-response functions, modeling air
    quality and power sector emissions, based on a single model-year of future climate
    simulations for the month of July.
  3: Computer models were used to calculate air pollution and health impacts with
    and without increased use of air conditioning.
  4: Deploys a novel interdisciplinary modeling effort to quantify air pollution and
    health impacts of climate change adaptation mechanisms.
  7: The study uses climate and meteorological modeling with simulations of air quality.
    Meteorology is downscaled from NARCCAP, using the A2 emissions scenario of the
    IPCC. A single year (2069) from the CCSM version 3 downscaled with the WRF model
    is selected to represent a warm, realistic mid-century summer. Building energy
    demand is modeled using RBESS, based on DOE-2 software and regional building stock
    data.
  9: "Used CMAQ model for air quality simulations (for July), and EPA's BenMAP\u2013\
    Community Edition version 1.3 to assess health impacts based on exposure-response\
    \ functions. Utilized Monte Carlo ensembles to calculate mean impacts and uncertainty."
  10: The analysis focuses on the health impacts of exacerbated pollution in July,
    using a 3-month summer average based on July modeling to estimate annual impacts.
    Air pollution and health impacts are calculated, focusing on incremental impact
    of adaptation.
  11: The analysis simulates energy production and emissions based on temperature
    changes between present-day and mid-century climates, maintaining the existing
    power plant inventory.
  12: Analysis of air quality in present-day climate and emissions (PD), mid-century
    climate only (MCCO), and mid-century adaptation scenarios (MCA); Regional average
    comparison of PM2.5 and O3 concentrations between scenarios.
  13: Comparison of air pollution concentrations between a warm mid-century climate-only
    scenario (MCCO) and a warm mid-century adaptation scenario (MCA). The results
    are applicable to the mid-century.
  14: Atmospheric modeling (CMAQ) used to simulate air quality impacts of climate
    change and adaptation strategies. Results apply to mid-century (MC) climate conditions,
    compared to present-day (PD).
  16: Impacts are presented as annual impacts, estimated as a 3-month summer average
    based on July modeling.
  17: The study uses concentration-response functions and valuation methods to estimate
    the economic cost of mortality associated with PM2.5 and Ozone exposure. Different
    concentration-response functions from various experts and studies are used. Results
    are for July exposure. It compares mid-century climate-only scenarios (MCCO) with
    mid-century adaptation scenarios (MCA) and present-day scenarios (PD).
  19: The study calculates premature mortality based on exposure to air pollutants,
    specifically MDA8 O3 and PM2.5, using concentration-response functions from multiple
    studies. The BenMAP model is used to estimate health impacts, but it does not
    account for interaction effects between pollutants. The analysis focuses on mid-century
    impacts.
  20: The paper simulates adaptive behavior to a warmer mid-century climate to assess
    the impact of increased air conditioning use on air quality and health outcomes.
  21: The study models the interactions amongst climate, electricity production, air
    quality, and health. It uses C-R (concentration-response) functions for O3 and
    PM2.5 to assess health impacts.
More Notes:
  1: This paper focuses on air-quality-related health impacts, not macroeconomic or
    macro-fiscal impacts.
  2: The study models only one month (July) and one model-year of future climate simulations,
    limiting its ability to project future damages definitively.
  3: This study provides the first examination of future air-pollution-related health
    damages from power plant emissions driven by increased electricity demand for
    air conditioning.
  4: The study focuses on the indirect health impacts of adaptation measures (increased
    air conditioning), which is often not included in air quality modelling studies.
    This paper quantifies the air pollution and health impacts of this adaptation
    mechanism.
  7: The study focuses on the impact of increased power sector emissions on air quality
    due to climate change and increased building air conditioning demand.
  9: The findings are exploratory and illustrative due to being based on a single
    year of climate simulations (July). The study does not monetize health impacts,
    nor does it compare direct heat-related mortality reduction from air conditioning
    with air pollution effects from related electricity demand.
  10: "Results in tables represent July exposure impacts, while values in the text\
    \ are annual impacts based on estimated annual exposure calculated as a 3-month\
    \ summer average based on July modeling. The study focuses on mortality results\
    \ in the main text, with morbidity results available in supporting tables (S2\u2013\
    S4)."
  11: The analysis does not consider the impact of retiring coal-fired power plants
    or renewable energy investments, which would likely result in lower emissions.
    The focus is on understanding interactions between climate, energy production,
    and air quality, not on making precise predictions.
  12: The study focuses on the eastern US; Figure 3 provides histogram data on electricity
    production and emissions under present-day and mid-century scenarios.
  13: The greatest increase in emissions is in EGU (Electricity Generating Unit) emissions.
    The decrease in concentrations in the southeast is due to a decrease in emissions
    associated with power plant dispatch changes. The number of hours with high pollution
    levels increases due to the adaptation.
  14: Biogenic emissions are a dominant contributor to the PM2.5 increase under climate
    change. The state-by-state variation in EGU emissions is shown in Figure 5.
  16: Results are specific to the eastern US and Ohio River Valley, and the analysis
    is limited to July air quality, so cannot be directly compared with annual NAAQS.
  17: The paper uses expert functions and Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory
    Impact Analyses. The age range differs for some C-R functions.
  19: The study provides spatial distributions of mortality by county, differentiating
    the impacts of PM2.5 and ozone. The independent health impact estimates from exposure
    to PM2.5 and O3 cannot be directly summed due to limitations in the BenMAP model.
  20: End-of-pipe technological controls can reduce pollution exposure but increase
    energy requirements. Building energy efficiency measures and renewable energy
    sources are presented as alternatives.
  21: The study models only a single representative month from 1 year in future climate
    projections, rather than a 30-year average due to computational limitations. The
    study does not project future changes to population, air pollution exposure patterns
    in humans, building stock, and the electric power sector.

    \ GWh (28.6%). Regionally summed average hourly eastern US CO2 emissions increase\
    \ from 169,000 to 200,000 metric tonnes (18.3%). Shift in the maximum ambient\

    \ behavior (extra air conditioning use); Present-day and mid-century statistics\
    \ (mean, min, max) for hourly electricity production, CO2 emissions, NOx emissions,\
    \ and SO2 emissions are provided."
  13: Percentage change in PM2.5 and O3 concentrations from a climate-only scenario
    to an adaptation scenario (ranges from -10% to 10%).
  14: Adaptive behavior causes approximately a 1% increase in O3.
  16: "Total impact of climate and adaptation (MCA\u2013PD) causes a mean of 13,547\
    \ premature deaths (mean estimate range across studies: 1,320 to 26,481) based\
    \ on the average of all functions (roughly the sum of climate alone and adaptation\
    \ alone), with mean costs of $126 billion (mean estimate range across studies:\

  17: PM2.5-related mortality costs range from $1 billion to $12 billion annually
    due to increased building energy use in a mid-century climate scenario, with an
    average of $6 billion. Ozone-related mortality costs average $3 billion due to
    increased building energy use in a mid-century climate scenario, based on 3 standard
    configuration studies with a range of $2 billion to $4 billion.
  19: Premature mortality from all causes and MDA8 O3 exposure due to climate change

    deaths (range of 1,671 to 3,111). The average number of deaths in the MCA-PD scenario
    is 3,514 (range of 2,175 to 4,920). Adaptation increases mortality by 8.7% above
    climate change impacts alone. The cost of mortality in the MCA-PD scenario is
    estimated at $32.5 billion. The costs of morbidity impacts vary from $0 to $45
    million annually for PM2.5, $0 to $39 million annually for MDA8 O3, and $6 million
    to $18 million for maximum daily 1-hour O3.
  20: "The increase in air-pollution-related health outcomes attributable to climate\
    \ change alone is 92%\u201395% of the overall health burden, while changes in\
