Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate-induced financial instability
  2: Climate change affecting the productivity of labour and the stock of capital;
    increasing stocks of capital at risk from climate-related events leading to firm
    insolvencies and non-performing loans.
  3: Climate change impacts on labor productivity and capital stock, leading to financial
    crises and bank bailouts.
  4: Climate-induced effects on the banking sector and public finances across scenarios,
    climate damages affecting the microeconomic behaviour of firms and workers cause
    a significant amount of additional non-performing loans, threatening solvency
    of financial institutions.
  5: Labour and capital damages due to climate change are identified as factors impacting
    GDP growth and the probability of bank bailouts.
  6: Climate change impacts on the energy industry and banking system; Secondary systemic
    effects of banks' equity deterioration; firms' equity holding by banks.
  7: Climate damages lead firms to bankruptcy, causing financial strain on banks which
    in turn affects macroeconomic dynamics.
  10: Climate impacts on the financial system.
Highlights:
  1: The paper quantifies the public costs associated with climate-induced financial
    instability.
  2: Climate change will increase the frequency of banking crises and the fiscal burden
    of rescuing insolvent banks; neglecting the financial system in climate-economy
    integrated assessment may lead to an underestimation of climate impacts; financial
    regulation can play a role in mitigating these impacts.
  3: Climate change has significant negative effects on economic growth, increasing
    firm insolvencies and bank bailouts. The impacts are stronger when climate damages
    hit labor productivity. Around 20% of the reduction in growth rate is attributable
    to financial distress. Macroprudential regulation plays a pivotal role in climate
    risk management.
  4: Climate damages affecting firms and workers can cause a significant amount of
    additional non-performing loans, threatening the solvency of financial institutions
    and requiring extraordinary support from the government. Public costs of climate-induced
    banking instability are significant, potentially reaching 30% of GDP in an SSP5
    future.
  5: Climate change scenarios with labor and capital damages depict lower GDP growth
    and increased public bailout costs compared to baseline scenarios with no climate
    change.
  6: Macroprudential policies are central in managing climate-induced financial risks.
    Direct and indirect effects (linked to contagion phenomena) on the financial system
    need to be considered, as well as regulations mitigating this potential vicious
    cycle. There exists a U-shaped relationship between costs of restructuring in
    the banking sector and its lending propensity.
  7: The analysis focuses on the public costs of banking fragility due to climate
    change, illustrating the link between climate-induced financial distress and macroeconomic
    impacts.
  10: Investigates climate impacts on the financial system and the ensuing public
    costs in SSP5 and SSP1 like scenarios.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis involves modelling financial instability driven by climate change.
  2: "Agent-based climate\u2013macroeconomic model calibrated on stylized facts, future\
    \ scenarios and climate impact functions affecting labour and capital; SSP5 scenario\
    \ as central case; Monte Carlo analyses with 500 model runs."
  3: Monte Carlo exercise of size 500, simulating the effects of climate change (SSP1
    and SSP5 scenarios) on macroeconomic and financial indicators.
  4: Model simulations (500 simulations) are used to assess the impact of climate
    damages on the banking sector and public finances. The model considers scenarios
    with capital stock damages, labour productivity damages, and labour and capital
    damages. Results are presented as 10-year averages, yearly averages, and 90% confidence
    intervals.
  5: The analysis uses simulation models covering the periods from 2000 to 2099, including
    Monte Carlo exercises with different parameter combinations to derive outcomes.
  6: Integrated assessment models of climate change should include a financial system
    and financial regulation authorities.
  7: The novel Dystopian Schumpeter meeting Keynes (DSK) model is used in an agent-based
    simulation to analyze the impacts of climate change on the financial system.
  10: Uses an agent-based climate-economy integrated assessment model.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on financial instability as a key channel through which climate
    change impacts macroeconomic outcomes.
  3: 'The paper considers three climate impact scenarios: labor productivity damages,
    capital stock damages, and both labor and capital damages.'
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Public costs of climate-induced financial instability
  2: Banking crises frequency; fiscal burden from rescuing insolvent banks (as % of
    GDP); public debt to GDP ratio.
  3: GDP growth, firm insolvency likelihood, banks' equity-to-total asset ratio, public
    bailouts per 10 years, cost of bailouts per year (% GDP), average debt-to-GDP
    ratio.
  4: Average number of bailouts, bailout costs (% of GDP), public debt behaviour (Debt-to-GDP
    ratio).
  6: Climate damages reverberate to the financial system, inducing feedback loops
    that sharpen macroeconomic damages. Deviations from optimal capital adequacy policies
    exacerbate bailout costs as temperatures rise.
  7: "Economic losses due to temperature changes are modeled, with specific losses\
    \ at +3\xB0C and +6\xB0C being 2.1% and 8.5% respectively."

    and the public costs of bank bailouts related to climate-induced financial distress.

  2: "Climate change will increase the frequency of banking crises (26\u2013248%);\
    \ Rescuing insolvent banks will cause an additional fiscal burden of approximately\
    \ 5\u201315% of gross domestic product per year; increase the ratio of public\
    \ debt to gross domestic product by a factor of 2; around 20% of such effects\

    \ change."
  3: "Under SSP5, annual GDP growth is reduced from 3.5% in the baseline to 2.0-2.9%.\
    \ Firm insolvency likelihood increases from 15.2% in the baseline to 32.4-47.1%.\
    \ Public bailouts increase from 9.1 per 10 years to 11.5-22.6. Bailout costs rise\
    \ from 10.3% of GDP to 14.6-25.0%. Debt-to-GDP ratio increases from 0.83 to 1.38-1.77.\
    \  Under labour and capital damages, the burden for the public budget moves from\
    \ a yearly estimate of 17.5% (95% CI: 8% to 24%) of GDP for a temperature anomaly\
