Drivers of Risk:
  3: Climate change impacts on river time series (hydrological projections); changes
    in water use and leakage; future population (low, central, and high scenarios).
  6: Population growth and climate change
  7: Socio-economic, climatic and institutional changes are identified as uncertainties
    that drive risk in water management.
  8: Population growth, climate change (drier climates), sustainability reductions,
    demand management, leakage management
  9: Population growth and climate (wetter/drier conditions).
  10: Climate change scenarios (Low&Wet, Central, High&Dry) affecting water availability;
    Population growth impacting water demand; Leakage rates; Per capita consumption
    reductions; Sustainability reductions
  11: Climate change impacts (implicitly through different climate scenarios), population
    growth, and demand management strategies.
  12: Population increases leading to higher water demand and leakage
  13: Population growth, climate change, unsustainable use of natural water resources
  14: Climate change (affecting water supply and demand); Socio-economic scenarios
    (population growth, economic development); Inter-company transfer reliance.
  17: Population growth, climate change (wet/dry)
  19: Population growth, climate change (specifically drought conditions), sustainability
    reduction, demand management, leakage management.
  20: Population growth, climate change (wet vs. dry climate), demand growth, sustainability
    reduction, demand management, leakage management.
  22: "Changes in water demand (\u0394\u0BBC), distance of water transfer (\u07DC\
    ), various population and climate scenarios (Low population & wet climate, Central\
    \ population and climate, High population & dry climate), asset capacity."
Highlights:
  6: No relevant information
  7: The paper assesses the effectiveness of different national water management strategies
    considering the water trilemma. It calculates cumulative costs and CO2 emissions.
  8: System Efficiency (SE) and System Restructure (SR) strategies are the only two
    that reduce total water use in the face of population growth.
  9: National Planning (NP) and System Restructure (SR) strategies have much higher
    cumulative costs compared to No Build (NB) or Minimum Intervention (MI) across
    all scenarios. High & Dry scenarios generally lead to higher costs and CO2 emissions
    compared to Low & Wet scenarios.
  10: The 'high and dry' scenario leads to water shortages in most WRZs if only current
    (2015) infrastructure is available in 2040. National Planning (NP) shows significantly
    increased Cumulative Opex as compared to the other scenarios. The system efficiency
    (SE) strategy assumes higher per capita consumption reductions.
  11: Widespread reduction in per capita consumption (SE strategy) alone is not able
    to prevent reliability issues in all water resource zones (WRZs) in all climate
    and population scenarios. The Capacity Expansion strategy can achieve similar
    levels of reliability to the Minimum Intervention strategy but with higher water
    abstraction and emissions. The National Planning strategy aims to provide water
    security across the entire region.
  12: System Restructure (SR) strategy, despite higher costs, is preferred for its
    cost-effectiveness and supply security whereas System Efficiency (SE) performs
    better environmentally
  13: A more strategic approach to water resources planning is needed in Great Britain
    to address population growth, climate change, and unsustainable water use, framed
    by the "water trilemma".
  14: Demand management and leakage reduction are 'trilemma-friendly' solutions (robust,
    flexible, scalable, low carbon); A balanced approach is recommended, combining
    inter-basin water transfers with local solutions (water re-use, demand management,
    leakage reduction).
  17: The analysis models the impact of investment in water supply infrastructure,
    changes in water use, and leakage on water availability under different population
    and climate scenarios. Net demand growth is calculated under Low, Central, and
    High population and climate scenarios.
  19: Net demand growth for public water supplies increases significantly under a
    high population and dry climate scenario.
  20: Net demand growth for public water supply increases from 2015-2040 as population
    increases and climate becomes drier. Demand growth is the most significant contributor
    to change in water supply, with sustainability reduction, demand management, and
    leakage management playing smaller roles.
  22: Different water management strategies (Demand Management, Leakage Management)
    have varying impacts on water supply depending on the population and climate scenario.
    Demand growth has the largest impact on net demand in a High population & dry
    climate scenario.
Methodology:
  3: Development of a high-level national water resources model within the ITRC National
    Infrastructure Systems Model (NISMOD). The model accounts for water use and the
    reliability of water supplies at the scale of Water Resource Zones (WRZ). It uses
    aggregate estimates of surface and groundwater availability in each WRZ and simulates
    the effect of storage, transfer, re-use and desalination supply infrastructure.
    Matlab is used for hydrological yield modelling, and Microsoft VB.Net for the
    long-term water supply and infrastructure modelling.
  6: A number of variants on the least cost planning strategy were developed to test
    alternative options for the provision of water on a national scale. Each strategy
    represents a different approach to policy intervention, choices of technologies
    used to increase supply or decrease demand, and policies around promoting inter-company
    transfers.
  7: The study uses a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach, specifically
    the ELECTRE III method, to compare different water management strategies based
    on the water trilemma (security, affordability, and sustainability). Three preference
    sets (No preference, Security and Cost, Green is Good) are developed, weighting
    each component of the trilemma differently, and used to rank strategy performance
    across various scenarios of future uncertainty.
  8: ELECTRE III method is used, with sensitivity analysis performed using the OutrankingTools
    package in R-project. The analysis projects supply/demand balance in 2040 under
    different scenarios and water management strategies.
  9: 'The analysis uses a model to simulate the impact of different water management
    strategies under three scenarios: Low & Wet, Central, and High & Dry. The model
    projects outcomes to 2040 (or 2030 for some cost measures) based on assumptions
    about population growth and climate.'
  10: Modelling of water balance in 2040 under different strategies and scenarios,
    considering demand growth, sustainability reductions, demand management, and leakage
    management. The paper uses scenarios for population, climate, sustainability reductions,
    leakage reduction rates, and per capita consumption reductions to model water
    availability and cumulative operating expenditure from 2015 to 2040.
  11: The analysis involves simulating water balances for each water company in 2040
    under different socio-economic and climatic scenarios using different investment
    strategies ('No Build', MI, SE, CE, NP).
  12: Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) using ELECTRE III algorithm ranked strategies
    based on performance across scenarios and preference sets
  13: Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to rank different water resource management
    strategies under different preference sets and climate change scenarios. Modeling
    of water demand management and leakage reduction strategies
  14: A streamlined water supply-demand balance model at a water resource zone level,
    incorporating water storage, demand and leakage management, inter-zonal transfers,
    and geographically explicit estimates of changing water demand; The model is used
    to analyze water management strategies across different scenarios and stakeholder
    preferences.
  17: The Great Britain Water Infrastructure Model (GBWIM) is used to track the water
    balance and availability of water at the Water Resource Zone (WRZ) scale. Future
    Flows Hydrology (FFH) dataset is used for baseline water supply projections. Water
    supply assets are compiled from WRMPs, water company drought plans, internet research
    and interviews with water company staff.
  19: Water yields from rivers and reservoirs are calculated using equations that
    consider minimum residual flows, licenced maximum abstractions, and reservoir
    storage. Reservoir yields are calculated using an iterative numerical approach.
    Different scenarios are presented showing the projected changes in water supply
    based on population and climate conditions.
  20: The analysis converts river flows to sustainable yields for each Water Resource
    Zone (WRZ), uses catchment size as a proxy for proportional hydrological conditions,
    amalgamates rivers intakes and reservoirs into lumped models, and identifies monthly
    minimum acceptable storages for the composite reservoir.  A relationship between
    yield (YR) and storage (S) is established, increasing YR until the criterion for
    acceptable failure rate is violated.
  22: Cost-benefit analysis of different water supply investments using a Total Present
    Value Cost minimization algorithm. Regression models are used to estimate Capex
    and Opex costs for different asset options, considering factors like asset capacity,
    water transfer distance, and demand changes. Discount rate is set at 5%. The chart
    shows impacts for 2015-2040.
More Notes:
  6: 'The analysis uses different management strategies to address supply-demand deficits
    related to water availability on a national scale. These strategies are: No Build
    (NB), Minimal Intervention (MI), Capital Expenditure (CE), National Planning (NP),
    and System Efficiency (SE).'
  7: The study examines the trade-offs between reliability, affordability, and sustainability
    in water management. It considers different perspectives on the water trilemma
    and uses weighting to reflect these perspectives in the MCDA algorithm.
  8: The study models water management strategies and their impact on water supply,
    CO2 emissions and other factors under different population and climate scenarios.
    The maps visualize the geographical distribution and regional responsibilities
    of the various water companies in the UK.
  9: The paper focuses on the water sector and assesses various strategies to manage
    water supply and demand under different climate and population conditions. The
    maps provide context on the water company regions but do not provide macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal information. The bar charts break down drivers of water supply
    but do not provide concrete cost information.
  10: The analysis uses Deployable Outputs (DO) to estimate water supply volumes.
    The water balance results under the NB strategy are also presented geographically.
    The maps of water company jurisdictions in the UK and regions in England and Wales
    are relevant contextual information, especially as they relate to the regionalised
    water shortage outcomes the authors discuss, but do not present specific data
    points themselves.
  12: The analysis suggests two main strategies (SR and SE) balance between cost,
    security of supply, and environmental criteria, based on MCDA results
  13: The uniform application of demand management and leakage reduction may have
    handicapped their modelled performance; in practice, these measures could be scaled
    more flexibly and be more cost-effective.
  14: Past policy decisions suggest a strong preference towards water security and
    affordability in Great Britain.
  17: The model considers surface and groundwater availability in each WRZ. Representative
    river gauges are used for each WRZ, and composite river abstraction sub-catchments
    are created. The model accounts for demand growth, sustainability reductions,
    demand management, and leakage management.
  19: The analysis seems focused on water resource management and the impact of climate
    change on water availability, but it does not directly address macroeconomic or
    macro-fiscal outcomes in terms of GDP, budget balance, etc.
  20: The model assumes no reservoir management rules are implemented and uses the
    drought plan of the largest reservoir in the WRZ to identify acceptable storage
    levels. The water system is considered to have failed if the minimum acceptable
    storages are exceeded more regularly than the return period.
  22: The analysis focuses on the water sector. The map illustrates water company
    jurisdictions, providing context for regional implementation of water management
    strategies.
