Drivers of Risk:
  18: Climate change (specifically, decreasing Arctic sea ice).
Highlights:
  18: Arctic sea ice coverage is decreasing significantly, as illustrated by the comparison
    of sea ice concentrations in September between earlier and later years.
Methodology:
  18: Uses Earth Observation (EO) data and analysis of sea ice concentrations over
    time.
More Notes:
  18: The paper suggests that EO data can be a central tool in driving the Paris Agreement's
    ambition cycle and can bridge global and local perspectives on climate change
    impacts.

  15: This page focuses on Essential Climate Variables (ECVs), sensors, and their
    potential applications for monitoring climate change and supporting the Paris
    Agreement objectives. It does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes, costs, or benefits of adaptation at a national level.

  18: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  18: The total sea ice area has decreased by around 25% between the periods represented
    by the upper (1979, 1981, 1983) and lower (2017, 2019, 2021) rows of maps in Figure
    10.
