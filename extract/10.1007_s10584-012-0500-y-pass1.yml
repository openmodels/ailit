Drivers of Risk:
  3: Climate change in Colombia by 2050 under the A2 scenario of the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES-A2) and the
    overall trends in both precipitation and temperature to 2100.
  5: Climate change, extreme weather events, pests, and diseases.
  6: Shifts in the geographic distribution and incidence of pests and diseases and
    extreme weather events are identified as drivers of risk to crop yields.
  8: Projected increases in temperature and precipitation are expected to impact agriculture
    in Colombia, with significant variations in regions and altitude.
  9: Changes in precipitation affecting plant growth, soil water availability, and
    biotic factors (pests, diseases, weeds).
  11: Phonological alterations due to climate change; climate variability; temperature
    increases
  12: No relevant information
  13: No relevant information
  14: Climate change is the primary driver of risk, impacting agriculture.
  15: Changes in crop phenology, shifts in distribution of pests and diseases, changes
    in the climatic niche of coffee, potential decreases in sugarcane yields, high
    temperature stress, drought, effects of CO2 fertilization.
  22: Changes in temperature and rainfall under the SRES-A2 emission scenario by the
    2050s.
Highlights:
  3: Climate change in Colombia will likely impact 3.5 million people and 14% of national
    GDP related to agriculture by 2050.
  5: Predicted climate change will threaten the entire Colombian socio-economic system,
    with particularly severe impacts on agriculture.
  6: The analysis focuses on the impact of climate change on Colombian croplands,
    considering temperature, precipitation, and seasonality changes for the years
    2040-2069 under the SRES-A2 emissions scenario.
  8: Agricultural adaptation can be improved through government support like agricultural
    insurance and adaptation loans, which will be crucial due to climate sensitivity.
  9: Climate change will impact agricultural production, particularly affecting smallholders.
    Precipitation changes are a fundamental factor driving impacts and adaptation.
  11: Investing in rice adaptation and sugarcane adaptation is cost-effective (benefits
    offset costs). Coffee production requires special attention due to its economic
    importance.
  12: No relevant information
  13: No relevant information
  15: Climate change is expected to impact crop phenology, pest/disease distribution,
    coffee production, and potentially sugarcane yields in Colombia. Adaptation requires
    governmental support for research, agricultural insurance, and multidisciplinary
    approaches. Data availability is a critical constraint.
  22: "Significant portions of key export crops like coffee, sugarcane, and African\
    \ oil palm are projected to experience temperature increases between 2-3\xB0C.\
    \ Precipitation changes also vary significantly across crops, with some crops\
    \ like sugarcane heavily skewed towards increased rainfall (3-5%). Soybeans are\
    \ projected to almost entirely experience 2.5-3\xBAC temperature increases."
Methodology:
  3: Querying national data sources to characterize the agricultural sector and using
    17 Global Circulation Model (GCM) outputs to quantify how Colombian agricultural
    production may be affected by climate change, focusing on the years 2040-2069
    ('2050') under the SRES-A2 scenario.
  5: "Uses 17 global circulation models (GCMs) for the SRES-A2 emission scenario (\u201C\
    business as usual\u201D) and the 2050s time frame to analyze the impacts of climate\
    \ change on Colombian agriculture."
  6: The study uses a literature and statistical data review, builds upon the first
    communication to the UNFCCC, analyzes climate model data, examines climatic changes
    on Colombian perennial and annual crops (using data from DANE, 2007), and proposes
    adaptation strategies. The GCM data were downscaled to a 10 arc-minute resolution
    using the method of Ramirez-Villegas and Jarvis (2010).
  9: Classification of changes in precipitation and temperature for Colombian agriculture,
    using methods described in supporting material (Sect. 5). Analysis considers temperature
    changes up to the 2050s.
  11: Rice adaptation benefits were shown using CIAT work; sugarcane adaptation costs
    were estimated by EMBRAPA.
  12: No relevant information
  13: No relevant information
  14: The paper calls for comprehensive and holistic (economic, biophysical, and social)
    sector-based and regional assessments to determine negative impacts and future
    opportunities related to climate change.
  15: Numerical analysis and qualitative assessment of impacts and adaptation options;
    modeling the likely impacts of climate change on agricultural production at the
    regional level using crop response data, socio-economic data, crop distribution
    data, and downscaled climate projections.
  22: Analysis projects the impact of temperature and rainfall changes on crop production
    in a specific country by the 2050s, assuming the SRES-A2 emission scenario.
More Notes:
  3: The paper highlights the need for multidisciplinary focus (agronomic, economic,
    and social) and investments in data collection, impact assessments, research and
    development, and technology transfer, and the need for support to vulnerable smallholders
    via agricultural insurance.
  5: The paper proposes a set of adaptation measures that include the definition of
    key financial flows and stakeholders. The analysis focuses on the impacts on the
    most vulnerable sectors of Colombian agriculture.
  6: The study analyzes the agricultural system by departments/regions and groups
    of agricultural goods (cereals, oilseed/legumes, high value export perennials,
    non-export perennials, and livestock production). In 2007, crop production represented
    55% of the total value of agricultural production and the remaining 45% was livestock.
  9: The paper acknowledges that changes in inter-annual variability, flooding and
    slide risks, and extreme events are of high relevance but difficult to model accurately.
  11: The page focuses on adaptation strategies in agriculture (rice, maize, soybean,
    common beans, cassava, sugarcane, and coffee). Adaptation subsidies are mentioned
    as a transversal strategy. Altitudinal migration is suggested as a coffee adaptation
    strategy in response to rising temperatures.
  12: This page focuses on adaptation strategies for smallholders in the agricultural
    sector in Colombia. It highlights the need for technology transfer, funding strategies,
    agricultural insurance, and improved data collection and access. However, it does
    not provide quantitative assessments of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  13: No relevant information
  14: The Ministry of Agriculture (MADR) is identified as the national authority in
    charge of investment flows for climate change adaptation in the agricultural sector.
  15: The paper highlights the scarcity of data and modeling approaches tuned for
    assessing climate change impacts and adaptation costs in Colombia. It also emphasizes
    the need for regional climate modeling, field evaluations, technology deployment,
    and uncertainty assessment.
  22: The table provides a detailed breakdown of the projected impact of climate change
    on specific crops, disaggregated by departments within the country. The impact
    is primarily assessed in terms of the percentage of cropland affected, not in
    monetary terms or direct economic output.
No relevant information:
  20: This page primarily presents projected climate changes (temperature and precipitation)
    across different regions of Colombia. It does not contain information on macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes, costs/benefits of adaptation, or the methodologies used to
    derive those outcomes. Therefore, it's not directly relevant to the specified
    categories related to economic impacts or adaptation effectiveness.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Climate change will likely impact 14% of national GDP corresponding to agriculture
    in Colombia.
  5: Impacts on Colombian agricultural GDP (10-14% of total GDP), livelihoods of 3.7
    million people, food security, exports (40% of total exports).
  6: Short-term vulnerability and food security are key outcomes that require governmental
    support.
  9: Impacts on agricultural production at different levels.
  11: Adaptation strategies such as irrigation systems and a rice genetic improvement
    and research center for rice are completely off-set by increases in agricultural
    yields and income by the 2030s. Costs of developing new sugarcane varieties resistant
    to lodging and with higher yields at high temperatures are estimated to completely
    offset the costs of not adapting or mal-adapting.
