Drivers of Risk:
  1: "El Ni\xF1o events, natural variability in precipitation, changes in the mean\
    \ climate (increased greenhouse gases), delayed monsoon onset, changes in the\
    \ annual cycle of rainfall"
  2: "Delayed monsoon onset due to El Ni\xF1o events and climate change."
  3: Changes in mean temperature, large-scale dynamical circulation in the tropics,
    future emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, climate sensitivity to these
    emissions, and regional climate responses to changes in atmospheric and ocean
    conditions, changes in annual cycle of precipitation.
  5: Increased temperatures, increased CO2 concentrations, monsoon onset delay, lower
    soil moisture, changes in the annual cycle of rainfall.
Highlights:
  1: Marked increase in the probability of a 30-day delay in monsoon onset in 2050
    as a result of changes in the mean climate; decrease in precipitation later in
    the dry season (July-September); adaptation strategies are needed in Indonesian
    rice agriculture, including increased investments in water storage, drought-tolerant
    crops, crop diversification, and early warning systems.
  2: "Delayed monsoon onset, particularly during El Ni\xF1o events, significantly\
    \ reduces rice production in Java and Bali, with potentially large impacts on\
    \ the Indonesian economy. A 30 day delay causes ~500-600k metric tons of rice\
    \ output reduction in West/Central and East Java/Bali."
  3: The likelihood of exceeding the 30-day monsoon onset delay threshold increases
    significantly relative to the current period, with substantial regional variation.
    Uncertainty in future greenhouse gas emissions is relatively insignificant compared
    to uncertainty in the response of large-scale circulation. Models generally show
    a greater likelihood of exceeding the monsoon onset delay threshold in 2050, although
    some models show a reduced probability.
  5: Increased temperatures and CO2 concentrations will affect rice yields in 2050,
    with a significant impact from temperature during the dry season; Monsoon onset
    delay impacts rice production; Adaptation measures are crucial for food security,
    including rice policy adjustments, water storage, drought-tolerant varieties,
    and crop diversification.
Methodology:
  1: "Risk assessment framework examining the potential impact of El Ni\xF1o events\
    \ and natural variability on rice agriculture in 2050; uses output from the Intergovernmental\
    \ Panel on Climate Change AR4 suite of climate models, forced by increasing greenhouse\
    \ gases, and scales it to the regional level by using empirical downscaling models;\
    \ compares the present vs. future likelihood of exceeding a seasonal climate threshold\
    \ (delayed monsoon onset)"
  2: Statistical analysis of observational records, econometric analysis of rainfall
    impact on planting area. Applicable to Indonesian rice agriculture, specifically
    Java and Bali. Analysis period 1979-2004 for monsoon data and 1983-2004 for rice
    production data.
  3: Empirical downscaling models (EDMs) are developed to map observed large-scale
    circulation patterns and humidity distributions to regional-scale precipitation,
    then applied to GCMs from the IPCC AR4 report under A2 and B1 emissions scenarios.
    Multimodel ensembles are used to create probabilistic climate projections.
  5: Least-squares regression models relate crop production variables to observed
    precipitation from 1979 to 2004; Monsoon onset was defined as the number of days
    past August 1 when accumulated rainfall equals 20 cm; Empirical dynamic modeling
    (EDM) is applied to project future patterns of precipitation over Java and Bali
    for 2050 using observed large-scale circulation fields.
More Notes:
  1: The analysis focuses on Java and Bali, which account for approximately 55% of
    Indonesia's total rice production.
  2: The paper selects a 30-day delay in monsoon onset as a critical threshold for
    risk assessment related to Indonesian rice agriculture.
  3: The coarse grid sizes of GCMs do not resolve the regional-scale interactions
    between the large-scale atmospheric circulation and the mountainous topography
    of Indonesia.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Annual rice deficits, food security (availability and access to staple food commodities)
  2: Decreased rice production due to delayed monsoon onset.
  3: Impacts on wet- and dry-season rice crops in Indonesia.
  5: "Rice yields in 2050 will be affected by increased temperatures and CO2 concentrations,\
    \ and are closely linked to mean minimum temperatures during the dry season, with\
    \ a 10% yield decrease for every 1\xB0C increase in minimum temperature. Rice\
    \ planting and harvesting will be affected by wet-season delays."
Quantitative material:
  1: Increase in the probability of a 30-day delay in monsoon onset in 2050 from 9-18%
    today to 30-40% at the upper tail of the distribution; substantial decrease (up
    to 75% at the tail) in precipitation later in the dry season (July-September)
  2: A 30-day delay in monsoon onset caused rice production to fall by 11% in East
    Java/Bali and 6.5% in West/Central Java; comparable drop in rice output of 600,000
    metric tons in West/Central Java and 540,000 metric tons in East Java/Bali; a
    20% drop in rainfall in April-June reduces planting area for Java and Bali by
    only 2%.
  3: Probability distributions of exceeding climate thresholds for rice agriculture
    in West/Central Java and East Java/Bali for 2050 are presented, including specific
    probabilities under A2 and B1 emissions scenarios.
  5: "Rice yields decrease by 10% for every 1\xB0C increase in minimum temperature;\
    \ Accumulation of 20 cm rainfall is needed for crop establishment."
