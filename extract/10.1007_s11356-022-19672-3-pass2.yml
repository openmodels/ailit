Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature shocks and thermal shocks affecting energy poverty and agricultural
    output.
  2: Inadequate accessibility to and incapacity to purchase renewable power alternatives,
    biased toward low-cost unclean fuel resources due to financial limitations caused
    by temperature extremes.
  6: Temperature shocks.
  7: Temperature shocks, defined as temperature variations of more than 2 standard
    deviations from long-term averages, are the main driver of risk.
  8: Temperature shocks (defined as departures from the long-term mean of several
    standard deviations) and Number of hot days
  9: Number of hot days and temperature shocks (lagged 2 and 3 years).
  10: Thermal shocks (temperature shock), low rainfall leading to drought and increased
    irrigation costs, and temperature rises impacting worker productivity.
  11: Temperature shocks (high temperatures)
Highlights:
  1: Temperature shocks worsen energy poverty in Vietnam by affecting agricultural
    productivity and increasing irrigation expenses during low rainfall.
  2: Short-term temperature variations have a significant impact on energy poverty
    in Vietnam.
  6: Temperature shocks increase energy poverty. The effect varies across different
    regions of Vietnam.
  7: Temperature shocks are found to increase the likelihood and intensity of multidimensional
    fuel poverty in Vietnamese households.
  8: Rising temperatures in northern and central coastal areas considerably enhanced
    the prevalence and intensity of multidimensional energy poverty. Thermal shocks
    also affected poverty (MEPI score) along the central coast and central highlands.
  9: Number of hot days is positively associated with MEPI status and MEPI score.
    Lagged temperature shocks have a statistically significant positive impact on
    MEPI status and score two years prior, but not three years prior. The impact of
    temperature shocks is heterogeneous across urban/rural and Kinh/minority populations.
  10: Thermal shocks have a statistically significant and deleterious impact on agricultural
    crops, leading to reduced agricultural productivity and influencing household
    income, which in turn affects multidimensional energy poverty. Household earnings
    and agricultural production mitigate the negative impacts of thermal shocks on
    multidimensional energy poverty.
  11: Higher temperatures contribute to multidimensional energy poverty in Vietnam;
    Temperature shocks cause families to sacrifice greener energy sources; Impacts
    are concentrated in Vietnam's northern and central coastal areas; Rural families
    are more affected than city dwellers.
Methodology:
  2: Analysis is based on the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS), using
    a linear prediction framework to estimate effects of temperature variations on
    energy consumption.
  6: Regression analysis is used to assess the impact of temperature shocks on energy
    poverty. The analysis uses Vietnamese Longitudinal Surveys.
  7: The study uses econometric analysis to estimate the impact of temperature shocks
    on energy poverty. The residuals of a logarithmic regression of agricultural productivity
    based on humidity and temperature are used to create the temperature shock factor.
    The analysis considers the impact on household energy consumption and acknowledges
    adaptive responses.
  8: "Regression analysis using panel data, independently for each of Vietnam\u2019\
    s four regions. Uses different definitions of temperature shocks (various standard\
    \ deviation cutoffs) and looks at lagged effects."
  9: Regression analysis with province and/or year fixed effects, province-specific
    linear time trends, and survey time fixed effects is employed. Control variables
    include household factors (age, sex, education level, family size, roof type)
    and geographical characteristics (average rainfall and population density). Standard
    errors are clustered at the regional level.
  10: The analysis uses regression analysis to examine the mechanism whereby thermal
    shock causes multidimensional energy poverty. MEPI status and scoring variables
    are added as mediators to the baseline regression. The analysis controls for province
    fixed effects, year fixed effects, province linear time trends and survey time
    fixed effects. Robust standard errors are used.

    analysis using lagged temperature shock variables.
More Notes:
  6: Additional controls, province fixed effects, year fixed effects, province*linear
    time pattern, and survey time fixed effects are included in the regressions, depending
    on the specification.
  7: This paper primarily focuses on the impact of temperature shocks on multidimensional
    energy poverty (MEPI) at a household level in Vietnam. While it touches upon potential
    macroeconomic impacts, the core analysis remains microeconomic.
  8: Household factors (age, sex, education level, family size, roof type) and geographical
    characteristics (average rainfall and population density) are also used as control
    measures.
  9: The paper finds that temperature shocks have a more significant impact on rural
    populations and minority groups (compared to Kinh majority). It is suggested that
    minorities, particularly those in highlands, are more exposed to income shocks
    due to lack of infrastructure/services and reliance on agriculture.
  10: The paper suggests that the heat shock factor has nearly no statistical validity
    in affecting the MEPI score.
  11: The study suggests that international society must step up measures to reduce
    carbon dioxide production to limit potential temperature spikes. Tailored policy
    interventions are needed, focusing on the most vulnerable regions.
