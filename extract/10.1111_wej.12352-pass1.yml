Drivers of Risk:
  2: Potential increases in water demand, uncertainties in water availability due
    to climate change (difficult to predict precipitation patterns, projected temperature
    increases intensifying evapotranspiration), population growth (concentrated in
    the south-east of England), over-abstraction from water bodies, and other environmental
    stressors.
  3: Growing pressure on water supplies.
  5: Future scenarios of socio-economic demand and future river flow series (based
    on low, medium, and high emissions scenarios) impact water supply.
  8: Population growth and climate change increase demand for water supplies.
  9: High population growth and drier climatic conditions (High & Dry scenario) impact
    water supply and associated costs.
  10: Different climate scenarios (Low&Wet, Central, High&Dry) affecting water supply
    and demand.
  11: Climate change (different climate scenarios), population growth (different population
    scenarios), demand management strategies (or lack thereof), investment in water
    infrastructure
  12: Population increases, climate change (wet vs. dry climate scenarios), and demand
    for water are key drivers impacting water supply.

Highlights:
  2: A balanced approach which allows for some inter-basin water transfers while also
    engaging local solutions, including water re-use, combined with scalable actions
    for demand management and leakage reduction, will best enable Britain to navigate
    the water trilemma.
  3: "Proposes a pragmatic approach to national water resources assessment and applies\
    \ this methodology to test a wide range of possible investments and policies to\
    \ secure the resilience of Britain\u2019s water supplies."
  5: The paper focuses on simulating adaptive strategies for water resource management,
    aiming to minimize the total present value costs of investments needed to balance
    water supply and demand under different future scenarios.
  8: System Efficiency (SE) and System Restructure (SR) strategies are the only ones
    that reduce total water use in the face of population growth. The No Build (NB)
    strategy sees water supplied, CO2e emissions, and reliability increase with higher
    population growth and drier climates.
  9: National Planning (NP) strategy shows the highest cumulative costs and CO2 emissions
    across scenarios.
  10: "Most Water Resource Zones (WRZs) experience water shortages in the \u2018high\
    \ and dry\u2019 scenario, and many in the \u2018central\u2019 scenario if only\
    \ current (2015) infrastructure assets are available in 2040."
  11: Demand management (SE strategy) reduces water abstraction and CO2e emissions
    but widespread reduction in per capita consumption is not, on its own, able to
    prevent reliability issues in all WRZs in all climate and population scenarios;
    Capacity expansion (CE strategy) achieves similar reliability as MI strategy,
    but with far more water being abstracted, and higher emissions; National planning
    (NP) strategy is able to provide water security across water companies.
  12: System Restructure (SR) and System Efficiency (SE) are the most preferred water
    management strategies. The SR strategy is preferred overall due to cost and security
    of supply, while the SE strategy performs better on environmental criteria.
  13: The increasing challenges are prompting a more strategic approach to water resources
    planning.
  15: The High population & Dry climate scenario results in the greatest demand growth,
    with significant net demand despite management and leakage efforts. The Low population
    & Wet climate scenario exhibits less demand growth.
  17: The high population & dry climate scenario results in the greatest demand growth,
    with significant net demand despite management and leakage efforts.
  19: The paper calculates water supply yields based on a function related to the
    desired return period of drought, reflecting the return period of the minimum
    acceptable period set out in the water company drought plan for the shortest return
    period drought event.
Methodology:
  2: An aggregated national water resource model is used to simulate projections of
    river flows under population and climate change and to test potential policies
    to manage demand and investments in water supply infrastructure.
  3: Developed a high level national water resources model that accounts for water
    use and the reliability of water supplies at the scale of Water Resource Zones
    (WRZ). The model was built bespoke as part of the ITRC National Infrastructure
    Systems Model (NISMOD) using a combination of technologies, including Matlab for
    the hydrological yield modelling, and Microsoft VB.Net for the long-term water
    supply and infrastructure modelling. The model uses an aggregate estimate of surface
    and groundwater availability in each WRZ and simulates the effect of storage,
    transfer, re-use and desalination supply infrastructure, as well as changes in
    water use and leakage.
  5: A water resource management model simulates a 25-year planning horizon, revisited
    every 5 years. It calculates a supply/demand balance for each water resource zone
    annually. If a supply-demand imbalance occurs, the model identifies additional
    supply requirements, determines financial and carbon costs, and uses an algorithm
    to minimize Total Present Value Costs (TotPVC) per unit of water supplied.
  10: Modelling water balance for each company in 2040 under different scenarios and
    strategies. The results are applicable to the UK water sector.
  11: Simulation of water balances for water companies under different socio-economic
    and climatic scenarios and investment strategies.
  12: Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) using the ELECTRE III algorithm was
    used to rank the water management strategies based on various scenarios and preference
    sets. Sensitivity analysis was performed across 240 runs to evaluate strategy
    performance under different conditions. The results are applicable to the period
    up to 2040.
  13: A national perspective on water resources planning for Great Britain, framed
    in terms of meeting the 'water trilemma'.
  15: The paper uses scenarios to model future water availability based on population
    and climate conditions (Low population & Wet climate, Central population and climate,
    High population & Dry climate).
  17: The Great Britain Water Infrastructure Model (GBWIM) tracks the water balance
    and availability of water at the Water Resource Zone (WRZ) scale, aggregating
    estimates of surface and groundwater availability. It simulates the effect of
    investment in storage, transfer, re-use and desalination supply infrastructure,
    as well as changes in water use and leakage. Future Flows Hydrology (FFH) dataset
    is used for baseline water supply projections. River and reservoir sources are
    modelled in more detail, using representative river gauges and developing a database
    of water supply assets.
  19: Iterative numerical approach for calculating reservoir yields, considering minimum
    residual flows, maximum abstractions, and desired return periods of dry conditions.
    The model considers time series of annual minima of flow. Simulation models based
    on water company drought plans.
More Notes:
  2: The paper highlights the need for a strategic national perspective on the resilience
    of Britain's water supply systems, given the possibility of major inter-company
    transfers and new storage infrastructure.
  5: The analysis considers the impact of restoring sustainable abstraction rates
    and simulates adaptive strategies on both the supply and demand sides.
  8: The map of the UK regions and water companies is descriptive background information.
  10: The study utilizes population scenarios and sustainability reductions but acknowledges
    differences in assumptions compared to other studies (HR Wallingford, WaterUK)
    regarding leakage reduction rates, per capita consumption reductions, and drought
    scenarios.
  12: The paper evaluates different strategies to avoid Level 1 water restrictions
    under various socio-economic and climatic scenarios. The NP strategy avoids restrictions
    with heavy investment in reservoirs and water transfers, while the SR strategy
    uses a combination of demand management and investment in various water sources.
  13: The uniform application of demand management and leakage reduction may have
    handicapped the performance of system restructure (SR) and system efficiency (SE)
    strategies in the model. In practice, these measures could be scaled up and down
    more flexibly, making them potentially more cost-effective than modeled.
