Drivers of Risk:
  3: Global warming, measured by changes in temperature.
  4: Global warming, specifically rising temperatures.
  5: The key climate variable is annual mean temperature; also considers temperature
    bins, seasonal mean temperature, temperature variation, and temperature shocks.
    Includes annual total precipitation, wet day frequency, frost day frequency, cloud
    cover percentage, and vapor pressure as control variables.
  7: Global warming and inter-annual temperature fluctuations are identified as impacting
    factors on obesity outcomes.

  16: Warming (increase in annual mean temperature)
  17: Global warming is impacting obesity rates, particularly affecting females who
    have increased obesity rates by 0.81 percentage points.
  18: Temperature, specifically the number of days within certain temperature ranges
    and seasonal temperature variations.
  19: Temperature, both in discrete bins and as seasonal mean temperature, is a driver
    of obesity rates.
  20: Temperature increases in high-temperature seasons significantly raise the obesity
    rate.
  22: Positive temperature shocks (months with temperatures at least one standard
    deviation above the long-run average for the same month) and global warming.
  23: Global warming, leading to changes in income, food prices, consumption preferences,
    working hours, physical activity, and minimum calorie requirements.
  24: Warming, specifically annual mean temperature
  25: The primary driver of risk is annual mean temperature.
  26: Projected temperature changes from 2016 to 2050
  27: Projected warming from 2016 to 2050 using the intermediate emissions scenario
    SSP2-4.5.
  28: The drivers of risk are warming temperatures and their effect on income, particularly
    in tropical and subtropical zones.
  29: The primary driver of risk is rising annual mean temperature due to global warming.

Highlights:
  3: Global warming will increase the number of obese adults worldwide by 89.9 million
    from 2016 to 2050. This could lead to an economic loss of US $276.6 billion.
  4: First study to directly examine the overall impact of warming on obesity based
    on long-run global data and to evaluate the potential of long-run adaptation in
    offsetting this impact.
  8: Temperature fluctuations allow the coefficient to capture the causal effect of
    temperature on obesity. The effect pattern remains the same even when year fixed
    effects are included in the model. The interaction between income and temperature
    is investigated to determine if the effect of warming on obesity varies with income.
  10: Warming has a significantly positive impact on the adult obesity rate.
  11: "Warming has a positive impact on obesity rates in most countries but a reducing\
    \ effect in tropical countries with a mean temperature above 27 \u25E6C."
  12: The marginal effects of temperature on obesity rates are more dispersed when
    income effects are considered but are comparable to the baseline model.
  13: A generally positive correlation between annual mean temperature and obesity
    rate is observed across different control scenarios, although the specific patterns
    vary. Within-country population migration and other sources of differential population
    growth have a minor effect on the estimated effect. Within-country adaptation
    and changes in population weight through factors such as migration, births, and
    deaths show a weak connection to the temperature/obesity relationship.
  14: Significant coefficients for regional and gender differences are reported, though
    the specific outcome evaluated is unclear.
  15: Higher GDP per capita reduces the impact of warming on obesity; older populations
    and increased schooling correlate with higher obesity impacts from warming.
  16: The impact of warming on obesity varies depending on GDP per capita, age, and
    education level; the marginal effect of warming on male obesity is roughly one-third
    larger than that on female obesity.
  17: Key outcomes include the gender differences in obesity rates due to exposure
    to global warming and the variation in impact by geographic region.
  18: Higher temperatures increase obesity, with the effect being more pronounced
    during warmer seasons; Lower temperatures may reduce obesity.
  19: The figures indicate a positive correlation between temperature increases (both
    in temperature bins and as seasonal mean temperature) and the marginal effect
    on obesity rates.
  20: Only the warming of high-temperature seasons can increase obesity rates, which
    is not captured by a baseline analysis using annual average temperature measures.
  22: Global warming may affect obesity by influencing calorie intake (through income,
    food prices, and consumption preferences) and calorie expenditure (through working
    hours, physical activity, and minimum calorie requirements). Macro-level factors
    such as changes in birth rates, death rates, and migration patterns may also influence
    the overall obesity rate of society.
  23: Global warming tends to reduce income and increase food prices. Lower real income
    tends to reduce obesity in poorer, tropical countries but increase obesity in
    wealthier, temperate countries. Warming reduces minimum calorie demand and potentially
    leads to decreases in outdoor sports and shorter working hours, contributing to
    obesity.
  24: Warming diminishes physical exercise and increases calorie and fat intake. Minimum
    calorie requirement diminishes in cold and temperate regions.  The effect of temperature
    on obesity is dependent on income.
  25: Higher temperatures initially increase and then reduce obesity rates.
  26: Global warming is likely to increase obesity in the majority of countries, with
    reductions observed in only a few tropical countries (based on short-run model).
    77 of those countries are expected to experience an impact greater than 1 percentage
    point. Long-run model indicates that global warming is likely to increase obesity
    in most countries from temperate zones while reducing obesity in most countries
    from subtropical and tropical zones.
  27: Global warming may lead to both increases and decreases in obesity depending
    on the climate zone, specifically increases in temperate zones and decreases in
    subtropical and tropical zones.
  28: Long-term adaptation may not significantly mitigate the impact of global warming
    on obesity. Warming may reduce income in subtropical and tropical zones, leading
    to increased obesity in the long run. The cumulative effect of warming over time
    outweighs adaptation in temperate zones.
  29: Global warming significantly increased obesity in most countries, except for
    a small number of tropical countries; long-term adaptation may not significantly
    mitigate the impact of global warming on obesity in temperate zones; the impact
    varies across countries with differing income levels, age structures, and education
    levels.
Methodology:
  3: Uses a baseline model with a third-degree temperature polynomial to account for
    the nonlinear impact of temperature on obesity. Alternative models use temperature
    bins, seasonal mean temperature, temperature variation, and temperature shocks.
    A 'long-difference' model is also used to capture adaptation.
  4: Examines the overall impact of warming on obesity based on long-run global data
    and evaluates the potential of long-run adaptation in offsetting this impact.
  5: "Uses climate data from the Climatic Research Unit, calculating country-level\
    \ climate measures as the population-weighted average across all climate grids\
    \ within each country, with population weightings derived from the LandScan Program.\
    \ Uses both the population in 2000 and 2016, or in each of the sample years as\
    \ the weights. Data are available from 1901 to 2018 on a 0.5\u25E6 \xD7 0.5\u25E6\
    \ grid covering land surfaces."
  7: Analysis is performed using a fixed effect panel model comparing the same country
    over time to estimate the causal effect of warming on obesity rates.
  8: The analysis uses country fixed effects to account for cross-country, long-run
    temperature differences. The model employs a J-degree temperature polynomial to
    capture the nonlinear effect of temperature. Robustness checks include using year
    fixed effects and four other methods to capture the nonlinear effect.
  10: Compares a short-run model (year-to-year temperature variations) to a long-run
    model (30-year temperature trends) to infer the effect of adaptation.  Uses country-specific
    year trends replaced with year fixed effects.  Models are estimated from 1975
    to 2016 for 152 countries, using temperature data from 1945 to 2016.
  11: Uses different versions of a model employing first- to fifth-degree temperature
    polynomials as the main explanatory variables, respectively. Also uses a model
    with a third-degree temperature polynomial and its interaction with log GDP per
    capita. The data are analyzed at the country level, with standard errors clustered
    at the country level.
  12: The analysis uses a third-degree model with and without income interaction to
    estimate the marginal effects of temperature on obesity.
  13: Regression analysis with various control variables (carbon emissions, crude
    death rate, year fixed effects) and population weighting methods (2016 population,
    population in each year) to assess the robustness of the relationship between
    temperature and obesity.
  14: The analysis includes fixed effects and interaction terms, with considerations
    of GDP per capita and adult schooling.
  15: The analysis is performed using a linear model with the inclusion of interaction
    terms to evaluate moderating effects of log GDP per capita, average adult age,
    and average adult years of schooling.
  16: Estimates are based on column 2 of Table 1 for heterogeneity analysis and columns
    3 and 4 for male/female obesity rate effects.
  17: The analysis uses a geographic exclusion approach to evaluate the significance
    of different regions and employs alternative temperature measures like temperature
    bins.
  18: "Uses a bins model to analyze the effect of temperature ranges on obesity, with\
    \ the 12-15\xB0C range as the base bin; Employs a polynomial model to derive the\
    \ marginal effect of temperature; Investigates seasonal temperature variations\
    \ using a uniform definition of seasons based on temperature rankings across months\
    \ within each country and estimates a baseline model; analyzes data across countries\
    \ and years, controlling for country-specific time trends and other variables."
  19: The analysis estimates models (9) and (10), clustering standard errors at the
    country level. Seasonal definitions are based on the ranking of monthly mean temperatures.
    A model with all four seasons is preferred to mitigate biases from temperature
    correlations.
  20: The analysis uses model settings including country fixed effects, a seasonal
    model with four seasons, and a method that examines the effect of within-year
    temperature variation on obesity using a third-degree polynomial.
  22: The response function of obesity to positive temperature shocks is constructed
    based on estimates from model (13). 95% confidence intervals are calculated based
    on standard errors clustered at the country level.
  23: Relies on findings from existing literature to infer channels through which
    warming impacts obesity. Uses a modified version of a model to estimate the effects
    of temperature on minimum calorie demand, physical exercise, calorie intake, and
    fat intake.
  24: The analysis employs modified versions of a model (1) with distinct dependent
    variables (minimum calorie demand, physical exercise index, per capita calorie
    intake, per capita fat intake) and model (6) for the long-run impact, using third-degree
    temperature polynomials as the key explanatory variable. Country-level and US
    state-level data are used.
  25: The analysis uses a long-run model (6) based on 30-year temperature trends to
    estimate the impact of warming on obesity. The model utilizes a third-degree temperature
    polynomial. Standard errors are clustered at the country level to calculate confidence
    intervals.
  26: 'The predictions are made through three steps: (1) estimate the nonlinear marginal
    effects of temperature on obesity using a third-degree version of model (1), (2)
    combine the estimated nonlinear marginal effects with the mean temperature of
    each country to calculate the country-level marginal effect, (3) multiply the
    country-level marginal effects with the predicted warming in each country to determine
    the projected effect of global warming on obesity in each respective country.
    The global warming prediction is based on the intermediate emissions scenario
    SSP2-4.5 from CMIP6.'
  27: Compares predicted impacts from short-run and long-run models to infer the effect
    of adaptation.
  28: The analysis uses short-run and long-run models to estimate the impact of warming
    on obesity, comparing the differences to assess adaptation potential. The applicability
    is to countries at different levels of economic development and in different climate
    zones.
  29: The study uses plausibly exogenous year-to-year temperature fluctuations to
    estimate the causal effect of global warming on obesity, considering temperature
    bins, seasonal temperature, temperature variation and temperature shocks. The
    findings also compare baseline results with a long-difference model to understand
    long term adaptation.
More Notes:
  1: Identifies substantial heterogeneity in the impact across countries with varying
    income levels, age structures, and education levels.
  3: "The marginal effect on obesity of a 1\xB0C increase in temperature ranged from\
    \ \u22120.56 to 1.87% across the 152 countries, with a population-weighted average\
    \ of 1.06%."
  10: The analysis uses temperature polynomials to model the temperature-obesity relationship,
    with a third-degree polynomial chosen as the baseline model.
  11: The effect of income on moderating the temperature-obesity relationship is limited.
  13: The study examines heterogeneity of the impact concerning income level, age
    structure, education level, gender, and geographic region (though details of these
    specific analyses are not on this page). The baseline model excludes year fixed
    effects to avoid concerns of extrapolation.
  14: No relevant information
  16: Sports activities, being more susceptible to temperature increases than physical
    labor, could explain the positive correlation of warming to obesity among those
    with higher education levels
  18: "The marginal effect of each temperature bin is interpreted relative to the\
    \ omitted base bin (12-15\xB0C); Potential multicollinearity exists among temperature\
    \ bins in the bins model; The definition of seasons is uniform across countries\
    \ and based on temperature rankings rather than calendar months."
  19: "The 12-15\xB0C temperature bin was excluded from model (9) due to perfect collinearity."
  22: The analysis considers both micro-level (individual factors) and macro-level
    (population structure) pathways through which global warming can affect obesity.
  24: Appendix Tables A.3 and A.7 contain variable definitions, summary statistics,
    and point estimates.
  25: "The long-run model's effect pattern is similar to the short-run model, but\
    \ the threshold temperatures differ significantly (18.5\xB0C vs. 27.3\xB0C)."
  26: Appendix Figures A.4 and A.5 depict the predicted impacts under the low emissions
    scenario SSP1-1.9 and the high emissions scenario SSP5-8.5, respectively.
  28: The paper suggests a more active role for the public sector in addressing the
    effect of global warming on obesity.
  29: The study acknowledges limitations due to the lack of long-term sub-country
    data on obesity, and the lack of annual data on the share of population with different
    BMI scales.
Quantitative material:
  1: "A 1 \xB0C increase in the annual mean temperature would result in a worldwide\
    \ increase in obese adults of 79.7 million, or 12.3%."
  3: Global warming significantly increased obesity rates in temperate zones but decreased
    it in 21 tropical countries.
  4: Findings suggest that global warming generally increases obesity.
  5: "Uses data from 1975 to 2016 for 152 countries with a population size larger\
    \ than half a million in 2000, representing 99.1% of the world\u2019s population\
    \ in 2000. Figure 1 illustrates that the adult obesity rate has significantly\
    \ increased from 1975 to 2016 across the 152 countries. Figure 2 displays the\
    \ distribution of the annual mean temperature across the 152 sampled countries."
  8: The paper presents a formula (equation 2) to calculate the response function
    of obesity to temperature. Equation 3 calculates the marginal effect of temperature
    on obesity in country i. Equation 4 incorporates the interaction between income
    and the temperature polynomial.
  10: Estimates the marginal effect of temperature on obesity.
  11: "Warming has a significantly positive impact on the adult obesity rate for most\
    \ countries, except for the 21 tropical countries with an annual mean temperature\
    \ above 27 \u25E6C, where it has a reducing effect."
  12: "A 1\xB0C increase in annual mean temperature results in an additional 79.7\
    \ million obese adults worldwide, with country effects ranging from -0.56 to 1.87\
    \ percentage points."
  13: Graphs show obesity rate percentage against annual mean temperature in degrees
    Celsius under different control scenarios.
  14: Significant coefficients are noted for various regions and genders (e.g., Asia,
    Europe) related to an unspecified outcome.
  15: A one-unit increase in log GDP per capita decreases obesity impact by 0.202
    percentage points; a 1-year increase in adult average age raises obesity impact
    by 0.026 percentage points; a 1-year increase in average schooling increases obesity
    impact by 0.019 percentage points.
  16: "A 1 \u25E6C increase in the annual mean temperature would increase the male\
    \ obesity rate by 1.28 percentage points."
  17: The analysis finds a 0.81 percentage point increase in female obesity rates
    due to global warming.
  18: "More days with temperatures under 9\xB0C would reduce obesity (compared to\
    \ the 12\u201315\xB0C bin); more days with temperatures above 15\xB0C would increase\
    \ obesity; warming of high-temperature seasons significantly increases obesity,\
    \ while warming of low-temperature seasons has a negligible effect on obesity."
  19: The graphs show the marginal effect on obesity rate (in percentage points) across
    different temperature bins and seasons.
  22: The obesity rate increases with the number of months experiencing positive temperature
    shocks. The graph shows a positive correlation between the two.
  24: The graphs show the relationships between annual mean temperature and minimum
    calorie demand, physical exercise index, per capita calorie intake, and per capita
    fat intake. The long-run impact of warming on obesity is also estimated.
  25: "The long-run model estimates a threshold temperature of 18.5\xB0C, above which\
    \ the relationship between temperature and obesity changes."
  26: Short-run model indicates global warming is likely to increase obesity in the
    majority of countries. Population-weighted average impact of warming on obesity
    across the 152 sample countries is 1.2 percentage points, which is statistically
    significant compared to the global obesity rate of 17.8% in 2016. Global warming
    will increase the number of obese individuals worldwide by 89.9 million from 2016
    to 2050. Global warming could result in an economic loss of approximately $276.6
    billion by increasing obesity worldwide.
  27: Global warming from 2016 to 2050 would result in 76.8 million more obese individuals
    in temperate zones and 106.9 million fewer obese individuals in subtropical and
    tropical zones.
  29: "A 1\xB0C rise in annual mean temperature would increase the number of obese\
    \ adults worldwide by 12.3%."
