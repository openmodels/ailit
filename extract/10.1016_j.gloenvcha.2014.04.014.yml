Drivers of Risk:
  3: Poor countries are more vulnerable to climate events than rich countries (adaptation
    deficit).
  4: Extreme weather events and future climate change.
  5: Climate variability, future climate change, extreme climate events, high exposure
    to climate risk (e.g., semi-arid climate, hazard zones), high sensitivity due
    to reliance on agriculture, adaptation deficit.
  6: Climate-related natural disasters.
  7: Natural disasters
  10: Floods and tropical cyclones (climate-related events).
  11: Intensity/magnitude of natural disaster events (e.g., wind speed) and sensitivity/exposure
    of society to events of given magnitude (I).
  12: Intensity of events (top wind speed for cyclones, precipitation for floods),

    exposure of a country to a given disaster type over the long-term).
  13: Floods, cyclones

Highlights:
  3: Focuses on understanding why poorer countries are more vulnerable to climate
    change events.
  4: Adaptation deficit is due to a demand effect (demand for 'climate security' increases
    with income) and an efficiency effect (adaptation productivity is enhanced in
    high-income countries due to infrastructure and institutions). Lower adaptation
    efficiency is associated with less government spending, uneven income distribution
    and bad governance.
  5: Low-income countries are more vulnerable to climate change due to exposure, sensitivity,
    and adaptation deficits. The adaptation deficit is potentially caused by inefficiencies
    in adaptation service provision and/or rational allocation of scarce resources.
  6: Rich countries demand more climate security (adaptation) due to a positive income
    elasticity and produce 'climate security' more efficiently due to strong social
    capital, institutions, regulatory standards and good public services.
  7: The paper focuses on explaining the severity of disaster losses and constructing
    country efficiency rankings in disaster management, differentiating itself from
    studies that focus on the effect of disasters on economic growth.
  10: Floods and tropical cyclones are the most significant climate-related drivers
    of disaster deaths and economic damages.
  12: Disaster losses are negatively associated with hazard exposure.  Long-term hazard
    exposure increases the incentive to undertake costly adaptation measures.
  14: Higher GDP per capita and better political institutions are associated with
    fewer disaster deaths, while higher income inequality is associated with more
    disaster deaths.
  15: Better Investment Profile reduces disaster deaths. Lower risk of religious tension
    reduces flood deaths. Lower risk of military influence/external conflict reduces
    tropical cyclone deaths. Higher government expenditure to GDP reduces deaths from
    floods and tropical cyclones. The relationship between primary school enrolment
    and disaster deaths is inconsistent. Higher credit-to-GDP ratios appear to be
    associated with increased disaster deaths.
  16: Higher GDP per capita is associated with lower economic damages from floods
    and tropical cyclones; Magnitude and Total GDP are significant predictors of economic
    damages from floods and tropical cyclones; The coefficients on GDP per capita
    are damage elasticities.
  17: Higher inequality is associated with lower economic damages from floods, possibly
    due to a 'location effect' where poorer people live in more vulnerable areas but
    own fewer assets. Higher inequality increases economic losses from tropical cyclones.
    Better institutions (lower political risk) are associated with higher economic
    damages from tropical cyclones. Trade openness reduces losses from cyclone events.
  18: Northern European countries are generally more efficient in handling flood events.
    The US ranks surprisingly low due to income inequality and low government spending.
    Bangladesh performs better than expected despite its poverty. Some sub-Saharan
    African countries perform surprisingly well. Countries with high adaptive capacity
    for floods also tend to have high adaptive capacity for tropical cyclones.
  21: The analysis focuses on the economic impact of floods and tropical cyclones,
    finding that magnitude variables are significant predictors of disaster losses.
  22: 'There is a strong demand effect: increased income reduces economic damages
    from climate disasters. Adaptation efficiency is not uniform, varying with government
    spending, institutional quality, and income distribution.'
  23: Closing the adaptation deficit requires general growth measures and dedicated
    assistance. Inclusive growth and institutional quality are important for development.
    The list of priority countries includes many vulnerable states, but also some
    surprises.
  28: Flood magnitude and population size are positively and significantly associated
    with the number of deaths from floods. GDP per capita and government expenditure
    are negatively and significantly associated with flood-related deaths. Income
    inequality (Gini coefficient) is positively and significantly associated with
    the number of flood deaths. Political and economic factors such as political risk,
    government stability, investment profile, and religious influence in politics
    also show significant associations with flood mortality.
  29: Higher cyclone magnitude and population are associated with significantly more
    deaths. Larger area is associated with significantly fewer deaths. Higher GDP
    per capita is associated with significantly fewer deaths. Higher cyclone propensity
    is associated with significantly fewer deaths. Higher Government expenditure is
    associated with significantly fewer deaths. The effect of various governance factors
    (political risk, military in politics, democracy etc.) is significant.
  30: Higher GDP values and life expectancy correlate with increased economic damages,
    while higher Gini index values correlate with decreased damages.
  31: The 'Magnitude' of tropical cyclones and 'Total GDP' are consistently significant
    positive drivers of economic damages across all model specifications. 'Area' and
    'GDPpc' have a negative and significant impact. 'Gini', 'Political risk', 'Socioeconomic
    Condition' and 'Credit/GDP' are also statistically significant determinants of
    economic damage, depending on the model specification.
  32: Presents a ranking of countries based on their efficiency in reducing disaster
    deaths from floods. Lists countries grouped by their index score range.
Methodology:
  3: No relevant information
  4: Empirical analysis using panel data. Focuses on tropical cyclones and floods.
  5: The paper aims to analyze the adaptation deficit through analytical and empirical
    investigation.
  6: The study uses econometric analysis with panel data on climate-related natural
    disasters and macroeconomic variables, comparing the relative impact of disasters
    on countries with differing levels of income and institutional quality. The analysis
    covers the period 1980-2008.
  7: The paper establishes a theoretical framework linking income and disaster loss
    to construct country efficiency rankings in disaster management.
  10: Empirical estimation of a theoretical equation using data from the Munich Re
    NatCat database. The analysis aggregates event data to the country-year level.
  11: OLS and negative binomial regressions are used to estimate the relationship
    between disaster damages/lives lost and factors explaining the unmitigated impact
    (I), controlling for these factors to infer adaptation effort. Equation (6) will
    be estimated separately for each hazard type.
  12: Regression analysis using explanatory variables to normalize event intensity
    and exposure, account for demand effects, and control for efficiency factors (institutional
    quality, income inequality, education, health, government expenditure, openness,
    financial sector development).
  13: Regression analysis with controls for intensity and exposure, demand effects,
    and efficiency spillovers. Uses lagged values for explanatory variables to address
    endogeneity.
  14: Regression analysis using disaster deaths as the dependent variable and various
    magnitude, population, demand, and efficiency variables as independent variables.
  15: Regression analysis relating disaster deaths to various political, economic,
    and social factors. The applicability of the results is limited to the countries
    and time period included in the original study.
  16: Regression analysis in log-log form; Elasticity estimation.
  17: Regression analysis to determine the relationship between various factors (Gini
    coefficient, political risk, etc.) and economic damages from floods and tropical
    cyclones. Country efficiency rankings are also considered.
  18: The analysis uses regression results to calculate an efficiency index based
    on factors statistically significant in predicting deaths per disaster. The rankings
    are country averages over the sample period.  The paper also mentions comparing
    the derived ranking for tropical cyclones with flood events, by calculating rank
    correlation.
  19: Stochastic frontier analysis was considered but deemed less appropriate for
    cross-country comparisons due to large variations in economic and social conditions
    and data limitations (lack of input cost data, proportion of zeros in casualty
    data).
  21: Regression analysis controlling for intensity of events and exposure; includes
    a time trend to capture trends in location behavior; experiments with urbanisation
    as a control variable
  22: Empirical analysis linking income and adaptation to past and future climate
    events.
  23: The analysis identifies countries where efficiency spill-overs from adaptation
    are weakest; The model controls for GDP or population size. Methodological and
    data problems prevent reliable identification of high-priority countries.
  28: Negative binomial regression is used to model the number of deaths from floods.
    The analysis considers data from multiple countries, and standard errors are clustered
    at the country level. Explanatory variables are logged and lagged one period (except
    Magnitude, Area, and Gini). The results are applicable to countries with similar
    characteristics and flood exposure.
  29: Negative binomial regression with country-clustered standard errors and lagged
    explanatory variables. The study uses data from 36-44 countries and up to 341
    observations. Variables are entered in logs (except Magnitude, Area and Gini).
  30: The analysis uses regression models with dependent variables being economic
    damages from floods, with explanatory variables entered in logs.
  31: Panel data regression analysis clustered at the country level. Explanatory variables
    (except Magnitude, Area and Gini) are lagged one period. Logarithmic transformations
    are applied to explanatory variables.
  32: The analysis calculates an efficiency index based on the number of deaths from
    floods (column 4 of Table 1, not provided). The index is normalized. A higher
    index indicates greater efficiency in reducing disaster deaths.
More Notes:
  3: The paper aims to understand the 'adaptation deficit', exploring why poor countries
    are disproportionately affected by climate change.
  4: The paper identifies countries with the largest adaptation inefficiencies and
    suggests inclusive growth policies and dedicated adaptation support targeted at
    countries with high adaptation inefficiencies.
  5: The paper suggests that addressing climate vulnerability might require both improving
    adaptation efficiency and promoting economic growth (though mindful of the potential
    for growth to increase climate sensitivity). The paper proposes income impacts
    climate security through both a demand and efficiency effect.
  6: The authors argue that the Munich Re NatCat database is superior to the EM-DAT
    database due to broader coverage and less bias. The study controls for disaster
    magnitude, which past studies often failed to do systematically.
  7: The paper uses data on natural disaster losses to identify adaptation capacity,
    building on earlier work by Tol and Yohe (2002; 2007).
  10: The figure illustrates a theoretical model of the 'adaptation deficit' but does
    not contain quantitative estimations. The study restricts its data to the period
    1980-2008 due to data quality and completeness.
  11: The study uses the Munich Re database for economic damage estimates, which is
    considered more reliable than EM-DAT. The paper postulates a relationship between
    adaptation effort and observed damages, using observed damages as an indicator
    of adaptation effort.
  12: The study uses data from Munich Re database and Neumayer et al. (2013).
  14: The time trend for deaths from flood events and tropical cyclones is negative,
    indicating that these have been reduced over time.
  15: The analysis focuses on disaster deaths, not direct macroeconomic or fiscal
    variables. However, disaster deaths can indirectly affect these variables.
  16: Government expenditure, credit/GDP and life expectancy are highly correlated
    with GDP per capita, which could explain some of the variation in results; The
    impact of propensity measures might be complex as people respond differently to
    the propensity of high versus low intensity events.
  17: The relationship between inequality and economic damages from floods is complex,
    potentially reflecting a bias in official figures that undercount economic losses
    suffered by poorer people.
  18: The paper acknowledges that general government expenditures may not fully capture
    dedicated disaster management spending. The study is focused on disaster impacts
    as measured by deaths and may not fully capture all relevant macroeconomic or
    fiscal outcomes.
  21: The paper acknowledges limitations in capturing the full intensity of events
    and the potential endogeneity of location decisions. Other climate-related disasters
    like droughts and heat waves are not included due to data limitations. Earthquakes
    are excluded due to the focus on climate-related adaptation.
  22: The paper argues that the 'adaptation deficit' (poor countries being more heavily
    affected) is due to a demand effect (increased demand for 'climate security' with
    income) and an efficiency effect (adaptation productivity is enhanced in high-income
    economies).
  23: Research on the link between economic growth and resilience to climate risk
    is patchy. The impact of income changes on the sensitivity of economies to climate
    events needs further analysis.
  28: While the table focuses on deaths, the factors influencing deaths (GDP, inequality,
    governance) are often also relevant for understanding macroeconomic and fiscal
    vulnerabilities to climate change. The coefficients are elasticities, representing
    the percentage change in deaths for a percentage change in the explanatory variable.
  29: The analysis focuses on the impact of various factors on the *number of deaths*
    from cyclones, which is used as a proxy for measuring the risks and benefits of
    adaptation. The study attempts to model risk and adaptation through 'demand' and
    'efficiency' factors, respectively.
  31: The dependent variable ('Economic Damages') units are not specified, nor is
    the exact definition. Socioeconomic Condition has a noteworthy impact.
  32: The page focuses solely on flood-related mortality and does not directly link
    this to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes. The 'efficiency' measure is specific
    to reducing deaths, not broader economic impacts. The index is based on the average
    values over the sample period (unspecified).

Quantitative material:
  3: No relevant information
  4: Uses panel data from the Munich Re natural catastrophe database.
  6: The Munich Re NatCat database contains more than 31,000 disaster entries, including
    17,500 unique entries with positive recorded loss, between 1980 and 2008. EM-DAT
    contains 8,105 natural disaster entries for the period 1980 to 2009, of which
    just 3,000 record a loss estimate.
  10: The NatCat database includes 31,000 individual entries (reduced to 20,000 for
    1980-2008); floods and tropical cyclones account for 33% of deaths and 43% of
    economic damages; analysis focuses on 2,277 country-year observations (1,779 floods,
    498 tropical cyclones).
  11: Observed damages (D) are used as a function of adaptation effort (A) and unmitigated
    impact (I), where D = f(A, I).
  14: A 10% rise in GDP per capita reduces fatalities from floods by around 1.4% at
    the median value of loss. A 10% rise in GDP per capita reduces median deaths from
    tropical cyclones by between 0.5 and 0.7%.
  15: No specific quantitative estimates of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, only
    relationships between variables and disaster deaths are described.
  16: A 10% rise in GDP per capita reduces economic damages from flood events by between
    3 and 5%, and from tropical cyclones by between 5 and 19%.
  17: The Gini coefficient has a negative relationship with economic damages from
    floods, but a positive relationship with economic losses from tropical cyclones.
    Higher credit/GDP and life expectancy are associated with higher economic losses.
    Greater trade openness reduces losses from cyclone events.
  18: Country efficiency rankings are calculated based on weighted sums of efficiency
    variables using coefficients from regressions (not detailed on this page).
  21: Magnitude variables are highly significant predictors of disaster losses
  22: A 10 per cent increase in income (GDP per capita) reduces the economic damages
    from climate disasters by between 3% and 5%, or perhaps as much as 19% in the
    case of cyclones.
  23: No relevant information
  28: The table provides regression coefficients and standard errors for the impact
    of various factors on the number of deaths caused by floods. For example, a 1%
    increase in flood magnitude is associated with a 0.32-0.45% increase in the number
    of deaths (depending on the model specification), all significant at the 1% level.
    A 1% increase in GDP per capita is associated with a ~0.65-0.69% decrease in the
    number of deaths.
  29: Regression coefficients and standard errors for various factors influencing
    the number of deaths due to tropical cyclones; significance levels (* p<0.10,
