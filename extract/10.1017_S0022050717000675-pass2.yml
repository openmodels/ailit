Drivers of Risk:
  2: Average temperature and rainfall
  4: The shocks impacting outcomes include climate change components such as temperature
    and precipitation changes.

  14: Long-term weather conditions such as temperature and precipitation impacts are
    analyzed.
  15: Long-term weather conditions, specifically annual mean temperature and annual
    accumulated precipitation, are the drivers impacting farm value.

Highlights:
  2: In the late 1800s, farm value per acre had an inverse U-shape relationship with
    average temperature. This negative effect of heat attenuated or reversed in recent
    decades, with farm value per acre increasing monotonically with average temperature
    in the second half of the twentieth century. A similar pattern is seen for rainfall.
  4: The production-function approach might overestimate agricultural damage without
    considering adaptation and substitution, as adaptive activities can mitigate negative
    impacts.
  8: County farm value has adapted to the permanent features of local weather over
    time in the United States.
  10: Relevance of temperature to farm value gradually changed across decades; negative
    association between temperature and farm value weakened throughout the early twentieth
    century, becoming marginally increasing in recent decades; Inverse U-shape relationship
    between precipitation and farm value observed until the early twentieth century,
    attenuating over time and county farm value increasing with precipitation levels
    in recent decades; Adaptation to hot and wet weather can be clearly observed across
    longer time periods, and the pattern of adaptation has occurred very gradually.
  11: "The effect of variation in long term temperature and rainfall on farm value\
    \ rapidly changed until the mid-twentieth century. High temperatures and rainfall\
    \ became more beneficial to farm value as time passed. \u0215t remains stable\
    \ after the period between 1960 and 1970."
  12: Adaptation to hot and rainy weather slowed in recent decades. County fixed effects
    models estimate smaller effects of weather on farm value relative to 1870 than
    year or state-by-year fixed effects models, suggesting that non-weather county
    characteristics correlated with weather conditions explain the observed patterns.
  13: The study notes that there has been a statistically significant cross-century
    change in the effect of weather on farm value.
  14: The table provides statistically significant coefficients showing the negative
    impact of certain temperature and precipitation changes on farm values across
    different time periods.
  15: "The interaction term (T-Tm) \xD7 (P-Pm) \xD7 D19 is statistically significant,\
    \ suggesting that the effect of temperature and precipitation on farm value differed\
    \ significantly between the 19th and 20th centuries."
  16: "The effect of temperature and precipitation on farm output value per acre changed\
    \ between the 19th and 20th centuries, as captured by the interaction terms (T\
    \ \xD7 D19 and P \xD7 D19).  The effect of the interaction term between temperature\
    \ and precipitation ((T-Tm) x (P-Pm)) is also estimated."
  17: Adaptation occurred more rapidly in hotter areas over time; Adaptation to precipitation
    was evident in wetter areas.
  18: Adaptation of farm output value to weather occurred more-or-less steadily across
    decades.
  19: Significant negative impacts of temperature and precipitation changes on farm
    value and output value are reported, showing the economic consequences of weather
    variability in agriculture.
  20: Adaptation in the relationship between annual temperature and farm output value
    is estimated more substantially for small-scale agricultural counties, suggesting
    that the adaptation to weather widely occurred across the broad scale of agriculture.
  21: Temperature and precipitation changes have statistically significant negative
    effects on farm value and output value. The results are robust to different specifications
    and controls.
  25: The study investigates the impact of early-life weather conditions on adult
    income by comparing cohorts born before 1900 and after 1930. The paper examines
    both short-term (weather fluctuations around the year of birth) and long-term
    (accumulated or lifetime effect of weather) impacts.
  26: Figure 4 summarizes regressions of cohort outcomes on early life weather conditions
    around the year of birth and occupational income in adulthood.
  29: Adaptation to weather effects occurred throughout early 20th century, impacting
    individual and agricultural productivity.
  30: "Adaptation in U.S. agriculture has substantially mitigated the adverse effects\
    \ of hotter and wetter weather over time. Today\u2019s relationships between weather/climate\
    \ and economic outcomes may be poor guides to the future because these relationships\
    \ have been unstable over historical time scales."
  34: Using county boundary-adjusted data does not cause critical problems in estimating
    fixed effects models.
  36: The effect of long-term temperature and precipitation on farm value is analyzed
    with and without county-boundary adjustments.
  37: Adaptation has occurred, with the magnitude of adaptation estimated as somewhat
    smaller when using a balanced panel of counties with no boundary changes compared
    to the baseline estimation.
Methodology:
  2: Analysis of U.S. historical data spanning about 140 years, using geospatial data
    on average weather conditions and historical weather information matched to economic
    variables at the county and state levels. Cross-sectional and panel/fixed effects
    models are discussed.
  4: The paper discusses the use of agronomic models of production functions and hedonic
    price models to analyze the impact of climate change on agriculture.
  7: Geostatistical technique called 'Kriging' is used to estimate weather variables
    for counties without historical weather stations.
  8: Cross-sectional analysis using scatter plots to investigate the historical relationships
    between county average farm value and weather conditions. Panel data analysis
    (unbalanced) to address potential biases from county boundary changes.
  9: The analysis uses farm statistics from historical census records and Kriging
    interpolated weather variables. Lowess fit curves and linear fit lines are used
    to model the relationship between farm value and weather variables.
  10: Bivariate cross-sectional analysis; Fixed effects model to complement the cross-sectional
    results; uses data for the 10 years prior to the year of census
  11: Weighted ordinary least squares regressions using Kriging process to calculate
    standard errors and inverse of standard errors as regression weights; county and
    state-by-year fixed effects
  12: Weighted regressions of the logarithm of county average farm value on 10-year
    average temperature/precipitation prior to each census year (1880-2000), standard
    controls, and interactions with census year dummies (reference year 1870). Fixed
    effects models (year, state-by-year, and county) are used.
  13: The analysis is conducted using weighted regressions of county farm value on
    decadal weather variables, accounting for state fixed effects, and controlling
    for interactions between control variables and a census year dummy.
  14: The analysis uses a difference-in-differences approach focusing on county farm
    value per acre with fixed effects for state, state-century, state-year, and county
    when including both temperature and precipitation.
  15: The study uses a regression analysis to estimate the century difference in the
    response of county farm value to long-term weather conditions. It compares decades
    ending in 1870-1900 with decades ending in 1970-2000. The regressions control
    for county population density, ratio of white populations, ratio of farmland to
    total county area, and number of farmers per farmland acre.
  16: The analysis uses panel data and regression analysis to estimate the relationship
    between short-term weather conditions (temperature and precipitation) and county
    average farm output value per acre. Models include various fixed effects (State,
    State x Century, State x Year, County). The sample covers the 19th and 20th centuries.
    Significance levels (*, **, ***) are provided for the coefficients.

    the relationship between county farm value and decadal weather variables, while
    panels C and D do so with county farm output value. Uses alternative weather variables
    and examines the influence of large-scale agricultural counties. Regression weights
    are applied. Controls for the ratio of farmland acres out of total county area.
    Counties are clustered into groups.
  20: Regression analysis controlling for weather variables and using different weighting
    schemes (ratio of farmland to total county area). Restrictions placed on the regression
    to counties with large-scale agriculture and those with small-scale agriculture.
  21: Regression analysis using county-level data from US agricultural censuses. The
    paper tests the sensitivity of the results to different measures of farm value
    and output, double-counting of corn and hay production, and discounting crop values.
  25: "The study uses data from the 1880 and 1900\u20131990 IPUMS datasets to analyze\
    \ native adult white males born between 1860 and 1960. The analysis examines the\
    \ relationship between weather conditions in early life (average temperature and\
    \ precipitation in the state of birth) and adult income. The study employs regression\
    \ analysis to determine how weather conditions around the time of birth affect\
    \ adult income."
  26: Regression analysis of cohort outcomes on early life weather conditions, controlling
    for state of birth, year of birth, and census year fixed effects. Data spans birth
    years 1860-1960, using U.S. censuses from 1880 and 1900-1990. Regression equation
    (3) models the relationship between occupational income and weather variables.
  29: Use of cross-sectional and fixed effects models to evaluate impacts of climate
    change on income.

    regressions.
  36: Regression analysis using county-level data from the US. Results are presented
    graphically in Figure 2. Standard errors are clustered. County fixed effects are
    included.
  37: Panel regressions are used to estimate the relationship between county farm
    value/output value and weather variables interacted with a dummy variable indicating
    census years in the nineteenth century. The analysis is performed using the full
    sample, a balanced panel of counties with no boundary changes from 1870 to 2000,
    and a sample of non-Southern counties. Standard errors are clustered on the county
    level.
More Notes:
  2: The United States is well-suited for this analysis due to sufficient weather
    variability across areas and the availability of conformable data on weather and
    economic variables over a long stretch of time.
  4: Adaptation and technological advancements can alter the response of crop yields
    to climate factors over time.
  7: The study uses data from 1870 to 2000 for farm value and farm output value, due
    to data quality concerns for earlier periods.
  8: The study's results do not specifically address the over-time instability of
    relationships outside the United States. The analysis uses data from 1880 to 2000,
    adjusting for county boundary changes.
  10: The hedonic approach does not determine whether adaptation resulted from a change
    in climate effect or changes in other agricultural, socioeconomic, or demographic
    characteristics.
  12: County boundary adjustments were made to the data in the panel fixed effects
    analysis.
  15: "The study acknowledges the potential endogeneity of policy and infrastructure\
    \ variables related to adaptation but chooses not to control for them, arguing\
    \ that these factors are part of the adaptation story. Weighted regressions are\
    \ used, where the regression weight is the inverse value of the weather estimates\u2019\
    \ standard errors."
  16: Standard errors are clustered on the county level.
  17: The paper explores the impact of weather variables (temperature and precipitation)
    on farm value and output, using historical data to infer adaptation. The analysis
    considers the interaction between temperature and precipitation.
  18: The magnitude of the adaptation to the weather is similar to what they estimated
    using farm value and long-term weather variables in a previous subsection.
  19: The paper uses inverse value of decadal, annual census estimation for the years
    listed in the tables, except in column (4), which uses the inverse value of the
    annual estimations.
  21: The analysis focuses on the impact of temperature and precipitation on farm
    productivity, using different measures to address potential biases. The standard
    errors of regression coefficients are clustered on county.
  26: The study focuses on native adult white males. The x-axis in Figure 4 represents
    the calendar year minus the year of birth, indicating the timing of weather fluctuations
    relative to birth. The model aims to capture the impact of early-life weather
    on later-life occupational income.
  32: The paper tests the validity of Kriging estimation for weather variables.
  34: The analysis is limited by the availability of controls. County-level IDUP output
    value data are missing for 1910-1930.
  37: The study examines the level of agricultural adaptation to weather. The dependent
    variables (farm value and farm output value) are measured at the county level,
    so the results are not directly national.
