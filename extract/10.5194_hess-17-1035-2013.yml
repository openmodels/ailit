  9: No relevant information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Decreases in glacier melt due to global warming; climate change projections impacting
    glacier and snow melt.
Highlights:
  1: Glacier melt is an important water source for central Chile in dry years. Predicted
    decreases in glacier melt due to global warming may have a negative long-term
    impact on water availability.
Methodology:
  1: Quantitative analysis of isotopic composition of streamflow and its sources to
    determine glacier melt and snowmelt contributions. Study conducted over one year
    in a high-altitude basin with moderate glacier cover (11.5%).
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on a specific Central Andean watershed and its water balance,
    using stable isotopes to determine contributions from snowmelt and glacier melt.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Potential negative long-term impact on water availability in the Central Andes,
    with economic implications for Chile's growing economic production.
Quantitative material:
  1: Glacier melt contribution to streamflow in the studied basin was 50-90% for the
    unusually dry melt year of 2011/2012.
