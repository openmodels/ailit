Drivers of Risk:
  1: Weather, climate, and interactions within the food system. Drought is specifically
    mentioned as a key word.
  2: Extreme weather and climate events, decreasing biodiversity, growing global population,
    demographic transitions, global shocks (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic, reduction of
    grain and fertilizer exports from Ukraine), energy system shocks, inflation.
  5: Changes in land use and climate affect the quantity and quality of water resources,
    impacting the local-to-regional patterns of climate variability.
  12: Droughts, heat waves, cascading climate-related events, poverty, rapid urbanization,
    weak governance, decline of ecosystems.
Highlights:
  1: Food security has not been a focus for the AMS community despite its importance
    and the clear roles for atmospheric and climate sciences. The AMS community is
    well-positioned to scale up its engagement across the global food system to address
    existing scientific needs and technology gaps to improve global food security.
  5: Matching models and information sources to the spatiotemporal requirements of
    specific decision processes is crucial for supporting food systems.
  12: Systemic risks associated with droughts can trigger cascading events and feedback
    loops, leading to food insecurity, social unrest, and impacting employment, prices,
    and trade. Unequal vulnerability disproportionately impacts the poor and marginalized.
Methodology:
  1: Expert panel discussions and literature review to identify intersections between
    food security and the American Meteorological Society (AMS).
  5: The analysis uses models that combine hydrometeorological, climatological, and
    agronomic data to support food-security monitoring across multiple time and space
    scales.
  12: Focuses on analyzing dynamics and frequency of compound events; foresight scenarios
    and early warnings will be increasingly important.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the role of the AMS community in addressing food security
    challenges related to weather and climate. It emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary
    collaboration and engagement with stakeholders and decision-makers.
  2: This page primarily discusses the relationship between climate change, extreme
    weather, and food security. While it doesn't directly provide quantitative data
    on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, it establishes food security as a critical
    vulnerability linked to climate-related risks, and it provides some specific historical
    examples of climate change related events which led to food insecurity. The specific
    nature of the impacts would likely need to be assessed in a national context.
  12: Many food systems are in a transitional phase relying less on natural systems
    and more on anthropogenic inputs. Need to analyze compound events, and the likelihood
    of simultaneous failures in different regions.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Food security, health and well-being, migration, national security, and global
    sustainable development. Food insecurity is mentioned as negatively impacting
    these.
  2: Food security, measured by availability, access, utilization, and stability of
    food.
  12: Food price spikes, food insecurity, famine, impacts on employment rates, food
    prices, international trade.
