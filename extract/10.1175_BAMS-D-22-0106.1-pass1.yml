  2: Extreme weather and climate events such as cold snaps and hurricanes.
  3: Droughts, floods, heat waves, cold spells, and storm events impacting food production,
    distribution, and consumption.

    food security. The economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and conflict
    are also mentioned as contributing factors.
  14: Climate change impacts like increased human-induced emissions and low predictability
    of precipitation threaten food security, especially for vulnerable communities.
Evaluation overview:
  1: "Food security is a key pillar of environmental security, yet remains one of\
    \ the world\u2019s greatest challenges. Food insecurity negatively impacts health\
    \ and well-being, drives mass migration, and undermines national security and\
    \ global sustainable development."

    insecurity.
  11: Food security applications.
  12: The page evaluates the impacts of droughts, heat waves, and other climate-related
    events on food security, agricultural production, infrastructure, and human health.
  13: Food security is the primary outcome being evaluated, particularly in the context
    of vulnerable communities and sustainable development goals.
  14: This page discusses global food security's vulnerability to climate change and
    the need for effective weather and climate observation, forecasting, and communication
    to prevent adverse impacts on food security.
Highlights:
  1: Food security has not been a focus for the AMS community, despite its importance
    and clear roles for the atmospheric and climate sciences.
  2: Emphasizes the vulnerability of the U.S food system to climate change, with examples
    like Texas's cold snap and Hurricane Ian increasing food insecurity.
  3: "Climate change acts as a \"threat multiplier\" for food-insecure communities,\
    \ threatening crop yields, raising prices, and reducing growers\u2019 incomes."
  5: Atmospheric evaporative demand is presented as a crucial link between plant physiology,
    water stress/availability, and atmospheric conditions, making it central to food-security
    monitoring. It is sometimes forecast with equal or better skill than precipitation.
  6: Agricultural decisions are shaped by corresponding meteorological phenomena across
    interacting spatiotemporal scales, from plant-to-field scales, irrigation and
    plant breeding show adaptation to climate changes.
  7: Actionable information for food security can be derived from monitoring climate
    and understanding climatological characteristics even with low forecast skill
    at longer lead times. Predictability is higher when slowly varying modes of climate
    variability (e.g., ENSO) are present. Prediction skill can leverage specific climate
    phenomena not captured in climate change projections. Converting data into actionable
    wisdom requires a robust forecasting infrastructure.
  8: FEWS NET successfully combines climate forecasts and Earth system monitoring
    to anticipate and mitigate food insecurity impacts.
  9: Highlights the importance of communication and collaboration between researchers
    and decision-makers (O2R and R2O) in climate-related research and application,
    emphasizing the limitations of unidirectional approaches. It also points out the
    value of prototypes and testbeds in supporting effective communication and knowledge
    transfer.
  10: The paper highlights the potential of extending testbeds to facilitate expertise
    transfer between researchers and humanitarian decision-makers, especially during
    extreme events. It emphasizes the need for operational decision-support products,
    their verification, and data accessibility, particularly within the food-security
    space. The paper stresses the importance of two-way knowledge transfer to ensure
    the sustainability of humanitarian efforts and build the capacity of partners,
    especially in lower-income countries.
  11: Meteorological and climate impacts can be modeled and attributed for food security
    applications using a combination of models and datasets, with the AMS playing
    a crucial role.
  12: Droughts can act as triggers for cascading events and feedback loops, leading
    to ripple effects such as food spikes and social unrest. Climate extremes can
    affect large areas for several years, impacting even those distant from the initial
    event. Societal vulnerability is unequal, with disproportionate impacts on the
    poor and marginalized, leading to price volatility, food insecurity, and conflict.
  13: Early warning systems and forecast-based financing are highlighted as effective
    approaches to save lives and livelihoods, reduce losses and damages, and enhance
    food security in the face of climate-related risks. Improving early warning of
    extreme events that have the potential to impact food security can strengthen
    humanitarian response and sustainable development.
  14: Emphasizes the necessity of improving collaboration between scientists, policymakers,
    and other stakeholders to enhance global food security against climate change
    impacts.
Methodology:

    Session at the AMS 2022 Annual Meeting, and identifies overlapping issues and
    key points of intersection between the food-security community and AMS.
  3: Discussion based on expertise shared by the American Meteorological Society (AMS)
    Presidential Forum panel members and others with experience at the interface of
    food security and climate, including monitoring and forecasting weather and climate
    phenomena.
  5: The page discusses the use of various models including water-stress models, agricultural
    water demand models, crop water requirements models, genetic-by-environment models,
    and comprehensive crop, livestock, and socio-economic models. It also mentions
    the importance of considering different time and space scales, from plant to global
    scales and nowcasts to multidecadal predictions.
  6: No relevant information
  8: FEWS NET integrates physical and socioeconomic data, with significant emphasis
    on stakeholder engagement, to inform food security decision-making.
  9: This paper discusses the importance of 'coproduction' involving dialogue between
    researchers and users/decision-makers to address challenges in climate research
    and application. It highlights the need for knowledge exchange and effective communication
    before, during, and after extreme events to foster understanding and collaboratively
    derive knowledge. Prototypes and testbeds are introduced as important tools to
    support effective communication and knowledge transfer.
  10: The paper proposes a cyclical or iterative prototype framework for jointly advancing
    O2R (Operations to Research) and R2O (Research to Operations), inspired by Agile
    project management principles. This framework emphasizes collaboration between
    researchers and practitioners through testbeds, where joint learning and knowledge
    transfer are the goals. The process includes defining user requirements, planning
    and designing a new product, executing the plan, verification through traditional
    methods and decision-based assessments, and user verification through testbed
    trials.
  11: Utilizes models (weather, climate, agricultural), attribution studies that use
    combinations of crop models, land surface schemes, hydrological parameterizations,
    data-driven models, and historical bias-adjusted climate datasets.
  13: The page discusses forecast-based financing (FbF) as a methodology for anticipating
    and mitigating the impacts of drought on food systems, using tailored climate
    forecasts and vulnerability analyses to trigger early actions. It is applicable
    to slow-onset droughts, offering a longer timeframe for resilience and adaptation
    measures.
