Drivers of Risk:
  8: Climate change and associated spatial planning co-occur, but detailed, long-term
    climate change action plans for aquaculture were not apparent.
  13: Trends in seafood consumption and production (wild capture and aquaculture),
    including changes in human population, demand in other parts of the world, and
    socio-political changes. Proposed aquaculture growth targets.
Highlights:
  8: ICES countries have established comparatively conservative targets for increasing
    aquaculture production, and long-term climate change action plans for aquaculture
    were not apparent, indicating a need for further planning.
  13: The study projects domestic seafood deficits or surpluses for ICES nations by
    2050 based on production targets. The trends in the percent of total global consumption
    and production of seafood from ICES nations are decreasing due to increasing human
    population and greater demand in other parts of the world.
Methodology:
  13: Analysis based on FAO data (2013, 2018a). An exponential model is fit to aquaculture
    and wild capture trends with 95% confidence intervals. Domestic seafood deficit
    calculated by consumption minus combined (fisheries and aquaculture) production
    based on reported targets.
More Notes:
  8: The paper assesses aquaculture production goals of ICES member countries and
    their relationship to climate change planning.
  13: The analysis focuses on ICES nations and their seafood production and consumption.
    The inclusion of Chinese aquaculture is for reference of production scale.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  8: Consumption demand and associated tradeoffs for aquaculture production.
  13: Domestic seafood deficit in millions of tonnes over time, calculated by consumption
    minus combined (fisheries and aquaculture) production based on reported targets.
Quantitative material:
  8: Most countries have comparatively conservative targets (median magnitude = 2)
    for increasing aquaculture production.
  13: Past and future trends of ICES aquaculture and wild capture (tons). Current
    (2013) and future (2050) total consumption levels (tons). Domestic seafood deficit/surplus
    in millions of tonnes over time (non-consecutive years). Percentage change in
    production between subsequent years. Probability the change is positive in a given
    year across all ICES countries.
