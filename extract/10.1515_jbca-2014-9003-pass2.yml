  17: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme climatic events; Ecosystem effects.
  2: The paper identifies the impacts of a changing climate on the US economy and
    the potential role of adaptation actions.
  6: Climate change
  10: Changes in temperature and rainfall; GHG emissions scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP
    8.5); Absent carbon fertilization.
  11: Climate change, storm surge, changes in sea level, GHG emissions
  12: High emissions scenario RCP 8.5; Climate change impacts on sectors like transportation,
    coastal resources, energy, labor, and ecosystems (reefs, fire response).
  13: Climate change impacts on crop growth (temperature, precipitation changes),
    changes in CO2 levels (carbon fertilization), changes in ozone levels, water resource
    availability (irrigation demand and supply), sea level rise.
  14: Sea level rise and storm surge.
  15: Sea level rise (including dynamic ice sheet melting), changes in hurricane activity,
    droughts, and flooding. Underestimation of risk leading to an adaptation deficit.
  16: Climate-induced changes in hydrologic variables, hydro-climatic metrics, and
    water management practices.
  17: Climate change impacts on water resources (irrigated agriculture, energy cooling,
    aquatic ecosystems), roads, bridges, and urban drainage.
  18: Vulnerable infrastructure from the capital stock and a stressor-response relationship
    to estimate impacts of climate change.
  21: Rising temperatures leading to changes in heating and cooling degree-days (HDD/CDDs)
  22: Temperature increases impacting energy demand and labor productivity.
  23: Changes in sea-surface temperature affecting coral coverage; Climate change
    leading to increased wildfire risk; Climate change affecting cold-water and warm-water
    fishing opportunities.
  24: Gradual changes in temperature and precipitation; extreme events (storm surge,
    wildfire events, seasonal floods, high rainfall events).
  27: Climate-driven changes.
  28: Climate change impacts, including premature mortality and potentially changes
    in water availability and cooling water intake temperature.
Highlights:
  1: Highlights gaps in comprehensive sectoral coverage, incorporation of adaptation
    opportunities in impact assessment, and understanding of cross- and multi-sectoral
    effects.
  6: Graphical framework for optimizing the balance between economic impacts of climate
    change, the cost of adaptation, and the residual impacts; Distinguishes between
    scenarios where full adaptation is possible and not possible; Identifies limits
    of adaptation due to technology, economics, and information.
  9: Econometric approaches rely on real-world data, while simulation approaches can
    trace costs and benefits of adaptation strategies. Some impacts, like the loss
    of charismatic species, are difficult to estimate, leading to limited literature
    on their value.
  10: Risky Business initiative finds that climate change will have negative impacts
    on the yields of major US crops, particularly under higher emissions scenarios.
  11: Annual storm surge damages could range from $42 to $108 billion. Overall economic
    impacts vary significantly across time horizons, with substantial potential costs
    by 2100.
  12: Significant potential economic impacts across various sectors, with estimated
    ranges of costs/benefits depending on time period and scenario (business as usual
    vs. adaptation).
  13: The economic impacts of climate change on US agriculture, while notable, are
    relatively modest in the context of the overall US economy. The impact of carbon
    fertilization is an important factor and may be overestimated in current models.
    Integrating water resource availability for irrigation is a key issue that has
    not yet been fully addressed in US analyses.
  14: Adaptation is very cost-effective, reducing impacts from over $4 trillion to
    $990 billion.
  16: GHG mitigation can significantly reduce negative impacts and improve economic
    welfare; extreme weather events like flooding are expected to increase due to
    climate change.
  17: Changes in infrastructure capacities and operating rules may constitute an important
    source of adaptive capacity that has not been fully explored in economic analyses.
    Roads and bridges may be particularly vulnerable to climate change.
  18: Most effects to bridges occurring before 2050, and most effects for roads occurring
    after 2050. Mitigation policy is effective in reducing these impacts (by $85 billion
    discounted).
  21: Rising temperatures will increase electricity demands for cooling and decrease
    demand for heating; Electricity demand across the country is projected to increase,
    leading to increased power system costs.
  22: Temperature increases are projected to substantially increase energy expenditures.
    Labor productivity may increase or decrease in the near term, but is projected
    to increase substantially in the later parts of the century.
  23: Hawaii has the greatest recreational benefits (reduced damages under the mitigation
    scenario) for coral reefs; Climate change has the potential to substantially increase
    wildfire risk; Climate change is projected to initially increase, then decrease
    recreational fishing days, with the net present value of benefits of a mitigation
    policy needing to account for the relative values of cold-water versus warm-water
    fishing.
  24: The quality and comprehensiveness of economic estimates of climate change impacts
    in the US is increasing, but much work remains. Impact assessments must focus
    more attention on extreme events.
  27: Macroeconomic effects captured in RHG-MUSE reduce the overall cost of direct
    climate impacts.
  28: Climate change could lead to direct costs of 0.8-3.5% of GDP and macroeconomically
    processed costs of 0.8-1.9% of GDP nationwide under RCP 8.5 in the late century.
    The RHG-MUSE model is flexible and can be updated.
Methodology:
  1: Review of literature on impacts and adaptation costs at the sectoral level, primarily
    in the US, but with international examples. Focus on methodologies used in impact
    studies.
  6: Benefit-cost framework balancing climate impacts with the costs and benefits
    of adaptations.
  8: The CIRA effort emphasizes simulation modeling of impacts, while the Risky Business
    Project emphasizes econometric estimates.
  9: 'The paper discusses two main methodologies: econometric approaches (Ricardian
    studies and correlational approaches) and simulation approaches. Econometric approaches
    use historical data to infer the effects of climate across space or time. Simulation
    approaches trace costs and benefits of adaptation strategies through mechanisms
    of interest.'
  10: CIRA employs a simulation approach. Risky Business employs econometric analysis
    linked to an input-output model. Risky Business uses econometric techniques to
    isolate the effect of temperature and rainfall on crop yields, and a similar approach
    to measure rates of agricultural adaptation. An input-output approach based on
    the IMPLAN model is used to value crop yield effects.
  11: CIRA estimates are used, reflecting the effects of sea level rise and other
    risks, with discount rates of 3% used for some calculations. The analysis incorporates
    climate change impact studies and site-specific adaptation scenarios. A business-as-usual
    (BAU) scenario is used. The methodology incorporates econometrics and simulation.
  12: Uses CIRA (Climate Impact Research and Analysis) estimates. Includes risklogic
    and discount rates. Reports 95% confidence intervals for fire response and reefs.
  13: National-scale modeling of climate change impacts on agricultural yields under
    the RCP 8.5 scenario.
  15: Economic models are used to analyze sea level rise impacts, dependent on scenarios
    of sea level rise. The models consider or exclude dynamic ice sheet melting from
    Greenland and West Antarctica.
  16: Analysis conducted using five existing, peer-reviewed models focusing on hydrologic
    variables, hydro-climatic metrics, flood damages, and economic welfare.
  17: Simulation modeling approaches are used to assess infrastructure impacts and
    adaptation benefits. Econometric approaches are used in some cases (e.g., CIRA
    flooding analysis). Some models rely on rules of thumb for stressor-response relationships
    (e.g., Larsen et al., 2008).
  18: Identify vulnerable infrastructure from the capital stock, develop a stressor-response
    relationship to estimate impacts, and identify and apply cost-effective adaptation
    measures to reflect the net results of reasonable adaptation responses to stressors.
  21: "Three simulation approaches are used: Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM-USA),\
    \ Regional Electricity Deployment System Model (ReEDS), and Integrated Planning\
    \ Model (IPM\xAE). Models forecast changes in electricity demand as a function\
    \ of changes in heating and cooling degree-days (HDD/CDDs)."
  22: The study estimates changes in energy demand using econometrically derived estimates
    of percentage change in energy expenditures. Labor productivity impacts are estimated
    using impact functions for individuals in high- and low-risk industries, and are
    valued using 2011 IMPLAN input-output tables by geographic area.
  23: Translates changes in sea-surface temperature to estimates of coral coverage,
    then values the losses using willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates for recreational
    use of reefs; Quantifies and monetizes projected impacts on terrestrial ecosystem
    carbon storage and areas burned by wildfires, using the MC1 dynamic global vegetation
    model; Assesses freshwater recreational fishing, considering negative effects
    on cold-water fishing and positive effects on warm-water fishing, then values
    these changes.
  24: Review of existing economic estimates of climate change impacts in the US.
  27: A macroeconomic model of the US economy (RHG-MUSE) that processes direct costs
    and benefits and incorporates adjustments in prices, capital stock, and labor
    supply.
  28: Uses the RHG-MUSE model. Direct cost and benefit inputs can be updated.
More Notes:
  1: "Motivated by U.S. EPA\u2019s ongoing Climate Impacts and Risk Analysis (CIRA)\
    \ project; the new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR5 Working\
    \ Group II report; the U.S. National Climate Assessment; and the Risky Business\
    \ Project."
  2: The paper emphasizes limited availability of economic cost estimates and the
    role of adaptation, along with recent efforts by U.S. EPA's CIRA program and the
    Risky Business Project to assess economic impacts.
  8: The paper distinguishes between adaptation planning and mitigation planning,
    highlighting the different tradeoffs involved. It also notes that sectoral economic
    impact analyses should ideally provide estimates for scenarios with and without
    cost-effective adaptation.
  10: CIRA incorporates adaptation at both the farm and market levels. Risky Business
    incorporates an estimate of carbon fertilization.
  11: The page mentions different models and their respective outputs, indicating
    some uncertainty or a range of possible economic impacts.
  12: The page contains snippets of information, seemingly from a table. The abbreviations
    and formatting are inconsistent, making precise interpretation challenging. Focuses
    on monetary quantification of risks and adaptation benefits, seemingly spanning
    various sectors.
  14: The $990 billion and $4 trillion figures are based on the CIRA model.
  15: The analysis focuses on quantifying coastal property value at risk of loss,
    rather than impacts net of adaptation. Social vulnerability and ecosystem effects
    are not adequately addressed in the coastal impacts literature.
  17: The intersectoral nature of water resources is important. The lack of econometric
    models for estimating water resource effects is noted, except that the CIRA flooding
    analysis does employ an econometric approach.
  18: Infrastructure analyses should incorporate more realistic learning and baseline
    road maintenance norms, address knock-on secondary damages associated with productivity
    losses following infrastructure failure, and address extreme events. Econometric
    approaches could relate spatial differences in temperature and precipitation regimes
    with construction costs and/or specifications.
  21: The analysis focuses on the effects of climate change on electricity demand
    and its impact on power system costs; The study does not directly analyze GDP
    effects, productivity loss, interest, inflation, budget balance, borrowing costs,
    public expenditure or revenue; it focuses on the energy sector.
  24: Quantified economic benefits are solely associated with recreational uses and
    are a subset of total benefits.
  27: The analysis focuses on direct effects of climate change on economic assets
    or production, while indirect effects like business interruption and long-term
    capital losses are largely ignored.
  28: Intersectoral effects, such as water-energy nexus, are important but currently
    omitted. The paper suggests incorporating changes in water availability as a constraint
    on irrigated agricultural production and considering cooling water intake temperature
    and supply volumes as a potential constraint on electric power production capacity.

  16: Estimated changes in economic welfare due to climate change impacts and mitigation
    efforts, $0.5 billion annual increase by 2050, decreasing to $6.5 billion annual
    decrease by 2100; potential $15-$100 billion annual decrease by 2100 for alternative
    climate models.
  18: Cumulative impacts (discounted at 3%) total about $260 billion, with $160 billion
    from bridges, and $80 billion from roads, and $20 billion from urban drainage.
  21: Change in power system costs due to increased electricity demand

    costs, and coastal property loss.
  28: "Direct costs of 0.8\u20133.5% of GDP nationwide, and a macroeconomically processed\
    \ effect of 0.8\u20131.9% of GDP nationwide, under RCP 8.5, late-century."
Quantitative material:
  10: Under RCP 4.5, Risky Business finds median yield penalty of 0.6% in 2020-2039,
    0.9% by mid-century, and 3.4% by end century. Under RCP 8.5, the yield penalty
    increases to 15.3% by end century. Absent carbon fertilization under RCP 4.5,
    median yield penalty increases to 4.1%, 8.4%, and 14.4% for the three 21st-century
    projection periods.
  11: "Economic costs range from $42 to $108 billion annually due to storm surge.\
    \ Risk estimates for various periods: 2020 to 2039: \u2013$2.5 to $3.5 billion;\
    \ 2040 to 2059: \u2013$3.6 to $7.8 billion; 2050: $66 billion; 2100: $238 billion,\
    \ with 5% channel discount rate. Other estimates exist from other models. One\
    \ model suggests -$0.5 to $2.5 billion in 2050 and $6.5 to over $100 billion in\
    \ 2100."
  12: "Economic risk 2020-2039: Transportation sector sees costs between \u2013$0.5\
    \ to +$22 billion. Coastal resources: $1.7 to $5.2 billion. Energy Labor Sector:\
    \ $8 to $30 billion. Ecosystems (reefs) $18 billion. Fire Response $7.3 to $9.2\
    \ billion."
  13: "Change in yields for the RCP 8.5 scenario range from an average annual direct\
    \ cost of \u2013$2.5 billion (i.e., a $2.5 billion benefit) to $3.5 billion by\
    \ 2020\u20132039; \u2013$3.6 to +$7.8 billion by 2040\u20132059, and \u2013$3.9\
    \ to +$24 to billion by 2080\u20132099."
  14: Business-as-usual scenario results in $990 billion in cumulative impacts through
    2100 (2005$ discounted at 3% to 2015), net of cost-effective adaptation. Mitigating
    GHGs is estimated to only reduce those impacts by $84-$100 billion. With no adaptation,
    cumulative impacts through 2100 are over $4 trillion (discounted).
  15: Sea level rise could cause $42 billion in damage annually, and changes in hurricane
    activity could increase this to $108 billion annually.
  16: Welfare increase of $0.5 billion per year by 2050; welfare decrease of $6.5
    billion per year by 2100; decreases from $15 billion to $100 billion per year
    by 2100 for different climate models; potential gains from GHG mitigation of $3.3
    billion in 2050 and $9.4 billion by 2100, increasing to $84 billion annual benefit
    for alternative models.
  18: Cumulative impacts (discounted at 3%) total about $260 billion, with $160 billion
    from bridges, and $80 billion from roads, and $20 billion from urban drainage.
    Mitigation policy is effective in reducing these impacts (by $85 billion discounted),
    having a somewhat greater effect for roads than for bridges.
  21: "Electricity demand is projected to increase by 1.5\u20136.5% by 2050 compared\
    \ to a control scenario with today\u2019s climate; Power system costs are projected\
    \ to increase by 1.7\u20138.3% (cumulative costs discounted at 3% from 2015 to\
    \ 2050)."
  22: "Under RCP 8.5, average annual energy expenditure increases by $0.5 to $12 billion\
    \ (2020-2039), $8 to $30 billion (2040-2059), and $33 to $89 billion (2080-2099).\
    \ Average annual direct labor productivity costs (high and low risk combined)\
    \ under RCP 8.5 are -$0.5 billion to +$22 billion (2020-2039), +$11 to +$53 billion\
    \ (2040-2059), and +$45 to +$156 billion (2080-2099).  High-risk labor supply\
    \ declines by 0.22\u20130.86% by mid-century and by 0.81\u20132.3% by late-century\
    \ under RCP 8.5."
  23: "Hawaii: recreational benefits of mitigation policy, average NPV (3% discount\
    \ rate) of ~$17 billion (95% CI of $9\u201326 billion); Florida: recreational\
    \ benefits of mitigation policy, average NPV (3% discount rate) of ~$1.3 billion\
    \ (95% CI of $0.7\u20132.0 billion); Puerto Rico: recreational benefits of mitigation\
    \ policy, average NPV (3% discount rate) of ~$0.4 million (95% CI of $0.2\u2013\
    0.5 million); Cumulative reductions of 122 million hectares burned between 2011\
    \ and 2100, implying avoided cumulative fire response costs of $9.2 billion (discounted);\
    \ alternative climate models show smaller benefits, of 84\u201391 million burned\
    \ hectares avoided and an associated cost reduction of $7.3\u2013$7.8 billion,\
    \ as summarized in Table 1; Net recreational fishing days projected to increase\
    \ from 2011 to 2050 by approximately 1,500,000 days, but then decline in 2100\
    \ to approximately the same level as 2000."
  24: Cold-water fishing economic value declines from ~$1 billion to ~$300 million
    when gains in other fishing types are considered.
  28: "Direct costs of 0.8\u20133.5% of GDP nationwide; macroeconomically processed\
