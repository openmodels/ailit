  8: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  4: Climate change risks and the COVID-19 pandemic are key drivers, considered as
    an 'inflexion point'.
  5: PESTEL drivers of change were identified, including economic, environmental,
    political, social, technological, and legal factors.
Highlights:
  8: Regulatory policies, incentives, and disincentives were categorized as tools
    for addressing climate change, including regulations on land use, biodiversity
    protection, and the extractive industry, as well as incentives for sustainable
    practices and disincentives for polluting activities.
  10: The paper aims to identify general actions applicable across Latin American
    and Caribbean countries to achieve desired sustainable and regenerative futures.
    It highlights the need for cooperation at national and international levels, while
    acknowledging the importance of addressing differences and particularities at
    subnational levels.
Methodology:
  4: Qualitative futures study using scenario planning with a multi-stakeholder approach
    (government, private sector, civil society, academia) to identify how Latin American
    and Caribbean countries can build long-term resilience, focusing on adaptiveness
    to climate change risks considering existing sustainable development challenges
    and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
  5: The study uses multi-stakeholder focus groups (workshops) in each country. Participants
    brainstormed best and worst scenarios, validated pre-defined PESTEL drivers, created
    narratives for future scenarios in a 2x2 matrix (socio-economic prosperity vs.
    resilience to climate change), brainstormed critical actions, and provided policy
    recommendations in another 2x2 matrix. Data was collected via Zoom/MS Teams and
    Miro, using video and audio recordings, transcripts, and notes taken by the national
    research teams.
  8: Futures methodology workshops were implemented in seven different countries,
    and the transcripts and written data were coded using Atlas.ti and MS Excel spreadsheets.
    A priori, 309 codes were used, ranging from actors, drivers of change, structural
    changes, limitations and risks to goals and opportunities for action. National
    coding added up to 413 codes.
  10: The paper uses scenario planning, creating four scenarios based on climate change
    resilience and socio-economic recovery. Research participants created narratives
    for these scenarios and identified characteristics and drivers, leading to the
    identification of over 50 action opportunities for various sectors.
More Notes:
  10: The paper acknowledges a gap regarding the differences and particularities in
    desired outcomes and contexts between LAC countries and within them at subnational
    levels, which may limit the applicability of a one-size-fits-all approach.
Quantitative material:
  5: 'The 28 country-based focus groups identified 334 drivers of change: 71 economic,
    60 environmental, 59 political, 59 social, 54 technological and 41 legal.'
