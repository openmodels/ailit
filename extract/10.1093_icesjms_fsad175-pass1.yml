  6: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate shocks such as marine heatwaves, harmful algal blooms, low oxygen events,
    and hurricanes.
  2: Climate shocks such as droughts and marine heatwaves impact terrestrial and marine
    food production systems.
  3: Climate change shocks such as heatwaves, natural disasters, and storms.
  4: Marine climate shocks (harmful algal blooms, marine heatwaves, hurricanes), climate
    change (increased frequency of intense hurricanes).
  5: "Harmful algal blooms driven by anomalously warm ocean conditions, linked to\
    \ strong El Ni\xF1o conditions and the positive phase of the Southern Annular\
    \ Mode."
  6: Climate shocks impacting fisheries and aquaculture production (e.g., marine heatwaves,
    changes in ocean properties like temperature, oxygen levels, and nutrient availability).
    Overcapitalization and poor management of fisheries.
  8: Marine climate shocks and long-term climate change impact blue food industries.
  9: Extreme marine climate events, marine heatwaves, harmful algal blooms, non-linear
    changes in productivity of fisheries or aquaculture, shifting marine species ranges.
Highlights:
  1: Climate shocks pose an existential threat to the Blue Foods economy, leading
    to reduced growth, coral bleaching, poor productivity, increased disease risk,
    and fish kills.
  2: Climate shocks threaten the maintenance of blue food supply chains and associated
    food and income security.
  4: Climate shocks are causing significant economic losses in fisheries, and government
    disaster relief is often delayed and insufficient.
  5: Harmful algal blooms caused significant economic losses in Chilean aquaculture,
    specifically an export loss of around $800 million USD, and led to social unrest.
  6: Moral hazard and adverse selection are significant challenges for insurance schemes
    in fisheries and aquaculture.  Insurance can exacerbate ecosystem degradation
    if applied to poorly managed fisheries.
  8: Insurance and government policies play a crucial role in providing resilience
    against marine climate shocks to blue food supply chains and coastal communities.
  9: Insurance can help actors conserve capital reserves during climate shocks, bolster
    adaptive capacity, and transition to new locations or sources of income. Rising
    insurance costs can signal the need for alternative risk management measures.
    Insurance can provide economic resilience in the near term, combined with support
    mechanisms for long-term planning. Parametric insurance could take the role of
    disaster relief for mitigating the impacts of climate change.
Methodology:
  3: Risk is transferred from individuals or companies to insurers and then potentially
    reinsurers. Insurance and reinsurance are used to pool risk and provide financial
    compensation after a loss event. Parametric insurance compensates based on a pre-defined
    payout when a trigger is met.
More Notes:
  1: The paper argues for the use of insurance and financial risk management tools
    to bolster the resilience of blue food supply chains and coastal communities.
  2: Insurance is highlighted as a mechanism for managing financial risks related
    to climate shocks in blue food sectors, although there are challenges related
    to moral hazard, adverse selection, and risk pricing.
  3: The text discusses various types of insurance (e.g., facultative, treaty), adverse
    selection, moral hazard, resilience, vulnerability, and adaptation, but these
    are largely definitions and conceptual discussions with no specific quantifiable
    outcomes.
  4: The paper suggests that insurance tools could offer an improvement to government
    disaster relief for mitigating the impacts of marine climate shocks.
  5: The paper highlights the challenges of insuring common pool resources and the
    aquaculture industry due to factors like lack of data, difficulty in verifying
    stock levels, and the novelty of large-scale aquaculture.
  6: The paper discusses the difficulties in attributing revenue losses in fisheries
    to specific climate shocks due to open ocean boundaries, animal migration, and
    multiple stressors.  Verifying truthful losses for insurance claims is costly.
    Insurance is more viable in sustainably managed fisheries.
  9: Government subsidies and support from non-traditional sources such as NGOs could
    play a role in ensuring the viability of insurance contracts. Reinsurance is crucial
    for managing correlated marine climate shocks over large spatial scales.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Reduced profits for blue food producers.
  3: Economic losses due to climate-related events are reduced through insurance and
    reinsurance mechanisms.
  4: Economic losses in blue-food sectors, government disaster relief costs, impact
    on fishing revenue and livelihoods, cost of inaction.
  5: Export loss of ~$US$800 million in Chile due to harmful algal blooms affecting
    salmon aquaculture.
  9: Reduced financial loss for resource users, improved livelihoods, and improved
    environmental sustainability.
Quantitative material:
  4: "California Dungeness crab landings for the 2015\u201316 season reached only\
    \ 52% of the average catch of the previous 5 years, with a total value lost estimated\
    \ at US$97.5 million. Federal disaster relief funding was $27.3 million. Hurricane\
    \ Maria caused commercial landings in Puerto Rico to fall by 20%, with economic\
    \ losses estimated at US$17.8 million. FEMA announced it would provide US$1.8\
    \ million in grants to fishers in Puerto Rico."
  5: Export loss of ~$US$800 million in Chile.
