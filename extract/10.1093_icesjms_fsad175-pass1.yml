Drivers of Risk:
  1: Species range shifts, harmful algal blooms, marine heatwaves, low oxygen events,
    coral bleaching, and hurricanes.
  4: Harmful algal bloom driven by a multi-year marine heatwave ('the Blob'). Hurricane
    Maria.
  5: "Environmental risks impacting outcomes include harmful algal blooms, disease\
    \ outbreaks, changes in water quality, extreme weather events, and marine climate\
    \ shocks like El Ni\xF1o."
  6: Climate shocks affecting fisheries and aquaculture include temperature changes
    in ocean properties, ocean connectivity, ecosystem health, and overcapitalization.
  7: Climate shocks impacting fisheries and aquaculture production, prolonged sea
    surface temperatures, storms, ocean temperature, oxygen levels, disease risk.
  8: Marine climate shocks, marine heatwaves causing coral bleaching, cyclones, and
    long-term climate change are impacting the economic resilience of coastal communities.
  9: Magnitude and frequency of certain climate shocks (e.g. marine heatwaves); frequency
    of harmful algal blooms driven by marine heatwaves; slight increase in the frequency
    or intensity of a marine climate shock
  10: The paper mentions marine heatwaves, hypoxic events, and harmful algal blooms
    as climate shocks impacting marine resource users.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Economic risk to fisheries and aquaculture due to climate shocks.
  4: Economic losses engendered by marine climate shocks.
  5: This page provides an overview of resilience and insurance challenges in fisheries
    and aquaculture, including impacts on economic losses and global supply disruption.
  6: The paper explores the challenges of attributing direct revenue losses in marine
    systems to specific climate shocks.
  7: Discusses the effectiveness of different insurance types (indemnity, parametric)
    in mitigating the impacts of climate shocks on blue food production (fisheries
    and aquaculture).
  8: This paper evaluates the economic resilience of coastal communities and blue
    food industries to marine climate shocks.
  9: Improve the sustainability of the environment and the resource users; reduce
    financial loss for resource users, such that both livelihoods and environmental
    sustainability are improved.
  10: This paper proposes using insurance-based risk reduction approaches for marine
    resource users exposed to climate shocks.
Highlights:
  1: Financial tools like insurance can help reduce sensitivity to climate shocks
    and improve long-term adaptive capacity for coastal communities; new risk-management
    tools can incentivize sustainable use of living marine resources and strengthen
    economic resilience of coastal communities.
  4: Marine climate shocks lead to economic losses and reduced adaptive capacity.
    Government disaster relief is often insufficient and delayed. Marine insurance
    is a potential alternative to reduce vulnerability to these shocks. Inefficiency
    and delay in federal emergency funding to support the local fishing industry have
    failed to reduce the vulnerability of these small communities to climate shocks
    such as hurricanes.
  5: Significant challenges remain for aquaculture insurance, particularly for small
    to medium-sized operations that remain uninsured, combined with impacts from climate
    shocks such as the 'Godzilla-Red tide' event.
  6: Improving accuracy of ocean forecasts and understanding of fish population dynamics
    are crucial for future insurance applications.
  7: Parametric insurance offers reduced costs and more timely payouts compared to
    indemnity insurance, but faces challenges related to basis risk (error in the
    index-loss relationship). Cooperative insurance models can leverage social capital
    and improve uptake.
  8: Insurance for marine climate shocks could unintentionally reduce income diversity
    in coastal communities and that government subsidy can support communities proactively
    by paying for (some fraction of) premiums or offering tax credits, for example,
    rather than through retrospective disaster relief.
  9: Rising cost of insurance is often used as an indicator that alternative risk
    management measures should be taken; Insurance can help actors conserve capital
    reserves as they are hit by climate shocks, which can then bolster their adaptive
    capacity; insurance helps people move to other sources of income or move into
    other fisheries.
  10: The main outcome is the proposal and discussion of using insurance-based risk
    reduction to bolster the resilience of coastal communities and blue-food sectors
    against climate change impacts. It highlights the potential for incentivizing
    sustainable practices through insurance premiums.
Methodology:
  1: Suggests convergence of insurance industry and marine sectors, fostered through
    collaboration with governments, academics, and NGOs to usher in new forms of insurance
    like ocean-index or parametric insurance.
  6: The challenges and viability of using insurance as a financial tool for managing
    climate risks in fisheries and aquaculture are discussed, with attention to issues
    like moral hazard and adverse selection.
  7: Discusses the mechanisms, advantages, and challenges of indemnity insurance,
    parametric insurance, and cooperative/risk-pool insurance models for blue food
    producers. Also mentions community-based fisheries management approaches.
  8: The paper discusses the need for insurance policies to adapt to the non-stationarity
    of the earth system and changing risks of marine climate shocks, requiring risk
    adjustments over time.
  9: 'Suggests stages of implementation: providing insurance design concepts, demonstration
    opportunities, accessing or building enabling capital, and maturing to a self-sustaining
    model.'
  10: The paper discusses adapting financial risk management tools, like parametric
    insurance, from the agricultural sector to the blue-foods sector. It suggests
    tying insurance to specific geographic regions or groups of producers (e.g., fishery
    cooperatives) and adjusting premiums based on sustainable practices. The paper
    calls for inclusive engagement of stakeholders and regular reviews of financial
    risk management tools to ensure ongoing relevance.
More Notes:
  1: Focuses on the potential of insurance to mitigate economic impacts of climate
    shocks on blue food sectors.
  4: Discusses the potential role of marine insurance in mitigating the impacts of
    climate shocks on blue-food sectors (commercial fisheries and aquaculture).
  6: The viability of insurance in marine systems is limited to regions practicing
    sustainable fisheries management.
  7: The page emphasizes the importance of trust, social capital, and robust organizational
    structure for successful cooperative self-insurance. It also acknowledges the
    role of technology advances in refining index-loss relationships for parametric
    insurance.
  8: The paper emphasizes the importance of considering the complex income landscapes
    and connectivity of supply chains in designing insurance tools for climate resilience.
  9: Discusses the challenge that insurance may serve to prop up failing industries;
    insurance premiums can also send a strong market signal that adaptation is required.
Quantitative material:
  4: "California Dungeness crab landings for the 2015\u201316 season reached only\
    \ 52% of the average catch of the previous 5 years, with a total value lost estimated\
    \ at US$97.5 million. Fisheries in Puerto Rico were devastated by Hurricane Maria\
    \ in September 2017: the hurricane caused commercial landings to fall by 20% due\
    \ to the loss of productive assets and power for extended periods and reduced\
    \ demand; economic losses have been estimated at US$17.8 million; damaged fishing\
    \ capital (i.e. vessel, engine, and gear) and shoreside infrastructure accounted\
    \ for 51% of the losses and forgone fishing revenue the remaining 49%."
  8: Tropical Cyclone Winston led to nearly F$600 million in losses in Fiji, with
    F$120 million from lost tourism alone.
