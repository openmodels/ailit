Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (specifically temperature changes); Projected growth of Gross
    Domestic Product per capita
  3: Changes in climate and tourist preferences are considered as risks impacting
    international tourism flows.
  7: Temperature (TempI, TempJ, Temp2I, Temp2J), Precipitation (PrecI, PrecJ), Coastline
    (CoastI, CoastJ)
  8: Changing climate conditions and tourist preferences influence tourism flows.
  10: Change in temperatures.
  12: Climate change, specifically global warming, and GDP per capita growth.
Highlights:
  1: Traditional warm destinations are expected to experience a greater loss of attractiveness,
    while high-latitude countries are expected to become more attractive due to climate
    change; Tourists' climate preferences have changed over the last 15 years.
  3: Climate change can impact international tourism flows, affecting the economy
    of countries reliant on tourism.
  7: Origin country coastline (CoastI) has a positive impact on promoting tourist
    departures. Destination country coastline (CoastJ) has a larger impact than origin
    country coastline. Good weather (implied by temperature, not directly a measure
    of climate risk) is also required for tourism.
  8: Tourism attractiveness increases for colder countries, while warmer origin countries
    see more international departures.
  10: Current warmer traditional destinations will be affected.
  12: Global warming is generally negative for warm destinations in terms of competitiveness.
    Climate change would imply a loss of attractiveness for traditional winter resorts
    and warmer destinations, but increase attractiveness for high latitude countries.
    There is an inverted u-shape relationship between temperature at the destination
    and tourism demand, revealing optimal climatic conditions for tourism. There is
    a u-shape relationship between temperature in the origin country and tourism demand,
    revealing optimal climatic conditions for remaining at home.
  13: The model projects international tourism demand but acknowledges limitations
    such as ignoring potential saturation effects on income elasticity and changes
    in preferences and demographics.
Methodology:
  1: A demand model for international tourism is estimated, including classic determinants
    and allowing a time-varying climatic sensitivity of tourists; Scenarios A2, B1,
    and B2 are used to project climate conditions and GDP per capita.
  3: "The study uses a large database of international tourism flows from 178 countries\
    \ between 1995\u20132010, considering variables like geographical distance, economic\
    \ size, and cultural relationships."
  4: Uses a gravity model to analyze international tourism flows, where tourism is
    considered a special type of trade in services. The model considers factors like
    income and distance, and introduces climatic variables.
  7: OLS estimation of Equations 3 and 4 with Huber-White estimator to obtain robust
    standard errors and origin, destination, and year fixed effects
  8: Analysis is based on dynamic tourism data from 1995 to 2010, considering temperature
    preferences.
  10: Compares tourist arrivals in 2080 to those in 2007 considering only the effect
    of temperature change under climate scenarios A2, B1, and B2.
  12: The analysis uses an unspecified estimation method to extrapolate estimates
    for A2, B1, and B2 climate change scenarios. Applicable to evaluating tourism
    demand responses in the context of global warming.
  13: The paper uses a national-scale model with annual data to project international
    tourism demand, using constant elasticities and sensitivity analyses on parameters.
    The model does not consider domestic tourism.
More Notes:
  1: Tourism represents 9.1% of the total world Gross Domestic Product.
  4: The paper aims to project international tourism flows for different climate change
    scenarios using a database of international tourism flows and potential determinants.
  7: The dependent variable for Equations 3 and 4 is not specified on this page. Significance
    levels are denoted by *, **, and *** for 1%, 5%, and 10% respectively. The data
    has 130,114 observations.
  8: The study highlights changing trends in tourist destinations and origins based
    on climatic conditions.
  10: Supplementary material S2 contains a complete table of international tourism
    arrival data.
  12: The paper suggests increased climate sensitiveness by international tourism
    and increased propensity to travel abroad from the warmest countries.
  13: The model's projections are subject to uncertainty inherent in social phenomena.
    The model is based on tourism data collected according to UN-WTO recommendations.
