Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased extreme heat, anthropogenic global warming, heat waves
  2: Extreme heat intensity and annual average temperature variations, particularly
    Tx5d (intensity of the most extreme heat wave in each year).
  3: Extreme heat (measured as intensity of the hottest 5-day period - Tx5d), temperature
    variability, annual average temperature.
  4: Anthropogenic increases in extreme heat, particularly affecting tropical regions
    more severely.
  5: Anthropogenic changes in extreme heat (Tx5d - change in max temp for 5 consecutive
    days).
  6: Anthropogenic changes in extreme heat intensity (Tx5d); Fossil fuel CO2 emissions.
  7: Increased extreme heat intensity, anthropogenic climate change, changes in average
    temperatures, changes in temperature variability.
  8: Extreme heat, anthropogenic changes in extreme heat.
  9: Extreme high temperatures (Tx5d), annual mean temperature (T), temperature variability
    (V), annual accumulated precipitation (P)
  10: Impact of anthropogenic changes in extreme temperatures (Tx5d) on growth.
  11: Global heat stress exposure; Global warming increases economic inequality; Climate
    conditions; Temperature shocks; Temperature variability; Heat stress; Atmospheric
    circulation patterns; Temperature-mortality relationship; Climate change; Cyclones.
  13: Extreme heat
Highlights:
  1: Human-caused increases in heat waves have depressed economic output most in the
    poor tropical regions least culpable for warming; Global inequality is both a
    cause and consequence of the unequal burden of climate change.
  2: Extreme heat decreases growth in warm regions, has weak effects in temperate
    regions, and increases growth in cold regions.
  3: Extreme heat causes large damages in low-latitude regions and transitions to
    modest damages and lastly benefits as latitude increases; both average and extreme
    temperatures have independent effects; people are poorly adapted to extreme heat.
  4: Tropical regions are particularly vulnerable to economic losses due to stronger
    effects of extreme heat and lower income levels.
  5: Anthropogenic changes to extreme heat have primarily harmed tropical regions.
    Regions with greater income per capita are more likely to experience benefits
    or limited damages from human-caused changes in heat extremes, while regions with
    lower income per capita experience greater relative damages.
  6: Poorer regions suffer most from extreme heat increases. Climate change increases
    global economic inequality. Rich countries, large emitters of CO2, are largely
    responsible for increases in global temperatures and heat extremes. High-emitting
    nations are directly responsible for warming-induced heat extremes and income
    losses suffered by individual regions. Damages are reduced if average temperatures
    are held constant, spatial pattern more closely resembling pattern of marginal
    effects in Fig. 1B.
  7: Increased extreme heat intensity significantly decreases economic growth in relatively
    warm tropical regions; anthropogenic climate change has amplified underlying inequality;
    the effects of climate change on extreme heat have amplified underlying inequality,
    disproportionately harming low-income, low-emitting regions.
  8: Warming has already increased the frequency and intensity of heat extremes, resulting
    in economic costs with an unequal global distribution.
  9: Extreme heat (Tx5d) has a negative impact on economic growth. The impact is heterogeneous
    and depends on the underlying climate in a region. Accounting for anthropogenic
    warming's contribution to extreme temperatures shows additional growth would occur
    without human-induced changes in Tx5d.
  10: Developed a global sample of continuous regional GDPpc data, first to treat
    parametric and residual uncertainty explicitly.
  11: Potential for significant economic damage reduction by achieving UN mitigation
    targets; Global warming has contributed to increased economic inequality; Significant
    effects of temperature and climate on economic production and growth.
  13: Globally unequal effect of extreme heat on economic growth
Methodology:
  1: Using subnational economic data, extreme heat metrics measuring the temperature
    of the hottest several days in each year, and an ensemble of climate models, we
    quantify the effect of extreme heat intensity on economic growth globally; Empirical
    estimation of the effect of extreme heat intensity on observed economic growth
    using data from a global sample of subnational regions.
  2: Empirical model includes effects of Tx5d and annual average temperature, with
    interaction effects; results extrapolated using historical climate model simulations.
  3: Empirical model controlling for mean temperatures; fixed effects model purging
    time-invariant regional characteristics; likelihood ratio test; model includes
    the effect of daily-scale temperature variability; interactions included for temperature,
    income, and drought.
  4: Empirical model using a distributed lag version to track persistence of heat
    impacts, involving historical climate data and CMIP6 models for counterfactual
    analysis.
  5: Uses a distributed lag model to estimate the effect of extreme heat intensity
    on economic growth. Downscales country-level GDPpc to regional GDPpc using nighttime
    luminosity. Performs Monte Carlo analysis to quantify uncertainty, resampling
    from econometric model, climate models, and statistical model used to predict
    regional GDPpc.
  6: Monte Carlo simulations used to estimate uncertainty. Least-squares regression
    used to examine the relationship between country's GDPpc percentile and the regional-average
    effect of anthropogenic changes to extreme heat. Damages calculation incorporates
    changes in mean temperatures along with extremes.
  7: Econometric estimation, use of Tx5d (temperature of the hottest 5-day heat wave)
    metric, subnational spatial scale analysis.
  8: Empirical regression methods at the subnational level; Climate model simulations
    to calculate counterfactual extreme heat time series for each region; Monte Carlo
    approach to propagate each source of uncertainty through the analysis.

    analysis applicable to regions with different climatological baseline temperatures
  10: Statistical model using country-level GDPpc and regional nightlights, with a
    Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis incorporating bootstrapping and various climate
    scenarios. Cross-validation and bootstrapping employed to ensure model reliability.

More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the macroeconomic costs of extreme heat and aims to quantify
    the global macroeconomic effects of extreme heat, identify the risks associated
    with intensifying heat waves, and close a key gap in climate-economic research.
  3: The relationship between average and extreme temperatures is complex; the value
    of incorporating Tx5d is supported by a likelihood ratio test; temperature is
    the primary moderator of the effect of extreme heat; adaptations have not been
    successful in eliminating the negative effects of extreme heat.
  4: Extreme heat initially affects economic growth, but recovery can occur, although
    repeated impacts might cause long-term changes.
  5: The analysis focuses on the period 1992-2013.  The model accounts for the fact
    that there is missing regional GDPpc data by using nighttime luminosity to downscale
    national-level GDPpc.
  6: The pattern of damages differs from the original pattern of the marginal effect
    of extremes. Focus is on historical effects of extreme heat.
  7: Data limitations exist in the world's hottest and lowest income regions, potentially
    leading to conservative estimates.
  8: The analysis uses nighttime luminosity data to infer local economic production.
    The study focuses on the economic costs of extreme heat events. The study uses
    a subnational-level analysis.
  9: The paper uses the Tx5d metric (hottest 5-day period) and interacts it with annual
    average temperature to account for regional heterogeneity in responses to extreme
    heat. Region-specific linear trends are added to control for time-varying unobserved
    confounders. Authors claim the effects are conservative
  10: Data and predictions do not apply empirical regression to constructed data;
    data available at github.com/ccallahan45/Global_Subnational_Income/.
  13: The title suggests a focus on the differential impact of extreme heat across
    nations, which is relevant to a global review.

  13: Economic growth
Quantitative material:
  1: "Cumulative 1992\u20132013 losses from anthropogenic extreme heat likely fall\
    \ between $5 trillion and $29.3 trillion globally; Losses amount to 6.7% of GDP\
    \ per capita per year for regions in the bottom income decile, but only 1.5% for\
    \ regions in the top income decile."
  2: Marginal effect of 0.63 percentage point decrease in GDP for Brazil with increased
    extreme heat intensity; 0.62 percentage point increase in GDP for Norway.
  3: Annual average temperatures explain ~40% of the variation in raw Tx5d values;
    the impact of variability is -2.01 p.p. per SD. Removing Tx5d terms, variability's
    impact increases to -2.21 p.p. per SD.
  4: "Tx5d temperature increase of 0.77\xB0C and 13 percentage points rise in extreme\
    \ heat probability globally over 1992\u20132013."
  5: "Cumulative global losses due to extreme heat average more than $16 trillion\
    \ in 2013.  Cumulative losses over 1992\u20132013 total $39 billion (2010-equivalent\
    \ dollars) in the average region in Brazil and $6.5 billion in the average Indonesian\
    \ region. Regions in the lowest income decile have experienced losses of 6.7%\
    \ of GDPpc per year, compared to 1.5% in the top income decile. Uncertainty ranges\
    \ for global losses are also provided."
  6: "Fig. 4A shows average annual change in regional GDPpc due to anthropogenic changes\
    \ in Tx5d intensity over 1992\u20132013. Fig. 4B shows cumulative 1992\u20132013\
    \ change in regional GDP in 2010 U.S. dollars due to anthropogenic changes in\
    \ Tx5d intensity. Fig. 4C shows cumulative global GDP change due to anthropogenic\
    \ changes in extreme heat, including uncertainty ranges. Fig. 4D shows average\
    \ annual change in regional GDPpc due to anthropogenic extreme heat, binned by\
    \ regional income deciles. High-latitude regions benefit from extreme heat in\
    \ our empirical setting but have suffered losses by anthropogenic forced changes\
    \ in extreme heat to date. Historical changes in average temperatures have caused\
    \ uniform losses globally, with greater magnitudes than the losses from extreme\
    \ heat."

    based on <2% of days in the year.
