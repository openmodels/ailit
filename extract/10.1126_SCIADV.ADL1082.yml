Drivers of Risk:
  1: Human-caused increases in heat waves, specifically the temperature of the hottest
    several days in each year (Tx5d).
  2: Extreme heat intensity (Tx5d), annual average temperature, and temperature variability
  3: Extreme heat events and temperature variability are identified as significant
    drivers of risk, impacting economic outcomes.
  4: The drivers of risk are anthropogenic changes in extreme heat, quantified by
    changes in Tx5d (maximum temperature over five days), and changes in average temperatures.
  5: Anthropogenic changes in extreme heat, specifically measured using Tx5d (changes
    in economic growth in subnational regions due to anthropogenic changes in Tx5d
    over 1992-2013).
  6: Anthropogenic changes in Tx5d intensity (intensity of the hottest 5 days of the
    year) and changes in average temperatures.
  7: Anthropogenic climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme
    heat, disproportionately affecting low-income, low-emitting tropical regions.
  8: Extreme heat (measured as the average daily maximum temperature of the hottest
    days).
  9: Extreme high temperatures (Tx5d), temperature variability (V), and annual mean
    temperature (T) are the drivers of risk.
  10: The primary driver of risk is anthropogenic changes in Tx5d (which the paper
    states requires climate data, i.e., the region's average temperature and Tx5d),
    specifically changes in extreme temperatures.

  13: Extreme heat
Evaluation overview:
  1: Economic growth globally, depressed by increased extreme heat.
  2: Economic growth
  3: The analysis evaluates the differential impacts of average and extreme temperatures
    on economic growth, suggesting significant independent effects of both.
  4: The paper evaluates the effect of anthropogenic extreme heat on economic production,
    specifically focusing on changes in Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDPpc).
  5: Evaluates the impact of anthropogenic changes in extreme heat (measured by Tx5d
    - changes in economic growth in subnational regions due to anthropogenic changes
    in Tx5d over 1992-2013) on GDPpc (Gross Domestic Product per capita).
  6: Economic effects of anthropogenic changes to extreme heat intensity, focusing
    on GDP and GDP per capita.
  7: The analysis focuses on the economic impact of changes in average temperatures
    and extreme heat on economic growth.
  8: Economic damages from extreme heat, specifically subnational economic growth
    changes due to anthropogenic changes in extreme heat, and regional income losses
    or benefits attributable to anthropogenic changes in extreme heat.
  9: Economic growth is being evaluated.
  10: This paper evaluates regional GDPpc (Gross Domestic Product per capita) as the
    outcome. It calculates accumulated economic damages from warming.
  11: Economic damages, heat stress exposure, economic inequality, aggregate economic
    output, economic production, economic growth, mortality, crop yields, economic
    output.
  13: Economic growth
Highlights:
  1: Human-caused increases in heat waves have depressed economic output most in the
    poor tropical regions least culpable for warming. Global inequality is both a
    cause and consequence of the unequal burden of climate change.
  2: Extreme heat significantly decreases economic growth in warm regions, weakly
    affects growth in temperate regions, and increases growth in cold regions. Warm
    tropical regions tend to have lower incomes and suffer the most from increased
    extreme temperatures.
  3: The model shows variability in extreme temperature effects, with significant
    negative impacts on economic growth and emphasizing the need for targeted adaptation
    strategies.
  4: Anthropogenic warming has increased the frequency and intensity of extreme heat
    events globally, particularly in the tropics. The spatial pattern of anthropogenic
    extreme heat coincides with both the stronger economic effect of extreme heat
    in the tropics and the lower incomes there, making tropical regions particularly
    vulnerable to losses from human-caused heat extremes. The effect of extreme heat
    can persist for one year after the event. Regions lose or gain multiple years
    of income in response to a heat wave.
  5: Anthropogenic changes to extreme heat have primarily harmed tropical regions.
    Regions with greater income per capita are more likely to experience benefits
    or limited damages from human-caused changes in heat extremes, while regions with
    lower income per capita experience greater relative damages. Cumulative global
    losses due to extreme heat are substantial, averaging more than $16 trillion in
    2013.
  6: Poorer regions suffer most from increased extreme heat. Rich countries, being
    large emitters of fossil fuel CO2, are primarily responsible for increases in
    global temperatures and associated heat extremes. High-emitting nations can be
    considered directly responsible for a large fraction of warming-induced heat extremes
    and, by extension, the income losses suffered by individual regions. Historical
    changes in average temperatures have caused uniform losses globally, with greater
    magnitudes than the losses from extreme heat.
  7: Increased extreme heat intensity decreases economic growth more significantly
    in tropical regions and emphasizes that costs from temperature extremes are distinct
    from average temperature changes.
  8: Targeting resources at heat resilience and early-warning capabilities for only
    a few days per year may yield disproportionate economic benefits. Warming has
    already increased the frequency and intensity of heat extremes, results demonstrate
    the economic costs of these events and their unequal global distribution.
  9: The study aims to isolate the causal effect of heat intensity on the hottest
    days of the year on economic growth. Regions with larger annual cycles are less
    harmed by temperature variability. Warm regions may invest in technologies such
    as air conditioning due to their greater exposure to high temperatures. Results
    from an additional model regression yield even stronger effects for Tx5d, indicating
    that the main results should be viewed as conservative.
  10: The paper produces a global sample of continuous GDPpc data at the regional
    level with an explicit treatment of parametric and residual uncertainty, and makes
    the dataset available to the community.

    warming has increased global economic inequality; Climatic constraints on aggregate
    economic output; Day-to-day temperature variability reduces economic growth; Increased
    burden of heat-related mortality attributable to recent human-induced climate
    change; Poorest countries experience earlier anthropogenic emergence of daily

  13: Globally unequal effect of extreme heat on economic growth
Methodology:
  1: Uses subnational economic data, extreme heat metrics, and an ensemble of climate
    models to quantify the effect of extreme heat intensity on economic growth globally.
  2: Empirical model includes Tx5d, annual average temperature, their interaction,
    and temperature variability. Historical climate model simulations are used to
    assess economic effects of anthropogenic changes in extreme heat intensity. Extrapolation
    is used for regions without economic data, based on average temperatures.
  3: The analysis uses interaction models with extreme heat metrics (Tx5d) and annual
    mean temperatures to assess impacts, supported by likelihood ratio tests for explanatory
    power.
  4: The analysis uses a distributed lag model to estimate the impact of extreme heat
    on economic growth. Historical and natural climate model experiments from CMIP6
    are used to calculate counterfactual Tx5d. A statistical model infers regional
    GDPpc time series where they are not available. The analysis is applicable to
    the period 1992-2013.
  5: The analysis uses climate model simulations to calculate growth change values,
    which are then applied to generate counterfactual regional GDPpc. A statistical
    model downscales country-level GDPpc to regional GDPpc using country-level GDPpc
    and regional nighttime luminosity. Monte Carlo analysis is used to quantify uncertainty,
    resampling from the econometric model, climate models, the statistical model,
    and residual uncertainty in regional GDPpc. Analysis covers the period 1992-2013.
  6: Uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate uncertainty. Compares damages from changes
    in extreme temperatures to changes in average temperatures. Considers the role
    of fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Uses data from 1992-2013.
  7: The study measures extreme heat using Tx5d, an index of the hottest 5-day period
    in each year, focusing primarily on extreme heat intensity rather than frequency
    or duration.
  8: Estimates the effect of extreme heat on growth using empirical regression methods
    at the subnational level; uses climate model simulations to calculate counterfactual
    extreme heat time series for each region; uses the empirical results along with
    the counterfactual heat wave data to calculate subnational economic growth changes
    due to anthropogenic changes in extreme heat; uses country-level income data and
    regional nighttime luminosity data to generate continuous regional GDPpc time
    series; and calculates regional income losses or benefits attributable to anthropogenic
    changes in extreme heat. Uncertainty is estimated using bootstrapping, sampling
    residual uncertainty, multiple climate models, and a Monte Carlo approach.
  9: Panel regression with fixed effects is used to model economic growth as a function
    of temperature variables. Tx5d is calculated by taking 5-day running means of
    daily maximum temperature, temporally aggregating to the annual maximum, and then
    spatially aggregating by calculating regional population-weighted averages. The
    study uses data from 1979-2016. A distributed lag version of the regression equation
    is used to examine whether the effects of extreme temperatures persist over time.
    Bootstrapping is used to estimate sampling uncertainty in the regression coefficients.
    Counterfactual Tx5d values are calculated as the observed Tx5d time series minus
    the smoothed difference between the historical and natural simulations (CMIP6).
  10: The paper develops a statistical model (Eq. 2) to predict regional GDPpc using
    country-level GDPpc and regional average nighttime luminosity (nightlights) from
    1992-2013. They use ordinary least squares regression and a 10-fold cross-validation
    analysis to test the out-of-sample predictive power. They then use a Monte Carlo
    analysis to incorporate and propagate uncertainty, using 10,000 iterations. Counterfactual
    GDPpc is calculated by adding the growth change due to anthropogenic temperature
    changes to the downscaled GDPpc time series.

More Notes:
  1: The paper aims to directly quantify the global macroeconomic effects of extreme
    heat and close a gap in climate-economic research.
  2: The study notes that extrapolation to regions without economic data is a key
    limitation. Region-specific growth trends are considered as a robustness check,
    but not included in the main model due to potential overfitting.
  3: The study indicates that current adaptations to extreme heat are insufficient,
    stressing the importance of continued adaptation investments alongside climate
    mitigation efforts.
  5: The paper acknowledges missing regional GDPpc data and addresses this with a
    statistical downscaling model. The paper also includes an uncertainty analysis.
  6: The spatial pattern of damages from anthropogenic heat differs from the marginal
    effect of extremes because the damages calculation incorporates changes in mean
    temperatures along with extremes. Warmer annual mean temperatures make extremes
    more harmful. Holding average temperatures constant reduces damages substantially.

Quantitative material:
  1: "Cumulative 1992\u20132013 losses from anthropogenic extreme heat likely fall\
    \ between $5 trillion and $29.3 trillion globally. Losses amount to 6.7% of Gross\
    \ Domestic Product per capita per year for regions in the bottom income decile,\
    \ but only 1.5% for regions in the top income decile."
  2: "In Brazil (23.8\xB0C average), a 1 SD increase in Tx5d intensity depresses growth\
    \ by 0.63 percentage points. In Norway (4\xB0C average), a 1 SD increase in Tx5d\
    \ intensity enhances growth by 0.62 percentage points."
  3: Annual average temperatures explain ~40% of the variation in extreme temperature
    values, whereas within-region temperature variations explain less than 13%.
  4: "Globally, regional Tx5d values average 0.77\xB0C more than they would have without\
    \ warming over 1992\u20132013, with increases of more than 1\xB0C in much of the\
    \ tropics but less than 0.5\xB0C in the United States and Europe. The probability\
    \ of extreme Tx5d values has increased by 13 percentage points across regions,\
    \ on average."
  5: Cumulative global losses due to extreme heat average more than $16 trillion in
    2013. Tropical regions have GDPpc >5% per year lower than it would have been without
    anthropogenic effects on extreme heat. High-latitude nations such as Canada and
    Finland, anthropogenic extreme heat changes have depressed GDPpc by ~1% per year.
    Regions in the lowest income decile have experienced losses of 6.7% of GDPpc per
    year, compared to 1.5% in the top income decile.

  8: The sample contains data from 1368 regions, each with between 4 and 38 years
    of data, for a total of 26,918 observations.
  9: "The calculation estimates a region-scale time series of the change in economic\
    \ growth (\uF044g) due to anthropogenic warming impacts on extreme heat."
  10: The paper finds that country-level GDPpc alone explains 87% of the variation
    in regional GDPpc in their sample. The model with the smallest out-of-sample prediction
    error includes only country-level GDPpc and regional nightlights, with prediction
    errors of less than 7% of the average regional log GDPpc. The predicted values
    from the regional downscaling model explain ~87% of variation in the observed
    data when Uzbekistan and Kenya are included, and ~90% when they are dropped.
