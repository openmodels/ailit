Drivers of Risk:
  3: Increasing temperatures, heat wave frequency, and ocean acidification.
  4: Human-induced CO2 emission is a global phenomenon with different regional consequences
    affecting the Mediterranean Sea through climate change and ocean acidification.
  5: Ocean acidification impacting fish and mollusc production.
  12: Ocean acidification due to elevated seawater CO2 conditions; warming.
  14: Ocean acidification (high CO2 levels), high sea surface temperature, low river
    runoff.
  16: Ocean acidification and warming conditions in the Mediterranean Sea affecting
    biodiversity and habitat formations.
  17: Elevated seawater temperature, invasion by non-indigenous algae (benefiting
    from increased CO2 and elevated temperature), ocean acidification (specifically
    detrimental effects of ocean acidification on the economically important Mediterranean
    red coral endemic species Corallium rubrum).
  21: Future ocean acidification and increased water temperatures due to unabated
    global CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.
  22: Acidification and warming of the Mediterranean Sea.
  38: No relevant information
Highlights:
  3: Ocean acidification should be factored into fisheries and aquaculture management
    plans; rising CO2 levels are expected to reduce coastal biodiversity, altering
    ecosystem functioning and possibly impacting tourism.
  12: Warming and acidification extend the temporal window of sub-optimal conditions
    for Mediterranean mussels, decreasing survival and growth; ocean acidification
    negatively impacts embryonic and larval shellfish stages regarding survival, development
    rate, growth, and calcification.
  14: Ocean acidification can negatively impact fish survival, growth, and behavior,
    with species-specific responses. High sea surface temperature and low river runoff
    negatively correlate with landings of anchovies and sardines in the Northwestern
    Mediterranean Sea. Some species (e.g., seabream) show resilience to ocean acidification.
  20: Ocean acidification and warming can lead to proliferation of harmful algae blooms,
    expansion of toxin-producing species, and increased bioaccumulation of metals
    in marine organisms, posing risks to human health through contaminated seafood
    consumption.
  21: Ocean acidification and warming are a threat to the Mediterranean Sea and will
    negatively impact biodiversity, productivity, and key social and economic services
    like shellfish aquaculture, fisheries, and tourism.

Methodology:
  12: Laboratory experiments; review of existing literature.
  14: Observational studies and experiments exposing fish to different CO2 levels.
    Correlation analysis of landings with environmental factors.
  22: Integrated economic valuation of key economic sectors like tourism, in addition
    to fisheries.

More Notes:
  3: The paper recommends monitoring ocean acidification and assessing likely socio-economic
    impacts to build adaptive strategies.
  12: The impact of ocean acidification on oysters and mussels coincides with the
    beginning of shell formation (the trochophore stage).
  17: The paper suggests that the malfunction of calcifying and non-calcifying habitat-forming
    species will lead to knock-on ecological effects, limiting the biodiversity and
    functional diversity of ecosystems, and potentially altering the sustenance of
    fish stocks. The fate of deep-sea builders of hotspot biodiversity remain uncertain.
  22: Emphasis on stakeholder involvement, public-private partnerships, and communication
    strategies for successful adaptation.
  38: The presented data relate to production and capture, as well as distribution
    across countries and shellfish types. The pie charts labeled B and C do not have
    specific context related to climate change, macroeconomic/fiscal risks or adaptation.
    Therefore it is difficult to infer or connect these graphics to relevant outcomes
    as listed in the instructions without further context.
No relevant information:
  10: This page focuses on the impact of ocean acidification on shellfish, with no
    direct connection to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level.
  13: No macroeconomic or macro-fiscal information is included on this page; the analysis
    is focused on biological impacts of ocean acidification and warming on mollusks
    and fish.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Impacts to tourism, particularly in Mediterranean countries.
  4: Economic sectors such as tourism and cultural heritage benefit from the Mediterranean's
    exceptional biodiversity; aquaculture and fisheries contribute to local and national
    income.
  5: Potential economic impacts on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors due to ocean
    acidification.
  12: Decreased survival and growth of shellfish; impaired recruitment of organisms
    from plankton impacting shellfish industries.
  14: Potential effects on recruitment success of fish populations, impacting fisheries
    (potentially affecting GDP and employment in the fisheries sector).
  17: Loss of biodiversity and shore erosion due to the extinction of vermetid reefs,
    reduced fisheries and recreational tourism revenue due to the decline of calcifying
    corals, and altered sustenance of fish stocks due to habitat malfunction.
  21: Negative impact on shellfish aquaculture, fisheries, and tourism, impacting
    social and economic services provided by the Mediterranean Sea to human communities.
  22: Economic value of losses in fisheries and tourism due to acidification and warming
    of the Mediterranean Sea; Costs/benefits of policy action related to mitigation
    and/or adaptation; Costs of policy inaction related to mitigation and/or adaptation.

Quantitative material:
  4: Fisheries and aquaculture in the Mediterranean Sea represent 1% of world landings
    and 2% in terms of economic value; Aquaculture production has quadrupled in production
    reaching 20% in 2011; Pelagic fish account for 53% of the total Mediterranean
    catch (about 460,000 tonnes in 2011).
  5: Capture fisheries and aquaculture directly employ 250,000 and 123,000 people
    respectively, with 210,000 in the secondary sector. Gilthead seabream production
    rose from 3,833 tonnes in 1990 to 143,295 tonnes in 2010 (worth approximately
    US$ 785 million). European seabass production rose from 2,944 t in 1990 to 131,509
    t in 2010 (valued at US$ 786 million).
