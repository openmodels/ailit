  9: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme weather events, climate and weather forecasts indicating heightened risk
    of disaster.
  4: "El Ni\xF1o events and related floods are the main drivers of risk, particularly\
    \ as predicted by sea surface temperatures. Rainfall intensity exceeding a 1-in-30\
    \ year return period can also trigger alerts."
  5: Forecasted probability of a disaster; whether or not forecast-based action is
    taken.
Highlights:
  1: Forecast-based financing can improve effectiveness at reducing the risk of disaster
    by using early warnings to trigger disaster risk reduction actions.
  4: "The paper discusses the development of an El Ni\xF1o contingent insurance product\
    \ in Peru that aimed to compensate firms for flood related damages."
  5: Forecast-based action is worthwhile if the losses in a business-as-usual scenario
    exceed the combined costs and losses with forecast-based action. Equation 2 defines
    this relationship quantitatively.
Methodology:
  1: Proposes a forecast-based financing system to automatically trigger action based
    on climate forecasts or observations, matching threshold forecast probabilities
    with appropriate actions and disbursing required funding.
  4: The paper proposes a forecast-based financing mechanism coupled to risk-based
    operating procedures. It highlights matching forecasts with appropriate actions
    based on lead time and forecast probability.  It integrates information about
    worthwhile actions, available funding mechanisms, and designated responsible entities.
  5: Compares costs and losses under scenarios with and without forecast-based action.
    The analysis is performed iteratively for each probability that could be issued
    by a forecasting system to identify thresholds at which it is 'worth' taking action.
More Notes:
  1: The paper addresses the gap in using hydrometeorological early warning information
    to trigger disaster risk reduction actions in timescales of hours to months between
    a climate-based warning and a disaster.
  4: The paper emphasizes the importance of acting based on skillful forecasts and
    matching the strength of the forecast with the appropriate actions.
  5: The discount rate is not acknowledged due to actions usually taking place on
    timescales of less than a year. Actions may also have long-term benefits, regardless
    of disaster incidence.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Avoided disaster losses can at least double or quadruple the investment in risk
    reduction.
  4: The paper discusses business interruption insurance designed to compensate for
    lost profits or extra costs due to catastrophic floods.
  5: Economic consequences of acting on forecasts (costs and losses) vs. not acting
    (losses only). Mentions potential reputational risk from false alarms.
Quantitative material:
  1: Avoided disaster losses can at least double or quadruple the investment in risk
    reduction.
  5: Presents a contingency table and a formula (Equation 2) for determining when
    forecast-based action is worthwhile based on costs (C), losses (L), and the number
    of times different outcomes occur (hits, false alarms, misses, correct rejections).
