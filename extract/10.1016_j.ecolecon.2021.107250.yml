Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature, low agricultural potential
  2: Rising temperatures; Low agricultural potential
  3: Temperature interacting with agricultural potential influences conflict incidence;
    conflict is seen as a possible outcome of natural resource degradation or climate
    events.
  4: Annual variation in temperature interacting with agricultural potential.
  5: The probability of conflict increases with temperature changes, especially in
    countries with low agricultural potential.
  11: Temperature
  13: Temperature, and interactions of temperature with agricultural vs. non-agricultural
    sectors, OECD vs. non-OECD countries, and OPEC vs. non-OPEC countries.
  15: Temperature (Temp), Interaction (Inter) between temperature and other factors,
    Standardized temperature (Std), Decennial average temperature (Decade).
  16: Average temperature at the country level over the period 1946-2014; Agricultural
    potential (share of land with a suitability index greater than 40).
Highlights:
  1: Low agricultural potential exacerbates the effect of temperature on civil conflicts.
  2: Initial agricultural conditions play a significant role in understanding climate-conflict
    linkages on a global scale.
  3: The study aims at establishing the causal link between temperature and conflicts
    through the magnifying effects of agricultural potential.
  4: Countries with low agricultural potential have a larger probability to be in
    conflict in response to a deviation from their mean annual temperature compared
    to high agricultural potential countries.
  5: High agricultural potential reduces the probability of conflict more effectively
    in the long run than short run, with a 10% decrease in conflict probability from
    a one-degree deviation for high potential countries.
  11: The effect of temperature and its interaction on the outcome are estimated,
    with results shown for different model specifications.
  13: Temperature has a statistically significant positive effect on the outcome variable.
    The effect of temperature is significantly different in agricultural vs. non-agricultural
    sectors, OECD vs. non-OECD countries, and OPEC vs. non-OPEC countries.
  15: Temperature and its interaction with other factors have statistically significant
    effects on the outcome variable (as coefficients are different than zero given
    the confidence intervals). The direction and magnitude of the effects vary depending
    on how temperature is measured (Temp, Inter, Std, Decade) and whether an interaction
    term is included.
  16: "The red zones denote areas of highest conflict prediction, primarily located\
    \ where average temperatures are around 10\xB0C to 18\xB0C, with varying agricultural\
    \ potential; blue areas show regions of lower predicted conflict incidence and\
    \ are predominantly found in areas with either extreme high or low temperatures,\
    \ and varying agricultural potential."
Methodology:
  2: Natural experiment using data for 172 countries from 1946 until 2014, examining
    the interaction between time-wise variations in temperature and cross-country
    variation in agricultural potential on conflict incidence. Long-term relationships
    are analyzed using decennial averages.
  3: A linear probability model is used to examine the effect of the interaction between
    temperature and agricultural potential on conflict incidence; the model uses country
    fixed effects and year fixed effects to control for unobserved variables; approach
    is akin to a natural experiment.
  4: The study uses conflict data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program and climate
    data from the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia. It defines
    agricultural potential based on the project for Global Agricultural Productivity
    and Ecological Zones (GAEZ) from the Food and Agricultural Organization. It analyzes
    the causal effect of the interaction between annual variation in temperature and
    agricultural potential on the incidence of intrastate conflict.
  5: The study examines the relationship between standardized temperature changes
    and conflict rates, using decade averages to assess long-run effects.
  11: Linear probability model with country fixed effects, time fixed effects, robust
    standard errors clustered at the country level. The model includes variations
    using only temperature, temperature and an interaction term, standardized temperature,
    and decennial temperature averages.
  13: Panel regression with country and year fixed effects, robust standard errors
    clustered at the country level. The analysis is applicable to a panel of countries
    over time, but the time period is not specified on this page.
  15: Linear probability model with country and time fixed effects and robust standard
    errors clustered at the country level. Regression includes a constant term. Temperature
    is included as a covariate; interaction terms include temperature and other unspecified
    factors.
  16: The analysis uses a contour plot to visualize the relationship between average
    temperature and agricultural potential, depicting predicted values of conflict
    incidence.
More Notes:
  1: This is a preprint, so the findings are preliminary and not peer-reviewed. A
    version of this preprint was published at Ecological Economics on February 1st,
    2022.
  2: The interaction between temperature and agricultural potential has no significant
    effect in countries with exportable resources such as oil.
  3: The paper focuses on the link between temperature, agricultural potential, and
    conflict, framing climate change as a 'multiplier of threats'.
  4: The paper focuses on intrastate conflicts with a clearly defined political incompatibility
    and uses a binary variable to describe conflict incidence. The agricultural potential
    is defined based on cereals potential yields from a rain regime and a low level
    of inputs.
  6: This paper primarily focuses on the relationship between climate, agricultural
    potential, and conflict, rather than providing quantitative estimates of macroeconomic
    or fiscal impacts or adaptation costs/benefits. The mention of income shocks potentially
    leading to civil conflict is the closest connection, but it is not explicitly
    quantified. The paper argues that unfavorable agricultural potential may lead
    to a history of violence through poor self-reinforcing socio-economic outcomes
  11: The number of observations varies (9344 or 990) depending on the regression.
    Agricultural potential is captured by country fixed effects.
  13: The outcome variable is not explicitly defined on this page, limiting the interpretability
    of the results.
  15: Agricultural potential is controlled for by country fixed effects. The number
    of observations is either 9344 or 990, depending on whether decennial averages
    are used. The nature of the interaction term is not specified.
  16: The figure presents predicted conflict incidence but does not directly address
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, costs, or benefits of adaptation. The
    supplementary material, 'SupplementaryMaterialanonym.pdf', may contain additional
    relevant information not available from the figure and description.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Civil conflict
  2: No relevant information
  3: No relevant information
  4: No relevant information
  11: No relevant information
  13: The effect of temperature on some unspecified macroeconomic outcome.
  15: The nature of the outcome is not explicitly stated but it is estimated using
    a linear probability model, implying that it could be a binary indicator of some
    event or condition related to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal conditions. The specific
    economic variable being affected by temperature changes is not mentioned on this
    page.
  16: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  2: There is a 4% higher probability of civil conflict when annual temperature deviates
    from its mean in a country with low agricultural potential relative to a country
    with high agricultural potential.
  3: No relevant information
  4: A change of one degree Celsius is associated with an increase in the probability
    of being in conflict by 4.1% relatively to better endowed countries, for countries
    with no land above the medium Suitability Index threshold.
  5: A one-degree Celsius increase could decrease conflict probability by 5.1% in
    high agricultural potential countries compared to poorly endowed ones.
  11: Coefficient on temperature ranges from approximately 0.0175 to 0.0410, and the
    coefficient of the interaction term ranges from approximately -0.1405 to 0.0392.
  13: A 1 degree increase in temperature is associated with a 0.040 to 0.041 increase
    in the outcome variable (significant at the 5% or 10% level). Interaction terms
    suggest this effect varies depending on the type of country or sector.
