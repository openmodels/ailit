Drivers of Risk:
  4: Climate change, specifically changes in temperature, precipitation, relative
    humidity, and wind speed. Also, potential market barriers to adaptation due to
    constraints on factor mobility between zones.
  5: Heterogeneous vegetation types and socioeconomic factors within India, impacted
    by climate change (inferred, not explicitly stated on this page).
  6: Climate change impacts adaptation in India, population growth, availability of
    natural resources, technological change, depletion of oil reserves
  10: Climate change affecting Indian forests (CCI), Climate change affecting forests
    globally (CCG), Temperature increases, Precipitation increases
  11: Climate change impacts on forest growth, which leads to changes in biomass and
    rotation periods, impacting timber supply and land value.
  12: Changes in biomass growth and demand put pressure on forested land and affect
    deforestation.
  13: Climate change impacts on forestry sector leading to changes in biomass growth,
    product prices, and rent; constraints to mobility of primary input factors (labor,
    capital, and natural resources); wage stickiness.
  14: Reduction in forest harvest affecting production of goods and services, moving
    production to zones with lower labor and capital costs.
  15: Climate change impacts on forests (biomass growth, forest rent).
Highlights:
  5: The division of India into six zones within the GRACE model is a compromise between
    representing diverse ecologies and the limitations of the model and available
    socioeconomic data. It is better than treating India as a single region.
  10: India's forests are characterized by a broad diversity, harvest is dominated
    by teak in most zones except the northern and eastern parts where sal dominates,
    most of the biomass is found in the southern zones; temperature and precipitation
    are expected to increase in all zones by 2085
  11: Adaptation impacts include changes in forest biomass, rotation periods, supply
    of timber, and rents for forested land due to climate change.
  12: Forestry's impact on the Indian economy is minor despite changes due to climate
    impacts and adaptation, with minor differences between CCI and CCG scenarios.
  13: Adaptation in the forestry sector is strongly driven by market responses. Climate
    change impacts affect wages and capital prices differently across zones due to
    mobility constraints. Wage stickiness may lead to local unemployment.
  14: Production in the lumber industry changes significantly more than other industries,
    with a move towards less costly zones.
  15: Responses to climate change are significant within all the components of adaptation,
    but forestry contributes a relatively small share of the total Indian economy.
Methodology:
  4: Uses the ecological model IBIS (version 2.5) to estimate vegetation growth and
    soil carbon accumulation based on climate and soil data, and the computable general
    equilibrium model GRACE-IN to analyze the impacts of climate change on the economy,
    dividing the world into three regions (EU, India, ROW) and India into six zones.
  5: Uses the GRACE model with six zones representing different regions of India.
    The zones are defined by geographical area.
  6: Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Model; Economic growth is calibrated to
    the A2_ASF scenario by IPCC. Model uses savings ratios, capital allocation via
    a global bank, and remuneration to factors of production. Labour and capital flow
    between sectors within sub-regions. For India, the flow of labour and capital
    across zones is constrained
  10: Uses the IBIS model to calculate biomass and sawtimber; Calibrates a Lotka-Volterra
    function to determine optimal rotation time; Model runs from 2004 to 2085 under
    a reference scenario and two climate change scenarios (CCI and CCG)
  12: Analysis considers the impacts of climate change on forests, with macroeconomic
    implications determined for India's economy.
  13: Analysis is performed by simulating the impact of climate change on the forestry
    sector and its knock-on effects on the economy, using a model that accounts for
    agent responses to price changes and factor substitution. Results are applicable
    to the zones within India which are studied.
  14: Analysis performed by examining geographical shifts in production due to changes
    in labor and capital costs.
  15: Uses the IBIS ecological model to represent the ecosystem in the GRACE computable
    general equilibrium model to analyze climate change impacts in India. The model
    differentiates between six Indian zones and connects India to the global economy.
    Analysis is applicable for the year 2085.
More Notes:
  5: The paper acknowledges that ideally, zones should represent homogenous vegetation
    and socioeconomic factors, but this is difficult to achieve due to the heterogeneity
    within India.
  6: The model assumes full utilization of all available resources within each region.
  13: The burden of changes in wages and capital prices is carried by those communities
    where forestry contributes a major activity. The contribution of forestry to the
    total economy in the six zones is very small.
  14: India is a net importer of timber, but climate change shifts this to a relative
    increase in exports.
  15: Higher biomass growth may actually increase the risk of deforestation.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  5: None
  6: Economic growth, return to capital
  10: Biomass, Net primary productivity, Harvest
  12: Forestry contributes a minor share to India's GDP, and climate impacts on forests
    increase GDP contribution by only 1%.
  13: Changes in wages and prices of capital in different zones.
  14: The impact on GDP due to changes in total production costs, although too small
    to convert GDP loss to a benefit, may occur if activities shift to zones with
    declining production costs.
  15: Macroeconomic impacts for each zone, although very small compared with the total
    Indian economy.
Quantitative material:
  5: None
  10: "GDP Bill US$ for different zones; Biomass (10^6 tC); Net primary productivity\
    \ (10^6 tC); Harvest (10^6 tC); Temperature increases (3.5\xB0C to 4.6\xB0C);\
    \ Precipitation increases (16.5% to 43.1%)"
  11: The biomass stock change percentage and rotation period changes for different
    zones by 2085 are provided.
  12: Net primary productivity increases by nearly 80% in the West zone in 2085, with
    a harvest increase of only 22.5%.
  13: Fig. 5 shows changes in wages and price of capital in the CCI scenario by zone
    for 2005, 2045, and 2085. Wages are reduced in the South and Central zones, and
    increasing in the other four zones.
  14: Exports from forestry in India increase by 3.3% in 2045 and 5.0% in 2085 in
    the CCI scenario, with smaller increases in the CCG scenario.
  15: Changes in rotation period range from a reduction of 1 year and an increase
    of 6 years in the six zones.
