Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change impacts on grain production.
  3: Physical climate change impact on agriculture (crop yield and production); Domestic
    production affecting domestic supply and consumption; Abroad production affecting
    domestic consumption
  4: Countries pursue self-sufficiency for food security due to risks like food insecurity,
    volatile export earnings, potential for self-sufficiency, reliance on few suppliers,
    large population, and threat of trade disruptions.
  8: Climate change impact on yield of maize, wheat and rice due to land productivity
    changes
  12: Temperature and precipitation changes due to climate change.
  13: Temperature (dominant factor), precipitation (positive impact).
  14: Temperature change under RCP8.5 scenario 2100 (and other scenarios for benefits)
  15: Temperature change in RCP8.5 scenario 2100
  16: Grain self-sufficiency is impacted by climate change, with countries producing
    less than 100% of their grain needs being vulnerable.
  17: Temperature changes for RCP4.5, 2050
  18: Climate change impacts via land productivity
  19: Direct climate change impacts on land productivity, particularly for wheat.
  21: Direct climate change impacts on land productivity, specifically for rice.
  22: Temperature changes
  23: Global warming (climate change), specifically under different Representative
    Concentration Pathways (RCPs).
Highlights:
  2: Focus on major grain-producing and consuming countries like China, India, and
    France.
  12: Temperature is the dominant factor driving grain production losses. Adaptation
    can mitigate these losses. Losses are expected to be larger in 2100 compared to
    2050, except perhaps under RCP2.6. RCP8.5 shows the largest losses.
  13: Temperature is the dominant factor affecting grain production. RCP8.5 leads
    to consistent losses in grain production, while RCP2.6 and 4.5 may show benefits
    in the short term (2050) but turn to losses in the long term (2100). Losses are
    larger in 2100 compared to 2050.
  14: Top grain producers (USA, China, India) suffer the largest losses. No country
    benefits under RCP8.5 2100, but some benefit under other scenarios. China shows
    notable increases in grain production after adaptation. Russia is relatively the
    most damaged in some cases.
  15: India and USA are consistently among the top 3 countries experiencing the largest
    grain production losses; Some countries like Canada, Germany, and Turkey may benefit
    in all cases; Adaptation measures appear to be more effective in Brazil relative
    to China and other unnamed countries.
  16: Climate change does not alter the overall picture of grain self-sufficiency
    but has relative effects on specific regions.
  18: Direct climate change impacts via land productivity are considerable, especially
    for maize; production effects cancel out most of the direct climate change impacts;
    consumption is reduced marginally.
  19: Climate change will significantly reduce Russia's grain self-sufficiency, particularly
    in wheat, necessitating increased imports.
  21: Despite considerable direct climate change impacts on land productivity, especially
    for rice, production effects appear to offset these impacts, resulting in relatively
    stable grain consumption and an increase in grain self-sufficiency rate.
  22: Under the RCP8.5 scenario in 2100, all regions are projected to benefit from
    increased grain prices, with the USA, China, India, and Pakistan benefiting the
    most.
  23: Global warming leads to global reduction in grain production. Russia may suffer
    the most in terms of self-sufficiency, while USA and India suffer the most in
    tonnes of output. Climate change impact on self-sufficiency may be overestimated
    without considering behavior adjustment of economic agents.
Methodology:
  2: Use of agricultural models, climate scenarios, and adaptation strategies to assess
    impacts on grain supply.
  3: SSR measures food security by considering both production and consumption.
  8: Calculates country-level average climate data from 32 climate models in CMIP5;
    Calculates climate change impact on crop yields using an econometric model (Moore
    et al 2017) and removes outliers; Calculates average rates of yield changes by
    country; Estimates economic impacts using GRACE.
  12: The analysis uses RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 8.5) to project future grain production
    losses. It appears to consider the impact of producers' adaptation measures.
  13: The analysis uses different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to
    project grain production losses, considering temperature and precipitation. The
    results are applicable to the years 2050 and 2100.
  14: Modeling of land productivity under different temperature change scenarios,
    likely using agricultural or integrated assessment models.
  15: Comparison of grain production losses with and without adaptation in the RCP8.5
    scenario for the year 2100
  19: Analysis projects changes under RCP8.5 scenario for the year 2100.
  21: The analysis appears to be based on simulations under the RCP8.5 scenario for
    the year 2100, projecting percentage changes in the described metrics.
  22: The analysis uses the RCP8.5 scenario to model the effects of temperature changes
    in 2100 on farm income and maize prices.
  23: The paper analyzes the impact of climate change on grain production and consumption
    under different RCPs (4.5, 8.5, and 2.6), considering the impact on grain self-sufficiency
    and trade. The methodology considers behavior adjustment of economic agents.
More Notes:
  2: The article explores the need for adaptation measures to mitigate climate change
    impacts on food security.
  13: The bar chart visually reinforces the textual information, showing the percentage
    change in grain production under different scenarios and time horizons, with RCP8.5
    leading to the most significant negative impacts, especially when both temperature
    and precipitation are considered (T&P).
  14: Adaptation measures seem to have the potential to increase grain production
    in China under the RCP8.5 2100 scenario.
  15: The analysis focuses on grain production specifically, and the results are specific
    to the RCP8.5 climate scenario in 2100. The definition of 'adaptation' is not
    stated.
  17: The maps show SSR (%), Consumption (%), Land (%), and Production (%) by country,
    providing visual insight into global food security. The logo indicates the source
    of the information is likely CICERO.
  18: The analysis focuses on the agricultural sector, specifically rice, wheat, maize,
    and grain in China. The effects are modeled under the RCP8.5 2100T climate scenario.
    The presence of the CICERO logo suggests a potential source or affiliation of
    the research.
  19: Production effects partially offset the direct negative impacts of climate change
    on land productivity.
  21: The bar chart visually compares the SSR, Land productivity impact, Production,
    and Consumption across Rice, Wheat, Maize, and Grain categories, showing significant
    differences, specifically highlighting that consumption is negative across all
    categories. The word CICERO might refer to the name of the institution where the
    research work was undertaken.
  22: The analysis focuses specifically on the impact of temperature changes on farm
    income and maize prices, without detailing impacts on other macroeconomic or fiscal
    variables.
  23: CO2 fertilization may increase global grain production in RCP2.6 and 4.5. The
    impact in 2100 is generally stronger than in 2050 for RCP4.5 and 8.5.

Quantitative material:
  3: SSR (Self-Sufficiency Ratio) is used to measure food security by considering
    both production and consumption.
  12: Grain production losses could reach 25% under RCP8.5 by 2100. Bar chart provides
    quantitative estimates of percentage changes in grain production across different
    RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 8.5) for 2050 and 2100, considering temperature (T) alone
    and temperature & precipitation (T&P) together.
  13: Global impacts are small, <2%. RCP8.5 always results in losses. RCP2.6 and 4.5
    result in benefits in 2050 but losses in 2100.
  14: Regional reduction in grain production under temperature change in RCP8.5 scenario
    2100 without and with adaptation is mapped. Several countries' grain production
    is modeled in tonnes.

    maize prices (b) in the RCP8.5 scenario from temperature changes in 2100
  23: Losses in grain output could be 25% of current output in the climate of RCP8.5
    in 2100, but less than 5% if producers adapt well.
