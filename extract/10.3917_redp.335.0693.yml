Drivers of Risk:
  1: Tropical cyclones
  2: Tropical cyclones
Highlights:
  2: National growth responses to cyclone events are heterogeneous given the size
    and the development level of the country; SIDS experience immediate negative impact
    on economic growth from cyclone exposure.
Methodology:
  1: The paper considers the importance of considering Small Island Developing States
    (SIDS) when studying the impact of tropical cyclones on economic growth.
  2: Panel data regression with time and country fixed effects to study the marginal
    cumulative effect over 15 years after a cyclone strike; exogenous and scale-invariant
    predictor of cyclone events is used, adding controls for temperature and precipitation.
More Notes:
  1: The paper was presented at ETEPP 2022 in Aussois, France in March 2022.
  2: Negative impacts in SIDS appear to be driven by an increased dependence on foreign
    economic conditions, insufficient reconstruction capacities and difficulties to
    implement adaptation policies.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic growth
  2: Per capita GDP growth rate
Quantitative material:
  2: Estimated immediate effect of one additional unit of cyclone exposure is to decrease
    growth rates in SIDS by -0.016 percentage point, and this negative effect drops
    to -0.024 percentage point after 15 years; non-SIDS countries experience an increased
    growth in the short-run, which plummets in the long-run, but these results are
    not statistically significant.
