Drivers of Risk:
  1: Future risks are driven by climate change impacts, land-use change, demographic
    shifts, and the accumulation of asset wealth.
  2: Climate change (sea level rise, storm intensity/frequency, extreme temperatures,
    precipitation patterns), population growth, urbanization, and wealth disparities
    are discussed as drivers of future risk.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Increases in population (urbanisation), socioeconomic growth, and choices on
    land use are driving future exposure to natural hazards.
  7: Natural hazards influenced by climate change, economic growth, population size,
    and greenhouse gas emissions
  10: No relevant information
  12: The page mentions climate change impacts like flooding risks and extreme winds
    affecting built infrastructure.
Evaluation overview:
  1: The paper provides an overview of future risks from natural hazards due to climate
    change, urbanization, and demographic changes.
  2: The paper provides an overview of future natural-hazard risk, defining 'risk'
    as the convolution of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Future exposure to natural hazards is being evaluated in terms of potential losses.
  7: No relevant information
  10: No relevant information
  12: The page references coastal risks and the economics of adaptation specifically
    for the Gulf of Mexico, USA.
Highlights:
  1: The review discusses the challenges in risk modeling, with an emphasis on preparing
    for future disasters using strategic policies to mitigate risk.
  2: The paper aims to provide an overview of methods for quantifying and modeling
    risk from natural hazards in the future.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Future exposure to natural hazards will be influenced by increases in urbanisation,
    socioeconomic growth, and fluctuations in land-use choices.
  7: Lack of a commonly accepted analytical framework for complete end-to-end risk
    quantification
  10: No relevant information
  12: Coastal risks in the US Gulf of Mexico are assessed in the context of climate
    change and adaptation strategies.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis focuses on modeling and quantifying future risks by examining individual
    components such as future exposure, physical vulnerability, and natural hazards
    influenced by climate change.
  2: The paper reviews state-of-practice methods and approaches for modeling future
    risk, primarily from a physical sciences and engineering perspective. It considers
    future climate conditions using climate models combined with information on possible
    future scenarios of emissions.
  3: The paper outlines a methodological approach to modeling future climate-related
    hazards, involving emission scenarios, climate models, downscaling, event generation,
    and local intensity calculation. Emission scenarios are used to provide dynamic
    estimates, which are combined with climate models to determine future scenarios.
    Large-scale climate models should be downscaled for the context of interest via
    statistical or dynamic downscaling. Uncertainties are typically incorporated in
    climate change predictions via ensemble modelling. Impact models used to represent
    the physical process that results in the hazard may also have dynamic features.
  4: Future population and economic growth are commonly modelled on the basis of socioeconomic
    scenario storylines. Various downscaling approaches are applied to obtain finer
    resolution data from these storylines. Land-use change is interpreted as urban
    growth.
  7: Challenges of modeling future risks due to uncertainties in climate variability
    and dynamic nature of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability
  9: The paper proposes a stakeholder-centered end-to-end risk modeling framework
    for future natural hazards, accounting for multiple hazards, flexible risk metrics
    (socio-economic and technical), and stakeholder perspectives with feedback loops.
  10: No relevant information
  12: The analysis is performed using climate adaptation engineering, assessing the
    economic impact on infrastructure due to climate change.
More Notes:
  2: The study does not conduct a systematic review. Social vulnerability is broadly
    outside the scope of this study.
  3: Figure 1 provides a visual representation of the methodological approach, adapted
    from Salman and Li (2018).
  7: The paper discusses the interconnectedness of various factors affecting risk
    and emphasizes the importance of methodological frameworks to overcome inconsistencies
    in modeling future risks.

Quantitative material:
  2: Mentions that the total amount of urban land in high-frequency flood zones is
    predicted to increase by 33% compared to 2015 (but this is from another study,
    not this paper).
