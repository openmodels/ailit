  5: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  4: Increases in population (urbanisation), socioeconomic growth, and choices on
    land use drive future exposure to natural hazards.
  5: hazard events (e.g., aftershocks); informal structural modifications; environment-induced
    deterioration; rising carbon dioxide levels.
Highlights:
  5: Discusses the use of models to quantify increasing structural vulnerability over
    time, dynamic increases in structural vulnerability which can be offset by vulnerability
    adaptation measures.
Methodology:
  4: Future population and economic growth are commonly modelled on the basis of socioeconomic
    scenario storylines. Various downscaling approaches exist, including top-down
    (proportional, convergence) and bottom-up (participatory, policy assumptions).
    Land-use change is often interpreted as urban growth and can be modelled using
    cellular automata or agent-based modelling.
  5: Discusses modeling approaches for urban growth simulation including Cellular
    Automata (CA) and Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), Markov chain models, and approaches
    that leverage population and economic growth projections. It also describes assessing
    increasing structural vulnerability using time-dependent fragility models.
  9: Proposes a stakeholder-centered end-to-end risk modeling framework for future
    natural hazards, advancing the conventional risk assessment approach by accounting
    for multiple hazards, a flexible suite of risk metrics that can account for both
    socio-economic and technical networks, and stakeholder perspectives towards different
    dimensions of risk. Feedback loops enable stakeholder perspectives, plans, and
    priorities to be accounted for in the final quantification and selection of risk
    metrics.
More Notes:
  4: The term land-use change can cover a multitude of transitions, such as the abandonment
    or adaptation of agricultural land.
  5: The paper focuses on physical vulnerability of infrastructure and buildings.
    Mentions climate adaptation engineering as a means of shifting vulnerability curves.
  9: The framework emphasizes a holistic approach to risk assessment, considering
    both the physical aspects of hazards and the socio-economic context, incorporating
    stakeholder perspectives into the risk quantification process.
