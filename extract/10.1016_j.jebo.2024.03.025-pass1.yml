    \ published by the People\u2019s Bank of China"
Highlights:
  2: Negative weather shocks lead to persistently low GDP and credit obtained by non-financial
    firms. High credit risk or low confidence among firm managers amplifies the negative
    effects of extreme weather on loans.
  3: Weather shocks have a significant negative impact on the GDP and credit financing.
    After a negative weather shock hits the economy, the GDP and credit obtained by
    non-financial firms decrease.
  4: Weather shocks have a significant and contractionary effect on GDP; Credit is
    an important mechanism for propagating the impact of weather shocks on the real
    economy; Extreme weather reduces loans obtained by listed firms, preceding a drop
    in firm-level output; Expected default risk rises after extreme weather shocks;
    Collateral reduces credit risk following extreme weather.
  5: Credit risk and expectations are important channels through which extreme weather
    affects credit.
  6: "Extreme weather adversely impacts output and credit. Monetary policies should\
    \ adequately address weather shocks. Extreme weather shocks elevate credit risk,\
    \ thus dropping firms\u2019 obtained credit."
  8: The Chinese ACI initially trended downward before rapidly rising after 2015.
    The end of the sampling period saw the highest 5-year average ACI since 2000,
    indicating increasing weather risks.
  9: An Aggregate Climate Index (ACI) is constructed from 1990 to 2020 to measure
    weather risks in China.
  10: Weather shocks have a significant initial impact on GDP, with the largest effect
    seen in the third quarter following the shock.
  11: Weather shocks lead to persistently low economic activities. Short-term monetary
    easing is insufficient for averting the long-term impact of weather shocks on
    credit access. The impact of weather risks on GDP varies over time. The adverse
    effect of weather shocks on GDP between 2001 and 2006 is likely caused by the
    drought indicator being above sample average. Between 2011 and 2015, weather shocks
    had either an insignificant or a positive effect on GDP growth due to low concentrated
    precipitation and extreme low temperature.
  13: Extreme weather shocks have persistent negative effects on aggregate output.
    The central bank should adequately consider the effects of weather shocks when
    implementing monetary policy.  Monetary policy dampens the effects of weather
    shocks on GDP.
  14: The degree of dependence on bank loans varies considerably among the firms.
    Non-SOEs are more likely to be financially constrained and thus more sensitive
    to extreme weather conditions.
  15: Extreme weather reduces bank loans obtained by companies, with a statistically
    and economically significant negative impact on the bank loan to assets ratio.
  16: Extreme weather shocks (ACI) reduce companies' bank loans and increase their
    expected default probability.
  17: Firms with fewer collateral assets face more difficulty obtaining loans after
    extreme weather shocks, and tight monetary policy exacerbates the adverse effects
    of extreme weather on firm-level loans.
  18: Extreme weather has a more adverse effect on bank loans obtained by firms when
    economic policy uncertainty levels and financial stress are high. The drop in
    loans following an extreme weather shock is greater in provinces where local government
    borrowing crowds out corporate borrowing, suggesting that macroeconomic credit
    risk amplifies the negative impact of extreme weather.
  19: Extreme weather dampens market expectations, hindering credit access for listed
    companies. Higher corporate confidence moderates the negative effects of weather
    shocks.
  20: Non-SOE, younger, and smaller firms experience a greater reduction in credit
    financing following extreme weather shocks compared to SOE, older, and larger
    firms, respectively. ACI has an insignificant impact on the primary sector (agricultural)
    listed firms, potentially due to small sample size.
  22: Weather risks, measured through climate indices, negatively impact firm-level
    financing. Strong winds have a curious positive effect on financing. The results
    are robust to different constructions of the climate index, including how extremely
    low temperatures are treated.
  23: Extreme weather shocks have significant and negative effects on GDP and firm-level
    output (value added).
  24: Extreme weather affects credit markets faster (one-quarter lag) than output
    markets (two-quarter lag). The ACI has a statistically significant and negative
    impact on firm's value-added.
  26: Negative weather shocks depress GDP and credit in the long term and lowers the
    interest rate in the short term. Climate risk likely reduces the supply of bank
    loans. The impact of weather shock becomes more severe if monetary policy does
    not loosen after the shock.
  27: Extreme weather has a significant impact on the Chinese economy, particularly
    on the credit access of firms.
  30: Adaptation mitigates the negative effect of temperature shocks on household
    consumption (Lai et al., 2022).
  34: Weather shocks lead to decreases in GDP and credit, variations in interest rates,
    and changes in inflation (CPI).
  35: Around 2020, there's a significant negative spike in GDP deviation, heavily
    influenced by a credit shock.
  36: Monetary policy's reaction to weather shocks can mitigate the negative impact
    of weather shocks on output.
  39: The figure presents the distribution of the estimated coefficients on the ACI
    index of value added regressions from a placebo test, suggesting that the initial
    regressions are unlikely to have randomly produced effects.
  40: ACI shocks explain a substantial portion of the variance in GDP, CPI, Interest
    Rate, and Credit, especially in the short run (Table 1).
  41: Uncertainty indices (GEPU, MPU_US, VIX) significantly impact firm-level ROA.
    Specific estimated coefficients are provided for each model for each variable.
  44: ACI significantly impacts bank loan ratios to total assets, especially when
    interacted with tight monetary policy, economic policy uncertainty, financial
    stress and LGFV bonds. Leverage is insignificant. ACI on its own also has a significant
    negative impact. The control variables, time FE, and firm FE are important.
  47: Firms that are not state-owned, younger, have lower fixed assets, or have lower
    sales experience a greater reduction in access to bank loans (relative to their
    assets) when the ACI is higher.
  48: 'Primary, secondary, and tertiary industries have statistically significant
    negative associations with ACI. '
  49: ACI is significantly associated with changes in long-term and short-term debt
    ratios, and also with interest expenses. The relationship with debt ratios is
    negative, while the relationship with interest expenses is positive.
  50: "Drought, rain, and extreme temperatures (P10, P90) have statistically significant\
    \ negative impacts on ACI_b. Wind has a statistically significant positive impact\
    \ on the loan/asset ratio. Being in the period 1960\u20131989 has a statistically\
    \ significant negative impact on the loan/asset ratio."
  51: There appear to be statistically significant relationships between various measures
    of financial uncertainty (e.g., jumps in credit, US monetary policy uncertainty)
    and macroeconomic outcomes such as GDP and asset values. Also, the impact of tangible
    assets on something referred to as ACI (possibly an asset cost index) is examined.
  52: Higher climate risk (ACI) is associated with lower bank loan ratios and lower
    value added. Excess reserves ratio is associated with lower loan/asset ratios.
    Capital adequacy ratio is associated with higher loan/asset ratios.
  53: The climate risk index (ACI) has a statistically significant negative impact
    on bank loans.
Methodology:
  2: Structural vector auto-regression model is used to analyze macroeconomic data.
    Regression analysis of a panel of firms listed in China is also performed.
  3: A structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model is estimated for ACI, gross domestic
    product (GDP), consumer price index (CPI), interest rate, and total credit obtained
    by non-financial firms, from 2001 Q1 to 2020 Q4. Microeconomic analysis included
    panel regressions of loans obtained, and value-added produced by listed firms
    on the ACI, from the 2006 Q1 to 2020 Q4.
  4: VAR (vector autoregression) analysis at aggregate level; Panel regression analysis
    at firm level; Counterfactual analysis to assess the impact of central bank intervention.
  5: Uses firm-level evidence to complement macroeconomic analysis, emphasizing the
    role of credit in the propagation of weather shocks.
  6: Construction of a Chinese ACI (1990-2020) to estimate economic consequences of
    extreme weather. Macroeconomic and firm-level analyses with counterfactual analysis
    to assess monetary policy responses.
  7: The paper constructs a monthly time series of the Chinese Actuaries Climate Index
    (ACI) using daily climate data from 840 surface stations in China. The ACI components
    include extreme high and low temperatures, concentrated precipitation, drought,
    and strong wind. The data is sourced from the China Meteorological Data Service
    Center.
  8: The paper constructs a Chinese Aggregate Climate Index (ACI) by standardizing
    and aggregating five component variables related to extreme weather (P90, P10,
    R, D, W). Standardization is done using monthly means and standard deviations
    from a reference period (Jan 1990 - Dec 2005). The ACI is calculated monthly from
    1990 to 2020.
  9: An Aggregate Climate Index (ACI) is constructed from 1990 to 2020, based on five
    components and official Chinese meteorological data. The ACI is converted to a
    quarterly ACI by taking the quarterly mean. The ACI is validated against the China
    Climate Risk Index from July 2016 to December 2018.
  10: Analysis is performed using a quarterly five-variable SVAR model, including
    ACI, GDP, CPI, interest rate, and total credit, using a Cholesky decomposition
    to identify weather shocks.
  11: SVAR (Structural Vector Autoregression) model is used. Historical and variance
    decompositions are performed. The variables in SVAR are detrended and demeaned.
  13: Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) analysis with a counterfactual restriction
    that monetary policy does not react to weather shocks.
  14: "Firm-level panel regression with fixed effects, using data on Chinese listed\
    \ companies between 2006 Q1 and 2020 Q4. The regression model is: (loan/asset)i,t\
    \ = \u03B21ACIt\u22121 + \u03B22Xi,t\u22121 + dt + di + \u03F5i,t"
  15: Regression analysis with time- and firm-fixed effects, using a one-quarter lag
    of ACI. The analysis excludes observations from 2008-2009 (global financial crisis)
    and 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic) in sensitivity analysis.
  16: Regression analysis is used to estimate the impact of ACI shocks on bank loans
    and expected default frequency (EDF). A placebo test using artificially resampled
    ACI index is performed to ensure results are not driven by other aggregate events.
    EDF index is constructed at the firm-quarter level.
  17: Analysis includes interaction terms of proxy variables for collateral assets
    with ACI and interactions with tight monetary policy.
  18: Regression analysis to explore the impact of extreme weather on bank loans to
    firms, considering economic policy uncertainty, financial stress, leverage, and
    local government debt as moderating factors. Analysis uses cross-province variation
    in local government debt.
  19: Regression analysis of firm-level ratings by stock analysts on the ACI, and
    regressions with interactions between the ACI and macroeconomic variables (ECI,
    PMI).
  20: Regression analysis examining the impact of ACI on bank loans obtained by listed
    firms, considering firm-level and sector-level heterogeneity.
  22: Regression analysis using alternative climate indexes (ACI_b and ACI_c) with
    different base periods (1960-1989) and treatments of extremely low temperatures.
  23: Regression analysis using macroeconomic data and firm-level data. Specifically,
    a value-added regression is performed using a two-quarter lag of the ACI. Value
    added is constructed using balance sheet and income statement information, with
    some variables imputed.
  24: Regression analysis of firm-level data, including value-added regressions. Placebo
    tests using random resampling of the ACI to check for unobserved aggregate events
    driving results.
  26: SVAR model of ACI, GDP, CPI, interest rate, and total credit from 2001 to 2020.
    Bank-level regressions of loans on ACI, controlling for national loan demand.
  27: Analysis using a panel dataset of Chinese firms from 2006 to 2020.
  34: Analysis using impulse responses to assess effects of weather shocks, with results
    applicable over a 20-quarter horizon.
  35: Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) is used to decompose the deviation of
    GDP from its trend into contributions from exogenous shocks.
  36: Counterfactual analysis of output responses to weather shocks under different
    monetary policy assumptions. Results presented in quarters.
  37: "The paper uses the modesty statistic of Leeper and Zha (2003) to test whether\
    \ offsetting shocks used in a counterfactual analysis are large enough to alter\
    \ agents\u2019 expectations. Critical values for this statistic are -2 and 2."
  39: A placebo test is conducted by randomly assigning the ACI index (presumably
    some climate change related index) across time, and re-estimating a baseline specification
    using the randomized data. This simulation is repeated 500 times.
  40: Variance decomposition is used to assess the impact of ACI shocks on macroeconomic
    variables. Summary statistics are provided for Chinese firms. The variance decomposition
    is applicable at quarterly and longer frequencies.
  41: Panel regressions with Firm and Time Fixed Effects (FEFE). The table contains
    regression results on the effects of different macro variables and policy uncertainty
    on firm-level outcomes, specifically return on assets (ROA), asset level and credit
    to loan ratios. Models appear to test various specifications and control variables.
    The sample includes non-financial firms.
  44: Panel regression analysis with firm-fixed effects, time-fixed effects, and control
    variables as specified in Table 3. A one-quarter lag of ACI is used. The dependent
    variable is the bank loan ratio to total assets.
  47: Panel regression with firm-fixed effects, time-fixed effects, and control variables.
    The analysis uses a one-quarter lag of the ACI.
  48: 'Firm-fixed effects regressions are performed with sub-samples. ACI is the dependent
    variable, and regressions control for time and sector. '
  49: The analysis uses regression models with controls, time fixed effects, and firm-fixed
    effects.
  50: Regression analysis with firm-fixed and time effects (olsFEFE). The results
    are applicable to the period and location in which the data was collected (likely
    a national level study given the request for national level analysis) between
    1960 and 1989 (possibly using this as the baseline, and incorporating climate
    variables).
  51: The study uses panel regressions with firm fixed effects, time fixed effects
    (FEFE), and likely a large dataset (firm N=129213). The regressions include various
    control variables such as firm age, leverage, and size. The results are applicable
    for 2008-2009 and 2020, and potentially other years (YYY).
  52: Regression analysis with firm and time fixed effects and controls.  ACI is lagged
    one quarter for loan regressions and two quarters for value added regressions.
  53: "Regression analysis at the bank level, using a one-quarter lag of the Climate\
    \ Risk Index (ACI), including control variables, time fixed effects, and firm\
    \ fixed effects. Dependent variable is log bank loans reported on listed banks\u2019\
    \ balance sheets."
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on the Chinese economy.
  3: The study uses daily data from the China Meteorological Data Service Center to
    construct the ACI.
  4: The paper focuses on the impacts of weather shocks in China.
  5: This study provides firm-level evidence to complement the macroeconomic analysis
    of the impact of weather shocks on output, emphasizing the role of credit.
  6: Focuses on Chinese firms' credit access due to the dominance of banks in the
    Chinese financial system. Analyzes the impact of climate risk on credit access
    through elevated credit risk and lowered expectations/confidence.
  8: The ACI is based on the premise that a reduction in cold extremes (P10) increases
    weather risks. The paper highlights that September 2019 had particularly high
    P90 (90th percentile of precipitation) and D (drought) values, contributing to
    the maximum ACI value.
  9: The paper mentions comparing the quarterly ACI to quarterly macroeconomic and
    firm-level variables (though this is not done on this page of the paper), indicating
    the study may attempt to quantify macroeconomic impacts of climate.
  11: Figures 2, 5, and 6 are referenced but not included here.
  13: Firm-level panel regressions are used in a later section (not detailed in this
    page) to focus on the mechanisms through which extreme weather's effects propagate
    beyond initial physical damage.
  14: The analysis controls for firm-level assets, firm age, and the fraction of tangible
    assets in total assets.
  15: The R2 value of 0.175 in the initial regression suggests that the ACI and time
    fixed effects account for a significant portion of the variation in loans. The
    estimated impact of extreme weather on credit likely occurs with a lag.
  19: The analysis focuses on listed companies and uses data from the CSMAR database
    and the National Bureau of Statistics of China.
  20: The analysis focuses on listed firms in China.
  22: The original climate index methodology assumed that the absence of extremely
    low temperatures leads to disasters. The authors tested an alternative assumption,
    treating extremely low temperatures as a risk, and found the results to be robust.
  23: The ACI (Aggregate Climate Index) is used as a measure of extreme weather, with
    a robustness check using ACI_d, where the strong wind indicator has a negative
    sign. Firm fixed effects and time fixed effects are included in the value-added
    regression.
  24: The study controls for macroeconomic variables, suggesting the effect of ACI
    on value-added is independent of other macroeconomic events. Sales tax was replaced
    by a value-added tax in 2016.
  27: There is future research potential in quantifying economic consequences of climate
    change and exploring monetary and credit policy responses to extreme weather.
  35: Variables in the SVAR are detrended and demeaned prior to the decomposition.
  36: The figure compares factual and counterfactual scenarios regarding monetary
    policy reaction.
  37: The source of the figure is 'Authors' calculations', indicating the authors
    performed the analysis themselves.
  41: The dependent variable is ACI (potentially an index of something, unspecified),
    tangibleROA (tangible Return On Assets), age, ln(asset) or lever. The analysis
    controls for lagged variables. The sample seems to extend to 2020 based on some
    model specifications, with some model specifications also excluding the global
    financial crisis period of 2008-2009.
  44: The data includes 108225 observations except for column (5) which has 92810
    observations. Significance levels are indicated by *, **, and *** for 10%, 5%,
    and 1% respectively. The dependent variable's mean is 14.842 in columns (1) through
    (4) and 14.842 in column (5).
  47: The definition of ACI is not provided in this page. The control variables are
    the same as in column 2 of Table 3 (unspecified).
  48: The paper uses industry-level data (primary, secondary, tertiary) and includes
    firm-fixed effects. It seems to be analyzing the impact of certain variables on
    ACI (the indicatorColumn) which may be related to asset and loan characteristics.
    The analysis also uses sub-samples. Statistical significance is noted at the 1%,
    5%, and 10% levels.
  49: Dependent variables 'longdebt' and 'shortdebt' are normalized to have a mean
    of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Robust standard errors are used. Significance
    levels are denoted by ***, **, and * at 1%, 5%, and 10%, respectively.
  50: The asterisks (***, **) denote significance levels (likely 1%, 5%, 10%). The
    'Y' entries in the columns could indicate inclusion of fixed effects in the models.
    ACI_b, ACI_c, and ACI_d appear to be different measures (likely indices) related
    to climate risk or adaptation. P10 and P90 likely represent the 10th and 90th
    percentile of some climate variable distribution, which may mean temperature.
  51: The acronym 'ACI' is likely related to asset costs or some form of climate or
    economic indicator. The dependent variables include ACI, tangible assets, ROA,
    firm age, log of assets (ln(asset)), leverage, and GDP growth (GDP). Columns (1)
    through (7) present results from different regression specifications.
  52: ACI+ is an indicator for ACI index above zero.
  53: The regressions control for firm fixed effects and time fixed effects, and include
    other unspecified control variables. ACI has a negative effect even when controlling
    for loan demand.

    starting from the 12th quarter, reaching approximately -0.1%. Interest rate drops
    to -0.1% in the third quarter.
  13: A one-standard-deviation weather shock leads to a -0.42% drop in GDP after 20
    quarters. If the central bank does not react to weather shocks, the drop in GDP
    after 20 quarters is -0.49%.
  14: The mean ratio of bank loans to total assets was 14.84%, with a standard deviation
    of 13.84%. The variable range is 0.11% to 68.20%.
  15: A one-unit increase in ACI causes the bank loans to assets ratio to drop by
    0.232 percentage point (baseline specification). Defining a jump event as when
    a filtered ACI exceeds the mean by 1.65 standard deviations, experiencing an ACI
    jump leads to a drop in the bank loan to assets ratio of 0.374 or 0.568 percentage
    point, depending on the ACI time series used.
  16: ACI shocks reduce companies' bank loans (coefficient estimate of -0.247, similar
    to baseline of -0.232). Baseline coefficient (-0.232) from the real-world sample
    is considerably smaller than that of the first centile (-0.048) of all estimates
    from artificial samples. Weather risks significantly increase the expected default
    probability.
  18: The coefficients of interaction terms between extreme weather and economic policy
    uncertainty, financial stress, and leverage are negative and statistically significant
    (except in one case), indicating a more adverse effect on bank loans. The interaction
    term between extreme weather (ACI) and per capita value of outstanding bonds issued
    by local government financing vehicles (LGFV bond) is negative and significant.
  19: Coefficients in regressions of firm-level ratings on the ACI (Abnormal Climate
    Index) are negative and statistically significant.
  20: The ACI coefficient is negative in interactions with NonSOE, Young, Small-size,
    and Small-sales firms. For primary sector listed firms, the ACI coefficient is
    insignificant with a t-statistic of 1.137.
  22: 'ACI_b coefficient in loan regression: -0.264; ACI coefficient in benchmark
    regression: -0.232; ACI_c coefficient: -0.347'
  23: 'Coefficient of ACI_d in the value-added regression: -0.240; Coefficient of
    benchmark ACI estimate in value-added regression: -0.232'
  24: "A one-unit change in the ACI reduces a firm\u2019s value-added by 0.8%."
  26: A one standard deviation shock to ACI index leads to a 0.5% drop in GDP in the
    third quarter. Weather shocks account for 14.2% of GDP fluctuations in the long
    run. Bank loans drop after an ACI shock.
  30: No specific figures mentioned.
  34: Quantitative impulse response data showing the effects of a weather shock over
    20 quarters.
  35: The y-axis displays the magnitude of the shocks, ranging approximately from
    -0.08 to 0.04, representing the deviation of GDP from its trend.
  36: Output declines by up to 0.6 percentage points in a counterfactual scenario
    where monetary policy does not react to weather shocks.
  37: The graph depicts a 'Modesty statistic', oscillating around zero, with a shaded
    area presumably representing a confidence interval. Horizontal lines at y=0, 1,
    -1 (dashed) and 2, -2 (solid) provide reference levels.
  40: Table 1 provides variance decomposition of GDP, CPI, Interest Rate and Credit
    explained by ACI shocks at different time horizons (1st, 4th, 8th, 16th, and 200th
    quarters). Table 2 provides descriptive statistics of firms in China including
    loan/asset ratio, value-added, sales, asset, tangible assets, return on asset,
    long-term debt, short-term debt, interest expenses.
  41: The table presents regression coefficients and standard errors (in parentheses)
    for various models (1-7). It includes statistical significance indicators (***,
    **, *). R-squared values (R2) are also reported. There appear to be estimated
    coefficients for different drivers of risk on the outcome of firm-level ROA.
  44: Table 6 presents regression results with coefficients and standard errors. For
    instance, the coefficient on ACI*tight MP is -0.371 with a standard error of 0.046.
    The R-squared values are also reported.
  47: The table shows negative and statistically significant coefficients for ACI
    interacted with various firm characteristics, indicating that firms with those
    characteristics (NonSOEs, young firms, low-fixed assets firms, and low-sales firms)
    have lower loan/asset ratios when ACI is higher. The ACI variable alone also has
    a negative and statistically significant coefficient.
  48: Primary, secondary, and tertiary industries are associated with coefficients
    of -0.222 (p<0.10), -0.241***, and -0.216***, respectively, in relation to ACI
    (an indicatorColumn).
  49: ACI has a statistically significant negative effect on the change in long-term
    debt to asset ratio (-0.040***) and the change in short-term debt to asset ratio
    (-0.017***). ACI has a statistically significant positive effect on the log of
    interest expenses (0.030***).
  50: "Coefficients for each climate variable on ACI measures and loan/asset ratio\
    \ (e.g., Wind: 0.123*; Drought: -0.320***; Rain: -0.268***; P10: -0.646***; P90:\
    \ -0.673***; 1960\u20131989: -0.264***) Standard errors are given in parentheses.\
    \ Also reports R-squared (R2) - but this is not clearly attached to a relevant\
    \ regression and would need to be looked for in the full text."
  51: Several regressions are presented with coefficients and standard errors, and
    R-squared values. For example, in column (7), a coefficient of 0.056 is associated
    with some risk factor on assets, with a standard error of (0.027), (0.021), (0.027).
    GDP has a coefficient of 3.362 or 3.363 in some regressions.
  52: 'Table 14: ACI*ACI+ coefficient on loan to asset is -0.292***, on ln(VA) is
    -0.024***; ACI coefficient on loan to asset is -0.086**, on ln(VA) is -0.009***.
    Table 15: ACI coefficient on loan/asset ranges from -0.157*** to -0.238***, depending
    on included controls; Excess reserve ratio coefficient on loan/asset is -0.950***
    (without capital adequacy) and -0.160 (with capital adequacy); Capital adequacy
    ratio coefficient on loan/asset is 0.352** or 0.431**.'
  53: A one unit increase in ACI leads to a -0.015 decrease in log bank loans (significant
    at 1% level) in model (1), and a -0.003 decrease in log bank loans (significant
    at 5% level) in model (2). A one unit increase in demand leads to a 0.001 increase
    in log bank loans (significant at 5% level) in model (2).
