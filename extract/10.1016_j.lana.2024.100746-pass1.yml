Drivers of Risk:
  2: Warming trend across all countries in Latin America; increased exposure to ambient
    temperatures; increased heatwave days; changes in ecosystems leading to increased
    wildfire risk; increased transmission potential for dengue due to climate change.
  3: Weather-related extreme events (floods and landslides)
  4: Heatwaves; Air pollution from fossil fuels; Fossil fuel subsidies; Lack of climate
    finance; Inadequate government involvement; Lack of awareness at the governmental
    level
  5: Combined climatic phenomena (powerful winds and hurricanes) impacting Latin American
    ecosystems, populations, infrastructure and human systems; Climate change increasing
    health risks, particularly for indigenous populations; Fossil fuel use.
  6: "Exposure to warming; Exposure of vulnerable populations to heatwaves; Climate\
    \ suitability for infectious disease transmission; Emissions from agricultural\
    \ production and consumption; Climate change and El Ni\xF1o-Southern Oscillation\
    \ (ENSO)."
  7: Increased exposure of populations to heatwaves due to rising temperatures; Inadequate
    behavioral and social responses to heat stress; Increased heat stress during physical
    activity
  8: Rising temperatures, droughts, heat stress, wildfires.
  9: Climate change influences the transmission potential of vector- and water-borne
    diseases, including dengue fever and vibriosis.
  10: Higher frequency of heatwave days, drought months, increasing ambient temperatures,
    extreme heat events, changes in climatological conditions resulting in more days
    of higher fire danger, increased disease transmission risk by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes
  16: Increased coal usage contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution,
    posing health risks. Dependence on fossil fuels also creates vulnerability to
    international markets and foreign policies. Lack of access to clean fuels for
    cooking leads to household air pollution and associated health problems.
  20: Agricultural CO2e emissions (cow and buffalo meat, dairy products, pig meat,
    poultry, sheep and goat meat, cereals, fruits, vegetables, palm oil, rice, other
    crops); Deforestation driven by commodity-driven deforestation, shifting agriculture,
    forestry, unknown reasons, urbanization, and wildfires; Diets high in red and
    processed meat and dairy products.
  21: Climate change mitigation strategies, particularly dietary shifts away from
    animal-based products and towards plant-based foods, impact human health and the
    planet. Reliance on fossil fuels and polluting energy sources impact climate and
    health outcomes.
  22: Climate change-induced extreme weather events (droughts, floods, wildfires,
    and hurricanes) damage infrastructure and disrupt low-carbon and renewable energy
    production; Decreasing hydropower capacity due to droughts; External stressors
    (e.g., wars and international conflicts) incentivize the use of fossil fuels.
  23: Weather-related extreme events (exacerbated by climate change), heat exposure,
    air pollution.
  24: Exposure to anthropogenic ambient PM2.5 air pollution; Heat-related labour capacity
    reduction; Climate Change
  25: Climate change (weather-related extreme events, heatwaves).
  26: Impacts of climate change on health, ecosystems, infrastructure, and human systems;
    inadequate or absent mitigation and adaptation policies; shifts in event frequency
    and severity.
  30: Extreme heat, increased dengue transmission, floods, and landslides exacerbated
    by anthropogenic climate change.
  31: Inadequacy of existing climate-related public policies; Fossil fuel-based energy
    and transportation systems exacerbating poverty and poor health; Air pollution;
    Energy poverty; Political cycles threatening adequate responses to climate change;
    Precarious housing conditions; Limited access to reliable and clean energy.
Highlights:
  2: Latin American populations are experiencing growing exposure to changing climatic
    conditions, leading to increased heat-related mortality and increased risk of
    diseases like dengue.
  3: In 2022, economic losses due to weather-related extreme events in Latin America
    were US$15.6 billion, which is 0.28% of the region's GDP.
  4: Urgent action needed to implement intersectoral public policies that enhance
    climate resilience across the region; Pressing need to prioritise an energy transition
    that focuses on health co-benefits and wellbeing; Need for increasing climate
    finance by committing to sustained fiscal efforts and engaging with multilateral
    development banks
  5: Latin America is exposed to multiple climate-related hazards, which requires
    monitoring and understanding to inform climate policies that minimize associated
    health impacts, increase climate resilience and improve population health.
  6: Overlapping events of global warming and ENSO may trigger devastating consequences
    to populations, including their health and wellbeing, economies, and the environment;
    there are differential impacts among populations depending on social capacity
    to prepare for and respond to these events.
  7: Exposure to heatwaves has increased significantly for vulnerable populations
    (infants and older adults); The risk of heat stress during physical activity has
    also increased.
  8: Heat-related mortality has increased significantly in Latin America. Population
    exposure to wildfires decreased in most countries despite the increase in the
    number of days with high fire danger.
  9: the coastline suitable for Vibrio spp. transmission has steadily increased over
    the last four decades in Latin America
  10: Climate changes are already affecting the health and wellbeing of people in
    Latin America, leading to higher exposure of vulnerable populations to heatwaves
    and increased mortality.
  16: The share of electricity generation from coal has increased in Latin America.
    Renewable energy sources are increasing but remain a small portion of the overall
    energy mix. A significant portion of the rural population lacks access to clean
    cooking fuels.
  20: Animal-based food products are a major contributor to agricultural CO2e emissions
    in Latin America. Commodity-driven deforestation and shifting agriculture are
    the main drivers of tree cover loss.
  21: Imbalanced diets are a significant cause of mortality in Latin America, linked
    to both low consumption of plant-based foods and high consumption of animal-based
    and processed foods. Reliance on fossil fuels impacts air quality and health.
  22: Climate change challenges climate mitigation efforts in Latin America due to
    extreme weather damaging infrastructure and disrupting renewable energy production,
    especially hydropower; Reduced hydropower generation due to droughts leads to
    increased fossil fuel usage and emissions; Climate change has profound economic
    impacts, including increasing healthcare costs, reducing labour capacity, and
    generating economic losses from damaged infrastructure.
  23: Economic losses from extreme weather events and reduced labor capacity due to
    heat represent significant fractions of GDP in Latin America.
  24: Clean energy investment in Latin America grew to US$58.3 billion in 2022, a
    6.8% increase compared to 2021, and exceeded investment in fossil fuels by 13%;
    In 2020, the total monetised costs of premature mortality due to air pollution
    in Mexico and South America were equivalent to the average income of 6.6 million
    people in the region.
  25: Climate change is costly to countries by affecting assets, lowering labour productivity,
    and increasing the costs of ill-health. Economic losses due to weather-related
    extreme events were especially high in 2022. Latin American countries had net-negative
    carbon prices in 2020, providing a net total subsidy to fossil fuels of US$23
    billion.
  26: News articles including climate change and health-related keywords reached a
    record in 2022 with 1260 articles; social media posts related to health and climate
    change increased by 410% from 2017 to 2022.
  30: Latin America is lagging in the capacity to transition to a zero-carbon future
    and still suffering from the health impacts of overdependence on polluting energy.
  31: Transitioning to healthy, zero-emission energy, healthy food systems, and accelerating
    adaptation would be economically profitable.
Methodology:
  3: Not specified on this page.
  4: Lancet Countdown Latin America report underscores the cascading and compounding
    health impacts of anthropogenic climate change
  5: The Lancet Countdown Latin America tracks the links between health and climate
    change using methodologies from the global Lancet Countdown across five domains,
    including indicators related to heat exposure, wildfires, infectious diseases
    and food insecurity.
  6: The indicator on exposure to warming draws on the 2023 global Lancet Countdown
    report and presents the population-weighted change in temperatures as a proxy
    for population exposure to heat.
  7: Tracks population exposure to heatwaves in Latin American countries based on
    data from the 2023 global Lancet Countdown report; Estimates the risk of heat
    stress during physical activity based on daily ambient temperature, relative humidity,
    intensity of physical activity, and clothing worn.
  8: The analysis uses data from the 2023 global Lancet Countdown report and estimates
    heat-related deaths of people older than 65 years.
  9: "Indicator 1.3: climate suitability for infectious disease transmission \u2013\
    \ headline \uFB01nding: the transmission potential for dengue by Aedes aegypti\
    \ increased by 54% from 1951 \u20131960 to 2013 \u2013 2022."
  10: Data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Food Insecurity Experience
    Scale (FIES) with the frequency of heatwaves days and drought months (SPEI-12)
    using a time-varying panel regression.
  16: The analysis draws on data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the
    WHO Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) database. The Lancet Countdown report
    uses this data to analyze the relationship between energy system transition and
    health outcomes, examining the share of energy sources used for electricity generation.
  20: Analysis of CO2e emissions from local consumption and production of different
    food products; Analysis of tree cover loss by main driver between 2001 and 2022.
  21: Deaths attributable to dietary risk factors are calculated using FAO food balance
    sheets.
  22: Indicators are presented to track the economic impacts of climate change and
    monitor the economics of the transition to zero-carbon economies. Specific details
    on methods and additional analyses are in Section 4 of the Appendix.
  23: The analysis draws from the 2023 global Lancet Countdown report and uses data
    from the Swiss Re Institute. Labour capacity loss is estimated by multiplying
    potential work hours lost across four sectors with the average earnings per hour
    for each country, sector, and year.
  24: Draws from the 2023 global Lancet Countdown report; Provides a monetised valuation
    of the years of life lost (YYLs) due to air pollution; Compares the investment
    in clean energy with investment in fossil fuels
  25: The section draws from the 2023 global Lancet Countdown report and compares
    fossil fuel consumption subsidies and carbon prices to estimate economy-wide average
    carbon prices and revenues. The analysis is applicable to Latin American countries.
  26: Analysis of news articles in leading Latin American newspapers using keywords
    related to "climate change" and "climate change and health" between 2007 and 2022;
    social media engagement analysis using Facebook posts containing pre-selected
    keywords on health and climate change from 2017 to 2022.
  30: Exploratory survey in 12 Latin American countries by the Global Consortium on
    Climate and Health Education in 2023.
More Notes:
  2: Adaptation policies in Latin America are weak, with a pressing need for robust
    vulnerability and adaptation assessments.
  4: Report focuses on Latin America; Climate finance is scarce and strongly depends
    on political cycles; Transitioning to sustainable, zero-emission energy sources,
    fostering healthier food systems, and expediting adaptation efforts promise not
    only environmental benefits but also significant economic gains
  5: The report focuses on 17 countries in Latin America, providing evidence to public
    decision-making with the purpose of improving health and wellbeing of Latin American
    populations and reducing social inequities through climate actions focusing on
    health.
  6: The paper discusses the importance of understanding the potentiating effects
    of multiple and interacting climatic hazards to build climate resilience; It also
    discusses climate-related events like droughts in Central America, heatwaves and
    floods in South America, and dengue fever outbreaks.
  7: The data presented focuses on the period 2013-2022 compared to baseline periods
    (1986-2005 or 1991-2000)
  8: The analysis focuses on health-related impacts of climate change, particularly
    heat stress and wildfires, and their trends in Latin American countries.
  9: The page also references figures in the appendix (A5, A6, A7) that may have further
    relevant information.
  10: Health equity must be a cornerstone of all climate adaptation measures.
  16: The page emphasizes the co-benefits of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable
    energy, including improved health outcomes, reduced dependence on international
    markets, and broader social advantages. The focus is primarily on health implications
    rather than direct macroeconomic or fiscal effects of adaptation.
  20: The information about diet and health co-benefits could be indirectly relevant
    to productivity, but the paper doesn't make this link explicit. The tree cover
    loss figure provides information about deforestation drivers.
  21: The bar charts visually present the percentage of CO2e emissions by product,
    separating consumption and production emissions across different countries in
    Central and South America. Cow and buffalo meat is a major contributor to emissions.
  22: The paper emphasizes the need for climate-resilient development, investment
    in climate-resilient and low-carbon energy systems, and just energy transition;
    It also highlights the interconnection between climate and health, and the benefits
    of addressing them together.
  23: The monetised values for heat-related mortality only consider adults over 65
    years of age. The agriculture and construction sectors experienced the highest
    losses from heat-related labour capacity reduction.
  24: The image is a bar chart that illustrates the lost earnings as a percentage
    share of GDP for various countries in Latin America, segmented by sector. Venezuela
    shows the highest total lost earnings, with a significant contribution from the
    services sector; Most countries have relatively small contributions from the agriculture
    and construction sectors; The services sector generally contributes the most to
    the lost earnings across most countries.
  25: The paper suggests that a transition to a net zero-carbon economy and redirecting
    public spending from fossil fuel subsidies to energy transition and energy equality
    is a way to promote good health and prosperous societies. Low-income populations
    are the most affected when removing fossil fuel subsidies. The rate of clean energy
    investment since 2015 is insufficient.
  26: There is a high degree of uncertainty about the effects of climate change under
    different climate scenarios, especially in less developed areas like Latin America;
    robust and detailed climate projects are needed to reduce uncertainty surrounding
    the health-related costs of inaction.
  30: The page also notes a decrease in Green Climate Fund allocation towards climate
    change and health initiatives in 2022.
