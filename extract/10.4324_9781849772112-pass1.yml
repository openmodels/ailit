Drivers of Risk:
  5: Climate Change, Fertilizer and Irrigation, Technology, Cropland loss, Soil and
    fertility loss, Desertification, Converting Cropland to Other Uses, Water Table
    declines, Rising Temperatures, Water Shortages
  7: Rising temperatures, falling water tables, climate change, paving over cropland
    for cars, energy policy decisions affecting carbon dioxide levels
Highlights:
  7: Climate change is impacting food security through rising temperatures and falling
    water tables. China's grain production decline and increased wheat imports signal
    a potential shift to a world food economy dominated by scarcity. Energy policy
    decisions may have a greater effect on long-term food security than decisions
    made in ministries of agriculture.
More Notes:
  5: The document appears to be a book or report focusing on global food security
    and resource management challenges. While it touches on climate change, the primary
    focus seems to be on food production, land use, and water resources. The relevance
    to macroeconomic risks and adaptation costs/benefits will depend on whether the
    subsequent chapters contain concrete analysis of national-level economic impacts.
  7: The analysis connects seemingly disparate sectors (agriculture, energy, transportation)
    to food security. It also highlights the limitations of relying on historical
    weather patterns for future projections in a changing climate.

  7: Food security, grain production, wheat imports, potential need to import large
    quantities of grain (30-50 million tons a year) and associated 'politics of food
    scarcity'

  7: A 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature leads to a decline in wheat, rice, and
    corn yields of 10 percent; China's grain production dropped by 50 million tons
    between 1998 and 2004; China imported 8 million tons of wheat in 2004.
