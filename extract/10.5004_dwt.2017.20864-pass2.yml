Drivers of Risk:
  1: Population growth, changing consumption patterns, low supply efficiencies, lower
    rates of water reuse and recycling, low energy efficiency in the water sector,
    and the impacts of climate change are the main drivers of risk.
  2: Population growth, changing lifestyles and consumption patterns, increasing food
    demand, prevailing general subsidy system, anticipated climate change impacts,
    and other drivers leading to water scarcity and increased water supply costs.
  6: Rapid population and urbanization growth rates, increasing food demand, prevailing
    general subsidy system, anticipated climate change impacts, unsustainable consumption
    patterns, relatively large water losses, inadequate water recycling and reuse,
    and the continuous deterioration and depletion of groundwater resources.
  7: The existence of a general subsidy system and the lack of effective price-signaling
    mechanisms in water use are drivers of financial burdens and economic inefficiencies
    in the GCC.
  8: Limited surface water resources, deterioration in irrigation water quality, over-exploitation
    of groundwater, heavy mining of deep non-renewable aquifers, absence of a national
    water strategy integrated with a national agricultural strategy, low cost recovery
    of the wastewater sector, lack of water pricing.
  9: Agricultural water consumption driven by traditional irrigation methods (flood
    irrigation), cultivating high water consuming crops (cereals and fodders), unrestricted
    groundwater abstraction rights, absence of water metering and tariff for groundwater
    use in agriculture, potential competition for water resources between industrial
    and other sectors.
  10: Impacts of climate change on water resources
  11: Population growth, per capita water consumption, network losses, wastewater
    generation and collection rates, agricultural areas, irrigation efficiency
  12: Population growth and current water consumption patterns.
  13: Low irrigation efficiencies due to the predominance of traditional methods,
    and high wastewater due to low collection and treatment rates.
Highlights:
  1: The GCC countries face major challenges threatening water sector sustainability,
    including increasing water scarcity and increasing costs for infrastructure and
    service delivery.
  6: Desalination is increasing in GCC countries but is expensive due to energy requirements,
    financial costs of operation, and environmental costs.
  7: The use of energy-intensive desalination technology strains fiscal budgets and
    the environment; low reuse of treated wastewater represents lost opportunities
    in water resource management.
  8: The agricultural sector in GCC countries faces challenges, including limited
    water resources and continuous deterioration in irrigation water quality. Groundwater
    resources are over-exploited by the agricultural sector, leading to quality deterioration.
    There is a conflict between agricultural development policies and available water
    resources.
  9: Industrial sector water consumption is increasing due to diversification policies
    and might compete with other sectors. Traditional irrigation methods lead to significant
    water losses.
  10: Integrating adaptation measures in water planning; promoting R&D; adopting a
    water-energy-food nexus approach
  11: The GCC UWS strategic objectives aim for development and sustainability of water
    resources, efficient water utilization, enhanced municipal water supply security,
    effective water governance, and economic efficiency with financial sustainability.
  12: Under the BAU scenario, the total municipal water supply requirements in the
    GCC countries are expected to increase from 5.7 BCM in 2015 to about 11 BCM in
    2035.
  13: By implementing the GCC UWS strategy, significant water savings, particularly
    in agriculture (29 BCM from 2016 to 2035), can extend the life of non-renewable
    groundwater storage.

    potential to improve water sector sustainability.

    with desalination expansion and groundwater abstraction.

    policies and targets for each GCC country in municipal water supply/wastewater
    and agricultural sectors, comparing results with a BAU scenario. The official

More Notes:
  1: The paper identifies the need for an efficient and sustainable water management
    system in the GCC countries.
  2: The paper mentions heavy financial, economic, environmental, and social costs
    associated with water supply provision but does not quantify these beyond the
    per capita freshwater availability.
  6: The paper highlights the importance of water policy reforms and strong management
    interventions to achieve an efficient and sustainable water management system.
  9: The paper identifies key areas for improvement including volumetric water metering
    and pricing, modernizing irrigation methods, and addressing undefined groundwater
    abstraction rights.

  11: The analysis focuses on the water sector in GCC countries. It includes both

    to be achieved by certain years. The KPIs offer quantitative metrics for measuring
    progress towards the strategic objectives.
  12: The study considers desalination energy requirements and associated GHG emissions
    related to water supply. The study only considers the municipal sector.
