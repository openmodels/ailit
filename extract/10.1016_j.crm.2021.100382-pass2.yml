  3: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  3: Extreme weather events, climate change impacts, cross-border exposure to climate
    change impacts, disruptions to international supply chains, climate impacts on
    human security, exposure of the European financial sector to climate change via
    global chains of securities and financial contracts.
  6: Climate change impacts in key agricultural production regions globally disrupting
    EU27 imports. Dependence on a small number of source countries for key commodities
    (oilseeds, cereals, maize, soybeans, palm oil) increases vulnerability. Disruption
    of maritime transport routes due to climate change.
  8: Climate change (implicitly impacting yields, labour productivity, postharvest
    losses, pests, diseases, precipitation) and extreme weather events (cyclones).
  13: Physical climate shocks to manufacturing firms and other capital-intensive activities
    can lead to substantial losses in the portfolios of actors exposed to them.
  14: Climate triggers such as lack of rainfall in Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay
    lead to droughts, impacting soy production.
  15: Extreme drought in Argentina under SSP3 scenario impacting soy production.
  16: Geographic concentration of risk with dependencies on specific commodities and
    regions, vulnerability to climate-related disruptions in trade, and international
    policy context such as protectionism or risk-sharing.
Highlights:
  3: 'Focuses on macro-scale, risk-focused review of potential impact transmission
    pathways between the European Union (EU) and other world regions across three
    distinct domains of interest: trade, human security, and finance.'
  6: The EU27 is highly import-dependent on fertilizers and fossil fuels. Certain
    agricultural sub-categories (fisheries, oilseeds, stimulants, spices) have large
    import contributions. Imports of agricultural, fertilizer, and forestry products
    have generally increased. Import sources for key commodities (soybeans, palm oil,
    maize) are concentrated in a small number of countries. Maritime routes are crucial
    for EU imports and exports.
  8: Potential impacts to agriculture, fisheries and pastoralism from climate change
    are likely to challenge development progress in affected regions.
  13: The EU financial sector is particularly exposed to climate risks via portfolio
    investments because the main investors in cross-border portfolio investments are
    EU financial actors.
  14: Climate-induced changes in soy production can lead to widespread economic and
    social impacts, affecting international markets, domestic policies, and household-level
    food security.
  15: Multi-regional, escalating cascade of impacts affecting EU supply chains, financial
    interests, foreign policy, and human security concerns.
  16: EU's potential position as a net benefactor from climate change in trade, vulnerabilities
    due to concentration of imports, and implications of international and regional
    connections.
Methodology:
  3: Methodological synthesis of evidence to define potential risk sources; conceptualisation
    via a case study of how cross-border impacts may interact across focal domains;
    literature and data reviews to understand the extent of prior consideration of
    climate-related risk exposure; analysis reveals hotspots of potential risk. Case
    study based on a scenario linked to a historical drought affecting the soy supply
    chain.
  15: Scenario analysis inspired by Shared Socioeconomic Pathway Scenario 3 (SSP3)
    for the year 2050.
  16: Analysis of geographic concentration of risks, macro-level view of risk exposure,
    micro-analysis using the framework provided by Carter et al. (2021), including
    historical impact assessment and scenario modeling.
More Notes:
  3: The paper specifically addresses the potential for cross-border exposure to climate
    change impacts and the transmission of impacts across borders.
  6: Monetary values of imports do not always track changes in mass, suggesting price
    volatility in global trade markets, and the potential for rapid price changes
    in global trade markets.
  13: Longer term debt-linked investments may be thought of as higher-risk given that
    divestment opportunities will be lower in the midst of a crisis.
  15: Cross-border impacts of climate events are insufficiently considered in risk
    assessments.
  16: Complexity of cross-border and cross-domain interactions presents challenges
    for decision-makers; importance of collective intelligence and knowledge co-production
    for effective risk assessment and adaptation.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  6: The paper highlights the importance of food security as a macroeconomic risk,
    and the potential for climate change impacts in certain geographic regions to
    have an outsize impact on the sourcing of important materials.
  8: Rising food prices will potentially impose severe economic hardship on buyers
    and importers.
  13: "Amplified losses from negative climate-risk-related shocks and a substantial\
    \ systemic risk that may impair the EU financial system\u2019s stability."
  16: Vulnerability of the EU to macroeconomic disruptions due to geographical concentration
    of commodity imports and the sensitivity of low-income families to food price
    rises.
Quantitative material:
  6: EU27 import percentages for various commodity groups in 2018, including fossil
    fuels, metals & minerals, and agricultural products. Breakdown of agricultural
    imports, fertilizers, cereals, horticulture, and oilseeds. Concentration of import
    sources, e.g., the ten largest sources comprise 87% of extra-EU imports for oilseeds.
  13: Total extra-EU portfolio investment of EU27 countries amounts to approximately
    9.8 trillion USD.
