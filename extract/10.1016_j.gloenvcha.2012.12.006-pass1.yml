Drivers of Risk:
  5: Transient scenarios representing a variety of relevant uncertainties and their
    development over time;
  7: Climate change, sea level rise, socio-economic developments, dry periods, salt
    intrusion.
  10: Climate change scenarios (Warm) leading to drought/salt intrusion, and societal
    scenarios (Crowd) impacting water demand and infrastructure needs are drivers
    of risk.
Highlights:
  1: The approach helps create adaptive plans for long-term water management, considering
    deep uncertainties about social, political, technological, economic, and climate
    changes.
  4: The Adaptation Pathways map allows visualization of when targets are missed under
    current policy and what actions (A, B, C, D) can be taken. The Scorecard shows
    the relative costs and side effects of each action/pathway. Transfer stations
    to new actions and adaptation tipping points are identified.
  5: Integrated approach includes transient scenarios representing a variety of relevant
    uncertainties and their development over time; different types of actions to handle
    vulnerabilities and opportunities; Adaptation Pathways describing sequences of
    promising actions; and a monitoring system with related contingency actions to
    keep the plan on the track of a preferred pathway.
  10: The study identifies adaptation tipping points, preferred adaptation pathways
    based on different societal perspectives, and socially robust actions that all
    perspectives can agree upon.
Methodology:
  1: The paper proposes 'Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways' for decision-making under
    uncertainty, combining 'Adaptive Policymaking' (a theoretical planning process
    with mitigating and hedging actions) and 'Adaptation Pathways' (an analytical
    approach for sequencing actions based on external developments). It is illustrated
    with a case study.
  4: The paper presents an 'Adaptation Pathways' approach, mapping different sequences
    of adaptation actions over time, combined with a 'scorecard' to present the costs
    and benefits of each pathway. Adaptive Policymaking is employed, designing a dynamic
    adaptive plan.
  7: Scenario planning using four water-related scenarios ('Deltascenarios') based
    on climate and socio-economic projections.
  10: The analysis uses adaptation pathways mapping to explore different adaptation
    strategies based on perspectives (Hierarchist, Egalitarian, Individualist) and
    decision points regarding water management.
More Notes:
  7: The water system in the Netherlands relies on a complex network of rivers, lakes,
    and infrastructure for water storage and distribution, particularly for agriculture
    and preventing salt intrusion.
  10: The adaptation pathways consider actions related to raising or decreasing water
    levels, water use efficiency, and changing crop types. The analysis also considers
    contingency actions, signposts, and triggers for adaptation.
