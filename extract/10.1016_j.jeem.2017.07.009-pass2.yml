Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature changes (seasonal average temperatures and temperature bins)
  3: Temperature affects industrial firms' economic performance, such as profit and
    industrial output.
  4: Temperature changes (both seasonal averages and temperature bins) and other weather
    variables (rainfall, sunshine duration, air pressure, relative humidity, and average
    wind speed) are the primary drivers of risk.
  5: Daily average temperature, rainfall, sunshine duration, air pressure, relative
    humidity, and average wind speed.
  7: Seasonal average temperatures (spring and summer)
  9: Changes in seasonal average temperatures (summer, spring, fall, winter), sunshine
    hours.
  10: Daily average temperature; Rainfall and sunshine duration; Air pressure, relative
    humidity, and average wind speed.
  11: Temperature changes
  12: Temperature variations and climate change, specifically temperature effects
    in different seasons and temperature bins
  13: Daily average temperature.
  14: Higher summer and winter temperatures affecting industry outputs.
  15: Shocks or changes include elevated summer temperatures in high-temperature regions.
  16: Future warming, specifically changes in seasonal average temperatures.
  17: Temperature changes, specifically elevated summer temperatures and lagged temperature
    changes.
Highlights:
  1: "Industrial output is nonlinear in temperature changes; lagged temperature changes\
    \ exert significant impacts on current year\u2019s output; higher summer temperatures\
    \ have larger detrimental effects on output in low-temperature regions than in\
    \ high-temperature regions."
  3: The industrial sector contributes about 43% of China's GDP and is the most important
    economic sector in China, understanding how temperature has affected China's industrial
    output provides useful information for the development of long-term adaptation
    strategies to cope with future climate change. This paper also explores whether
    adaptations have been undertaken in response to high temperatures. The analysis
    also includes sunshine duration to increase the precision of estimated temperature
    effects on output.
  4: "The study aims to estimate the total marginal effect of temperature on output,\
    \ including direct and indirect effects through input productivities, input and\
    \ output prices, and adaptation. The study also wants to examine whether temperature\
    \ has any remaining effects on industrial output, net of firms\u2019 adjustment\
    \ in input use and net of all potential climate adaptations in response to temperature\
    \ changes."
  5: Temperature effects on output are identified from the random variations in temperature
    over time.
  7: Spring temperatures are positively correlated with industrial output, while summer
    temperatures are negatively correlated.
  9: Summer temperatures have a significant negative impact on industrial output.
    The impacts of temperature changes during the spring, fall and winter are typically
    insignificant, but summer temperature impacts are large. Lagged and cumulative
    temperature effects are also significant, with summer and winter temperatures
    in the previous year negatively impacting current output, and spring and fall
    temperatures positively impacting current output. Temperature effect on industrial
    output is nonlinear.
  10: "Relationship between temperature and output is nonlinear and exhibits an inverted-U\
    \ shape when temperature is above 15\xB0C; [21\xB0C, 24\xB0C) is identified as\
    \ a critical temperature threshold, where marginal effects on industrial output\
    \ from temperatures outside this range are negative or zero."
  11: Elevated temperatures in the prior two years can have negative lagged effects
    on current year's industrial output.
  12: Future global warming is expected to lead to a reduction in output due to the
    larger negative effects of summer and winter temperatures compared to the positive
    effects of spring and fall temperatures.
  13: "Low and high temperatures have influenced firms\u2019 investment and inventory\
    \ levels; Low and high temperatures have negative effects on firms\u2019 investment;\
    \ Inventory is positively correlated with temperature; Temperature changes in\
    \ prior years can affect industrial firms\u2019 production in the following years;\
    \ Output is nonlinear in temperature changes and output exhibits negative responses\
    \ to low and high temperatures; There is substantial heterogeneity in the effects\
    \ of temperature on output across industries; Ferrous metal mining, timber, and\
    \ rubber are the three industries affected most by higher summer temperatures;\
    \ Stationary and office machinery are most affected."
  14: Higher temperatures significantly impact output negatively, with adaptations
    taken in high-temperature regions to mitigate these effects.
  15: High-temperature regions seem better at adapting to elevated summer temperatures,
    showing positive effects on output; the temperature effect is statistically significant
    at the 5% level.
  16: The effects of warming on output depend on climate models and warming scenarios.
    The projected increase in summer temperature is identified as the main factor
    causing future output reductions.
  17: Industrial output exhibits nonlinear responses to temperature changes; positive
    effects during spring and negative during summer; high-temperature regions cope
    better with high temperatures.
Methodology:
  1: Firm-level panel data of annual industrial output paired with fine-scale daily
    weather data to estimate the responses of industrial output to temperature changes
    in China.
  3: "Develops a simple framework to illustrate the mechanisms through which temperature\
    \ affects industrial firms\u2019 economic performance, such as profit and industrial\
    \ output."
  4: 'The paper uses panel data regression with firm fixed effects, industry-year
    fixed effects, and lagged weather variables to estimate the impact of temperature
    on industrial output. Two approaches are used: seasonal average temperatures and
    temperature bins.'
  5: The paper uses a panel regression model with firm and year fixed effects to identify
    the temperature effects on output from random variations in temperature over time
    from 1998 to 2007 in China, accounting for spatial and serial correlation of error
    terms by clustering standard errors within firms and prefecture-level city-years.
  7: Regression models with firm fixed effects and two-digit industry/year fixed effects,
    using both contemporaneous and lagged (up to four years) weather variables. Data
    covers the period 1998-2007.
  9: Regression analysis using seasonal average temperatures and sunshine hours as
    explanatory variables for industrial output in China. Models include lagged temperature
    variables to assess delayed impacts. Analysis is performed at the county level.
    Use of four lags.
  10: Regression analysis using temperature bins as temperature variables, including
    linear and quadratic forms of sums of rainfall and sunshine duration and means
    of air pressure, relative humidity and average wind speed; incorporates firm fixed
    effects and two-digit industry/year fixed effects; standard errors clustered within
    firms and within prefecture-level city-years.
  11: Regression analysis using temperature bins as temperature variables, controlling
    for rainfall, sunshine duration, air pressure, relative humidity, and average
    wind speed, firm fixed effects, and two-digit industry/year fixed effects.
  12: Panel data analysis using firm-level data from China, employing fixed effects
    models and dynamic panel data approaches. Robustness checks include varying error
    clustering, including region-year fixed effects, altering sample inclusion criteria,
    using weekday-only weather data, using a balanced sample, aggregating to county-industry-year
    level, and using a dynamic panel data approach. The baseline analysis uses temperature
    data from 820 weather stations. Temperature effects are estimated using both seasonal
    average temperatures and temperature bins.
  13: "Panel methodology is used to explore possible channels through which temperature\
    \ in prior years might affect current year\u2019s output; Regressions use temperature\
    \ bins as temperature variables and incorporate linear and quadratic forms of\
    \ sums of rainfall and sunshine duration and means of air pressure, relative humidity\
    \ and average wind speed as additional weather variables; All regressions incorporate\
    \ firm fixed effects and two-digit industry/year fixed effects, and do not include\
    \ lagged values of the weather variables; Standard errors are clustered within\
    \ firms and within prefecture-level city-years."
  14: Estimations based on Eq. (2), including various weather variables and firm and
    year fixed effects, with standard errors clustered within firms and prefecture-level
    city-years.
  15: The analysis uses regression to estimate the effect of summer temperature on
    output, utilizing a model with firm fixed effects and two-digit industry/year
    fixed effects, incorporating weather variables and lagged effects.
  16: "The study calculates projected changes in seasonal average temperatures using\
    \ the ClimateWizard database. These temperature changes are then used with coefficient\
    \ estimates of the cumulative temperature effects on output to compute firm-specific\
    \ predicted changes in output, weighted by each firm\u2019s share in total output."
  17: The analysis uses a firm-level panel of annual industrial output combined with
    a fine-scale daily weather data set to assess the impacts of temperature changes
    on industrial output in China.
More Notes:
  1: The study suggests that adaptation to warming may have been actively undertaken
    in high-temperature regions in China.
  3: The framework considers how temperature affects market prices of output and inputs,
    and input productivities. A firm's adaptation effort is included as a factor dependent
    on temperature.
  4: The analysis focuses on industrial firms in China and controls for simultaneous
    variations in other weather variables. Value added is the difference between total
    output and intermediate input.
  5: The analysis uses firm-level industrial output data from the Annual Survey of
    Industrial Firms database and daily weather data from the CMDSSS for China.
  7: The study focuses on China's industrial sector. The paper mentions weather variables
    are highly correlated during the sample period. The spatial distribution of weather
    stations and industrial value added are presented.
  9: Excluding sunshine hours leads to biased parameter estimates of temperature variables.
    The impact is larger than those obtained using macro-level data. The large magnitude
    of the summer temperature effect is partly explained by small within-group standard
    deviations of summer temperatures. Using seasonal average temperatures is more
    informative than using annual average temperatures.
  10: Analysis uses firm-level data set aggregated to county-level. Also considered
    the impact of higher winter temperatures on labor force composition. Results suggest
    higher winter temperatures increase the share of female workers and reduce the
    share of male workers.
  12: The paper finds that output can be affected by temperature changes in prior
    years, consistent with some literature.
  13: The paper uses seasonal average temperatures as temperature variables for analyses
    conducted in Sections Heterogeneity in the temperature effects across industries,
    Adaptation to high temperatures and Impacts of future climate change.
  16: The authors state that the estimated climate impacts on industrial output are
    likely larger than the actual damage caused by global warming in the long term.
