Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature; climate conditions
  2: The paper focuses on weather and climate conditions on various time scales, including
    short-term weather shocks and long-term climate changes.
  3: Annual temperature shocks, long-run temperature levels (climate), and precipitation
    are drivers of risk. The focus is on temperature.
  4: "Changes in temperature and precipitation (\u0394T), and levels of temperature\
    \ and precipitation (T), are considered drivers of risk."
  6: The shocks impacting outcomes are annual mean temperature and annual total precipitation,
    derived from the CRU TS v3.23 dataset. They also include projections of temperature
    change until 2099 based on the RCP 8.5 scenario.
  7: "The drivers of risk include annual mean temperature (Ti,t), change in annual\
    \ mean temperature (\u0394Ti,t), annual total precipitation (Pi,t), and change\
    \ in annual total precipitation (\u0394Pi,t)."
  8: "Annual mean temperature and annual total precipitation are denoted by T and\
    \ P, respectively. \u0394 T and \u0394 P refer to annual changes in weather and\
    \ L. indicates lagged effects."
  9: "The drivers of risk are changes in temperature (\u0394T) and precipitation (\u0394\
    P), both contemporaneous and lagged."
  10: Annual average temperature change; precipitation
  11: Changes in 10-year average temperature and precipitation, initial GRP, cumulative
    oil and gas production, distance to coast/river, and altitude.
  12: Temperature (T) and Precipitation (P) are considered as drivers, though the
    effect of precipitation is later disregarded due to insignificance.
  13: Temperature increases (global warming), precipitation levels
  15: Warming, specifically under the RCP8.5 scenario. Initial temperature levels
    (Ti,0) over regions.
  16: The driver of risk is changes in global mean surface temperature.
  17: "Temperature increases (1\xB0C)."
  18: Changes in annual mean temperatures, weather shocks.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Economic production; productivity levels and productivity growth
  2: This paper aims to analyze the impact of climate change on economic outcomes,
    specifically Gross Regional Product (GRP).
  3: Economic growth (GDP) and labor productivity are evaluated.
  4: The paper evaluates the impact of temperature and precipitation on per-capita
    growth rate of gross regional product (GRP).
  6: The paper evaluates the impact of climate on economic activity, specifically
    using annual Gross Regional Product (GRP) as a measure of economic activity at
    the subnational level.
  7: The paper evaluates the impact of climate variables (temperature and precipitation)
    on per-capita growth rate (gi,t) and Gross Regional Product (GRP).
  8: Effect of annual weather (changes) on annual changes of log Gross Regional Product.

    on Gross Regional Product (GRP).
  10: Economic growth
  11: Economic growth (changes in log GRP between two periods).
  12: Effect of changes in long-term climate conditions on the log of Gross Regional
    Product.
  13: Global Gross Regional Product (GRP) reductions
  15: GRP (Gross Regional Product) losses in 2099 under a business-as-usual warming
    scenario.
  16: The paper evaluates the impact of temperature changes on global GDP and estimates
    the social cost of carbon (SCC).
  17: GRP losses due to temperature increases.
  18: Economic output and growth rates, gross regional product (GRP).
Highlights:
  1: Temperature affects productivity levels considerably; no evidence for permanent
    growth rate impacts
  2: The paper aims to shed light on whether temperature effects on the economy are
    temporary or persistent (level-vs.-growth effects).
  3: GRP responds to annual temperature shocks as well as long-run temperature levels.
    Marginal effects of temperature increase are much higher than assumed in most
    Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), and hot regions are more strongly affected
    by further warming than cooler regions.
  4: The paper emphasizes differentiating between temperature effects and temperature
    change effects for understanding growth dynamics.
  7: The effect of precipitation changes on GRP is largely insignificant. A significant
    negative effect of temperature increase on GRP is found.
  8: "The marginal effect of an increase in temperature (change), conditional on the\
    \ average temperature in that year (or the previous year), is negative for high\
    \ average temperatures. At 10 \xB0C the marginal effect is insignificant but at\
    \ 25 \xB0C it is mostly significant (at 10% or higher) and amounts to 2.6%\u2013\
    3.7%."
  9: Transitory effects of temperature changes comprise up to two years. The preferred
    model reports higher marginal effects of temperature increases on GRP than Burke
    et al. (2015). Long-difference regressions do not provide evidence for long-run
    growth effects of climate conditions.
  10: "Temperature coefficient is remarkably stable and, except for the earliest period\
    \ (1955\u20131964), significant at the 10%-level."
  11: "Regions with hot climates tend to have lower GRP. A u-shaped pattern is found\
    \ for precipitation, implying high GRP in very dry and very wet regions. Marginal\
    \ effects (ME) at 10\xB0C and 25\xB0C are also provided for some model specifications."
  12: Temperature has a statistically significant negative impact on Gross Regional
    Product in cross-sectional regressions.
  13: Damages inferred from the annual panel model are larger than those from the
    cross-sectional model. Cold regions may benefit from warming, while hot regions
    lose disproportionately in the panel approach. Poorer regions tend to suffer stronger
    from global warming.
  15: Projected losses are on average highest in those regions that have the lowest
    baseline GRP levels. Panel based damages exceed the DICE damages by a factor of
    two or more. Social cost of carbon is almost four times higher as assessed by
    Nordhaus in 2018.
  16: The study finds that damage functions derived from cross-sectional results yield
    SCC values that are twice as high as those computed in Nordhaus (2018) in 2020.
    The study finds strong evidence that output levels are affected after a one-time
    temperature increase but does not find evidence that long-run balanced growth
    rate is affected.
  17: Technological change has not reduced the temperature sensitivity of economies.
  18: "Increases in temperature tend to increase GRP in cold regions (below 5\xB0\
    C) and reduce GRP in hot regions; a permanent increase in temperature will lead\
    \ to a permanent loss in economic output in hot regions; technological change\
    \ has not weakened the temperature-sensitivity of economies."
Methodology:
  1: Annual panel models, long-difference regressions and cross-sectional regressions
    using a novel data set of subnational economic output (Gross Regional Product)
    for more than 1500 regions in 77 countries.
  2: The paper uses a panel of subnational GDP data (GRP) covering more than 1500
    regions. It seeks to address shortcomings of previous analyses with respect to
    regional scope, temporal scale and specific technical issues.
  3: The paper uses panel, long-difference, and cross-sectional estimates. The conceptual
    framework uses a stylized Ramsey-type growth model.
  4: The paper uses a panel regression model (Eq. 6) with region-specific polynomial
    time trends, region fixed effects, and year fixed effects to analyze the relationship
    between weather (temperature and precipitation) and per-capita GRP growth. It
    compares different model specifications to isolate different channels of climate
    impact.
  6: "The analysis uses climate and economic data at the subnational level for the\
    \ years 1900\u20132014. Gridded climate data at 0.5\u25E6 resolution from CRU\
    \ TS v3.23 is aggregated to the region level using area-weighted averages. Temperature\
    \ projections for 2015\u20132099 are derived from ISIMIP data, bias-corrected,\
    \ and aggregated to the region level."
  7: The paper uses annual panel data, long-difference data, and cross-sectional data.
    Regression models are employed to estimate the effects of climate variables on
    GRP. The annual panel model uses data from 35,283 observations across 1545 regions
    over 22.837 time periods. Long difference and cross sectional models are limited
    to the period 1985-2014.
  8: Panel regression analysis using annual data from 1900-2014 or 1980-2014 for 77
    countries and 1545 regions. Models include fixed effects for region and year,
    a regional trend (squared), and standard errors clustered at the country level.
  9: The analysis uses panel regressions with various lag structures (up to one year
    appears most relevant), long-difference models (comparing 10-year periods), and
    cross-sectional models. The panel regressions consider contemporaneous and lagged
    temperature changes. The long-difference models compare changes in GRP and climate
    variables between different 10-year periods. The cross-sectional model investigates
    how prevailing climate conditions affect GRP.
  10: "Climate and GRP data are aggregated to 10-year intervals with 2005\u20132014\
    \ as reference period. Temperature coefficient is remarkably stable over all decades."
  11: Long-difference regression model comparing different time periods (1995-2004
    to 2005-2014, and 1985-1994 to 2005-2014). Country fixed effects are included
    and standard errors are clustered at the country level.  Models also explore non-linear
    relationships using temperature and precipitation bins.
  12: 'Cross-sectional regressions are performed using climate and GRP data aggregated
    to 10-year intervals. Future economic losses are projected based on historic GRP-climate
    relationships, considering a business-as-usual scenario. Impacts are aggregated
    globally using different weighting methods: unweighted, land-surface area weighted,
    output (GRP) weighted, and population weighted.'
  13: Cross-sectional regressions with binning of climate variables (temperature and
    precipitation) are used. Panel estimates are also used, incorporating an interaction
    term.
  15: Panel and cross-sectional regressions are used to estimate the relationship
    between baseline GRP per capita and change in log GRP. Approximate reduced-form
    global damage function estimated with a quadratic form. Damage functions calibrated
    using surface area-weighted global warming, output-weighted global damages, and
    population-weighted global damages.
  16: The study uses panel and cross-sectional regressions to derive damage functions
    that map temperature increases to changes in global GDP. The damage functions
    are calibrated to replicate output- and population-weighted global damages.
  17: "Marginal effects at 25\xB0C are given for non-linear annual panel specifications."
  18: Stylized growth model to illustrate how weather shocks and changes in climate
    affect economic output and growth rates; regression models at subnational level
    with almost global coverage, analyzing the climate-growth nexus at various time
    scales; annual panel model; long-difference regression model; cross-sectional
    model on per-capita GRP with country fixed effects.
More Notes:
  1: Excludes non-market damages and damages from extreme weather events or sea-level
    rise.
  3: The framework disregards explicit adaptation choices, damages to capital stocks,
    or labor supply responses.
  4: The paper acknowledges potential collinearity issues between temperature levels
    and changes, particularly when lags are included, which complicates the identification
    of different impact channels. The paper investigates changes in annual total precipitation
    analogously to changes in temperature.
  6: The study uses a unique dataset of over 1500 regions in 77 countries. ERA5 reanalysis
    data is used as a robustness check. The paper addresses structural breaks in the
    GRP data with dummy variables. Geographic variables like distance to rivers/coasts
    and altitude are also considered.
  7: Differences in mean temperature levels between Table 1 and Tables 2 and 3 are
    related to differences in spatial and temporal coverage due to how missing GRP
    data are handled.
  8: Comparison of model variants suggests temperature changes affect transitory or
    long-run growth. Find strong evidence for direct productivity effects of temperature
    shocks.
  10: Fossil resource extraction increases GRP, whereas higher values for distance
    to coast, distance to navigable rivers, and altitude reduce GRP. Altitude is negatively
    correlated with temperature. The temperature results are robust against the inclusion
    of geographical covariates (except altitude).
  11: Using ERA5 climate data leads to temperature coefficients of similar magnitude.
    Restricting to larger regions only shows minor differences.
  12: The analysis projects future economic losses and calculates the social cost
    of carbon based on empirical estimates from the historic GRP-climate relationship.
  13: A reduced-form damage function is derived to map global warming to global GDP
    losses, intended for implementation in integrated assessment models like the DICE
    model.
  15: A parsimonious damage function suitable for use in integrated assessment models
    such as the DICE model cannot be derived from our panel approach. Log damages
    are linear in the cross-sectional regression.
  16: The SCC estimates only include direct total factor productivity (TFP) impacts
    of temperature changes and do not account for sea-level rise or non-market effects.
  17: Estimates primarily cover impacts on labor productivity, land productivity (agricultural
    yields), and depreciation of capital. Non-market damages such as loss of life,
    conflicts and violence, biodiversity and ecosystem damages, and sea level rise
    are not captured.
Quantitative material:
  1: "A 3.5 \u25E6C increase in global mean surface temperature would reduce global\
    \ output by 7\u201314% in 2100; social cost of carbon from temperature-induced\
    \ productivity losses is 73\u2013142$/tCO2 in 2020, rising to 92\u2013181$/tCO2\
    \ in 2030."
  3: The paper provides estimates of GDP losses under a business-as-usual warming
    scenario.
  4: "The paper aims to test how sudden changes in climate (\u0394T) affect contemporaneous\
    \ growth rates, conditional on prevailing climate conditions (T), and how prevailing\
    \ climate conditions affect transitory and long-run growth."
  6: Average annual per-capita growth in USD is 7%. Standard deviation of inter-annual
    temperature variation within a region is 0.67, compared to spatial variability
    of long-term temperature of 8.204.
  8: "At 25 \xB0C a temperature increase of 1 \xB0C in a hot region decreases GRP\
    \ by about 3%."
  9: "Adding one-year lagged weather changes increases R2-adjusted and BIC considerably\
    \ compared to regressions with zero lags. The temperature increased by only 0.46\
    \ \xB0C on average between the periods 2005\u20132014 and 1985\u20131994. The\
    \ standard deviation of the within-country temperature change was only 0.39 whereas\
    \ the standard deviation of within-country temperature levels for the period 2005\u2013\
    2014 was 3.83."
  10: "One degree of temperature increase reduces GRP by 2\u20134%."
  11: "Coefficients from long-difference regression models are provided, showing the\
    \ effect of changes in 10-year average weather on economic growth. E.g., \u0394\
    T (change in temperature) has a coefficient of 0.0284 in column (1) with a standard\
    \ error of (0.0387)."
  12: "Cross-sectional regression results show the effect of changes in long-term\
    \ climate conditions on the log of Gross Regional Product. Regions\u2019 annual\
    \ GRP is on average reduced by around 6-8% at the end of the century compared\
    \ to a no warming scenario using cross-sectional estimates and business-as-usual\
    \ climate change mitigation scenario."
  13: Global GRP reductions in 2099 for the RCP 8.5 warming scenario are estimated
    to be between 6.6% and 8.1% based on cross-sectional estimates and between 11.4%
    and 14.2% based on panel estimates, depending on the weighting scheme used.
  15: "Estimates of change in log GRP in 2099. \U0001D6FD =\u2212 0.0018 (quadratic\
    \ coefficient).  \u0303\U0001D6FC =\u2212 0.035 (output-weighted).  \u0303\U0001D6FC\
    \ =\u2212 0.0373 (population-weighted)."
  16: The paper provides estimates for the social cost of carbon (in $/tCO2, in 2010-US$)
    for different damage functions and years (2020, 2030, 2050, 2100) based on cross-sectional
    and panel estimates.
  17: Cross-sectional models predict GRP losses of 2.0-4.3%.
  18: "A 1 \xB0C temperature increase in a region with an annual mean temperature\
    \ of 25 \xB0C, reduces GRP by about 3.5% in that region; projected production\
    \ losses of around 7\u201314% in the year 2099 compared to a scenario of no further\
    \ warming; output losses of up to 20% are possible in tropical regions; the social\
    \ cost of carbon more than triples compared to what the original DICE-2016 damage\
    \ function suggests by incorporating the panel regression model damage function."
