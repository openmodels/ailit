Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change will dramatically slow and redistribute growth in the coming decades.
  2: "Temperature increases leading to reduced productivity, particularly in countries\
    \ with average annual temperatures above 13\xB0C."
  4: Temperature effects of climate change.
  5: Reduced global economic growth and environmental issues such as climate change
    effects like sea-level rise and potential deglobalization.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change is likely to dramatically slow the global economic growth rate
    and change the distribution of growth among countries, impacting future information
    systems and digital innovation.
  2: By 2099, 113 countries are projected to be below +0.5% annual growth, and 65
    will be contracting at a rate of 1.5%/year or greater.
  4: Climate change is projected to cause negative economic growth and reduced GDP
    per capita in Vietnam, China, Malaysia, and the Philippines by 2099, potentially
    reducing their role in ICT goods exporting. Northern and Eastern Europe are well-positioned
    to grow in future ICT goods exporting.
  5: The idea that reduced economic growth could lead to decreased innovation in ICT
    systems and potentially reach a 'peak ICT' scenario.
Methodology:
  1: Quantitative analyses to project the effects of climate-change-adjusted economic
    futures on information systems; Theory of frugal innovation and retreat of innovations
    accompanying quantitative analyses
  2: Performed additional analyses on data from Burke et al. [11] to project national
    GDP growth rates under climate change scenarios.
  4: Analysis of economic futures projected by Burke et al., focusing on ICT exports
    and GDP per capita, examining countries with established ICT export capabilities
    and strong economic prospects in the future (until 2099).
More Notes:
  2: The paper highlights the potential for widening global inequality due to climate
    change, with countries near the equator being disproportionately affected.
  4: The analysis is based only on the temperature effects of climate change and does
    not account for other factors like sea-level rise. Also, the raw materials for
    ICT production come from regions slated to suffer the worst effects of climate
    change.
  5: The paper suggests innovation must adapt in resource-constrained environments
    and questions the traditional diffusion theory of innovation in declining contexts.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Explores how decreased and redistributed global growth may impact future information
    systems and digital innovation.
  2: Average global incomes in 2100 will be 23% lower than they would have been without
    climate change.
  4: GDP per capita, economic growth rates.
  5: The paper discusses a potential dramatic decrease in GDP growth in the 21st century
    and its implications for innovation and ICT systems.
Quantitative material:
  1: Engage in quantitative analyses to project the effects of climate-change-adjusted
    economic futures on information systems across different countries.
  2: 77% of countries will have their per capita income reduced compared to levels
    in a future without climate change by the end of the century.
  4: Vietnam's growth rate peaks at 6.3% in 2015 and turns negative in 2067; Malaysia
    peaks at 3.6% in 2025 and turns negative in 2059; The Philippines peaks at 5.0%
    in 2030 and turns negative in 2075; China's growth rate is 8.4% in 2011 and turns
    negative in 2096. Vietnam is projected to fall 30 spots to 162nd in GDP per capita
    ranking by 2099; China will gain 13 spots to 90th; Malaysia will fall 61 spots
    to 119th; the Philippines will fall 14 spots to 126th.
