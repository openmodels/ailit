Drivers of Risk:
  3: Drought, specifically water storage deficits as measured by the Water Storage
    Deficit Index (WSDI).
  4: Drought events in the Pearl River Basin.
Highlights:
  3: The study monitors drought events in the Pearl River Basin using WSDI derived
    from GRACE satellite data. The analysis identified 7 drought events between 2002
    and 2017.
  4: WSDI is well-correlated with SPI-6, SPI-12, SPEI-6, SPEI-12, SRI-3, SRI-6, SRI-12,
    and scPDSI. scPDSI has the highest correlation with WSDI.
Methodology:
  3: The study uses GRACE satellite data to calculate the Water Storage Deficit Index
    (WSDI). The WSDI is calculated from TWSD data (derived from JPL and CSR). The
    methodology involves calculating the mean and standard deviation of TWSD time
    series to determine WSDI. Drought events are defined as three or more consecutive
    months with negative WSDI values. Drought severity is quantified by integrating
    WSDI values below zero. Drought characteristics such as duration, intensity, and
    severity are analyzed.
  4: Compares WSDI with other drought indices (SPI, SPEI, SRI, scPDSI) using Pearson
    correlation coefficients. Analyzes drought events monitored by WSDI and compares
    them with records from the Pearl River Water Resources Commission.
More Notes:
  3: The study mentions the use of different drought classification standards (D0-D4)
    based on WSDI values, referencing McKee et al. [35].
  4: The study focuses on the Pearl River Basin. The analysis period is from 2002
    to 2015. The paper mentions the impact of drought on specific regions and years
    (e.g., 2010, 2011, 2013).

  1: This page focuses on drought monitoring using GRACE satellite data and does not
    contain information on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, costs, benefits, or adaptation
    strategies at a national level.
  8: No relevant information
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: No relevant information
  4: Mentions drought severity and area affected by different drought types (D0-D3).
Quantitative material:
  3: The study finds a WSDI change rate of 0.13/year in the Pearl River Basin. It
    monitors 7 drought events between April 2002 and June 2017 using WSDI.
  4: Table 2 lists drought events with duration, intensity, and severity. Table 3
    presents correlation coefficients between WSDI and other drought indices (SPI,
    SPEI, SRI, scPDSI). Figure 2 shows the area ratio affected by different types
    of drought (D0-D3). Figure 3 shows the changes of WSDI and scPDSI from 2002-2015.
