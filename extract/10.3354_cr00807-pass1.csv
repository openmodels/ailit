0,Agricultural,Adaptation,Argentina,Decreasing precipitation,Economic profits per hectare,MonetaryBenefits,Economic,Need,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Abstract,"The abstract mentions that in Pergamino, crop economic returns would not change noticeably with decreasing precipitation, while Pilar would experience a marked decrease in profits and an increase in production risks, however, potential negative impacts might be mitigated, in part, if farmers adapt their agronomic management using current available technology or know-how. There are no specific quantitative values on the page, so a placeholder of 0 is used."
