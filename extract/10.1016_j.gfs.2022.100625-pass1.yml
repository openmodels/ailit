Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate-related hazards (droughts, forest fires, floods, extreme rainfall, landslides,
    cyclones, extreme temperatures, sea level rise).
  4: Droughts, cyclones, extreme rainfall, extreme temperature, forest fire, floods,
    landslides, and sea-level rise.
  5: Combined climate hazards, interstate trade/imports
  7: Climate disasters (simultaneous or sequential), climate change increasing frequency
    and intensity of hazards, COVID-19 pandemic, sub-national hazards.
Highlights:
  1: Climate hazard risks to food supply vary across states and by hazard type. Largest
    risks are in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Assam, mainly to local production. Food
    supply in each state is at risk from all eight climate hazards via imports. 14
    states have greater risk for imported food supply than local. Five states contribute
    to more than half of climate hazard risk in interstate food trade.
  4: Droughts present a greater risk to Indian food supply than other climate hazards,
    while landslides and sea-level rise present the lowest risk.
  5: Northern and central states of India tend to be at higher risk of climate hazards
    to their per capita food supply. Some states have a high percentage of food supply
    risk attributable to imports.
  7: Climate disaster occurring simultaneously across Indian states may have a greater
    effect on national food supply than climate disaster occurring sequentially.
Methodology:
  1: Risk assessment using hazard presence, vulnerability, and volume of per capita
    food supply exposed to hazards. Supply and demand balance model for 30 major food
    items using government data from 2011-12 to estimate food supply source.
  4: The study quantifies climate hazard risk to food supply by considering risks
    at the food supply source, using the BAMMtools package in R for heatmap generation.
    Natural jenks is used to color-code risk in the heatmap. The analysis covers the
    period 2000-2020 for the climate hazard data.
  5: Analysis of climate hazard risk to food supply and interstate trade using the
    circlize package in R studio
  7: Assessed hazard presence in the total land area of the state; used HDI as a composite
    indicator of vulnerability; used supply and demand balance model centered on the
    year 2011-12. The risk values presented in this study should be considered as
    baseline estimates that will require updating when more recent data on food trade
    become available.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on India and the potential effects on national food supply,
    affecting both local production and interstate trade.
  4: The study focuses on food supply risk and does not directly quantify macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes, but it provides a basis for understanding potential economic
    impacts related to food security. The spatial scale is at the state level within
    India.
  5: The analysis focuses on the impact of climate hazards on food supply at the state
    level in India, considering both internal risks and risks associated with interstate
    trade dependency.
  7: Focuses on current climate hazard risks, but acknowledges the increasing frequency,
    intensity, and exposure to hazards due to climate change. The study also acknowledges
    that the areas exposed to hazards may not overlap with agricultural areas or food
    supply chains, particularly for larger states.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Impacts on national food supply (both local production and interstate trade).
  4: The paper focuses on climate hazard risk to food supply, which is implicitly
    linked to macroeconomic outcomes through potential impacts on food security and
    prices.
  5: Per capita food supply risk
  7: National food supply, domestic food prices, export volumes, food security.
