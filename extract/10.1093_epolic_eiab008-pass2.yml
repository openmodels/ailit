Drivers of Risk:
  2: Shocks impacting dirty energy usage (carbon emissions), the relationship between
    carbon concentration and temperature, and the connection between temperature and
    damages
  3: 'Three distinct mean-zero, symmetric shocks: dirty energy usage, relationship
    between CO2 emissions and temperature, climate-damage function parameter'
  5: Shocks to the climate system and the macro-economy, climate tipping point
  6: Climate risks; adverse future shocks; use of dirty energy; potentially very adverse
    future shocks.
  7: CO2 emissions from dirty energy use, temperature increases, shocks to dirty energy's
    share in the production function.
  8: Dirty energy usage shock; Shocks to the climate-sensitivity parameter; Stochastic
    damage function parameter governing tipping point probability.
  9: Uncertainty about dirty energy usage (CO2 emissions), CO2-temperature sensitivity
    shock, damage-function parameter shock (climate-damage tipping points)
  10: Carbon-usage uncertainty (stochastic evolution of dirty energy's factor share).
  11: Temperature is influenced by the stock of carbon in the atmosphere, and the
    carbon cycle is modeled with two components of CO2 stock in the atmosphere.
  12: "Global mean surface temperature (TAt), climate tipping point (TPt), dirty energy\
    \ share in production (1-\u03B3), climate sensitivity parameter (\u03BB)"
  13: "Uncertainty in climate sensitivity parameter (\u03BB) modeled as a random walk\
    \ with upper and lower bounds; Uncertainty in the model\u2019s tipping-point parameter\
    \ (TP) modeled as a random walk until actual temperature reaches the tipping point,\
    \ after which the tipping point remains fixed, also with upper and lower bounds"
  15: Dirty energy usage causing a non-ergodic economy until it ceases; Potential
    for rare climate disasters.
  17: "Changes in \u03B3 (unspecified, but downward trend); CO2 emissions; Temperature\
    \ increase"
  18: Uncertainty in CO2 emissions and possibility of a persistent high share of dirty
    energy.
  19: Shocks to dirty energy usage.
  20: Delay in green energy implementation
  21: Shocks to the decline of dirty-energy usage, Consumption disasters
  22: Uncertainty about future dirty energy usage (emissions) and the degree to which
    CO2 translates into higher temperatures (climate-sensitivity coefficient).
  23: Stochastic climate sensitivity
  24: The key driver of risk is the increase in climate sensitivity parameter, which
    leads to temperature shocks and consequential damages to TFP (total factor productivity)
    and aggregate consumption.
  25: Uncertainties related to climate change
  26: Energy usage and temperature shocks; Climate uncertainty.
  27: "Three shocks are considered, including a stochastic tipping point (\u03F5TP,t)\
    \ with two possible values (-1/10 or +1/10) and reflecting barriers (TP = 2.5\
    \ and TP = 3.5) for the random walk of excess temperature."
  28: Transitory climate disasters impacting future generations; many disasters occur
    before/after year 200.
  29: Lower tipping points, large damages from climate change, three sources of uncertainty
    (not specified here).
  31: CO2 concentration in the atmosphere exceeding a threshold, leading to increased
    excess temperature.
  32: Uncertainty in climate change impacts
Highlights:
  2: Pareto-improving carbon taxation can dramatically lower climate risk, in general,
    and disaster risk, in particular.
  3: "Climate disasters can arise due to significant skewness in the distribution\
    \ of damages, which reflects the net impact of the model\u2019s non-linear elements;\
    \ Convexity in climate damage outweighs the concavity; Skewed supply-side damages\
    \ reinforce the skewed demand-side impact arising from risk aversion."
  4: The paper argues that policies based on models with altruistic agents may not
    be Pareto efficient in more realistic OLG models. With heterogeneous agents, optimal
    taxation requires Pareto improvements to be considered optimal.
  5: "Optimal carbon-risk taxation raises future generations\u2019 expected utilities\
    \ by up to 4 percent and lowers the probability of crossing a calamitous climate\
    \ tipping point from 9 to 1 percent, while keeping current generations at their\
    \ current utility level."
  6: The study focuses on limiting the chance of significant reductions in aggregate
    consumption using a carbon tax and generational redistribution of revenue.
  7: The model includes a tipping point at a 3-degree Celsius temperature increase,
    leading to significantly larger damages beyond that point.
  8: A carbon tax scheme can lead to substantial welfare gains for all generations,
    particularly those born in the future. Energy-usage shocks are a prerequisite
    for generating climate disasters. The climate-sensitivity parameter plays a crucial
    role in modern climate modeling.
  9: Climate-damage tipping points significantly increase the probability of climate
    disasters. Carbon taxes, particularly CO2-dependent taxes, can substantially reduce
    this probability.
  12: Climate change reduces output productivity, formulation of temperature damage
    function (Dt).
  13: The paper models uncertainty in climate sensitivity and tipping points using
    random walks with reflecting barriers; It explores the effects of different carbon
    tax policies, including time-invariant and carbon-dependent taxes.
  14: The model chooses carbon taxes and revenue transfers to guarantee a Pareto-improvement
    for all current and future generations while minimizing the probability of climate
    disasters. This is achieved by keeping current generations at their status-quo
    welfare levels and improving the welfare levels of all future generations.
  15: The economy is non-stationary until only clean energy is used. Rare events have
    the potential to considerably influence policy outcomes.
  17: In the absence of risk, there is essentially no scope/need for policy (optimal
    carbon tax is small).
  18: The model predicts substantial welfare losses for future generations, yet with
    policy constraints, improvement is possible with a welfare gain of 3.5% for generations
    born after 250 years.
  19: Major economic damages can arise if dirty energy is used for an extended period;
    a slow transition to clean energy can dramatically raise the probability of a
    climate disaster.
  20: Catastrophic damages, with a potential 30% GDP reduction, are possible after
    200 years if green energy adoption is delayed.
  21: A 25 percent tax on dirty energy generates welfare gains, particularly for future
    generations. This tax significantly reduces the probability of climate disasters
    and lowers temperatures, reducing damages.
  23: The climate model used in this paper is too simplistic to realistically model
    stochastic climate sensitivity.
  24: Climate sensitivity variations can cause substantial and prolonged decreases
    in aggregate consumption, emphasizing potentially severe long-term impacts on
    macroeconomic stability.
  25: The model does not predict climate catastrophes that push expected utility to
    negative infinity; aggregate consumption does not drop by more than two thirds
    in the model calibration.
  26: Climate uncertainty necessitates a lower optimal carbon tax rate compared to
    a scenario with no climate uncertainty because it causes an increase in precautionary
    savings that counteract the negative effects of the extra uncertainty.
  27: Without carbon taxation, the three-shock model results in significant damages
    with fairly high probability; the probability of climate disasters increases to
    about 9 percent compared to 5 percent in the model without a stochastic tipping
    point.
  28: In BAU scenarios, future generations will experience significant climate disasters.
  29: Climate change significantly decreases average future utilities. A fixed carbon
    tax can increase the welfare of future generations and decrease the probability
    of climate disasters, but cannot eliminate disaster risk completely. Uncertainty
    in the damage function plays a crucial role.
  30: Uncertainty regarding climate damages has significant quantitative effects.
    Carbon-dependent taxes can further reduce the risk of climate disasters. Imposing
    high carbon taxes once the CO2 concentration has reached a certain level might
    lead to consumption disasters.
  31: The probability of climate disaster is reduced to around 1.3 percent using the
    specified carbon tax, lower than with a fixed tax, but welfare gains for future
    generations are similar.
  32: The introduction of mean-preserving shocks can lead to significant and long-lasting
    damages; Carbon-risk taxes can achieve Pareto improvements and prevent climate
    disasters; Results provide lower bounds on possible damages and on improving carbon
    taxes.
Methodology:
  2: 12-period, overlapping generations model
  3: Overlapping generations (OLG) model with three distinct mean-zero, symmetric
    shocks; bare-bones model to isolate the cost of each form of risk propagation
  4: The paper critiques the use of altruistic, representative agent models for analyzing
    carbon policy, arguing that overlapping generations (OLG) models with selfish,
    life-cycle behavior are more realistic for capturing carbon externalities and
    climate risk.
  5: Large-scale OLG (Overlapping Generations) model with shocks to both the climate
    system and the macro-economy to identify optimal carbon-risk tax policies
  6: Stochastic Overlapping Generations (OLG) model; tax on dirty energy use (time-invariant
    or dependent on carbon in the atmosphere); time-varying sharing of tax revenues
    among generations to maintain expected utility; policy continues through period
    12 after which it stays constant.
  7: The paper adopts the carbon cycle and temperature equation from Golosov et al.
    (2014) and incorporates a tipping point to the standard Nordhaus damage function,
    following Weitzman (2012).
  8: Solving a model with and without uncertainty regarding dirty energy usage, climate
    sensitivity, and damage function parameters. The climate-sensitivity parameter
    is modeled as a random walk with reflecting barriers at -30% and +30% around the
    mean. Uses Weitzman (2012)'s damage function.
  9: Dynamic general equilibrium model with overlapping generations of agents and
    a representative firm
  10: Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with heterogeneous agents
    and incomplete financial markets. The model includes final goods production using
    capital, labor, and dirty energy, and dirty energy production using capital and
    labor. Carbon tax revenue is redistributed. Households maximize lifetime expected
    utility.
  11: The carbon cycle is modeled following Golosov et al. (2014) with the carbon
    stock being split into slowly and rapidly depreciating components.
  12: "Model uses a temperature damage function (Dt) to calculate productivity loss\
    \ (At), assuming constant non-stochastic production efficiency (Z). Dirty energy\
    \ share (\u03B3), climate sensitivity (\u03BB), and the tipping point (TP) follow\
    \ random walks."
  13: "The paper considers both time-invariant and carbon-dependent carbon-risk taxes;\
    \ For the time-invariant case, different tax rates are computed on a grid, with\
    \ transfers used to maintain the status quo for the old; A nonlinear tax is constructed\
    \ that performs better than the fixed tax; Carbon-risk taxation and the distribution\
    \ of carbon-risk revenues cease when \u03B3t reaches 1."
  14: Uses an overlapping generations (OLG) model with carbon taxation and revenue
    sharing. Employs a projection method developed in Marcet (1988), Marcet and Marshall
    (1994), Marcet and Lorenzoni (2001), and Judd et al. (2011), with implementation
    following Krusell and Smith (1998) and Kubler and Scheidegger (2019). Addresses
    non-ergodicity in early transition periods.
  15: Simulation-based method using Gaussian processes to approximate forecasts. Monte
    Carlo simulations are used to estimate probabilities of climate disasters, simulating
    the economy for 500 years (100 model-periods) repeated 5000 times. Period- and
    cohort-specific policy functions are solved for periods 1-300 conditional on dirty
    energy continuing to be used.
  17: OLG (Overlapping Generations) model with no uncertainty; Grid search and lump-sum
    inter-generational transfers to find optimal carbon tax
  18: Deterministic model with i.i.d shocks to dirty energy, assuming various probabilities
    for changes in these shares.
  19: Simulations are used to show the distribution of TFP-damages and temperatures
    under different periods with shocks to dirty energy usage, in the context of a
    Business as Usual equilibrium.
  20: Simulation of damages and temperatures over time.
  21: Optimal carbon policy calculation with shocks to dirty energy usage decline.
    Simulates 5000 paths.
  22: The analysis combines uncertainty about future dirty energy usage and climate
    sensitivity.
  23: "Models variation in climate sensitivity (\u03BBt) by assuming that it follows\
    \ a random walk. Uses shocks to \u03BB, which translates CO2 levels into the forcing\
    \ variable that raises the average global temperature."
  24: The analysis assumes a model using a random walk with reflecting barriers and
    evaluates equilibrium in an economy with no carbon taxes over time periods spanning
    up to 500 years.
  25: Model calibration; assessing catastrophic climate outcomes
  26: Numerical example, examining optimal carbon policy with energy usage and temperature
    shocks; Analysis focuses on utility and certainty equivalents for different generations
    under various carbon tax scenarios.
  27: A three-shock model is used, incorporating uncertainty in the damage function,
    where the tipping point evolves stochastically over time. The analysis considers
    periods 20 (100 years), 40 (200 years), and 100 (500 years).
  28: Analysis includes disaster periods lasting more than 100 years; results presented
    after 100 and 200 years.
  29: The analysis models climate risk and damages over 500 years. Optimal carbon
    policy is analyzed with three sources of uncertainty. A deterministic model is
    used for comparison.
  30: The analysis uses a model with a damage function relating temperature increases
    to economic damages, and experiments with different carbon tax schemes (fixed,
    and carbon dependent) to assess their impact on welfare. Results are applicable
    after 120 periods (years) for generations born after that time.
  31: Simulations are used to model carbon tax rates over 600 periods, based on a
    formula that increases taxes steeply once CO2 concentration reaches a given level.
  32: Model examining the role of uncertainty in optimal carbon taxation; Simplified
    model where agents do not know the tipping point and learn it when it happens.
More Notes:
  2: The model exhibits a de minimis climate problem absent its shocks.
  3: "Paper focuses on volatility in the economy\u2019s transition path, not the average\
    \ path of damages; the primary goal is finding Pareto-efficient paths of carbon-risk\
    \ taxes to limit downside carbon risk."
  5: Optimal carbon-risk tax policy is set to minimize the chance of reaching a climate
    tipping point subject to achieving a Pareto improvement, where current generations
    are kept whole. The level of carbon-risk taxation is substantial compared to the
    carbon average-damage process of correcting negative environmental externalities.
  6: The model supply side is similar to Cai et al. (2013) and Nordhaus (2017).
  7: The model implicitly treats clean energy as the economy's ability to produce
    with less reliance on dirty energy over time, rather than explicitly modeling
    clean energy.
  8: Agents' coefficient of relative risk aversion is assumed to be 2.
  9: The carbon-risk tax needed to handle carbon risk can be as large or larger than
    the carbon average-damage tax
  10: CO2 emissions are proportional to dirty energy use (E).
  12: Assumes secular growth is ignored for simplicity. Assumes that dirty energy
    usage ends 300 years later, although this can occur much earlier.
  14: The model uses generation-specific revenue shares that are adjusted in the first
    12 periods to ensure each initial cohort has the same expected remaining lifetime
    utility as without the policy. After 12 periods, revenue shares are held fixed.
  17: The benchmark case involves CO2 emissions decreasing monotonically and reaching
    zero after 120 years.
  20: Damages tend to recover after 500 years, but worst-case scenarios can still
    persist.
  21: The paper acknowledges that even the optimal carbon tax doesn't entirely prevent
    climate change and that higher taxes could further mitigate the problem, but at
    the cost of compensating current generations.
  22: Figures 5 and 6 show distributions of damages and temperature after 100 and
    200 years, respectively, suggesting a long-term modeling horizon.
  23: The paper aims to address the impact of a stochastic climate sensitivity.
  25: Figures 8 and 9 show the distribution of damages and temperature after 100 and
    200 years, respectively (although no information from these figures is given).
  26: The long-term economic damages (500-1000 years) don't directly translate into
    Pareto improvements today due to the need to compensate current generations.
  29: The paper compares the taxes in the model with three sources of uncertainty
    to optimal taxes in a deterministic model. The damages are assumed to be much
    more significant in the model with uncertainty.
  30: The paper suggests that in a world of certainty, even if damages are four times
    larger than typical calibrations, taxes and welfare gains are still relatively
    small.
  31: The carbon tax starts increasing if the excess temperature (at a climate sensitivity
    of 3) is 2 degrees. Carbon-risk taxes can increase to over 100 percent along some
    paths.

    by more than one third relative to trend) arising over the next 250 years is over
    7 percent, and 9 percent over the next 500 years, with no carbon policy.

    lower the probability of a climate disaster from 9 to 1 percent.
  6: A 15 percent decline in long-run output under business as usual (BAU).

    \ + (1/6.081 * TAt)^6.754)) where TAt is excess temperature."
  8: Initial generations gain about 0.1 percent in welfare; Generations born in 150
    years gain about 4 percent; Generations born in 200 years gain 5 percent; Welfare
    gains flatten to about 3 percent in the very long run.
  9: Climate-disaster probability increases to almost 9% in presence of all three
    types of uncertainty; fixed carbon-risk taxes can reduce the probability of climate
    disasters to around 3%; CO2-dependent taxes can reduce the likelihood below 1.5%
  12: "Dt= 1\u2212 1/(1+ (TAt/20.46)^2 + (TAt/TPt)^6.754), TPt= 6.081, At= (1 \u2212\

  18: Quantitative effects on GDP, with specified potential future damages and welfare
    losses.
  19: "\u03B3 = 0.88 as the reflecting lower boundary for the share of dirty energy\
    \ production; \u03B3 increases by 0.04 in every period on average; a worst-case\
    \ scenario where \u03B3 stays at 0.88 for 60 model periods (probability ~ 0);\
    \ distributions of TFP-damages and temperatures are shown for periods 20 (100\

  20: Worst-case scenario after 200 years corresponds to an almost 30 percent reduction
    in GDP.
  21: 'Optimal carbon tax rate: 25 percent. Generations born 200 years into the future
    gain 1.5 percent in consumption equivalence. Current generations gain 0.1 to 0.5
    percent. Climate disasters become very unlikely with a probability below 0.5 percent
    with the proposed carbon tax.'
  23: No relevant information
  24: The paper quantifies that in about 5 percent of cases, aggregate consumption
    decreases by more than one-third due to climate-related shocks.
  25: Aggregate consumption never drops by more than two thirds.
  26: Expected utility drops by around 5 percent; 'Optimal' fixed tax rate on dirty
    energy is 20 percent; Generations born 150 years from now or later gain about
    2 percent in certainty equivalence; Probability of a climate disaster is reduced
    from more than 5 percent to around 2.5 percent; Carbon tax is 5 percent lower
    than the one found for the case of no climate uncertainty.
  27: "The stochastic tipping point (\u03F5TP,t) can realize two values: -1/10 with\
    \ probability 1/2 and +1/10 with probability 1/2."
  29: Generations born in 200 years have a 7% lower expected utility (in consumption
    equivalents) than current generations; a fixed carbon tax of 35% increases the
    average welfare of generations born 200 years in the future by 4% (in consumption
    equivalents); the probability of climate disasters decreases to around 3.5% with
    a 35% tax.
  30: A fixed tax rate of roughly 20 percent leads to maximal welfare gains of about
    1.5 percent for generations born after 110 years.
  31: "Carbon tax rate (\u03C4t) is defined by the formula \u03C4t= 0 .3+ (110 * max(0,\
