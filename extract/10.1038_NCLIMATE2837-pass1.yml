Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (increasing aridity), rapid economic development, population growth,
    urbanization, increasing hydro-climatic intensity (shorter, less frequent, and
    less widespread precipitation events, increase in the length of dry spells).
  4: Changes in dryland subtypes, specifically increases in drier subtypes and decreases
    in wetter subtypes.
  5: Warming and drying trends exacerbate dryland expansion by causing higher vapor
    pressure deficit and evaporative demand, decreased soil moisture leading to increased
    sensible heat flux and decreased latent heat flux.
Highlights:
  1: Dryland expansion is underestimated in CMIP5 simulations. Bias-corrected projections
    show drylands covering half of the global land surface by the end of this century.
    Warming trends over drylands are double those over humid regions.
  4: Drylands are projected to increase in area, with a larger proportion of this
    increase occurring in developing countries; Drying areas are mainly distributed
    in eastern Siberia, northeastern China, western Asia, central Africa and Canada;
    the subtypes that become drier comprise a much larger area than the subtypes that
    become wetter
  5: "Drylands will expand by 23% and 11% relative to the observed baseline (1961\u2013\
    1990) by the end of the twenty-first century under RCP8.5 and RCP4.5, respectively,\
    \ covering 56% and 50% of the global land surface."
Methodology:
  1: Uses historical data to bias-correct CMIP5 projections from 20 global climate
    models. Aridity index (AI) is the ratio of total annual precipitation to potential
    evapotranspiration (PET). Examines historical simulations (1948-2005) and future
    projections (2006-2100) under RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios.
  4: CMIP5-EM model projections with RCP8.5 scenario, comparing future periods (2011-2040,
    2041-2070, 2071-2100) to a baseline (1961-1990).
  5: Analysis uses CRU observations and CMIP5-EM simulations to calculate regional
    average annual temperature trends from 1948-2005. GPP is related to the Aridity
    Index (AI) using data from 2000-2010.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the spatial and temporal evolution of drylands, aiming to
    inform decision-making for mitigating global desertification. Developing countries
    are identified as particularly vulnerable to the impacts of dryland expansion.
  5: Approximately 78% of the newly expanded dryland areas will be located in developing
    countries.

  2: This page focuses on climate modeling of aridity indices and land changes, and
    does not directly address macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, costs, or benefits
    of adaptation at a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Reduced carbon sequestration, enhanced regional warming, risk of land degradation
    and desertification, water scarcity.
  4: No relevant information
  5: Gross primary production (GPP) is affected, with GPP in arid regions approximately
    one-fifth of that in humid regions.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Dryland area projected to increase by 23% and 11% under RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 respectively,\
    \ relative to 1961\u20131990 baseline, equalling 56% and 50%, respectively, of\
    \ total land surface. Observed AI decreased with a mean net trend of -0.050 per\
    \ 58yr; CMIP5-EM trend is -0.012 per 58yr. 78% of dryland expansion and 50% of\
    \ the population growth will occur in developing countries under RCP8.5."
  4: Increase of drylands occurs more in developing countries (78%)
  5: "Average temperature increase is most significant in drylands, with a warm peak\
    \ of 1.17 \xB0C per 58 yr, approximately 2.1 and 1.5 times greater than the increase\
    \ in humid regions and the global mean, respectively."
