Drivers of Risk:
  1: The drivers of risk are climate change (increasing heat exposures), age structure,
    and socioeconomic factors.
  2: Changes in ambient temperature distributions and the frequency and intensity
    of heat extremes are identified as drivers of risk, impacting older adults' heat
    exposures.
  3: The primary drivers are increasing temperatures (hot days and TMAX95) due to
    climate change, coupled with demographic shifts, specifically population aging
    and growth. The analysis considers different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)
    interacting with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).
  4: 'Summer temperatures (CDDs, #HD, TMAX95), total population growth, demographic
    changes in age structure, heat exposure.'
  5: Climate change (increased temperatures) and population aging are identified as
    drivers of increased heat exposure.
  6: "The drivers of risk are historical climate, projected climate scenarios (SSP2(45)\
    \ and SSP5(85)), and population demographics. Specific climate factors include\
    \ CDDs (Cooling Degree Days), TMAX95 (maximum temperature above 95\xB0F),"
  7: Focuses on rising heat exposures and their interaction with aging populations.
  8: Climate change-driven enhancement of the urban heat island effect; heat extremes
  9: "Cooling degree days (CDD), 20-year average 95th percentile of daily maximum\
    \ temperatures (TMax95th), and 20-year average count of days with a dry bulb maximum\
    \ temperature of 37.5\xB0C (#HD)."
  10: The analysis considers different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) which
    implicitly incorporate climate and socioeconomic changes. It also analyzes population
    exposure to climate change driven increases in heat.

Evaluation overview:
  1: The paper evaluates the heat exposure of older adults globally.
  2: The study evaluates heat exposures of older individuals globally, focusing on
    chronic exposure to high average temperatures and acute exposure to extreme high
    temperatures.
  3: The study evaluates heat exposure, focusing on cumulative exposure measured by
    Cooling Degree Days (CDDs), frequency of hot days (#HDs), and intensity (TMAX95,
    the 95th percentile of daily maximum temperature).
  4: 'Age 69+ heat exposures: cumulative and regional frequency distributions. Focus
    on Cooling Degree Days (CDDs), Hot Days (#HD), and the 95th percentile of extreme
    heat exposure (TMAX95) impacts on older individuals.'
  5: The paper evaluates population exposure to heat, focusing on cumulative heat
    exposure (Person Degrees Days - PDDs).
  6: The paper evaluates heat exposure in older adults.
  7: Addresses exposure and adaptation to heat extremes, emphasizing direct morbidity
    and mortality impacts.
  8: Quantifies costs and effectiveness of interventions (increasing albedo, green
    spaces, early warning systems, public cooling) in terms of moderating morbidity
    and mortality risk related to heat.
  9: "Heat exposures are evaluated, considering cooling degree days (CDD), 20-year\
    \ average 95th percentile of daily maximum temperatures (TMax95th), and 20-year\
    \ average count of days with a dry bulb maximum temperature of 37.5\xB0C (#HD)."

Highlights:
  1: Heat exposure of older adults is increasing, particularly in Asia and Africa,
    with significant implications for public health.
  2: The paper identifies areas of extreme risk of elderly population heat exposures
    and quantifies chronic and acute heat exposures for different age groups globally.
  3: The global heat-exposed population aged 69+ is projected to grow considerably
    by 2050. The largest cumulative exposure changes are projected to occur in Africa
    and Asia. The increase in heat exposure is highly heterogeneous across regions
    and between age groups. The share of the population aged 69+ will increase in
    all continents, reaching the largest share in Europe. Asia will have the largest
    absolute numbers of individuals aged 69+ exposed to heat.
  4: Acute heat exposure is a great concern for older individuals. Europe shows some
    of the largest changes in heat exposure. Significant increase in the demand for
    indoor thermal regulation appliances.
  5: Older adults in Asia will experience nearly four times higher levels of heat
    exposure than other regions due to the large, aging population and hot climate.
    Climate change is the main driver in temperate regions of Europe and North America,
    while population aging is the defining driver in warmer regions. Africa is the
    region where total population growth will have the largest impact on absolute
    heat exposure.
  6: The projected acceleration of both chronic and acute heat exposures of older
    adults raises a serious concern for global public health. Climate change has a
    strong impact on the frequency of acute heat exposure, but a relatively negligible
    impact on the burden of the intensity of acute exposures.
  7: Identifies significant demands for social and health services due to unevenly
    distributed heat exposures among aging populations.
  8: Emphasizes the need to specifically address the distinctive needs of large and
    rapidly growing populations of older adults (69+) in adaptation solutions.
  9: Projected elderly population in the US in 2050 closely aligns with estimates
    from ref. 77.
  10: The table presents error metrics for population projections of the 69+ age group
    across different regions (US, EU, UK, China) under various SSP scenarios. The
    errors vary considerably across regions and scenarios.

Methodology:
  1: The study combines age-stratified demographic projections with downscaled temperature
    projections to mid-century.
  2: The methodology involves combining global gridded age-stratified demographic
    projections with temperature projections from CMIP6 downscaled, bias-corrected
    model output.
  3: The analysis uses climate projections from CMIP6 General Circulation Models (GCMs)
    under different SSP-RCP scenarios (SSP2(45), SSP1(26), SSP3(70), and SSP5(85))
    to project heat exposure for the population aged 69+ around the year 2050, comparing
    to a baseline period of 1995-2014. It combines these climate projections with
    future population projections. The exposure metrics are calculated globally and
    for macro-regions, considering both historical population/climate and future projections.
  4: CMIP6 GCMs (hot models excluded) used to project heat exposure for historical
    vs. 2050 under different SSP scenarios.
  5: The analysis considers SSP1(26), 2(45), 3(70), and 5(85) scenarios and examines
    GCM uncertainty ranges. It projects population exposure to different temperature
    levels (CDD, HDD, TMAX95) across age groups and regions from 2020 to 2050, examining
    the difference between SSP2(45) and current population, with subregional analysis
    at the country level presented in the SI appendix.
  6: The analysis uses climate scenarios SSP2(45) and SSP5(85) to project future heat
    exposure, applicable to the year 2050.
  8: Uses downscaled daily temperatures from the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily
    Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6) dataset from 14 GCMs for the 1995-2014
    historical period and future projections.  Projects age-stratified (69+ and <69)
    population counts on a 1-km grid for the year 2050 under different SSP scenarios,
    using WorldPop unconstrained gridded population estimates for the 2020 base year.
  9: "The study downscales gridded demographic projections to 2050 and compares them\
    \ with existing sub-national population projection studies. Population heat exposures\
    \ were calculated based on the gridded population projections, CDD (using a threshold\
    \ of 24\xB0C), TMax95th (20-year average), and #HD (days exceeding 37.5\xB0C,\
    \ 20-year average)."
  10: 'The analysis uses grid cells as the fundamental unit and decomposes the fractional
    change in regional-scale exposure into the sum of three terms: shifts in age structure,
    population size, and meteorology (climate change-driven increases in heat). Equations
    are provided for calculating population exposure based on age, population, and
    heat.'
  13: G.F. and I.S.W. conceived the experiments and designed the methodology; I.S.W.
    processed the climate data; G.F. conducted the experiments and generated the figures.
More Notes:
  1: The global population is aging at the same time as heat exposures are increasing.
  3: The study identifies a north-south divide in demographic composition in most
    continents, with the Americas and Oceania being less polarized. The maps reveal
    areas of growing overlapping stress in both heat exposure and an aging population.
    The study includes supplementary figures (SI-13, SI-16, SI-18, SI-19-SI-21) and
    tables (SI-2, SI-3) for additional information and comparisons.
  4: "Analysis decomposes the drivers of old-age individuals\u2019 heat exposure into\
    \ population growth, demographic changes, and heat exposure. The paper identifies\
    \ a critical threshold of 1200 CDDs/yr and 37.5\xB0C as dangerous, even under\
    \ short exposure. Europe's 69+ population will almost double by 2050."
  5: "Figures SI-19\u2013SI-21 present similar figures for SSP1(26), 3(70). and 5(85);\
    \ Figs. SI-23\u2013SI-37 presents decomposition results at the country level.\
    \ The study uses age stratification (<5, 5-14, 15-64, 65+)."
  6: Table SI-1 reports figures for scenarios SSP1(26) and 3(70). The intensity of
    acute exposures is mostly affected by shifts in the age structure of the population
    in areas where extreme temperatures are already high.
  8: Analysis accounts for country-level and regional SSP-consistent age-stratified
    population projections. The methodology involves a consistent imputation method
    for global projections due to the limited availability of harmonized, high-resolution,
    age-stratified population data.
  9: The limitation of the population projection approach is its assumption of geographically
    homogeneous, within-country trends by age stratum.
