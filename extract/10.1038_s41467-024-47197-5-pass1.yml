Drivers of Risk:
  1: Aging global population combined with increasing heat exposure due to climate
    change drive vulnerability in older adults.
  3: "frequency of acute heat exposure de\uFB01 ned by the number of hot days (#HDs)\
    \ with daily maximum temperature above 37.5\xB0 C, and the intensity of acute\
    \ heat exposure metric de\uFB01 ned as the 95th percentile (TMAX95) of the distribution\
    \ of daily maximum temperature for the combination of historical population and\
    \ climatology (1995\u20132014; \uFB01 rst column), and under the future evolution\
    \ of the population size and structure and climate of SSP 2(45) scenario (around\
    \ 2050; second column)."
  4: Total population growth, demographic changes in the age structure, and heat exposure.
  6: Increased heat exposure due to climate change and demographic shifts (aging population).
Highlights:
  1: Chronic heat exposure doubles across all warming scenarios, with Asia and Africa
    being most affected due to low adaptive capacity.
  3: "By the year 2050, the global heat-exposed population aged 69+ is projected to\
    \ grow considerably...Cumulative exposure changes are projected to occur in Africa,\
    \ Asia, South America and North America...future projected changes in cumulative\
    \ heat exposure are highly heterogeneous across regions, while also showing important\
    \ differences between age groups...more than 23% of the global population aged\
    \ 69+ is projected to be living in climates with TMAX95 > 37.5 C \xB0 in 2050\
    \ compared to 14% in 2020"
  4: Older individuals face growing acute heat exposure, especially in Europe, driving
    up demand for indoor thermal regulation with associated costs. Europe will host
    about one-fifth of the global population aged 69+ in 2050.
  6: The projected acceleration of both chronic and acute heat exposures of older
    adults is a serious concern for global public health. Climate change has a strong
    impact on the frequency of acute heat exposure.
Methodology:
  1: Combines age-stratified demographic projections with downscaled temperature projections
    to predict heat exposure to mid-century.
  3: "Exposure is also projected up to around mid-21st-century along three additional\
    \ climatic-demographic futures based on SSP-RCP interaction scenarios 1(26), 3(70),\
    \ and 5(85)...futures are de\uFB01 ned by the interplay between socio-demographic\
    \ and greenhouse gasses radiative forcing trends"
  4: Analysis based on CMIP6 global climate models (excluding hot models) comparing
    historical data to 2050 projections under SSP1(26), SSP2(45), SSP3(70), and SSP5(85)
    scenarios.
  6: The analysis projects the evolution of heat exposure determinants under different
    climate scenarios (SSP2(45) and 5(85)) and considers both climate change and demographic
    factors. The results are applicable to the years considered in the table (Historical,
    2050).
More Notes:
  3: "In this scenario framework, futures are de\uFB01 ned by the interplay between\
    \ socio-demographic and greenhouse gasses radiative forcing trends"
  4: "Critical thresholds of 1200 CDDs/yr and 37.5\xB0C are identified as dangerous\
    \ temperatures even under short exposure."
  6: The paper also references results for SSP1(26) and SSP3(70) in Table SI-1 (not
    shown on this page). The impact of climate change on the intensity of acute exposures
    is considered relatively negligible, with shifts in the age structure of the population
    in areas with already high extreme temperatures being the more important factor.

    \ with dangerous heat levels, compared to 14% today, affecting an additional 177\u2013\
    246 million older adults."
