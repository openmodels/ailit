Drivers of Risk:
  1: Higher summer temperatures (specifically in January); Precipitation changes (though
    no effect found on GDP).
  2: Temperature and rain precipitation fluctuations, specifically temperature increases
    during the summer months (January).
  3: Climate change
  4: Not explicitly stated on this page, but implied to be climate change impacts
    affecting various industries.
  5: Temperature and precipitation changes
  8: Decrease in precipitation and increase in temperatures for all macrozones of
    Chile except the North between 1980-1989 and 2010-2017.
  10: Temperature and precipitation, measured as quarterly averages.
  11: Monthly average temperatures.
  12: Global temperature change under different RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5).
  13: "Global temperature increase (0.26\xB0C, 1.0\xB0C, 1.3\xB0C, 1.4\xB0C, 2.0\xB0\
    C for 2050, and 1.0\xB0C, 1.8\xB0C, 2.2\xB0C, 3.7\xB0C for 2100) after 1985 and\
    \ 2017, respectively."
  14: "Temperature increase (0.26\xB0C, 1.0\xB0C, 1.3\xB0C, 1.4\xB0C, 1.8\xB0C, 2.0\xB0\
    C, 2.2\xB0C, 3.7\xB0C) and climate change impacting various industries."
  15: Temperature increase induced by climate change
  16: Temperature increase as a result of climate change impacts economic output.
  17: Higher temperatures, particularly in January, negatively impact specific economic
    sectors like Agriculture-Silviculture and Fishing.
  18: Climate change, specifically changes in seasonal temperatures and precipitation
    fluctuations.
  19: Climate change, precipitation and temperature fluctuations.
Highlights:
  1: No effect of precipitation changes on GDP; Negative impact of higher summer temperatures
    on Agriculture-Silviculture and Fishing; Climate change did not have a big impact
    on the Chilean economy during the period 1985-2017.
  2: Climate change has had a statistically significant impact on the Agriculture
    and Fishing sectors in Chile during the Summer season, with each degree Celsius
    increase in January resulting in a 3% and 12% GDP reduction, respectively. However,
    many industries have either been unaffected or could even benefit from temperature
    increases.
  3: Region XIII (Metropolitan Region of Santiago) represents around 40% of the national
    GDP and population.
  4: Mining, Financial Services, Manufacturing, Personal Services and Commerce are
    the largest economic sectors in Chile. Mining represents over 50% of GDP in regions
    II and III.
  5: Financial Services and Commerce are more prevalent in the capital region, while
    Mining has almost no value for the capital, even if it represents the largest
    economic sector in the nation. Mean precipitation has been falling in Chile over
    time, while mean temperatures have increased substantially.
  8: An overall decrease in precipitation and increase in temperatures for Chile documented
    between 1980-1989 and 2010-2017, with distinct regional variations.
  10: Temperature has a statistically significant negative impact on the Agriculture-Silviculture
    and Fishing sectors.
  11: The impact of temperature varies across months and industries. Some coefficients
    are statistically significant (indicated by , , or ).
  12: Fishing and Mining are negatively impacted by climate change with statistical
    significance using the quarterly weather model. Using the monthly fluctuations
    model, Agriculture, Fishing, Manufacture, EGA, Construction, and Commerce see
    reduced growth rates of -3%, -12.1%, -2.2%, -3.9%, -0.3% and -0.7% respectively,
    for a 1 degree Celsius temperature increase.
  13: "Fishing and Mining sectors' GDP are negatively impacted by climate change.\
    \ With all model's estimated coefficients, Fishing's GDP almost disappears by\
    \ 2100, even with a 1.0\xB0C increase in temperature. Mining and Home property\
    \ would also decrease by at least 55% and 25.5%, respectively, by 2100. However,\
    \ the total Chilean GDP is projected to increase across all scenarios in 2050\
    \ and 2100 with all model's coefficients."
  14: Agriculture, Fishing, Manufacture, EGA, Construction, and Commerce are the industries
    most negatively impacted by climate change. The negative impact of climate change
    on total GDP could range between 9% and 14.8% in 2050 and between 16.8% and 29.6%
    in 2100 (Table 9).
  15: The impact of climate change on Chilean GDP varies significantly depending on
    the model coefficients used, ranging from large positive impacts to moderately
    negative impacts. Some industries are projected to be more negatively impacted
    than others. Applying US coefficients suggests negative impacts on Construction,
    Home property, Financial Services, and Manufactures.
  16: By 2050, total GDP deterioration between 6.8% and 12.9%; by 2100, GDP deterioration
    could be between 15.5% and 42.3% due to climate change.
  17: Climate change has limited effect on Chile's GDP, with major impacts in a few
    months and on certain sectors; overall positive projected impact on GDP by 2100
    when all model coefficients are considered.
  18: Climate change may have a negative impact on Chilean GDP in the future, with
    estimates varying depending on the scenario and the treatment of positive coefficients.
    There is no clear evidence of a significant impact of climate change on Chilean
    economic activity in the past.
Methodology:
  1: Region-industry panel data for Chile over the period 1985 to 2017; Stresstestexercises
    that select only the negative and statistically significant coefficients.
  2: Econometric model using annual frequency GDP data for 12 economic sectors across
    15 regions of Chile over the period 1985 to 2017. The model includes temperature
    and precipitation for each season, industry-region growth lag, time fixed-effects,
    and fixed-effects for the regions.
  3: Uses a panel dataset of 15 regions and 12 industries, adjusting for regional
    splits in 2007. Data harmonization is performed to join separate GDP series with
    different base years (1986, 1996, 2003, and 2013) using adjustment factors based
    on common years. Includes analysis using a set of 13 regions over the entire period
    1985-2017.
  4: Uses adjusted GDP series from 1985-2017, linking earlier datasets using adjustment
    factors. Adjusts nominal GDP using the UF (Unidad de Fomento, a real monetary
    unit indexed to CPI) to obtain real GDP.
  5: The study uses weather data from the University of Delaware Air Temperature and
    Precipitation dataset (1900-2017), with a grid size of 0.5 degree latitude x 0.5
    degree longitude. Geospatial software (QGIS) is used to aggregate the weather
    data to the regional level. Regional weather series are created as a weighted
    average of the weather series of each grid, where the weight is equal to the share
    of the grid that intersects the region. National-wide temperature and precipitation
    are reported as weighted averages of the regions by surface area or by GDP.
  8: "Results for Chile and each macrozone weighted by region\u2019s surface area\
    \ and regional GDP in 2017."
  10: OLS regressions with fixed effects by time and region, run separately for each
    industry, using quarterly data. Results are applicable for Chile.
  11: OLS regressions with fixed effects by time and region, separate regressions
    by industry. The model uses monthly weather fluctuations. Robust standard errors
    clustered by year and region.
  12: 'The analysis considers the impact of a given global temperature change on GDP
    growth rate and GDP level of each industry. It uses the average path values of
    United Nations modeling experts. Three estimates are produced: using all estimated
    coefficients, only statistically significant coefficients, and only statistically
    significant and negative coefficients.'
  13: The analysis simulates the impact of different temperature increases on various
    industries and overall GDP in Chile, using estimated coefficients from a model.
    The simulations are run for different climate emission paths. Results are applicable
    to 2017, 2050, and 2100. Different simulations are performed applying all model
    coefficients, only statistically significant coefficients, and only negative coefficients.
  14: The analysis uses statistically significant coefficients from a monthly model
    (Table 5 of the source paper). The applicability of the results is limited to
    the conditions and assumptions of that model and the specified time horizons (2017,
    2050, and 2100).
  15: Uses a model with coefficients estimated for Chile, and a counterfactual exercise
    applying temperature impact coefficients from a model estimated for the USA by
    Colacito, Hoffmann and Phan (2019) to Chilean industries. Uses IPCC (2021) temperature
    projection paths.
  16: Simulated impact based on temperature coefficients estimated for the USA, adapted
    to Chile's industries; results applicable for future scenarios in 2050 and 2100.
  17: Analysis based on region-industry panel data from 1985 to 2017; projections
    consider the global climate paths published by the United Nations.
  18: Panel data analysis of industry-region GDP with temperature and precipitation
    fluctuations. Results are annual frequency based on a model with fixed coefficients
    instead of time-varying parameters.
  19: "Uses counterfactual exercises using the most recent \u201CShared Socioeconomic\
    \ Pathways\u201D (SSPs) scenarios published by the IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment\
    \ Report (IPCC 2021)."
More Notes:
  1: The paper aims to provide evidence on the impact of rising temperatures on economic
    activities beyond sectors naturally exposed to outdoor weather conditions.
  3: The paper uses National Accounts data publicly available from the Central Bank
    of Chile [26].
  4: Negative industry-region GDP values are replaced with 0 when calculating growth
    rates. Financial services costs are over-estimated before 2008. There are large
    disparities in average GDP for each industry across the 15 regions.
  10: The analysis uses reduced-form coefficients, so specific channels driving the
    results are not verified. Results are qualitatively similar when using constant
    weights for each industry and different clustering options.
  11: 'The regressions include lagged industry growth rate and monthly precipitation.
    The table presents results for 12 industries: Agriculture, Fishing, Mining, Manufacturing,
    EGA (Electricity, Gas, and Water), Construction, Commerce, Transport, Financial
    Services, Home, Personal Services, Public Administration.'
  12: The impact costs are measured relative to a world with no climate change, not
    relative to 2017.
  13: The positive impacts on other sectors that drive the increase in overall GDP
    may not materialize as the coefficients used in the model are fixed over time.
    The analysis also considers scenarios where only statistically significant, and
    only negative coefficients are applied.
  14: Table 8 shows results considering all statistically significant coefficients,
    while Table 9 only considers those with negative values. The table specifies which
    industries correspond to which column numbers (1-12).
  15: The small number of regions in Chile with low economic value in some industries
    makes it harder to reliably estimate the economic impact of climate change. The
    study uses US coefficients as a robustness check, acknowledging differences in
    industry composition between the US and Chile.
  18: The study acknowledges limitations due to the annual frequency of the data and
    the use of fixed coefficients. It suggests more research is required to know whether
    the effects of climate change are permanent over the long term. The study also
    mentions that industries and governments may undertake investments and implement
    regulations to adjust for long-run climate.

    precipitation/temperature trends, and GDP by region.
