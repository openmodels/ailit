Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change leading to changes in temperature and precipitation impacting
    biophysical crop yields (YEXO).
  3: Initial productivity shock (YEXO) due to climate change impacts is the primary
    driver of risk considered.
  5: Macroeconomic effects from climate change are transferred significantly to production-side
    and trade responses.
  6: "Climate change impacts on crop yields, represented by climate data for 2000\
    \ and 2050 based on the most extreme RCP (radiative forcing \u223C8.5 W/m2 by\
    \ 2100) with limited CO2 fertilization effects. Productivity effects are at the\
    \ upper end of direct yield effects."
Highlights:
  2: Economic models show that climate change reducing yields leads to reduced consumption,
    increased prices, and shifts in production and trade. There are large differences
    in the relative contribution of response options among the economic models. Economic
    adjustment occurs through changes in price.
  3: Economic models contribute substantially to the variability in AREA, PROD, TRSH,
    and CONS; consumption responds little due to price sensitivity; Trade and area
    responses are strongly affected by varying assumptions about trade flexibility
    and land conversion; Some models show significant management response to regional
    shocks (ENVISAGE, FARM, GTEM), while others are relatively unresponsive (AIM,
    GCAM, IMPACT, MAGNET).
  5: All models demonstrate significant effects of climate change on the production
    side and trade responses, underlining that biophysical-only impact assessments
    can underestimate response capacity.
  6: The study assesses agricultural risks of climate change in the 21st century,
    focusing on crop yield effects. It uses a combination of climate models, crop
    models, and economic models to estimate the impact of climate change on agricultural
    production and trade.
Methodology:
  2: The paper uses a combination of general circulation models (GCMs), global gridded
    crop models (GGCMs), and global economic models (both computable general equilibrium
    (CGE) and partial equilibrium models) to simulate the impacts of climate change
    on agriculture and the economy. Seven scenarios based on combinations of crop
    models and GCMs using RCP 8.5 are compared across nine economic models. Climate
    change effects on agricultural productivity are added to a reference scenario.
  3: The analysis uses a regression framework to assess the relationship between an
    initial productivity shock (YEXO) and various response variables (PROD, TRSH,
    YTOT, YENDO, AREA). Analysis of variance is used to investigate individual contributions
    to variation of different source
  5: The analysis involves a systematic comparison of the responses of the global
    food system to climate change using various global economic models.
  6: Crop models are used with climate data as inputs to generate yields. Economic
    models use exogenous productivity shocks as yield determinants (YEXO). Computable
    general equilibrium (CGE) models use shifts in land efficiency parameters, while
    partial equilibrium models use additive shifters in yield or supply equations.
    Crop model data is transformed to inputs for economic modeling, addressing challenges
    like deriving yield effects for crops not included in the crop models, aggregating
    from high-resolution spatial crop model outputs to lower resolution country or
    regional units, and determining yield effects over time.
More Notes:
  2: The standardization of model outputs allows the authors to compare the effects
    of climate change on yields, area, production, consumption, and prices across
    different models. Responses are common across all models, but the magnitude of
    responses varies significantly across models, crops, and regions.
  3: Model-specific differences in regional impacts are notable. Reallocation effects,
    particularly through international trade (GLOBIOM), can exacerbate climate change
    effects.
  5: The analysis emphasizes the importance of differing model structures and parameterization
    in determining the outcomes of climate shock responses.
  6: The analysis does not include the deleterious effects of increased ozone concentrations,
    biotic stresses from pests and diseases, and the likelihood of increased extreme
    events. Baseline in economic models uses GDP and population values from Shared
    Socioeconomic Pathway 2 (SSP2).
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Changes in consumption (CONS) as a result of climate change impacts on agriculture.
  3: Consumption (CONS) is analyzed, representing a macroeconomic outcome; Production
    (PROD) and yields (YTOT, YENDO) are examined as productivity measures; Trade share
    (TRSH) is also considered.
  6: Percentage change in variables YEXO (exogenous yield), YTOT (total yield), AREA
    (area), CONS (consumption), and PRICE (price) for wheat, coarse grain, rice, and
    oil seeds, relative to a reference scenario due to climate change. Trade share
    (TRSH), defined as the difference in net imports between climate change and reference
    scenarios divided by reference scenario production.
Quantitative material:
  2: Mean decline in biophysical yield (YEXO) of 17%; final yield decline (YTOT) of
    11%; mean area increase of 11%; mean decline in production of 2%; mean decline
    in consumption of 3%; average producer price increase of 20%; increase in the
    share of global trade in world production by 1%.
  3: 'SD values for variables: YEXO (13%), YTOT (17%), AREA (25-26%), PROD (25-26%),
    TRSH (25-26%), CONS (6%). Regression analysis provides slope coefficients (elasticities)
    for response variables to the initial shock YEXO.'
  6: "CO2 concentration in 2050 is 540 ppm under the RCP scenario. Yields are generated\
    \ at 0.5\xB0 resolution (about 55.5 km at the equator). Global population reaches\
    \ 9.3 billion by 2050, an increase of 35% relative to 2010, and global GDP triples,\
    \ based on SSP2. Resulting yield changes between 2005 and 2050 for selected crops\
    \ in selected countries are reported in Table S10."
