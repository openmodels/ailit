Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change, land-use change, intensive transportation of humans and goods,
    burgeoning urbanization, the urban heat island effect, and trade/transport of
    goods and materials.
  3: Ongoing climate change, increasing travel and trade, land-use changes, and socioeconomic
    factors facilitating the transport and spread of alien species.
  6: Human population movements, human trade, planes, ship/sea transport, wind (anemochory),
    and animal hosts (birds, cattle, dogs, horses, pigs, rats/rodents, reptiles) are
    identified as drivers of introduction of hematophagous arthropods.
  7: Connectivity among cities, international trade and anthropogenic environmental
    disturbances are likely to increase in the future, providing novel opportunities
    for the expansion or new introduction of hematophagous arthropods.
  8: Climate warming increases favorable thermal niches for hematophagous arthropod
    development, including at higher latitudes and altitudes.
  9: Future climate change could lead to the proliferation of invasive hematophagous
    arthropods, currently not impactful.
  10: Climate change is identified as a driver that exacerbates the geographic expansion
    of hematophagous arthropods, potentially increasing the risk of disease spread.
  11: Climate change is likely to increase the area occupied by current arthropod
    invaders by 18% over the next 3 decades.
  12: Agricultural practices, including the use of NPK fertilizers which enhance food
    biomass for mosquito larvae in rice and vegetable crops, and the use of insecticides,
    herbicides, and fungicides leading to insecticide resistance.
  13: Climate change is predicted to further increase the worldwide invasion of hematophagous
    arthropods.
  14: Accelerated worldwide urbanization and interconnectivity could further support
    mosquito proliferation and adaptations to human-modified environments.
Evaluation overview:
  2: Impacts on ecosystems and human health due to invasive hematophagous arthropods
    and associated diseases.
  3: Ecological, economic, and social impacts of invasive hematophagous arthropods
    and the pathogens they vector.
  6: Mentions historical outbreaks of yellow fever, suggesting a focus on disease
    incidence as an outcome.
  8: Mentions climate change worsening health risks by increasing zoonotic diseases,
    transmission, and disease vector population growth after the arrival of alien
    hematophagous arthropods.
  10: The paper evaluates the economic costs of hematophagous arthropods and their
    impact on human societies, focusing on the economic burden and disability-adjusted
    life years (DALY) lost.
  11: Invasions by hematophagous arthropods can cause substantial impacts through
    nuisance biting affecting recreational and real estate values.
  12: Mosquito proliferation and the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.
Highlights:
  2: Invasive hematophagous arthropods pose a growing threat to humans due to their
    ability to vector infectious and potentially lethal pathogens and parasites. Stronger
    preventative monitoring and transboundary surveillance measures are urgently required
    to mitigate future invasions and novel disease outbreaks.
  3: Changing climate and increasing travel and trade are interactive forces driving
    establishment success during introduction of invasive hematophagous arthropods.
  6: Ae. aegypti and the Cx. pipiens complex are associated with historical events
    related to international trade and colonialism.
  8: Climate change is likely to worsen health risks by increasing zoonotic diseases,
    transmission and disease vector population growth.
  9: Tick species such as Ixodes may expand their range in response to climate change,
    potentially affecting disease transmission.
  10: There is a significant economic burden associated with the spread of hematophagous
    arthropods, and climate change is expected to increase mosquito populations and
    disease outbreaks.
  11: The presence of urban water storage containers can greatly improve connectivity
    among Ae. aegypti populations.
  12: Intensive agriculture and pesticide use leads to resistance and decline of mosquito
    predators.
  14: Social-ethnological approaches represent a valuable perspective for setting
    mitigation measures in the context of proliferations of hematophagous arthropods.
Methodology:
  3: Review examines the different actions and roles that invasive hematophagous arthropods
    play in a rapidly changing world, considering a range of socioeconomic and ecological
    contexts and case studies.
  6: The analysis involves a review of the invasion history of mosquito species like
    Ae. aegypti and members of the Cx. pipiens complex.
  9: Assessment of population dynamics and distributions of hematophagous arthropods
    to predict effects of climate change on disease transmission.
More Notes:
  6: The page uses a graphic to illustrate modes of introduction and extinction (pesticide
    use) of various hematophagous arthropods.
  13: This paper is a review, so the information presented is a synthesis of existing
    literature rather than a novel analysis.
  14: Highlights the importance of placing the management of hematophagous arthropods
    in a wider biodiversity context.
Quantitative material:
  3: Economic cost of invasive alien species reached at least US$ 2.168 trillion over
    the last 4 decades; invasive aquatic and semi-aquatic invaders have a total cost
    of potentially US$ 311 billion.
  8: For Ae. aegypti, an increasing global suitability for life cycle completion of
    +1.5% per decade between 1950 and 2000, predicted to accelerate to +3.2% per decade,
    and even up to +4.4% per decade, by 2050.
  11: Current management delays of 55 years for the Aedes genus have led to an additional
    cost of US$ 4.57 billion.
  12: Survival rates of Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae in waters contaminated by fertilizers
    are two-to-three times as great as in uncontaminated waters.
