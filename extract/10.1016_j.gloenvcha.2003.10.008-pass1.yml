Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change scenarios (HadCM3 model under SRES A1FI, A2, B1, and B2), socio-economic
    scenarios (population dynamics, economic and political structures), levels of
    atmospheric CO2.
  4: Population levels for each SRES scenario drive estimated future demand for cereals.
  7: Climate change impacts on agriculture (changes in temperature and precipitation),
    modeled through the HadCM3 SRES A2b and A2c scenarios.
  8: Climate change impacts modeled using HadCM3 SRES B1a and B2a scenarios, with
    and without CO2 effects.
  10: Different SRES emissions scenarios (A1, A2, B1, B2); Climate Change; Elevated
    atmospheric CO2 concentrations
  12: Climate change impacts, including temperature increases and precipitation decreases,
    as well as CO2 fertilization effects on crop yields, population growth, and economic
    development levels are the drivers of risk.
  13: Anthropogenic climate change, CO2 effects (fertilization), changes in temperature,
    income levels, population growth.
  14: Climate change impacts on crop yields, including direct effects of CO2 and farm-level
    adaptations; SRES emissions scenarios; Interactions with nutrients, water, weeds,
    pests, and other stresses.
Highlights:
  1: The world can mostly feed itself under SRES scenarios, but this relies on developed
    countries compensating for declines in developing nations. Regional differences
    in crop production will likely grow, leading to increased prices and hunger in
    poorer nations, especially under scenarios of greater inequality (A1FI and A2).
  7: Without adaptation, the model projects significant decreases in national cereal
    yields, particularly in Africa, South Asia, and Central America, by the 2050s
    and 2080s. Adaptation measures can mitigate these negative impacts, leading to
    more favorable yield changes, but negative impacts still increase over time.
  8: The maps illustrate a trend of increasing challenges in crop production, with
    many regions projected to experience decreases in cereal yield over time, especially
    by the 2080s.
  10: Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations help to mitigate the negative impact
    of climate change on crop yields.
  12: Without considering CO2 fertilization, substantial reductions in cereal production
    are estimated by the 2080s (5% for B1/B2, 10% for A1/A2). CO2 fertilization reduces
    these losses. Inequality of income in the A2 world results in the number of people
    at risk of hunger remaining largely unaltered at around 800 million.
  13: Without CO2 fertilization effects, crop production responds approximately linearly
    to temperature increases across the suite of scenarios. The number of people at
    risk of hunger is very high under the A2 scenario, approaching double the reference
    case by the 2080s without CO2 effects, partly because of higher temperatures and
    reduced yields, but primarily because there are many more poor people in the A2
    world.
  14: The world, for the most part, appears to be able to continue to feed itself
    under the SRES scenarios during the rest of this century. Production in the developed
    countries generally benefits from climate change, compensating for declines projected
    for developing nations. Regional differences in crop production are likely to
    grow stronger through time, leading to a significant polarisation of effects,
    with substantial increases in risk of hunger amongst the poorer nations.
Methodology:
  1: Crop yield changes are calculated using transfer functions from crop model simulations.
    A basic linked system (BLS) evaluates changes in global cereal production, cereal
    prices, and people at risk from hunger. SRES scenarios are used.
  4: The BLS was first run for a reference case (i.e., assuming no climate change)
    for each SRES pathway.
  7: The analysis uses the HadCM3 climate model and the SRES A2b and A2c scenarios
    to project future cereal yield changes at a national level. The analysis compares
    scenarios with and without CO2 fertilization effects.
  8: Climate change scenarios (HadCM3 SRES B1a and B2a) are used to model potential
    impacts on national cereal yields over time.
  10: BLS simulations, using nationally averaged yield changes for wheat, rice, maize,
    and soybean estimates. The results do not diverge until mid-century. Small changes
    in cereal yield are evident in all scenarios by the 2020s.
  12: The analysis uses the BLS to estimate future cereal production, prices, and
    hunger risk under different SRES climate scenarios (A1, A2, B1, B2) to 2080s with
    and without CO2 fertilization effects considered. Scenarios include differing
    population growth and economic development projections.
  13: The measure of risk of hunger is based on the number of people whose incomes
    allow them to purchase sufficient quantities of cereals. The analysis considers
    the impact of climate change on crop yields and current trends in economic and
    population growth rates, specifically looking at world cereal production in the
    2080s under different SRES scenarios.
  14: Crop yield changes were introduced to the BLS world food trade system model.
More Notes:
  1: The contrast between developed and developing countries yield changes is largest
    under the A2a-c scenarios. B2 future crop yield changes are slightly more favourable
    than those of the B1 scenario.
  7: The study doesn't explicitly quantify macroeconomic or fiscal impacts (GDP, budgets,
    etc.), but provides essential input data (cereal yield changes) for such analyses.
    The study also highlights the importance of including adaptation strategies in
    climate change impact assessments.
  8: The analysis considers both scenarios with and without CO2 fertilization effects
    on crop yields.
  10: Regional variations within countries are not reflected in the analysis.
  14: The realization of potential beneficial effects of CO2 in the field remain uncertain.
    There is significant variation due to natural variability.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Risk of hunger, cereal prices, global cereal production.

    driver of agricultural productivity and economic activity, especially in agrarian
    economies. It also implicitly addresses food security and its effect on national
    economies.

Quantitative material:
  1: Yield decreases are greatest under A1FI by the 2080s.
  7: The paper presents quantitative projections of national cereal yield changes
    (%), comparing scenarios with and without CO2 effects, for the 2020s, 2050s, and
    2080s, relative to 1990.
  8: Projected percentage changes in national cereal yields for the 2020s, 2050s,
    and 2080s compared with 1990, illustrated through world maps with color gradations
    indicating yield increases or decreases.
  10: Figure 10 shows future reference case global cereal prices, relative to 1990
    prices, for the four SRES marker scenarios (no climate change). Figure 11 shows
    future reference case estimates of the numbers of people at risk of hunger, for
    the four SRES marker scenarios (no climate change).
  12: Estimates of cereal production changes (in million metric tonnes) are provided
    under different SRES scenarios. Cereal prices are expected to rise in the A2 world
    by >160% and between 30% and 70% in A1 and B1 by the 2050s.
  13: Changes in global cereal production (millions of tons) are shown for 2020, 2050,
    and 2080 under seven SRES scenarios (A1FI, A2a, A2b, A2c, B1a, B2a, B2b) with
    and without CO2 effects, relative to a reference scenario (no climate change).
    Changes in global cereal prices (% change from 1990) are shown similarly. The
    number of additional millions at risk of hunger is shown in Fig. 14.
  14: Figure 14 shows additional millions of people at risk under seven SRES scenarios
    with and without CO2 effects, relative to the reference scenario (no climate change).
    Global crop yields may decrease by /C09% to /C022% under A1 and A2 scenarios or
    /C016% to /C022%.
