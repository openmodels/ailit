Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increasing risk of forest fires as a consequence of climate change.
  2: Increasing risk of forest fires due to climate change, specifically increased
    temperature and decreased precipitation.
  3: Changes in climate became evident as early as the end of the nineteenth century;
    annual precipitation has been falling while the annual temperature has been increasing;
    heat waves have become more frequent; weather conditions and fuel loading are
    the main causes of forest fires; forest fire severity has increased.

  5: Burned areas, temperature, and precipitation.
  6: Burned areas and weather conditions (temperature and precipitation) affecting
    tourism.
  7: Share of burned areas, temperature, amount of rainfall.
  8: Burned areas, temperature increases, and reduction in rainfall.
  9: Temperature (third quartile); Precipitation (third quartile); Future projections
    are interpreted with respect to the average temperature and precipitation of the
    period studied.
  10: Increase in burned areas in 2030 and 2050, driven by climate change (specifically,
    average temperature and precipitation changes under the A1B scenario).
  11: Increased burned area projections due to climate change
  13: Burned areas (wildfires) are impacting the number of domestic and inbound tourist
    arrivals in Portugal.
  16: Increase in burned areas due to fires.
Highlights:
  1: Forest fires have a considerable negative impact on the number of tourist arrivals
    in Portugal, with significant estimated costs to the Portuguese economy in 2030
    and 2050.
  2: Burned areas have a considerable negative impact on the number of tourist arrivals
    in Portugal; estimated annual costs to the Portuguese economy due to increased
    burned areas in the year 2030 range between e17.03 and 24.18 million for domestic
    tourist arrivals and between e18.26 and 38.08 million for inbound tourist arrivals;
    costs will increase by a factor of at least four in 2050.
  4: No relevant information
  6: Control for regional specific trends and fixed effects to assess the impact of
    burned areas on tourist arrivals.
  7: Burned areas have a considerable and persistent negative impact on tourist arrivals,
    with the current impact being less than half of the total cumulative impact.
  8: Burned areas negatively impact tourism. Current burned areas affect the future
    number of visitors. Temperature and precipitation significantly influence the
    share of burned areas.
  9: Increased temperature is associated with a statistically significant increase
    in burned areas, while increased precipitation is associated with a statistically
    significant decrease in burned areas; Many municipalities are projected to experience
    increases in burned areas by 2030 and 2050, particularly inland municipalities
    near Spain.
  10: Projected increases in burned areas are expected to reduce domestic tourist
    arrivals across many municipalities in Portugal by 2030 and 2050. Some municipalities
    may initially benefit in 2030, but fewer will continue to do so by 2050.
  11: Burned area projections are expected to negatively impact tourist arrivals,
    with the situation worsening from 2030 to 2050. The Porto and Lisbon metropolitan
    areas are particularly vulnerable. Inbound tourism is also expected to decrease,
    especially in areas near Spain. Hotel revenue losses are projected in 'realistic'
    scenarios.
  13: Negative relationship between burned areas and tourist arrivals; persistence
    of impact over several years.
  16: Burned areas have a statistically significant negative impact on tourist arrivals,
    both domestic and inbound.
Methodology:
  1: "Uses data for 278 municipalities for the 2000\u20132016 period to estimate the\
    \ impact of burned areas on the number of tourist arrivals, both domestic and\
    \ inbound. Provides predictions for 2030 and 2050."
  2: Using data from 2000 to 2016 on 278 municipalities in Portugal to estimate the
    impact of burned areas on the number of inbound and domestic tourists; providing
    predictions for 2030 and 2050.
  4: No relevant information
  5: "Heckman\u2019s sample selection model is applied to address the issue of missing\
    \ tourist arrival data for municipalities with fewer than three hotels. A probit\
    \ model with fixed effects is used as the selection equation. The main equation\
    \ models tourist arrivals as a function of burned area, temperature, and precipitation."
  6: Panel linear regression model with fixed effects, focusing on factors like burned
    areas and weather conditions impacting tourist arrivals.
  7: Panel data analysis using data from 278 municipalities in Portugal from 2000
    to 2016, employing a Heckman procedure to address non-random missing values. Future
    projections of burned areas in 2030 and 2050 are presented.
  8: The analysis uses regression models with fixed effects to estimate the impact
    of burned areas, population density, crime, and other factors on tourist arrivals.
    Future temperature and precipitation are projected based on the A1B scenario (rapid
    economic growth, population peak in 2050, technology introduction).
  9: Regression analysis with share of burned area as the dependent variable, using
    temperature and precipitation as independent variables; Includes time fixed effects,
    municipality fixed effects, and municipality trends; Analysis performed on 3,983
    observations; Estimates are coefficients with robust standard errors
  10: The study estimates the future cost to the tourism sector due to increased burned
    areas, projecting impacts on domestic tourist arrivals in 2030 and 2050. The A1B
    scenario is used, and results are interpreted with respect to the average temperature
    and precipitation.
  11: The analysis estimates the impact of burned area projections (based on the A1B
    scenario and interpreted with respect to average temperature and precipitation
    of the period studied) on domestic and inbound tourist arrivals and subsequently
    on hotel revenues.
  13: Tourist arrivals were analyzed using municipality-level data in Portugal with
    considerations for burned areas. The econometric model includes robustness checks,
    like adding weather conditions and testing for simultaneity bias using Seemingly
    Unrelated Regressions (SUR).
  16: Analysis using fixed-effects linear panel models with heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation,
    and spatial correlation robust inference; results apply to tourist arrivals data.
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on the case of Portugal, where tourism represents an important
    portion of GDP and employment, and climate change scenarios suggest the severity
    of forest fires will increase.
  4: This page focuses on the impact of fires, particularly wildfires, on tourism
    and related economic activities. While it discusses economic losses and the impact
    on businesses, it doesn't directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes
    at a national level or the costs and benefits of nationwide adaptation strategies.
    It mainly presents case studies and frameworks for assessing the economic impact
    of fires on specific sectors, but doesn't offer the kind of broad economic modelling
    results that your review requires.
  5: The study uses data from Portugal, but specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes,
    or the costs and benefits of adaptation, are not discussed on this page. The analysis
    focuses on the impact of environmental factors on tourism.
  6: The analysis includes controlling for municipality-specific and time-specific
    fixed effects to adjust for unobserved regional characteristics and common temporal
    changes.
  7: The study uses data on population density and crime rate as control variables,
    but these were found to be either marginally or not statistically significant.
    The lag of the dependent variable (tourist arrivals) is significant, suggesting
    a 'word of mouth' effect.
  8: "The study focuses on Portugal. The impact of burned areas is analyzed with a\
    \ one-year lag. Lambda is the Mill\u2019s inverse ratio from equation (2)."
  9: The study also attempted to include wind speed, but the results were not sensible
    and excluded; The results for temperature and precipitation are slightly different
    when using annual average values instead of third quartile values, but those results
    are available upon request.
  10: The results are presented at the municipality level. The paper focuses on the
    tourism sector. The impacts are specified as the 'exposure of results' for each
    municipality.
  11: Some municipalities may benefit from weather condition changes, but this effect
    diminishes over time. The A1B scenario is used for projections.
