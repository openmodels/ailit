Drivers of Risk:
  208: No relevant information
  230: Global warming enhances pest invasions affecting national and regional economies.
  234: Invasive fruit fly species expanding their geographic distribution; introduction
    of new pests.
  243: Invasive fruit fly species, establishment of tephritid species.
  244: Impact of invasive species, namely fruit flies in California, is noted, which
    may indirectly relate to climate change effects influencing invasion dynamics.
  252: Human mobility, fresh fruit and vegetables trading, climate change, and probably
    other factors
  362: Introduction of the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly). Climatic models predict
    that the medfly can spread even further through accidental introductions and establish
    in areas currently free of the pest.

Highlights:
  208: No relevant information
  230: Pest invasions, particularly fruit flies, have profound impacts on economies,
    ecosystems, and agricultural patterns.
  243: Invasive fruit flies can cause significant economic damage to fruit and vegetable
    production, leading to abandonment of crops and requiring costly management efforts.
    Specific examples with cost estimates are provided for Australia, the Middle East,
    and California.
  244: Extensive costs associated with fruit fly invasion management and eradication
    in California are emphasized, potentially highlighting indirect climate change-related
    risks.
  416: No relevant information
  426: There is a strong positive interaction between trapping and the Sterile Insect
    Technique (SIT), such that modest amounts of daily trapping drastically reduce
    the required number of sterile males to achieve population control; The simultaneous
    use of trapping with methyl eugenol and the release of sterile males makes it
    feasible that control can be achieved even if mating occurs before trapping.
  435: Quarantine against Mexican oranges was potentially a protectionist measure
    rather than a biologically necessary one; strategies for pest management included
    orchard management, destruction of fallen fruit, and biocontrol.
  510: No relevant information
  582: Increasing detection trap density reduces the size of the population at the
    time of detection, potentially lowering eradication costs. However, higher trap
    densities also increase survey costs. Sterile male release programs can allow
    for lower trap densities while maintaining effective control.
  604: A pest-free area resulted in US $10.3 million in citrus exports to the US and
    generated 2000 jobs per year valued at US $3.2 million.
  622: Accurate diagnostics must be aligned with any trapping program; cryptic complexes
    can confuse things; it is easy to make mistakes.
  628: The eradication campaign of B. papayae from Australia was considered a success.
    The presence of B. papayae in Thailand leads to market access restrictions, such
    as Taiwan restricting rambutan imports from Thailand.

More Notes:
  208: This page presents an analysis of tephritid fly dispersal, using mark-release-recapture
    studies and examining the relationship between sampling area/distance and recapture
    distances. This is unrelated to macroeconomic/fiscal risks of climate change or
    the costs/benefits of adaptation.
  230: No relevant information
  234: Invasive fruit flies may have major effects on the ecology of native species
    and intensive eradication campaigns can contribute to emergence of secondary pests.
  252: The paper discusses the importance of data sharing and transparency regarding
    detections and interceptions of fruit flies for fast reaction and in-depth analysis;
    Emphasizes the need for a long-lasting extensive and intensive strategy against
    invasive fruit fly species at regional, continental, or even the global level.
  416: This page models the population dynamics of Bactrocera dorsalis (fruit fly)
    and methods for its control using trapping and sterile male releases, which has
    no direct relevance to the macroeconomic or macro-fiscal impacts of climate change,
    or national adaptation strategies. The cited papers Barclay et al. (2014) and
    Barclay and Hendrichs (2014) might be useful to find but do not appear to have
    relevant information on this page.
  426: This paper focuses on pest control using trapping and sterile male releases.
    It does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks of climate change
    or the costs and benefits of adaptation at a national level. The applicability
    of the model could be relevant if climate change is driving pest infestations
    that have a significant economic impact.
  435: The paper discusses the historical context of fruit fly infestations and the
    early development of pest control measures, including the use of pesticides and
    quarantine strategies.
  510: This page describes fruit fly eradication programs, likely Bactrocera tryoni
    and Bactrocera frauenfeldi, in Okinawa and Cook Islands. It mentions various methods
    including bait application (fipronil), cue-lure, sterile insect technique (SIT),
    crop sanitation, and dispenser use. It doesn't explicitly relate to the macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal impacts of climate change or adaptation costs and benefits at
    a national level.
  582: The text describes a trade-off between the costs of detection and eradication.
    The graph is conceptual, and the findings are specific to C. capitata control
    programs and their cost-benefit analysis. There is no apparent translation of
    this information onto nationwide adaptation, GDP effects, productivity loss, or
    the other factors of the global analytical synthesis mentioned in your prompt.
  592: The geographical focus of Pierre (2007) is limited to Florida, USA. It might
    be relevant if the scope of the global review includes sub-national analyses,
    or as a case study.
  622: This example illustrates the potential for errors in species identification
    and its economic consequences, even in dedicated taxonomy labs. The global impact
    of the mistake was minor, but it was major for the people of the Gazelle Peninsular.
  628: The close relationship between B. papayae and B. dorsalis complicates quarantine
    efforts, as B. dorsalis is endemic to Taiwan.
