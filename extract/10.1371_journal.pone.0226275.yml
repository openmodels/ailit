Drivers of Risk:
  1: Storm surge and sea level rise are impacting coastal communities, properties,
    and ecosystems.
  2: Storm surge, sea level rise (SLR), changes in tidal range, salinity, and sediment
    supply.
  3: Coastal flooding, storm wind-driven wave effects, hurricanes, sea-level rise
    impacts on coastal wetlands and marshes.
  4: Coastal flood hazards from storm surge and sea level rise (SLR).
  5: Storm surge and waves from historical (Hurricane Sandy) and synthetic storms
    (25-year and 50-year storms), and sea level rise.
  6: The primary driver of risk is sea level rise (SLR), with contributing factors
    including coastal elevation, LULC (Land Use Land Cover), shoreline information,
    wave action, accretion rate, and tidal range.
  7: Storm events and future land use/land cover (LULC) conditions, sea level rise
    (SLR)
  8: Sea Level Rise (SLR), storms (25-year, 50-year, Sandy)
  9: Flooding events influenced by storm surges, specifically Hurricane Sandy.
  10: Sea level rise (SLR) and different storm events (25-year, 50-year, Hurricane
    Sandy) are the drivers of risk.
  11: Storm surge flooding, sea level rise (SLR), storm characteristics (track, location,
    intensity).
  12: Storm surge, sea level rise.
  13: Hurricane surge flooding, sea-level rise

    from coastal flooding.
  4: This study values natural habitats for enhancing coastal resilience in southeastern
    New Jersey, encompassing the lower Barnegat Bay, Little Egg Harbor, Great Bay,
    and inland back-bays. The study area is vulnerable to coastal flood hazards from
    storm surge and SLR.

    and sea level rise.
  13: Valuing natural habitats for enhancing coastal resilience
  16: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: Natural habitats like salt marshes can significantly mitigate flooding and property
    damage, with potential damage avoidance of up to $32.1 million.
  2: Aims to integrate the natural variability of coastal storm surge and impacts
    of SLR on natural habitats into the economic valuation of flood protection services.
  3: 'Improves upon existing literature by: using parcel-level property values, accounting
    for storm wind-driven wave effects, and incorporating SLR impacts on coastal wetlands
    and marshes.'
  5: Model accounts for storm surge, waves and SLR impacts on coastal habitats. It
    models interaction between storm waves and wetlands. Hurricane Sandy (2012) used
    as the historical storm. The study area is along the coast of New Jersey, including
    Burlington, Ocean, and Atlantic Counties.
  6: SLAMM is used to project a total 0.1332m of SLR in the year 2050 for the study
    area and assess the impact on wetland conversions and shoreline modifications.
  7: Coastal wetlands and marshes provide shoreline protection, reducing flood damages
    to residential properties. SLR will reduce total marsh area.
  8: The presence of natural habitats can significantly reduce flooding and property
    damage under both current and future climate conditions.
  9: Natural habitats, such as coastal wetlands and marshes, can lower flood elevations
    by 0.2 to 0.4 meters and reduce property damage significantly.
  10: Natural habitats provide significant flood protection services, reducing residential
    property damage during storm events. The value of these services varies depending
    on the storm event and sea level rise scenario. The per-area flood protection
    value can vary from $34,000/km2 to $138,000/km2.
  11: Wetlands and marshes reduce property damage from storm surges, with higher efficacy
    during relatively frequent, low-intensity storms. Sea level rise is predicted
    to cause marsh migration and loss of marsh area.
  12: Natural habitats can reduce both storm surge flood depth and property damage;
    they may offer better protection from relatively frequent, low intensity storms;
    natural habitats can increase resilience in areas vulnerable to storm surge and
    sea level rise.

Methodology:
  1: Combined coastal storm surge modeling and economic analysis; utilized ADCIRC+SWAN
    models and SLAMM for future scenario projections.
  2: Uses a coupled version of the Advanced Circulation model (ADCIRC) and Simulating
    Waves Nearshore model (SWAN) to compute storm surge flooding for historical and
    synthetic storms. The Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) is used to simulate
    changes in natural habitats due to SLR. Flood depths are combined with parcel-level
    property data to compute flood damages. The reduction in damages due to the presence
    of natural habitats is estimated.
  3: An interdisciplinary team of coastal engineers, marine and social scientists
    collaborated with natural resources managers to value natural habitats for coastal
    resilience and support natural habitats restoration initiatives.
  4: The study uses a coupled ADCIRC and SWAN model to simulate coastal flooding from
    storm surge and waves. ADCIRC computes water surface elevation and currents, while
    SWAN computes the wave spectrum, incorporating wave breaking, shoaling, refraction,
    and wind-induced wave generation. The models use the same computational mesh,
    domain, and boundary. A FEMA Region II mesh was used to estimate flood depth.
    Land use and land cover (LULC) information is collected from the Coastal Change
    Analysis Program (C-CAP) database. Frictional drag coefficients are used to represent
    LULC in the model.
  5: "Storm surge and wave modeling, SLAMM model for marsh migration projection due\
    \ to SLR. Historical and synthetic storms selected based on recommendations by\
    \ protected area managers. SLR projection uses mid-century (2050) projection.\
    \ Representation of vegetated canopies uses Manning\u2019s n, but does not explicitly\
    \ account for vegetation heights, density or diameter. It explicitly models wave\
    \ dissipation and attenuation by vegetation."
  6: The analysis uses the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) to simulate the
    impact of SLR on coastal ecosystems. The model uses LULC data from the USFWS National
    Wetlands Inventory (NWI), a 10-meter resolution DEM from the USGS National Elevation
    Dataset, and tidal information from NOAA. The model simulates wetland conversions
    and shoreline modification based on SLR, coastal elevation, LULC, shoreline information,
    wave action, accretion rate, and tidal range. The start date for the DEM and NWI
    in the SLAMM model is set to the year 2010. The applicability of SLAMM is limited
    by its simplification of complex marsh dynamics and its reliance on readily available
    but potentially coarse data.
  7: The damages avoided method was applied, comparing flood damages to residential
    properties in "habitat present" vs. "habitat absent" scenarios simulated using
    ADCIRC+SWAN. Flood damages were estimated using depth-damage functions from the
    USACE, parcel level property data from the New Jersey Department of Treasury,
    and mean flood depth from ADCIRC+SWAN. ArcStormSurge in ArcGIS was used to create
    flood elevation rasters. Parcel data were filtered to include only residential
    parcels with improvement value (building value) data.
  8: SLAMM (Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model) was used to simulate land cover change.
    ADCIRC+SWAN was used to assess flooding impacts.
  9: The analysis uses the ADCIRC+SWAN model to simulate flooding with and without
    natural habitats for various storm events, evaluating both current and future
    conditions.
  10: The analysis is place-based and focuses on coastal wetlands and marshes within
    and adjacent to the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve (JCNERR)
    in three coastal counties in New Jersey.
  11: The study uses hydrodynamic and wave models to simulate storm surges and their
    interaction with natural habitats. It considers different storm events and SLR
    conditions. The SLAMM model addresses eco-geomorphic feedbacks in the coastal
    marshes. The study uses a coupled version of the hydrodynamic and wave model to
    address energy and momentum loss of combined surge and waves by vegetation features.
    Results are applicable to the study area.
  12: The study used the relative difference between two scenarios using the same
    model formulation to estimate the potential of natural habitats to reduce flood
    depth. Only three storm events were considered.

More Notes:
  2: Study area is the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve (JCNERR)
    and three coastal counties in New Jersey.
  3: Study area is the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve (JCNERR)
    and surrounding counties in New Jersey.
  5: Model improvement beyond the scope of the study. Details on model forcing and
    parameters are provided in S1 File.
  6: The paper acknowledges uncertainties and limitations in projecting future SLR
    and coastal landscape response. The study uses an average accretion rate of 4
    mm/year due to the inadequacy of existing literature.
  7: The study area includes a range of residential property values, from rural inland
    watershed homes to oceanfront homes on barrier islands.
  8: The 25-year and 50-year storm events are simulated under 'current' and '2050
    SLR' scenarios.
  10: The per-area value of protective services for Sandy and the 50-year storm increased
    in the SLR scenario, but decreased for the 25-year storm.
  11: The variation in building values and flood protection suggests that a parcel-scale
    analysis is necessary. The model does not account for different plant characteristics
    and their wave dissipation mechanisms. Tidal mud-flats are predicted to increase
    and can be erosive during storm events.
  12: The study only analyzed the protection to residential structures, suggesting
    the ecosystem service values are conservative estimates. There is a need for improved
    understanding about the biophysical interactions between natural habitats, extreme
    flooding events, sea level rise, and the sustainability of these natural ecosystems
    in the future.
  16: This page consists solely of references; the paper itself would need to be reviewed
    to determine specific contributions to the National Climate Assessment.
Quantitative material:
  1: Salt marshes can reduce up to 14% of both flood depth and property damage.
  2: The goal of our study was to estimate the value of flood protection services
    provided by protected coastal wetlands and marshes adjacent to the Jacques Cousteau
    National Estuarine Research Reserve (JCNERR) to a cross-section of three coastal
    counties in New Jersey.
  3: Uses parcel-level property values when estimating avoided damages, contributing
    to more spatially explicit results; Suggested that wave setup contributed to 17%
    of the peak water level during most hurricane events during 1988-2015 in the US
    coast.
  4: Coastal marshes cover more than 28% of the reserve area. Less than 2% of the
    total area is currently developed. More than 50% of the JCNERR is bounded by open
    water habitats. Inland resolution of the model is 30 to 500 meters.
  5: "Synthetic storms have a 4% (\u201C25-year storm\u201D) and 2% (\u201C50-year\
    \ storm\u201D) respective probability of occurrence in any given year."
  6: 'Table 1 provides data on storm characteristics: Sandy (Pressure: 940 mb, Speed:
    100 kt, Radius: 80 nm), 50-year storm (Pressure: 970 mb, Speed: 84 kt, Radius:
    22 nm), and 25-year storm (Pressure: 986 mb, Speed: 64 kt, Radius: 26 nm). The
    study also uses a SLR rate of 1.7 millimeters per year and an average accretion
    rate of 4 millimeters per year in the SLAMM model. The model estimates a total
    of 0.1332m of SLR in the year 2050 for the study area.'
  7: Total marsh area predicted to reduce by about 5.4% due to SLR and marsh migration;
    transitional salt marshes and irregularly flooded marshes are predicted to decrease
    by around 38% and 36%, respectively.
  8: SLAMM simulated land cover change percentages; percent reduction in flooded residential
    parcels (up to 23.1% current, 3.7% future); percent reduction in mean parcel-level
    flood depths (up to 4.8% current, 13.9% future); percent decrease in mean proportional
    property damages (up to 4.4% current, 4.0% future); change of number of flooded
    parcels in the 25-year storm with habitat present compared to absent, and respective
    changes of the mean parcel level flood depth and of the percentage of property
    damage in each scenario; same information is reported for a 50-year storm and
    for Sandy, under the current and 2050 SLR scenarios.
  9: Natural habitats can reduce total property damage by up to 13.8% under current
    conditions and up to 6.1% under future conditions, with avoided damages ranging
    from $8,500,000 to $13,000,000 now and $1,500,000 to $32,000,000 under 2050 conditions.
  10: Presence of natural habitats leads to 1.25% avoided damage in the 2050 Sandy
    storm scenario.
  11: Natural habitats can reduce total property damage from storm surge flooding
    by 6.1% to 13.8% within the study area. Flood depth reduction of 0.2 to 0.4m is
    found due to the presence of natural habitats in the JCNERR. A loss of 5.4% of
    the total marsh area in the study area is predicted due to SLR by 2050.
  12: The results found large difference between maximum and average reduction in
    flood elevation due to presence of the natural habitats.
