Drivers of Risk:
  1: Storm surge and sea level rise (SLR).
  2: Coastal flooding from storm surge and sea level rise (SLR) are the main drivers
    of risk. The study also integrates the natural variability of coastal storm surge
    and impacts of SLR on natural habitats.
  5: Storm surges (Hurricane Sandy, synthetic 25-year and 50-year storms) and sea
    level rise (SLR) are identified as key drivers of risk.
  9: Storm events (Hurricane Sandy, 25-year storm, 50-year storm), sea level rise.
  10: Sea Level Rise (SLR), storm frequency and intensity (25-year storm, 50-year
    storm, Hurricane Sandy).
  11: Storm surge flooding, sea level rise (SLR).
  12: Storm surge and sea level rise.
Highlights:
  1: Protecting and preserving natural habitats can contribute to enhance coastal
    resilience.
  2: The study aims to estimate the flood protection services of wetlands by modelling
    the reduction in flood damages to protected residential properties based on the
    presence of natural habitats. The study takes into account storm surge, SLR, and
    the habitat's response to SLR.
  9: Natural habitats reduce flood elevation and property damage during storm events;
    flood protection value is highest in terms of absolute value for the 50-year storm
    and Hurricane Sandy under current and 2050 conditions; the percentage changes
    in flood protection are highest under the 50-year storm event for both temporal
    conditions.
  10: The per square kilometer value of flood protection services varies from a maximum
    of $53,000 to $138,000 under current and future conditions.
  11: Natural habitats in coastal areas provide flood protection during recurrent
    flooding events and act as a first line of defense in extreme storm events; marsh
    migration and transition will lead to a loss of 5.4% of the total marsh area in
    the study area by 2050 due to SLR.
  12: Natural habitats can reduce both storm surge flood depth and property damage.
    Natural habitats may offer better protection from relatively frequent, low-intensity
    storms. The multidisciplinary framework can assist in the development of sustainable
    strategies to protect coastal communities, properties, and ecosystems.
Methodology:
  1: Combined coastal storm surge modeling and economic analysis to evaluate the role
    of natural habitats in coastal flood protection; used ADCIRC+SWAN to simulate
    flooding from historical and synthetic storms; used SLAMM to project potential
    migration and habitat transformation in coastal marshes due to SLR in the year
    2050; counterfactual land cover approach implemented.
  2: The study applies the coupled version of the Advanced Circulation model (ADCIRC)
    and Simulating Waves Nearshore model (SWAN) to compute storm surge flooding for
    historical and synthetic storms. The Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM)
    is used to simulate potential changes in the natural habitats, especially coastal
    wetlands and marshes, due to SLR.
  5: The study uses storm surge and wave modeling, including historical and synthetic
    storms. It also uses SLAMM (Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model) to project changes
    in natural habitats due to SLR in 2050.
  9: ADCIRC+SWAN model used to simulate flooding with and without habitat presence;
    ecosystem service valuation used to suggest reduction in total property damage.
  10: Place-based analysis focused on flood protection services by coastal wetlands
    and marshes within and adjacent to the JCNERR (Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine
    Research Reserve) to a cross-section of three coastal counties in New Jersey.
    Analysis estimates property damage with and without the presence of natural habitats.
  11: Hydrodynamic and wave model coupled with vegetation features; SLAMM model to
    address eco-geomorphic feedbacks in coastal marshes.
  12: The study uses model formulation to estimate the potential of natural habitats
    to reduce flood depth by comparing two scenarios. It focuses on the relative difference
    between scenarios using the same model to minimize the impact of model parameterization
    on the analysis. The model considered three storm events.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on three coastal counties in New Jersey adjacent to the Jacques
    Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve (JCNERR).
  5: The study focuses on valuing natural habitats for enhancing coastal resilience,
    specifically in New Jersey. It acknowledges the importance of wave dissipation
    and attenuation by vegetation but states that improvement of model parameters
    and processes is beyond the scope of their study.
  9: The analysis is specific to the JCNERR area and may not be generalizable to all
    coastal regions.
  10: The protective services for Sandy and the 50-year storm increased in the SLR
    scenario, while the value decreased for the 25-year storm. Results suggest that
    one square kilometer of natural habitats can reduce residential property damages
    from $34,000 to $53,000 per square kilometer under current conditions and from
    $7,000 to $138,000 per square kilometer under future conditions for the selected
    storm events.
  11: The effectiveness of natural flood protection is higher during relatively frequent,
    low-intensity storms.  Parcel-scale analysis is necessary to capture the spatial
    variation of property values when assessing the flood protection services of coastal
    wetlands and marshes. Model doesn't account for different plant characteristics
    and their wave dissipation mechanisms. Tidal mud-flats are predicted to increase
    nearly twenty-six-fold due to SLR, which can affect the morphology of the natural
    habitat areas, as these tidal mud-flats are erosive during storm events.
  12: The study acknowledges that it only analyzes the protection to residential structures,
    suggesting conservative estimates of ecosystem service values. The study calls
    for primary data collection in coastal wetlands and marshes during storm events
    for improved quantification of their flood reduction capacity. The study focuses
    on flood protection, acknowledging that natural habitats provide several ecosystem
    services beyond flood protection.

  14: This page primarily focuses on the valuation of natural habitats, specifically
    coastal wetlands, for enhancing coastal resilience to storm surges and sea-level
    rise. It does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes like
    GDP effects, budget balance, or inflation at a national level. While it touches
    upon the economic value of ecosystem services, it doesn't quantify the broader
    macroeconomic implications of adaptation measures.

  1: Residential property damage (in monetary terms).
  2: The study estimates the value of flood protection services provided by protected
    coastal wetlands and marshes to a cross-section of three coastal counties in New
    Jersey by computing flood damages to properties.
  5: The paper studies coastal resilience in the face of storm surges and sea level
    rise, suggesting a potential impact on economic activity in coastal areas and
    potential adaptation benefits related to natural habitats.
  9: Total property damage, flood elevation, flood depth.
  10: Residential property damage avoided due to natural habitats providing flood
    protection services.

    2050 SLR scenario\u2019, respectively."
  2: The study will combine simulated flood depths with publicly available parcel-level
    property data to compute flood damages for selected storms in both current and
    future conditions.
  9: Coastal wetlands and marshes in the JCNERR can lower flood elevation by a maximum
    of 0.2 to 0.4 meters; average reduction in flood elevation/depth varies from 0.03
    to 0.06m; natural habitats can reduce total property damage by up to 13.8% under
    current conditions and up to 6.1% in future conditions; avoided damage by natural
    habitats during a single storm can range from $8,500,000 to $13,000,000 under
    current conditions, and from $1,500,000 to $32,000,000 under 2050 conditions.
  10: Natural habitats can protect up to $13.1 million and $32.1 million of residential
    property damage during selected storm events in the study area in the current
    condition and the future scenario respectively.
  11: Natural habitats reduce total property damage from storm surge flooding by 6.1%
    to 13.8% within the study area (highest under the 50-year storm event for both
    temporal conditions).
  12: The study mentions differences between maximum and average flood elevation reduction
    due to natural habitats, implying quantifiable differences, but does not provide
    specific values.
