Drivers of Risk:
  1: 1970 cyclone in Bangladesh
  4: Exposure to the 1970 cyclone, the 1971 war, and the 1974 famine in Bangladesh.
  13: Exposure to the 1970 cyclone in Bangladesh.
  15: Exposure to severe climate events/disasters, particularly for those born in
    affected regions.
  18: The 1970 cyclone in Bangladesh has long-term impacts on health, education, and
    consumption outcomes.
  23: Exposure to cyclones, war, and famine are the main drivers of risk examined.
  24: Cyclone exposure interacted with rural location or parental schooling level.
  25: "Cyclone Cohort \xD7 Cyclone Region 1, Cyclone Cohort \xD7 Cyclone Region 2"
  28: Storms and floods, specifically cyclones, are identified as the primary drivers
    impacting rice production and causing deaths.
  29: The graphs are presented by cyclone regions, suggesting cyclones are a driver
    of risk.
  35: Drought, earthquake (ground movement, tsunami), epidemic (uncategorized, bacterial,
    parasitic, viral), extreme temperature (cold wave, heat wave, severe winter conditions),
    flood (uncategorized, coastal, flash, riverine), landslide (landslide, mudslide),
    and storm (uncategorized, convective, tropical cyclone).
  37: Cyclone, War Cohort, Famine Cohort, Location
  39: Shocks include Cyclone, War, and Famine Cohorts, with locational variations
    such as Cyclone Regions and Rural areas.
  41: Cyclone Cohort, War Cohort, Famine Cohort, Cyclone Region 1, Cyclone Region
    2, Location, Gender, Parental Schooling, ALF, Age, Squared Age.
  42: Cyclones, War, Famine.
Highlights:
  1: Children surviving the cyclone experience significant health, schooling and consumption
    adversities in adulthood, including lower probabilities of good health and primary
    schooling, and lower durations of good health, schooling and consumption. These
    adversities are heightened among rural and less-educated households.
  4: Rural poor households experience heightened long-term adversities from childhood
    exposure to disasters; schooling mitigates these outcomes.
  6: The 1970 cyclone was one of the worst disasters in modern times, leading to widespread
    loss of life and property in coastal regions of Bangladesh.
  13: Significant long-term health, schooling, solvency and expenditure adversities
    are identified for the 1969-71 cohorts from Barisal and Noakhali regions from
    their severe exposure to the 1970 cyclone.
  15: Rural households experience greater adverse effects from disasters, particularly
    in educational attainment, likely due to lack of adequate infrastructure. Parental
    education doesn't show a significant mitigating effect, possibly due to low levels
    of parental education in the sample.
  18: Rural and less-educated households are more vulnerable to disaster exposure;
    interventions should focus on improving rural infrastructure, reducing gender
    disparities in livelihood opportunities, and enhancing schooling in disaster-affected
    regions.
  23: Exposure to the 1970 cyclone is associated with positive but generally statistically
    insignificant impacts on health, schooling, and consumption. War exposure generally
    shows negative impacts on health and schooling, but a positive impact on expenditure.
    Famine exposure has mixed effects, including a significant negative impact on
    solvency. The impacts of these shocks are further analyzed and vary by region.
  24: The impact of cyclones on health, schooling, and consumption varies depending
    on whether the individual lives in a rural area or if their parents were educated.
  25: The coefficients for Cyclone Cohort interactions are very small, close to zero
    in both the 25th and 75th percentiles. The standard errors are also shown. Statistical
    significance levels are indicated in the notes.
  28: Storms and floods, particularly around 1970 and 1975, caused significant spikes
    in death tolls. A sharp drop in national rice production occurred around 1970,
    coinciding with a major cyclone (Bhola cyclone). Regional rice production trends
    vary significantly across Barisal, Jessore, Noakhali, and Rajshahi, indicating
    differential vulnerability to climatic events.
  29: The lines in each graph representing the three cyclone regions fluctuate, showing
    variability of the different outcome variables (Healthy, Ln(Health), Educated,
    Ln(Schooling), Solvent, Ln(Expenditure)) over time in response to cyclones.
  35: Tropical cyclones caused the highest number of deaths (626,957), riverine floods
    affected the largest population (138,644,785), and riverine floods resulted in
    the highest damages (7,763,300 thousand US$).
  37: Cyclone exposure has statistically significant impacts on consumption outcomes,
    particularly in specific regions. Conflict and famine cohort status also affects
    consumption outcomes.
  39: Cyclone Cohort impacts health and schooling outcomes more negatively in rural
    and specific cyclone regions, with statistical significance at varying levels.
  41: Cyclone Cohort, War Cohort, and Famine Cohort all have statistically significant
    negative impacts on the 75th percentile of Ln(Health) at the 10%, 5%, and 10%
    significance levels, respectively. Cyclone Region 2 has a statistically significant
    negative impact on the 25th percentile of Ln(Health) at the 5% significance level.
    Gender has a statistically significant positive impact on the 25th percentile
    of Ln(Health) at the 1% significance level. Age and Squared Age have statistically
    significant impacts at the 1% significance levels.
  42: Exposure to Cyclone Cohort has a statistically significant positive impact on
    parental schooling at the regional level.
Methodology:
  1: Uses childhood exposures to the 1970 cyclone as a natural experiment. Looks at
    health, schooling, and consumption outcomes in adulthood based on exposure to
    the cyclone in childhood.
  4: Analysis controls for potential cross-effects of overlapping adverse events to
    identify the net long-term effects of the 1970 cyclone.
  6: The page provides a historical summary and descriptive analysis of the impact
    of the 1970 cyclone in Bangladesh.
  11: "The study uses fixed effects (birthyear, birthplace, and survey year) to control\
    \ for unobserved time-varying factors. It clusters standard errors at the district\
    \ level to address potential correlation in error terms. The core identifying\
    \ assumption is independence between disturbances and exposure to the 1970 cyclone,\
    \ conditional on fixed effects and controls. The study also uses a regression\
    \ model with parameters \u03B21 and \u03B22 to allow for differential effects\
    \ of regions on cyclone cohorts."
  13: Regression analysis is performed on data from 1964-1980.
  15: Statistical analysis comparing outcomes for rural vs. urban households and those
    with educated vs. uneducated parents, focusing on the impact of climate-related
    disasters.
  23: Regression analysis is used to estimate the long-term impacts of exposure to
    the 1970 cyclone, war, and famine during childhood on health, schooling, and consumption.
    The regressions include control variables, year fixed effects, subdivision/thana
    fixed effects, and survey year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at
    the district level.
  24: Regression analysis using empirical specification (4), including interactions
    between cyclone exposure, rural location/parental schooling, cyclone cohort, and
    cyclone region. Standard errors are clustered at the district level. Significance
    levels are reported. Detailed results reported in Tables A.4 and A.5.
  25: Regressions based on empirical specification (2) with control variables, Year
    FE, Thana FE, and HIES FE. Statistical significance at 1%, 5% and 10% levels represented
    by ***, ** and * respectively.
  28: The analysis uses data on death numbers from EM-DAT database and rice production
    data from the Statistical Yearbook of Bangladesh. Cyclone regions are identified
    based on EM-DAT database and Sommer and Mosley (1972). The period of analysis
    is 1955-1980.
  29: The paper appears to present empirical results showing the trends of different
    economic variables over time (1965-1980) in different cyclone regions. A dashed
    vertical line marks the year 1975.
  35: The data is extracted from the EM-DAT database on April 28, 2020, covering the
    period 1900-2019.
  37: Regression analysis examining the impact of cyclone exposure, conflict, and
    famine on health, schooling, and consumption outcomes, controlling for cohort,
    location, gender, parental schooling, ALF, age, and year/Thana fixed effects.
  39: Analysis uses interaction terms to explore locational variations and includes
    fixed effects for Year, Thana, and HIES with standard errors clustered at the
    district level.
  41: Regressions are based on empirical specification (2) outlined in Section 6.1.
    The regressions include Year, Thana, and HIES fixed effects.
  42: "The analysis uses a regression model (specified as \U0001D453\U0001D456 = \U0001D6FC\
    0 + \U0001D703\U0001D436 + \u2211(\U0001D717\U0001D457\U0001D445\U0001D457) +\
    \ \u2211(\U0001D6FD\U0001D457 \xD7 (\U0001D445\U0001D457 \xD7 \U0001D436)) + \U0001D716\
    \U0001D456) to estimate the impact of exposure to environmental shocks (cyclones,\
    \ war, famine) on fertility choices, measured by parental schooling levels. Standard\
    \ errors are clustered at the district level."
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on individual level outcomes rather than macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes.
  3: This page focuses on microeconomic effects (individual health, schooling, consumption)
    rather than macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes. It does not directly address
    the costs or benefits of adaptation at a national level.
  6: Regions are defined as former districts.
  11: The paper uses data from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES)
    in Bangladesh for the years 2000, 2005, and 2010.
  13: The 1971 war and 1974 famine are considered as potential cross-effects.
  15: The paper emphasizes the importance of infrastructural development as an adaptation
    policy, particularly in rural areas. Location (rural vs. urban) serves as a proxy
    for access to amenities and infrastructure.
  23: The paper investigates the long-term impacts of early-life exposure to shocks.
    The variables are defined in more detail in Tables 1 and 2, and Section 3.3 of
    the paper. Detailed regression results are provided in Table A.3 in the appendix.
    The analysis uses data from Bangladesh.
  24: The table presents variations in the impacts of cyclones on health, schooling,
    and consumption, depending on locational variations (rural vs. urban) and parental
    schooling.
  28: The paper focuses on the impact of historical cyclone events on rice production
    and mortality in Bangladesh; it does not directly address broader macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes, or the costs/benefits of adaptation.
  29: The use of 'Ln' suggests a logarithmic transformation of the 'Health', 'Schooling',
    and 'Expenditure' variables. The description indicates that CR0, CR1, and CR2
    represent different cyclone regions, and that the aim is likely to compare outcomes
    across those regions.
  35: The data for total damages is not available for all disaster subtypes ('--'
    indicates missing data).
  37: The table presents results from two specifications (Eq. 1 and Eq. 2) for each
    outcome, likely representing different model specifications or control variables.
    The inclusion of interaction terms (Cohort x Cyclone, War Cohort x Cyclone) suggests
    the analysis explores heterogeneous effects. Significance levels are indicated
    by asterisks (***, **, *)
  41: The table examines selective mortality across different cohorts and regions
    affected by cyclones, war, and famine. Standard errors are shown in parentheses
    and used to indicate statistical significance at 1, 5, and 10 percent levels.
  42: The dependent variable in the regressions is parental schooling (or fertility).
    The analysis controls for location, gender, ALF (presumably agricultural labor
    force), age, and squared age.
