Highlights:
  1: No relevant information
  13: Between 2000 and 2015 African forest carbon gains increased while Amazonian
    forest carbon gains decreased. Amazonian forests show greater sensitivity to drought
    than African forests.
  15: The carbon sink in African tropical forests is predicted to decline by 14% by
    2030, and the Amazon sink is predicted to reach zero by 2035.
  16: Earth recently passed the point of peak carbon sequestration into intact tropical
    forests
  18: Intact tropical forests' ability to sequester additional carbon is waning. The
    tropical forest carbon sink is set to end sooner than most climate-driven vegetation
    models predict, potentially making climate change impacts in the tropics more
    severe than predicted.
  33: The total carbon sink in the pan-tropics is predicted to decline from 0.87 Pg
    C yr-1 in the 1980s to 0.29 Pg C yr-1 in the 2030-2040 period. The Amazon region
    is expected to experience a substantial decline, potentially becoming a net carbon
    source by 2030-2040. The continental sink in Southeast Asia is a modest and declining
    contribution to the pan-tropical sink.
  34: CO2 change, MAT, MAT change, MCWD, and WD are significant predictors of carbon
    gains, while CO2 change, MAT change, MCWD, and CRT are significant predictors
    of carbon losses. The impact of each predictor variable on carbon gains and losses
    is quantified, including the estimated percentage change between 2000 and 2015.

  44: 'Dead tree biomass in 1990 in African forests: 1.95 Mg C ha-1, of which ~50%
    was released to the atmosphere after 4 years, ~85% after 10 years, and ~97% after
    20 years.'
  45: No relevant information
  51: Carbon gains increased due to CO2 increase, while temperature rises lead to
    a decline in gains. The Amazon carbon sink is predicted to reach zero by 2041
    (model averaged) or 2035 (best-ranked model).
  52: Estimation of future carbon gain, loss, and net carbon sink through modeling
    and confidence intervals.
  54: Future sink strength is sensitive to future environmental conditions, and a
    decline in sink strength in both continents is projected over the 2020s under
    both RCP scenarios.
  63: Changes in MCWD have no relationship to carbon gains over intervals longer than
    1 year.
  65: The change in carbon losses is related to carbon residence time (CRT) with varying
    statistical significance (p=0.025 and p=0.124). A vertical dashed line appears
    at x = 76.8 years.
Methodology:
  1: No relevant information
  15: Carbon gain and loss models are used to estimate the future size of the per
    unit area intact forest carbon sink, based on extrapolations of predictor variables
    from 1983-2015 forward to 2040.
  16: Scaling our estimated mean sink strength by forest area for each continent
  33: "The analysis uses plot data to estimate carbon sink, extrapolates to continental\
    \ level using intact forest area data, and uses modeling parameters (from Table\
    \ 2, not included in this page) to predict future carbon sink. Uncertainty is\
    \ quantified using bootstrapped confidence intervals (historical) and 2\u03C3\
    \ for predictions."
  34: Minimum adequate models are used to predict carbon gains and losses. The 2000-2015
    change in gains/losses for each predictor variable was estimated allowing only
    the focal predictor to vary and expressed as a percentage of the annual gains/losses
    in the year 2000.
  39: The paper describes a methodology for estimating net carbon sink (Mg C ha-1
    yr-1) by calculating carbon gains and losses in forests, accounting for biases
    due to census interval length.
  43: Calculates the continental-scale total carbon sink by multiplying the per unit
    area total net carbon sink by the area of intact forest on each continent. Estimates
    intact forest area using an exponential model fitted to 1990-2010 data. Calculates
    the proportion of anthropogenic CO2 emissions removed by dividing the total pan-tropical
    carbon sink by the total anthropogenic CO2 emissions.
  44: The study calculates carbon release to the atmosphere from dead trees based
    on an exponential decay model with a decomposition rate of -0.17 yr-1 for tropical
    forests. It then sums the carbon contributions released in a given year from past
    years' forest carbon losses.
  45: Using census intervals to estimate environmental predictor variables to remove
    seasonal effects; census interval length rounded to the nearest complete year;
    dates computed to minimise difference between actual fieldwork and complete-year
    census dates; interval-specific means calculated for environmental predictor variables
  51: Model-averaging and best-ranked models are used to predict carbon gains and
    losses based on predictor variables (CO2-change, MAT, MAT-change, MCWD, WD and
    CRT) from 1983-2040, using observed trends from 1983-2014 in Africa and 1983-2011.5
    in Amazonia.
  52: Linear regression models using historical data from Africa and Amazonia to predict
    future carbon dynamics and their uncertainties.
  54: Uses modified slopes and RCP scenarios to project future sink strength
  63: Statistical analysis of scatterplots relating CRT and WD to carbon gains and
    losses. AIC minimum used to determine prior interval for MAT-change parameter
    calculation (5 years). Correlation slope used to determine the relationship between
    carbon gains and changes in MCWD.
  65: "Linear trends are estimated on data from 1983-2014 (Africa) or 1983-2011 (Amazon)\
    \ to project future values. The change in carbon losses is calculated as the difference\
    \ in carbon losses between subsequent census intervals, divided by the time difference.\
    \ Upper and lower confidence intervals are calculated by adding and subtracting\
    \ 2\u03C3 to the mean of each annual value (past) or from the slope of the regression\
    \ model (future)."
More Notes:
  1: No relevant information
  13: The study suggests that trees only partially acclimate to recently rising temperatures,
    reducing growth. The link between wood density and carbon gains may relate to
    below-ground resource availability or disturbance regimes.
  15: The estimates are sensitive to future CO2 emissions pathways, temperature increases,
    hydrological changes, and changes in forest dynamics. The increase in carbon losses
    in African forests is expected to lag behind Amazonian losses by 10-15 years.
  16: "The carbon sink strength of the world\u2019s two most extensive tropical forests\
    \ have now saturated, albeit asynchronously."
  33: The analysis includes estimates of trees <100 mm DBH, lianas, and roots in the
    total carbon sink calculation.
  34: Carbon loss values were normalized using a power-law transformation. The analysis
    is specific to African and Amazonian tropical forests.
  39: The focus is on carbon accounting within forests, which is not directly tied
    to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level but it would relate
    to avoided costs of carbon emissions, and could be an input into a broader climate-economic
    model.
  44: The analysis focuses on the carbon cycle within forests and its contribution
    to atmospheric carbon. It provides a detailed model of carbon release from decomposing
    trees, but does not directly address macroeconomic or fiscal risks or adaptation
    costs and benefits.
  45: This page focuses on the methodology for controlling for seasonal variability
    when assessing the impact of environmental predictor variables (CO2 concentration,
    temperature, drought) on some unspecified ecological outcome (appears to be related
    to 'carbon gains' and is not macro-economic)
  51: This analysis focuses on carbon sinks in Africa and Amazonia and does not address
    economy-wide macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  54: The paper focuses on carbon sinks in continents rather than direct macroeconomic/fiscal
    outcomes at a national level. The link between carbon sink declines and macroeconomic/fiscal
    risks needs to be inferred (e.g., through impacts on agriculture, forestry, or
    other ecosystem services).
  63: The analysis focuses on tree growth in the context of climate variables. The
    link to macroeconomic outcomes would need to be inferred or modeled separately.
    The study does not include adaptation.
  65: The study focuses on African and Amazonian intact tropical forests. The relationship
    between climate variables and carbon dynamics is examined using plot networks.

  13: African forest carbon gains increased by 3.1% between 2000 and 2015 compared
    to a 0.1% decline in Amazonia. In Africa, from 2000 to 2015, there was a 3.7%
    increase from CO2-change, a 0.5% decrease from droughts, and a 0.1% decrease from
    temperature increases. For Amazonia, there was a 3.7% increase due to CO2-change,
    and a 2.7% decrease due to droughts.
  15: "By 2030 the carbon sink in aboveground live biomass in intact African tropical\
    \ forest is predicted to decline by 14% from the measured 2010-15 mean, to 0.57\
    \ Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (2\u03C3 range, 0.16-0.96). The Amazon sink continues to decline,\

    yr-1 decade-1)
  18: The intact tropical forest carbon sink weakened by ~0.2 Pg C yr-1 between the
    1990s and 2000s, and 0.17 Pg C yr-1 weakening over the same period in this study.
    Intact forests removed 17% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the 1990s, declining
    to 6% in the 2010s. The pan-tropical weighted average per unit area sink strength
    declined by 33%, forest area decreased by 19%, and CO2 emissions increased by
    46%.

  51: From 2000 to 2015, carbon gains increased due to CO2-change (+3.7% in both the
    averaged and the best-ranked models, both continents), temperature rises led to
    a decline in gains, which especially had an effect in the Amazon (-1.14% and -1.07%
    due to MAT and MAT-change together in the averaged and best-ranked model respectively);
    Future net sink trend in Africa is -0.004 and -0.003 in the best-ranked and averaged
    models respectively; In Amazonia the future net sink trend is -0.013 and -0.011
