Drivers of Risk:
  1: Projected increase in the magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events
    in the Northeastern US.
  10: Changes in precipitation patterns, particularly extreme precipitation events,
    are drivers of risk, as these impact infrastructure through probability of failure
    (PF).
  13: The driver of risk is climate change, specifically represented by the RCP8.5
    emission scenario, leading to altered precipitation patterns and increased flood
    risk.
  16: Climate change, specifically under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, leading to changes
    in the frequency of extreme weather events.
Highlights:
  1: Exceedance probability of a 100-year event may increase with climate change,
    potentially changing to a 27-year event under RCP4.5 and a 19-year event under
    RCP8.5.
  10: LOCA data, despite biases, could be useful for PF estimates after bias correction.
    UWPD outperforms the other data sets for all return periods. Dynamically downscaled
    NA-CORDEX shows comparable skill, although with larger uncertainties. Skills of
    the downscaled datasets decrease as return periods increase.
  13: "Under RCP8.5 the mean change ratios in flood return periods increase from 2006-2053\
    \ to 2054-2100. Under the low emission scenario RCP4.5 for the first half of the\
    \ 21st century, for a return period of 25 years, flood estimates increase by a\
    \ mean relative ratio of 0.09, which translates to a 9% increase. New Jersey and\
    \ the southeast corner of New York experience the smallest change (0%\u20135%),\
    \ while the area north of Maine experiences the largest change (20%\u201330%)."
  16: Extreme weather events in the Northeastern US are projected to become more frequent
    in the future under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The change is quite significant
    even under RCP8.5.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of observed and modeled daily precipitation frequency estimates using
    annual maximum series and partial duration series methods, employing CMIP5 downscaled
    data sets.
  10: The study compares four downscaled climate data sets (UWPD, LOCA, NA-CORDEX,
    BCCAv2) against observed data to assess their skill in predicting extreme precipitation
    events. The skill is quantified using correlation coefficients and RMSE. The data
    is used to calculate probability of failure (PF) estimates using AMS and PDS methods.
  13: The analysis projects future flood return periods using the UWPD and LOCA datasets
    under the RCP8.5 emission scenario, calculating relative differences between future
    and historical flood probabilities. Results are applicable for the first half
    of the 21st century under the RCP4.5 scenario, and for the specified periods under
    RCP 8.5.
  16: Analysis of exceedance probabilities for different return periods using UWPD
    and LOCA datasets under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, comparing historical data
    (1960-2005) with projections for the first (2006-2053) and second (2054-2100)
    halves of the 21st century.
More Notes:
  11: This page primarily describes methodological choices related to downscaled climate
    data and projected precipitation frequency (PF) estimates. It doesn't directly
    address macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, costs, or benefits of adaptation at
    a national level. The focus is on selecting and comparing climate datasets for
    projecting future precipitation patterns.
  16: The results are specific to the Northeastern US. The dry bias in the data is
    acknowledged as a potential influence on the magnitude of changes, although the
    sign of the changes is consistent.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  10: No relevant information
  13: The paper presents projected changes in flood return periods, which can be linked
    to economic costs associated with flood damage and the need for adaptation measures.
  16: While the page focuses on extreme weather events and probabilities, it does
    not explicitly link these to specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes like GDP,
    inflation, or government budgets. No adaptation costs or benefits are detailed
    either.
Quantitative material:
  10: The paper presents Pearson correlation coefficients (R) and Root Mean Square
    Errors (RMSE) comparing observed and downscaled precipitation data for different
    return periods (2-year, 25-year). R values range from 0.70 to 0.74. RMSE values
    range from 43.98 to 52.54.
  13: The paper provides quantitative estimates of the mean relative change ratios
    in flood return periods (25-year, 100-year, and 500-year) for two future periods
    (2006-2053 and 2054-2100) under the RCP8.5 scenario, using both UWP and LOCA data.
  16: "Under the RCP8.5 scenario, the exceedance probability for the 100-year event\
    \ (0.01) will increase to \u22480.04 for the second half of the 21st century in\
    \ the Northeastern US."
