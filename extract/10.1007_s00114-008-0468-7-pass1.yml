Drivers of Risk:
  9: Accumulated stomatal uptake of ozone (AFst6); surface wetness declining and surface
    temperature increasing during warm periods; changes in surface wetness (dependent
    on night-time temperature and evaporative conditions during daytime).
Highlights:
  9: Ozone flux to leaves is partitioned to stomata and to external surfaces, and
    Fst is influenced by surface destruction of ozone, which depends on leaf surface
    characteristics and surface conditions such as wetness.
Methodology:
  9: "Modeling the relationship between relative yield and accumulated stomatal uptake\
    \ of ozone for wheat and potato; using Jarvis-type model, but its application\
    \ limited to conditions representative of those under which the parameterisation\
    \ was performed; alternative semi-empirical method proposed by Ball et al. (1987)\
    \ (Ball\u2013Berry model)."
More Notes:
  9: Climate change effects on stomatal uptake exist. The effect of ozone on stomatal
    behaviour and thus on gs is difficult to quantify.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  9: Relative yield of wheat and potato.
Quantitative material:
  9: "Accumulated stomatal uptake of ozone, per unit projected sunlit leaf area, above\
    \ an ozone uptake rate threshold of 6 nmol O3 m\u22122 s\u22121 until 700\xB0\
    C days after anthesis for wheat and until 1,130\xB0C days after emergence for\
    \ potato."
