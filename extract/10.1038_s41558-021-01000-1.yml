  27: Changes in country-level Total Factor Productivity (TFP) are evaluated, which

  28: Global impact of anthropogenic climate change under a wide range of econometric
    models.
Highlights:
  1: Global agriculture has grown more vulnerable to ongoing climate change.
  2: A key outcome is the visualization of TFP growth doubling since 1961, with significant
    variation between different countries.
  3: A robust relationship between agricultural TFP growth and weather changes is
    found.
  4: "Temperature response becomes steeper in 1989\u20132015 compared to 1962\u2013\
    1988, indicating increased damage from higher temperatures; ACC has resulted in\
    \ a significant cumulative negative impact on TFP growth equivalent to losing\
    \ seven years of productivity growth by 2020."
  5: The findings suggest substantial regional disparities in ACC impacts; warmer
    regions like Africa experience a greater negative impact compared to cooler regions
    such as North America and Europe.
  6: ACC is increasingly reducing agricultural output as we drift away from a climate
    system without human influences, cumulating into a detectable and sizeable impact
    as of 2020.
  8: Developed a response function that shows the impact of temperature and precipitation
    on agricultural TFP growth. The model is specified in growth terms, the inclusion
    of a country-specific dummy variable is analogous to controlling for a linear
    country-specific time trend in ln TFP.
  9: Most model variations have little bearing on the baseline result. Revenue regression
    weights and green season weather aggregation have most impact, indicating slightly
    larger damage. Restricting weather variables to greenest months may reduce measurement
    error. Downweighting smaller countries may improve model fit.

Methodology:
  1: An econometric model of weather effects on global agricultural total factor productivity
    (TFP) is developed and combined with counterfactual climate scenarios to evaluate
    impacts of past climate trends on TFP. The model characterizes f as a quadratic
    function of average temperature (T) and total precipitation (P) over the 5-month
    period centered around the greenest month of the year of each country.
  3: The analysis uses 500 year-by-region block bootstraps. Placebo checks are performed
    by randomly mismatching or reshuffling TFP and weather data by years or country,
    with 10,000 reshuffled datasets.
  4: The analysis involves estimating response functions for temperature and precipitation
    on TFP growth, placebo checks to validate findings, and counterfactual weather
    trajectories from CMIP6 to assess the impact of ACC on TFP.
  5: The analysis utilizes multiple econometric models, including variations in temperature
    variables, functional forms, regression weights, aggregation weights, seasonal
    modeling, and heterogeneity to assess impacts, with cross-validation applied to
    improve fit.
  6: Estimates reflect climate uncertainty (from GCMs), econometric uncertainty (from
    the estimation) and specification uncertainty (from the choice of the econometric
    model).
  7: Total factor productivity estimation (Van Beveren 2012)
  8: Econometric models are used to regress changes in TFP on first differences of
    green-season average temperature and precipitation, controlling for country and
    year fixed effects. CMIP6 climate simulations are used for weather data. A bias-corrected
    spatial disaggregation (BCSD) approach is used to downscale climate data. Block
    bootstrap estimation is used to capture statistical uncertainty.
  9: Econometric model with 296 variations to assess robustness. Subtracts cumulative
    impact of weather trajectory with ACC from trajectory without ACC. Considers different
    temperature variables, inclusion/exclusion of precipitation, quadratic/cubic functional
    forms, regression weights, weather data aggregation methods, green/brown seasons,
    and global/regional response functions. Uses CMIP6 GCMs. Addresses uncertainty
    with bootstrapped coefficients and GCMs.

    \ in one analysis. Employs year-by-region block bootstraps for confidence intervals.\

    fit assessment.
More Notes:
  5: The exclusion of some large countries or temporal subsamples does not significantly
    affect baseline estimates, but there is an indication of increasing agricultural
    sensitivity to climate change over time.
  6: The estimates do not remove the direct effect that rising CO2 concentrations
    have on agricultural production or the presence of agricultural research or carbon-intensive
    inputs. The TFP metric used may mismeasure certain inputs, such as irrigation
    water use.
  8: The TFP metric may mismeasure certain inputs, such as irrigation water use, though
    weather-driven variability in global irrigation withdrawals is estimated as modest.
    Measurement errors in TFP data are unlikely to be correlated with year-to-year
    weather changes, which does not bias results. Classical measurement error in temperature
    and/or precipitation would induce attenuation bias.
  9: Measurement error in TFP uncorrelated with weather introduces imprecision, while
    correlated error introduces bias. Omitted input adjustments like irrigation could
    be problematic. Analysis based on TFP growth rates, not levels.
