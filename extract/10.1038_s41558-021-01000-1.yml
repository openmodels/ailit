Highlights:
  1: Anthropogenic climate change has slowed global agricultural productivity growth,
    with a 21% reduction in global agricultural TFP since 1961.
  2: Average agricultural TFP has more than doubled since 1961 but with wide cross-country
    variation.
  3: Finds a robust relationship between agricultural TFP growth and weather changes.
  4: ACC has had a significant negative impact on global agricultural TFP growth,
    with an estimated cumulative loss of 20.8% between 1961 and 2020. Agriculture
    has become more sensitive to higher temperatures over time.
  5: Anthropogenic climate change has a negative impact on global average TFP, with
    an average reduction of -16.9%. Impacts are larger in warmer regions like Africa
    and the Near East. The impact seems to be growing over time. Using output rather
    than TFP makes the impacts seem more severe.
  6: Anthropogenic climate change is detectably and substantially reducing agricultural
    output as of 2020.
  9: "The adoption of revenue regression weights and a \u2018green season\u2019 for\
    \ weather aggregation represent the two most consequential modeling choices, pointing\
    \ to slightly larger damage from ACC."
  13: Agricultural productivity, measured as TFP, responds to changes in green-season
    temperature and precipitation.

    and precipitation) changes during the green season. Indicates the average green-season
    temperature for selected large countries.
  21: The paper models the response of agricultural productivity (TFP) to changes
    in temperature and precipitation during the green season. It provides response
    functions and confidence bands. It includes placebo tests to check the robustness
    of the relationships.

Methodology:
  1: Econometric model linking country-level TFP growth with weather change (quadratic
    function of average temperature and total precipitation); counterfactual climate
    scenarios; country and year fixed effects; block bootstrap resampling.
  2: Analysis of country-level agricultural TFP growth from 1961-2015, using Global
    Meteorological Forcing Dataset (GMFD) and CMIP6 climate model data.
  3: Uses response functions to assess the impact of temperature and precipitation
    changes on TFP growth; employs 500 year-by-region block bootstraps for confidence
    intervals and placebo checks with random data mismatching or reshuffling.
  4: "Econometric estimates linked with counterfactual weather trajectories from climate\
    \ experiments (CMIP6) with and without ACC to derive the cumulative impact of\
    \ ACC since 1961. Employs placebo checks by reshuffling data to test the robustness\
    \ of findings. Models are estimated using data from 1962-2015 and projections\
    \ to 2020. Estimates models based on the first (1962\u20131988) and second (1989\u2013\
    2015) halves of the sample to assess changes in sensitivity to climatic extremes"
  5: Econometric models with various specifications (temperature variables, functional
    forms, regression weights, aggregation weights, growing season definitions, and
    heterogeneity assumptions) are used. Tenfold cross-validation is employed to assess
    model fit.
  6: Econometric analysis considering climate uncertainty (from GCMs), econometric
    uncertainty (from the estimation), and specification uncertainty (from the choice
    of the econometric model).
  8: The paper uses an econometric model with country and year fixed effects to regress
    TFP growth on temperature and precipitation changes. They use a block bootstrap
    estimation to account for regional dependence. Weather data is bias-corrected
    and spatially disaggregated. The model is applicable to assess the impact of weather
    variations on agricultural TFP.
  9: The paper uses econometric models to estimate the impact of weather (temperature
    and precipitation) on agricultural TFP growth. It then uses General Circulation
    Models (GCMs) to simulate weather trajectories with and without ACC, and calculates
    the cumulative impact of ACC by comparing TFP growth under these different scenarios.
    It accounts for uncertainty from both the econometric model and the climate models.
    They compute counterfactual TFP level trajectories by subtracting the cumulative
    impacts of ACC from observed TFP levels.
  13: The analysis uses country-level data. Response functions are centered vertically
    so that the exposure-weighted marginal effect is zero. Confidence bands are based
    on 500 year-by-region block bootstraps. Placebo checks are performed by randomly
    mismatching/reshuffling TFP and weather data by years and by country. Coefficients
    of linear and quadratic terms of T and P were extracted from 10,000 reshuffled
    datasets to construct distributions.
  15: Regression analysis of TFP on temperature and precipitation with controls. The
    response functions are centered vertically so that the exposure-weighted marginal
    effect is zero. 500 year-by-region block bootstraps are used for confidence bands.
    Placebo checks with randomly mismatched TFP and weather data by year and by country.
  17: The analysis uses country-level data from 1962-1988. Response functions are
    created with the exposure-weighted marginal effect set to zero. Bootstrapping
    (500 year-by-region blocks) is used to generate confidence bands. Placebo checks
    are performed by randomly mismatching/reshuffling TFP and weather data by years
    and by country.
  19: Analysis based on data from 1989-2015, with baseline response function for 1962-2015.

    by country, with 10,000 reshuffled datasets.
  21: Regression analysis of TFP against green-season temperature and precipitation
    for the period 1962-1988. The analysis uses year-by-region and country block bootstraps
    for robustness. Placebo checks are performed by randomly mismatching/reshuffling
    TFP and weather data by years and by country.
  23: Regression analysis using data from 1989-2015. Includes robustness checks using
    placebo tests where TFP and weather data are randomly mismatched/reshuffled by
    years and by country. Analysis performed on country level data, excluding 10%
    of coldest countries. Includes year-by-region block bootstraps to derive confidence
    bands.
  25: Regression analysis is performed using country-level data from 1962-1988, with
    robustness checks including block bootstrapping and placebo tests involving randomly
    mismatched/reshuffled data by year and country.
  27: Regression analysis is used to assess the impact of green-season average temperature
    and total precipitation on country-level TFP. Placebo checks are conducted by
    randomly reshuffling TFP and weather data by year and by country. Block bootstraps
    are used for calculating confidence bands.
  28: Econometric models (298 variations) are used to estimate the global impact of
    ACC. A 10-fold cross-validation is performed to assess model fit (reduction in
    out-of-sample MSE relative to a model excluding weather variables).
More Notes:
  1: The model controls for technological change and estimates the impact of weather
    changes on TFP growth.
  2: The paper explores variations of their model by estimating separate response
    functions for various sub-regions of the world to assess impact on results.
  4: The precipitation response function is non-linear and peaks around 500mm over
    the green season. The temperature response function is roughly linear and downward
    sloping, indicating that warmer temperatures are detrimental to TFP growth. Weather
    shocks do not appear to have a persistent effect on TFP growth.
  5: The study examines the impact of ACC on agriculture, not the effect of a world
    without fossil fuels, since agriculture has benefited from carbon-intensive inputs.
  6: The study acknowledges limitations regarding the TFP metric, including the exclusion
    of the direct effect of rising CO2 concentrations on agricultural production,
    agricultural research, carbon-intensive inputs, measurement error, and mismeasurement
    of inputs like irrigation water use. Ignoring all measured inputs overstates ACC
    impacts.
  9: The study uses data from 1962-2015 for observed TFP, and projects TFP from 2016-2020
    based on the average growth rate over the previous 10 years. The paper conducts
    robustness checks by varying model specifications.

    marginal effect is zero. Placebo tests are conducted by reshuffling data by year
    and by country.

Quantitative material:
  1: "ACC has reduced global agricultural TFP by about 21% since 1961; a reduction\
    \ of ~26\u201334% in warmer regions such as Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean;\
    \ equivalent to losing the last 7 years of productivity growth."
  2: Average agricultural TFP has more than doubled since 1961, but there is wide
    cross-country variation.
  4: 'Cumulative impact of ACC on global agricultural TFP growth over 1961-2020 is
    about -20.8% (90% confidence interval: -39.1% to -10.1%). Global TFP level projected
    for 2020 with ACC would have been reached in 2013 without ACC. ACC represents
    a loss of the past 7 years of productivity growth (between 2007 and 2016).'
  5: Ignoring input responses indicates ACC would have reduced output by about 27.6%
    with a 90% confidence interval between -48.3% and -14.3%, noticeably higher than
    the 20.8% reduction based on TFP.
  6: ACC is increasingly reducing agricultural output, with a detectable and sizeable
    impact as of 2020. Impact estimates are given at the global, regional, and country
    level in Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b, reflecting climate uncertainty (from GCMs), econometric
    uncertainty (from the estimation) and specification uncertainty (from the choice
    of the econometric model). The colored bands in Fig. 5a represent 95%, 90% and
    80% confidence intervals (CIs).
  8: The paper models the percentage change in TFP as a function of temperature and
    precipitation changes, controlling for country and year fixed effects. They find
    a 76% increase in global TFP from 1961-2015 using their approach, compared to
    a 71% rise indicated by the USDA.
  9: The paper computes the cumulative impact of ACC on agricultural TFP growth from
    1962 to 2020, expressed as the difference between TFP growth with and without
    ACC. It presents 2,000 trajectories of cumulative ACC impact and the distribution
