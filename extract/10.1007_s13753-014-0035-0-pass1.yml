Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global climate change, population growth, economic development, large cyclonic
    storm surges.
  2: Tropical cyclones and storm surges, relative sea-level rise caused by storm surges
    (hazard intensity).
  3: Storm surges triggered by tropical cyclones.
  6: Storm surges triggered by tropical cyclones. Maximum relative water level rise
    in global coastal zones.
  7: Storm surges associated with extreme precipitation and strong winds.
  8: Storm surge intensity, affected areas, terrain, landforms, disaster prevention
    facilities, and disaster prevention and reduction measures are drivers of risk.
Highlights:
  1: Preliminary outlook on risks that may help governments of countries to make storm
    surge disaster prevention and reduction plans.
  2: Develops a method to assess the potential storm surge impact on populations and
    economies more systematically on the global scale.
  3: Potential storm surge impact is defined as the possible losses caused by a storm
    surge.
  6: The paper focuses on storm surge impacts on global population and economy. The
    research produces a country ranking of risk according to the sum of inundated
    areas, affected population, and GDP loss.
  7: Study examined the potential global impact of storm surges on populations and
    economies.
  8: The study identifies countries most at risk in terms of inundated area, affected
    population, and affected GDP due to storm surges, and compares results with historical
    data.
Methodology:
  1: The potential inundated area of global coastal zones is projected using information
    diffusion theory, based on historical hourly sea-level observation records from
    the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center (UHSLC), considering variations in coastal
    morphology and tropical cyclone tracks. Results applicable in the context of storm
    surge disaster prevention and reduction plans.
  2: Uses historical water-level records and information diffusion theory to analyze
    storm surge intensity; simulates storm surge intensity considering coastline types
    and cyclone tracks; employs population density and GDP data; interpolates tidal
    station estimations through inverse distance weighted interpolation; uses GIS
    tools to create potential affected population and GDP maps.
  3: Fuzzy information processing is used to estimate the maximum relative sea level.
    Assumes storm surge is a stochastic Markov chain process. GIS is used to estimate
    the areas inundated by storm surges.
  6: The paper uses historical storm surge disaster records from the Global Risk Data
    Platform (GRDP). Country rankings according to the statistics derived from the
    GRDP data were compared with country rankings from this study to test the reliability
    of the results in the estimated inundated area and affected population. The GRDP
    data includes a compilation of storm surges triggered by tropical cyclones from
    1975 to 2007.
  7: Uses available and recent global datasets to examine the potential global impact
    of storm surges on populations and economies.
  8: The study simulated the potential annual maximum inundated area based on the
    yearly expected value of maximum relative water level rise, and then calculated
    the population and GDP potentially affected annually by storm surges without taking
    protective measures.
More Notes:
  2: The study compiles a global database with observations and statistical data to
    assess potential storm surge impacts, and focuses on the effect caused by extreme
    high water levels.
  3: Data sources include IIASA, FAO, Utrecht University, University of Hawaii Sea
    Level Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), NOAA, and Global Risk Data
    Platform (GRDP).
  6: The paper validates its results by comparing them with data from the Global Risk
    Data Platform (GRDP).
  7: The sample size for potential population and GDP impacts is 57, and the top 10%
    countries are listed in Table 2 (not provided).
  8: The study acknowledges limitations due to the absence of a global database on
    shoreline protection and the lack of incorporation of man-made and natural coastal
    protective features.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Population and GDP at risk of storm surge impacts are calculated and mapped.
  2: Potential impacts on populations and economies at the global scale due to storm
    surges.
  3: Potential affected population and GDP due to storm surges.
  6: "Country level statistics of potential inundated area, potentially affected population,\
    \ and potentially affected GDP are generated. High economic losses are mainly\
    \ distributed in some coastal areas of England, other developed countries in Europe,\
    \ the Yangtze River Delta in China, the eastern coast of the United States, and\
    \ the Gulf of Mexico. For the Bay of Bengal, the economic risk is not as remarkable\
    \ because of the area\u2019s underdeveloped economies."
  7: Potential GDP impacts due to storm surges.
  8: Affected GDP due to storm surges is an outcome of interest.
Quantitative material:
  1: Population and GDP at risk of storm surge impacts are calculated and mapped;
    Validation via comparison with historical losses.
  2: Global database of environmental, hazard, and exposure data, historical disaster
    records, global hourly research quality sea level station observations.
  3: Global population density data and GDP distribution data with a resolution of
    1 km x 1 km are used. Historical tropical cyclone tracks from 1856-2006 and tropical
    cyclone surge events from 1975-2007 are considered.
  6: Number of stations with different maximum relative water level rise (depicted
    in a graph). Relative water level rise is shown with yellow dots representing
    between 1 and 2 meters, orange dots indicating a rise between 2 and 3 meters,
    red dots representing between 3 and 4 meters, and green dots representing less
    than 1 meter. Risk of 57 countries according to the sum of inundated areas, affected
    population, and GDP loss.
  7: Significant correlation found at the 0.01 confidence level (bilateral) between
    inundated area and country ranking, with correlation coefficient of 0.72. Correlation
    coefficients of 0.47 and 0.57 for population and GDP impacts respectively at the
    0.01 confidence level (bilateral).

    area, potential affected population, and potential affected GDP due to storm surges.
