Drivers of Risk:
  1: Weather shocks, climate change
  2: Weather shocks, such as heat waves and droughts, are identified as sources of
    economic fluctuations.
  3: Weather shocks; rise in the variability of weather events; unsatisfactory levels
    of soil moisture; time-varying productivity of agricultural land
  4: Weather shocks drive an important fraction of the unconditional variance of GDP,
    consumption, and agricultural output.
  5: Increase in the variance of climate variables.
  6: "Weather shocks measured through soil moisture deficits, temperature shocks,\
    \ rainfall variations, El Ni\xF1o events."
  7: Changes in soil moisture deficits due to cyclical weather patterns, including
    periods of drought.
  8: Severe weather shocks (specifically droughts)
  9: Adverse weather shock, specifically drought (measured as soil moisture deficits).
  10: Unexpected weather conditions such as drought affecting agricultural productivity.
  11: "Variations in soil moisture, captured by the weather variable \u03B5Wt, which\
    \ affects agricultural production."
  12: "Weather shocks (\u03B5Wt), economy-wide technology shock (\u03B5Zt)"
  13: 'Weather hysteresis effects: prolonged severe droughts entail early liquidation
    of stocks combined with a drop in the fertility rate, having permanent effects
    on agricultural production.'
  14: Drought shocks.
  16: "Weather shock (drought shock), labor supply AR(1) shock (\u03B5Ht)"
  19: Technological shocks and public spending shocks characterized by AR(1) processes
    impact macroeconomic outcomes.
  22: "Shocks {St}\u221Et=0"
  23: Drought index (soil moisture).
  24: "Drought index (\u02C6          \u03C9tis) and foreign production gap (\u02C6\
    \       y\u2217tis) are included as drivers."
  25: "The key driver of risk is the damage function parameter \u03B8, which represents\
    \ the impact of temperature increases on output. The paper acknowledges the potential\
    \ for controversy surrounding the choice of functional form and parameter values\
    \ for this damage function, referencing Pindyck (2017)."
  27: Weather shocks (average and extreme droughts).
  28: Weather shocks are considered as drivers influencing business cycles.
  29: Drought events (weather shocks).
  30: Weather shocks (specifically droughts)
  31: Supply shocks (technology, labor supply, sectoral reallocation); Demand shocks
    (government spending, household preferences, investment); Foreign shocks (consumption
    and foreign preferences); Weather shocks.
  32: Weather shocks, specifically droughts and periods of good soil moisture affecting
    agricultural production.
  33: Weather shock (drought)
  34: The decay rate of land productivity affects economic responses and hysteresis
    effects following a drought shock.
  35: Changes in the variance of weather shocks (drought events) due to climate change.

    changes in the volatility of weather shocks under different Representative Concentration
    Pathways (RCPs).

  47: Weather shock; CO2 emissions projections; projected precipitation.
  48: Weather (presumably variations thereof) is included as a driver.
Highlights:
  1: Weather shocks significantly impact GDP and agricultural output in New Zealand.
    Climate change increases the macroeconomic volatility and the welfare cost associated
    with weather shocks.
  2: A quantitative framework is proposed to analyze the short-term effects of weather
    shocks on business cycles, highlighting their growing importance, especially for
    agricultural-based economies.
  3: Adverse weather shocks cause a large and persistent contraction of agricultural
    production, accompanied by a decline in consumption, investment and a rise in
    hours worked; weather shocks cause current account deficits and a depreciation
    of the domestic currency.
  4: Climate change critically increases the variability of key macroeconomic variables
    such as GDP, agricultural output, or the real exchange rate.
  5: The implications from a rise in the variability of climate is non-trivial and
    should be more considered in the literature of climate change.
  6: Weather shocks, measured by soil moisture deficits, are important for macroeconomic
    outcomes; temperature shocks can significantly reduce productivity growth; the
    study takes a theoretical model to the data, rather than relying solely on calibration.
  7: Severe droughts have disrupted New Zealand's economy in 2007, 2010, 2013, and
    2015, affecting the agricultural sector.
  8: Droughts lead to a temporary decline in the share of the agricultural sector
    in total output. Tertiary sector tends to experience a relative expansion after
    drought shocks.
  9: A drought shock leads to a contraction of New Zealand's economy, with agricultural
    production declining by 0.12% contemporaneously and 1.27% after three periods,
    and GDP declining by 0.05% simultaneously.
  10: Weather shocks have a very persistent effect on the economy, particularly labor
    market dynamics.
  11: "The model introduces a weather variable (\u03B5Wt) to represent variations\
    \ in soil moisture, which influences agricultural production and generates aggregate\
    \ fluctuations."
  14: Droughts can cause critical losses in crop yield due to temporal gaps between
    the drought and harvest. Land productivity exhibits persistence due to the interaction
    between rainfall and evapotranspiration. Farmers can optimally offset soil dryness
    by increasing field irrigation.
  16: A linear or convex cost function for land maintenance is preferred because it
    can feature an increase in spending following an adverse weather shock; Decreasing
    land maintenance expenditures when land productivity is already low further deteriorates
    land productivity to reach zero; Imperfect substitutability of labor supply between
    sectors can explain co-movements at the sector level.
  27: Weather shocks, particularly extreme droughts, can significantly reduce land
    productivity and agricultural production. The model overstates the volatility
    of total output and consumption.
  28: The study evaluates the effect of weather-driven business cycles by comparing
    model probabilities and data densities with a prior probability of 50% for both
    models.
  29: Weather shocks matter in explaining the business cycles of New Zealand. A drought
    shock strongly affects business cycles through a large decline in agricultural
    output. Weather shocks act as a standard (sectoral) negative supply shock through
    a combination of rising hours worked and falling output.
  31: Weather shocks cause important macroeconomic fluctuations, especially in agricultural
    production and with increasing impact over time; Foreign shocks are a significant
    driver of GDP fluctuations, particularly in the short run.
  32: Weather shocks, particularly droughts, have a significant impact on agricultural
    production, and these impacts spill over to the wider economy, affecting GDP,
    consumption, and labor markets. The model shows that weather shocks can account
    for significant fluctuations in these macroeconomic variables.
  33: "The parameter \u03C6, shaping the land cost function, significantly affects\
    \ the propagation mechanism of a weather shock. Lower returns to scale (lower\
    \ \u03C6) in the land cost function lead to a stronger recession in the agricultural\
    \ sector due to a positive spike in its relative price. Parameter \u03B9 which\
    \ defines labour mobility across sectors also changes the Impulse Response Functions\
    \ following a shock."
  34: Higher decay rates of land productivity reduce persistence of macroeconomic
    fluctuations but increase steady state land productivity expenditures.
  35: Climate change induces important changes in the volatility of key macroeconomic
    variables, with significant increases in volatility under pessimistic climate
    scenarios, particularly affecting agricultural production and consumption.
  36: Climate change, modeled through increased weather shock volatility, generally
    increases the variance of macroeconomic variables. The welfare cost of weather
    shocks is estimated, with higher RCPs leading to greater welfare costs.
  37: Demonstrates non-trivial welfare costs of weather shocks; worst-case scenario
    welfare cost increase to 0.46% of permanent consumption.
  38: Weather shocks matter in explaining business cycles of New Zealand. Weather
    shocks generate a recession through contraction of agricultural production and
    investment, combined with a rise in hours worked. Rise in variability of weather
    events leads to an increase in the variability of key macroeconomic variables.
    There are important welfare costs incurred by weather-driven business cycles.
  44: The paper models the system response to a weather shock using DSGE and SVAR
    models, showing impulse response functions and comparing model-generated steady
    state ratios with empirical ratios.
  45: The red line in Figure 8 depicts the contribution of the weather shock to the
    corresponding deviation of observable variables. Shaded area in Figure 8 indicates
    severe drought episodes.
  47: The paper models the impact of weather shocks on macroeconomic variables and
    quantifies the increasing uncertainty of weather shocks under different climate
    scenarios.
  48: The table compares the model's ability to replicate key business cycle statistics
    (standard deviation, autocorrelation, and correlation with output) observed in
    the data.
Methodology:
  1: Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) model on New Zealand data, general equilibrium model
    with a weather-dependent agricultural sector.
  2: The paper aims to reconcile theoretical models of weather impacts with empirical
    data, focusing on short-term economic fluctuations due to weather shocks using
    weather as an observable variable.
  3: 'A two-step strategy is used: 1) A Structural Vector Auto-Regressive (SVAR) model
    is used to document the transmission mechanisms of weather shocks, using a weather
    index based on soil moisture. 2) A Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE)
    model is enriched with a weather-dependent agricultural sector and estimated through
    Bayesian techniques.'
  4: Weather-driven business cycles included in the model, with a counterfactual analysis
    on climate change using IPCC's climate change projections for 2100.
  5: Develops a model and estimates its structural parameters using data, unlike IAMs
    which rely on calibration.
  6: DSGE model estimation; theoretical model analysis, incorporating weather shocks;
    empirical analysis using soil moisture deficits as a weather measure; analysis
    of business cycle evidence on weather shocks; considers different climate scenarios;
    focuses on New Zealand.
  7: The analysis uses a macroeconomic index based on soil moisture deficits to measure
    land productivity.
  8: Analysis of sectoral share evolution before and after droughts, normalized to
    100 at the time of the drought. Pearson test for correlations between weather
    index and sectoral GDP shares.
  9: Structural Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model with restrictions to represent New
    Zealand's small open economy and exogenous weather. One lag is used, and a lower
    triangular Choleski decomposition is used to derive orthogonal impulse responses.
  10: Using SVAR impulse response and Monte-Carlo simulations to model the effects
    of weather shocks.
  11: A theoretical model with a stochastic AR(1) process for weather shocks impacting
    the agricultural sector. The model includes entrepreneurs operating in both agricultural
    and non-agricultural sectors, with a fraction nt operating in agriculture.
  12: Uses a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with a Cobb-Douglas
    production function for the agricultural sector. Treats weather as an exogenous
    process.
  13: The model is solved up to a first approximation to the policy function to avoid
    criticisms of IAMs regarding functional form choices and parameter values.
  14: Develops a model relaxing the assumption of fixed land in agricultural economics
    by introducing time-varying land productivity affected by drought and farmer expenditures
    on inputs like pesticides and irrigation. The model includes an endogenous law
    of motion for land productivity (Equation 4). The model assumes the marginal product
    of land is increasing in the accumulation of land productivity.
  16: Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with two production sectors
    (agricultural and non-agricultural), representative household, imperfect substitutability
    of labor supply
  19: Analysis involves modeling technology as an AR(1) shock, affecting both agricultural
    and non-agricultural sectors, with a focus on the law of motion of physical capital
    in non-agricultural sectors.
  22: Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model, Bayesian estimation, linear
    approximation of policy function, Kalman filter. Model is estimated using quarterly
    data for New Zealand.
  23: Bayesian estimation relying on a VAR model; variables are transformed to achieve
    stationarity (detrending, log transformation, population adjustments). The model
    neglects trends due to the short sample period.
  24: The paper uses a calibrated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model
    for New Zealand, estimated using Bayesian methods.
  25: "The paper uses prior distributions for various parameters in a macroeconomic\
    \ model, drawing from Smets and Wouters (2007) and adapting them for an agricultural\
    \ sector and climate change damage. The priors are specified for parameters like\
    \ persistence of AR(1) processes, labor disutility curvature, consumption habits,\
    \ investment adjustment cost, substitution parameters (\xB5, \xB5N, \xB5A), risk\
    \ aversion (\u03C3C), labor sectoral cost (\u03B9), land efficiency decay rate\
    \ (\u03B4\u2113), land share in production (\u03C9), and land cost parameter (\u03C6\
    ), and the damage function parameter (\u03B8)."
  26: The paper estimates a model for New Zealand using the dynare package, employing
    the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to calculate the posterior distribution and
    evaluate the marginal likelihood. They use a generated sample of 800,000 (discarding
    the first 80,000) and assess convergence with multivariate convergence statistics.
  27: The analysis is based on a model with estimated parameters. The damage function
    maps weather index changes to agricultural production cycles. Results depend on
    model assumptions, including Gaussian shocks and neglecting farmer reactions.
  28: The analysis compares two models, with and without the impact of weather shocks,
    using Bayesian model comparison and Laplace-approximated marginal data densities
    to evaluate their fit.
  29: Compares a DSGE model (Weather-Driven Business Cycles) with a model that excludes
    weather damage (No Weather Damage Model) using Bayesian methods and posterior
    odds ratios. Also compares with an SVAR model.
  30: DSGE model used to predict the impact of drought compared to an SVAR model.
  31: "Variance decomposition of macroeconomic variables into contributions from different\
    \ types of shocks (supply, demand, foreign, and weather) at various time horizons\
    \ (Q2, Q10, Q50, Q\u221E)."
  32: Estimation of a model, simulation of the model's response to weather shocks,
    historical decomposition of business cycles.
  33: The analysis uses a model with a weather-dependent agricultural sector and examines
    impulse response functions (IRFs) to a weather shock under different parameter
    calibrations. The IRFs are expressed in percentage deviations from the steady
    state. Focus is on the short-run and long-run impacts.
  34: The paper uses a model that contrasts different calibrations of decay rates
    of land productivity and assesses variance in weather shocks under different climate
    scenarios.
  35: "Estimated DSGE model is used to simulate the effects of altered weather shock\
    \ variability on macroeconomic variables, comparing historical weather conditions\
    \ (1989\u20132014) to future climate scenarios (2015\u20132100) with normalized\
    \ historical values."
  36: A macroeconomic model is simulated, and theoretical variances of variables are
    estimated. Weather shock variances are then modified to reflect different climate
    scenarios. New simulations are estimated using the modified variances, and the
    theoretical variances of variables are compared to the reference period (1994-2016).
    Welfare costs are computed by determining the fraction of consumption households
    would be willing to give up to live in an economy free of weather shocks, using
    a second-order approximation to the welfare index.
  37: Analysis performed using a model that considers welfare costs of business cycles
    in presence of weather shocks, with CRRA utility specification and climate change
    approximated by increasing variance of weather shocks.
  38: DSGE model for New Zealand, SVAR model. Analysis of climate change by increasing
    the variance of weather shocks consistent with projections in 2100.
  44: DSGE and SVAR models are used to generate Impulse Response Functions (IRFs)
    in response to a weather shock. Empirical ratios are computed using data between
    1990 and 2017.
  45: Model-based analysis where the model is fed with all shocks versus only weather
    shocks to isolate the impact of weather shocks.
  46: The analysis utilizes impulse response functions to measure percentage deviations
    from the steady state following weather shocks, with variations in land expenditure
    cost and labor substitution across sectors.
  47: "The analysis uses impulse response functions to model the effects of weather\
    \ shocks. It estimates the standard errors of projected precipitations \u03C3\
    Wt for each representative concentration pathway, assuming a linear trend from\
    \ 2013 to 2100."
  48: The analysis compares theoretical business cycle moments from a model with their
    empirical counterparts. Applicability isn't explicitly stated, but it seems to
    be designed to model and analyze business cycles.
More Notes:
  1: The study reconciles theoretical and empirical approaches to assessing the impact
    of weather shocks. The model focuses on the role of a weather-dependent agricultural
    sector.
  3: The models use New Zealand data because of the frequency of weather shocks and
    the country's relatively small size; Weather is treated as an exogenous process.
  5: This paper analyzes climate change from the perspective of increased variance
    in climate variables rather than focusing solely on changes in the mean.
  6: The paper aims to complement existing studies by using a theoretical model and
    expanding the weather measure beyond temperature to include rainfall. The paper
    studies the short-term effects of weather shocks, and also welfare costs under
    different climate scenarios.
  9: The model assumes that human activities do not significantly affect the occurrence
    of droughts due to the limited historical data. The foreign block contains a GDP
    measure for New Zealand's top trading partners.
  11: The model assumes that the aggregate drought index follows an autoregressive
    process with only one lag.
  12: The model does not consider news shocks about the weather, assuming farmers'
    forecast horizon lies between 1 and 15 days. The model assumes no CO2 feedback
    loop.
  13: "Setting \u03B8=0 shuts down the propagation of weather-driven business cycles\
    \ in the model."
  14: "The model incorporates hysteresis effects in both animal stock production and\
    \ crop production. The functional form of land costs is assumed to be v(xit) =\
    \ \u03C4x\u03C6it, allowing for constant or increasing returns to land costs."
  16: The model incorporates external consumption habits, consumption aversion, and
    labor disutility.
  23: The drought index is a weighted average of soil moisture indices at the state
    level, with weights based on the relative size of agricultural output in each
    state.
  26: "The paper uses methods developed by Iskrev (2010) to assess the identi\uFB01\
    cation of parameters and finds that su\uFB03cient and necessary conditions for\
    \ local identi\uFB01cation are ful\uFB01lled by their estimated model."
  27: "The parameter \u03B8 is noted as potentially critically high. The model tries\
    \ to replicate observed means and volatility, with varying degrees of success."
  29: The DSGE model provides micro-founded mechanisms that drive the propagation
    of a weather shock.
  31: The model captures the key role of foreign shocks as a driver of economic fluctuations,
    unlike some other models; The increasing contribution of weather shocks over time
    suggests a persistence mechanism associated with weather hysteresis effects.
  32: The study focuses on New Zealand's macroeconomic experience. The model suggests
    a spillover mechanism from the agricultural sector to the rest of the economy.
  33: "The model's originality is in the weather-dependent agricultural sector. The\
    \ paper investigates the sensitivity of the model's results to three key parameters:\
    \ land expenditure cost (\u03C6), labor sectoral cost (\u03B9), and land efficiency\
    \ decay rate (\u03B4\u2113) (though \u03B4\u2113 is not investigated on the provided\
    \ page)."
  35: The paper analyzes the effects of both a decrease (optimistic scenario) and
    increase (pessimistic scenarios) in weather shock variance.
  36: The model may underestimate the impact of climate change on developing economies
    due to the model's current structure and the likely greater importance of the
    agricultural sector within those economies.
  38: The framework could be employed to evaluate the optimal conduct of monetary
    policy to mitigate the destabilizing effects of weather shocks. Fiscal policy
    could also play a role, for instance by providing disaster payments.
  44: IRFs are reported in percentage deviations from the deterministic steady state.
    The presented results appear to pertain to a single (unspecified) country.
  48: The paper seems to be evaluating a macroeconomic model based on its ability
    to match observed economic behavior. The inclusion of agricultural output and
    weather suggests a potential link to climate impacts, though this isn't explicitly
    stated on the page.

Quantitative material:
  1: Weather shocks explain about 35% of GDP and agricultural output fluctuations
    in New Zealand. Welfare cost of weather shocks is 0.30% of permanent consumption.
    Welfare cost increases to 0.46% in the worst-case climate change scenario.
  3: The paper quantifies climate change through a rise in the variability of weather
    events; Weather shocks play a non-trivial role in driving the business cycles
    in New Zealand.
  4: Welfare cost of weather-driven business cycles peaks up to 0.46% in the worst-case
    climate change scenario.
  6: A one-standard deviation temperature shock causes a 1.4 percentage point decrease

    and tertiary sector share (0.39, p-value 0.00, 95% CI [0.19,0.55]).
  9: A rise in soil moisture deficits implies a contemporaneous 0.12% contraction
    of agricultural production. The depression in agricultural production reaches
    a peak decline of 1.27% after three periods. It is simultaneously followed by
    a 0.05% contraction of GDP

    \ for standard errors of innovations (mean 1, standard deviation 2), Gamma for\
    \ \xB5, \xB5N, \xB5A (mean 2, standard deviation 1), Normal for \u03C3C (mean\
    \ 2, standard deviation 0.35), Gaussian for \u03B9 (mean 1, standard deviation\
    \ 0.75), Beta for \u03B4\u2113 (mean 0.2, standard deviation 0.07), Beta for \u03C9\
    \ (mean 0.2, standard deviation 0.12), and Gaussian for \u03C6 (mean 1, standard\
    \ deviation 1)."
  26: The prior distribution of a key damage function parameter is a uniform distribution
    with zero mean and standard deviation 500.
  27: Average damage to land productivity is below 0.0008%. An average weather shock
    (0.81) slashes land productivity by 15%. An extreme drought (1.5) cuts land productivity
    by 26%. Extreme drought reduces agricultural production by 3.6%.
  29: Drought decreases land productivity by 22%.
  30: "Figure 7 reports the forecast error variance decomposition for four observable\
    \ variables, i.e., aggregate real production (gdpt), real agricultural production\
    \ (YAt), real consumption (Ct) and hours worked (Ht). Five di\uFB00erent time\
    \ horizons are considered, ranging from two quarters"
  31: "Foreign shocks account for 18.4% of New Zealand\u2019s GDP in the short run,\
    \ and 8.1% in the long run; Weather shocks contribute 3.7% to GDP variance at\
    \ a two-quarter horizon, increasing to 35% for the unconditional variance; Supply\
    \ shocks account for 89% of the variance of agricultural production at a two-quarter\
    \ horizon, declining to 57% for the unconditional variance."
  32: Weather shocks can contribute between +4% and -6% to agricultural production
    fluctuations. For GDP and consumption, the weather's contribution oscillates between
    +2% to -2%. Weather-driven changes in aggregate labor demand oscillate between
    -0.5% to 0.9%. The 2008 and 2016 droughts entailed a joint 1% contraction in GDP
    and consumption, while labor supplied increased by 1%. One fourth of agricultural
    slowdown following the 2008 drought is accounted for by weather shock. In 2016,
    a prolonged episode of drought also contributed by 5% to the contraction of the
    agricultural supply.
  33: "The paper contrasts IRFs under different parameter values for \u03C6 (1.57,\
    \ 2.57, 3.57) and \u03B9 (0, 2.9, 5)."
  35: Under RCP 4.5, total output variance rises by 5.22%. Under RCP 8.5, total output
    variance rises by 19.19%, agricultural production volatility increases by 21.88%,
    consumption variance increases by 27.09%, relative price of agricultural goods
    increases by 16.8%, net foreign asset increases by 31.86%, current account variance
    rises by 11.45%, and real exchange rate variance rises by 7.54%.
  36: "Table 3 provides quantitative estimates of the percentage change in the variance\
    \ of macroeconomic variables (GDP, consumption, etc.) and welfare measures under\
    \ different climate change scenarios (RCP 2.5, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) compared to\
    \ a historical baseline (1994-2016). It also provides quantitative estimates of\
    \ the welfare cost (\u03BB) in percentage terms and welfare in monetary terms\
    \ under different climate scenarios."
  37: 'Welfare costs: 0.3% for droughts, 0.08% for productivity shocks, 0.05% for
    spending shocks, 0.06% for investment shocks, 0.75% for labor supply shocks, 0.12%
    for sector reallocation shock, 0.003% for foreign consumption shock, 0.06% for
    foreign discount factor.'
  38: Households are willing to pay 0.30% of their unconditional consumption to live
    in a world with no weather shocks.
  44: 'C/Y ratio: 0.55 (model), 0.57 (data); I/Y ratio: 0.23 (model), 0.22 (data);
    Real interest rate: 4.72 (model), 4.75 (data); Goods market openness: 0.28 (model),
    0.29 (data); Agricultural production to GDP ratio: 0.08 (model), 0.07 (data).'

    of weather shock to deviations in observable variables; Identification of the
    10th percentile of severe drought episodes.
  47: Figure 11 shows impulse response functions (IRFs) in percentage deviations from
    steady state following a weather shock for various decay rates of land efficiency.
    Figure 12 shows estimations of the increase of the standard error of the weather
    shock under four different climate scenarios.
  48: Standard deviation, autocorrelation, and correlation with total output are quantified
    for each outcome variable in both the model and empirical data, with 95% confidence
    intervals for the data.
