Drivers of Risk:
  2: Aging populations and natural disasters impact savings rates.
  3: Climate change problems; Extreme weather events (flooding, hurricanes, earthquakes);
    Slow global progress in reducing CO2 emissions; Demographic changes (aging, declining
    fertility rates).
  4: Changes in population dependency ratios (child and old-age)
  5: Demographic change towards an aging society, climate-related risks (both physical
    and transitory)
  9: "Demographic changes: changes in savings rate (s), growth rate of knowledge (a),\
    \ tax rate (t), population growth rate (n), depreciation rate of capital (\u03B4\
    ), and old-age dependency ratio (\u03C6)."
  10: Climate risks such as natural disasters and extreme weather events lead to more
    disaster days, increased physical capital destruction, and higher depreciation
    rates.
  11: The number of days relating to all kinds of natural disasters are accumulated
    as a proxy for the potential impact of natural disasters.
  14: Potentially natural disasters (al disast), climate change related things, Old-age
    dependency ratio (TDROld-ag)
  15: Old-age dependency ratio, number of disaster days
  16: Aging of the population.
Highlights:
  2: Aging populations and natural disasters negatively impact savings rates in OECD
    countries.
  3: Natural disasters lead to lower savings ratios; Successful climate policy (lower
    frequencies of natural disasters) will raise the global (OECD) savings ratio;
    Longer spells of serious disasters bring about lower savings ratios because people
    are discouraged from accumulating physical assets or face negative income shocks.
  4: OECD countries are clustered in quadrants with either a high/low ratio of old-age
    dependency and a low child dependency. Japan has a high old-age dependency ratio
    and a low child dependency ratio. Mexico and Israel have a high child dependency
    ratio and a low old-age dependency ratio. The old-age dependency ratio is expected
    to double within the next half-century.
  5: Uncertainties arising from demographic change and climate-related risks could
    have a significant impact on savings behavior.
  9: "Demographic change leads to a flattening of the growth path. Level of the growth\
    \ path is affected by changes in s, a, t, n, \u03B4, and \u03C6. Trend growth\
    \ is positively affected by growth rate of knowledge (a) and negatively affected\
    \ by growth rate of old-age dependency ratio (\u03C6)."
  10: Climate change-related risks can cause a lower savings ratio and a higher depreciation
    rate, which would decrease the growth path level in a standard neoclassical growth
    model.
  11: No relevant information
  14: Significant negative coefficients are observed for several variables (-0.012***,
    -92.470***, -0.017***, etc.), potentially indicating adverse impacts on the outcome
    of interest. The specific impacts depend on the variables the coefficients relate
    to which we cannot determine.
  15: Climate change (measured via disaster days) and aging society (measured via
    old-age dependency ratio) have a significant impact on savings behavior in OECD
    countries. There is a negative relationship between disaster days and savings
    rate. The effect of old-age dependency ratio on savings rate changes sign over
    time.
  16: Successful climate policy will raise the global (OECD) savings ratio and thus
    could affect the cost of capital and the cost of global modernization necessary
    for achieving sustainability and climate neutrality.
Methodology:
  2: Enhanced growth model with a panel analysis approach using data from OECD countries
    between 1980 and 2020.
  3: Empirical analysis of the impact of natural disasters and demographic changes
    on savings ratios.
  4: Analysis of OECD population dependency ratios and United Nations' projections
    (medium-fertility variant) until 2080.
  9: Uses an extended Solow model to analyze the impact of demographic change on economic
    growth. Applicable for analyzing long-term trends.
  10: A panel data analysis with fixed-effects is performed using an enhanced growth
    equation.
  14: Panel data regression (ft-FE), long-term analysis. Various sub-samples (e.g.,
    2007-2020, EU) are used in the analysis. Driscoll-Kraay standard errors.
  15: Empirical analysis using data from OECD countries from 1980 to 2020.
More Notes:
  4: The size of bubbles in Fig. 1 refers to GDP per capita of each country in 2019
    in USD at 2015 constant prices at Purchasing Power Parity (PPP).
  9: Assumes interdependencies between savings rate, per-capita income, and old-age
    dependency ratio. Notes the potential for economic policy countermeasures (e.g.,
    life-long learning) to mitigate the negative impacts of aging on the growth rate
    of knowledge.
  11: The paper uses the number of days of natural disasters instead of the total
    damages due to fewer missing observations.
  14: The excerpt is difficult to interpret without context. It appears to be a results
    table from panel data regressions, with different specifications or sub-samples.
    The dependent variable(s) are not explicitly stated, and the meanings of the independent
    variables are abbreviated. The term 'NYDr' could be a country.
  15: "The analysis suggests that after natural disasters, households\u2019 increasing\
    \ awareness of the risk of physical destruction could lead to a lower savings\
    \ rate. Also, dissaving could be the result of induced self-insurance following\
    \ disasters."
  16: Innovation promotion, especially green innovation, is needed through enhanced
    real and economic openness, more incentives for inward foreign direct investments,
    higher R&D subventions, and more spending on education.

  15: "Shows a highly significant negative link between the old-age dependency ratio\
    \ and the savings rate for the overall sample from 1980 to 2020. For the period\
    \ 2007\u20132020, the coefficient reverses its sign and indicates a positive relationship\
    \ between the old-age dependency ratio and the savings rate. Results also indicate\
    \ a negative link between the number of disaster days and the savings rate for\
    \ OECD countries."
