Drivers of Risk:
  3: Weather-related extreme events (floods and landslides) in Brazil.
  4: Heat-related mortality, heat-related labour capacity reduction, air pollution,
    fossil fuel subsidies, climate finance dependence on political cycles.
  6: "Climate change (warming, extreme weather events, wild\uFB01res, \uFB02oods,\
    \ droughts); El Ni\xF1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO); Persistent burning of fossil\
    \ fuels; Air pollution; Tree cover loss; Emissions from agricultural production\
    \ and consumption"
  7: Increased exposure of vulnerable populations (infants and adults older than 65
    years) to heatwaves. High ambient temperatures affecting physiological responses
    leading to heat stress. Increased risk of heat stress during physical activity
    due to higher ambient temperatures.
  8: "Rising temperatures, droughts, warming climate, wild\uFB01res."
  9: Climate change influencing the transmission potential of vector- and water-borne
    diseases like dengue fever and vibriosis; increased fire danger.
  10: The drivers of risk identified are heatwaves and droughts, as well as non-climatic
    factors like poverty and COVID-19.
  11: Climate change impacts on population health and health systems; Environmental
    pollution; Unplanned urbanisation; Inadequate climate preparedness
  16: Dependence on international markets and foreign policies; air pollution; exposure
    to household air pollution; greenhouse gas emissions.
  19: Commodity-driven deforestation and urbanization are the main causes of tree
    cover loss in Latin America, accounting for around 80% of total loss.
  20: Tree cover loss from commodity-driven deforestation and shifting agriculture
    in Latin America.
  21: Dietary risk factors (low consumption of nutritious plant-based food and high
    consumption of animal-based and processed food) and reliance on fossil fuels and
    other polluting sources of energy (e.g., biomass) are the main drivers of risk
    discussed on this page.
  22: Climate change-induced extreme weather events (droughts, floods, wildfires,
    hurricanes); droughts reducing hydropower generation; external stressors (e.g.,
    wars and international conflicts) incentivizing the use of fossil fuels; excessive
    consumption of animal-based and processed foods; deforestation for pasture.
  23: Weather-related extreme events exacerbated by climate change (floods, landslides,
    heatwaves), heat exposure, and air pollution.
  24: Heat-related labour capacity reduction, exposure to anthropogenic ambient PM2.5
    air pollution, climate change, fossil fuel subsidies.
  25: Weather-related extreme events; heat-related mortality; heat-related labour
    capacity reduction
  26: Impacts of climate change on health of populations, natural ecosystems, critical
    infrastructure, and other human systems.
  28: Climate change impacts on health, including infectious diseases, diseases, and
    nutrition.
  30: Extreme heat leading to more days of heatwave exposure, heat-related mortality,
    and increased transmission potential of dengue by Aedes aegypti.
Highlights:
  3: Economic losses due to extreme weather events amounted to US$15.6 billion in
    2022 (0.28% of GDP), with floods and landslides in Brazil being major contributors.
  4: Heat-related labour capacity reduction and air pollution cause significant GDP
    losses in Latin America; Fossil fuel subsidies are prevalent and negatively impact
    health expenditure.
  6: "Latin American populations were exposed to an average increase in summer temperature\
    \ in 2022; Warming trend persists despite La Ni\xF1a effects; overlapping events\
    \ of global warming and ENSO trigger devastating consequences."
  7: Exposure of vulnerable populations to heatwaves has significantly increased in
    Latin America, with infants and older adults experiencing substantially more days
    of heatwaves compared to the 1986-2005 baseline. Heat poses greater risk during
    physical activity.
  8: "Estimated annual average number of heat-related deaths increased by 140% from\
    \ 2000\u20132009 to 2013\u20132022 period in Latin America."
  9: Dengue transmission potential has increased significantly in Latin America due
    to climate change. The coastline suitable for Vibrio spp. bacteria has also increased.
  10: Increased heatwaves and droughts are associated with a significant increase
    in food insecurity in Latin America.
  11: There is a need for enhanced local-level evidence to provide clarity and specificity
    in the planning and implementing of adaptation measures to reduce vulnerability;
    Persistent need for strengthening the measurement of the policy impacts on society
    as well as basal funding schemes for the adaptation measures; Climate risk and
    vulnerability assessments, especially at the municipal level, can serve as a solid
    foundation for making informed decisions, adapting to the adverse effects of climate
    change locally, building more resilient communities, and improving the quality
    of life more broadly
  16: Renewable energy sources have emerged as pivotal contributors to electricity
    generation in all Latin American countries.
  19: Transitioning from polluting fuels to cleaner alternatives for heating and cooking
    in Latin America reduces exposure to harmful pollutants and mortality rate significantly.
  20: Tree cover loss is significantly driven by commodity-driven deforestation and
    shifting agriculture.
  21: Imbalanced diets contribute significantly to mortality in Latin America, with
    specific dietary patterns (high animal-based and processed food consumption, low
    plant-based food consumption) posing major risks. Fossil fuel reliance contributes
    to air pollution and related health issues.
  22: Climate change impacts have profound economic impacts, including increasing
    healthcare costs, reducing labour capacity, or generating economic losses from
    damaged infrastructure and disrupted services and supply chains.
  23: Weather-related extreme events caused significant economic losses in Latin America
    in 2022. Heat-related labor capacity reduction resulted in substantial income
    losses.  Heat-related mortality and air pollution have significant economic costs.
  24: Clean energy investment in Latin America grew to US$58.3 billion in 2022, a
    6.8% increase compared to 2021, and exceeded investment in fossil fuels by 13%.
    All countries reviewed in the region had a net-negative carbon price in 2020,
    reflecting an overall fossil fuels net subsidy of US$23 billion.
  25: Latin American countries had net-negative carbon prices in 2020, with substantial
    fossil fuel subsidies. Economic losses due to weather-related extreme events were
    especially high in 2022. The rate of uninsured losses remained close to 93%.
  26: News articles on climate change and health reached a record high in 2022 in
    Latin American newspapers.
  28: Latin American governments increasingly recognise the topics of health, climate
    change, and their intersection.
  30: Significant increase in heatwave exposure and mortality, contributing to economic
    losses; Economic losses in Brazil escalated significantly due to climate-related
    disasters in 2022.
Methodology:
  6: The indicator on exposure to warming draws on the 2023 global Lancet Countdown
    report and presents the population-weighted change in temperatures, as a proxy
    for population exposure to heat.
  7: "Population-weighted change in summer mean temperatures relative to a 1986\u2013\
    2005 baseline. Risk of heat stress during physical activity is estimated based\
    \ on daily ambient temperature, relative humidity, intensity of physical activity,\
    \ and clothing worn."
  8: Draws on data from the 2023 global Lancet Countdown report
  10: The methodology combines data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) with the frequency of heatwaves days and
    drought months (SPEI-12) using a time-varying panel regression.
  11: Analysis of 38 national climate change planning documents from 12 South American
    countries; The data come from the 2022 Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Annual
    Cities Survey, which provides self-reported data for risk assessments from 268
    jurisdictions of 14 countries in Latin America; Relies on self-reported data from
    11 participating countries in the 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) Health
    and Climate Change Global Survey
  16: Draws on data from the International Energy Agency (IEA) to analyse the relationship
    between energy system transition and its implications for health outcomes; Relies
    on data from the WHO Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) database to assess
    progress regarding household energy use.
  21: The analysis draws from the 2023 global Lancet Countdown report and uses FAO
    food balance sheets to determine attributable deaths due to dietary risk factors.
  22: Analysis is based on tracking economic impacts of climate change and monitoring
    the economics of the transition to zero-carbon economies, with specific details
    provided in Section 4 of the Appendix.
  23: Uses data provided by the Swiss Re Institute for economic losses. Calculates
    potential loss of earnings from heat-related labor capacity reduction by multiplying
    labour capacity loss with average earnings per hour for each country, sector,
    and year. Estimates the monetized value of heat-related deaths of people aged
    65 and older and premature mortality due to air pollution.
  24: Draws from the 2023 global Lancet Countdown report. Monetised valuation of years
    of life lost (YYLs) due to exposure to anthropogenic ambient PM2.5 air pollution.
