Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, specifically exposure, vulnerability, and hazards at the country
    level.
  2: Climate variability and change, specifically changes in precipitation and temperature
    patterns across the African continent, and climate-related disasters.
  3: The model considers the intensity and frequency of precipitation and temperature
    extremes, as well as mean temperature and precipitation levels, as drivers of
    risk.
  4: Temperature deviation from the historical mean, Standardized Precipitation Index
    (SPI)
  5: Precipitation (Extreme & Severe dry, Moderately dry, Near normal dry, Normal
    dry, Normal wet, Near normal wet, Moderately wet, Extreme & Severe wet); Temperature
    (Linear Temp., Squared temp.)
  6: Increasing temperature deviation from historical mean; Precipitation intensity
    (severely/extremely dry to severely/extremely wet).
  7: Fluctuations in precipitation and temperature patterns; extremely wet and dry
    events.
  8: Changes in precipitation and temperature induced by future climate change.
  9: Low warming (RCP2.6) and high warming (RCP8.5) scenarios of climate change
  10: Climate variability and change serve as primary drivers impacting economic development,
    particularly in African countries.
  11: Climate variability and climate change, particularly temperature and precipitation
    extremes, exacerbated by already vulnerable economies and communities, and lack
    of efficient economic policies
Highlights:
  1: African economies are poorly adapted to current climate conditions, Western and
    Eastern African countries are projected to be the most affected, and inequalities
    between countries are projected to widen in high warming scenarios compared to
    low and without warming scenarios.
  2: "The study aims to further understand the historical vulnerability of African\
    \ economies to both precipitation (including extreme precipitation events) and\
    \ temperature fluctuations in order to estimate the extent to which countries\
    \ are adapted to their current climatic conditions. It also aims to estimate more\
    \ comprehensively the projected impact of climate change on economies at the country-level\
    \ in the perspective of African countries\u2019 economic convergence."
  3: Climate change can have negative impacts on labour productivity in all African
    regions; potential hotspots of vulnerability coincide with regions showing pre-existing
    high socioeconomic vulnerability.
  4: Climate change effects on income convergence across African countries are explored.
  5: Extreme & Severe dry precipitation has a statistically significant negative impact
    on GDP per capita in the current year, 1-year lag, 5-year lag and 10-year lag.
    Extreme & Severe wet precipitation has a statistically significant negative impact
    on GDP per capita in the current year and 1-year lag. Trade openness only appears
    to have a positive statistically significant effect with a lag of 5 to 10 years.
    Optimal temperature level is in the range of 0.3 and 0.5 degrees Celsius above
    the countries' historical mean. The sensitivity of GDP per capita to the effects
    of different segments of precipitation intensity describe a concave relationship.
  6: Increasing temperature deviation is negatively correlated with GDP per capita
    growth; GDP sensitivity to precipitation varies across African regions.
  7: Limited adaptation to current climatic conditions is already negatively affecting
    economic development and delaying African countries' path to emergence.
  8: Future changes in precipitation and temperature may adversely affect GDP per
    capita growth in every African region. High warming would have particularly severe
    consequences on African economies as the regional median macroeconomic risks are
    almost twice as high as in the low warming scenario by 2050.
  9: Climate change, particularly in the high warming scenario, is projected to slow
    the rate at which inequalities between African countries decrease, implying a
    delayed convergence. Countries with large populations dependent on agriculture
    are likely to be particularly affected.
  10: The economic impacts between low and high warming scenarios start diverging
    significantly in the 2030s, with high warming impacts being nearly double those
    of low warming by 2050.
  11: Climate change is not projected to increase inequalities or reverse income convergence
    between African countries, but it is projected to significantly slow these processes.
Methodology:
  1: Economic model embedding three dimensions of climate risks (exposure, vulnerability,
    hazards) at the country level, analyzing convergence considering climate-change
    damages.
  2: The analysis is performed at the national level for African countries, considering
    exposure, vulnerability, and hazards related to climate change. The model dynamically
    satisfies the three dimensions of disaster and climate risks. The effects of climate
    variability and change are introduced separately for each region and country between
    2015 and 2050 in a low and a high warming scenario.
  3: The paper develops an economic framework based on the 'risk triangle' concept
    (hazard, exposure, vulnerability) to measure climate-related risks, applicable
    for both historical and future time periods; it uses a non-linear regression model
    to estimate the sensitivity of GDP per capita to contiguous levels of precipitation
    intensity and temperature from 1980 to 2014.
  4: Panel regression for African countries from 1980-2014, country-level model calibration,
    projections based on bias-corrected GCM data, Two scenarios, the RCP8.5 scenario
    and the RCP2.6 scenario from 2015 to 2050.
  5: Panel regression with Newey-West heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation corrected
    (HAC) standard errors. NCEP population-weighted precipitation and temperature
    data is used.
  6: Uses boxplots and locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (loess) to represent
    the distribution and trend of GDP per capita growth sensitivity across different
    precipitation intensities and temperature deviations. Analysis performed for Africa
    countries.
  8: "Uses the SSP2 GDP per capita projections for both warming scenarios as an economic\
    \ development baseline to estimate the potential impacts of changes in precipitation\
    \ and temperature induced by future climate change on African countries\u2019\
    \ GDP per capita trajectories."
  9: Estimates GDP per capita for 2015-2050 using SSP2 as a baseline.  Measures GDP
    per capita growth risk as deviation from this baseline. Examines impacts on inequality
    between African countries.
  10: Analysis includes econometric evaluation of historical losses from climate variability
    and projections of impact divergence between low and high warming scenarios, applicable
    mainly to the period between 2030 and 2050.
  11: The analysis uses warming scenarios (RCP2.6) to project macroeconomic impacts
    on income convergence across African countries.
More Notes:
  1: The analysis raises issues on the ability of African countries to reach their
    SDGs targets and the potential increasing risk of instability, migration across
    African countries, of decreased trade and economic cooperation opportunities as
    a consequence of climate change.
  4: The analysis was conducted for 40 countries with sufficient socioeconomic and
    climate data availability.
  5: Temperature effects are integrated using a quadratic function.
  6: The study disaggregates the impacts by African region (Central, Eastern, Northern,
    Southern, and Western Africa), highlighting regional differences in climate change
    impacts.
  8: "The projected economic risks may potentially be underestimated as the lagged\
    \ consequences on GDP per capita are not accounted for. The paper also analyzes\
    \ the effect of future climate change on Africa\u2019s income convergence."
  9: The effect on income convergence is greater when population weighting is applied
    to the inequality index. Countries with resource endowments and more diverse economies
    are projected to be less affected. The distribution of losses across regions are
    consistent with changes in weighted and non-weighted income convergence as a result
    of climate change.
  10: Emphasis on African countries needing to integrate climate risks into development
    planning due to their poorly adapted current climatic state.
  11: The paper highlights the importance of integrating climate-related risks into
    development planning and the need for specific attention and funding from the
    international community to support vulnerable countries.

  9: GDP per capita growth risk, income inequality
  10: Potential economic impacts are discussed, especially in relation to the underestimation
    of the social cost of carbon (SCC) and the importance of low-carbon technologies
    in mitigating future climate change losses.
  11: Climate change is projected to significantly slow income convergence between
    African countries and reduce inequality reduction across these countries.
Quantitative material:
  1: Historical mean climate-induced losses between 10 and 15 percent of GDP per capita
    growth in Africa.
  3: The number of lost working days due to high temperature could increase by 3.4
    percentage points in Western Africa in the 2050s under a high warming scenario
    (SRES A2), from an already high 40.3 percent of lost days per year.
  4: Projections up to 2050 are realized using sensitivity coefficients inferred by
    the regression model and subsequent calibration.
  5: Regression results provided in Table 1 showing coefficients and standard errors
    for the impact of precipitation and temperature on GDP per capita (log) with different
    time lags.
  6: Figure 1 shows the growth effect (in log) of increasing temperature deviation
    from /C0 0.5 to +3 /C176C degrees above the historical mean for Africa countries.
    Figure 2 shows the sensitivity of GDP per capita growth (in log) to levels of
    precipitation intensity measured using SPI from severely & extremely dry to severely
    & extremely wet for Africa countries.
  7: "The ratio of effects of temperature and precipitation on GDP per capita is 0.52\
    \ [0.234\u20131.154], implying that precipitation has a greater in\uFB02uence\
    \ than temperature on GDP per capita in the period 1980\u20132014."
  8: Median GDP per capita risk is between 0 and 2.6 times higher in the high warming
    scenario in 2030 in Southern and Central African countries, respectively. Between
    2030 and 2050, the negative consequences in the high warming scenario are almost
    twice as high compared to the losses in the low warming scenario. Western Africa
    and Eastern Africa are projected to be the most affected regions in both warming
    scenarios with above 10 percent median reduction in GDP per capita in the high
    warming scenario by 2050. Macroeconomic risks are almost twice as high in the
    low warming scenario by 2050.
  9: GDP per capita growth risk (deviation from baseline) in 2030 for five African
    regions under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios (Table 2, with percentile values given).
    Delay in income convergence in years under different warming scenarios and inequality
    indices.
  11: Analysis shows that reducing future warming to the lowest technically and economically
    feasible level minimizes the risk of significant negative macroeconomic impacts
    of climate change and development rollback throughout the first half of the 21st
    century.
