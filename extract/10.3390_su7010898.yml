Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall, humidity, and
    sunshine
  2: Maximum temperature adversely affects yield and cropping area of all major food
    crops. Rainfall severely affects Aman rice only. Climate change will likely result
    in higher temperatures, heat waves, longer dry spells, higher drought risk, increased
    monsoon rainfall, and increased rainfall variability.
  3: Climate change, particularly temperature variations, has adverse effects on agricultural
    production in Bangladesh, affecting food security and the yield of major crops
    like rice and wheat.
  6: Changes in climatic variables (temperature, rainfall, humidity, sunshine) impacting
    crop yields and production.
  7: Climate change variables such as maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall,
    humidity, and sunshine affect crop yields in Bangladesh.
  8: Changes in rainfall, humidity, and sunshine impacting crop yields.
  10: Influence of production inputs like improved variety, management techniques,
    fertilizers, and pesticides on crop yields
  15: Climate variability and change
Highlights:
  1: "Effects of all the climate variables have had significant contributions to the\
    \ yield and cropping area of major food crops with distinct variation among them.\
    \ Maximum temperature statistically significantly affected all the food crops\u2019\
    \ yield except Aus rice. Rainfall significantly benefitted cropping area of Aus\
    \ rice, but significantly affected both yield and cropping area of Aman rice."
  2: Climate change poses a significant threat to food security in Bangladesh due
    to adverse effects on crop yields and cropping areas. Temperature increases and
    rainfall variability are key drivers of risk.
  3: Temperature variations have significant implications on crop yields in Bangladesh.
  6: Most climate variables showed noticeable significance of trend. The significance
    of the trend for maximum temperature was largest for Aman rice and smallest for
    wheat.
  7: Changes in climate parameters showed that maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall,
    and humidity had upward trends, while sunshine displayed a downward trend, affecting
    crop growing seasons.
  8: Rainfall increased with fluctuations in Aus and Aman rice seasons. No distinct
    trend in Boro rice and wheat season, but variations affect those crops. Humidity
    increased with minor deviations. Sunshine decreased for all seasons with fluctuations.
  10: Non-climatic yield trends are adjusted to measure climate impact; significance
    of yield stationarity is investigated
  14: Among the four major crops, Aman rice...was found to be more vulnerable to climate
    change effects compared to the other three major crops.
  15: Climate variability and change adversely impacted yield and cropping area of
    major food crops in Bangladesh.
Methodology:
  1: Heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent standard error (HAC) and feasible
    generalized least square (FGLS) methods
  6: Descriptive statistics are calculated for climate and crop variables from 1972-2010.
    A linear trend model is then used to observe trends in climatic variables, with
    time as the explanatory factor.
  7: "Linear trend analysis was conducted on climate parameters over the period 1972\u2013\
    2010 to understand their impact on major crop growing periods in Bangladesh."
  10: Use of Augmented Dickey-Fuller test to verify stationarity in time series and
    different methods to remove non-climatic trends
  14: The HAC and FGLS methods were applied to satisfy the objective [to] examine
    the impacts of climate change on the yield and cropping area of major food crops
    in Bangladesh.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity,
    which can have macroeconomic consequences, but this page does not quantify these
    broader economic effects.
  3: The page highlights the limited scope of current studies on Bangladesh, signaling
    a need for broader research to understand the impacts of climate change on agriculture.
  6: The study uses data from GOB (2012) and BMD (2013). The subsequent analysis in
    the paper (described but not included in the provided page) further explores the
    trends in climate variables.
  8: The paper investigates whether climatic trends and fluctuations affected crops
    yield in a later section (not provided on this page).
  10: Focus on methodology to differentiate climate impact from technological advances
    in crop yields
  14: No relevant information
  15: National level data might not depict the true scenario for the different agro-ecological
    zones of any country about climate change impacts on crops yield.
No relevant information:
  4: This page focuses on critiquing previous studies on climate change and crop yield
    in Bangladesh and outlining the study's objectives and methodology. It does not
    present any quantitative results or directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Yield and cropping area of four major food crops (Aus rice, Aman rice, Boro rice
    and wheat) in Bangladesh
  2: Food security is affected by climate change impacts on crop yields and cropping
    areas.
  6: None
  8: Crop yield in Bangladesh
  10: No relevant information
  14: No relevant information
  15: Food security
Quantitative material:
  1: "Uses national level time series data for the period of 1972\u20132010 to determine\
    \ climate-crop interrelations."
  2: "Forecasts of temperature increases: 1.0 \xB0C by 2030, 1.4 \xB0C by 2050, 2.4\
    \ \xB0C by 2100 (annual mean); 1.1 \xB0C by 2030, 1.6 \xB0C by 2050, 2.7 \xB0\
    C by 2100 (winter); 0.8 \xB0C by 2030, 1.1 \xB0C by 2050, 1.9 \xB0C by 2100 (monsoon).\
    \ 80 percent of rainfalls in Bangladesh occur during monsoon season (June-September)."
