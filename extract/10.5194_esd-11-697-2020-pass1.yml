  2: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Maintaining ambition as reflected in current NDCs up to 2100 and beyond
  2: "Current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are insufficient to limit\
    \ warming to 1.5\xB0C, leading to various climate impacts."
  4: Changes in annual mean temperature.
  5: "Temperature increase under different emission scenarios (NDC reference, BE33,\
    \ and 1.5\xB0C consistent pathway)."
  6: Current NDC ambition levels and the degree to which these are improved to reduce
    GHG emissions drive global mean temperature (GMT) increases.
  7: "Different climate scenarios, specifically a 'NDC reference scenario', a '33%\
    \ ambition increase for big emitters scenario', and a '1.5\u25E6C scenario', drive\
    \ the risk of sea-level rise, temperature increase, and GDP reductions."
  8: "Global mean temperature (GMT) increase under different climate scenarios (no\
    \ change in current NDCs, BE33 scenario resembling a 33% change in NDCs of big\
    \ emitters, and a 1.5\xB0C pathway)."
  9: Temperature extremes, sea-level rise
Highlights:
  1: Incremental improvements in reduction targets, even if achieved globally, are
    insufficient to align collective ambition with the goals of the Paris Agreement;
    a reduction in the gross domestic product (GDP) in tropical countries of around
    60% compared to a no-climate-change scenario
  2: Incremental improvements of 2030 targets are insufficient for the Paris Agreement
    goals, resulting in potentially significant climate impacts.
  4: "The paper analyzes the implications of different temperature trajectories on\
    \ economic damages, specifically focusing on the impact of current NDCs, a selected\
    \ gradual improvement scenario (BE33), and a 1.5\xB0C scenario."
  5: "The magnitude of GDP per capita reduction increases over time and varies depending\
    \ on the emission scenario, with the 1.5\xB0C pathway showing the least damage\
    \ and the current NDC baseline the most."
  6: "Incremental improvements of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are insufficient\
    \ to achieve the 1.5\xB0C limit, which would require 2030 GHG emission levels\
    \ to be about halved compared to current NDCs. More ambitious mitigation targets\
    \ for big emitters have the biggest effect on GMT."
  7: "Even a 33% increase in ambition by big emitters only reduces about half the\
    \ inferred impacts (sea-level rise, extreme temperatures, economic damages) compared\
    \ to limiting warming to 1.5\u25E6C."
  8: Economic damages, measured as the percentage difference in GDP per capita compared
    to a no-climate-change scenario, vary significantly depending on the climate scenario
    and region. The NDC scenario consistently projects the largest GDP per capita
    decrease by the end of the century, particularly for LDCs, SIDS, and South Asia.
    Latin America also experiences significant GDP declines, especially under the
    NDC scenario.
  9: "There is a need for a transformational increase in 2030 ambitions by countries\
    \ to achieve the 1.5\u25E6C limit to avoid impacts of exceeding this level of\
    \ warming. All countries need to contribute their fair share to meet the Paris\
    \ Agreement's long-term temperature goal."
Methodology:
  1: Assessment of outcomes of different scenarios of NDC updating
  4: Economic damages are calculated based on the methodology by Burke et al. (2018),
    combining historical relationships between GDP growth and temperature variability
    and projected future temperature changes. Downscaling of global mean temperature
    differences to gridded change patterns in annual mean temperature is also performed.
  5: The paper uses a model by Burke et al. (2018) to project economic damages, but
    notes that this model doesn't consider sea-level rise, extreme weather, or non-linear
    trends.
  6: The study models global greenhouse gas emissions and global mean temperature
    trajectories for various scenarios with different levels of emission reductions
    applied to big emitters or all countries.
  7: "The analysis projects climate impacts (sea-level rise, temperature increase,\
    \ and GDP reductions for LDCs) under different mitigation scenarios, comparing\
    \ a 'NDC reference scenario', a '33% ambition increase for big emitters scenario',\
    \ and a '1.5\u25E6C scenario'."
  8: "The analysis uses different GCMs to estimate the economic damages. Boxplots\
    \ show the percentage difference in GDP per capita under different temperature\
    \ pathways compared to a no-climate-change scenario. Estimates are given for mid-century\
    \ (2046\u20132065) and end-of-century (2081\u20132100)."
  9: The paper uses code underlying the economic analysis openly available on GitHub
    created by Marshall Burke.
More Notes:
  6: The study uses high CAT pledges and targets as a reference point.
  7: The analysis does not aim to derive conclusions about the global impact of individual
    proposed NDC updates but rather about the overall collective aggregate ambition
    increase that is needed in the short term to keep the door open for ambitious
    emissions reductions in the long term.
  8: The study groups countries by geographical regions (South Asia and Latin America)
    or political groupings following the UN classifications (Small Island Development
    States, SIDS, and Least Developed Countries, LDCs).
  9: The analysis considers LULUCF activities and notes potential issues related to
    their transparency and ambiguity in NDCs.

    mentioned on this page. The paper focuses on emissions scenarios and temperature
    projections, not economic impacts.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) in tropical countries
  4: Economic damages expressed in terms of GDP.

    60% compared to a no-climate-change scenario and median long-term sea-level rise
    of close to 2m in 2300
  4: "Economic damages are calculated for mid-century (2046\u20132065) and end of\
    \ century (2081\u20132100) under different warming scenarios (current NDCs, BE33,\
    \ and a 1.5\xB0C pathway)."
  5: "In 2100, GDP per capita reduction ranges between 29%-34% (1.5\xB0C pathway),\
    \ 43%-50% (BE33), and higher for the baseline pathway of current NDCs."
  6: "Projected GMT increase by 2100 relative to 1750 under various emission reduction\
    \ scenarios (5%, 10%, 25%, 33%) for big emitters and all countries, and the associated\
    \ global greenhouse gas emissions for the year 2030 for each scenario. Specifically,\
    \ the NDC reference scenario projects a 2.8\xB0C increase, which can be reduced\
    \ to 1.75\xB0C under the most optimistic modeled scenario."
  7: "Median GDP reductions for LDCs relative to a no-climate-change scenario are\
    \ projected to be -20%, -17%, and -14% in 2050 and -66%, -50%, and -34% in 2100\
    \ under the NDC reference, 33% ambition increase, and 1.5\u25E6C scenarios, respectively."
