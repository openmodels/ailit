Drivers of Risk:
  1: GHG emission levels implied by current NDCs, incremental NDC improvements.
  2: Incremental global NDC update scenarios for 2030
  3: No relevant information
  4: The drivers of risk are changes in global mean temperature (GMT), leading to
    thermal expansion, glacier mass loss, changes in ice sheets, and temperature variability.
  5: The drivers of risk are increases in global mean temperature (GMT) leading to
    changes in extreme temperatures and sea level rise.
  7: "The study uses different scenarios of mitigation ambition as drivers of risk,\
    \ specifically an NDC reference scenario, a scenario with a 33% ambition increase\
    \ for big emitters, and a 1.5\u25E6C scenario. These scenarios impact sea-level\
    \ rise, extreme temperatures, and economic damages."
  8: "Increases in hot extremes (TXx) and different global mean temperature (GMT)\
    \ increase scenarios (NDC, BE33, 1.5\xB0C pathway)."
  9: Temperature extremes and sea-level are drivers of risk considered.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Global mean temperature increase by 2100, extreme temperature impacts, long-term
    sea-level rise, and economic damages for the most vulnerable countries.
  2: Sea-level rise, extreme temperatures and economic damages
  3: No relevant information
  4: The paper evaluates climate impacts on sea-level rise, extreme hot days, and
    economic damages.
  5: The paper evaluates changes in extreme temperature (TXx, hottest day of the year)
    and economic damages (GDP per capita reduction).
  7: This study evaluates the impact of different mitigation ambition scenarios on
    global mean sea-level rise (GMSLR), annual maximum temperature (TXx) increase,
    and GDP reductions for Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
  8: Economic damages measured as percentage difference in GDP per capita under different
    temperature pathways compared to a no-climate-change scenario. Also examines changes
    in hot extremes (TXx) as land area fraction affected.
  9: Economic damages are evaluated.
Highlights:
  1: Incremental improvements in reduction targets, even if achieved globally, are
    insufficient to align collective ambition with the goals of the Paris Agreement;
    a transformational increase in 2030 ambition is required to achieve the goals
    of the Paris Agreement and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
  2: Links near-term mitigation efforts directly to climate impact projections up
    to 2100 and beyond.
  3: Incremental improvements of 2030 targets are evaluated in terms of their impact
    on global warming.
  4: The paper focuses on the implications of different 2030 NDC update scenarios
    on climate impacts. Sea-level projections are interpreted as conservative estimates
    for the longer-term sea-level response.
  5: Smaller increases in ambition (5% or 10%) have limited impact on global mean
    temperature. The impact of small emitters is limited if bigger emitters do not
    increase ambition proportionally. Comparable levels of action are required by
    all emitters to meet the Paris Agreement's temperature goals. Economic damages
    are projected to be significant, particularly in tropical regions and for LDCs
    and SIDS.
  7: "Current NDC trajectories imply substantial additional impacts, and even a 33%\
    \ increase in ambition by big emitters will only reduce about half the impacts\
    \ compared to limiting warming to 1.5\u25E6C. Differences in median sea-level\
    \ rise between a 1.5\u25E6C and NDC scenario in 2100 amount to about 20cm. The\
    \ study projects that about 40% of the land area in central Europe would experience\
    \ a TXx increase under current NDC pathways of about 4\u25E6C."
  8: Economic impacts, measured as percentage difference in GDP per capita, become
    more severe by 2100, especially under the NDC pathway across Latin America, LDCs,
    SIDS, and South Asia.
  9: "Incremental improvements of 2030 ambitions are insufficient for achieving the\
    \ 1.5\xB0C limit and avoiding the impacts of exceeding this level of warming.\
    \ A transformational increase in 2030 ambitions is needed, spearheaded by big\
    \ emitters but requiring contributions from all countries."
Methodology:
  1: "Assessment of different scenarios of NDC updating that fall short of achieving\
    \ the 1.5\u25E6C benchmark, projection of global mean temperature increase by\
    \ 2100 for different incremental NDC update scenarios."
  2: Combines a range of different approaches and methodologies ranging from an in-depth
    analysis of mitigation targets by big emitters to climate impact projections.
  3: Global mean temperature trajectories are derived using the reduced complexity
    carbon cycle and climate model MAGICC6.
  4: MAGICC6 model is used to generate GMSLR projections. Extreme temperature changes
    (TXx) are analyzed using a time-slicing approach. Economic damages are calculated
    based on the historical relationship between GDP growth and temperature variability
    and projected future temperature changes. GMSLR projections are from 1850 to 2300.
    Economic damages are calculated for mid-century (2046-2065) and end of century
    (2081-2100).
  5: "The paper uses scenarios with different levels of ambition to reduce GHG emissions\
    \ and projects the impacts on extreme temperatures and economic damages. The changes\
    \ in TXx are calculated with respect to 1986\u20132005 levels. The economic damage\
    \ model does not consider sea level rise. Projections are made for 2050 and 2100."
  7: The analysis compares climate impacts under different scenarios of mitigation
    ambition, considering global mean sea-level rise, annual maximum temperature increase,
    and GDP reductions for Least Developed Countries (LDCs). The analysis uses median
    values and also shows model ranges. The results are relative to the IPCC AR5 reference
    period 1986-2005.
  8: Uses climate models (GCMs) to project temperature changes and economic damages
    under different scenarios. Cumulative distributions of TXx change values are based
    on an area-weighted aggregation of projections at grid cells within regions. Economic
    damages are estimated as the percentage difference in GDP per capita between selected
    temperature pathways and a no-climate-change scenario. Analysis applicable to
    mid-century and end-of-century.
  9: Emission pathways are computed, and temperature and sea-level projections are
    provided. Economic damages are also estimated.
More Notes:
  3: The analysis uses the CAT (Climate Action Tracker) assessment of current pledges
    as a starting point.
  4: Radiative forcing levels are held constant at 2100 levels for the 22nd and 23rd
    centuries.
  7: "The study emphasizes the need for all countries to improve collective ambition\
    \ to limit warming to 1.5\u25E6C, and the reduction numbers from mitigation scenarios\
    \ cannot be easily extrapolated to individual NDCs of countries."
  8: "The paper uses different scenarios, including one reflecting current NDCs, a\
    \ BE33 scenario (resembling a 33% change in NDCs of big emitters), and a 1.5\xB0\
    C pathway."
  9: The analysis excludes LULUCF activities from the current NDC baseline pathway,
    assuming LULUCF contributions drop by the same percentage as non-LULUCF sectors.
    The paper highlights the need to translate overall percentage reductions back
    to each country's specific NDC language. The authors acknowledge Marshall Burke
    for making his code underlying the economic analysis openly available.
Quantitative material:
  1: "GDP reduction in tropical countries of around 60% compared to a no-climate-change\
    \ scenario under current NDCs up to 2100 and beyond; median long-term sea-level\
    \ rise of close to 2m in 2300 under current NDCs; increase in aggregated NDC ambition\
    \ of big emitters by 33% in 2030 does not reduce climate impacts by more than\
    \ about half compared to limiting warming to 1.5\u25E6C."
  2: "Provides projections for selected climate impacts (sea-level rise, extreme temperatures\
    \ and economic damages) for current NDCs and gradual reduction pathways in comparison\
    \ with a 1.5\u25E6C pathway."
  3: "G20 countries sum up to 38.3GtCO2eq. and for CAT countries to 40.3GtCO2eq.(G\xFC\
    tschow et al.,2016)."
  4: Economic damages are expressed in terms of gross domestic product (GDP). Land
    fraction distributions of changes in the intensity of the hottest day in a year
    (TXx) are calculated.
  5: "Under a 1.5\xB0C scenario, half of the land area TXx would increase by at least\
    \ 1.1\xB0C compared to current conditions. Under the NDC scenario, the global\
    \ median increase of TXx is projected to be 2.7\xB0C above the 1986\u20132005\
    \ level. In 2100, the median projections of damages to GDP per capita range between\
    \ 29% and 34% for the 1.5\xB0C pathway, between 43% and 50% for the BE33 scenario,\
    \ and between 57% and 66% for the baseline pathway of the current NDCs for selected\
    \ vulnerable regions."
