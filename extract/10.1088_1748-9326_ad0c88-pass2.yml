  4: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Human-induced increases in sea surface temperature (SST) in the North Pacific,
    specifically measured by Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) values.
  4: Ocean warming/Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
  6: Increasing sea surface temperatures (SST) due to anthropogenic influence.
  13: Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and FAR (unspecified).
Highlights:
  1: Temperatures in the North Pacific have reached levels that were likely impossible
    in the preindustrial climate. Increasing human influence on regional temperatures
    (increasing FAR values) is linked to negative effects on sockeye fishery catches.
  4: North Pacific SST has effectively become fixed in an anthropogenic state.
  6: Declines in sockeye harvests can be statistically related to the increasing evidence
    for human influence on Gulf of Alaska climate.
  13: "Observed and projected SST changes for various regions of the North Pacific\
    \ using CMIP6 models are presented. Model weights are used to combine model runs.\
    \ The relationship between a shape parameter (\u03C3D) and the proportion of 'true'\
    \ values falling between 10th and 90th quantiles of weighted prediction for North\
    \ Pacific warming rate is assessed."
Methodology:
  1: "Climate attribution techniques are applied to sea surface temperature time series\
    \ from five regional North Pacific ecosystems to track the growth in human influence\
    \ on ocean temperatures over the past seven decades (1950\u20132022). Bayesian\
    \ estimates of Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) and Risk Ratio (RR) derived\
    \ from 23 global climate models are used."
  4: Bayesian regression models are used to relate catch to SST and FAR values to
    SST. A categorical model compares fishery harvest for salmon entering the ocean
    under different levels of anthropogenic impacts. CMIP6 multi-model probability
    of extreme events was estimated with a weighted Bayesian regression using annual
    probability as the response variable and North Pacific warming level as a categorical
    explanatory variable. Analysis limited to catch years 1989-2022.
  6: Regression of sockeye salmon catches on SST and Fraction of Attributable Risk
    (FAR) values.
  13: Continuous regressions of catch on SST and FAR, including year as a covariate
    to account for serial dependence. Categorical model of the response of catch to
    high FAR values. Bayesian statistical methods with weakly informative priors (Student-t
    distribution and normal distribution) were used for all model parameters.
More Notes:
  1: Attribution time series may be helpful indicators for better defining the human
    role in observed climate change impacts, and may thus help researchers, managers,
    and stakeholders to better understand and plan for the effects of climate change.
  4: The paper uses the Gulf of Alaska sockeye salmon fishery as a case study to show
    how attribution time series can contextualize the human role in observed climate
    change impacts on ecosystem services.
  6: "FAR values for catch years 1989\u20132016 varied between 0.33 and 0.91, while\
    \ for 2017\u20132022, FAR = 0.98\u20130.99, indicating stronger anthropogenic\
    \ influence."
  13: The paper uses a 'perfect model setup' to select shape parameters for weighting
    CMIP6 models. Autocorrelation parameter included in catch models.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Impacts of human-induced ocean warming on ecosystem services, specifically sockeye
    salmon fishery catches.
  4: Gulf of Alaska commercial sockeye salmon fishery ex-vessel value (average of
    $64.4M USD during the last decade)
  6: Decline in sockeye salmon catches.
  13: Catch rates of Gulf of Alaska fish stocks.
Quantitative material:
  1: Sockeye salmon catches in years with FAR >= 0.98 are 1.4 standard deviations
    below the long-term log mean.
  4: "FAR (Fraction of Attributable Risk) values > 0.98 for at least part of the 2014\u2013\
    2019 marine heatwave period in all regional ecosystems; North Pacific SST has\
    \ FAR >= 0.99 for three-year running mean SST since 2003, and for annual SST since\
    \ 2013"
  6: Regression of sockeye salmon catches on SST confirmed the documented negative
    response of the fishery to recent warming.

    \ stocks. SST projections from 23 CMIP6 models."
