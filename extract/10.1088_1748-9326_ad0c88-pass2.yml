Drivers of Risk:
  1: Human influence on sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the North Pacific, particularly
    warming temperatures.
  2: Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, specifically increasing human influence
    over regional temperatures and ocean warming.
  3: Sea surface temperature changes impacting regional ecosystems in the North Pacific
    Basin
  4: Ocean temperature increases, particularly the increase in SST, are impacting
    the productivity of Gulf of Alaska sockeye salmon.
  5: Human-induced climate change, as inferred from Fraction of Attributable Risk
    (FAR) analyses, impacts SST anomalies.
  6: Anthropogenic influence on climate is a significant driver of changing sea surface
    temperatures, affecting the frequency and intensity of SST anomalies.
  7: The key driver of risk is the change in sea surface temperature both annually
    and averaged over three years in various North Pacific regions.
  8: The primary driver of risk is increasing sea surface temperature (SST), with
    specific attention to anthropogenic temperature effects.
  9: The primary driver of risk is increasing sea surface temperatures (SST) in the
    North Pacific, linked to human activities.
  10: Estimated warming of the entire North Pacific expected for the 15 year window
    centered on the year of interest (i.e. the year of the observed ERSST anomaly
    for which we are evaluating probability).
  11: SST (Sea Surface Temperature) trends, bias, variability, and autocorrelation
    are used as drivers.
  12: SST (sea surface temperature) values are used in relation to sockeye salmon
    catches.

Highlights:
  1: Human influence on regional ocean temperatures could first be detected in the
    1970s, and by 2014-2020 temperatures showed overwhelming evidence of human contribution;
    Temperatures in the North Pacific have reached levels likely impossible in the
    preindustrial climate; The strongest evidence for human influence is in the northernmost
    ecosystems (Eastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska); Increasing human influence
    on regional temperatures (increasing FAR values) links to negative effects on
    sockeye fishery catches.
  2: Attribution time series to document the evolution of human influence on North
    Pacific and regional SST. Evaluate changes in the expected return time for extreme
    SST events. Demonstrate the potential of attribution statistics for contextualizing
    climate change and informing adaptation decision-making by comparing outcomes
    for an ecosystem service (fisheries catch) under different degrees of human influence
    on the climate, and by providing estimates of climate risk to that service during
    historical, current, and next-decade climate states.
  3: No relevant information
  4: North Pacific SST is strongly attributed to human activities, with FAR values
    consistently above 0.98 since 2003 for three-year running mean SST and since 2013
    for annual SST.
  5: Significant SST anomaly increases are notably projected under the SSP5-8.5 scenario
    across all regions, with the highest increases in the North Pacific and Eastern
    Bering Sea.
  6: Human activities have significantly increased the likelihood of extreme SST anomalies,
    with FAR values often exceeding 0.99 in some regions; return times for extreme
    SST values have decreased rapidly.
  7: "SST values exceeding critical thresholds are expected to become more frequent;\
    \ projected to represent cooler-than-normal conditions with 1.5 \xB0C\u20132.0\
    \ \xB0C warming in the future."
  8: The study finds that human influence on North Pacific climate, particularly on
    temperature, extends back to the 1970s or early 1980s, and that the proportion
    of risk attributable to human activities has grown from detectable to overwhelming.
    Recent temperatures for the entire North Pacific have reached levels that are
    ascribed to human activities.
  9: The attribution of climate change to North Pacific temperatures has become obsolete.
    There is a rapidly increasing risk for events associated with fisheries failure.
    Warming since 2014 may be approaching a tipping point where preferred sockeye
    salmon temperatures are unavailable in the Gulf of Alaska, particularly in winter.
    Model uncertainty plays little role in their conclusions regarding anthropogenic
    influence on SST in recent decades.

  11: "A value of \u03C3S = 0.4 was adopted for all regions. Model weighting showed\
    \ a stronger effect of skill weight than independence weight. Model weighting\
    \ showed the most tendency toward model democracy for the North Pacific and Southern\
    \ California Current, and the strongest weighting for individual models in the\
    \ British Columbia Coast."
  12: Figures A2 and A3 show model skill, independence, and combined weights for CMIP6
    models in different study regions.
  14: The skill weight generally decreases across model numbers, the independence
    weight fluctuates and peaks around model number 22, and the combined weight remains
    low across all model numbers.
Methodology:
  1: Climate attribution techniques (Bayesian estimates of Fraction of Attributable
    Risk (FAR) and Risk Ratio (RR)) applied to sea surface temperature time series
    (1950-2022) from five regional North Pacific ecosystems, using 23 global climate
    models.
  2: "Calculates FAR and RR from individual ensemble members for 23 CMIP6 models using\
    \ normalized SST anomalies relative to the pre-1950 time series (1854\u20131949\
    \ for observations, 1850\u20131949 for CMIP6). Preindustrial probabilities were\
    \ estimated for each CMIP6 model as the proportion of SST anomalies from preindustrial\
    \ runs producing anomalies as large as or greater than the observed SST anomaly.\
    \ Present-day probabilities were calculated for each model using combined historical\
    \ and SSP5-8.5 runs. CMIP6 models were weighted to reward model skill and independence."
  3: Models evaluated using bias, trend, interannual variability, and autocorrelation
    of SST, weighted by a perfect model setup; multi-model estimates generated with
    Bayesian regression models
  4: The analysis employs Bayesian regression models to relate sockeye salmon catch
    to three-year running mean SST, using CMIP6 multi-model probability and Bayesian
    regressions to estimate potential future extremes in North Pacific SST.
  5: Utilizes CMIP6 model projections under historical, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios
    compared with observed ERSSTv5 data up to 2100.
  6: Bayesian posteriors with 95% credible intervals are used to determine the distinguishability
    of FAR values from zero; analysis of extreme event return times and regression
    analyses are mentioned.
  7: Analysis relies on multi-model estimates of Risk Ratios, historical data (ERSSTv5),
    and projections using two CMIP6 emissions scenarios (SSP 245 and SSP 585).
  8: The analysis uses Bayesian regression to relate SST and FAR to commercial catch
    anomalies. It also utilizes time of emergence studies and attribution time series
    to evaluate the evolution of human influence on North Pacific climate and marine
    heatwaves. The analysis extends to the 1970s or early 1980s.
  10: "Bayesian smoothed regression to the observed mean North Pacific SST time series\
    \ in order to isolate the warming signal from high-frequency noise... Warming\
    \ at the start and end of each 15 year window (in units of \u25E6C with respect\
    \ to the pre-1950 mean) was identified from the Bayesian regression model."
  11: "A perfect model setup is used to tune \u03C3D and \u03C3S, treating each CMIP6\
    \ model as 'truth' and calculating weighted predictions based on bias, trend,\
    \ standard deviation, and autocorrelation. Model weights are based on the absolute\
    \ difference between CMIP6 models and observations for trend coefficients and\
    \ standard deviation/autocorrelation, applicable to 1950-2014 (bias, variability,\
    \ autocorrelation) and 1973-2022 (trend)."
  12: A weighted average of SST values across the range of ocean entry years is used,
    with weights based on the mean proportion of sockeye entering the ocean in a particular
    year, calculated from age-structured data.
  14: The paper uses skill weight, independence weight, and combined weight to hindcast
    and project North Pacific warming using different models.
More Notes:
  2: "The study focuses on the North Pacific basin poleward of 20\xB0N and five northeast\
    \ Pacific regional ecosystems: Eastern Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, British Columbia\
    \ Coast, and Northern and Southern California Current."

  6: There are regional differences in SST anomaly impacts, with different expected
    frequencies of extreme events between regions.
  8: The study highlights the 'shifting baseline' syndrome related to the gradual
    increase in human influence, which presents an adaptation challenge. The relationship
    between SST and sockeye catch is negative above a certain SST threshold.
  9: The study acknowledges limitations in using global climate models for regional-scale
    analysis and notes potential uncertainties in the Eastern Bering Sea due to the
    role of atmosphere-ocean circulation.
  11: The paper describes a method for weighting climate models based on their ability
    to reproduce historical SST patterns, and uses this to project future warming.
  12: The South Alaska Peninsula was excluded from analysis because the majority of
    sockeye salmon harvests from that Management Area are for fish returning to Bering
    Sea natal streams.

Quantitative material:
  1: FAR > 0.98 for at least one year in all regions; Extreme regional SST values

    warming increments, and expected return times for extreme SST events.
  8: The paper includes Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) values, log commercial
    catch anomalies, and SST values (specifically noting a value of 2.08 above which
    negative effects on sockeye catch are observed). RR values on the order of 10^1
    - 10^4 are noted.
  10: "The probability of a given anomaly for \u2018present\u2019 conditions was then\
    \ calculated as the proportion of anomalies equal to or greater than the observed\
    \ anomaly within the relevant span of North Pacific warming that corresponded\
    \ with the 15 year window centered on the observation year."
  11: "Values of \u03C3D varied between 1.16 and 1.84 for the different regions."

    ranging from 0.25 to 1.0 in Figure A2 and model weights up to approximately 3.0
    in Figure A3.
  14: The figure presents skill, independence, and combined weights for North Pacific
    warming hindcasts and projections, showing values between 0.0 and 0.5 across different
    model numbers (0-25).
