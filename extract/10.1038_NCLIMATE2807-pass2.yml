Drivers of Risk:
  1: CO2 and CH4 emissions from thawing permafrost, anthropogenic emissions.
  2: Permafrost emissions of CO2 and CH4; global mean temperature increases; Changes
    in emissions; thawing of permafrost
  3: Thawing permafrost, CO2 and CH4 emissions from permafrost.
  4: Permafrost CO2 and CH4 emissions are identified as key drivers of economic impact
    under the IPCC AR4 A1B scenario.
Highlights:
  1: "Permafrost emissions increase the global mean temperature in 2100 by an additional\
    \ 0.17\u02DAC."
  2: Permafrost emissions significantly increase the economic costs of climate change.
    Aggressive abatement strategies are needed to reduce these costs.
  3: Permafrost emissions contribute to global mean temperature rise. The range of
    uncertainty in temperature projections increases over time.
  4: The projections indicate significant economic impacts due to permafrost emissions
    with steeper growth in impacts shown by different percentile groups within the
    PAGE9 model.
Methodology:
  1: Runs 100,000 simulations of the PAGE09 model, perturbing various model parameters.
  2: 'Uses the PAGE09 model to estimate economic impacts from permafrost emissions.
    The model considers physical processes and economic impacts, including nonlinear
    interactions. The analysis considers different socio-economic scenarios (A1B,
    SSP2, SSP3) and abatement scenarios (UK Met Office 2015r5low). It analyses the
    sensitivity of the model to six key parameters: TCR, the pure time preference
    (PTP) rate, the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption (EMUC), the permafrost
    emissions, the feedback response time (FRT) and the exponent of the non-economic
    impact function with temperature (POW_2).'
  3: The PAGE9 model is used to simulate temperature rise with and without permafrost
    emissions. The model is run 100,000 times with default settings.
  4: The PAGE9 model is used to estimate economic impacts and influence on NPV from
    permafrost emissions under the IPCC AR4 A1B scenario.
More Notes:
  1: The largest source of uncertainty is the transient climate response (TCR) to
    anthropogenic warming.
  2: The uncertainty range of the model results is wide due to the uncertainty in
    model parameters. Prior to this study, there had been no estimates of the possible
    extra economic impacts from permafrost emissions of CO2 and CH4.
  3: The analysis relies on the IPCC AR4 A1B scenario, which may not be the most up-to-date
    climate scenario. The paper focuses on temperature impacts rather than direct
    macroeconomic or fiscal impacts, but it provides essential climate impact data
    for macroeconomic assessments.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Mean net present value (NPV) of the impacts of climate change.
  2: Global GDP loss, measured as a percentage; NPV of extra economic impacts in US$;
    Extra Economic and non-economic impacts; probability of catastrophic events, such
    as thawing of Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets
  3: The paper examines the impact of permafrost thaw and associated CO2 and CH4 emissions
    on global mean temperature rise, which is an intermediate outcome that can lead
    to macroeconomic outcomes.
  4: Change in economic impacts from permafrost emissions quantified in US$ trillion
    per year, showing projected trends from 2000 to 2200.
Quantitative material:
  1: "In the default PAGE09 model the permafrost emissions increase the global mean\
    \ temperatures in 2100 by an additional 0.17\u02DAC (5-95% range: 0.11-0.25\u02DA\
    C) above temperature increases due to anthropogenic emissions."
  2: "Global mean temperature increases of 0.26\u02DAC in 2150 and 0.29\u02DAC in\
    \ 2200; Permafrost emissions represent about 10% of cumulative anthropogenic emissions\
    \ since pre-industrial times by 2200 and contribute about 7% of the total mean\
    \ warming; Mean annual value of extra impacts is about US $2.8 trillion in 2100\
    \ (about 0.35% of projected global GDP) and peaks at about US $30 trillion in\
    \ 2200 (about 0.7% of projected global GDP); NPV of extra economic impacts increases\
    \ to US$54 trillion and US$91 trillion under SSP2 and SSP3 socio-economic scenarios,\
    \ respectively, compared to the default PAGE09 model; Under an aggressive abatement\
    \ scenario (UK Met Office 2015r5low), the mean NPV of extra impacts falls to US$6\
    \ trillion, with a 5-95% range of US$ 0.4-17 trillion; An aggressive abatement\
    \ strategy will reduce the mean extra impact of emissions by about US$37 trillion."
  3: Figure 1 shows estimated annual emissions of CO2 from thawing permafrost (mean,
    5th and 95th percentile). Figure 3 shows global mean temperature rise relative
    to pre-industrial conditions with and without permafrost emissions (mean, 5th
    and 95th percentile).

    in output due to permafrost emissions, with monetary values from 0 to 100 US$
    trillion per year.
