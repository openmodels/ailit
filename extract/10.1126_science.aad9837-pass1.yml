Drivers of Risk:
  1: Current temperature climatologies, future warming, high temperatures, tropical
    cyclones, precipitation extremes
  2: Future anthropogenic climate changes causing warming.
  4: Climatic conditions/events
  5: Temperature increases increase death rates; extreme heat or cold, climatic conditions
    trigger violence or migrant flows; hot and cold environmental heat
  6: Immediate deaths from tropical cyclones; economic conditions post-cyclone causing
    increased mortality due to reduced spending on food and healthcare; climate-induced
    shifts in vector-borne disease patterns.
  7: Cyclone intensity; Temperature (heat, long-run climate, rapid/slow changes)
  9: Low rainfall slows national incomes greatly in Africa; Tropical cyclone strikes
    slow GDP growth; Temperatures have a nonlinear effect on economic production;
    Climatic events alter investment behavior or capital depreciation.

Highlights:
  1: Climate is a major factor, often with first-order consequences, affecting social
    and economic outcomes. Both current and future losses can theoretically be avoided
    if populations adapt to fully insulate themselves from the climate.
  2: The economic and social burden of current climates tends to be comparable in
    magnitude to the additional projected impact caused by future anthropogenic climate
    changes.
  3: The core of the empirical challenge is to credibly reconstruct the dose-response
    function for pairings of weather variables and social outcomes, while simultaneously
    accounting for the possibility that adaptations alter this relationship.
  4: Societal responses may persist (or reverse) after a climatic event ends, continuing
    through another event that generates another overlapping response, a characteristic
    impulse-response function can only be recovered from the original data by deconvolution.
  6: Economic conditions following tropical cyclones significantly affect long-term
    GDP and increase mortality rates due to reduced spending on essentials.
  7: Adaptation is evident in cyclone mortality rates and temperature-induced mortality
    in the United States, but limited adaptation is observed in maize yields and aggregate
    income at the county and country levels.
  9: Effects of temperature and cyclones are globally generalizable; Effects of temperature
    on income in the United States remained essentially unchanged from 1960 to 2010.
  10: Climate change is predicted to have significant negative impacts on agricultural
    yields, global GDP, and TFP in various regions.
  11: The current climate affects outcomes that we observe in the current world. Recent
    warming has affected outcomes. Changes in the climate are expected to alter social
    outcomes.
  12: Warming trends have slowed global average GDP growth and increased armed conflict
    in Sub-Saharan Africa; Future climate change is projected to increase U.S. mortality
    rates and electricity consumption, and decrease the growth rate of overall economic
    production.
Methodology:
  1: Quantitative empirical research drawing generalizable causal inferences tying
    climatic events to social outcomes.
  2: Quantitative empirical research using data and methods from climate, social,
    and statistical sciences.
  4: Longitudinal studies follow individual populations over time and examine how
    they respond to changes in the climate conditions that they face.  This involves
    deconvolution of the outcome as a series of responses to continuous climatic conditions
    to recover an impulse-response function. Once the full structure of a dose-response
    function, along with its dynamic properties, is identified for a specific population
    across different weather and climate conditions, researchers can simulate how
    a population might respond to distributions of weather events that differ slightly
    from historically experienced distributions with probabilistic assessment.
  7: Comparison of response functions over time and across space; Analysis of historical
    exposure and experience; Analysis of climate sensitivities and mortality rates;
    Analysis of yield changes relative to temperature; Analysis of income loss relative
    to temperature change.
  9: Examining how the macro-economy as a whole responds to climatic conditions; implemented
    by examining total income or gross domestic product (GDP) per capita as the outcome
    of interest.

  11: Uses empirical relationships to compute the distribution of outcomes predicted
    by the current distribution of climatic events; and compare this to the distribution
    of outcomes obtained if the same population were exposed to their best possible
    environmental conditions.
  12: Calculations using data from other studies.
More Notes:
  1: The authors point out that society may also benefit from attending to ongoing
    impacts of climate in the present, because current climatic conditions impose
    economic and social burdens on populations today that rival in magnitude the projected
    end-of-century impacts of climate change.
  4: The paper focuses on methodological approach to determining the impact of climate
    on social outcomes, not results.
  7: The analysis considers different contexts (countries, locations) and time periods
    to assess the effectiveness of adaptation strategies.
  9: Determining the persistence of GDP losses is important because enduring losses
    may accumulate and compound, leading to larger long-run losses.
