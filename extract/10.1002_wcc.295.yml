  1: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on water, agriculture, and biodiversity sectors in South
    Africa are key drivers of risk.
  7: Climate change impacts such as extreme weather events including fires, flooding,
    and storm surges.
  8: Climate change impacts (temperature, rainfall patterns, CO2 levels, extreme weather
    events) on biodiversity, agriculture, urban settlements, and human health sectors;
    Inadequate climate data and hydrological data.
  9: Climate change impacts (groundwater recharge, interactions between risks, regional
    variations in risks), Uncertainty around climate impacts and social/political/economic
    conditions, Institutional barriers (capacity, turnover, understanding, positioning
    of climate change, financial management, communication/coordination), Weak relationships
    between stakeholders
Highlights:
  1: South Africa has a well-developed earth system science research program and has
    developed climate change scenarios for the southern African region. Adaptation
    responses are emerging in certain sectors, and some city-scale and project-based
    adaptation responses have been implemented.
  7: Highlights include adaptation strategies involving community-based measures,
    ecosystem restoration, and a pilot project by an insurance company to manage climate
    risks.
  9: Adaptation requires dealing with uncertainty, collaborative research is needed
    to support robust/resilient/adaptive decision frameworks, Institutional design
    fostering adaptation is lacking, Weak relationships between stakeholders hinder
    adaptation, Intermediary organizations can translate science into policy
Methodology:
  1: The paper reviews current approaches and recent advances in research on climate
    impacts and adaptation in South Africa.
  7: Participatory modeling approaches and adaptation designs involving stakeholders
    were used to develop locally relevant adaptation plans in agriculture and water
    management.
  8: Synthesis of pre-existing studies with a range of approaches and climate scenarios
    for sectoral impacts; LTAS climate change scenarios used for impacts assessments.
  9: Integrated assessments, Synthesis of existing knowledge, Prioritization based
    on magnitude of impact and confidence in evidence, Case studies, Comparative studies
More Notes:
  1: "The National Climate Change Response White Paper has not yet translated into\
    \ policy that mainstreams adaptation. There is a need to develop South Africa\u2019\
    s capacity to undertake integrated assessments of climate change to support climate-resilient\
    \ development planning."
  7: The paper emphasizes the importance of organizational and institutional issues
    over modeling uncertainties in adaptation planning.
  8: This paper focuses on South Africa. It identifies gaps in knowledge and institutional
    challenges hindering effective climate change adaptation.
  9: Notes the importance of a mechanism similar to UKCIP for South Africa. Notes
    South Africa's National Climate Change Response White Paper outlines 'climate-resilient
    development' as a primacy. Points out the need to improve methods for communicating
    climate science and impacts findings to a wide audience.
