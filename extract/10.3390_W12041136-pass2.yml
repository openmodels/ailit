  6: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Droughts, water scarcity, land and water management decisions, degradation and
    desertification.
  4: Drought; changing climatic conditions; water supply scenarios; extraction patterns
  5: No relevant information
  6: Drought; climatic extremes; changes in productivity; land tenure insecurity;
    unequal access to resources; failure to include the value of economic activities
    and contributions of vulnerable people in assessments; environmental externalities
    (agro-chemical use, groundwater depletion)
  7: Drought, increasing upstream water extraction, inequalities in access to water.
  10: Water scarcity and drought may disrupt supplies of key food crops. Anticipation
    of high risks, low returns and poor economic prospects in drought-prone economies
    causes systematic underinvestment. Perpetuation of avoidable drought impacts on
    people who are already disadvantaged, dispossessed, or disenfranchised.
  11: Land and water management decisions that deepen vulnerability to droughts over
    time.
Highlights:
  1: Global economic assessments often fail to connect to holistic consideration of
    vulnerability at a local scale, routinely falling short of capturing systemic
    effects of land and water management decisions that deepen vulnerability to droughts
    over time.
  4: Impact and vulnerability assessments at the local level should ideally integrate
    ecosystem-based, people-centered and water-balanced approaches, and connect them
    across scales to national and global assessment processes including economic assessment,
    but in practice, this is demanding and no perfect examples were identified.
  5: No relevant information
  7: Drought has significant economic costs, but the value of the affected assets
    (livestock) was systematically underestimated in national statistical data.
  10: The global economic cost of uninsured drought risk goes beyond the cost of losses
    and damage caused by each drought event in the area where it hits.
  11: Available global assessments of the costs of continued and increasing risks
    also fall short of capturing the systemic effects of land and water management
    decisions that deepen vulnerability to droughts over time.
Methodology:
  1: Rapid review of experiences from selected nations and available literature documenting
    methodological approaches to assess drought impacts and vulnerability at the local
    level.
  4: Literature review focusing on assessment methods integrated across sectors, scales,
    and timeframes, considering vulnerable groups and informing adaptation actions
    at the local level, supported and coordinated globally; broad characterization
    of methods into ecosystem-based mapping and modelling, people-centered livelihoods
    approach, and basin-wide resource accounting focusing on water balance, availability
    and demand; discussions with drought management practitioners and policy-makers.
  5: No relevant information
  6: Mapping vulnerability; retrospective rapid value assessments of losses; modeling
    ecosystem management; modeling land-based production systems and their interaction
    with climate and global economic processes.
  7: "Impact assessment conducted following the 2008\u201311 drought."
  10: Multiscale, systemic approaches to drought vulnerability and risk assessment
    should be further reinforced on a global level. A coordinated international process
    is needed to ensure that the available methods for drought vulnerability assessment
    are systematically applied, coordinated and improved, to better inform global
    understanding.
  11: Multiscale, systemic approaches to drought vulnerability and risk assessment
    can be reinforced on a global level through an Intergovernmental Working Group
    based on effective policy and implementation measures for addressing drought under
    the UNCCD.
More Notes:
  1: National accounting systems often fail to recognize the contributions of vulnerable
    communities and the value of ecosystem services they rely on. Avoidable costs
    of drought, degradation, and desertification are underestimated globally.
  4: The review aimed to identify assessment methods that could inform adaptation
    actions. The focus was oriented primarily toward methods that could be applied
    at the local level.
  5: This page focuses on different approaches to drought vulnerability assessment
    (People-centred, Land/ecosystem-based, Water-balanced). It primarily discusses
    the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in the context of drought, land
    degradation, and climate change vulnerability. It doesn't directly quantify macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes, but rather evaluates the methodologies used to assess vulnerability.
  6: Vulnerability assessments based on physical mapping and modeling alone will not
    capture differentiated vulnerability related to unequal access to resources. Assessments
    may overlook the economic activities of women and marginalized land users. Complex
    land-based production systems require layering of different methods, modelling
    tools, and databases. Quantitative economic assessments of vulnerability can be
    controversial and raise difficult questions about equity issues.
  7: Growing upstream-downstream inequalities in water access exacerbate drought impacts,
    with some arguing that the economic benefits of upstream irrigation outweigh the
    costs to downstream communities. Trades and value chains destroyed alongside livelihoods
    have attracted increasing attention, and their net worth is growing.
  10: Wealthy governments are already counting the costs of coping with economic migration
    and security threats from regions where inadequate systems are in place to protect
    vulnerable populations and their ecosystems from drought.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: National GDP, losses for vulnerable people, costs of drought crises, costs of
    land degradation and desertification.
  4: No relevant information
  5: No relevant information
  7: Loss of economic growth due to drought.
  10: National economic growth rates and profiles are affected by negative perceptions
    of drought-prone areas, which hold back investment.
  11: Global economic assessments of drought impacts and the case for investing in
    proactive management approaches often fail to connect to holistic and inclusive
    local understandings of vulnerability; assessments also fall short of capturing
    the systemic effects of land and water management decisions that deepen vulnerability
    to droughts over time.

  7: The 2008-11 drought in Kenya caused Ksh 968.6 billion (US$12.1 billion) in lost
    production, productive assets, basic services and living conditions. The damage
    translated to a loss of economic growth at 2.8% per year for three years.
