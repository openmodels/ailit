  52: Temperature changes
Highlights:
  1: Rising temperatures could reduce U.S. economic growth by up to one-third over
    the next century.
  2: Rising summer temperatures have a pervasive negative effect on the growth rate
    of output of many industries in the U.S.
  3: Increased summer temperature decreases the annual growth rate of labor productivity.
    Increased fall temperature has the opposite effect. Summer temperatures have a
    pervasive effect on the cross section of industries in the U.S. Many sectors are
    negatively impacted by rising temperatures, including finance, services, retail,
    wholesale, and construction. Utilities benefit from an increase in the average
    summer temperature.
  4: Rising seasonal temperatures could significantly impact economic growth rates,
    emphasizing the need for disaggregated data by seasons and industries to fully
    understand these impacts.
  5: Establishes a connection between long-term temperature changes and economic activities;
    analyzes the effect of temperature on labor productivity.
  7: An increase in average summer temperature negatively affects the growth rate
    of GSP; the compositional effect of seasonal temperatures may affect the volatility
    of GDP growth, contributing to welfare costs associated with large temperature
    variations.
  8: The difficulty in identifying the effect of temperature on economic growth in
    the U.S. is confirmed; none of the temperature coefficients are statistically
    significant.
  9: Summer temperature increases are associated with statistically and economically
    significant reductions in GSP growth rates; fall temperature increases are associated
    with increases in GSP growth rates.
  10: Temperature increases can have no effect, a permanent impact on the level of
    output (Level Effect), or a permanent impact on both the level and growth rate
    of output (Growth Effect). The model is designed to show how temperature effects
    can be decomposed into Level and Growth Effects.
  11: Lagged temperatures are generally statistically significant, except for winter.
    Summer and Fall temperature effects do not change signs when considering lagged
    temperatures. The Wald test indicates the sum of contemporaneous and lagged temperature
    coefficients are statistically significant for Summer and Fall.
  12: Summer temperatures consistently show a negative effect on economic output,
    while the fall effect lost statistical significance post-1990. The impact is particularly
    strong in Southern states.
  13: The effect of average seasonal temperatures on GSP growth is analyzed, with
    a focus on the stability of these effects over time. The paper also studies the
    possibility that temperature affects economic growth through labor productivity.
  14: Summer temperatures have a significant negative effect on productivity growth.
    Fall temperatures also have a significant negative impact on productivity growth.
    These impacts are statistically significant at varying levels (1%, 5%, and 10%).
    The authors suggest a main mechanism through which summer and fall temperatures
    affect GSP growth is productivity growth, rather than employment growth.
  15: High temperatures negatively affect worker productivity, especially in interface
    areas. High temperatures negatively impact health, increasing hospitalization
    and death risks, potentially affecting the insurance sector.
  16: Spillover effects between sectors are noted, with high temperatures potentially
    affecting retail and real estate due to reduced shopping and property searching
    activities.
  17: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector show the largest negative impact on
    gross state product both pre- and post-1997.
  19: Increase in average summer temperature negatively affects retail, wholesale,
    and real estate sectors.
  20: Higher temperatures systematically affect a large cross-section of industries,
    which in total account for more than a third of national GDP. The growth rates
    of GSP in Southern states are particularly sensitive to summer and fall temperatures.
  21: The estimated summer temperature coefficient for the 10 warmest states is about
    three times as large as their whole-country counterpart. The impact of rising
    temperatures in the summer is non-linear.
  22: The effect of temperature on GDP growth is not driven by less developed states.
  23: Less developed states in the South are driving the strong negative effect of
    summer temperature on GSP growth.
  24: Summer temperature has a negative and significant effect on GSP growth in both
    the South region and the whole U.S.
  25: Widespread temperature effects on sectors other than agriculture are key to
    understanding economic impacts.
  26: Rising temperatures are projected to reduce U.S. GDP growth, with reductions
    potentially reaching 1.2 percentage points under a high emission scenario, which
    could equate to a one-third reduction of the historical average nominal U.S. GDP
    growth rate.
  27: Notable seasonal impacts on GSP are observed with varying significance levels,
    especially in summer and fall.
  28: Positive relationship between average fall temperature and growth is not supported
    in several robustness checks.
  29: Increase in average summer temperature has a strong negative effect on economic
    growth rates. The summer effect is generally robust to various definitions of
    seasons. The economic effect of summer temperatures is mainly driven by the months
    of July and August. Both summer and fall effects are robust to different aggregation
    and deseasonalization methods of temperature data.
  30: An increase in the average summer temperature has a significant and robust negative
    effect on GSP growth in U.S. states.
  31: Rising temperatures have heterogeneous effects on the cross section of industries.
    The effects of seasonal temperatures impact labor productivity. The effect of
    summer temperatures is stronger in states that are on average warmer.
  34: Some states exhibit high autocorrelation in GDP growth rates (e.g., Florida,
    Nevada, California). Temperature correlations between seasons are generally low.
  35: Temperature has statistically significant effects on productivity, particularly
    in the summer. Gross state product is negatively impacted by temperature both
    pre- and post-1997. Services sector negatively affected post-1997. Significant
    effects for Finance, insurance, and real estate pre-1997.
  38: Table A12 shows some statistically significant impacts of seasonal temperatures
    on the South in Spring and Summer, and on the Midwest in Fall. Table A13 shows
    some statistically significant impacts of seasonal temperatures on the Summer
    and Fall on a national scale.
  40: Temperature has a negative impact on Gross State Product in both pre- and post-1997
    periods. Agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector is most negatively affected
    by temperature changes.
  41: Temperature has statistically significant negative impacts on the GDP share
    of food services and drinking places, and insurance carriers and related activities;
    and statistically significant positive impact on arts, entertainment, and recreation.
    Real estate also has a statistically significant negative impact.
  42: Contemporaneous summer temperature has a statistically significant negative
    impact on productivity. 1-year lag spring temperature has a statistically significant
    negative impact on employment.
  44: Temperature has a statistically significant negative impact on gross state product,
    services, retail, wholesale, construction, and agriculture/forestry/fishing. There
    are also some sectors that appear to be positively affected.
  45: Temperature (both contemporary and lagged) appears to have statistically significant
    negative effects on the growth of some service sectors, particularly professional
    and business services, other services except government, food services and drinking
    places, real estate and insurance carriers and related activities.
  46: Significant negative impact of temperature in the South during summer as indicated
    by coefficients and p-values.
  47: Summer has a statistically significant negative impact. Finance shows a notable
    decrease. Insurance carriers show a prominent increase.
  48: Summer temperature increases result in changes in GDP growth of between -0.2
    and +0.2 standard deviations, depending on the specific industry.
  49: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector appears most sensitive to the inclusion
    of additional seasons.

    of its GSP relative to the entire country's GDP; robustness checks with alternative
    weighting schemes; robustness to Arellano-Bond estimation methodology is discussed
    in the appendix. The results are applicable at the state level within the country
    under analysis.
  10: "The paper uses a simple linear model (equation 5) to illustrate the quantitative\
    \ significance of growth effects compared to level effects of temperature changes\
    \ on output. The model considers current and lagged average temperatures. It simulates\
    \ three cases: No Effect (\u03B2 = \u03B2lag = 0), Level Effect (\u03B2 =\u2212\
    \ \u03B2lag =\u2212 0.170), and Growth Effect (\u03B2 =\u2212 0.170, \u03B2lag\
    \ =\u2212 0.153)."
  11: The authors estimate a regression equation (8) that relates GSP growth to contemporaneous
    and lagged seasonal temperatures, controlling for lagged GSP growth, state fixed
    effects, and year fixed effects. The sample period is 1957-2012. Regressions are
    weighted by constant GSP shares, and standard errors are clustered by year, by
    state, and by both dimensions.

    of temperature on GSP growth and labor productivity, with robustness checks in
    Section 4.3.
  14: Panel regressions of state productivity growth rate on temperatures, using data
    from 50 US states and the District of Columbia from 1990-2011. The model includes
    lagged dependent variable, state, and year fixed effects. States are weighted
    by their proportion of GSP. Standard errors are clustered by year, state, and
    both dimensions.
  15: Panel regressions are used to explore the composition of the effects of global
    warming, guided by microlevel evidence of possible mechanisms through which temperature
    may affect economic activities.

    post-1997 subsamples due to classification system changes.
  17: The analysis is based on coefficient estimates and standard errors, pre- and
    post-1997 period.
  19: Regression analysis using pre-1997 and post-1997 samples; standard errors clustered

  20: Panel regression of the growth rate of state-level GSP on temperatures; division
    of the U.S. into four regions (North, South, Midwest, and West) according to the
    U.S. Census Bureau classification.
  21: "Panel regressions of state GSP growth rate on seasonal temperatures are performed\
    \ using U.S. states, classified according to the Census Bureau. The sample period\
    \ is 1957-2012. All specifications include the lagged dependent variable, and\
    \ state and year fixed effects. States are weighted in the panel regression by\
    \ the proportion, averaged over the whole sample, of their GSP relative to the\
    \ region\u2019s GDP. Standard errors are clustered by year, by state, and by both\
    \ dimensions."
  22: Panel regressions are used. States are sorted in descending order according
    to average summer temperature. Each state is weighted by its relative GSP. State
    and year fixed effects are included. Standard errors are clustered at the year
    level.
  23: Regression analysis is used to investigate the effect of summer temperature
    on GSP growth, with a focus on less developed states (using HDI as a measure).
  24: Estimates equation (11), a regression model where GSP growth is a function of
    seasonal temperatures, an interaction between low development (HDI) and seasonal
    temperatures, lagged GSP growth, state fixed effects, and year fixed effects.
    The sample period is 1957-2012.
  25: Combines temperature projections from climate models with estimated impact coefficients
    to assess effects on GDP growth; assumes no adaptation or mitigation measures.
  26: "The analysis uses impact coefficients for summer and fall temperatures (\u03B2\
    \u02C6summer =\u2212 0.154 and \u03B2\u02C6fall = 0.102) to project the impact\
    \ of temperature changes on GDP growth, based on different emission scenarios\
    \ (B1, A1B, A2) and General Circulation Models (GCMs)."

    Robustness checks in Appendix A.6
  31: Uses weather data from 129 weather areas featuring 10,128 individual weather
    stations. Weather data are created by collecting the earliest available data from
    weather stations.
  34: Table A5 reports autocorrelations. Table A6 reports correlations. Table A7 uses
    panel analysis with clustered standard errors (by year and state) to assess the
    impact of seasonal temperatures on some outcome (details in Table 1 of the main
    text, not included here).
  35: Regression analysis using gridded data. Robustness checks on previous tables

  44: Regression analysis with standard errors clustered by year and state, testing
    the impact of temperature on gross state product and various sectors of the economy.
    Wald test for hypothesis testing.
  45: Regression analysis with standard errors clustered by year and by state. The
    table shows results robust to including a one-year lag of temperature. A Wald
    test's p-value is reported for the sum of coefficients on contemporary and lagged
    temperature.
  46: Analysis considers temperature coefficients in different regions and seasons,
    and uses contemporaneous and 1-year lag effects.
  47: Panel analysis using Arellano-Bond. Standardized regression coefficients are
    reported. Results are applicable to a national level.
  48: Arellano-Bond estimation is used. The analysis uses seasonal temperatures and
    their correlation across US states. It also uses standardized industry regressions,
    standardizing GDP growth rate and summer temperatures by their average volatilities.
  49: Arellano-Bond estimation; analysis is performed for pre-1997 and post-1997 periods
    with inclusion of additional seasons in the industry regressions.
  50: The analysis involves industry regressions from 1997-2011, split into different
    seasonal groupings (Fall/Summer/Spring/Winter). Box plots are used to visualize
    the results of these regressions.
  51: The analysis uses an Arellano-Bond model, with robustness checks. The results
    in Table A28 are for the period after 1997.
  52: The study uses gridded temperature data from the NOAA nClimDiv data set, temperature
    data aggregated by population, and includes 1-year lagged temperatures in some
    specifications. The paper also uses GMM estimators developed by Arellano and Bond
    (1991) to address dynamic panel data issues.
More Notes:
  1: The study uses state-level data to analyze the impact of temperature on economic
    growth.
  2: The negative impact of summer temperatures on economic growth is more pronounced
    in states with higher summer temperatures, particularly in the South.
  3: The paper documents the impact of temperature on economic activities through
    its impact on labor productivity.
  5: Unit of temperature is degrees Fahrenheit; examines the cumulative effect of
    adverse winter weather conditions and summer temperatures on annual growth rate
    of output; also consider alternative definitions of seasons in robustness checks.
  6: The data used for GSP spans from 1957-2012, depending on the source; industry
    output data spans 1963-2011; employment data spans 1990-2012.
  9: The opposite signs of the effects of summer and fall temperatures may explain
    the difficulty in obtaining statistically significant estimates using annual temperatures;
    the summer effect is more robust than the fall effect.
  10: The temperature shock considered is a permanent 1oF increase.
  11: The study focuses on growth effects versus level effects, and uses seasonal
    temperatures rather than annual temperatures due to the lack of statistical significance
    found with annual temperatures in a prior analysis.
  13: The labor productivity analysis is restricted to private industries due to data
    availability. The choice to analyze labor productivity instead of total factor
    productivity is based on data availability. Garofalo and Yamarik (2002) built
    a data set for state-level real capital stock, but the sample over which real
    GSP and real capital stock are deflated using the same method is limited, impairing
    the construction of a panel of total factor productivity series.
  14: The dependent variable is either productivity growth or employment growth. Productivity
    is defined as output over employment in the private sector. The paper finds that
    the association between average summer and fall temperatures and the growth rate
    of employment is not statistically significant.
  15: The paper suggests that the effects of global warming are not limited to agriculture-related
    sectors.
  17: Significance levels are indicated by asterisks (*, **, ***) attached to the
    standard errors.
  19: Analysis is performed at the U.S. state level and aggregated to GSP; results
    for the post-1997 sample are based on NAICS classifications. The pre-1997 sample
    could not be decomposed because SIC classifications do not allow for a decomposition
    of the Service and Finance/insurance/real estate sectors.
  20: The significance of the estimated coefficients for the South region can be attributed
    to the relatively higher average temperatures that characterize the states in
    this area.
  21: The analysis focuses on the impact of average seasonal temperatures in degrees
    Fahrenheit.
  23: The study combines estimated impact coefficients with projections of temperature
    changes to assess the long-term impact on U.S. economic growth.
  24: The negative effect of summer temperature is not driven by less developed states,
    but possibly by the industrial composition of more and less developed states.
    The standard errors reported are clustered by year and by state.
  26: The analysis focuses on the impact of temperature changes on economic growth,
    assuming no changes in the way seasonal temperatures affect economic growth.
  30: A positive, albeit weaker and less robust, effect of an increase in the average
    fall temperature on GSP growth is also found. The summer effect dominates.
  31: The study uses weather data from 1957-2012.
  34: The direction and magnitude of the impact of seasonal temperatures on the outcome
    in Table A7 is not clear without knowing what Table 1 in the main text measures,
    and without knowing the units of measurement.
  37: The table is a robustness check of a previous analysis. Statistical significance
    is denoted by asterisks. The specific climate-related shocks influencing the sectors
    aren't directly specified on this page, but are likely explored in the main text
    related to Table 4.
  38: The analysis uses gridded data (Table A12) and temperature data aggregated by
    population (Table A13). GSP weights are used in some panel regressions. The sample
    period for GSP calculation is 1957-2012.
  42: The impact of temperature varies by season and region. Standard errors are clustered
    by year and state, suggesting an attempt to account for autocorrelation and spatial
    correlation.
  44: The table shows the robustness of the results in Table 4 column 2 when including
    a one-year lag of temperature.
  45: Two sets of estimates are provided for each sector. The note in the bottom indicates
    that these estimates can be seen in the main body of the document in Table 4.
  47: The specific climate variable being analyzed is not explicitly stated on this
    page, but is implied to be related to temperature.
  49: This table presents robustness checks on the main results in Table 4, focusing
    on the inclusion of additional seasons in the industry regressions.
  51: The results should be interpreted with caution because of changes in NAICS codes
    post-1997. The effects of different seasons in different regions on outcomes are
    also reported.
  52: The paper acknowledges a discontinuity in the GDP-by-state time series at 1997
    due to a change from SIC to NAICS industry definitions and cautions against appending
    the two data series to construct a single time series from 1963 to 2017. The gridded
    temperature data set excludes Hawaii and the District of Columbia.

  20: "A 1\xB0F increase in average summer temperature is associated with a 1.30 percentage\
    \ points reduction in the output growth of the insurance sector (post-1997 sample).\
    \ Agriculture accounts for about 1% of national GDP. Food services and drinking\
    \ places account for about 2% of national GDP. Utilities and mining sectors account\
    \ for about 1.8% and 1.4% of national GDP, respectively. Effects of summer and\
    \ fall temperatures are statistically and economically significant in the South\
    \ region."
