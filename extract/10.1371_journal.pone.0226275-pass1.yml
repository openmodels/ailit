  13: Valuing natural habitats for enhancing coastal resilience
Highlights:
  1: Protecting and preserving natural habitats can contribute to enhance coastal
    resilience. Natural habitats can reduce property damage during storm events.
  2: Estimates the value of flood protection services provided by coastal wetlands
    and marshes to residential properties.
  3: Improved upon existing literature by using parcel-level property values for damage
    estimation, accounting for wave effects, and incorporating SLR impacts; provides
    insights on valuing natural habitats for coastal resilience and supports natural
    habitats restoration initiatives.
  5: The analysis emphasizes the significance of considering storm interactions with
    coastal wetlands and the impact of storm surge on New Jersey's Mid-Atlantic region.
  7: Natural habitats like coastal wetlands and marshes provide shoreline protection
    to residential properties by reducing flood damages. Sea level rise is expected
    to reduce marsh area and cause wetlands and marshes to migrate inland, converting
    into tidal flats.
  8: The presence of natural habitats can reduce the number of inundated residential
    parcels by up to 23.1% under current conditions and up to 3.7% under future conditions.
    Natural habitats can reduce mean parcel-level flood depths by a maximum of 4.8%
    and 13.9% under current and future conditions, respectively. The presence of natural
    habitats can decrease mean proportional property damages up to 4.4% under current
    conditions and up to 4.0% under future conditions.
  9: Natural habitats can reduce flood elevation and property damage during storm
    events; the flood protection value is highest in terms of absolute value for the
    50-year storm and Hurricane Sandy under current conditions and 2050 conditions.
  10: The presence of natural habitats is estimated to protect up to $13.1 million
    and $32.1 million of residential property damage under current and future scenarios,
    respectively.
  11: Coastal wetlands and marshes can significantly reduce property damage from storm
    surge, particularly during frequent, low-intensity storms. Sea level rise is predicted
    to cause a loss of marsh area and a transition of marsh types.
  12: Natural habitats can enhance resilience against frequent, low-intensity storms
    and offer protection to coastal communities and ecosystems from storm surge and
    sea level rise.
Methodology:
  1: The study combined coastal storm surge modeling (ADCIRC+SWAN) and economic analysis
    to evaluate the role of natural habitats in coastal flood protection. The Sea
    Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was used to project the potential migration
    and habitat transformation in coastal marshes due to SLR in the year 2050. A counterfactual
    land cover approach was implemented, where marshes were converted to open water
    in the model, to estimate the amount of flooding avoided due to the presence of
    natural habitats.
  2: Uses the Advanced Circulation model (ADCIRC) and Simulating Waves Nearshore model
    (SWAN) to compute storm surge flooding for historical and synthetic storms.  The
    Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) simulates changes in coastal wetlands
    and marshes due to SLR. Flood depths are combined with parcel-level property data
    to compute flood damages.
  3: Uses parcel-level property values to estimate avoided damages; accounts for storm
    wind-driven wave effects; incorporates SLR impacts on coastal wetlands and marshes;
    interdisciplinary team of coastal engineers, marine and social scientists collaborated
    with natural resources managers.
  4: Land use and land cover (LULC) information is collected from the Coastal Change
    Analysis Program (C-CAP) database, and frictional drag coefficients are used in
    the model to represent LULC effects.
  5: The research utilizes a storm surge and wave model leveraging historical and
    synthetic storm data, including the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM)
    for projecting changes due to sea level rise by 2050.
  6: The SLAMM model is used to simulate coastal wetland conversions due to different
    rates of SLR. It uses coastal elevation, LULC, tidal and shoreline information,
    wave action, accretion rate, and the rate of SLR. The LULC data is collected from
    the USFWS National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) and converted to C-CAP types. A 10
    meter resolution DEM was prepared using the US Geological Survey (USGS) National
    Elevation Dataset. Tidal information was collected from the National Oceanic Atmospheric
    Administration (NOAA) tidal data for New Jersey.
  7: The damages avoided method was applied. Flood elevations were simulated for "habitat
    present" and "habitat absent" scenarios using the ADCIRC+SWAN model. Flood damages
    were estimated using depth-damage functions from the USACE, parcel-level property
    data from the New Jersey Department of Treasury, and mean flood depth from ADCIRC+SWAN.
    ArcStormSurge in ArcGIS was used to create flood elevation rasters. The analysis
    focused on residential parcels and their associated "improvement" value. The results
    are applicable to current and future LULC conditions in the study area.
  8: The study uses SLAMM to simulate land cover change, and ADCIRC+SWAN to estimate
    flooding with and without natural habitats under current and future conditions.
    The impact of natural habitats is evaluated by comparing outcomes (flooded parcels,
    flood depths, property damage) with and without their presence.
  9: ADCIRC+SWAN model used to simulate flooding with and without habitat present
    under current conditions and a Hurricane Sandy storm event.
  10: The analysis focuses on parcel-level property damages in a cross-section of
    three coastal counties in New Jersey, examining current and future (2050 SLR scenario)
    storm conditions.
  11: The study uses a coupled hydrodynamic and wave model. The SLAMM model is used
    to predict marsh migration and transition due to SLR by 2050.
  12: The analysis estimates flood depth reduction by comparing two scenarios using
    the same model formulation, focusing on storm events and using a multidisciplinary
    framework.

More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on three coastal counties in New Jersey adjacent to the Jacques
    Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve (JCNERR).
  2: Focuses on integrating the natural variability of coastal storm surge and impacts
    of SLR into the economic valuation of flood protection services.
  3: The study area is the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve (JCNERR)
    and surrounding counties in New Jersey.
  6: The start date for the DEM and NWI in the SLAMM model is set to the year 2010.
    The paper acknowledges uncertainties and limitations in projecting future SLR
    and coastal landscape or salt marshes response to projected SLR. The study utilized
    available data and recommendations by natural resources managers of the JC NERR
    based on their natural habitats restoration initiatives to develop the future
    scenario.
  7: 'Two additional assumptions were made for the analysis: 1) if a parcel had a
    non-integer number of stories, then that number was rounded up, 2) depth-damage
    functions for properties without basements were used based on anecdotal evidence.'
  9: The study focuses on Ocean County, New Jersey. The results are presented for
    both current conditions and future (2050) conditions, considering different storm
    events.
  11: The effectiveness of natural habitats varies depending on storm characteristics
    and location. A parcel-scale analysis is necessary to accurately assess the flood
    protection services of coastal wetlands and marshes. The model has limitations
    in representing wave energy dissipation by different plant characteristics.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Salt marshes can reduce up to 14% of both flood depth and property damage during\
    \ relatively low intensity storm events. Avoidance of up to $13.1 and $32.1 million\
    \ in residential property damage in selected coastal counties during the \u2018\
    50-year storm\u2019 simulation and Hurricane Sandy under current sea level conditions,\
    \ and in the year \u20182050 SLR scenario\u2019, respectively."
  2: Quantifies flood damages to residential properties in three coastal counties
    in New Jersey, with and without the presence of natural habitats, under both current
    and future conditions.
  3: "Wave setup contributed to 17% of the peak water level during most hurricane\
    \ events during 1988\u20132015 in the US coast."
  5: The study assesses storms with a 4% (25-year storm) and 2% (50-year storm) probability
    of occurrence annually based on historical surge and meteorological data.
  6: "SLAMM estimated a total 0.1332m of SLR in the year 2050 for their study area,\
    \ 1.7 millimeters per year of SLR is used based on the IPCC\u2019s Special Report\
    \ on Emissions Scenarios A1F1, an average of 4 millimeters per year of accretion\
    \ is applied in the model"
  7: The analysis predicts a 5.4% reduction in total marsh area due to SLR and marsh
    migration. Transitional salt marshes and irregularly flooded marshes are predicted
    to decrease by around 38% and 36%, respectively. Assessed building values ranged
    from $15 to $5,690,000, with a mean of $151,898, and 80% of the buildings are
    valued at $200,000 or less.
  8: 'SLAMM simulated land cover change: Developed Dry Land decreased by 0.10%, Freshwater
    Swamp decreased by 0.02%, Inland Fresh Marsh decreased by 0.23%, Tidal Fresh Marsh
    decreased by 4.80%, Transitional Salt Marsh decreased by 37.67%, Regularly-flooded
    Marsh increased by 274.65%, Mangrove decreased by 0.59%, Estuarine Beach increased
    by 1.28%, Tidal Flat increased by 2,506.14%, Ocean Beach increased by 1.31%, Inland
    Open Water decreased by 10.46%, Riverine Tidal decreased by 56.36%, Estuarine
    Open Water increased by 1.29%, Open Ocean remained at 0.00%, Irregularly Flooded
    Marsh decreased by 35.49%, Inland Shore decreased by 0.00%, Tidal Swamp decreased
    by 0.76%.'
  9: Coastal wetlands and marshes in the JCNERR can lower flood elevation by a maximum
    of 0.2 to 0.4 meters, but the averaged reduction in flood elevation and depth
    varies from 0.03 to 0.06m; natural habitats can reduce total property damage in
    the study area up to 13.8% under current conditions and up to 6.1% in future conditions;
    avoided damage by natural habitats during a single storm event can range from
    $8,500,000 to $13,000,000 under current conditions, while the value varies from
    $1,500,000 to $32,000,000 under 2050 conditions.
  10: Quantitative information includes property damages with and without natural
    habitats present, as well as avoided damages due to natural habitats, with percent
    changes offered for various storm scenarios.
  11: Natural habitats can reduce total property damage from storm surge flooding
    by 6.1% to 13.8% within the study area, specifically during the 50-year storm
    event. A maximum reduction of 0.2 to 0.4m in flood depth is observed due to the
    presence of natural habitats in the JCNERR. A loss of 5.4% of the total marsh
    area in the study area is predicted by 2050 due to SLR. Tidal flats are predicted
    to increase nearly twenty-six-fold.
