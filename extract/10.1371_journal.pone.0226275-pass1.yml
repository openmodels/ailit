Drivers of Risk:
  1: Storm surge and sea level rise (SLR) impacting coastal communities, properties,
    and ecosystems.
  2: Coastal flooding from storm surge, sea level rise (SLR), natural variability
    of coastal storm surge, impacts of SLR on natural habitats (coastal wetlands and
    marshes).
  3: No relevant information
  5: Storm surge, waves, sea level rise (SLR), natural habitat changes, Hurricane
    Sandy (2012), synthetic storms (25-year and 50-year storms).
  7: Storm events and sea level rise (SLR).
  8: Sea level rise, storm events (25-year storm, 50-year storm, Sandy), changes in
    land cover type
  9: Storm events (Hurricane Sandy), sea level rise.
  10: Storm events (25-year, 50-year, Hurricane Sandy); Sea Level Rise (SLR).
  11: Storm surge flooding, sea level rise (SLR), storm characteristics (track, location,
    intensity).
  12: Storm surge, sea level rise, extreme flooding events
Highlights:
  1: Natural habitats like salt marshes significantly reduce property damage from
    storm events, demonstrating efficacy in natural flood protection.
  3: The study improves upon existing literature by offering spatially explicit results
    and incorporates storm-driven wave effects and sea level rise impacts.
  7: Natural habitats, specifically coastal wetlands and marshes, provide shoreline
    protection that can be valued by estimating the flood damages avoided. Marsh area
    is expected to decrease with sea level rise.
  8: The presence of natural habitats can reduce the number of residential parcels
    inundated, decrease flood depths, and decrease property damages.
  9: Presence of natural habitats can significantly reduce flood damage from storm
    events, with potential savings in the millions of dollars. The percentage changes
    are highest under the 50-year storm event.
  10: Natural habitats can protect up to $13.1 million and $32.1 million of residential
    property damage during the selected storm events in the study area in the current
    condition and the future scenario respectively. One square kilometer of natural
    habitats can reduce residential property damages in the study area from $34,000
    to $53,000 under current conditions and from $7,000 to $138,000 under future conditions
    for the selected storm events.
  11: Natural habitats can significantly reduce property damage from storm surge flooding,
    particularly during frequent, low-intensity storms.
  12: Natural habitats can reduce storm surge flood depth and property damage under
    current and future marsh conditions and sea level rise; Natural habitats may offer
    better protection from relatively frequent, low-intensity storms; Ecosystem service
    values are conservative estimates.
Methodology:
  1: Combined coastal storm surge modeling and economic analysis. Used ADCIRC+SWAN
    models for simulating flooding from historic and synthetic storms and Sea Level
    Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) for projecting habitat transformation.
  2: Coupled version of Advanced Circulation model (ADCIRC) and Simulating Waves Nearshore
    model (SWAN) was applied to compute storm surge flooding for historical and synthetic
    storms. Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was used to simulate changes
    in natural habitats due to SLR. Simulated flood depths were combined with publicly
    available parcel-level property data to compute flood damages for storms in current
    and future conditions. Reduction in damages due to natural habitats estimated
    based on value of protected residential properties.
  3: The study incorporates parcel-level property values for avoided damages and includes
    wave setup in its assessment.
  5: Modeling storm surge and wave impacts using historical and synthetic storms;
    applying SLAMM to project changes in natural habitats due to SLR by 2050; using
    Garret's drag law to address land cover; modeling storm surge with Manning's n.
  7: The 'damages avoided' method is used to value shoreline protection by natural
    habitats. Flood elevations are simulated for 'habitat present' and 'habitat absent'
    scenarios using the ADCIRC+SWAN model. The difference in residential flood damages
    between these scenarios is the value of the reduced damages provided by natural
    habitats. Flood damages are estimated using depth-damage functions from the USACE,
    parcel level property data, and mean flood depth from ADCIRC+SWAN.
  8: SLAMM (Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model) is used to simulate land cover change.
    ADCIRC+SWAN is used to model flooding with and without natural habitats.
  9: ADCIRC+SWAN model is used to simulate flooding with and without habitat present
    under current and future conditions.
  10: Place-based analysis focused on flood protection services by coastal wetlands
    and marshes within and adjacent to the JCNERR (Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine
    Research Reserve) to a cross-section of three coastal counties in New Jersey.  It
    estimates the value of flood protection services provided by natural habitats.
  11: The study uses a hydrodynamic and wave model to assess the impact of natural
    habitats on storm surges.
  12: Model uses relative difference between two scenarios with same model formulation
    to estimate potential of natural habitats to reduce flood depth; Considers three
    storm events; Analyzes protection to residential structures
More Notes:
  3: The study involved an interdisciplinary team and focuses on valuing natural habitats
    for coastal resilience and supporting restoration initiatives.
  5: The study aims to capture variations in coastal flooding. The authors acknowledge
    limitations of using Manning's n and highlight the importance of including wave
    dissipation and attenuation by vegetation in modeling approaches. Model improvement
    is beyond the scope of this study.
  7: The study area included 103,927 residential parcels after removing parcels with
    missing information on assessed value or building characteristics. Depth-damage
    functions for properties without basements were used.
  8: The study analyzes the impact of natural habitats on flood risk reduction under
    current and future sea level rise scenarios.
  9: The study focuses on coastal wetlands and marshes in the JCNERR. The flood protection
    value in absolute terms is highest for the 50-year storm and Hurricane Sandy under
    current conditions and 2050 conditions.
  10: While the per-area value of protective services for both Sandy and the 50-year
    storm increased in the SLR scenario, the value decreased for the 25-year storm.
  11: Marsh migration and transition are predicted due to SLR by 2050, leading to
    a 5.4% loss of total marsh area in the study area.
  12: Emphasizes primary data collection in coastal wetlands and marshes during storm
    events for improved quantification of flood reduction capacity.
