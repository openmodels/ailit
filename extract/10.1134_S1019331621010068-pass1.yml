Drivers of Risk:
  2: Global climate change leading to permafrost thawing and degradation.
  3: "Permafrost thawing and degradation due to climate change, specifically a 2\xB0\
    C increase in average annual air temperature reduces the bearing capacity of foundation\
    \ piles."
  4: Permafrost thawing and degradation.
  5: Permafrost thawing and degradation effects on the sustainability of residential
    buildings.
  6: Permafrost degradation due to climate change, specifically thawing and reduction
    in bearing capacity of soils.
  7: Thawing of permafrost due to climate change.
  8: Permafrost degradation due to global climate change, including increased thaw
    depth and permafrost temperature.
  9: Climate change; Permafrost degradation; Loss of bearing capacity of permafrost
    soils.
Highlights:
  2: Permafrost degradation in the Russian Arctic will lead to significant costs for
    housing maintenance and restoration, with Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug and Krasnoyarsk
    krai experiencing the maximum expected loss.
  3: The housing sector in the Russian Arctic is particularly vulnerable to permafrost
    thawing, requiring specific assessment. High level of urbanization of the Russian
    Arctic determines the specifics of the functioning and development of the housing
    sector.
  4: The study focuses on the economic impact of permafrost degradation on the housing
    sector in the Russian Arctic regions, specifically estimating the loss to the
    housing stock by 2050.
  5: Housing stock growth is forecast for Russian Arctic regions under different scenarios,
    considering permafrost degradation.
  6: "A significant portion of the housing stock in several Russian regions is built\
    \ on permafrost, and permafrost degradation poses a significant economic risk\
    \ to this housing stock. The total cost of housing on permafrost is estimated\
    \ at \u20BD4.1 trillion, and the expected loss due to degradation by 2050 is estimated\
    \ in the range of \u20BD420 billion to \u20BD2.5 trillion."
  7: Significant economic costs are associated with permafrost thaw in various regions
    of Russia, particularly impacting housing and infrastructure.
  8: Permafrost degradation leads to significant socioeconomic losses in the Russian
    Arctic, requiring substantial investment in mitigation and adaptation measures,
    particularly in the housing sector. The Yamalo-Nenets AO and the Republic of Sakha
    (Yakutia) will suffer the greatest losses.
  9: "Assessments should be used in the development and implementation of strategic\
    \ planning documents directly related to the country\u2019s Arctic region, primarily\
    \ the National Adaptation Plan and the Strategy for the Development of the Russian\
    \ Arctic until 2035."
Methodology:
  2: Economic assessment and forecasting of permafrost thawing consequences on the
    housing sector in eight Russian Arctic regions, based on the most negative IPCC
    scenario (RCP 8.5).
  3: Analysis and assessment of the impact of permafrost thawing on the housing sector
    in the Russian Arctic regions, applicable to the conditions in 2018.
  4: Economic assessment based on the total size of the housing stock and the actual
    cost of housing construction. Calculates the total size of the housing stock built
    in the permafrost zone using data from the International Permafrost Association
    (IPA). Valuates the housing stock using Rosstat data on the current cost of construction.
    Determines expected permafrost thawing and degradation loss for the housing stock
    up to 2050.
  5: Two scenarios (conservative and modernization) are used to forecast housing stock
    growth. Six global climate models are used to assess the impact of permafrost
    thawing on residential buildings. The most severe climate change scenario (RCP8.5)
    is used. Analysis applies to the period up to 2050.
  6: The authors used data on permafrost temperature and thaw depth obtained from
    previous studies using geotechnical models. They assessed the risks of decreasing
    stability of housing stock in the regions studied under minimum, average, and
    maximum loss of bearing capacity scenarios. The cost estimate was based on the
    cost of construction of 1 m2 of living space in the region. Rosstat data was used
    to estimate housing stock.
  7: The analysis covers the period 2020-2050, with some values presented as annual
    costs. The methodology seems to involve modeling or estimation of economic losses
    associated with thawing permafrost and damage to infrastructure.
  8: Forecast-based economic assessment of socioeconomic losses due to permafrost
    degradation in eight regions of the Russian Arctic, considering average and maximum
    scenarios of changes in permafrost temperature and thaw depth, and a modernization
    scenario with accelerated housing construction.
  9: Methodology for assessing the costs of reducing the risk due to loss of bearing
    capacity of permafrost soils; Scenario modeling.
More Notes:
  2: The analysis focuses on the housing sector in the Russian Arctic and does not
    explicitly address broader macroeconomic or macro-fiscal implications beyond this
    sector.
  4: The analysis disregards factors such as housing demand/supply, living standards,
    wage dynamics, and bank rates/mortgage lending due to a lack of reliable long-term
    forecasts. Population is assumed to be constant until 2050 due to uncertainty
    in long-term population forecasts.
  5: The paper focuses on the impact of climate change on housing stock in Russian
    Arctic regions and models housing stock growth under different scenarios.
  6: "The regions studied include Komi Republic, Nenets AO, Khanty\u2013Mansi AO,\
    \ Yamalo-Nenets AO, Krasnoyarsk krai, Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Magadan oblast,\
    \ and Chukotka AO. Kamchatka krai is excluded from the calculations."
  7: The economic losses are presented with both minimum and maximum values, suggesting
    uncertainty or scenario-based analysis. The units are in billion rubles, using
    2011 prices. The paper uses regions of Russia as the unit of analysis at the national
    level.
  8: The analysis does not include indirect costs associated with reserve housing,
    temporary evacuation, or resettlement.
  9: Focus on technological solutions (increased strength characteristics of structural
    materials, energy-efficient and 'green' technologies) for housing in northern
    regions.  References strategic planning documents (National Adaptation Plan, Strategy
    for the Development of the Russian Arctic until 2035).

Quantitative material:
  2: "Under a conservative scenario, the annual average cost will exceed \u20BD30\
    \ bln in 2020\u20132050. With a modernization scenario, the cost increases to\
    \ \u20BD36 bln."
  4: 'Formulas (1) and (2) describing the calculation of housing stock area built
    on permafrost and the total cost of the housing stock, respectively. Assumptions:
    90% of housing stock in continuous permafrost zone is built on permafrost; 50%
    in discontinuous permafrost; 10% in massive-island permafrost; 0% in sporadic
    permafrost. Considers current (2019-2025) plans for mid-term housing stock development
    and assumes stock remains unchanged from 2025-2050.'
  6: "In 2018, approximately 20.6 million square meters of housing stock in the regions,\
    \ with a total cost of \u20BD4.1 trillion, were built on permafrost. Expected\
    \ loss to the housing sector from permafrost degradation for the period 2020\u2013\
    2050 is estimated in the range from \u20BD420 bln to \u20BD2.5 trillion, depending\
    \ on permafrost temperature and thaw depth. Based on the average scenario, the\
    \ loss is expected to reach \u20BD907 bln (18.8% of the total cost of housing\
    \ built on permafrost)."
  7: "Economic losses in billion rubles, with ranges for different scenarios and regions\
    \ (e.g., Komi, Nenets, Khanty\u2013Mansiysk, Yamal\u2013Nenets, Krasnoyarsk, Yakutia,\
    \ Magadan Oblast, Chukotka)."
  8: "Annual cost of mitigation: \u20BD30 bln (0.25% of GRP in 2018 prices); Cost\
    \ of maintaining housing stock may triple to \u20BD95 bln annually (1% of GRP);\
