Drivers of Risk:
  4: Water shortage due to basin water demands, potentially exacerbated by climate
    change leading to dry years; Environmental flow requirements exceeding river runoff
  6: Climate change (IPSL-CM5A-LR coupled Global Circulation Model using the RCP6.0
    climate scenario), Socio-economic factors based on the Shared Socio-economic Pathways
    (SSP2) scenario, Drawdowns (well yield, increased surface water)
  11: Changes in operational surface water availability (OSWA), operational groundwater
    availability (OGWA) and operational freshwater availability (OFWA) under different
    climate scenarios.
Highlights:
  4: Operational surface water availability (OSWA) is crucial for economic activities;
    Water shortages can occur even under pristine conditions in dry years, but are
    increased by basin water demands; The analysis highlights the importance of environmental
    flow requirements in water resource management
  11: The study focuses on quantifying trends in operational freshwater availability
    under IPCC scenario-based trends.
Methodology:
  4: The analysis uses a water balance model considering pristine runoff, actual runoff
    (after human water consumption), and environmental flow requirements; Operational
    Surface Water Availability (OSWA) is defined as river runoff minus environmental
    flow requirements, limited by physical and regulatory constraints
  6: 'The study uses a combination of models: PCR-GLOBWB (global hydrological model),
    MODFLOW (global groundwater model (GGWM)), and iMOD modeling software. PCR-GLOBWB
    simulates water storages and fluxes, forced by ERA-Interim_GPCP data (1980-2010)
    and IPSL-CM5A-LR data (1980-2065). The river runoff was calibrated. The global
    groundwater model simulates lateral shallow and deep groundwater flows, and the
    downscaled groundwater model computations are used. The study simulates the whole
    river basin upstream of the assets.'
  11: The study uses the PCR-GLOBWB model, downscaled to 90m resolution, to project
    OSWA, OGWA, and OFWA under different IPCC scenarios. Regime graphs are computed
    using 30-year and 10-year time slices.
More Notes:
  4: The study focuses on globally attainable measures and excludes artificial redistribution
    networks due to the lack of global mapping; It considers a grid resolution of
    approximately 45 by 45 km at the equator; Operational freshwater availability
    consists of surface and groundwater
  11: The study defines and models operational surface water, groundwater, and freshwater
    availability, including lateral groundwater flow. The specific study areas are
    LRME and LBB.
