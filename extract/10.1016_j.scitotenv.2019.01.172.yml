Drivers of Risk:
  3: Climate change impacts on crop yields (influenced by local climate variables
    like precipitation, temperature, and drought, as well as large-scale climate patterns
    like ENSO, NAO, and IOD), export bans by major crop producers, and reliance on
    a few exporters for food imports.
  4: Climate (implied), though not directly stated as a risk driver on this page.
  5: Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Air Temperature Anomalies (ATa), Sea Surface
    Temperature Anomalies (SSTa)
  8: Unusual favorable or extreme climatic patterns are identified as drivers of crop
    yield anomalies.
  13: Local climate variability (ATa, ATa-lag, PDSI, PDSI-lag)
  14: 'Local climate variability (represented by Principal Components PC1-PC3), assessed
    with one-year lag, concurrent, and one-year lead conditions; the image presents
    this variability under two indices: ATa and PDSI.'
  23: Climate extremes (floods and droughts), increasing demand for meat and dairy,
    disconnected food production and consumption regions, local climatic patterns,
    large-scale climatic patterns and climatic oscillations (TSA, SAM, QBO, ENSO,
    NAO).
  24: Climate variability (specifically ENSO, NAO, SAM or PDO), cropland coverage
    changes, limitations in yield data separating rain-fed and irrigated crops, other
    factors impacting crop productivity (technological advances, seeds improvement,
    using fertilizers, farm ing practices, political issues, social strife and civil
    unrest, strategies applied for food security at regional scales, regional shortages
    of energy and water).

Highlights:
  1: Identifying the most important modes of crop yield variability and their association
    with climate, and identifying co-varying countries and joint dependencies between
    crop yields.
  3: Countries dependent on crop imports are vulnerable to export bans imposed by
    major producers during climate-related food crises, potentially leading to widespread
    hunger. Identifying countries with similar/dissimilar yield patterns can help
    in trading excess crops during food scarcity. Recognizing the climatic variables
    that drive these synergistic variabilities across countries is of great importance.
  4: Identifies co-varying crop producers and joint dependencies between crops. Presents
    the relationship between the main PCs and local climate and co-varying countries.
    Discusses joint dependencies between crop yield variability.
  8: The study identifies countries with large loading values (LLVC) as significantly
    important because they co-vary similarly/oppositely and explain the variance of
    each PC the most.
  13: Local climate variability significantly impacts productivity in maize, rice,
    sorghum, and soybean croplands, with varying degrees of impact depending on the
    crop, region, type of climate variable (ATa, PDSI, lag), and Principal Component.
  14: More than half of maize croplands in France, Hungary, Romania, South Africa,
    US and Pakistan, rice in Brazil, Bangladesh, South Korea, sorghum in South Africa,
    Canada, US, Indonesia and Viet Nam and soybean in Italy, Romania, Turkey, Canada,
    Mexico, US, Argentina, Viet Nam and Japan impacted by local climate in at least
    one PC.
  23: Local climate variability significantly impacts maize, rice, sorghum, and soybean
    croplands in various regions. Large-scale climate patterns influence crop yield
    variability. ENSO and NAO are dominant climate oscillation patterns in the first
    three PCs of the crops.
  24: Identified co-varying countries (especially import-dependent ones) could take
    advantage of the favorable impacts of climatic patterns in other countries to
    mitigate negative impacts on crop yields. This could improve global food security
    through strategic trading partnerships in emergencies.

Methodology:
  4: Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) is used to decompose yield time series
    of maize, rice, sorghum and soybean (MRSS) from 1961 to 2013. The modes or principal
    components (PC) are used to assess the association between crop yields and climate
    and to identify co-varying crop producers and joint dependencies between crops.
  5: Detrending yield values using a seven-year moving window. Using Palmer Drought
    Severity Index (PDSI) that integrates precipitation and temperature and is highly
    correlated with soil moisture content.
  7: The L matrix exhibits detrended yields without outliers, while the S matrix contains
    simultaneous anomalous values.
  8: Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) is used to decompose yield anomalies.  Correlation
    analysis is mentioned as a method to find links between PCs with other variables.
    The study analyzes data from 1964 to 2010.
  13: Statistical analysis correlating local climate variability (ATa, PDSI, and their
    one-year lags) with crop yield variabilities in different Principal Components
    (PCs). Applicable to MRSS (maize, rice, sorghum, soybean) croplands.
  14: Analysis of the influence of different principal components on specified crops
    across various regions and temporal conditions (lag, concurrent, and lead scenarios);
    using bar charts to represent these impacts.
  23: Analysis of historical correlations between climate patterns and crop yield
    variability to understand crop yield variability and joint dependencies between
    countries. Spatial coverage of croplands used in the study is based on the year
    2000.
  24: Focuses on climate's impact on crop yields. Identifies co-varying countries
    based on climatic patterns and their impacts on crop yields. Uses statistical
    forecasts (e.g., from NOAA) to predict climatic patterns like PDO.

More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on crop yields, which could be a precursor to macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes, but the direct link is not established on this page. The emphasis
    is on identifying relationships and dependencies.
  3: The paper focuses on the relationship between climate and crop yields at both
    local and global scales, and how this affects food security and trade. It highlights
    the complexity of separating the influence of climate on crops from other variables
    due to spatial and inter-annual variability.
  5: Detrended yield values are from 1964-2010. PDSI and other climatic variables
    are from 1963 to 2010, to allow for a one-year lag in association between PCs
    and climatic variables.
  8: The S matrix contains zeros because large yield spikes do not happen frequently
    across global countries. The loading values of the first three PCs approximately
    fit a normal density distribution.
  13: The study identifies specific regions and crops most vulnerable to different
    types of climate variability.
  14: The paper identifies major crop exporters (ME) and major importers (MI) and
    notes which countries co-vary conversely in different PCs. The focus appears to
    be on the interconnectedness of crop yields between exporting and importing nations
    due to climate variability. The image provides a breakdown of the influence of
    various climate indices (ATa and PDSI) via Principal Components on specific crop
    yields in various regions and lead/lag times, however no actual data is available.
  23: The study acknowledges limitations due to the coarse nature of country-scale
    crop yield datasets and the use of cropland coverage from the year 2000.
  24: The study acknowledges that its findings on cropland coverage and impacted areas
    might not be entirely accurate due to changes in cropland coverage, especially
    in countries like Brazil. The study focuses only on climate and does not separate
    the impacts of other factors influencing crop yield. The temporal scope is related
    to forecasting long range climate patterns.
