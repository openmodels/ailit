Drivers of Risk:
  1: Shocks in GDP due to climate change impacts.
  2: Shocks or changes impacting the outcomes include climate change shocks to GDP,
    economic growth model variables, investment returns, health effects, and adaptation
    processes.
  3: Climate change impacts (specifically, their effects on productivity); General
    shocks to GDP.
  4: Climate change, structural breaks in GDP series, shocks (oil price shock of 1973,
    the 1980s debt crisis, and the disintegration of the USSR in the 1990s), large-scale
    discontinuity in the climate system, rate of climate change
  5: Sea level rise, global temperature increase
  7: Climate change impacts under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios, with different
    levels of persistence parameter 'a'.
  8: Direct and indirect impacts of climate change, persistence of economic shocks,
    temperature increases, climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5).
  9: Climate change impacts under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios
  10: Climate change impacts treated as direct shocks to GDP; large persistence of
    shocks is ignored or underestimated in most projections.
  11: Climate change, natural disasters.
Highlights:
  1: Potential larger losses from climate change than previously estimated due to
    persistence of shocks.
  2: Macroeconomic impacts of climate change can be persistent due to various factors,
    and adaptation measures can alter these impacts. The interaction between climate
    and economic dynamics is crucial.
  3: Climate change impacts could be highly persistent and lead to higher cost estimates;
    Economic impacts of climate change are highly sensitive to different levels of
    persistence; Costs of climate change presented in the literature could be seriously
    underestimated.
  4: Structural breaks in GDP data significantly affect the persistence of shocks
    and the estimated economic impacts of climate change. The persistence of shocks
    assumed in some Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) is not supported by the observed
    data.
  5: Sea level rise has a permanent effect on GDP level. Climate change damages are
    included for agriculture, sea level rise, other market sectors, human health,
    nonmarket amenity impacts, human settlements and ecosystems, and catastrophes.
  7: Estimates suggest significant regional variations in economic impacts under different
    scenarios; impacts are expressed as multiples of 2001 GDP, highlighting varying
    regional vulnerability and potential costs of inaction.
  8: Estimated economic impacts are highly sensitive to the persistence of GDP shocks;
    assuming higher persistence results in significantly larger losses.
  9: IAMs often implicitly assume a lack of persistence in climate shocks, which needs
    to be made explicit. The exact level of persistence and dynamics of climate change
    impacts are unknown.
  10: Estimates of climate change costs are highly sensitive to the inclusion of a
    memory parameter, which can significantly alter projections.
Methodology:
  1: Analyzing persistence of generic shocks in observed GDP series for different
    world regions and comparing it to IAMs; investigating implications for growth
    under two RCP scenarios.
  2: The analysis is performed using Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) to study
    the persistence of impacts through various approaches like impulse response functions.
  3: Empirical approach based on econometrics literature; Augmented Dickey-Fuller
    (ADF) test for unit roots; Analysis of the persistence of shocks to GDP for 12
    groups of countries using data from the Maddison database (1950-2008).
  4: Unit root tests (Kim and Perron), Perron and Yabu procedure for structural change,
    Autoregressive models (AR(p) and AR(1)), Integrated Assessment Models (PAGE, FUND,
    DICE)
  5: Uses the DICE (Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy) model, a Solow growth model
    with a Cobb-Douglas production function. Equations provided define the relationships.
    The DICE model damage function is specified.  The model considers both equilibrium
    and disequilibrium dynamics.
  7: Utilizes impact functions with varying persistence parameters in IAMs to estimate
    economic impacts from climate change scenarios; the methodology involves projecting
    GDP impacts across different levels of shock persistence.
  8: Analysis uses the PAGE2002 model with simulations of 5000 realizations, incorporating
    the persistence of climate shocks with various parameters.
  9: Uses Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) to model climate change impacts as an
    aggregated direct shock to baseline GDP.
  10: The analysis includes simulations with various persistence values of climate
    shocks using different assumptions for memory parameters.
  11: Integrated assessment modeling, econometric analysis of macroeconomic time series,
    cost-benefit analysis.
More Notes:
  2: IAMs typically represent the effects of climate change as direct shocks to GDP,
    with differing impacts on long-term economic growth depending on the treatment
    of temporal dynamics.
  3: The analysis assumes climate change shocks would have a persistence level similar
    to general shocks to GDP, which is uncertain.
  4: The page discusses the persistence of climate change shocks in GDP and in integrated
    assessment models (IAMs) like PAGE, FUND, and DICE. The FUND model has persistence
    from the dynamic specification of its agricultural and sea level rise impact modules.
  5: The impact module of DICE/RICE has zero persistence as any shock at time t has
    no impact at time t + s for s > 0, however, the model dynamics impart a certain
    level of persistence to shocks in GDP.
  8: Regional differences in the impacts of climate change are significant and vary
    based on the persistence of shocks and adaptation measures.
  9: The parameter 'a' is relevant to how the impacts on GDP are calculated. The authors
    highlight the extreme assumption of 'zero persistence' in some IAMs, which implies
    autonomous, large, effective, costless reactive adaptation and limitless resilience
    capacities.
  11: Mentions various models and studies related to climate change economics and
    macroeconomics, including DICE model and studies on the macroeconomic consequences
    of disasters.

Quantitative material:
  3: Estimates of autoregressive coefficients (ranging from 0.87 to 0.97); Half-life
    of shocks (ranging from 5 to 23 years); Cumulative impulse response (CIR) values
    (ranging from 7.63 to 32.26).
  4: SAR estimates range from 0.46 to 0.90 with a mean of 0.70 when structural breaks
    are accounted for.  A unit shock in Western Europe would produce a CIR of 25.57
    without accounting for the break, but only 1.85 when accounting for the trend
    break. The CIR values range from 1.85 to 23.81, with a mean of 5.87.

    (Eq. 6), Capital accumulation (Eq. 7), Population (Eq. 8), Growth of population
    (Eq. 9), Total Factor Productivity (Eq. 10), Growth of Total Factor Productivity
    (Eq. 11)
  7: Quantitative estimates of impacts across regions as multiples of GDP for 2001,
    under various scenarios, persistence levels, and using net present value (NPV).
  8: Estimates show mean economic impacts of climate change ranging from 1.28% to
    12.49% of initial GDP with different parameters.
  9: Figure 2 shows impacts as percent of GDP for different values of parameter 'a'
    (with mean, 5th, and 95th percentiles). Figure 3 shows estimates of global and
    regional climate change impacts under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios
    and for different values of 'a'.
  10: Estimates are sensitive to a memory parameter; varying values of persistence
    are used to demonstrate differences in the present value of climate change costs.
