    \U0001D450\U0001D461) based on maximum wind speeds affecting each county during\
    \ storms, relative to the sample maximum. The index also considers tropical storms."

Highlights:
  1: There is substantial heterogeneity in employment responses across industries
    after hurricanes, influenced by input-output linkages.
  2: Heterogeneous effects across industries; 'strengthened industries' like construction
    experience employment increases, while 'weakened industries' like accommodation
    see decreases.
  3: Focuses on a different geographic area (Puerto Rico) than previous studies, uses
    a continuous measure of storm exposure instead of categorical measures, and examines
    employment adjustments across detailed industry classifications.
  4: Hurricane Jeanne mostly hit the western part of Puerto Rico, while hurricanes
    Irene and Maria hit the eastern part of the island much more severely. Hurricane
    Georges mostly hit the central part of the island. There is substantial variation
    in hurricane exposures both across counties and over time.
  6: The study evaluates disaster shock exposure at the county level, highlighting
    the difficulties of zeros in the data due to non-disclosure.
  7: Hurricanes cause a temporary decline in average employment. The effects are heterogeneous
    across industries, with some industries experiencing increased employment (strengthened)
    and others experiencing decreased employment (weakened).
  9: Some industries (e.g., Truck transportation, Support activities for transportation)
    show positive employment effects, while others are neutral (e.g., Air transportation,
    Water transportation) or weakened (e.g., Transit and ground passenger transportation,
    Scenic and sightseeing transportation) after a hurricane. The specific classification
    (S, N, or W) is provided in the appendix for multiple time horizons.
  10: Hurricanes have a differential impact on employment across industries. There
    is a construction boom following disasters, which can trigger increases in employment
    in industries that supply the construction sector. The relationship between the
    construction sectors and buyer outputs are starkly positive and statistically
    significant, with an R2 of 0.61.
  11: Industries such as crop production and animal production are listed among weakened
    industries, while construction of buildings and specialty trade contractors are
    among strengthened industries.
  12: Natural disasters lead to an average decline in employment, but there's extensive
    heterogeneity at the industry level. Some industries contract, while others expand
    following natural disasters. Input-output linkages explain part of this heterogeneity.
    The paper introduces the concept of adaptability-driven employment resilience,
    defined as the potential for workers to reallocate from contracting to expanding
    industries after a natural disaster.
  14: Presents industry results for selected Transport Industries regarding employment
    effects of hurricanes.
  15: The table highlights the wide range of impacts associated with hurricanes, including
    number of people affected, fatalities, and financial damages. Hurricane Maria
    (2017) had the largest damages with $71,798,241,000 and 64 fatalities reported.
  20: Panel results including zeros are presented, showing dynamic effects of hurricanes
    on employment and average weekly wages at different horizons.
  21: The table presents a classification of industries (identified by NAICS code)
    according to their sensitivity to winter or summer climate conditions at different
    time horizons, as determined by four different methods. Some industries like crop
    production (111) and animal production (112) are classified as being sensitive
    to winter and summer weather across all methods and time horizons. Other industries
    exhibit varying sensitivities depending on the method and time horizon.

    county-time and county-industry-time variations.

    industry-time variation

    horizons, considering county-time and county-industry-time variations.

    industries.

  28: Industry results with industry-specific exposure measure.
  29: Dynamic effects of hurricanes at time t on employment, average weekly wages,
    unemployed and labor force at different horizons
Methodology:
  1: The analysis uses high-frequency, geo-coded monthly data for 70 3-digit NAICS
    industries and 78 Puerto Rican counties, with panel local projections.
  2: Uses local projections to regress cumulative change in variables (like employment)
    on disaster shock variable, controlling for pre-trends and seasonal effects.
  3: Uses local projections to examine the economic impacts of hurricanes, and constructs
    a continuous treatment measure of wind exposure using satellite data and the HURRECON
    model. The analysis considers all counties in Puerto Rico and all hurricanes over
    the sample period (1995-2017).
  4: "The study constructs a population-weighted centroid for each county to calculate\
    \ maximum wind speed exposure. It uses an exposure index (\U0001D446\U0001D450\
    \U0001D461) calculated using a formula that considers the maximum wind speed relative\
    \ to the sample maximum and normalized between zero and one. The paper uses employment\
    \ data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) by the Bureau\
    \ of Labor Statistics of the United States (BLS). It also uses Local Area Unemployment\
    \ Statistics from the BLS. The paper intends to explore dynamic employment effects\
    \ using local projections."
  5: The paper uses local projections (Eq. 2 and 3) to estimate the impact of hurricane
    exposure on various economic outcomes. It controls for past values of the outcome,
    time fixed effects, and county fixed effects, and in some specifications also
    includes county-industry and industry-time fixed effects. The sample period runs
    from 1995M1 to 2019M11.
  6: A linear interpolation is applied to 8% of industry-county-time employment and
    wage observations to address non-disclosure due to anonymity.
  7: "Panel regressions (Eq. 4) at the industry level, using Newey-West corrected\
    \ standard errors. Analyzes monthly employment data for various industries, relating\
    \ changes in employment (\u0394\U0001D44B\U0001D456,\U0001D461+\U0001D458) to\
    \ an aggregate measure of disaster exposure (\U0001D446\U0001D461) at time t,\
    \ controlling for pre-trends and seasonal effects. Horizon k ranges from 0 to\
    \ 24 months."
  9: Exploits industry-time variation to assess dynamic employment effects of hurricanes.
  10: The paper uses local projections to analyze the employment response to hurricanes,
    with robustness checks using different measures of exposure to natural disasters
    and different specifications of the local projection. The results regarding construction
    employment apply to the year following a disaster.
  12: "Uses monthly data for 70 3-digit NAICS industries and 78 Puerto Rican counties\
    \ over the period 1995\u20132019. Employs local projections to capture the effect\
    \ of hurricanes. Controls for past values and leads of the measure of exposure\
    \ to account for subsequent hurricanes."
  13: The HURRECON model is used to describe sustained wind velocity within a hurricane's
    vortex. The parameters of the HURRECON model are adapted from Holland's equation
    for the cyclostrophic wind and set following Boose et al. (2004), which parameterized
    and validated the model for Puerto Rico. The paper analyzes the effect of hurricanes
    on Puerto Rico's employment and labor force.
  14: Exploits industry-time variation to assess dynamic effects of hurricanes on
    employment.
  15: The data comes from the EM-DAT database. The table lists hurricanes from 1995
    to 2017.

    \ and industry*time fixed effects, both with and without linear interpolation."
  22: "The study exploits county\u2013time and county\u2013industry\u2013time variations\
    \ to analyze the dynamic effects of hurricanes, with and without linear interpolation."

    time variation to assess the dynamic effects of hurricanes on employment at different\
    \ horizons. The results are applicable for the period 1995-2017."
