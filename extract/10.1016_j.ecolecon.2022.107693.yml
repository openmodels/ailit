Drivers of Risk:
  1: Hurricanes
  2: Hurricanes measured by maximum wind speed; potential reallocation of workers
    across industries post-disaster.
  4: Exposure to hurricanes and tropical storms, measured by a constructed index (Sct)
    based on maximum windspeed in each county relative to the sample maximum.
  5: "Disaster shocks, measured by a 'storm index' (\U0001D446\U0001D450\U0001D461\
    ) varying at the county level for each month."
  7: Hurricane shocks (disasters)
  8: Natural disasters (specifically hurricanes).
  9: Hurricanes (average hurricane with a value of 0.084).
  10: Hurricanes and natural disasters affecting industries such as manufacturing,
    transport, and construction.
  11: The analysis considers an unspecified shock/change that impacts industries,
    categorized as 'Strengthened', 'Neutral', or 'Weakened'.
  12: Natural disasters, specifically hurricanes.
  13: Hurricanes, lack of skilled workers for reconstruction efforts.
  14: Hurricanes.
  15: Hurricanes of varying categories (Tropical Storm to Category 5) based on the
    Saffir-Simpson wind scale.
  19: Hurricanes.
  20: Hurricanes at time t
  22: Hurricanes at different thresholds, specifically 64-knots, impact employment
    and wages.
  23: Hurricanes at time *t*.

Highlights:
  1: After the 'average' hurricane, employment falls by 0.5% on average.
  2: Employment declines in the 'average' hurricane while certain industries like
    construction experience employment increases, whereas others like accommodation
    see declines.
  4: There is substantial variation in hurricane exposures both across counties and
    over time in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rican economy is structured with a large
    proportion of private sector workers.
  5: The approach allows exploration of variation at the county-time level, county-industry-time
    level, and industry-time level.
  7: Hurricane shocks have a statistically significant, though temporary, negative
    impact on overall employment, with effects peaking six months after the event;
    Impacts vary significantly across industries; Construction, furniture manufacturing,
    and administrative/support services experience employment increases after hurricanes;
    Crop production, some retail sectors, and tourism-related industries experience
    employment declines.
  8: The heterogeneity in the employment response to natural disasters can be found
    even within 2-digits sectors (e.g., Transportation).
  9: Natural disasters have heterogeneous employment effects across different industries;
    some industries experience increased employment (e.g., construction), while others
    experience decreased employment or remain neutral.
  10: Construction sector sees positive employment effects post-disaster, suggesting
    input-output linkages as a transmission mechanism for disaster shocks; lack of
    impact in many manufacturing sectors.
  11: The table highlights industries that are either strengthened, remain neutral,
    or are weakened by the shock/change, providing a classification (S, N, W) for
    each.
  12: Natural disasters cause an average decline in employment, but this masks heterogeneity
    at the industry level; Input-output linkages partly explain the heterogeneity;
    Some industries contract while others expand following natural disasters; Adaptability-driven
    employment resilience, defined as the potential opportunity for workers to reallocate
    from contracting to expanding industries, is a new potential concept of resilience.
  13: Adaptability-driven employment resilience could be an important building block
    of post-disaster resilience, achievable by introducing new vocational training
    programs to endow workers with skills needed for quick reallocations across different
    industries.
  14: Hurricanes impact employment in the transport industries.

Methodology:
  1: "Panel local projections using monthly data for 70 3-digits NAICS industries\
    \ and 78 Puerto Rican counties over the period 1995\u20132019. Exogenous measure\
    \ of exposure is the maximum wind speed recorded in each county during each hurricane."
  2: Local projections using a sequence of regressions for different prediction horizons
    to analyze the dynamic employment effects.
  4: Local projections are used to explore the dynamic employment effects of hurricane
    exposure. A hurricane exposure index is constructed based on windspeeds. The index
    is normalized and incorporates a cubic power to account for wind force. The analysis
    uses employment data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW)
    from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and Local Area Unemployment Statistics.
  5: 'Local projections are used to estimate the average response of outcomes to disaster
    shocks. Two specifications are employed: one at the county-time level (Eq. 2)
    and another at the county-industry-time level (Eq. 3). The analysis controls for
    past values of the outcome variable, time fixed effects, and county fixed effects
    (and industry-time and county-industry fixed effects in the second specification).'
  7: Panel regressions and industry-level regressions are performed to analyze the
    impact of hurricane shocks on employment and wages at monthly and quarterly frequencies
    over a two year horizon; Newey-West corrected standard errors used in industry-level
    regressions
  8: Dynamic effects of hurricanes on employment-related variables are analyzed using
    county-time and county-industry-time variation. Impulse Response Functions (IRFs)
    are generated to show the effects at different time horizons.
  9: Industry-time variation is exploited to analyze the dynamic effects of hurricanes
    on employment at different horizons. The analysis considers 70 industries, with
    results applicable to the period 1995-2019.
  10: Analysis involves checking employment responses across detailed industries using
    input-output linkages and robustness checks with different measures and specifications.
  11: The analysis uses a methodology to estimate the impact on various industries
    over a 12-month horizon, resulting in a coefficient and a corresponding standard
    error for each industry.
  12: "The paper uses monthly data for 70 3-digits NAICS industries and 78 Puerto\
    \ Rican counties over the period 1995\u20132019 to study short-run, dynamic employment\
    \ effects of natural disasters using local projections."
  13: "The paper uses the HURRECON model to describe sustained wind velocity at any\
    \ point within a hurricane's vortex. Adapted from Holland\u2019s equation for\
    \ the cyclostrophic wind. The model is parameterized and validated for Puerto\
    \ Rico. The paper classifies NAICS industries into Strengthened, Neutral, or Weakened\
    \ categories for different time horizons (3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months)."
