Drivers of Risk:
  6: "Climate change is increasing the frequency or severity of fire weather, fire-season\
    \ length, burned area and fire occurrence globally; factors like vegetation changes\
    \ related to agriculture or invasive species; lightning ignitions are increasing;\
    \ deforestation; drought cycles such as El Ni\xF1o\u2013Southern Oscillation."
  10: Anthropocene fire regimes on fire-prone landscapes; Flammable landscapes and
    the wildland-urban interface; Accumulation of fuel in vegetation
  11: Potential risks associated with biomass smoke pollution from prescribed burning
    and wildfires, urban planning and policy failures, and socio-ecological factors
    in the wildland-urban interface (WUI).
  12: Increased fire risk due to changing climate and land-use patterns, including
    uncontrolled extreme fire events and deforestation fires.
  13: Anthropogenic fire regimes are influenced by human activity.
Highlights:
  6: There is general agreement that the frequency or severity of fire weather, fire-season
    length, burned area and fire occurrence are increasing with future climate change,
    but notes that there is substantial uncertainty.
  10: Sustainable fire management demands careful fuel management to conserve biodiversity,
    sustain ecosystem services, and reduce the risk of wildfire disasters.
  11: Fire management should integrate indigenous and local knowledge with mainstream
    practices; government regulation can stimulate innovation in managing smoke pollution;
    the WUI poses significant fire management challenges due to urban growth and poor
    planning.
  12: Fire management needs transdisciplinary research to develop effective strategies
    and requires nationally and internationally coordinated efforts.
  13: Wildfire management and adaptation cannot be evidence-based or cost-effective
    without strategic investment in training, capacity building, research and development,
    and evaluation of mitigation and adaptation strategies.
Methodology:
  6: The page reviews and summarizes research on projected changes in fire activity
    by geographical region using papers published since the IPCC Fifth Assessment
    Report, augmented with additional key papers. Approaches used to model future
    changes in global fire activity range from process-based coupled Earth System
    Models to statistical approaches.
  10: Adaptation and management approaches must be tailored to specific environmental
    and socio-ecological settings
  11: The analysis discusses combining traditional ecological knowledge with modern
    fire management strategies but does not detail specific methodologies or metrics.
  12: No relevant information
  13: Economic models are essential to inform investment in sustainable fire management
    and understanding the full costs of fire disasters.
More Notes:
  6: Simple attribution of increases in fire events to climate change is challenging
    because there are specific factors, including anthropogenic ones, that shape regional
    fire activity. The need to consider and to record more indices than simply area
    burned is highlighted.
  10: The intensity of fire management changes proportionally with human population
    and economic assets.
  11: The page highlights the necessity of reform in urban planning to address fire
    management in the WUI and the use of technology like smartphone apps to manage
    fire risk.
  12: Reducing accidental ignitions and managing fire regimes is necessary for preventing
    extensive fire development, preserving carbon storage, and reducing greenhouse
    gas emissions.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  6: Economically destructive fire events are increasing.
  10: Reduction of wildfire disasters; Sustaining ecosystem services (provision of
    water and clean air); Conserving biodiversity
  11: None specific to macroeconomic outcomes or fiscal measures are explicitly mentioned
    on this page.
  12: No relevant information
  13: Understanding the full costs of fire disasters, including human health impacts.
Quantitative material:
  11: "The 2019\u20132020 Australian bushfires reportedly resulted in 417 deaths and\
    \ several thousand hospitalizations due to smoke pollution, significantly highlighting\
    \ the health costs."
  12: No relevant information
  13: A global database (similar in form to the Global Fire Atlas) on the economic
    costs of wildfire management and economics losses from fire disasters is required,
    as, presently, these data are only available for a few regions.
