Drivers of Risk:
  1: Anthropogenic climate change and changes in human activities are impacting fire
    regimes.
  2: Anthropogenic climate change altering precipitation patterns and increasing temperatures,
    resulting in more frequent extreme vegetation-fire events.
  3: Reduced solar radiation; air pollution/increased aerosols; black carbon deposition;
    topography controls severity; localized rainfall; post-fire debris flow; permafrost
    thaw/loss; pyric herbivory; Indigenous burning; nitrogen deposition; phosphorus
    deposition; sediment deposition; heat fracture; soil erosion; algal blooms; altered
    soil colour/albedo; evolutionary adaptation/epicormic resprouts; evolutionary
    adaptation/basal resprouts; post-fire flooding; drought and fuel dryness.
  4: The interplay of biomass, climate, human, and natural ignitions as factors controlling
    fire activity and regimes is discussed.
  6: "Anthropogenic climate change, vegetation changes related to agriculture or invasive\
    \ species, deforestation, drought cycles (El Ni\xF1o-Southern Oscillation), lengthening\
    \ fire seasons, increased lightning ignitions, human-settlement patterns and land\
    \ use."
  7: The table highlights climate change as a driver, specifically referencing increases
    in Fire Weather Index days, global mean temperatures exceeding thresholds, and
    other changes impacting fire regimes.
  9: Climate change (worsening fire weather, drought), anthropogenic factors (logging,
    deforestation, fire suppression, ignitions), elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations,
    vegetation changes (abundance of plants with low flammability, grass/woody plant
    balance).
  11: Shrinking safe weather windows for prescribed burning due to climate change;
    Extreme fire weather reducing the effectiveness of prescribed burning; Expansion
    of the wildland-urban interface (WUI) due to growing urban populations; Socio-ecological
    factors amplifying fire risk in the WUI (e.g., human ignitions, ineffective fuel
    treatments, poor planning).
  12: Changing climate and land-use patterns are drivers of increased fire risk. Deforestation,
    accidental human ignitions, and past fire and logging disturbances are also listed
    as drivers.
  13: Climate change and numerous other anthropogenic effects on fire regimes present
    a new, urgent challenge.
  14: Climate change, human action, invasive annual grasses, lightning, fuel dynamics,
    and socioecological transitions are listed as drivers of wildfire risk.
Evaluation overview:
  1: This paper provides an overview of how vegetation fires can cause economic losses,
    severe air pollution, human mortality, and environmental damage.
  2: Economically disastrous fires due to human settlement and infrastructure embedded
    in flammable vegetation.
  3: Impacts on biosphere (vegetation cover), geosphere (soil erosion), hydrosphere
    (fluvial sediment and nutrient transport), cryosphere (soot fallout and changed
    albedo) and atmosphere (smoke pollution).
  4: No description of evaluation outcomes such as mortality or productivity loss
    is directly provided on this page.
  6: The page evaluates changes in fire regimes globally.
  7: The table summarizes projected changes in fire indicators such as fire activity,
    burned area, fire weather, and fire impacts.
  9: The page evaluates future fire regimes and their impacts on ecosystems, carbon
    storage, and greenhouse gas emissions.
  11: Mentions death and hospitalization from smoke pollution related to prescribed
    burning, potentially exceeding impacts of wildfires mitigated by the burning.
  12: The flammability of many landscapes is increasing due to the combined effects
    of changing climate and land-use patterns. Increased risk of economically and
    ecologically destructive fires is mentioned.
  13: Understanding the full costs of fire disasters, including human health impacts,
    and adverse economic and environmental impacts of fire disasters.
  14: Several papers address wildfire as the outcome being evaluated.
Highlights:
  1: The economic and environmental impacts of vegetation fires are likely to worsen
    due to anthropogenic climate change, particularly in flammable forests, boreal
    zones, and fire-sensitive tropical rainforests.
  2: Large and frequent fires in boreal and tropical forests have the potential to
    cause terrestrial carbon stores to become major greenhouse gas sources, amplifying
    climate change.
  3: Extreme fire events are characterized by anomalous fire behavior, massive emission
    of smoke and greenhouse gas pollution, prolonged duration of fires, enormous geographical
    scale of burned areas, or both; fires causing unusually adverse biological, atmospheric
    or geomorphological effects.
  4: Increases in fire frequency and extent in the boreal forest linked to higher
    temperatures and drier fuels.
  6: Frequency/severity of fire weather, fire-season length, burned area and fire
    occurrence are increasing globally with future climate change. Regions with substantial
    human influence might see no change or decreases in fire activity, but no widespread
    decrease in fire risk is expected. The number of lightning-ignited fires and burned
    area has sharply increased in Tasmania.
  7: The table highlights that increased fire weather and fire activity is projected
    in many regions, though some regions may see mixed results. North America and
    Mediterranean Europe are highlighted as regions with many studies focused on fire
    regimes.
  9: Ecosystems on the fringe of bioclimatic niches or in climate/fire refugia are
    particularly vulnerable to transformative fire regimes. Landscape-wide conversions
    from forests to grasslands/shrublands are possible, depleting soil carbon. Extreme
    fire events (black swan events) are challenging to predict.
  11: Smoke from prescribed burning can have significant human health impacts; Management
    of the WUI is crucial for mitigating wildfire risk and associated air pollution;
    Technological innovation, such as smartphone apps, can help individuals manage
    wildfire and smoke exposure.
  12: Managed fire regimes can mitigate non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation
    fires release carbon stored in vegetation and soil. Boreal forest fires emit greenhouse
    gases and create smoke. Large-scale reforestation must have effective fire management
    due to vulnerability of young trees to fires. Extreme fire behavior such as pyro-tornadoes
    are increasingly common.
  13: Coordinated transdisciplinary research can lead to the development of fire-
    management strategies and avoid adverse economic and environmental impacts of
    fire disasters... Achieving sustainable stewardship of fire regimes requires acknowledging
    that fire is an inherent feature of the Earth system that has long been modified
    by humans.
  14: The included literature highlights the increasing wildfire activity, the role
    of climate change in driving wildfires, and the impacts of wildfires on ecosystems
    and human populations.
Methodology:
  4: Relies on synthesized knowledge from existing sources and regional case studies,
    especially for the western USA and boreal Canada.
  7: "The table summarizes studies that used various methodologies (not detailed here)\
    \ to project future changes in fire indicators under climate change scenarios.\
    \ The results for the Fire Weather Index are applicable to global mean temperatures\
    \ 2 \xB0C above pre- industrial levels versus 1981\u20132010."
  9: The analysis relies on regional-scale models of fire activity, which are considered
    more accurate than global models due to better representation of biophysical and
    socio-ecological controls. Models struggle with non-analogue, rapidly changing
    future climates.
  11: Discussion of prescribed burning as a fire management strategy, including its
    limitations under changing climate conditions; Discussion of using indigenous
    and local knowledge in fire management; Discussion of fire-hardening homes, creating
    fuel breaks, and using smartphone apps to communicate fire and smoke risks.
  13: "Economic models are essential to informing investment in sustainable fire management...\
    \ Anthropological research into \u2018fire cultures\u2019 can improve our understanding\
    \ of human relationships with fire use... Risk and disaster sciences are similarly\
    \ important... Studies of the impacts and effectiveness of firefighting and emergency\
    \ management responses to major unprecedented fire events"
  14: The papers utilize a variety of methods including remote sensing, statistical
    analysis, and modeling to study fire regimes, burned area, and the impacts of
    fire.
More Notes:
  1: The paper emphasizes the importance of effective fire management, incorporating
    indigenous and local knowledge to mitigate the impacts of increased fire activity.
  2: Detecting and predicting changes in fire activity is difficult due to relatively
    brief fire records, bioregional variability and human involvement.
  3: The paper emphasizes the importance of regional-scale variation, climate change
    and anthropogenic drivers.
  4: The page provides context about regional trends in fire activity, particularly
    in the western USA and Canada, but does not include newly generated data.
  7: Some studies are marked with 'a', indicating they are from Jones et al.223 or
    other studies discussed in the text. The table summarizes the median change calculated
    from 17 climate models.
  13: There is a considerable need for data collection to improve quantification and
    modeling of fire activity and human populations, including their socio-economic
    status and historical and cultural-political legacies.
  14: The list of references covers a wide range of topics related to wildfire, including
    its drivers, impacts, and management.

Quantitative material:
  2: Global mean carbon emissions due to fire were approximately 2.2 Pg per year from
    1997 to 2016, about 22% of contemporary global annual carbon emissions from fossil
    fuel combustion.
  3: From 1979 to 2013, an average increase of 18.7% in fire-weather-season length
    has been documented across global burnable lands. Between 1998 and 2015, the area
    burned by vegetation fires globally declined by around 25%, from over 500 Mha
    to less than 400 Mha annually.
  4: No direct quantitative changes specific to the analysis are presented; largely
    descriptive and reliant on referenced studies.
  7: "The table includes quantitative projections for specific regions, such as a\
    \ +23.5 (129%) change in Fire Weather Index days in Europe - Mediterranean and\
    \ +15.5 (84.9%) in South America - Amazon. It also mentions a doubling of burned\
    \ area in the boreal zone of Canada, increasing to 5 Mha year\u22121."
  9: 'The figure (Fig. 5) presents conceptual quantitative relationships: Conversion
    of infrequently burned forest to a frequently burned, treeless state is associated
    with declines in carbon storage and increases in annual global fire-induced emissions.'
  11: "The 2019\u20132020 Australian bushfires are thought to have caused 417 deaths\
    \ and several thousand hospitalizations for cardiovascular and respiratory problems."
  12: Application of managed fire regimes to 28,000 km2 of Eucalyptus savannah in
    Arnhem Land has been estimated to have reduced accountable non-CO2 emissions by
    37.7% relative to emissions in the decade prior to the intervention. Boreal forests
    contain between 367.3 Pg and 1,715.8 Pg of carbon, and around 0.2 Pg of carbon
    is emitted from the boreal zone annually.
  14: Several papers present quantitative information about burned area, fire emissions,
    and costs associated with wildfires.
