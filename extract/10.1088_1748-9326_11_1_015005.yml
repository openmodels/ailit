Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temporal and spatial variability of precipitation (droughts and floods), climate
    shocks, water stress.
  2: Droughts, climate variability, socio-economic changes, water scarcity, and changes
    in agricultural water productivity.
  7: Drought severity and precipitation variations impact agricultural GDP and productivity.
  9: "Extreme regional drought and climate variability; El Ni\xF1o events linked to\
    \ dry spells."
  10: Drought, inter-annual climate variability, maize yield decline.
Highlights:
  1: Regional food trade is efficient in terms of water use but may be unsustainable
    because water-productive exporters rely on increasingly stressed water resources;
    Imports from the rest of the world are important, particularly during severe droughts;
    Trade can efficiently redistribute water resources across continents in response
    to sudden gaps in food production; Opportunities exist for improved water-efficiency
    and sustainability of the region's food supply via trade.
  2: Quantifies bilateral VWT within southern Africa and with the rest of the world,
    accounting for temporal variation in agricultural water productivity and trade
    patterns.
  7: Drought negatively impacts agricultural GDP in Angola and Namibia notably; a
    significant influence of low rainfall on green VWC and agricultural GDP across
    the region.
  9: The 1991-1992 drought significantly reduced maize yields in Southern Africa.
  10: Trade can redistribute food across continents in a water-efficient way in response
    to a sudden gap in food production and water productivity. Enhanced trade openness
    allowed the region to benefit from trade during a drought. Impact of the 1991-1992
    drought is clear, but effects of other droughts and inter-annual climate variability
    are much less notable at the regional and national levels. Wetter years correspond
    to higher water productivity. Climate's impact on the agro-economy is statistically
    insignificant in most of southern Africa, except for Namibia and Angola, at annual
    scales.
Methodology:
  1: Combines global hydrological model simulations with international food trade
    data to quantify water resources embedded in international food trade in southern
    Africa and the rest of the world from 1986-2011; Analyzes the impacts of socio-economic
    changes and climate variability on agricultural trade and embedded water resources.
  2: Combines a hydrological model with historical food trade data to quantify VWT
    flows within southern Africa and with the rest of the world from 1986-2011. Uses
    state-of-the-art virtual water content (VWC) estimates and bilateral international
    food trade data for five major crops and three livestock products.
  7: Analysis based on linear regression models, panel regression with country-fixed
    effects applied to assess relationships between climate variables (PDSI, PRCP,
    VWC) and economic outcomes.
  9: "Analysis of virtual water flows and precipitation data from 1986-2011, relating\
    \ drought years to El Ni\xF1o events."
  10: "Analysis of water savings (WS) induced by food trade within southern Africa\
    \ and with the rest of the world from 1986\u20132011. Linear regressions against\
    \ agricultural GDP to determine statistically significant influence of climate.\
    \ Panel regression between agricultural GDP and the Palmer Drought Severity Index\
    \ (PDSI) and Precipitation."
More Notes:
  2: "The paper aims to quantify the impacts of socio-economic changes and climate\
    \ variability on southern Africa\u2019s water-food-trade system and provides insights\
    \ on the role of trade for climate adaptation."
  7: Paper suggests improving agricultural water productivity in wetter countries
    to optimize regional trade and resource allocation.
  10: The study examines water savings induced by food trade as a proxy for economic
    resilience during droughts. The relationship between climate and agricultural
    GDP is strongest when using panel regression. Yield and GDP impacts do not include
    nonlinear effects.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Food security, agricultural productivity.
  2: Food and water security, agricultural productivity, and efficiency of trade in
    terms of water resource use.
  7: Agricultural GDP shows weak relationships with PDSI, except Angola and Namibia
    where a decrease in GDP is significant with drought severity.
  9: Agricultural production significantly declined during the severe 1991-1992 drought.
  10: Drought's economic impact on southern Africa.
Quantitative material:
  1: Global hydrological model simulations with international food trade data from
    1986-2011; 77% freshwater withdrawals used for irrigation; 75% of total cereal
    production is maize in 2010.
  2: Analysis of virtual water trade flows (VWT) in kgwater.
  7: Significant quantitative relationships provided for GDP, VWC, and maize yield;
    for example, linear relationships with specific R2 values (e.g., R2 0.24 for Angola).
  9: "Maize yields were more than halved (2170 in 1991 to 790 kg ha\u22121 in 1992\
    \ on average in Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland)."
  10: "1992 saw 35 km3 y\u22121 of water savings due to extra-regional trade; internal\
    \ trade induced 1.5 km3 y\u22121 water savings in 1994."
