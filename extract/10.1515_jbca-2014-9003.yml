Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change impacts.
  3: Business-as-usual GHG scenario; Heat stress effects on dairy production
  5: Climate change impacts, technological limits to adaptation, implementation difficulties.
  6: Climate change impacts, technological limits of adaptation, economic constraints
    (costs and benefits of adaptation), failures to learn or poor information.
  7: Climate stressors, which include both gradual change and extreme events, are
    identified as factors impacting outcomes.
  9: Climate variables (temperature, precipitation) are identified as drivers of risk,
    particularly affecting agricultural crop yields.
  10: Increased likelihood of higher variability of daily rainfall and intense precipitation
    events.
  12: High emissions scenario RCP 8.5; climate change; sea level rise; fire; coral
    reef degradation
  13: Shocks or changes impacting outcomes include carbon fertilization, CO2 levels
    affecting plant stomata, and elevated ozone levels affecting crops.
  14: Sea level rise and storm surge are key drivers of risk impacting coastal resources
    and assets.
  15: Sea level rise, changes in hurricane activity, dynamic ice sheet melting in
    Greenland and West Antarctica, droughts, flooding, location of water relative
    to demand.
  16: Climate change impacts on water resources (runoff, drought, water stress), decreases
    in hydropower generation due to regional drying, low flow effects on ecological
    resources, flooding.
  17: Changes in water resource infrastructure capacities and operating rules, particularly
    for hydropower and flood control, are noted as key risks.
  18: Vulnerable infrastructure, climate stressors (temperature, precipitation), vector-,
    water-, and food-borne diseases, air pollution, heat waves, malnutrition.
  19: Extreme heat and cold temperatures, greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP 4.5
    and RCP 8.5), population changes
  20: The link between climate change and crime is driven by factors like rational
    decision-making amid changing costs and benefits, temperature effects on aggression,
    and increased social interaction opportunities in certain climate conditions.
  21: Rising temperatures leading to changes in heating and cooling degree-days (HDD/CDDs).
  23: Changes in sea-surface temperature, increased wildfire risk, changes in water
    temperature affecting fish populations.
  24: Gradual changes in temperature and precipitation; extreme events like droughts,
    hurricanes, storm surges, wildfires, and seasonal floods.
  25: Climate change impacts, specifically flooding, aquatic effects, storms
  27: Direct effects of climate change on economic assets, production, and indirect
    effects like coastal storms.
  28: Climate change impacts (direct costs), Water availability, Cooling water intake
    temperature, Supply volumes

    sea level rise, changes in temperature.
  31: Climate change impacts, sea level rise, extreme temperatures, hurricane surge,
    storm surge, wildfires.
  33: Sea-level rise, flooding, climate change impacts on infrastructure (bridges).
Highlights:
  1: Latest work highlights gaps in comprehensive sectoral coverage, adaptation opportunities,
    and poorly understood cross- and multi-sectoral effects.
  2: Information on economic impacts of climate change and adaptation costs/benefits
    is essential for understanding the economic benefits of mitigation policies and
    identifying priority sectors for adaptive action; Systematic information on adaptation
    costs and benefits is limited, hindering the use of benefit-cost analyses (BCAs)
    for adaptation planning.
  3: CIRA and Risky Business Project provide the first national quantitative estimates
    of economic impacts for some sectors.
  4: The paper aims to provide a review and summary of economic impact and adaptation
    results by sector for the US, and identifies key gaps and challenges for researchers
    to provide a more comprehensive picture of economic impacts and adaptation costs
    for the US.
  5: Adaptation can reduce potential impacts, but there's an optimal balance between
    adaptation costs and residual impacts. Technological limits and implementation
    challenges can constrain adaptation, adding uncertainty to impact calculations.
    Policymakers need estimates of adaptation costs, impact costs, and the relationship
    between the two.
  6: Adaptation involves trade-offs between adaptation costs and residual climate
    change impacts. Full adaptation may not always be possible due to technological,
    economic, and informational constraints. Optimal adaptation seeks to balance costs
    and benefits.
  9: The richness of US data supports sophisticated analyses of climate change impacts
    and adaptation choices.
  10: Higher GHG emissions scenarios significantly increase crop yield penalties,
    with potential mitigations through carbon fertilization.
  12: Significant potential economic losses under high emissions scenarios (RCP 8.5),
    with costs reaching hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century;
    adaptation measures can significantly reduce economic risks and even offer benefits.
    Coral reef degradation has a cost of $18 billion.
  13: Higher CO2 levels allow plant stomata to open less, reducing moisture loss;
    elevated ozone may have a substantial negative effect on crop yields.
  14: Adaptation actions are determined to be cost-effective, with significant reductions
    in damages when implemented.
  15: Sea level rise and hurricane activity pose significant economic risks to the
    US; the US may be poorly adapted to current coastal risks; climate change impacts
    on water resources are complex.
  16: Climate change is expected to significantly decrease economic welfare in some
    regions due to water resource impacts, with large variations depending on the
    climate model used. GHG mitigation has a substantial effect in reducing these
    negative impacts and increasing economic welfare.
  17: Key insights indicate substantial net gains from investing in adaptation, particularly
    in modifying and optimizing capital replacement and maintenance cycles.
  18: Infrastructure impacts are significant (estimated at $260 billion), mitigation
    is effective, and adaptation is costly but important. Health impacts are uncertain
    but potentially significant.
  19: Climate change can lead to significant increases in mortality costs, particularly
    under high emissions scenarios (RCP 8.5). The median effect of climate change
    may reduce death rates until late century under RCP 4.5, but increases under RCP
    8.5.
  20: Under RCP 8.5, climate-driven crime costs could be as significant as effects
    on commodity crop production, with direct impacts implying substantial increases
    in both violent and property crime costs by mid to late century.
  21: Rising temperatures are projected to increase electricity demand and power system
    costs in the US by 2050.
  23: Climate change has significant economic impacts on coral reefs, wildfire risk,
    and recreational fishing; Mitigation policies can generate substantial benefits.
  24: Existing economic estimates of climate change impacts in the US are increasing
    in quality and comprehensiveness but still have gaps. There needs to be a broader
    range of climate stressors, improved sectoral coverage and expanding the range
    of effect categories.
  25: Impacts across agriculture, coastal zones, commercial sectors, infrastructure
    (water resources, energy networks), and forestry.
  27: RHG-MUSE model suggests that macroeconomic effects reduce the overall cost of
    direct climate impacts, but not fully inclusive of all costs.
  28: Climate change could lead to direct costs of 0.8-3.5% of GDP, but macroeconomically
    processed, 0.8-1.9% of GDP nationwide by late-century under RCP 8.5
  30: The references highlight the economic risks of climate change in the U.S., the
    costs of adaptation, and the impacts on various sectors like agriculture and human
    health.
  31: Focus on economic costs associated with climate change in the US, including
    infrastructure damage, impacts on agriculture, increased mortality due to extreme
    temperatures, and the interplay between climate change and coastal zone development.
  33: The focus is on quantifying the economic impacts of climate change and evaluating
    the effectiveness of adaptation strategies in the U.S.

More Notes:
  2: "The paper discusses the results of the U.S. EPA\u2019s Climate Impacts and Risk\
    \ Analysis (CIRA) program and the \u201CRisky Business: The Economic Risks of\
    \ Climate Change in the US\u201D report, in the context of broader literature."
  3: The paper focuses on national-scale estimates from CIRA and the Risky Business
    initiatives and excludes other individual studies, even those at a national scale.
    The US Department of Agriculture study addresses heat stress effects on dairy
    production. The Risky Business Project aims to provide a probabilistic picture
    of economic impacts to be familiar to business leaders.
  4: The paper acknowledges the importance of multi-sectoral analysis and general
    equilibrium estimates of economic impact, referencing initiatives like Risky Business
    and the National Center for Atmospheric Research's BRACE program.
  5: The literature lacks accepted methodological tenets for impact and adaptation
    studies. The graphic representation of adaptation costs and residual impacts comes
    from IPCC AR5 WGII chapter 17.2 (Chambwera et al., 2014).
  6: The framework presented is based on Chambwera et al. (2014, figure 17.2). The
    analogy to marginal abatement cost curves for mitigation policy is mentioned.
    The IPCC WGII (2014) is cited as an attempt to lay out adaptation options.
  7: The page emphasizes principles for adaptation studies but lacks specific quantitative
    data or outcomes of interest.
  9: The paper acknowledges the difficulty in estimating the value of less tangible
    impacts like loss of charismatic species or cultural heritage, and the literature
    on impacts outside of directly affected and easily quantified sectors (like manufacturing,
    mining, tourism) is relatively thin in the US context. It also mentions the importance
    of considering factors like agricultural policies and nonmarket values.
  10: The agriculture sector shows some capacity for adaptation, but its limits are
    unclear faced with fundamental weather changes.
  12: Unclear what sectors the costs are related to apart from Fire response and coral
    reefs; analysis is from Hoandaruser et al. (2014) and is using CIRA estimates.
  13: Integration of water resource availability for irrigation is critical but not
    yet incorporated in US analyses; effects of climate change on ozone levels are
    not adequately accounted for.
  15: Analyses of sea level rise impacts are dependent on assumptions about the likelihood
    of dynamic ice sheet melting; there is a potential for underestimation of natural
    risks due to lack of strong financial signals; the Risky Business Project focuses
    on quantifying coastal property value at risk of loss, rather than impacts net
    of adaptation.
  16: The analysis focuses on the US and considers the water resource sector. The
    results are sensitive to the climate model used. The analysis does not fully reflect
    the influence of infrastructure or integrate all relevant factors.
  17: The analyses emphasize the importance of intersectoral considerations in water
    resource management and infrastructure adaptation.
  18: Infrastructure analysis lacks realistic learning and baseline road maintenance
    norms. Econometric approaches for US public infrastructure are challenging because
    it's not built to optimize revenue returns. Health impact estimates have high
    uncertainty due to lack of knowledge about increased risks and changing baseline
    conditions/demographics.
  19: CIRA focuses on quantifying mortality without valuation, while Risky Business
    values mortality using both human capital and VSL approaches. Estimates vary based
    on methodology (threshold vs. synoptic).
  21: The analysis distinguishes between the impacts of climate change and the impacts
    of mitigation activities on the energy sector.
  23: The analysis focuses on monetizing specific ecosystem effects, which may not
    represent the full range of potential economic impacts.
  25: Focus on U.S., includes consideration of direct and indirect effects, as well
    as supply chain disruptions. Considers multiple levels of analysis.
  28: Intersectoral effects, especially water-energy nexus, are important omissions.
  30: Several listed references deal with the US context, which might be useful for
    a global review, but also highlights the geographic specificity of some findings.
    The sources cover impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability across sectors.
  31: Many publications are recent (2010s), suggesting ongoing and evolving research
    in this area. The list covers a range of climate change impacts, adaptation strategies,
    and economic assessments.
  33: The page provides a list of potentially relevant articles and reports, which
    need to be investigated further to extract specific quantitative results and methodological
    details. The U.S. Global Change Research Program (2014) report is a key source
    for overall climate change impacts.

    like flooding and sea-level rise.
Quantitative material:
  3: The page mentions 'national quantitative estimates of economic impacts' for some
    sectors from both CIRA and the Risky Business Project but doesn't provide specific
    numbers.
  6: Mentions simulation studies that assess optimal adaptation using a benefit-cost
    framework (e.g., Neumann, Hudgens, Herter, & Martinich, 2010). References marginal
    adaptation cost curves developed for coastal and agricultural sectors (e.g., Ahouissoussi,
    Neumann, & Srivastava, 2014; Neumann et al. 2010 for coastal; Sutton, Srivastava,
    & Neumann, 2013 for agriculture).

    \ and \u2013$3.9 to +$24 billion by 2080\u20132099."
  14: Risky Business Project estimates $66-106 billion in coastal property below sea
    level by 2050, rising to $238-507 billion by 2100, excluding adaptation action.
  15: Sea level rise could increase storm damage by $42 billion annually; Potential
    changes in hurricane activity could increase this estimate to $108 billion annually.
  16: Net welfare effects range from an increase of $0.5 billion per year in 2050
    to decreases of $6.5 billion per year by 2100 in the primary model. Other models
    show welfare decreases from $15.0 billion to over $100 billion per year by 2100.
    GHG mitigation increases economic welfare by $3.3 billion per year in 2050 and
    $9.4 billion per year by 2100 in the preferred model, and $14.5 billion to $84
    billion per year in 2100 for alternative models. Mitigation yields an overall
    increase in welfare from flooding impacts on the order of $2.5 billion dollars
    per year by 2100.
  18: Cumulative infrastructure impacts total $260 billion (discounted at 3%), with
    $160 billion from bridges, $80 billion from roads, and $20 billion from urban
    drainage. Mitigation policy reduces these impacts by $85 billion (discounted).
    Most bridge impacts occur before 2050, most road impacts after 2050.
  19: 'CIRA study: 2,000-2,700 net additional mortalities in 2050, 7,500-12,500 by

  20: "Crime due to climate change is projected to increase by 0.6\u20132.1% for violent\
    \ crime and 0.4\u20131% for property crime by late-century under RCP 8.5, with\
    \ direct crime costs estimated to rise to $5.3\u2013$11 billion annually by 2080-2099."
  21: Electricity demand is projected to increase by 1.5-6.5% by 2050 compared to
    a scenario with today's climate; Power system costs are projected to increase
    by 1.7-8.3% (cumulative costs discounted at 3% from 2015 to 2050) to meet the
    additional electricity demand.
  23: Recreational benefits of mitigation for coral reefs in Hawaii (~$17 billion
    NPV), Florida (~$1.3 billion NPV), and Puerto Rico (~$0.4 million NPV); Avoided
    cumulative fire response costs of $7.3-$9.2 billion (discounted) due to mitigation;
    Net recreational fishing days projected to increase then decline to 2000 levels
    by 2100.
  24: Cold-water fishing losses are ~$1 billion, which declines to ~$300 million when
    gains in other types of fishing are considered.

  30: The paper mentions studies on mortality, crop yields, dairy production, and
    criminal behavior in relation to climate change, all of which could be quantified.
  31: Larsen et al. (2008) estimates future costs for Alaska public infrastructure
    at risk from climate change. Mendelsohn, Nordhaus, & Shaw (1994) quantify the
    impact of global warming on agriculture using a Ricardian analysis. Mills et al.
    (2014a) quantify climate change impacts on extreme temperature mortality. Mills
    et al. (2014b) quantify and monetize potential climate change policy impacts on
    terrestrial ecosystem carbon storage and wildfires. Neumann et al. (2014a) provide
    new economic estimates of storm surge and sea-level rise impacts, adaptation,
    and benefits of mitigation policy.
  33: Several studies are likely to contain quantitative estimates of costs, damages,
    and adaptation benefits (e.g., Wobus et al. (2014) on flood damages, Yohe et al.
    publications on sea-level rise costs). The U.S. EPA (2011) report should have
    numbers.
