Drivers of Risk:
  1: Maintaining ambition as reflected in current NDCs up to 2100 and beyond.
  2: Exploration of NDC update scenarios and proportional mitigation efforts affecting
    global mean temperature increase.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Long-term sea-level rise, intensity of the hottest day in a year (TXx), and changes
    in annual mean temperature are drivers considered.
  5: The main drivers of risk are increases in temperature, specifically the hottest
    day of the year (TXx).
  6: Projected global greenhouse gas emissions leading to global mean temperature
    increases.
  7: Key drivers of risk include insufficient ambition in emissions reductions, leading
    to substantial impacts such as sea-level rise and extreme temperatures.
  8: Changes in hot extremes (TXx) and different scenarios of GMT increase drive the
    risks.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Extreme temperature, long-term sea-level rise, and economic damages for the most
    vulnerable countries are evaluated.
  2: Projections link near-term mitigation efforts in NDC scenarios to climate impacts
    up to 2100, including sea-level rise, extreme temperatures, and economic damages.

  4: "Illustrates the implications of different temperature trajectories with additional\
    \ climate impacts for three selected pathways: the current NDC pathway as reference\
    \ (NDC), a selected gradual improvement scenario for the big emitters (CAT countries)\
    \ with a reduction in GHG emissions by 33 % (BE33) and a 1.5 \u25E6C scenario\
    \ based on SSP1-RCP1.9 (Rogelj et al., 2018b) (1.5 \u25E6C). Examines long-term\
    \ sea-level rise, extreme hot days, and economic damages."
  5: The paper evaluates changes in extreme temperature (TXx) and economic damages
    (reduction in GDP per capita) under different climate scenarios.
  6: No relevant information
  7: This page provides an overview of climate impacts like global mean sea-level
    rise and increases in maximum temperatures, and GDP reductions for Least Developed
    Countries under different mitigation scenarios.
  8: Economic damages, measured as percentage difference in GDP per capita, are evaluated
    under different global mean temperature (GMT) increase scenarios.
Highlights:
  1: Incremental improvements in reduction targets, even if achieved globally, are
    insufficient to align collective ambition with the goals of the Paris Agreement;
    A transformational increase in 2030 ambition is required to achieve the goals
    of the Paris Agreement and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
  2: "Current global mitigation targets under NDCs lead to global warming of about\
    \ 3\xB0C, falling short of the emission reductions needed to meet the Paris Agreement\
    \ goals."
  3: Incremental improvements of 2030 targets are evaluated to assess their sufficiency
    for the Paris Agreement temperature goals.
  4: Illustrates the relevance of different 2030 NDC update scenarios for long-term
    sea-level rise, extreme hot days, and economic damages.
  5: "Current NDC pledges would lead to approximately 3\xB0C of warming by 2100. Increased\
    \ ambition pathways are needed to limit warming to 1.5\xB0C or below 2\xB0C, but\
    \ smaller incremental improvements are insufficient. Scenarios limiting emissions\
    \ to big emitters only lead to higher warming levels. The importance of small\
    \ emitters' contributions increases under scenarios of more ambitious global action."
  6: "Gradual improvements of present-day NDC ambition levels are insufficient to\
    \ achieve the 1.5\xB0C limit. More ambitious mitigation targets for big emitters\
    \ have the biggest effect on GMT."
  7: "Important outcomes include that a 1.5\xB0C scenario results in significantly\
    \ lower impacts compared to current NDC pathways, highlighting the need for greater\
    \ ambition."
  8: Economic impacts on GDP per capita become more severe by 2100, especially under
    the NDC pathway, in Latin America, LDCs, SIDS, and South Asia. The fraction of
    land affected by at least a 2 degree C increase in hot extremes is also quantified.
Methodology:
  1: "The paper assesses the outcomes of different scenarios of NDC updating that\
    \ fall short of achieving the 1.5\u25E6C benchmark using scenarios of incremental\
    \ NDC improvements."
  2: Combines analysis of mitigation targets by big emitters and climate impact projections,
    focusing on incremental global NDC update scenarios for 2030.
  3: Global mean temperature trajectories are derived using the reduced complexity
    carbon cycle and climate model MAGICC6 (Meinshausen et al.,2011) using constructed
    GHG emission pathways.
  4: Uses MAGICC sea-level model for GMSLR projections from 1850 to 2300, emulating
    IPCC AR5. Analyzes extreme temperatures using a time-slicing approach based on
    CMIP5 model runs and calculates TXx change distributions. Calculates economic
    damages based on Burke et al. (2018), comparing GDP with and without climate change
    at mid-century (2046-2065) and end of century (2081-2100), using downscaling factors
    to translate GMT differences to gridded temperature changes.
  5: The study uses climate scenarios to project changes in TXx and an economic model
    to estimate damages to GDP per capita, focusing on vulnerable regions.
  6: The study analyzes different scenarios with varying levels of emission reductions
    applied to either big emitters (BE) or all countries (ALL) and projects their
    impact on global mean temperature. The scenarios are based on current Nationally
    Determined Contributions (NDCs) and incremental improvements. Applicable from
    the present day to 2100.
  7: "Results are based on scenarios comparing current NDCs, a 33% increase in ambition,\
    \ and a scenario limiting warming to 1.5\xB0C."
  8: Economic damages are estimated using different GCMs, with boxplots showing the
    25th and 75th percentiles and whiskers extending to 1.5 times the interquartile
    range. Changes in hot extremes are based on an area-weighted aggregation of all
    TXx change values projected at grid cells within a region and across climate models.
More Notes:
  2: Analysis includes impacts on sea-level rise, extreme temperatures and economic
    damages.
  3: The analysis uses a constant quantile extension method to extend emission scenarios
    until 2100.
  5: The economic damage model does not consider sea-level rise, extreme weather events,
    or other non-linear trends.
  6: "The analysis suggests profound economic risks for developing countries under\
    \ scenarios of current ambition. Median economic impacts can be halved by achieving\
    \ a 1.5\xB0C scenario (though the page doesn't contain the analysis to produce\
    \ this claim, only references it)."
  8: "The study compares a scenario based on current NDCs, a more aggressive mitigation\
    \ scenario (BE33), and a 1.5\xB0C pathway."
Quantitative material:
  1: "Reduction in the gross domestic product (GDP) in tropical countries of around\
    \ 60% compared to a no-climate-change scenario; median long-term sea-level rise\
    \ of close to 2m in 2300; increase in aggregated NDC ambition of big emitters\
    \ by 33% in 2030 does not reduce presented climate impacts by more than about\
    \ half compared to limiting warming to 1.5\u25E6C."
  2: "Current NDCs imply 52\u201358 GtCO2eq.yr\u22121 by 2030, while achieving 1.5\xB0\
    C requires levels of 25\u201330 GtCO2eq.yr\u22121."
  3: "The 2018 CAT Pledges & Targets global emission pathway (excluding international\
    \ bunkers and LULUCF) would lead a temperature increase of about 3\u25E6C in 2100."
  4: Calculates land fraction distributions of changes in the intensity of the hottest
    day in a year (TXx). Economic damages are expressed in terms of the gross domestic
    product (GDP).
  5: "Under a 1.5\xB0C scenario, 50% of the land area TXx would increase by at least\
    \ 1.1\xB0C compared to current conditions. For the BE33 scenario, half the land\
    \ area would experience an increase in TXx of at least 1.8\xB0C. Under the NDC\
    \ scenario, the global median increase of TXx is projected to be 2.7\xB0C above\
    \ the 1986-2005 level. Around 2050, estimated median reduction in GDP per capita\
    \ ranges between 11% and 14% for the 1.5\u25E6C pathway, between 14% and 17% for\
    \ the BE33 scenario, and between 17% and 20% reduction for the baseline pathway\
    \ of the current NDCs."
  6: "Projected median increase in global mean temperature for 2100 relative to 1750\
    \ under different scenarios (3.0\xB0C to 1.75\xB0C)."
  7: The paper provides quantitative projections including median global sea-level
    rise and temperature increase under various scenarios, with detailed values for
    2100 and 2300.
  8: "Provides quantitative estimates of changes in hot extremes (TXx) as land area\
    \ fraction affected and percentage difference between GDP per capita under selected\
    \ temperature pathways (no change in current NDCs, BE33 scenario resembling a\
    \ 33% change in NDCs of big emitters and a 1.5\u25E6C pathway) and GDP per capita\
    \ under a no-climate-change scenario."
