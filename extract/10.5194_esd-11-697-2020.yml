Drivers of Risk:
  1: Insufficient global mitigation ambition up to 2030, maintaining ambition as reflected
    in current NDCs up to 2100 and beyond, incremental improvements in reduction targets.
  4: "Temperature changes based on different climate pathways (current NDC, BE33,\
    \ and 1.5\xB0C scenario)."
  5: Temperature increase for various NDC ambition scenarios; particular focus on
    emissions from major emitters and scenarios with increased ambition.
  7: "Different scenarios of mitigation ambition (NDC reference scenario, 33% ambition\
    \ increase for big emitters, 1.5\xB0C scenario) leading to global mean sea-level\
    \ rise and increases in annual maximum temperature (TXx)."
Highlights:
  1: Incremental improvements in reduction targets are insufficient to align collective
    ambition with the goals of the Paris Agreement; transformational increase in 2030
    ambition is required to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and avoid the
    worst impacts of climate change.
  5: Economic damages from climate change projected for vulnerable regions like Latin
    America, South Asia, Least Developed Countries (LDCs), and Small Island Developing
    States (SIDS).
  7: "Even a 33% increase in ambition by big emitters only reduces about half the\
    \ inferred impacts (sea-level rise, extreme temperatures, economic damages) compared\
    \ to limiting warming to 1.5\xB0C."
Methodology:
  1: "Assessment of different scenarios of NDC updating that fall short of achieving\
    \ the 1.5\u25E6C benchmark using scenarios assessed by the IPCC."
  4: "Economic damages are calculated based on the methodology by Burke et al. (2018),\
    \ which combines estimates from the historical relationship between GDP growth\
    \ and temperature variability and projected future temperature changes.  Downscaling\
    \ factors are calculated for each model based on differences in annual mean temperature\
    \ between two 20-year periods (2046\u20132065 and 2081\u20132100) and a reference\
    \ period (1986\u20132005) for the three temperature pathways."
More Notes:
  1: The paper projects climate impacts under median scenarios for extreme temperature,
    long-term sea-level rise and economic damages for the most vulnerable countries.
  3: The analysis extends emission scenarios using integrated assessment models and
    emulates climate responses with the MAGICC6 model.
  6: Profound economic risks for developing countries under scenarios of current ambition.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Reduction in GDP in tropical countries of around 60% compared to a no-climate-change
    scenario under the assumption of maintaining current NDC ambition up to 2100 and
    beyond.
  4: Economic damages expressed in terms of GDP loss.
  5: Economic damages from temperature increase projected on GDP per capita for specific
    regions.
  6: "Median economic impacts can be halved by achieving a 1.5\xB0C scenario."
  7: GDP reductions for Least Developed Countries (LDCs) relative to a no-climate-change
    scenario.
Quantitative material:
  1: "A reduction in the gross domestic product (GDP) in tropical countries of around\
    \ 60% compared to a no-climate-change scenario; median long-term sea-level rise\
    \ of close to 2m in 2300; an increase in aggregated NDC ambition of big emitters\
    \ by 33% in 2030 does not reduce presented climate impacts by more than about\
    \ half compared to limiting warming to 1.5\u25E6C."
  4: "GDP is estimated at the degrees of warming reached with the current NDCs, BE33\
    \ and a 1.5\xB0C pathway and then compared to the GDP in a counterfactual scenario\
    \ without climate change. The impacts are calculated for midcentury (2046\u2013\
    2065) and end of century (2081\u20132100)."
  5: Median GDP per capita reduction by 2050 is estimated to be between 11% and 20%
    depending on the scenario; by 2100, reductions range from 29% to 50%.
  7: "Median increase in annual maximum temperature (TXx) relative to 1986\u20132005:\
    \ 2100 - NDC: +2.7\xB0C, BE33: +1.8\xB0C, 1.5\xB0C: +1.1\xB0C."
