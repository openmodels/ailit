  4: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  4: Changes in water availability (P/PET) in drylands.
  5: Continued greenhouse gas emissions leading to widespread and spatially variable
    changes in aridity (P/PET).
  6: Climate change induced degradation, changes in rainfall patterns, increasing
    drought and heat extremes, intense rainfall events, population growth, climate
    change induced migration.
Highlights:
  4: Carbon stocks in global drylands increase with increasing water availability
    (P/PET).
  5: Many dryland regions in North and South America, West and southern Africa, southern
    Europe, Central Asia and Australia will become more arid. Significant regions
    in East Africa, South and East Asia, Siberia and Alaska may experience net increases
    in water availability. Regional differences in climate change trajectories represent
    both challenges and opportunities for carbon sequestration.
  6: Climate change will differentially impact dryland regions based on changing rainfall
    patterns, projected changes in human populations, land use and use of fire.
Methodology:
  4: Analysis of data on above-ground wood and below-ground root biomass and modelled/calibrated
    estimates of average carbon in herbaceous vegetation. Soil organic carbon estimates
    are for the top 30 cm of soil.
  5: Analysis of climate change trajectories using 22 general circulation models (GCM)
    under a 'business as usual' emission scenario (RCP 8.5).
  6: Analysis of impacts of 21st Century climate change in Africa, analysis of interactions
    between climate and land use impacting different dryland regions in different
    ways.
More Notes:
  4: The analysis focuses on carbon stocks in dryland ecosystems and how they relate
    to water availability. While the study does not directly address macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes, it provides a quantitative assessment of carbon stocks, which
    could be relevant in the context of carbon sequestration and related economic
    activities (e.g., carbon markets).
  5: Climate change impacts on dryland vegetation are both indirect and direct, with
    direct effects including increases in hot extremes and meteorological droughts.
  6: Discusses climate feedbacks via albedo, surface roughness and boundary layer
    interactions. Mentions the role of land use in greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation,
    highlighting the importance of dryland vegetation and soils. Refers to the UNCCD's
    Land Degradation Neutrality goal.

  6: Climate change-induced degradation has reduced pastoral productivity in dryland
    areas of Africa, with associated reductions in livestock productivity. Climate
    change will impact land use options and, in low-income drylands, contribute to
    migration, urban expansion and conversion of drylands to cropland. Changing rainfall
    patterns could lead to decreasing or increasing vegetation production and carbon
    stocks in woody biomass.
Quantitative material:
  4: Percentage of global carbon stocks held in drylands (22.1% for Aboveground biomass,
    37.9% for Belowground biomass, 44.3% for Soil organic matter, 29.7% for All stocks).
  5: "Projected change in aridity (P/PET) for 2076\u20132100 relative to 2006\u2013\
    2025, averaged across 22 GCMs participating in CMIP5 for RCP 8.5. Aridity change\
    \ ranges from -0.1 (drier) to 0.1 (wetter)."
  6: Changing temperature, rainfall and land use patterns will have a small negative
    impact on the carbon stored in woody vegetation across the entirety of Sub-Saharan
    Africa. Climate change induced migration leading to losses of up to 60% of SOC
    stocks in dryland soils.
