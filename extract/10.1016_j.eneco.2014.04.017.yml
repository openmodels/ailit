Drivers of Risk:
  2: Changes to temperature, precipitation, and other climate measures. Hotter summers
    and warmer winters affecting energy consumption and production patterns.
  3: Climate change impacts on weather patterns, affecting heating and cooling needs;
    weather shocks; future income distribution and technologies.
  6: "Changes in the probability distribution of experiencing temperature (t) due\
    \ to climate change, shifting from F0(t) to F\u03C4(t)."
  7: Climate change impacting energy expenditures.
  8: Climate change resulting in warmer summers and warmer winters
  14: Climate change (implicitly)
  17: Changes in electricity prices, air conditioner efficiency, purchase price of
    air conditioners, cooling degree days (a measure of temperature/heat), and income.
  18: Climate change leading to increased demand for cooling; Air conditioner adoption.
  19: Climate change (warming temperatures), rising incomes, air conditioner penetration.
  29: Temperature changes
Highlights:
  2: Most studies focus on electricity consumption in the residential sector, with
    sparse coverage of the commercial and industrial sectors as well as studies on
    other fuels. There is a lack of empirical peer-reviewed economics papers on the
    effect of climate on energy supply.
  3: People adapt to climate change through both intensive (usage patterns of existing
    capital) and extensive (purchasing decisions, fuel sources, building characteristics)
    margins. Understanding both is important for policy design.
  6: Climate change alters temperature distributions, leading to changes in household
    energy expenditures and durable goods choices, impacting welfare. Panel data estimates
    are preferred for measuring these effects due to their ability to control for
    unobserved shocks.
  7: Cross-sectional data allows for observation of all consumption choices differing
    with climate and may reflect a long-run equilibrium. These estimates measure both
    intensive and extensive margins of consumption changes, but do not account for
    transition costs or potential omitted variable bias.
  8: Global warming will result in fuel switching in the United States, with more
    homes heating with electricity. American energy expenditures will likely increase.
  14: The literature examining the adoption of air conditioners in response to changes
    in climate is essentially non-existent. Air conditioner adoption in the US significantly
    increased between 1955 and 1980.
  17: Air conditioner adoption is responsive to efficiency, and room AC adoption is
    responsive to electricity prices.
  18: Better understanding of intra-European adoption patterns is very important to
    better project future electricity demand in the European Union. Data on air conditioner
    usage and adoption are scarce in Europe.
  19: Increased air conditioner penetration in Europe, driven by warming temperatures
    and rising incomes, could significantly impact electricity consumption and load
    profile, especially given shifts away from nuclear power.
  29: Displays how the estimated temperature slope coefficients vary across temperature
    bins and climate zones.
Methodology:
  2: The paper surveys the literature containing empirical papers published in peer-reviewed
    economics journals focusing on how climate affects energy expenditures and consumption.
  3: Review of literature on energy choices in different climates and consumer responses
    to weather shocks; distinction between intensive and extensive margin adjustments
    to climate change.
  6: The analysis uses a utility function framework to model household responses to
    temperature changes. It considers both changes in energy expenditures and durable
    goods holdings. It compares welfare effect measures from time series and panel
    data, finding panel data preferable.
  7: Uses cross-sectional data to compare consumption choices across different climates,
    assuming households are in long-run equilibrium. Organizes the literature review
    by the type of data used (cross-section, time series, and panel).
  8: Discrete-continuous choice model using cross-sectional data, with fuel choice
    being endogenous to climate change. A multinomial logit model is used in the first
    stage, followed by an equation of conditional demand.
  14: Review of literature on air conditioner adoption in the US, Europe, and developing
    countries.
  17: Statistical analysis of Residential Electricity Consumer Survey (RECS) data
    to estimate demand elasticities.
  18: The paper uses cross sectional US data to parameterize relationships which determine
    climate dependent saturation levels in other countries.
  29: Estimates temperature slope coefficients for temperature bins, comparing two
    binning methods and normalizing to a specific temperature range. Results are applicable
    to climate zones represented by the city names in each panel.
More Notes:
  3: The intensive margin adjustments are more understood than the extensive ones.
    Short-run policy measures to reduce weather-driven energy demand differ from long-run
    policies to control extensive margin adjustments.
  6: "The measure \u2206W excludes how climate directly enters the utility function\
    \ and therefore is only a part of the overall costs. The analysis also notes that\
    \ energy and durables prices may respond to climate change, the transition may\
    \ be costly, and the transition occurs over time requiring discounting of future\
    \ costs."
  7: The paper focuses on direct econometric papers and discusses alternative approaches
    like electricity demand estimation and engineering methods in the appendix. The
    literature review is organized by data type to highlight how data variation informs
    the estimation of intensive and extensive margins.
  8: The model uses 30-year average monthly temperature and precipitation data matched
    to household and firm Energy Information Administration survey data.
  14: The text notes the importance of weather/climate relative to other factors (policy,
    population, income, prices) in the air conditioner adoption decision.
  17: The paper cited is Rapson (2011), who estimated unit demand elasticities with
    respect to electricity price, unit efficiency and purchase price of the units.
  18: "The paper notes a lack of publicly available data and studies at member country\
    \ level for EU member countries regarding air conditioner adoption. The paper\
    \ argues that the continued growth of air conditioner penetration makes using\
    \ across section of current penetration levels as \u201Csaturation\u201D proxies\
    \ for other regions with similar climate characteristics questionable."
  19: The page suggests that collecting and analyzing data on air conditioner usage
    in Europe, similar to studies done in the US, would be insightful for understanding
    future energy demand.

  8: Warmer summers result in more electricity and oil consumption, while warmer winters
    will result in less natural gas consumption for households. Commercial firms are
    expected to increase electricity consumption and decrease oil consumption as temperatures
    increase. Overall, American energy expenditures will likely increase.
