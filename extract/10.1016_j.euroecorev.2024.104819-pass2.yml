Drivers of Risk:
  1: Region-specific temperature and damage functions, phased impact of emissions
    on global and regional temperature
  2: The model connects carbon emissions to atmospheric carbon concentration and,
    thereby, mean global temperature.
  3: Region-specific temperature increases caused by carbon emissions; specifically,
    the increase in the planet's mean surface temperature.
  6: No relevant information
  7: Fossil fuel consumption (oil, gas, coal); prices of oil, gas, and coal; the cost
    of extracting dirty energy as a function of cumulative extraction; Clean energy
    price
  8: "The equations include factors related to carbon policy such as taxes (\U0001D70F\
    \U0001D461), and lump-sum rebates (\uE240\U0001D440\U0001D461) to dirty energy\
    \ producers."
  9: Carbon emissions from human activities and land use drive changes in atmospheric
    CO2 concentration, radiative forcing, and ultimately, global and regional temperatures.
  10: "Regional surface temperatures (\U0001D447\U0001D467,\U0001D461) are the primary\
    \ driver of risk, impacting TFP through a damage function. Temperatures above\
    \ or below an optimal temperature (\U0001D447\u2217) lead to productivity losses."

  13: This page discusses regional productivity growth rates relative to US productivity
    growth.
  14: The paper provides an overview of the outcome being evaluated in terms of productivity
    losses and regional GDP impacts due to climate change.
  15: The document evaluates the peak Business As Usual (BAU) losses and gains as

    2x, 4x, and 6x).
  16: The analysis focuses on optimal initial carbon taxes and their sensitivity to
    damage functions, as well as the implications of carbon taxation on welfare and
    global/regional damages.

  35: Gas consumption is evaluated in quad Btu.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change may dramatically reduce GDP in most regions; Carbon taxation,
    coupled with region- and generation-specific transfers, can both correct the carbon
    externality and raise the welfare of all current and future agents
  2: Carbon taxation, coupled with the appropriate interregional and intergenerational
    redistribution, can substantially limit the damage while making everyone, across
    space and time, equally better off.
  3: Global carbon taxation can significantly mitigate losses from climate change,
    but atmospheric carbon concentration is already high. The optimal UWI policy limits
    peak global damages by 44.3%.
  6: No relevant information
  7: A key feature is the representation of a transition from dirty to clean energy,
    allowing for varying degrees of substitutability. The model incorporates constraints
    to prevent negative energy consumption and reflects the idea that dirty energy
    production ceases when it becomes more expensive than clean energy. Extraction
    costs of fossil fuels increase as reserves diminish.
  10: "Cold regions may initially benefit from warming as temperatures approach \U0001D447\
    \u2217, while hot regions will be harmed. Regional climate-specific TFP peaks\
    \ at \U0001D447\u2217."
  11: Lists the 18 global regions included in the model (Table 1).
  12: China's carbon emissions are twice that of the US and three times that of Western
    Europe, reflecting its overwhelming dependence on coal. US emissions are three-fifths
    larger than that of WEU.
  14: Significant potential damages under BAU; 6x damage scenario shows global peak
    damages of 17% world output, with particularly severe impacts on regions such
    as India, the US, China, and Japan/South Korea/Hong Kong by 2200.
  15: Under 6x damage, global GDP losses reach 16.7%; U.S. ends fossil fuel use by
    2105; India's GDP share increases significantly by 2100.
  16: Optimal carbon taxes are highly sensitive to damage function specification;
    UWI carbon policy achieves welfare gains for all generations in some scenarios.
  17: "Optimal carbon taxes grow at time-varying rates, accelerating after 60 years.\
    \ A simple, time-invariant growth in the carbon tax suffices to produce the vast\
    \ majority of any policy\u2019s welfare impacts. UWI makes everyone better off\
    \ but comes at a very high net tax cost to India and other low-income regions.\
    \ UWIL (capping net taxes on future generations at 10 percent) welfare gains are\
    \ uniform for all region-specific generations not subject to the limit, and higher\
    \ for those subject to the limit. Absent transfers, many early generations are\
    \ harmed by SCC-based carbon taxation."
  19: Carbon taxation can dramatically reduce regional climate damage by almost 50
    percent for almost all regions. Emissions reductions are substantial and similar
    regardless of welfare transfer schemes. Carbon taxation dramatically limits the
    increase in temperature, keeping it within or near the 2.0-degree limit set in
    the Paris Agreement.
  20: Figure 6 shows total CO2 emissions for the 6x damage specification under different
    policies as a function of years.
  21: The paper examines welfare gains as a function of years and different policies.
  22: Optimal carbon taxes can lead to a marked reduction in the consumption of fossil
    fuels, thereby yielding long-term benefits for future generations.
  23: The UWI policy would significantly impact poorer regions like India, requiring
    them to transfer a substantial portion of future consumption to service carbon-policy
    debt, raising fairness concerns.
  24: China is projected to eclipse the US economically with or without a carbon policy.
    The end of US economic hegemony is essentially independent of carbon damage and
    carbon policy. Carbon policy has a potentially significant impact on India's share
    of global GDP.
  26: The regional SCC is only significant in China and the US, despite large projected
    damages in regions like India and Brazil. Partial participation in emissions reduction
    efforts is problematic.
  27: A $100 carbon tax by all regions except China could lead to a 1.5% UWI gain,
    while a coalition of the US, WEU, GBR, JSHK, and China taxing collectively results
    in other regions increasing CO2 emissions by 43%.
  28: Absent policy, climate change can cause substantial GDP losses, particularly
    in regions like India. A compensatory carbon tax policy with region- and generation-specific
    transfers can achieve a uniform welfare gain. UWIL policy provides significant
    welfare gains while limiting taxes on future generations. Carbon taxation shortens
    the duration of fossil fuel usage and reduces global and region-specific climate
    damage.
  29: The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is high for regions with high total GDP, notably
    CHI and USA. The tax on carbon equals the SCC in optimal cases. The taxes have
    a dramatic effect on coal use.
  30: The social cost of carbon varies significantly across regions and increases
    over time, with notably high costs projected for China and substantially different
    values based on economic scenarios (BAU vs UWI).
  32: Optimal carbon tax rates are determined to maximize welfare gains and minimize
    global damages as a share of GDP.
  35: Gas consumption is shown as a function of years under different policies.
Methodology:
  1: Large-scale, annually calibrated, multi-region, overlapping generations model
    of climate change and carbon policy; region-specific temperature and damage functions;
    calibrated to the latest scientific evidence
  2: The paper develops a large-scale, multi-region, overlapping generations (OLG)
    model.
  3: The study uses a large-scale overlapping generations (OLG) integrated assessment
    model (IAM) with region-specific emissions and damages. Region-specific temperatures
    are determined using a climate-science technique called pattern scaling based
    on global average temperature.
  6: The paper uses a dynamic economic assessment model with region-specific firms
    and households to analyze climate change impacts. The model incorporates region-specific
    technologies, clean and dirty energy production, and perfect capital mobility.
    It uses a competitive equilibrium framework and a climate emulator. The model
    is calibrated using data described in Section 4 and Appendix A.1, and the solution
    procedure is detailed in Appendix A.3.
  7: The page presents a model of energy production and consumption, including clean
    and dirty energy sources. It uses cost minimization, CES production functions
    for dirty energy, and an assumption of finite energy reserves to model energy
    markets and optimal extraction paths. Applicability is dependent on the specific
    parameterization of the model (given in Section 4).
  8: This paper uses a general equilibrium model to analyze climate policy. The model
    includes dirty energy production, households, and government debt. The households
    make decisions based on mortality risk and maximize the coefficient of relative
    risk aversion. The model uses Kuhn-Tucker conditions to model dirty energy production.
  9: The model uses a multi-region overlapping generations (OLG) model and adopts
    the functional form of DICE (Nordhaus, 2017). It models the carbon cycle using
    three carbon reservoirs (atmosphere, upper ocean, lower ocean). It also uses pattern
    scaling to infer regional temperatures from global temperatures. The parameterization
    is based on Folini et al. (2024).
  10: "The paper uses pattern scaling from Lynch et al. (2017) to derive local temperatures\
    \ on a 1\xB0 by 1\xB0 grid using the CCSM4 model under the RCP8.5 scenario. Regional\
    \ average surface temperatures are computed using GDP-weighted cell-specific temperature\
    \ values. The model is solved backward from a steady state in 3017 using a Gauss-Seidel\
    \ iteration technique. The SCC is calculated by comparing damages from two emissions\
    \ paths (one with an extra unit of CO2)."
  11: An 18-region overlapping generations (OLG) model is built upon the Global Gaidar
    Model (GGM), coupled with a climate emulator. The model uses 2017 GDP values from
    the World Bank's Development Indicators to calibrate regional total factor productivity
    (TFP). Energy consumption data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA)
    is used to calibrate region-specific CES production functions. The elasticity
    of substitution between oil, coal, and gas is set to 2.
  12: "Calculates the 2017 price of gas and coal based on energy content and prices.\
    \ Normalizes the sum of dirty-energy components to 1 to construct a price of the\
    \ dirty-energy composite. Assumes one-third of the remaining output share is paid\
    \ to capital with the rest paid to labor. Uses the ratio of each region's total\
    \ energy consumption as a share of its GDP to provide a measure of 1 \u2212 \U0001D6FC\
    \U0001D467\u2212 \U0001D6FD\U0001D467. Adopts   \U0001D703= 0.13  and \U0001D711\
    \ = 0.27 , the clean-energy production parameters specified in Eq.(5), fromKotlikoff\
    \ et al.(2021). Assumes that 60 percent of clean energy output is paid to land,\
    \ with the rest distributed between labor and capital."
  13: The analysis uses univariate, country-specific regressions aggregated to generate
    regional productivity growth rates.
  14: Analysis performed using 'Krusell-Smith'-type productivity functions, considering
    different damage-function scenarios with varying productivity losses as a function
    of temperature increases.
  15: Climate outcomes calibrated using the multi-model mean of CMIP5 simulations;
    BAU scenarios compared to IPCC RCP scenarios.
  17: Simulation model with different transfer schemes (No Transfers, UWI, UWIF, UWIL)
    and a BAU scenario; examines optimal carbon taxation and its impacts on welfare
    and other economic variables.
  19: The analysis uses a carbon tax policy with and without welfare gain sharing
    to simulate the effects on emissions, temperature, and damages under 6x and 4x
    damage specifications. Results are shown for different regions, including SAP,
    BRA, SSA, MENA, ANZ, China, US, CND and RUS. Baseline year is 2017.
  20: The results are applicable from 2017 onwards.
  21: The analysis considers different policies and their impact on welfare gains
    over time, with year 0 being 2017. The x-axis references the year of birth for
    the 6x damage specification.
  22: The paper simulates the impact of different carbon tax policies on regional
    temperature.
  24: Compares regional GDP shares under BAU and optimal carbon tax policies in a
    6x damage scenario. Also considers the impact of infinite coal reserves and imperfect
    substitutability between green and dirty energy as alternative assumptions.
  28: The study uses a model to simulate the impact of climate change on regional
    GDP under a Business as Usual (BAU) scenario and under various carbon tax and
    transfer policies (UWI, UWIF, UWIL). The applicability of results is tied to the
    model's assumptions and parameters.
  29: "The paper solves a series of simple one-period problems recursively and uses\
    \ an iterative procedure to find the optimal carbon tax path, updating each period\u2019\
    s carbon tax to that period\u2019s SCC in each iteration."
  32: The analysis is performed by iterating numerical methods to determine optimal
    carbon tax policies, employing Lagrange multipliers and converging on uniform
    welfare gains.
  34: The analysis involves iteratively guessing a carbon tax path, finding an LSRA
    solution, calculating a new SCC path, and updating the tax path until convergence.
  35: The analysis is performed for a '6x damage specification' and shows results
    from 2017 (year 0) onward.
More Notes:
  1: Focus on carbon taxes and redistribution policies
  2: The model features 18 regions and 80 overlapping generations.
  3: The model handles feedbacks between global and region-specific temperatures,
    damages, production, and emissions. A UWI policy is proposed, which includes a
    carbon tax at the social cost of carbon and lump-sum redistribution.
  6: The model focuses on Pareto efficiency rather than social welfare.
  7: The paper considers dirty energy producers maximizing market value subject to
    constraints on reserve depletion. There is reference to results on the optimal
    path of carbon taxation in Section 5.3, but these results do not appear on this
    page.
  8: The equations presented on this page specify the relationships between different
    economic actors. The land rent equation (28) is the only equation relevant to
    direct climate impacts, if land is impacted by climate.
  9: The model incorporates an international institution (IMF) to coordinate global
    carbon policy and assess carbon taxes.
  11: The model splits the Canada, Australia, and New Zealand region from the Global
    Gaidar Model into Canada and ANZ (Australia plus New Zealand).
  12: Table 8 in the Appendix shows region-specific GDP, energy consumption, and CO2
    emissions relative to the USA.
  13: The scenario may be optimistic as it uses the multi-model mean from CMIP5 as
    a target, suggesting possible underestimation of temperature increases and damages.
  14: Russia and Canada could see positive impacts with potential GDP gains due to
    initial low temperatures and ensuing productivity increases with warming.
  15: Emissions in BAU scenario are lower than in DICE or RCP8.5; BAU emissions path
    is between RCP6.0 and RCP4.5 scenarios.
  16: Analysis emphasizes the challenge of ownership and distribution of natural resources
    like oil, gas, and coal, and their impact on policy calibration and effectiveness.
  17: The impact of carbon taxation is highly dependent on how the efficiency gains
    from taxing carbon are distributed. Starting with a high initial tax on carbon
    leads to an immediate steep reduction of emissions in almost all regions, and
    a slight variation in the carbon tax rate, which matters only in the long run,
    has little effect on the time path of emissions.
  19: The study finds that the different regions stop using dirty energy at very different
    dates. China, for instance, stops using all fossil fuels in roughly 20 years compared
    to 75 years under BAU, and Russia stops emitting carbon roughly 80 years earlier
    than in BAU due to the carbon policy.
  22: Fig. 8 shows the regional temperature in the 6x case as a function of years
    and different carbon tax policies.
  24: The analysis suggests that while carbon policy can impact the distribution of
    global economic power, some trends (like China's rise) are largely independent
    of climate policy. The paper mentions a 'UWI policy' and a 'UWIL policy' but the
    details are provided in other sections.
  28: The study acknowledges a time consistency problem with the redistributive aspect
    of UWI policy and proposes alternative policies (UWIF, UWIL) to mitigate this
    issue. The study uses a high-damage climate change scenario.
  29: The paper references figures that project demographics and compares damages
    predicted in this study to those predicted by DICE (Nordhaus, 2017).
  34: The analysis starts in 2017 (year 0).
Quantitative material:
  1: Carbon taxation can raise welfare by 4.3 percent; Limiting compensatory payments
    to less than 10 percent can deliver a 4.0 percent or higher welfare gain
  2: For the U.S., the reduction in 2100 GDP is 13.9 percent without the UWI policy
    and 8.0 percent with it.
  3: Under a high-damage baseline scenario (no policy), the increase in the planet's
    mean surface temperature through 2100 is approximately 3.1 degrees Celsius. Canada
    and Russia's GDP levels in 2100 are 2.5% and 3.6% higher, respectively, compared
    with no climate change. Climate change lowers 2100 GDP levels by 38.6% (India),
    33.4% (South Asian Pacific), 33.0% (Sub-Saharan Africa), and 30.9% (Middle East
    and North Africa). Global GDP in 2100 is reduced by 14.7%. Dirty energy lasts
    through 2217 years in BAU scenario. Under optimal UWI policy, dirty energy usage
    ends by 2103, and cumulative oil, gas, and coal consumption (2017 to fossil fuel
    end date) reduces by 84.4%, 86.2%, and 98.1%, respectively. This limits the rise
    in the global mean surface temperature to 2.1 degrees Celsius. Peak global GDP
    loss declines from 16.7% to 9.3%. Peak regional damages range from 0.5% to 27.8%
    of GDP compared with 2.1% to 43.9% under BAU. The optimal UWI gain is 4.3% measured
    as consumption compensating variation.

  26: The 2017 SCC for India is $10.58, for Brazil is $3.12, and the global SCC is
    $111.69, for the 6x damage scenario BAU case.
  27: Quantitative results include changes in emissions and welfare gains, such as
    a Chinese-only carbon tax increasing other regions' emissions by 17% by 2250,
    and UWI gains reduction from 4.3% to 2.8% for delaying optimal UWI tax implementation.
  28: Peak GDP regional losses under 'high damage scenario' ranging as high as 43.9%
    in India, exceeding 30% for SSA, SLA, MENA, BRA, and SAP. For the US, losses peak
    at 17.1%. Russia and Canada see peak output gains of 3.9% and 2.6%, respectively,
    under BAU. The UWIL carbon tax starts at $91.4 per ton of CO2, rising at roughly
    1.5% per year. Peak temperature rise under UWIL policy is 2.1 degrees Celsius
    versus 3.7 degrees under BAU. Peak global damages under UWIL are 9.2% of the planet's
    GDP. For India, damages peak at 27.5% of GDP under UWIL versus 43.9% under BAU.
    Optimal UWI gain is 4.3%, UWIF policy provides all future generations with a 7.7%
    welfare gain. Indians born in 2200 pay the equivalent of 38.2 percent of lifetime
