Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, carbon emissions, policy choices (carbon taxation and redistribution)
  2: Anthropogenic climate change, specifically carbon emissions leading to rising
    global temperatures.
  3: Long-lasting significant damages from delays in ending dirty energy use; high
    atmospheric carbon concentration.
  4: Delays in carbon taxation, 'use it or lose it' strategies by dirty energy producers,
    and the participation of key countries like China in carbon policy.
  5: Reduction in TFP due to rise in global temperatures; initial prevailing climates
    can influence the degree of GDP decline.
  6: The model considers changes in total factor productivity (TFP), implicitly driven
    by climate change. The model considers clean energy production and dirty energy
    consumption.
  9: Climate change impacts are modeled through carbon emissions, atmospheric concentration,
    and temperature changes.
  10: Global average temperature changes leading to regional temperature deviations
    from an optimal temperature (T*), impacting regional TFP.
  12: Dependence on specific energy sources (e.g., coal), leading to higher carbon
    emissions for a given GDP.
  13: "The paper analyzes the impact of different damage functions and degrees of\
    \ climate sensitivity, captured by varying the parameter \u03BA, on regional temperatures\
    \ and economic outcomes."
  14: Global mean temperature increases driven by different damage function specifications
    (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x).
  15: Different climate damage scenarios (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x) representing varying sensitivities
    to the shape of the upper tail of the damage function.
  16: The damage function sensitivity impacts optimal carbon taxes and welfare outcomes
    with carbon policy transferring burden to future generations, increasing global
    interest rates under UWI policy.
  17: Damage case (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x increases in damages);
  18: Policy regarding the used in producing green energy and carbon taxes (rebated
    to dirty-energy companies).
  19: The primary driver of risk is the level of climate damage (specified as 4x or
    6x damage), which influences the optimal carbon tax.
  20: No relevant information
  22: Carbon taxes.
  23: Climate change, absent mitigation
  24: Climate change (6x damage scenario) and carbon policy (BAU vs. Optimal).
  25: High emissions, larger long-run damages, substitutability of clean for dirty
    energy, and coal supply elasticity.
  26: 6x damage scenario (presumably related to climate change impacts); Imperfect
    substitutability between dirty and clean energy in the short and medium run; Business-as-usual
    (BAU) case
  27: Global CO2 emissions, carbon tax policies (level, growth rate, timing, and participation),
    general equilibrium effects, and the 'Green Paradox' (accelerated fossil fuel
    burning due to anticipated carbon taxes)
  28: Climate change driven by fossil fuel usage.
  30: Different climate change scenarios (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x forcing) and policy scenarios
    (BAU - Business As Usual, UWI - unclear what this represents, but is a policy
    scenario).
  35: The 6x damage specification (likely referring to a climate change damage scenario)
    is the primary driver influencing gas consumption.
Highlights:
  1: Carbon taxation, coupled with region- and generation-specific transfers, can
    both correct the carbon externality and raise the welfare of all current and future
    agents across all regions. Carbon taxes alone are insufficient unless all major
    emitters adopt them immediately.
  2: A uniform welfare improving carbon tax, coupled with interregional and intergenerational
    redistribution, can substantially limit the damage of climate change while making
    everyone, across space and time, equally better off. Climate change will generally
    undermine economic growth, but this impact will vary by region. The carbon tax
    can also reduce damages materially.
  3: Optimal UWI policy ends all dirty energy usage by 2103 and limits global mean
    temperature rise to 2.1 degrees Celsius.
  4: China's participation is crucial for carbon policy to significantly reduce emissions;
    delays in carbon policy reduce its value by 35 percent; future global GDP distribution
    is largely unchanged by climate policy.
  5: Labor productivity catch-up growth can dominate growth over time even with significant
    climate damage.
  10: Regional total factor productivity is modeled to peak at an optimal temperature
    (T*), suggesting some regions could benefit or be harmed from climate deviations.
  12: China's carbon emissions are twice that of the US and three times that of the
    WEU, despite a smaller GDP, due to its reliance on coal.
  13: Table 4 presents region-specific productivity growth rates relative to the US,
    which are applied through 2100.
  14: Under BAU, global temperature increases significantly, but the magnitude of
    damages varies substantially across regions and damage function specifications.
    Some regions (Russia, Canada) may experience gains due to global warming, while
    others (India, US, China, Japan/South Korea/Hong Kong) face significant GDP losses.
  15: Global peak GDP loss in the 6x damage scenario is close to 17%. Some regions
    can experience gains from climate change (e.g., Russia and Canada).
  16: UWI policy can result in a major win-win with welfare gains across all generations
    and regions, ranging from 3.0% to 4.3%, depending on damage scenarios, but re-distributive
    policy increases peak regional damages slightly.
  17: Optimal carbon taxation cannot be determined without deciding how to distribute
    the efficiency gains from taxing carbon.  The average annual carbon tax real growth
    rate of the 6x damage specification ranges from 1.4 to 1.5 percent. UWI makes
    everyone better off but comes at a very high net tax cost to India and other low-income
    regions that are most vulnerable to climate change. Under the SCC-based UWIL carbon
    taxation, welfare gains are uniform for all region-specific generations not subject
    to the limit, and higher for those subject to the limit.
  18: Regions that do not exceed the 10 percent limit have a slightly lower UWI gain
    under UWIL (4.0%) compared to the uniform gain (4.3%). Some regions enjoy much
    larger welfare gains under UWIL policy.
  19: Implementing a UWIL policy can significantly improve the welfare of future generations.
    Carbon taxation, regardless of the compensation scheme, can dramatically limit
    the increase in temperature, keeping it within or near the 2.0-degree limit set
    in the Paris Agreement. Carbon taxation can dramatically reduce regional climate
    damage; the reduction is almost 50 percent for almost all regions.
  20: No relevant information
  22: Optimal carbon taxes can lead to a marked reduction in fossil fuel consumption,
    yielding long-term benefits. Carbon taxes may require compensating current generations
    to avoid welfare losses.
  23: Under the UWI policy, regions like India, BRA, SAP, MENA, SLA, and SSA would
    face significant consumption losses in the future due to the need to service carbon-policy
    debt, despite being poorer and potentially less responsible for the externality.
  24: China is projected to eclipse the US economically with or without a carbon policy.
    The end of the US economic hegemony is essentially independent of carbon damage
    and carbon policy. Carbon policy has a potentially significant impact on India's
    share of global GDP.
  25: Infinite coal reserves increase gains from climate policy, while imperfect substitutability
    reduces them. Optimal tax rates diverge over time and are lower in high emission
    scenarios.
  26: The regional SCC can be small even in regions projected to experience large
    damages (e.g., India and Brazil). The issue of partial participation (regional
    taxes on emissions) is problematic, suggesting limited welfare gains from regional
    action alone.
  27: Carbon taxation needs to be global to be effective; Delaying carbon taxation
    reduces UWI gains; China's participation in carbon taxation significantly impacts
    global welfare gains, especially in higher damage scenarios; Non-participating
    regions increase their use of fossil fuels when other regions impose carbon taxes.
  28: Absent policy, climate change could cause substantial GDP losses in many regions,
    particularly India. A compensatory carbon tax policy (UWIL) can achieve welfare
    gains across regions and generations and substantially reduce climate damage.
    However, the redistributive aspect of the policy might be difficult to enforce.
  29: The paper finds that the SCC is high for regions with high total GDP, notably
    China and the USA. The taxes have a dramatic effect on coal use.
  30: The social cost of carbon generally increases over time and with higher levels
    of climate forcing. There is significant regional variation in the social cost
    of carbon. Under some scenarios, the social cost of carbon can be negative (for
    RUS, CND and EEU), suggesting potential short-term economic benefits from climate
    change in those regions.
  35: The study compares the effects of different policies on gas consumption under
    a specific climate change damage scenario.
Methodology:
  1: Large-scale, annually calibrated, multi-region, overlapping generations model
    of climate change and carbon policy with region-specific temperature and damage
    functions. The phased impact of emissions on temperature is calibrated to the
    latest scientific evidence.
  2: A large-scale, multi-region, overlapping generations (OLG) model with 18 regions
    and 80 overlapping generations is used. The model incorporates regional demographic
    conditions, output production with capital, labor, and both dirty and clean energy,
    and equations connecting carbon emissions to global temperature. The model considers
    a uniform welfare improving (UWI) carbon tax policy. The applicability of the
    results is contingent on the model's assumptions and calibration, including a
    focus on a 'worst-case scenario' damage function.
  3: Region-specific emissions and damages modeled with an OLG IAM using pattern scaling;
    relies on a calibrated damage function.
  4: The analysis uses a model assessing carbon taxation's impact on various generations,
    regions, and coalitions; it also incorporates assumptions about coal reserves,
    energy substitutability, and GDP distribution projections.
  5: The analysis uses a model calibrated for examining proportionate GDP declines
    and productivity impacts due to global temperature rise.
  6: The paper uses a dynamic general equilibrium model with region-specific firms
    and households to analyze the macroeconomic effects of climate change. It defines
    a competitive equilibrium and uses a climate emulator for computations. The model
    is solved computationally.
  9: A multi-region overlapping generations (OLG) model is used, adopting the functional
    form of DICE for climate evolution.
  10: Uses pattern scaling with the CCSM4 model under RCP8.5 scenario to calculate
    regional temperatures weighted by GDP to derive temperature impacts on regional
    TFP.
  12: "The ratio of each region\u2019s total energy consumption as a share of its\
    \ GDP provides our measure of 1 \u2212 \U0001D6FC\U0001D467\u2212 \U0001D6FD\U0001D467\
    . To determine values for  \U0001D6FC\U0001D467and \U0001D6FD\U0001D467, we assume\
    \ that one-third of this remaining output share is paid to capital with the rest\
    \ paid to labor."
  13: "The paper uses a general equilibrium model and calibrates it using various\
    \ data sources, including M\xFCller et al. (2019) for productivity growth, United\
    \ Nations (2019b) for population projections, and McGlade and Ekins (2015) for\
    \ fossil fuel reserves. The productivity growth rate differentials are applied\
    \ through 2100, after which all regions are assumed to have the same 1.56% productivity\
    \ growth rate as the US. The climate block of the DICE model is adopted from Folini\
    \ et al.(2024). The paper varies the parameter \u03BA to capture different damage\
    \ functions and degrees of climate sensitivity."
  14: Simulates Business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios with different damage function specifications
    and carbon policies.
  15: The paper uses a climate emulator calibrated to the multi-model mean of CMIP5
    simulations, projecting economic outcomes under a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario.
    The analysis considers various factors including damage functions, fossil fuel
    reserves, extraction costs, and clean-energy productivity growth.
  17: The authors use simulations to model the effects of carbon taxation and transfer
    policies on various economic outcomes. The model considers different damage scenarios
    (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x) and transfer policies (No Transfers, UWI, UWIF, UWIL).
  19: The analysis uses a model to simulate the impact of different carbon tax policies
    (UWIL, UWIF) on emissions, temperature, and economic damages across different
    regions. The year 0 on the x-axis of Fig. 5 represents 2017. The analysis seems
    applicable to understanding the impact of carbon taxation on climate change and
    economic outcomes at a regional/national level.
  20: No relevant information
  21: The analysis considers different policies and is measured as a function of years,
    starting from 2017. The x-axis also references the year of birth for the 6x damage
    specification.
  22: The analysis uses a model to determine optimal carbon taxes and net transfers
    to different generations, with year 0 on the x-axis of Fig. 8 being 2017.
  24: Simulation model projecting regional GDP shares under different climate damage
    and policy scenarios.
  25: The analysis involves BAU and optimal policy scenarios with different assumptions
    about coal reserves and substitutability of clean and dirty energy.
  26: The analysis involves calculating regional and global SCC under different policies
    and a 6x damage scenario. The time horizon appears to extend from 2017 onwards
    (year 0 is 2017).
  27: The analysis uses a model to simulate the effects of different carbon tax policies
    and regional cooperation scenarios on global CO2 emissions and welfare gains.
    The model incorporates general equilibrium effects and considers different damage
    specifications (1x, 2x, 4x, 6x).
  28: The paper uses a model to simulate the effects of climate change and different
    carbon tax policies on GDP and welfare across regions and generations. It considers
    high damage scenarios and explores the impact of carbon taxes with and without
    compensatory transfers, including Uniform Welfare Improvement (UWI), Uniform Welfare
    Improvement for Future generations (UWIF), and Uniform Welfare Improvement with
    limited taxes (UWIL) policies. The time frame considered extends to 2200 and beyond.
  29: The paper uses a computational model with backward induction to solve a system
    of equations. The optimal carbon tax path is found using an iterative procedure,
    updating the carbon tax to the SCC in each iteration.
  30: The methodology is not explicitly stated, but it involves calculating the social
    cost of carbon under different climate and policy scenarios, likely using an integrated
    assessment model. The results are applicable to the specified countries/regions
    and time periods.
  35: The analysis examines the effect of different policies on gas consumption under
    a 6x damage specification. The time horizon spans multiple years from a baseline
    of 2017.
More Notes:
  1: The study considers region-specific impacts, including potentially catastrophic
    long-term damages in India, Brazil, and the South Asian Pacific. The model incorporates
    the phased impact of emissions on temperature.
  9: Pattern scaling is used for inferring regional temperatures from global averages
    in a computationally efficient manner.
  12: The paper calculates region-specific dirty-energy share parameters and uses
    them to construct the price of the dirty-energy composite. It also pins down the
    2017 price of clean energy as well as the 2017 dirty-energy consumption by region.
  13: The paper uses the DICE model's climate emulator, recalibrated with CMIP5 benchmark
    data, leading to less long-term warming compared to the original DICE model.
  14: Lower damages may lead to higher GDP, and higher emissions as a result. The
    gains from global warming are assumed to be moderate.
  15: The magnitude of global damages is highly sensitive to the shape of the upper
    tail of the damage function. BAU emissions are significantly lower than in DICE
    or RCP8.5, falling between RCP6.0 and RCP4.5 scenarios.
  17: The analysis considers the impact of different transfer policies (UWI, UWIF,
    UWIL) on welfare gains and regional transfers.  The paper focuses on SCC-based
    carbon taxation. The study highlights the heterogeneity in regional impacts and
    the importance of transfer policies in mitigating negative consequences.
  19: The paper emphasizes the heterogeneous nature of climate damages across regions.
    The quick substitution of clean energy, gas, and oil for coal may seem unrealistic
    but the authors argues that such a substitution is arguably already underway in
    China and other regions.
  20: No relevant information
  23: The analysis focuses on intergenerational and inter-regional transfers required
    under a specific (unspecified) carbon policy, highlighting the potential burden
    on future generations in certain regions. The reason why India should pay more
    than the US is not explained in this page.
  24: The US and China experience roughly equal proportionate climate damages as a
    share of GDP. Western Europe's global GDP share surpasses the US share by the
    century's end in the BAU scenario, but this gap is reduced with carbon policy.
  25: The paper explores carbon tax impacts across regions and highlights challenges
    of international participation due to free-rider problems.
  26: Tables 9 and 10 in Appendix A.2 provide regional SCC values for different regions
    and years. The SCC is only significant in China and the US in this scenario. The
    impact of large regional tax on emissions and warming is relatively small.
  27: The paper mentions a 'Black Paradox' resembling the 'Green Paradox' which refers
    to increased emissions in non-participating regions when others implement carbon
    taxes.
  28: The paper explores the impact of different policies on the duration of fossil
    fuel usage.
  29: The paper considers a 6x specification of the damage function, and the optimal
    policy refers to the UWI (Uniform World Interest?) policy. The paper acknowledges
    projected population declines in almost all regions, except the US, CND, SSA,
    and ANZ. The repository URL is provided for replication.

Quantitative material:
  1: Climate change may dramatically reduce GDP in most regions under high-damage
    scenarios. Carbon taxation and transfers can raise welfare by 4.3 percent. Limiting
    redistribution burdens can still deliver a 4.0 percent or higher welfare gain.
  2: "Without policy, climate change is projected to cause a 14% drop in global output\
    \ by 2100. An initial $87.5 carbon tax rising annually at 1.4% could limit global\
    \ damages in 2100 to a 9% drop in global output. For India, the percentage decline\
    \ in end-of-century output is limited from 38.5% to 26.2% with the tax. For the\
    \ U.S., the reduction in 2100 GDP is 13.9% without the UWI policy and 8.0% with\
    \ it. China\u2019s respective values are 13.7% without policy and 7.8% with policy.\
    \ For Canada, climate change will raise GDP in 2100 by 2.5% without policy, while\
    \ the UWI policy reduces Canada\u2019s 2100 GDP by 0.6% relative to its no climate-change\
    \ level."
  3: Optimal UWI policy reduces peak global GDP loss from 16.7% to 9.3%; oil, gas,
    and coal consumption reduced by 84.4%, 86.2%, and 98.1%, respectively.
  4: The findings include quantitative estimates such as the net tax on future generations
    (e.g., Indian generations born after 2200 facing net taxes roughly 40 percent
    of lifetime consumption) and the reduction in welfare gain by 35 percent if carbon
    policy is delayed for 20 years.
  6: The model uses equations to quantify the relationships between capital, labor,
    energy, and land in production functions.
  12: Table 2 presents region-specific 2017 GDP (in trillions of 2017 USD) and energy
    consumption (in quad Btus) of coal, natural gas, petroleum and other liquids,
    nuclear, renewables, and others per individual region.

    CHI, EEU, GBR, IND, JSHK, MENA, MEX, RUS, SAF, SAP, SLA, SOV, SSA, WEU) relative
    to the US productivity growth rate. For example, ANZ's productivity growth is
    -0.11% relative to the US, while CHI's is 2.54%.
  14: Global temperature increases of 3.7 to 4.4 degrees Celsius over the next 200
    years under BAU. Global damages peak at almost 17% of world output in the 6x damage
    scenario. India's damages reach over 40% of GDP by 2200 in the 6x damage scenario.
    Damages in 2200 for the US, China, and Japan/South Korea/Hong Kong exceed 16%
    of output in the 6x damage scenario. GBR experiences small damages, peaking at
    just 2.1% of GDP. Russia and Canada's climate gains peak above 3.9% and 2.6% of
    GDP, respectively.
  15: Table 5 provides peak GDP losses/gains (%) for various regions (US, WEU, JSHK,
    CHI, IND, RUS, CND, EEU, SAP, BRA, MEX, SAF, MENA, SLA, SSA, SOV, GBR, ANZ, GLOBAL)
    under the 1x, 2x, 4x, and 6x damage scenarios, along with corresponding maximum
    global temperature rise.
  16: Optimal initial carbon taxes range from $22.8 to $111.7 per ton CO2; significant
    future consumption transfers under the UWI policy, especially in heavily affected
    regions like India, where more than 40% of consumption could be surrendered.
  17: Table 6 provides quantitative data on various outcomes under different damage
    cases and transfer policies (No Transfers, UWI, UWIF, UWIL). For example, with
    'No Transfers' under the 2x Damage case, the Welfare gains are -9.1% to -8.0%.
  18: Uniform Welfare Index (UWI) gain of 4.3 percent and 4.0 percent under UWIL policy
    for generations in regions that do not exceed the limit.

    damages (as percentage of GDP) under different carbon tax policies (UWI, UWIF).
    It also includes quantitative values for welfare gains and the required net tax
    as a percentage of lifetime consumption. The page specifies that under the 6x
    damage specification, the optimal global carbon tax is calculated in $ per ton
    of CO2.

    ANZ) in 2017, 2050, 2100, and 2150 under both Business-as-Usual (BAU) and Optimal
    carbon policy scenarios.
  25: Optimal tax in the first period is $83.6 per ton of CO2 compared to $87.5 in
    the baseline, and decreases to $448 per ton over 100 years compared to $543.
  26: 2017 SCC for India is $10.58; 2017 SCC for Brazil is $3.12; Global SCC in the
    6x damage scenario BAU case is $111.69
  27: "A $100 carbon tax levied by all regions apart from China, grown annually at\
    \ 1.5 percent, produces a 1.5 percent UWI gain for coalition members; Three coalitions\
    \ with positive welfare gains: UWI gains equal to 1.6 percent for all regions\

  30: The table provides quantitative estimates of the social cost of carbon for various
    countries/regions (USA, WEU, JSHK, CHI, IND, RUS, CND, EEU, SAP) under different
    climate change and policy scenarios for the years 2017, 2025, 2050, and 2100.
  35: Gas consumption is measured in quad Btu on the y-axis. Time is measured on the
    x-axis in years, where year 0 corresponds to 2017.
