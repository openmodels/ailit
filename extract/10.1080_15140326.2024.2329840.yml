Highlights:
  3: "Climate change regime-dependent monetary policy is characterized; Expansionary\
    \ monetary policy is less efficient and the negative impact of tight monetary\
    \ policy is enhanced when climate change is severe; Climate-induced credit constraint\
    \ of commercial banks explains the results; Higher temperature shocks lead to\
    \ increases in banks\u2019 non-performing loan ratios, resulting in larger credit\
    \ constraints and a weakened bank credit channel of monetary policy transmissions."
  4: The influence of monetary policy on economic output is climate change regime-dependent.
    Temperature shocks weaken the efficiency of expansionary monetary policy and worsen
    the effects of contractionary monetary policy. Asymmetries in monetary policy
    effects are more apparent under high-temperature regimes. Climate change affects
    the effectiveness of monetary policy by increasing credit constraints for commercial
    banks (through increased loan default rates and non-performing loan ratios).
  7: "High temperatures weaken firm profitability, which deteriorates firm balance\
    \ sheets and firms\u2019 ability to repay loans from banks, increasing non-performing\
    \ loan ratios."
  8: The paper investigates how climate change affects the influence of monetary policy
    through temperature shocks as a threshold variable.
  11: The paper uses a TVAR model to analyze the impact of temperature shocks (deviations
    from historical averages) on macroeconomic variables like GDP and CPI, also taking
    into consideration monetary policy (M2).
  12: High temperature regimes weaken the efficiency of monetary expansions and worsen
    the effects of monetary tightening on GDP. Monetary policy transmission is temperature-regime
    dependent.
  13: Climate change leads to larger fluctuations in economic outputs and prolongs
    divergence from steady states.
  14: The study reveals different impacts of monetary policy on GDP when subjected
    to high and low temperature shocks.
  16: Monetary policy effectiveness is lower under higher temperature shocks.
  17: Use of different time frames (20, 25, 30 years) for temperature deviations to
    show how monetary policy shocks affect GDP under varying temperature regimes.
  18: Climate change impacts the effectiveness of monetary policy due to increased
    credit constraints under high-temperature regimes.
  19: The impulse responses show how output (GDP_ind) reacts to monetary policy shocks
    differently under high and low-temperature shock regimes. The graphs suggest that
    the impact of monetary policy on output is conditional on the temperature regime.
  21: Temperature increases weaken the efficiency of monetary expansions and exacerbate
    negative effects of monetary tightening; temperature shocks increase the non-performing
    loan ratio of banks.
  22: Climate change weakens the credit channel of monetary policy transmission. Tight
    monetary policy has stronger effects in both high- and low-temperature regimes,
    especially under high-temperature regimes. Central banks should incorporate climate
    change into their monetary policy framework.
  25: Climate risks and natural disasters can significantly impact economic production,
    financial stability, and firm investment.

More Notes:
  3: The paper investigates whether climate change affects the efficiency of monetary
    policy in China.
  4: The paper suggests that policymakers should consider climate change in monetary
    policy formulations. Expansionary monetary policy could be more aggressive when
    temperatures are higher, and contractionary monetary policy could be more conservative
    when climate change is severe.
  7: The paper proposes a climate-induced credit constraint where high temperatures
    increase bank non-performing loan ratios, making banks more risk averse and dampening
    the efficiency of monetary policies.
  9: The temperature data used spans from 2004Q2 to 2021Q4.
  11: 'The sample period for the analysis is 2004Q2 to 2021Q4. The ADF tests suggest
    the variables are stationary. Nonlinearity tests indicate that using a TVAR model
    is reasonable (significant p-values for 1vs2 and 1vs3 tests) in some cases. '
  19: The paper also investigates the impact of temperature shocks on bank lending
    and non-performing loans.
  22: The study focuses on the banking sector's role in monetary policy transmission
    in China. The authors suggest future research should investigate the role of capital
