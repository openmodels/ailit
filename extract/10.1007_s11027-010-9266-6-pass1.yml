Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts based on the IPCC A2-scenario impacting forest biomass.
  3: Climate change impacts on biomass in forests.
  6: Population growth, changes in natural resource availability, and technological
    change.
  7: Declining availability of fluid fossil fuels, climate change impacts on vegetation
    growth.
  10: Climate change impacts on Indian forests (CCI) and globally (CCG), temperature
    and precipitation changes in six Indian zones, with increases specified for 2085.
  12: Higher biomass growth due to climate change increases pressure on forested land,
    impacting infrastructure changes and deforestation.
  13: Climate change impacts on forestry, specifically changes in biomass growth and
    rent (shadow price of timber).
  14: Reduction in forest harvest due to climate change leading to changes in biomass
    growth, shifts in capital and labour costs, changes in world market for timber.
  15: Climate change impacts on forests, leading to changes in rotation period, forest
    rent, infrastructure investments, and technology choices.
Highlights:
  1: Major variations in the pattern of change across zones in biomass stock and growth
    due to climate change.
  3: The study combines adaptation within regions with repercussions from global impacts
    on forests in the market for forest products. It shows the impacts of climate
    change on biomass for the rotation age of the forests in different zones in India
    and derives macroeconomic impacts.
  10: The model predicts impacts on forest biomass, productivity, and harvest based
    on climate change scenarios, with regional variations across India.
  12: The macroeconomic implications of climate change-induced forest changes are
    minor since forestry makes a minor contribution to India's GDP, with only a 1%
    increase.
  13: Climate change affects wages and capital prices differently in different zones,
    depending on biomass growth. Wage reductions could lead to local unemployment
    if wages are sticky.
  14: Reduction in forest harvest can affect capital and labour prices, leading to
    shifting production zones. India's timber trade is impacted with changes in exports
    and imports, more pronounced in the CCI scenario. The lumber industry can move
    more easily to less costly zones.
  15: Higher biomass growth may increase deforestation risk due to decreased land
    value for forests and increased harvest intensity.
Methodology:
  1: Integrating results from the dynamic global vegetation model IBIS and the computable
    general equilibrium model GRACE-IN.
  2: The study examines adaptation to climate change in Indian forests and its macroeconomic
    implications for India. It uses the ecological model IBIS to estimate climate
    change impacts in six Indian sub-regions and implements these results into a global
    computable general equilibrium model focusing on India (GRACE-IN) with a forestry
    module designed to optimize forest management in each of the six zones.
  3: The study integrates the ecological model IBIS with the economic model GRACE-IN.
    It divides India into six zones to account for climate change variations and geographical
    barriers to adaptation. The study focuses on the timber value of forests and analyzes
    the impact of climate change on forest rotation age, harvest, and market responses.
  4: GRACE-IN model divides the world into three regions (EU, India, ROW) and further
    divides India into six zones to analyze regional climatic variability and impact
    of market barriers to adaptation.
  6: The paper uses a global bank and trust to allocate investments based on returns
    to capital, subject to elasticities of transformation. Economic growth is attributed
    to savings, population growth, changes in natural resource availability, and technological
    change. The model assumes full utilization of available resources within each
    region, with free flow of labor and capital between sectors within each sub-region.
    For India, the flow of labour and capital across zones is constrained to reflect
    barriers to adaptation to climate change.
  7: The GRACE-IN model is used to analyze the forestry sector, linking it to the
    IBIS model to account for climate change impacts on vegetation growth. A Lotka-Volterra
    equation is implemented to describe forest dynamics. The model incorporates a
    nested CES-tree structure where capital and natural resources form an aggregate
    of initial endowments.
  10: The IBIS model calculates biomass, converted to sawtimber. A Lotka-Volterra
    function is calibrated based on sawlog recovery factor. The model runs from 2004-2085
    under a reference scenario (A2_ASF), CCI and CCG scenarios.
  12: The study considers the impacts of climate change on forests, focusing on changes
    in net primary productivity and harvest across different zones and the associated
    macroeconomic results.
  13: An economic model with zones and consideration of input factor mobility (labour,
    capital, natural resources), market responses (changes in product prices and rent),
    and substitution between timber and other input factors.
  14: Study uses the CCI and CCG scenarios to predict climate change impacts on forestry
    in India. Results apply to 2045 and 2085.
  15: Analysis performed using the computable general equilibrium model GRACE integrated
    with the IBIS ecological model, focused on forestry impacts across six Indian
    zones.
More Notes:
  1: Increased biomass growth can lead to lower timber prices and rent on forested
    land, discouraging further harvest and potentially increasing deforestation risk
    in less perfect markets.
  3: Adaptation in this study mainly refers to adjustment of own economic behavior
    by households and communities in response to changes in market signals due to
    climate change impacts, without public-policy interventions (autonomous or spontaneous
    adaptation).
  6: The table at the top of the page describes forest typologies by Indian zones
    but appears unrelated to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks and costs/benefits
    of adaptation.
  13: The impact on wages and capital is small relative to the total economies of
    the zones, but can be substantial for communities where forestry is a major activity
    due to constrained mobility.
  14: Advantages of being able to move activities around to areas with lower production
    costs can be traced. Impacts on total production costs were too small to give
    a benefit.
  15: The study's results should be interpreted with caution due to various modeling
    simplifications and assumptions.

  11: This page primarily discusses the impact of climate change on forest biomass,
    rotation periods, and land rent, with limited direct links to macroeconomic or
    macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level. While changes in land rent could indirectly
    influence the broader economy, this is not explicitly modeled or quantified in
    terms of GDP, budget balance, etc. on this page.

    forests for India.
  3: Macroeconomic impacts derived from responses in Indian and global markets, including
    relative factor price changes and changes in demand locally and globally.
  10: Impacts on the forestry sector, measured by biomass (kg/m2, m3/ha), sawtimber
    recovery, and net primary productivity (106 tC), and harvest (106 tC), influenced

  13: Changes in wages, price of capital, and unemployment.
  14: GDP effects, production costs, lumber industry output, trade (exports/imports).
  15: The macroeconomic impacts for each zone are very small because forestry is small
    compared with the total Indian economy.
Quantitative material:
  1: Harvest increases by approximately 1/3 of the change in biomass growth in four
    zones with increased biomass growth.
  3: No specific quantitative information on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes is provided
