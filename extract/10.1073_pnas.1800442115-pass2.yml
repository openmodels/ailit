Drivers of Risk:
  1: Ambient temperature, tropospheric carbon dioxide(CO2) and ozone(O3) concentrations,
    water availability and salinization
  5: Increased water salinity, raised tropospheric CO2 concentrations, raised tropospheric
    O3 concentrations, increased ambient temperature, decreased water availability.
  7: Heat stress could affect producers directly and cause reduced labour productivity.
Highlights:
  1: Environmental change would have a negative impact on yields without suitable
    responses from the agricultural sector.
  5: Increasing ambient temperature in (sub-)tropical areas, tropospheric O3 and water
    salinity and decreasing water availability would all negatively affect vegetable
    and legume yields in the absence of adaptation strategies. Increasing CO2 concentrations
    will have a positive impact on vegetable and legume yields, although these increases
    might be substantially attenuated in the presence of other environmental stressors.
  7: Negative impacts are most likely to occur in poorly functioning markets and among
    poor rural and urban populations.
Methodology:
  1: Systematic review and meta-analysis of articles published between 1975 and 2016
    on the effect of ambient temperature, tropospheric carbon dioxide(CO2) and ozone(O3)
    concentrations, water availability and salinization on the yields and nutritional
    quality of vegetables and legumes. Estimated the mean effects of standardised
    environmental changes using observed exposure-response relationships and conducted
    meta-analysis where possible.
  5: Systematic review and synthesis of experimental studies on the impact of changes
    in environmental exposures on yields and nutritional quality of legumes and non-staple
    vegetables under a business as usual scenario.
  7: Meta-analysis used where possible, but limited by the small percentage of papers
    reporting precision estimates.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the impact of environmental changes on the yields and nutritional
    quality of vegetables and legumes, not on macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes
    directly. However, it suggests that reduced yields could impact global availability,
    affordability, and consumption, which could potentially have indirect macroeconomic
    consequences.
  5: The review suggests that the negative impacts on yields resulting from raised
    CO2 concentrations may be important in future impact assessments, given that increases
    in CO2 concentrations and ambient temperature are likely to occur concomitantly.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  5: Vegetable and legume yields, nutritional quality of leafy vegetables and Solanaceae,
    concentrations of zinc, iron, calcium and magnesium in root vegetables.
  7: Potential health impacts of reductions in non-staple vegetable and legume consumption
    include increased risk of non-communicable diseases and nutrient deficiencies,
    which could affect population health and economic impacts.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Mean yield changes(all vegetables and legume groups combined) were +22.0%[+11.6\
    \ to+32.5] for 250ppm increase in CO2 concentration; -8.9% [-15.6 to-2.2] for\
    \ 25% increase in O3 concentration;-34.7%[-44.6 to-24.9] for 50% reduction in\
    \ water availability; and -2.3%[-3.7 to -0.9] for 25% increase in salinity. In\
    \ papers with baseline temperatures >20\xB0C, exposure to 4\xB0C increase in temperature\
    \ reduced mean yields(-31.5%[-41.4 to-21.5])."
  5: '25% increase in salinity of irrigation water resulted in a mean yield change
    of -2.3% (95% CI: -3.7 to -0.9).'
