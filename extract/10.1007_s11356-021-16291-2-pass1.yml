Drivers of Risk:
  4: Climate change (CO2 level, average annual temperature, rainfall), Primary energy
    consumption per capita, Total fertilizers by nutrients
  7: Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, average annual temperature, rainfall, primary energy
    consumption per capita, total fertilizers by nutrients used in agricultural sector
    (X).
  8: "CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita), Temperature (\xB0C), Average annual\
    \ rainfall (mm per year), Primary energy consumption (gigajoules per capita),\
    \ Total fertilizers by nutrients used in agricultural sector (tones)."
  10: Not explicitly stated on this page, but the analysis investigates cointegration
    between lnAGR and other (unstated) variables, suggesting that changes in these
    other variables drive changes in agricultural output.
  11: CO2 emission level, Temperature, Rainfall
  12: CO2 emissions (lnCO2), Temperature (lnTEMP), Rainfall (lnRF), Energy consumption
    (lnEC), Fertilizer expenditure (lnFE).
Highlights:
  4: Examines consequences of climate change on agricultural productivity under short-term
    and long-term distinction, especially for certain Asian countries.
  9: Results indicate mixed evidence of non-stationarity at levels, but all variables
    are stationary at first differences, i.e., integrated of order one, or I(1).
  10: The evidence suggests that there is a long-run relationship (cointegration)
    between lnAGR and the other variables used in the model.
  11: CO2 emissions and temperature have a significant negative impact on agricultural
    productivity in the long run, while rainfall has a positive impact.
  12: In the long run, increases in CO2 emissions and temperature are negatively associated
    with agricultural productivity, while increases in rainfall, energy consumption,
    and fertilizer expenditure are positively associated with agricultural productivity
    (based on the PMG results). In the short run, the impacts of CO2 emissions and
    energy consumption on agricultural productivity have significant effects, with
    opposite signs compared to the long-run effects.
Methodology:
  4: Advanced panel data techniques include three different tests, namely, mean group
    (MG), pooled mean group (PMG), and dynamic fixed effect (DFE) estimators; Focusing
    on the short and long-run effect of three climate variables as CO2 level, average
    annual temperature and rainfall on agricultural productivity in Asian countries.
  7: Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model estimation using mean group (MG),
    pooled mean group (PMG), and dynamic fixed effect (DFE) estimators; Hausman h-test
    to determine the most efficient model.
  8: Panel ARDL estimators are used to estimate short-run and long-run relationships
    between agricultural productivity and climate change variables. Unit root tests
    are conducted to verify the stationarity of the variables, ensuring they are not
    I(2) to avoid spurious results. All variables are transformed into natural logarithmic
    forms to alleviate multicollinearity.
  9: The analysis involves testing for non-stationarity using panel unit root tests
    (Im, Pesaran and Shin; Levin Lin and Chu) and investigating potential long-run
    relationships using Pedroni's panel residual cointegration technique.
  10: Panel cointegration tests (Pedroni and Kao) are used to investigate the long-run
    relationship between lnAGR and other variables, allowing for cross-sectional dependence
    and heterogeneity. The analysis uses automatic lag length selection based on SIC
    with a max lag of 9. Significance is indicated at the 1% level.
  11: Panel econometric analysis using Pooled Mean Group (PMG), Mean Group (MG), and
    Dynamic Fixed Effects (DFE) estimators. Hausman tests were used to determine the
    most appropriate estimator. Results are applicable in the long run.
  12: The analysis uses panel data econometrics to model the dynamic relationship
    between agricultural productivity and climate-related variables. Three different
    estimators (PMG, MG, and DFE) are employed. The Hausman test is used to compare
    the consistency and efficiency of the estimators. The results are applicable to
    the specific countries and time period included in the dataset (Country=11, Observation=396).
More Notes:
  4: The study focuses on selected Asian countries.
  7: The MG model allows all coefficients to vary and be heterogeneous. The PMG model
    allows short-run coefficients to be heterogeneous but constrains long-run estimates.
    The DFE model assumes all slope coefficients are homogeneous.
  10: The specific variables other than lnAGR included in the model are not listed
    on this page. The analysis considers both models with and without a deterministic
    trend. The authors state that Panel-ADF and Group-ADF statistics are more reliable
    in a constant plus trend specification.

    \ 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively. The short-run coefficients are for the\
    \ change (\u2206) in the logged variables. The signs and significance of coefficients\
    \ vary across the different estimators."

    productivity by 1.94%; A 1% increase in temperature would cause to lower productivity
    by 2.28%; A 1% increase in rainfall increases productivity by 0.95%.
