Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change-induced natural disasters are the main shocks impacting outcomes.
  2: Natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and windstorms are key drivers
    of risk considered here.
  4: Shocks impacting outcomes include natural disasters such as floods, storms, droughts,
    wildfires, landslides, and extreme temperatures.
  5: "Frequency of disasters (wet and dry typologies), cumulative effect of repeated\
    \ exposure to extreme events, Oceanic Ni\xF1o Index (El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1\
    a)."
  6: Natural disasters, including dry and wet disasters, are mentioned as impacting
    socio-economic outcomes and necessitating public health expenditures.
  7: The analysis considers the number of natural disasters and socioeconomic variables,
    such as GDP per capita, that affect disaster impact.
  8: Increased inequality is a positive predictor of the number of people affected
    by natural disasters.
  9: "The paper identifies climatic and geographical factors as controls, specifically\
    \ mentioning El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a as influencing wet disasters."
  10: The study distinguishes between the impact of wet disasters (e.g., floods and
    storms) and dry disasters on income inequality.

Evaluation overview:
  1: Natural disasters lead to casualties, material deprivation, and altered power
    relations.
  2: This paper investigates the socio-economic impacts of natural disasters, including
    inequality, growth, and poverty.
  3: The paper evaluates the impact of natural disasters on physical damages (death
    toll and people affected) and income inequality.
  4: The paper does not provide a direct overview of specific outcomes like mortality
    or productivity loss. It provides data on the frequency and impact of natural
    disasters by various typologies and regions.
  5: Damages due to natural disasters, and income inequality (Gini coefficient).
  6: The paper provides an overview of the impact of natural disasters on physical
    damages, mortality, and socio-economic factors such as GDP and public expenditures.
  7: The study evaluates the magnitude of disasters and their relation to inequality
    (Gini index) and other socioeconomic factors.
  8: The paper evaluates the impact of inequality on the number of people affected
    by natural disasters.
  9: The paper examines the number of persons affected by various types of disasters
    normalized across different models.
  10: The paper evaluates the impact of various disasters on income inequality using
    the Gini index as a dependent variable.
  12: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: Higher levels of income inequality result in greater damages from natural disasters;
    inequality increases the number of people affected by disasters.
  2: Economies in recession may suffer less impact from natural disasters, which can
    act as a positive stimulus by mobilizing idle capacity.
  3: Unequal societies suffer greater physical damages due to natural disasters (Hypothesis
    1). Natural disasters increase income inequality (Hypothesis 2). Unequal societies
    suffer from a vulnerability-disaster trap whereby damages due to natural disasters
    further widen income inequality and further reduce resilience (Hypothesis 3).
    Floods were the most recurrent and devastating events between 1992 and 2018. Droughts,
    despite low frequency, rank second in terms of number of people hit. Latin America
    and the Caribbean are the regions mostly hit by (especially wet) disasters. Asia
    and Africa are the regions mostly affected by dry disasters.
  4: Asia has the highest frequency of natural disasters; floods affect the most people
    compared to other disaster types.
  5: Damages due to natural disasters will be harsher in unequal societies, and damages
    due to natural disasters lead to increased inequality.
  7: The Gini index and number of previous year disasters are robust predictors of
    the magnitude of impact from natural disasters.
  8: Increased inequality leads to a relative increase in the number of people affected
    by disasters, while societies with higher development and gender equality suffer
    less.
  9: "The study validates a vulnerability-disaster trap, showing that countries with\
    \ higher rural populations are more exposed to disaster impacts; La Ni\xF1a has\
    \ a positive effect on wet disasters."
  10: The analysis finds that wet disasters have a larger impact on income inequality
    than dry disasters, with ethnic marginalization particularly impacting income
    distribution in the case of repeated wet disasters.

Methodology:
  1: The paper uses a simultaneous equations approach on a panel of 149 countries
    from 1992 to 2018 to analyze the mechanisms connecting climate change-induced
    disasters and inequality.
  2: The paper discusses case studies based on quasi-experimental methods comparing
    growth and inequality before and after specific natural disaster events. It also
    discusses longitudinal studies on the effect of multiple disasters on poverty,
    growth, and inequality. The paper examines both short-term and long-term socio-economic
    impacts.
  3: The analysis is based on a panel database of 149 countries from 1992-2018. They
    test the simultaneous validity of the two causal relations discussed in the literature,
    the natural disasters affect inequality, and income distribution affects resilience
    to the damages caused by natural disasters. They formulate three hypotheses.
  4: The analysis uses data from EM-DAT and WDI, incorporating socioeconomic variables
    and gender inequality indices to explore disaster impacts and adaptation factors.
  5: Uses a Three-Stage Least Square (3SLS) estimator to analyze the relationship
    between damages due to natural disasters and income inequality. It uses a system
    of simultaneous equations.  The analysis uses panel data, controlling for current
    events, the cumulative number of past disasters, and continent dummies.
  6: The analysis considers endogeneity issues in relationships between socio-economic
    factors and disaster impacts, employing exogenous instruments such as distance
    from the Equator and value added in agriculture.
  7: The analysis involves a system of equations using socioeconomic variables as
    predictors and utilizes the Akaike Information Criterion for model fit.
  8: The analysis uses baseline models to evaluate hypotheses related to inequality
    and natural disaster impacts.
  9: The methodology includes regression models with dependent variables being the
    number of persons affected by disasters, categorized into dry and wet disasters,
    and includes factors like Gini, GDP, and climatic events.
  10: The study employs regression analysis to assess the relationship between disasters
    and income inequality, including lagged variables and interactions with GDP to
    examine non-linear effects.

More Notes:
  4: Socioeconomic variables and inequality are considered as factors affecting adaptation
    to disasters; the paper does not provide more specific actionable outcomes.
  5: Considers various country-based control variables, including surface area, rural
    population share, institutional quality (Worldwide Governance Indicators), and
    ethnic inequality (Ethnic Power Relations database).
  6: Data sources for analysis include EM-DAT, WDI, and other databases for contextual
    variables like GDP and population.
  9: The results suggest that economic inequality and rural population density are
    significant factors affecting disaster impacts.

Quantitative material:
  3: The dependent variable HIT is the sum of the death toll and the number of people
    affected by each disaster, standardized by the previous year's population. The
    measure of inequality is the Gini index. The database includes 149 countries over
    the period 1992-2018.
  4: Quantitative data includes the number of natural disasters and people affected
    by different types of disasters, as shown in the bar charts.
  5: None on this page.
  6: Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for various variables including normalized
    death toll, GDP per capita, and disaster frequency.
  7: The Gini Index has a coefficient of 0.003, indicating a significant relationship
    with the number of people hit by disasters.
  8: A 1% increase in the Gini index corresponds to 3.7% more people hit by natural
    disasters in countries at the 75th percentile compared to the 25th percentile.
  9: The table presents coefficients and significance levels for variables such as
    Gini, GDP per capita, and GNHDI across disaster types, indicating their impact
    on the number of affected persons.
  10: The analysis provides quantitative results such as the coefficients and significance
    levels of variables like GDP per capita, HDI, and public expenditure on income
    inequality, with specific statistical outputs (e.g., Gini index variances) detailed
    in Table 3b.
