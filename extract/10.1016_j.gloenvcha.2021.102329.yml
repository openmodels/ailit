Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change-induced natural disasters; Income inequality
  2: Marginalized ethnic groups, women, and those with health-related risks experience
    higher mortality and asset loss.
  3: Climate-related natural disasters (floods, landslides, storms, droughts, extreme
    temperatures, wildfires), Income inequality
  5: "Frequency of disasters (wet and dry typologies); Cumulative effect of repeated\
    \ exposure to extreme events; Oceanic Ni\xF1o Index (El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1\
    a); Ethnic inequality"
  7: "Natural disasters (number of disasters, stock of disasters), climate variables\
    \ (El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a), socioeconomic factors (GDP per capita, HDI), public\
    \ budget composition (public expenditure and investment), country characteristics\
    \ (land area, rural population), and social norms (quality of institutions, ethnic\
    \ marginalization) are considered as drivers of risk."
  8: Increased inequality predicted as a driver of more people affected by natural
    disasters due to unequal access to precaution and prevention measures as well
    as health services.
  10: Natural disasters (all disasters, dry disasters, wet disasters), GDP per capita,
    HDI (Human Development Index), public expenditure, institutional quality, ethnic
    marginalization, past shocks (wet events), cumulative frequency of disasters (Stock
    Disasters).
  11: Recurrent climate-related disasters and higher levels of inequality contribute
    to increased vulnerability and difficulty in recovery.
  13: Natural disasters and climate change impacts such as droughts, heatwaves, and
    sea-level rise (Kallis, 2008; Rosenzweig et al., 2008; Khan et al., 2011).
Highlights:
  1: Countries with higher income inequality suffer greater damages when hit by a
    natural disaster; Inequality is found to increase the number of people affected
    by disasters; A 'disaster-inequality trap' exists where repeated disasters exacerbate
    inequality, creating a vicious cycle.
  2: The relationship between economic development and disaster risk follows an inverted
    U-shape, with risk decreasing at later stages of development due to increased
    affordability of precautionary measures.
  3: 'Hypothesis 1: Unequal societies suffer greater physical damages due to natural
    disasters. Hypothesis 2: Natural disasters increase income inequality. Hypothesis
    3: Unequal societies suffer from a vulnerability-disaster trap whereby damages
    due to natural disasters further widen income inequality and further reduce resilience.'
  5: Damages due to natural disasters will be harsher in unequal societies; Natural
    disasters lead to increasing inequality; Governments forced to devote financial
    resources to natural disaster recovery efforts see prevention measures reduced,
    leading to higher damages and income inequality.
  7: The Gini index is found to be positively and significantly associated with the
    number of people hit by natural disasters. GDP per capita is negatively associated
    with the number of people hit by disasters. Public expenditure is positively associated
    with the number of people hit by disasters.
  8: Increased inequality leads to a rise in number of people affected by natural
    disasters and increases in inequality are linked with rising impacts from disasters.
  10: The impact of past shocks is statistically significant only for wet events,
    suggesting a vulnerability-disaster trap related to wet disasters and income inequality.
    Countries with higher income inequality experience a disproportionately larger
    impact from frequent disasters.
  11: The study finds that countries with higher inequality are more vulnerable to
    frequent extreme climatic events.
  13: Natural disasters have socioeconomic impacts, including poverty, development
    challenges, and welfare impacts (Sawada & Takasaki, 2017; Sakai et al., 2017).
Methodology:
  1: Simultaneous equations approach on a panel dataset to analyze the relationship
    between climate change-induced disasters, inequality, and vulnerability.
  3: "Panel data analysis of 149 countries over the period 1992\u20132018, using the\
    \ Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) and the Standardized World Income Inequality\
    \ Database (SWIID). The analysis tests three hypotheses related to the relationship\
    \ between natural disasters, income inequality, and vulnerability."
  5: "Simultaneous equations model using Three-Stage Least Square (3SLS) estimator\
    \ to address endogeneity between disaster damages and inequality; Controls for\
    \ frequency of current disasters, cumulative past disasters, continent dummies,\
    \ geographical dimension of climate (El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a), country-based\
    \ controls (surface area, rural population share), and social norms (institutional\
    \ quality, ethnic inequality)"
  7: The analysis uses a system of equations (equations 2 and 3) with country fixed
    effects and time fixed effects. It uses instrumental variables (distance from
    the Equator). Multicollinearity is tested using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
    General estimation fit is controlled with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
    and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) statistics.
  10: Panel data regression analysis examining the relationship between climatic and
    geographical controls and income inequality (Gini index) across countries. Models
    include various control variables like GDP per capita, HDI, public expenditure,
    institutional quality, and ethnic marginalization. They distinguish between 'all
    disasters', 'dry disasters', and 'wet disasters'.
  11: The analysis examined the relationship between climatic events and socioeconomic
    factors from 1992 to 2018.

More Notes:
  1: The study aims to disentangle the causal mechanisms between vulnerability to
    climate change-induced disasters and inequality, accounting for both directions
    of causality.
  3: The paper suggests a self-reinforcing dynamic where income inequality amplifies
    the magnitude of cumulative damages from repeated catastrophic events, and that
    disasters exacerbate income inequality. The literature review indicates that disasters
    are often treated as exceptional and independent events, which the authors aim
    to address by considering a wider array of disasters and a longer time horizon.
  5: The analysis considers the potential 'trap' of a permanent state of reconstruction;
    Institutional quality is linked to better resilience and adaptation capacity.
  10: The analysis considers the cumulative impact of past disasters and the interaction
    between income level and cumulative disaster frequency. The study acknowledges
    that marginalized ethnic groups are disproportionately affected by wet disasters.
    The study focuses on national level and acknowledges regional heterogeneities.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic damages from natural disasters; Inequality (measured by Gini index)
  2: Disasters can trigger armed conflicts, unrest, and mass outmigration.
  3: No relevant information
  5: Economic and physical damages due to catastrophic events; Income inequality
  7: The paper examines the impact of natural disasters on inequality (Gini index)
    and the drivers of the magnitude of disasters, measured by the number of people
    hit by natural disasters normalized by the country's population.
  10: Gini index (income inequality) is the dependent variable, representing a measure
    of macroeconomic outcome related to income distribution.
  13: The macroeconomic consequences of disasters are discussed (Noy, 2009).
Outcomes of Interest:
  11: The page primarily focuses on the vulnerability and inequality impacts of climate-related
    disasters rather than specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
Quantitative material:
  1: Panel data of 149 countries from 1992 to 2018
  3: "HIT variable = sum of death toll and people affected by each disaster, standardized\
    \ by previous year\u2019s population. Gini index for income inequality."
  5: Government final consumption expenditure (as % of GDP) as a proxy of ordinary
    management efforts; net investment in nonfinancial assets (as % of GDP) as a proxy
    of the attitude of the public sector to maintain and expand physical infrastructures;
    cumulative size of discriminated ethnic groups with respect to total population;
    ONI values; surface area of country
  7: Table 2a presents baseline regression models with the dependent variable being
    the normalized total number of persons hit by disasters, with coefficients and
    significance levels for various explanatory variables like the Gini index, GDP
    per capita, different HDI computations, public expenditure, number of disasters,
    land area, and rural population.
  8: A 1% increase in the Gini index in a country at the 75th percentile correlates
    with 3.7% more people affected by natural disasters compared to a country at the
    25th percentile.
