Highlights:
  1: "Potential future changes in daily extreme rainfall amounts due to climate change\
    \ are illustrated. Future scenarios project robust increases in these events during\
    \ some seasons for portions of the Midwest and Ohio Valley, whereas the southern\
    \ Great Plains are projected to experience decreases. A notable increase in the\
    \ variability of extreme daily precipitation across various CONUS cities by the\
    \ end of the twenty-\uFB01rst century."
  2: The model allows for the representation of regional climate change of precipitation
    extremes closer to the local scales at which they occur.
  5: HIST admirably represented the mean and 99th percentile of daily precipitation
    annually and seasonally compared to PRISM. Regional biases included significantly
    wetter conditions in a large area of the Intermountain West. Statistically significant
    wet biases were observed in the Intermountain West and northern Great Plains/Midwest
    during specific seasons.
  6: "Largest areas of statistically significant decreases in the 99th percentile\
    \ of daily precipitation in EOC8.5 were in the Southwest (March\u2013May) and\
    \ Intermountain West (June\u2013August)."
  7: "EOC8.5 seasonal mean precipitation in the Midwest and Ohio Valley had statistically\
    \ significant increases in March\u2013May. These regions also displayed widespread\
    \ robust statistically significant increases of up to 100% for the 99th percentile\
    \ of daily precipitation during September\u2013November."
  8: "Statistically significant increases in mean MCS precipitation are in the Northeast\
    \ into the Appalachian Mountains (June\u2013August), Ohio Valley (December\u2013\
    May), and Midwest (March\u2013May and September\u2013November). The 99th percentile\
    \ of daily precipitation displayed large areas of greater than 50% increase by\
    \ the end of the twenty-\uFB01rst century in all seasons except June\u2013August."
  9: Models tend to underestimate extreme values at the upper magnitudes in six out
    of eight cities studied.
  10: The model tends to underestimate the highest magnitude precipitation values.
    Reasonable model performance is observed for most other values. High correlation
    (Pearson's r > 0.9) is reported for modeled EVA compared to input data.
  11: The figure compares extreme value analysis (EVA) of daily precipitation from
    WRF model output against PRISM and HIST data (1990-2005) and future climate scenarios
    EOC4.5 and EOC8.5 (2085-2100) for eight cities.
  12: "Model shows potential for increased variability and a higher ceiling for precipitation\
    \ extremes by the end of the twenty-\uFB01rst century; Return period daily precipitation\
    \ values increased over HIST in one or both EOC scenarios for 25\u2013500 years;\
    \ The percent change above HIST in the EOC scenarios for the 100-yr return period\
    \ of daily precipitation values varied for each city but was generally 20% or\
    \ greater"

    intervals, for eight climatologically unique cities under historical and future
    climate scenarios.
  15: There were statistically significant increases in EOC8.5 for areas of the Intermountain
    West, Southwest, and Northeast. National averages for percent change in 100-yr
    return period precipitation values display an overall increasing trend with 18%
    in EOC4.5 and 119.4% in EOC8.5.
  16: "Results projected increasing values of extreme daily precipitation through\
    \ the end of the twenty-\uFB01rst century for both RCP scenarios in many regions\
    \ in the CONUS, such as the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, and Paci\uFB01c Northwest."

Methodology:
  1: "Dynamically downscaled, convection-permitting regional climate model to investigate\
    \ extreme daily precipitation in the CONUS, defined explicitly as the 99th percentile\
    \ 24-h accumulated value. Simulation output includes a historical (HIST) baseline\
    \ (1990\u20132005) and two epochs at the end of the twenty-first century (EOC;\
    \ 2085\u20132100) under intermediate and pessimistic emissions scenarios."
  2: The analysis uses dynamically downscaled convection-permitting simulation via
    WRF-ARW model with a 3.75 km horizontal grid spacing. Initial and lateral boundary
    conditions stemmed from the bias-corrected CESM GCM output. Spectral nudging was
    used at 6-h intervals for large-scale features.
  3: Analysis uses extreme value theory and generalized extreme value approach, specifically
    block maxima and peak over threshold methods, for defining and assessing extreme
    precipitation events.
  5: "The 99th percentile of daily precipitation for 1990\u20132005 from HIST (historical\
    \ data) and PRISM datasets are compared. Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine\
    \ statistically significant differences, with a field significance false discovery\
    \ rate of alpha = 0.1. RMSE and Pearson's r correlation are used for evaluation."
  6: "Compared HIST (historical) to potential future climate scenarios (EOC; 2085\u2013\

    \ with a block size of 1 year resulting in 15 values for eight climatologically\
    \ unique cities."
