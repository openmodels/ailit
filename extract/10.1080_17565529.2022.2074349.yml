  1: No relevant information
Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change damages both sectoral productivity and labour availability. Rising
    temperatures negatively impact working hours of low-skilled labour, especially
    among women, in high-exposure sectors.
  3: Temperature increases, climate-related disasters (floods, droughts)
  4: Increases in maximum weekly temperatures as a result of climate change.
  5: Changes in maximum weekly temperature.
  6: Maximum temperature, total precipitation
  7: Weekly maximum temperature, cumulative warming over a year.
  9: Climate change impacts on labor productivity, labor availability (e.g., due to
    temperature rise), and sectoral productivity (e.g., in agriculture).
  10: Climate change impacts on labour supply (considering four different RCP scenarios)
  11: Climate change, specifically considering different RCP scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5,
    RCP6.0, RCP8.5), and climate change damages to labour availability and sectoral
    productivity.
  12: Rising temperatures, though the study notes it only considers temperature impacts
    and not other climatic stressors like changes in precipitation patterns, droughts,
    or floods.
  14: Increase in mean temperature leading to a change in labor supply.
  15: Climate change impacts on productivity factors (Da and Db) in high-exposure
    and low-exposure sectors.
  16: Climate change impacts on labor supply (temperature effects) and sectoral productivity
    (temperature effects), specifically maximum temperature for labor supply and average
    temperature for sectoral productivity
Highlights:
  2: Climate-induced reduction in labour availability increases the relative wages
    of low-skilled female labour and reduces the wage gap between male and female
    labour in the high-exposure sector, and between high-skilled and low-skilled female
    labour, in general. However, overall climate change leads to a significant drop
    in output per adult.
  3: Climate change decreases the relative availability of female low-skilled labor;
    Closing the gender pay gap is likely to be compensated by the overall negative
    impact of climate change on economic output.
  4: The analysis finds significant gender-wage differences across exposure levels
    to climate impacts; labor supply is more responsive to weekly maximum temperatures
    than to weekly mean temperatures.
  5: Higher temperatures will likely have a greater adverse impact on female working
    hours compared to their male counterparts due to a lower optimal temperature for
    maximizing female labour supply. Labour supply in high-exposure sectors is more
    sensitive to temperature changes than in low-exposure sectors.
  6: Maximum temperature has a statistically significant (positive then negative due
    to quadratic term) impact on labor supply in both high and low exposure groups.
    Total precipitation's effect is statistically insignificant.
  7: Higher temperatures negatively impact labour supply, with greater negative impacts
    on female labour supply in both low and high-skilled sectors. Additional days
    of maximum temperature in the bins below the reference bin increases labour supply.
    Additional days in the bins in the higher temperature level bins result in a decrease
    in labour supply.
  9: Climate change damages to labor supply and demand have different implications
    for wage inequality and gender pay gap. Long-term wage inequality is driven by
    damages to labor availability, while short-term wage shocks can be attributed
    to both damages to labor availability and sectoral productivity. Climate change
    impact on labor productivity in one sector affects labor reallocation and wage
    adjustments in other sectors.
  10: Climate change is projected to impact the gender pay gap, particularly affecting
    low-skilled female labour. Under RCP scenarios, the wage gap between high-skilled
    and low-skilled labour decreases for both genders, but is more noticeable among
    female workers.
  11: Climate change damages to labour availability increase the relative wages of
    low-skilled labour and close the wage gap between male and female labour in the
    high-exposure sector; climate change can have very different outcomes for skill
    ratio and wage gap; the overall impact of climate change on the economy remains
    negative despite potential pay gap reduction.
  12: Highlights the importance of targeted adaptation policies to build on the positive
    impacts of climate change in reducing the gender pay gap in rural communities.
  14: Labor supply is affected by deviations from optimal temperature, resulting in
    decreased economic production.
  16: Climate change impacts both the supply of and the demand for labor. Maximum
    temperatures are significant factors for labor supply, while average temperature
    is a better proxy for damages on labor demand.
Methodology:
  2: A structural model is developed and calibrated with empirical evidence on the
    impacts of increasing temperatures on labour availability in two general economic
    sectors. Five waves of nationally representative micro-survey data in South Africa
    from 2008 to 2017 are used. An overlapping generations (OLG) model is used.
  3: Empirical analysis of South African household survey data (2008-2017); Development
    of an overlapping generations (OLG) model; Calibration of damage functions to
    empirical findings; Projection under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2) and Representative
    Concentration Pathways (RCPs).
  4: Econometric analysis using a longitudinal survey dataset from South Africa (NIDS)
    to assess the impact of weekly maximum temperature on labor supply, using a truncated
    Poisson model and panel data methods.
  5: Econometric analysis using a regression model to determine the impact of temperature
    on labour supply, calibrated into an Overlapping Generations (OLG) model. Marginal
    effects of temperature change on labour supply are calculated as the first derivative
    of weekly hours worked with respect to weekly temperature. Robustness tests include
    differentiating by exposure level of the sector and using a log specification
    of hours worked.
  6: Regression analysis with controls for age, marital status, education, health
    condition, log of income, maximum temperature (and its square), and total precipitation.
    Separate regressions are run for high-exposure and low-exposure groups, and within
    each group, separately for males and females. Fixed effects for household, week,
    and year-season are included.
  7: OLS regressions, two-stage least squares (2SLS), controls for maximum weekly
    temperature (and its second-degree polynomial), age (and its second-degree polynomial),
    gender, education level, health condition, total household income (and its second-degree
    polynomial) and household, week and year-season fixed-effects. Cumulative precipitation
    in the 12 months before the interview is used as an exogenous instrument in the
    2SLS.
  9: Overlapping Generations (OLG) model is used to calculate the number of high-skilled
    and low-skilled children of each gender for the next generation, based on future
    climate change projections and predicted wage differences. Wage dynamics are modeled
    based on child-rearing cost ratios and the ratio of damages to labor availability.
  10: 'The analysis develops two cases: a Reference case with unchanged climate conditions
    and a climate change case considering four RCP scenarios. It examines the effect
    of these scenarios on labour supply and wage differences, using empirical results
    and equations (A4) and (A5) from the appendix.  It is applicable to South Africa.'
  11: Calibrated OLG (Overlapping Generations) model based on empirical evidence to
    study the impact of climate and socioeconomic changes on gender pay gap; nationally
    representative longitudinal survey with household characteristics and labour information
    to gain empirical insight.
  12: The analysis considers the impact of climate change on human systems using stochastic
    modeling for integrated assessment models of climate change and economy; it uses
    a CES production function to account for the positive elasticity of substitution
    between male and female labour.
  14: Theoretical model assumes non-linear effects of temperature on labor supply,
    differentiated by skill and gender, informed by empirical survey data.
  15: Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model with CES production and utility functions.
    The model incorporates climate change impacts on labor productivity and allows
    for adjustments in labor allocation between sectors and genders. The model considers
    a linear production function that captures the fact that the high-exposure sector
    is relatively less skill-intensive.
  16: A dynamic general equilibrium model is used, calibrated to South African data,
    to simulate the impact of climate change on labor supply, sectoral productivity,
    and wages. The model uses RCP scenarios for future temperature projections and
    SSP2 projections for skill ratios. It calibrates to initial conditions in the
    year 2000 and projects forward. The impacts are channeled through variations in
    climate indicators.
More Notes:
  3: The paper focuses on the case of South Africa and models the gender impact of
    climate change similarly to other external shocks like war, but highlights key
    differences (e.g., male vs. female labor decline).
  5: The study focuses on labour supply, not equilibrium effects in terms of wage
    adjustments. The analysis does not consider unemployment as an alternative to
    decreased working hours. The grey shaded area shows the range of projected increases
    in maximum temperature under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios in South Africa. The
    estimates of productivity loss in each sector (Desmet & Rossi-Hansberg 2015) are
    used to account for the indirect effect of climate change on labour supply in
    the theoretical modelling.
  6: The table shows the impact of climate variables and other socio-economic factors
    on labor supply. The regressions are performed separately for high and low exposure
    groups based on gender, and the impact of maximum temperature is modeled as a
    quadratic function. The sample sizes for some regressions are much smaller (e.g.,
    n=1372).
  7: Analysis differentiates impacts on high-exposure and low-exposure sectors. Analysis
    uses South African data.
  9: The model considers indirect (general equilibrium) effects of climate change
    on the labor market. The analysis uses Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)
    and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to project climate and socioeconomic
    changes.
  10: The analysis focuses on the impact of climate change on relative labour supply
    and the resulting wage ratios and gender pay gap in South Africa.
  11: The model assumes a clear labour division between high-exposure (agriculture,
    low-skilled labour) and low-exposure (manufacturing, high-skilled labour) sectors;
    the study does not account for potential impacts of future gender pay equalizing
    policies.
  12: The study focuses on South Africa and Uganda; mentions that gender roles play
    a central role in implementing successful adaptation strategies; and that research
    contributes to advancing knowledge on socioeconomic impacts of climate change,
    identifying hotspots and vulnerable populations, and supporting the design of
    tailored policies to mitigate and adapt to these impacts.
  16: "The analysis focuses on the South African context and uses specific temperature\
    \ thresholds (21.1\xB0C and 17.4\xB0C) for productivity peaks in different sectors."
