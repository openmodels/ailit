Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme weather events, climate and weather forecasts, false alarms.
  2: Science-based early warnings of potential disasters (e.g., storms, cyclones,
    floods, droughts).
  5: Forecast accuracy, the probability threshold (p) used to trigger action, and
    the potential for disasters.
  8: Forecast skill, hazard type, geographical scale, uncertainty in probability estimates,
    uncertainty in cost estimates, risk perception, lack of historical disaster data,
    interaction effects between short-term and long-term investments.
Highlights:
  1: Forecast-based financing can improve effectiveness at reducing the risk of disaster.
  2: The current humanitarian funding landscape does not sufficiently use the window
    of heightened risk between early warning and disaster materialization, where short-term
    activities can provide a large return on investment.
  5: Forecast-based financing can be economically beneficial if the actions triggered
    by forecasts reduce overall losses compared to a scenario with no action, taking
    into account the costs of both acting correctly and acting in vain. Actions should
    satisfy condition (2).
  8: Forecast-based financing systems must be designed for a specific hazard at a
    specific geographical scale. Standard operating procedures developed in one area
    are unlikely to have value if applied indiscriminately elsewhere. The framework
    quantifies the value of acting early to donor agencies.
Methodology:
  1: Proposes a forecast-based financing system to automatically trigger action based
    on climate forecasts or observations, matching threshold forecast probabilities
    with appropriate actions, disbursing funding when threshold forecasts are issued,
    and developing standard operating procedures.
  2: Forecast-based financing model for the development of procedures to act based
    on probabilistic warnings.
  5: The paper uses a 2x2 contingency table (Table 2) to evaluate forecasts at different
    probability thresholds (p). It calculates the correct alarm ratio R(p) and uses
    this, along with costs and losses (Table 3), to determine whether forecast-based
    action is worthwhile. Actions are considered worthwhile if the losses in a business-as-usual
    scenario exceed the combined costs and losses in a scenario with forecast-based
    action.
  8: Probabilistic benefit/cost ratio assessment based on forecasted rainfall and
    hydrological estimates, sensitivity analyses of cost and probability estimates.
More Notes:
  2: Early action based on forecasts is not always implemented because the financing
    for it is not available.
  8: The paper suggests incorporating a 'risk perception' factor into the B/C calculation
    to account for changes in response to false alarms or successful interventions.
    The lack of historical disaster data will pose constraints, and the impact of
    uncertainty in probability estimates needs to be assessed.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Avoided disaster losses.
  2: Return on investment of short-term disaster risk reduction activities.
  5: Economic consequences of acting in vain vs. taking worthwhile action based on
    forecasts. Costs (C) and losses (L) are considered in a contingency table based
    on whether forecast-based action was taken and whether a disaster occurred. The
    paper also considers the cost of acting in vain (1C), which includes reputational
    risk and the cost of dismantling preparations.
  8: Benefit-cost ratios (B/C) for forecast-based financing schemes, marginal benefit
    of additional funding spent in disaster risk reduction and preparedness, potential
    of forecast-based financing across regions and hazards.
Quantitative material:
  1: Avoided disaster losses can at least double or quadruple the investment in risk
    reduction.
  2: 12% of funding in the last 20 years was invested in reducing the risk of disaster
    before it happens; the rest was spent on emergency response, reconstruction, and
    rehabilitation.
  5: 'Equation (2) provides a mathematical condition for worthwhile actions: L * a(p)
    > C * (a(p) + b(p)) + 1C * b(p) + L * c(p) where a, b, and c represent the number
    of hits, false alarms, and misses, respectively, and L, C, and 1C are losses,
    costs, and additional costs, respectively.'
  8: Equation (6) presents a formula for calculating the benefit-cost ratio (B/C)
    of forecast-based financing, though not corrected for discount rate.
