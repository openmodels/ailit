Drivers of Risk:
  1: Insufficient water resources, degraded water quality (pollution), climate change
    stressing freshwater resources and widening the gap between water supply and demand,
    legacy of supply-driven water management policies.
  6: Water scarcity due to climate change (CC).
  10: Water scarcity and pollution combined with increasing demands from rapid social
    and economic growth.
  18: Increases in water demand for non-agricultural uses (greater impact than climate
    change); climate change (smaller impact on water availability for agriculture
    compared to socio-economic development); uncertainty in water supply.
  19: Climate change impacting water resources; difficulties in implementing IWRM;
    socio-political landscape; pollution further intensifying water shortages; impact
    of climate change on hydropower and increased energy needs for water transfer
    and treatment.
  20: Climate change impacts on water availability, quality, and demand.
Highlights:
  1: China needs a sustainable water resources management strategy based on both supply-
    and demand-side management options to meet the demands of economic development,
    social well-being, and ecosystem conservation in the context of global climate
    change.
  6: No relevant information
  10: China's water resource scarcity and pollution present challenges for its development
    and global sustainable development.
  18: The impacts of climate change on water availability for agriculture are small
    compared to the role of socio-economic development.
  19: Adaptation to climate change in China involves demand management, water pollution
    control, and addressing energy challenges related to water resources.
  20: Effective water demand management can help China cope with the impacts of climate
    change on water resources.
Methodology:
  1: Historical perspective on water resources management policies and practices in
    China; recommends demand management and pollution control as adaptation measures.
  6: No relevant information
  18: Models integrated with climate change and socio-economic scenarios were used
    to study the potential impacts of climate change and socio-economic development
    on agricultural water availability in China.
  19: No specific methodology or timing of results applicable is provided on this
    page.
More Notes:
  6: The page discusses water management strategies (water reallocation, development
    of water markets, dam construction and desalination) as potential adaptation measures
    to climate change-induced water scarcity. The information focuses on the supply-side
    aspect of water demand management, and mentions the current status and expansion
    of water infrastructure in the context of climate change adaptation. Specific
    quantitative data is included related to water infrastructure. The context and
    location for this information is limited - other than a mention of China, there
    is no specific region, making it difficult to extrapolate this to other countries.
  18: China has been actively mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change
    on water resources over the past decade. Adaptive management measures have been
    proposed, including demand management, incorporating climate change into planning,
    infrastructure construction, and strengthening water resources protection.
  19: Recommendations focus on shifting from supply-driven to demand-driven water
    management, incorporating climate change into planning.
  20: Poor water resources management increases China's vulnerability and intensifies
    water shortages.

  11: This page primarily discusses the political-economic system and water resource
    management structure in China, without providing specific information on macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal risks of climate change, costs/benefits of adaptation, or quantitative
    economic outcomes.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Impacts on economic development, social well-being, and ecosystem conservation
    due to water scarcity exacerbated by climate change.
  6: No relevant information
  10: Water scarcity could limit China's further development and sustainability, which
    in turn could threaten global sustainable development and worldwide impacts if
    China cannot produce enough food for its population.
  18: Insufficient water for agriculture in China in the coming decades.
  19: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes are mentioned on this page.
