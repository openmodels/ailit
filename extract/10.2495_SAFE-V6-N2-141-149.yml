Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (extreme rainfall increase, sea level rise), population growth,
    and insured value growth in areas at risk.
  2: Extreme rainfall, sea-level rise. Climate change leading to increased frequency
    and intensity of catastrophic events.
  3: "The paper considers climate change scenario RCP 4.5, which projects a 1.8\xB0\
    C mean temperature increase by 2100, and simulates floods based on rainfall measurements\
    \ and sea level rise. It also considers storm surges and sea level rise of up\
    \ to 20cm by 2050."
  5: Storm surge, rainfall events (72-hour and 10-day), rising tide levels, atmospheric
    pressure, wind speed, population growth, and territorial dynamics.
  6: Runoff is expected to increase in certain areas due to changing climate conditions,
    and storm surge impacts are exacerbated by predicted sea-level rise.
  7: Meteorological conditions (flooding, storm surge), vulnerability conditions,
    and sea level rise.
  8: Global increase of precipitations, demographic evolution (population growth in
    southern and coastal regions), sea level rise, and rise of insured good values.
Highlights:
  1: Global loss increase in 2050 is attributable to climatic factors, population
    growth, and insured value growth.
  2: The study simulates climate conditions for the present (2000) and future (2050)
    to estimate insured losses.
  5: A single fictive event in 2003 (at climate 2050) could cause over one billion
    in losses from continental flooding and 100 million from coastal flooding. The
    number of insured properties is projected to increase by 11.7% by 2050.
  6: There are major regional disparities in the growth of insured values; climate
    change will cause an extension of areas exposed to runoff; a 20 cm increase in
    sea level leads to a significant extension of flooded areas in low-relief areas.
  7: "The paper projects increased mean annual insurance losses due to flooding, storm\
    \ surge, and multi-hazard events under climate change scenarios, highlighting\
    \ the importance of considering vulnerability and sea level rise in risk assessment.\
    \ Specific locations such as Carnac, Beuamer and L\xE9gendes are highlighted as\
    \ increasingly vulnerable. The median loss for flooding is projected to be substantially\
    \ higher than for storm surge, and multi-hazard events are expected to increase\
    \ losses compared to current levels."
  8: "The annual amount of damages generated by both flood and storm surge will rise\
    \ from 855 to 1325 M\u20AC (~+55%) from now to 2050, with ~20% due to climate\
    \ change."
Methodology:
  1: "Stochastic approach developed since 2011 for flood, storm surge and drought.\
    \ Uses climate simulations from ARPEGE-Climate (M\xE9t\xE9o-France) under RCP\
    \ 4.5 to generate hourly atmospheric time series for current conditions and 2050\
    \ conditions. Hazard and vulnerability models are used to compute continuous loss\
    \ estimations, considering development scenarios."
  2: "Combines CCR's hazard and damage models with climatic projections generated\
    \ by M\xE9t\xE9o-France's ARPEGE-Climate model. The ARPEGE-Climate model uses\
    \ simulations up to 2100 for different greenhouse gas concentration trajectories\
    \ (RCPs). Focuses on multi-peril approach (flood and storm surge)."
  3: The paper uses a flood model developed by CCR made up of a surface run-off model
    and a river overflow model which estimate flow rates of water courses during an
    extreme event. It uses a coastal flooding model based on the combination of the
    TELEMAC-2D hydrodynamic model, the TOMAWAC model and a flooding model similar
    to LISFLOOD-FP. Continental and coastal flood hazard maps are crossed with a vulnerability
    database.
  5: Flood hazard is modelled at small watershed and large watershed scales for 72-hour
    and 10-day rainfall events, using 10-year return period thresholds. Coastal flood
    events are detected using thresholds based on tide predictions (OSU Tidal Prediction
    Software), atmospheric pressure, and wind speed, calibrated with historical events.
    The vulnerability assessment projects the number of insured properties at the
    commune level based on INSEE projections.
  6: The analysis uses CCR historical insurance database over the past 10 years to
    extrapolate variations in insured values between 2015 and 2050; probabilistic
    hazard maps are built using event sets to indicate the return period of flooding.
  7: The analysis uses box plots to display the distribution of potential financial
    losses under various climate change scenarios and vulnerability conditions. The
    results are applicable to France and specifically estimate losses for a 50-year
    return period.
  8: Simulation of continental and coastal flood hazard and damages at an infra-communal
    scale under RCP 4.5 scenario. Insurance portfolio projections are used to estimate
    the mean cost of events.
More Notes:
  1: The model uses hourly rainfall, wind speed, atmospheric pressure and Soil Wetness
    Index. The model covers flood, storm surge and drought. The model is calibrated
    and validated using a policy and claim database created in 2003.
  5: The study focuses on France, specifically the west part affected by the fictive
    event. The analysis is based on simulations and projections for the 2050 climate.
  6: The model does not account for the consequences of vulnerability rise, prevention
    and protection measures, or erosion and accretion.
  7: The paper focuses on the impact of runoff and coastal flooding on regions along
    the Atlantic Ocean coast in France. The '2050.Vul' scenario likely refers to a
    scenario where vulnerability is reduced, but the explanation of what changes in
    'vulnerability' entails is not further specified. The sea level rise is specified
    as +20 cm for the runoff/flooding maps.
  8: The study acknowledges that the choice of the RCP 4.5 scenario may impact the
    results and plans to simulate RCP 6.0 in the next phase of the project. The impact
    of a 20 cm sea level rise on damages is significant for storm surge, but vulnerability
    is the greatest driver of estimated costs in 2050

    losses.
  5: Economic costs associated with flooding events, specifically losses due to continental
    and coastal flooding.
  6: Insured values are estimated to grow by 72% between 2015 and 2050.
  7: Mean annual insurance losses in million euros.
  8: Insured losses due to climatic disasters (flood and storm surge).
Quantitative material:
  1: Simulations show a global loss increase in 2050.
  2: Simulating 200 fictive years corresponding to actual and 2050 climatic conditions
    to estimate insured losses resulting from flood and storm surge.
  5: More than one billion in losses for continental flooding from a 2003 fictive
    event at climate 2050. 100 million in losses for coastal flooding from a 2003
    fictive event at climate 2050. An increase in the number of insured properties
    from nearly 51 million in 2015 to almost 57 million in 2050 (+11.7%).
  6: Insured values would grow by 72% between 2015 and 2050.
  7: Projected mean annual insurance losses under different scenarios (Actual, 2050,
    2050.Vul, 2050.SLR) for flooding, storm surge, and multi-hazard events, including
    median loss values and interquartile ranges for each scenario.
  8: "Damages from floods are projected to increase by 20% between the current climate\
    \ and 2050. Annual amount of damages generated by both flood and storm surge will\
    \ rise from 855 to 1325 M\u20AC (~+55%). Increase of precipitations or rise of\
    \ sea level will play a smaller part (~20%) in the global increase."
