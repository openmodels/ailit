  2: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  2: Continued emissions of greenhouse gases leading to changes in land suitability
    and crop yields; Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events (cyclones,
    floods, hailstorms, droughts); Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations.
  3: Changing climatic conditions initiating a vicious circle where infectious disease
    causes or compounds hunger, which in turn makes affected populations more susceptible
    to infectious disease.
  4: Climate change, socio-economic development paths, and the effect of elevated
    CO2 on crops.
  5: Climate change, socio-economic development paths (population growth, economic
    growth), competition with bio-energy, frequency of extreme events, abrupt climate
    or socio-economic change, food safety and vulnerability (stability).
  6: Climate change affects food availability, access to food, stability of food supplies,
    and food utilization.
Highlights:
  2: Under climate change, the biggest losses in suitable cropland are likely to be
    in Africa, whereas the largest expansion of suitable cropland is in the Russian
    Federation and Central Asia.
  3: The poorest and already most food-insecure region, sub-Saharan Africa, is expected
    to suffer the largest contraction of agricultural incomes due to climate change.
  4: Climate change is likely to increase the number of people at risk of hunger compared
    with reference scenarios without climate change; the exact impacts strongly depend
    on the projected socio-economic developments.
  5: Socio-economic development paths are likely to top the effects of climate change
    on future food security. Sub-Saharan Africa is likely to surpass Asia as the most
    food-insecure region, largely independent of climate change and more the result
    of socio-economic development paths assumed for the different developing regions
    in the SRES scenarios. Climate change with CO2 fertilization would reduce the
    number of undernourished by 2080, but less than if there was no CO2 fertilization
    effect.
  6: Developing countries will become more dependent on imports due to climate change,
    especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
Methodology:
  2: Estimates implicitly include adaptation using available management techniques
    and crops, but excluding new cultivars from breeding or biotechnology.
  4: 'The analysis uses two crop modeling systems: AEZ and DSSAT (Decision Support
    System for Agrotechnology Transfer), each coupled to the same economic and food
    trade model, BLS (Basic Linked System). These models are calibrated to give 824
    million undernourished people in 2000, according to FAO data. Results presented
    include the combined effects of climate change and elevated CO2 on crops, unless
    otherwise specified.'
  5: The paper reviews existing global assessments of climate change and food security,
    largely based on the FAO/IIASA AEZ model and the IIASA BLS system, combined with
    various GCM models and SRES scenarios. Results are applicable until 2080, as this
    is the timeframe of the scenarios reviewed.
  6: The quantitative assessments reviewed consider the first and second halves of
    the 21st century, accounting for biophysical changes and socio-economic status.
More Notes:
  4: The SR ES A2 scenario would imply a price increase in real cereal prices by 15-170%.
    The (additional) price increase caused by climate change (in the Hadley Centre
    Coupled Model, version 3, climate change case) would only be 14.4%.
  5: The existing assessments focus on food availability and access, without quantification
    of food safety and vulnerability. They also exclude impacts of sea-level rise
    and reductions of marine/freshwater fish production. Results depend on GCM scenarios
    and are therefore highly uncertain, especially outside of Sub-Saharan Africa.
    The paper notes the need for continued and enhanced validation efforts of both
    the agro-climatological and food trade tools developed at IIASA.
  6: The socio-economic environment and policy environment is more important than
    the biophysical changes of climate change regarding food security.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Substantial decline in labor productivity, increase in poverty and even mortality
    due to climate change and food insecurity.
  4: Number of people at risk of hunger in developing countries.
  5: The paper focuses on food security, specifically the number of undernourished
    people, as the primary outcome related to climate change impacts and socio-economic
    development.
  6: Climate change will adversely affect food security, which can be linked to macroeconomic
    outcomes via productivity and trade.
Quantitative material:
  2: Crop yields increase at 550 ppm CO2 in the range of 10% to 20% for C3 crops and
    only 0-10% for C4 crops.
  3: "Losses in agricultural GDP for sub-Saharan Africa range from 2% to 8% with Hadley\
    \ Centre Coupled Model, version 3 and 7\u20139% for the Commonwealth Scientific\
    \ and Industrial Research Organisation projections (compared with no climate change)."
  4: Table 1 provides quantitative estimates of the number of people at risk of hunger
    in developing countries in millions for the years 2020, 2050, and 2080 under different
    scenarios (A1, A2, B1, B2) with and without climate change (CC) and CO2 effects,
    using AEZ-BLS and DSSAT-BLS models.
  5: Estimates reductions of 110 million to 700 million people undernourished in developing
    countries by 2080 under scenarios A1, B1, and B2, from a baseline of 820 million
    currently undernourished. Scenario A2 forecasts only a slight decrease in the
    number of hungry.
  6: All quantitative assessments reviewed show that climate change will adversely
    affect food security.
