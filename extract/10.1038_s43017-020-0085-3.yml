Drivers of Risk:
  2: Anthropogenic climate change is altering precipitation patterns and increasing
    temperatures, resulting in more frequent extreme vegetation-fire events.
  3: Climate change and anthropogenic drivers influence global fire activity. Drought
    and fuel dryness are associated with extreme fire events.
  4: Warmer, drier summers and earlier spring snowmelt increase the area burned from
    vegetation fires.
  5: Analysis considers the increase in fire-prone conditions as indicated by the
    Fire Weather Index (FWI) exceeding the local 95th percentile.
  6: "Anthropogenic climate change, drought, high temperatures, vegetation changes\
    \ (agriculture, invasive species), lightning activity, deforestation, El Ni\xF1\
    o-Southern Oscillation"
  7: Changes in fire weather index, related to changes in global mean temperatures.
  8: Fossil-fuel emissions, urban heat islands, altered surface albedo, drought stress,
    altered surface albedo, post-colonial anthropogenic change, land-use change, land-cover
    change, invasive species, removal of grazers, indigenous/cultural fire removal,
    fire suppression, WUI expansion, fuel alteration, increased fire-disaster ignitions.
  9: Climate change (worsening fire weather, hot/dry conditions, elevated atmospheric
    CO2), vegetation changes (abundance of flammable plants, forest type shifts, tree/shrub
    invasion), anthropogenic factors (logging, deforestation, fire suppression, human
    ignitions), drought, extreme fire events, and the interactions and feedbacks between
    these factors.
  10: Direct flame, radiant heat, convective heat, ember cast, smoke (particulates/aerosols)
    are drivers of risk, varying by distance from the fire.
  11: Climate change is mentioned as shrinking safe weather windows for prescribed
    burning and affecting fire regimes. The growth of urban populations and expansion
    of the WUI are also drivers of risk. Human ignitions, ineffective fuel treatments,
    and poor planning contribute to fire risk.
  12: Changing climate, land-use patterns
  13: Anthropogenic fire regimes influenced by human activity; challenges in wildfire
    adaptation due to climate change and socio-economic factors.
Evaluation overview:
  2: Economic impacts affecting life, property, and human health are mentioned in
    connection with major fire disasters.
  3: The page discusses the impact of vegetation fires on various aspects of the Earth
    system, including the biosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, and atmosphere,
    although it does not specify how this is being evaluated.
  4: No relevant information
  5: Analysis of vegetation-fire activity trends globally, specifically in terms of
    fire emissions and burned areas across various regions including Western USA.
  6: The page focuses on fire activity, specifically frequency, severity, fire-season
    length, burned area and fire occurrence.
  7: Fire activity, burned area, fire weather, and fire impacts are evaluated.
  8: No relevant information
  9: This page evaluates the impacts of future fire regimes on landscapes and ecosystems.
  10: No relevant information
  11: The page discusses health impacts (death and hospitalization) from biomass smoke
    pollution from wildfires and prescribed burns. It also mentions firefighting expenditures
    and structural losses in the wildland-urban interface (WUI).
  12: The flammability of many landscapes is increasing because of the combined effects
    of changing climate and land-use patterns; Increased risk of economically and
    ecologically destructive fires can be reduced using planning and urban design
    principles, combined with fuel management and fire management
  13: Provides insights into necessary research areas for addressing wildfire impacts
    and fire management strategies.
Highlights:
  2: Large and frequent fires in boreal and tropical forests have the potential to
    cause terrestrial carbon stores to become major greenhouse gas sources, amplifying
    climate change.
  3: Extreme fire events are characterized by anomalous fire behavior, including extremely
    high energy releases, very rapid rate of spread, massive emission of smoke and
    greenhouse gas pollution, and prolonged duration. Global fire activity is influenced
    by regional-scale variation, climate change, and anthropogenic drivers. Area burned
    decreased by 25% from 1998-2015.
  4: The western USA and boreal Canada are the most well-studied regions for fire
    activity trends.
  5: Significant analysis of trends in burned areas and fire emissions in various
    regions, including Western USA and Canada.
  6: Frequency or severity of fire weather, fire-season length, burned area, and fire
    occurrence are generally increasing globally with future climate change, although
    some regions are suggested to have no change or decreases in fire activity due
    to human influence. Lightning ignitions are increasing. It also highlights the
    importance of considering factors other than climate change, like vegetation changes
    and land use.
  7: "The boreal zone of Canada is expected to experience a doubling of burned area\
    \ by the end of the century, increasing to 5 Mha year\u22121."
  8: Wildfire activity is projected to increase, but there are uncertainties due to
    complex feedbacks in the Earth system and difficulty representing human behavior
    in models. Climate change may overwrite human influences on fire regimes.
  9: Climate change, vegetation and fire could drive a runaway feedback process, potentially
    transforming entire landscapes as fire frequency increases. Ecosystems on the
    fringe of bioclimatic niches (such as lower tree line forests) and vegetation
    persisting in climate or fire refugia are particularly vulnerable to transformative
    fire regimes. Landscape-wide conversions from forests to grasslands and shrublands
    are possible, depleting soil carbon stores. Negative fire-vegetation feedbacks
    are suggested to limit the extent of projected increases in burned area. Extreme
    fire events pose a significant challenge to predictions and can lead to cascading
    consequences.
  10: Sustainable fire management demands careful fuel management to conserve biodiversity,
    sustain ecosystem services, and reduce wildfire risk.
  11: Prescribed burning has limitations due to climate change and may cause significant
    smoke pollution, potentially exceeding the health impact of the wildfires it aims
    to mitigate. Fire management should incorporate indigenous and local knowledge.
    Real-time smoke information apps can help individuals manage wildfire risks. The
    vulnerability of housing in the WUI reflects socio-ecological factors amplifying
    fire risk.
  12: Flammability of landscapes is increasing due to climate change and land use
    patterns; Fire management can reduce emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases, like
    methane and nitrous oxide, with examples from Australia; Deforestation fires release
    significant amounts of stored carbon; Boreal forest fires emit greenhouse gases
    and create smoke that crosses international boundaries; Large-scale tree planting
    must have effective and sustainable fire management; Extreme fire behaviours exhibit
    unusual characteristics, such as pyro-tornadoes
  13: Stresses need for integrated dynamic feedback processes across Earth systems
    to predict fire outcomes and effectiveness of fire management.
Methodology:
  2: The review describes how human-environmental interaction shapes fire activity
    from the viewpoint of pyrogeography.
  3: The analysis relies on satellite observations (early satellite observations are
    spatially coarse and have imperfect coverage), the MODIS burned area record, and
    regional-scale variation in fire activity.
  4: Regional analyses are essential to reconstruct contemporary fire-activity trends.
  5: Utilizes data from ERA5, historical reconstructions, Monitoring Trends in Burn
    Severity (MTBS) data, and MODIS for evaluating fire trends and emissions.
  6: The page mentions both process-based coupled Earth System Models and statistical
    approaches (environmental-niche modeling) to model future changes in global fire
    activity.
  7: "The summary is based on selected global, biome, and regional studies. The median\
    \ change in Fire Weather Index is calculated from 17 climate models corresponding\
    \ with global mean temperatures 2 \xB0C above pre- industrial levels versus 1981\u2013\
    2010."
  8: The paper discusses both statistical association between climate variables and
    area burned, and process-based mechanistic modeling incorporating climate, CO2,
    vegetation and fire.
  9: This page discusses modeling future fire regimes, comparing different model outputs
    and observed patterns in area burned. It identifies limitations in current models
    and uncertainties due to complex interactions. The results are applicable to future
    climate scenarios.
  10: Adaptation and management approaches should be tailored to specific environmental
    and socio-ecological settings in flammable landscapes and the wildland-urban interface.
  12: Careful monitoring and evaluation are required to ensure that managed fire regimes
    do not have unwanted ecological side effects; Fire regime quantification needs
    determination of how patterns are shaped by climate, terrain and vegetation; Identifying
    the cause of fires, at the most basic level differentiating natural and anthropogenic
    ignitions, is also essential; The Global Fire Atlas will provide a central repository
    on remote sensing of individual fires and their location
  13: Emphasizes the need for transdisciplinary, applied research co-designed by communities
    and various agencies.
More Notes:
  2: Detecting and predicting changes in fire activity is difficult due to relatively
    brief fire records, bioregional variability, and human involvement.
  3: The page emphasizes the importance of regional-scale analyses due to substantial
    variation in fire activity amongst biomes.
  4: The paper notes that a focus solely on area burned does not adequately capture
    trends in the changing risk of economically destructive fire events.
  7: Studies include those from Jones et al.223 and other studies discussed in the
    text (marked witha). Regional studies are summarized by continent and sub-geographic
    region or country.
  8: Figure 4 illustrates relationships and feedbacks between climate, fire, and vegetation.
  9: The paper emphasizes the importance of adaptation and effective management of
    fire regimes to promote environmental sustainability and reduce greenhouse gas
    emissions.
  10: Fuel management can involve broad-scale prescribed burning, but requires frequent
    application and treatment of large areas to be effective.
  12: Managed fire regimes can have unwanted socio-ecological side effects, such as
    harming biodiversity, promoting a grass-fire cycle with declines in above-ground
    carbon storage due to increased tree mortality or disempowering indigenous communities;
    Reducing boreal forest fire requires a multipronged and international approach,
    which involves reducing accidental human ignitions through education and enforcement,
    and skilful management of natural and anthropogenic fires to create a landscape
    mosaic of burned and recovering areas
  13: Calls for increased investment in training, institutional capacity building,
    and fostering diversity among researchers and practitioners in fire management.
Quantitative material:

    Land estimated to have reduced accountable non-CO2 emissions by 37.7% relative
    to emissions in the decade prior to the intervention; Boreal forests contain somewhere
    between 367.3 Pg and 1,715.8 Pg of carbon; Around 0.2 Pg of carbon is emitted
    from the boreal zone annually.
