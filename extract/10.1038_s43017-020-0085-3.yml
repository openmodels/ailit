Drivers of Risk:
  2: Modification of landscapes during the Anthropocene contributes to fire disasters.
  3: Reduced solar radiation; Air pollution/increased aerosols; Black carbon deposition;
    Localized rainfall; Post-fire debris flow; Permafrost thaw/loss; Pyric herbivory;
    Indigenous burning; Nitrogen deposition; Phosphorus deposition; Sediment deposition;
    Topography controls severity; Erosion changes topography; Altered soil colour/albedo;
    Heat fracture; Evolutionary adaptation/epicormic resprouts; Evolutionary adaptation/basal
    resprouts; Post-fire flooding; Algal blooms; Drought; Fuel dryness; Climate change;
    Anthropogenic drivers; Land-cover conversion; Interannual drought cycles.
  5: Increased vegetation-fire activity as a result of increased Fire Weather Index
    (FWI), and fire emissions.
  6: "Anthropogenic climate change, vegetation changes related to agriculture or invasive\
    \ species, drought cycles such as El Ni\xF1o\u2013Southern Oscillation."

    anthropogenic change (Land-use change, Land-cover change, Invasive species, Removal
    of grazers, Indigenous/cultural fire removal), Increased Fire-disaster ignitions,
    Fire suppression, WUI expansion, Fuel alteration.

    urban interfaces due to ineffective fire management."

    Post-fire geophysical disasters.
Highlights:
  3: Emerging picture of changes in global fire activity emphasizes the importance
    of regional-scale variation, climate change and anthropogenic drivers.
  5: The page presents trends in vegetation-fire activity across various regions,
    including Africa, Western USA, Canada, Australia, Chile, Portugal, Indonesia,
    and the Brazilian Amazonia, providing data on fire emissions, burned areas, and
    fire weather indices over different time periods.
  6: Fire seasons are lengthening and becoming more extreme, and lightning ignitions
    are increasing, contributing to economically destructive fire events.
  9: Ecosystems on the fringe of a bioclimatic niche or in climate/fire refugia are
    particularly vulnerable to transformative fire regimes.
  10: "The need for sustainable fire management through careful fuel management in\
    \ flammable landscapes and wildland\u2013urban interfaces."
  13: A global database (similar in form to the Global Fire Atlas) on the economic
    costs of wildfire management and economics losses from fire disasters is required.
Methodology:
  3: Analysis of fire activity amongst biomes demands regional rather than global
    analyses. Metrics other than burned area are needed, including fire intensity
    and fire severity.
  5: The analysis uses historical reconstructions, Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity
    (MTBS) data, and MODIS data, bias corrected using periods of overlap to the reference
    MTBS record.
  6: "Uses process-based coupled Earth System Models with integrated fire\u2013vegetation\
    \ dynamics and statistical approaches to model future changes in global fire activity."
  8: Process-based mechanistic modelling incorporates the complex interplay of climate,
    CO2, vegetation and fire, and, sometimes, impacts of land-use change and change
    in ignitions.
  9: The analysis appears to be based on modeling future fire regimes and observing
    patterns in area burned.
  10: Discussion of adaptation and management strategies for wildfires based on environmental
    and socio-ecological contexts.
  13: Economic models are essential to informing investment in sustainable fire management
    and understanding the full costs of fire disasters, including human health impacts.
More Notes:
  3: Extreme fire events are characterized by anomalous fire behaviour, involving
    extremely high energy releases, very rapid rate of spread, very large flame heights;
    massive emission of smoke and greenhouse gas pollution; prolonged duration of
    fires, enormous geographical scale of burned areas, or both; fires causing unusually
    adverse biological, atmospheric or geomorphological effects.
  5: The page primarily focuses on presenting data and trends related to fire activity,
    rather than explicitly analyzing macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes. The inclusion
    of US federal fire-suppression costs in the Western USA chart provides some indication
    of fiscal impact, but this is not a central focus of the page.
  6: The paper discusses the complexity of attributing increased fire activity solely
    to climate change due to various influencing factors.
  8: The page primarily discusses the relationship between climate change, fire, and
    vegetation, focusing on factors driving altered fire regimes. The consequences
    of these effects on the global climate, vegetation and wildfire are shown on the
    black lines, and the effects of post-colonial anthropogenic changes to global
    climate, vegetation and wildfire are shown on the red lines.
  9: The feedback process of forest conversion to grassland is likely self-correcting,
    shifting from flammability-limited to fuel-limited with reduced productivity.
  10: Adaptation strategies must be tailored to specific environmental conditions,
    and broad-scale prescribed burning is suggested as a cost-effective risk reduction
    method.
  13: Wildfire management and adaptation cannot be evidence-based or cost-effective
    without strategic investment in training, research and development, and evaluation
    of mitigation strategies.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Major fire disasters have major economic impacts, affecting life, property and
    human health.

  5: No relevant information
  6: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes or economic costs and benefits of
    adaptation are directly discussed on this page.
  9: Conversion of infrequently burned forest to frequently burned, treeless state
    is associated with declines in carbon storage and increased annual global fire-induced
    emissions.

    are detailed on this page.

Quantitative material:
  2: "California in the USA saw an estimated USD $40 billion in structure losses alone\
    \ in a dozen major wildfires in 2017\u20132018."
  3: From 1979 to 2013, an average increase of 18.7% in fire-weather-season length
    has been documented across global burnable lands. Extreme fire-weather conditions,
    alongside drought and fuel dryness, are associated with extreme fire events. Between
    1998 and 2015, the area burned by vegetation fires globally declined by around
    25%, from over 500 Mha to less than 400 Mha annually.
  6: "Projected increase in the number of days exceeding the 95th percentile of the\
    \ Fire Weather Index by 130% in the Mediterranean and nearly 40% for Alaska at\
    \ 2\xB0C above pre-industrial levels."
  9: The figure depicts the declines in sequestered carbon and the increase in emission
    rate associated with the conversion of forest to treeless state.
  10: There is no quantitative information presented about the outcomes of interest
    on this page.
  13: Data on the economic costs of wildfire management and economics losses from
    fire disasters are only available for a few regions (such as the USA and Canada).
