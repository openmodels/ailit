Drivers of Risk:
  1: Future climate change projections including strong future warming and general
    annual-mean rainfall increases.
  5: No relevant information
  21: Increasing temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns are key drivers impacting
    agricultural yields, with temperature stress affecting maize and bean production
    in medium-to-high altitude areas and climate-induced water stress affecting maize
    in lower elevation areas. Decreases in grass cover may have potentially serious
    implications for pastoralism.
Highlights:
  1: East Africa is likely to experience some ecosystem service benefits through increased
    precipitation, river runoff and fresh water availability.
  5: The paper categorizes GCMs based on simulated climate changes and trends in temperature
    and precipitation using historical data.
  21: The study suggests potential increases for tropical maize production where water
    is not limiting, but declines for highland maize and bean production. Runoff is
    projected to increase.
Methodology:
  1: The LPJ dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) was used with input from eighteen
    future climate projections from nine GCMs participating in the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment.
  5: The study analyzes climate change impacts using multiple global climate models
    (GCMs) and observations in East Africa, examining data from 1850-2100.
  21: The study uses the LPJ model to simulate the impacts of climate change on ecosystem
    goods and services, focusing on water and food security in East Africa, applicable
    to the 2080-2100 period.
More Notes:
  1: Simulations showed future increases in tropical woody vegetation over the region
    at the expense of grasslands.
  5: Focuses on ecosystem functioning and climate projections in East Africa, comparing
    GCM simulations with observed data for validation.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Possible improved crop yields in some areas due to enhancements in NPP (Net Primary
    Productivity).

  21: "Potential increases for tropical maize food production where water availability\
    \ is not limiting; tropical highland maize and bean production is likely to decline\
    \ in a warmer future climate, which may have important impacts on householders\u2019\
    \ incomes and food security."
Quantitative material:
  1: "Regional increases in net primary productivity (NPP) (18\u201336%) and total\
    \ carbon storage (3\u201313%) by 2080\u20132099 compared with the present-day\
    \ were common to all simulations."

  21: "The mean change in runoff across the simulations is 94 mm yr/C or a 19% increase\
    \ in 2080\u20132100 compared with 1981\u20132000. Projected increases in carbon\
    \ storage in the region (3\u201313%)."
