Drivers of Risk:
  2: Severe drought coupled with anthropogenic land-use change increasing fire activities
    in forests and peatlands.
  6: "Anthropogenic climate change, specifically changes in precipitation (\u25B3\
    P) leading to increased drought risk, El Ni\xF1o events, different warming scenarios\
    \ (1.5\xB0C, 2.0\xB0C, 3.0\xB0C)."
  7: Climate change increases the chances of severe drought and fire events, which
    in turn lead to increased CO2 and PM2.5 emissions.
  18: CO2 emissions, Land-use CO2 emissions (including fire emissions), SSP baseline
    scenarios
Highlights:
  2: Examines whether historical climate changes increased the probabilities of drought,
    fire and fire emissions of CO2 and PM2.5 during the June-November dry season of
    2015.
  6: Anthropogenic climate change significantly increases the probability of droughts
    and, consequently, burned area, CO2 emissions, and PM2.5 emissions. Even achieving
    the Paris Agreement goals, the risks remain high. Current warming trajectory leads
    to very high probabilities of exceeding observed values for these outcomes. Fire
    CO2 emissions can have substantial implications for mitigation policies, potentially
    exceeding emission targets of several SSP scenarios.
  7: "Increased fire and emission risks under warming scenarios show the importance\
    \ of achieving the 2.0\xB0C goal and the benefits of adaptation investments."
  18: "The graph shows the cumulative probability of exceeding a 2.0\xB0C global temperature\
    \ rise as a function of CO2 emissions, with projections to 2100 under different\
    \ SSP baseline scenarios."
Methodology:
  2: "Probabilistic event attribution (PEA) using large ensemble simulations (100\
    \ members) of the MIROC5 atmospheric global climate model (AGCM). Examines probabilities\
    \ of drought, fire, and fire emissions of CO2 and PM2.5 during the June-November\
    \ dry season of 2015. Also analyzes changes in extreme events at 1.5\xBAC and\
    \ 2.0\xBAC warming levels using the MIROC5 AGCM under the HAPPI project."
  6: "Large ensemble simulations are used to estimate the probabilities of drought\
    \ exceeding observed values. Cumulative histograms of \u25B3P are used to estimate\
    \ probabilities. Uncertainty is assessed through resampling techniques. Empirical\
    \ relationships between \u25B3P and burned area/fire emissions are used. Comparison\
    \ of estimated fire CO2 emissions with land-use CO2 emission scenarios from integrated\
    \ assessment models (AIM/CGE) under different SSPs."
  7: Analysis is based on the MIROC5 AGCM ensembles and probabilistic event attribution,
    with historical and HAPPI experiments performed for different warming scenarios.
  18: "AIM/CGE model is used to project land-use CO2 emissions under different SSP\
    \ baseline scenarios; The analysis is based on simulations from 2006-2016 for\
    \ 2.0\xBAC warming scenarios, and projects to the year 2100."
More Notes:
  2: "The study aims to investigate changes in extreme events at 1.5\xBAC and 2.0\xBA\
    C warming levels to inform stakeholders after the Paris Agreement."
  6: "The analysis focuses on the East Asia (EA) area, considering the impact of El\
    \ Ni\xF1o events on fire emissions. The paper acknowledges that using long-term\
    \ mean precipitation anomalies instead of single-year data results in lower fire\
    \ CO2 emissions.  The comparison with SSP scenarios is conservative because the\
    \ SSP simulations do not fully account for the effects of climate change on fires,\
    \ and the SSP emissions cover a larger area and additional sources."
  7: The study stresses the need for effective land management policies to address
    fire risks and mentions incorporating SST anomalies for future work.
  18: The analysis focuses on East and South East Asia regions, except China and Japan,
    for the SSP baseline scenarios.

  6: "Historical anthropogenic climate change increased the chance of \u25B3P being\
    \ more negative than observed from 2% (1-4%) to 9% (6-14%).  At 1.5\xB0C, 2.0\xB0\
    C, and 3.0\xB0C warming, the chance of exceeding observed \u25B3P increases to\
    \ 82% (76-87%), 67% (60-74%), and 93% (89-96%), respectively.  Historical anthropogenic\
    \ drying increased the probability of exceeding the observed values of burned\
    \ area from 5% (0-18%) to 23% (3-52%), CO2 emissions from 5% (0-15%) to 23% (3-47%),\
    \ and PM2.5 emissions from 2% (0-5%) to 24% (3-49%). At 1.5\xB0C, 2.0\xB0C and\
    \ 3.0\xB0C, chances of exceeding observed values significantly increase for burned\
    \ area (93% (66-99%), 81% (50-95%) and 98% (84-100%)), CO2 emissions (92% (72-98%),\
    \ 81% (55-93%) and 98% (86-100%)), and PM2.5 emissions (93% (70-98%), 81% (54-94%)\
    \ and 98% (85-100%))."
  7: "Probabilities for exceeding 2015 drought observations increase considerably\
    \ under different warming scenarios: 82% for 1.5\xB0C, 67% for 2.0\xB0C, and 93%\
    \ for 3.0\xB0C."
