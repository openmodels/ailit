Drivers of Risk:
  3: Global warming, historical land-use changes, changes in socio-economic conditions
    (SSP2), differential bioenergy requirements associated with the transformation
    of the energy system.
  7: Climate change (from RCP2.6 and RCP6.0), population projections, socio-economic
    conditions, land use changes, irrigation patterns, fertilizer input, nitrogen
    deposition, changing diets under economic development, climate-change effects
    on crop yields, and bioenergy demand.
  8: "Global-mean-temperature projections from IPSL-CM5A-LR and HadGEM2-ES under RCP2.6\
    \ exceed 1.5\u25E6C relative to pre-industrial levels in the second half of the\
    \ 21st century; GFDL-ESM2M stays below 1.5\u25E6C until 2100; MIROC5 stabilizes\
    \ at about 1.5\u25E6C during the second half of the 21st century."
  10: The dataset includes variables such as precipitation (total precipitation including
    rainfall and snowfall), temperature (near-surface air temperature, daily maximum
    and minimum), surface radiation (downwelling longwave and shortwave), and wind
    speed, all of which are drivers of climate change impacts.
  13: Sea-level rise is identified as an important factor for climate-related impacts
    on coastal infrastructure and ecosystems.
  15: Population changes and changes in national GDP are considered as drivers, in
    addition to climate change and land use patterns.
  16: Changes in reservoir management, water withdrawal and consumption for domestic,
    industrial, and irrigation purposes, and fertilizer application rates.
  19: The paper focuses on anthropogenic climate change and greenhouse gas emissions,
    and resulting climate-sensitive impacts.
  20: Changes in climate (temperature, precipitation), CO2 concentration, land use,
    nitrogen deposition, fertilizer input, irrigation, water abstraction, dams and
    reservoirs, forest management, population, GDP, coastal protection, and fishing
    catch data.
  21: Climate change (RCP2.6 and RCP6.0), CO2 concentrations, and land use/human influences.
Evaluation overview:

    \ or \u201Cnumber of people affected by long-term changes going beyond a certain\
    \ range of the reference distribution\u201D are evaluated."

  19: "The impacts of 1.5\xB0C and 2\xB0C warming, and the 1\xB0C of global warming\
    \ that has occurred between pre-industrial times and the present day, are being\
    \ evaluated across various sectors."
  20: Impacts of climate change on various sectors, including biomes, forestry, permafrost,
    energy, health, and fisheries.
Highlights:
  3: Provides the scientific basis for an aggregation of impacts across sectors and
    analysis of cross-sectoral interactions.
  7: "The study aims to assess the impacts of 1.5\xB0C global warming, including the\
    \ effects of reaching 1.5\xB0C, returning to 1.5\xB0C, and stabilizing at that\
    \ level, considering both climate and socioeconomic changes. It also aims to provide\
    \ a basis for developing simplified models for scaling impacts to other global-mean-temperature\
    \ and CO2 pathways."
  8: Four GCMs provide a fractional range coverage close to the mean fractional range
    coverage across randomly chosen four-member sets of CMIP5 GCMs.
  13: The paper presents a strategy for disaggregation of land use types, separating
    crops used for food, feed, and bioenergy to preserve cropland area calculations.
  15: Uses SSP2 storyline to create population and GDP projections for use in ISIMIP2b.
  16: Reservoir management is assumed to be fixed at 2005 levels in future projections.
  17: No relevant information
  18: ISIMIP2b aims for multi-model integration between sectors to better represent
    the links and feedbacks that occur in the observed Earth system, a significant
    change from previous assessments where sectors were assessed in isolation.
  19: "The ISIMIP2b scenario design enables an assessment of the impacts of 1.5 and\
    \ 2\xB0C warming, as well as the impacts of the 1\xB0C of global warming that\
    \ has already occurred."
Methodology:
  1: "The paper describes the simulation protocol for the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model\
    \ Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2b) to assess impacts of 1.5\xB0C global warming."
  3: "The Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) provides tailored,\
    \ cross-sectorally consistent impact projections. It involves simulation protocols\
    \ designed to separate impacts of historical warming, quantify impacts of additional\
    \ warming up to 1.5\u25E6C, and assess climate effects based on climate scenarios\
    \ while accounting for simultaneous changes in socio-economic conditions."
  7: "Simulations are run under different scenarios: pre-industrial climate with future\
    \ human influences, future climate and human influences under RCP2.6 and RCP6.0,\
    \ and an extension of RCP2.6 simulations to 2299 with human influences fixed at\
    \ 2100 levels. Bias-adjusted climate input data at daily temporal and 0.5\u25E6\
    \ horizontal resolution is used, based on CMIP5 output of GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES,\
    \ IPSL-CM5A-LR, and MIROC5."
  8: "Uses four GCMs (GFDL-ESM2M, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC5, and HadGEM2-ES) under RCP2.6\
    \ and RCP6.0 from 2006 to 2099, with some models extending to 2299; Analysis includes\
    \ recycling pre-industrial control climate data for HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR,\
    \ and MIROC5 to fill the entire 1661\u20132299 period."
  9: "The reference dataset for bias adjustment is EWEMBI, covering the globe at 0.5\u25E6\
    \ horizontal and daily temporal resolution from 1979 to 2013."
  10: The paper describes the data sources and bias adjustment methods used to create
    the EWEMBI dataset, which includes various climate variables like temperature,
    precipitation, radiation, and wind speed. Bias adjustment methods include quantile
    mapping and rescaling climatologies. The study also mentions using adjusted humidity
    calculations and providing unadjusted sea-level pressure and wind data.
  11: Future LU projections are based on the MAgPIE model, considering bioenergy demand,
    greenhouse gas prices, and SSP2 storyline.
  13: Sea-level rise patterns are constructed from individual components, using GCM
    data and incorporating glacier, ice sheet, and land water storage contributions.
  15: Historical GDP data is extrapolated from national income and GDP time series
    using data from Penn World Tables and the Maddison project. Missing data is filled
    using data from Penn World Tables and World Development Indicators. Future projections
    of national GDP are taken from the SSP database and linearly interpolated. Gridded
    GDP data is downscaled using population data from HYDE3.2 for the historical period
    and SSP2 gridded population projections for the future period.
  16: The paper describes the representation of socio-economic drivers in historical
    simulations and future projections, specifically related to water resources and
    fertilizer use. Future projections for water are based on SSP2 with RCP6.0, with
    identical data used for RCP2.6, acknowledging that the difference between the
    RCPs is expected to be small. Water data is generated by individual modeling groups
    using land use and irrigation patterns. Future projections for fertilizer is provided
    by the LUH2-ISIMIP2b dataset, which differs for SSP2+RCP2.6 and SSP2+RCP6.0.
  18: The ISIMIP2b protocol provides a consistent and documented framework for assessing
    impacts at the global scale using multiple GCMs, impact models, and sectors. It
    includes a pre-industrial reference and full coverage of the historical period.
    The time line of ISIMIP2b was chosen to meet the critical deadlines of the IPCC
    Special Report.
  19: The paper discusses the ISIMIP2b protocol and the simulations that arise from
    it. The study looks at pre-industrial times to the present day.
  20: Compares simulations with pre-industrial climate and stable greenhouse gas concentrations
    to simulations with climate change and direct human influences on climate-sensitive
    indicators. Uses various climate and CO2 concentration scenarios (picontrol, historical,
    rcp26, rcp60, 2005co2, 2299rcp26) and socio-economic scenarios (1860soc, histsoc,
    2005soc, 2015soc, rcp26soc, rcp60soc, 2100rcp26soc, 2100ssp2soc, ssp2soc_adapt,
    nosoc). Applicable for assessing climate-sensitive impacts and potential trade-offs
    of mitigation measures.
  21: The table describes the experimental setup for global and regional water model
    simulations within the ISIMIP2b framework. It outlines seven different experiments
    with varying climate and land use scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP6.0), covering historical
    (1861-2005) and future (2006-2299) time periods. The experiments differ in whether
    climate change and land-use/human influences are held constant or allowed to vary
    according to the RCP scenarios. Land use is typically held constant after 2005
    or 2100.
More Notes:
  8: Selection of GCMs heavily constrained by CMIP5 data availability, requiring daily
    output for atmospheric variables covering pre-industrial control, historical,
    and RCP scenarios; IPSL-CM5A-LR and GFDL-ESM2M are given priority for impact modeling.
  10: The paper acknowledges an inconsistency in wind data adjustment and advises
    caution when comparing models using adjusted total wind velocity to those using
    non-adjusted wind components.
  15: Mentions other external drivers such as dams/reservoirs, irrigation, fertilizer
    application, nitrogen deposition, fishing intensities, and forest management,
    and provides information on how these drivers are represented in models.
  16: "The ISIMIP2a varsoc scenario is mentioned. The combination SSP2\u2013RCP2.6\
    \ was not considered in the Water Futures and Solutions project. Some datasets\
    \ are mandatory for harmonization across models, while others are provided for\
    \ support."
  18: The simulations include 'nosoc' runs for exploration of the effects of climate
    change compared to pre-industrial climate, allowing for a better assessment of
    the relative importance of human impacts versus climate impacts.
  19: The table provides a list of ISIMIP focus regions with their corresponding coordinates,
    river basins, or region names for regional water simulations; coordinates for
    regional lake simulations; coordinates for regional forestry simulations; and
    coordinates for ocean regions.
  20: Acknowledges the difficulty in completely disentangling the effects of human
    activity on climate and climate-sensitive impacts, but aims to represent socio-economic
    drivers on impact indicators.
