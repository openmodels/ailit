Drivers of Risk:
  3: "Projected changes in weather and climate are considered drivers of risk, impacting\
    \ individual systems or processes, including vegetation cover, crop yields, marine\
    \ ecosystems and \uFB01shing potentials, frequency and intensity of river \uFB02\
    oods, coastal \uFB02ooding due to sea-levelrise, waterscarcity, distributionofvector-bornediseases,\
    \ changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services, heat and cold-related mortality,\
    \ labour productivity, and energy supply (e.g. hydropower potentials) or demand."
  8: Annual global mean near-surface temperature change relative to pre-industrial
    levels
  23: Climate change causing loss in the economic value of European forest land.
Highlights:
  3: The study aims to provide a scientific basis for an aggregation of impacts across
    sectors and analysis of cross-sectoral interactions. It uses a range of impact
    models across different sectors to facilitate consistent impact projections.
  8: Global-mean-temperature projections exceed 1.5C in some models and scenarios,
    and remain below 1.5C in others by 2100.
  23: Climate change may cause severe loss in the economic value of European forest
    land.
Methodology:
  3: "The paper describes the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project\
    \ (ISIMIP) which aims to provide tailored, cross-sectorally consistent impact\
    \ projections. The simulation protocol allows for separation of impacts of historical\
    \ warming, quantification of impacts of additional warming up to 1.5\xB0C, and\
    \ assessment of climate effects based on climate scenarios and socio-economic\
    \ changes. The simulations consider different Representative Concentration Pathways\
    \ (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)."
  8: Simulations with IPSL-CM5A-LR, GFDL-ESM2M, MIROC5 and HadGEM2-ES under different
    CMIP5 experiments (pre-industrial control, historical, RCP2.6, RCP6.0) from 2006
    to 2099

More Notes:
  8: Focuses on climate model data used as input for impact assessments (ISIMIP2b).
    The choice of GCMs (IPSL-CM5A-LR and GFDL-ESM2M as first and second priority)
    was driven by data availability for marine ecosystem and fisheries modelling (FISH-MIP)

    focusing on economic losses in European forest land due to climate change.

    modeling framework. It doesn't directly present macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes, costs, or benefits of adaptation at a national level. It focuses on
    the setup of simulations, not the results themselves.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: National gross domestic product (GDP) is mentioned as a highly aggregated socio-economic
    indicator that has been linked to climate indicators.

Quantitative material:
  8: "Global-mean-temperature projections from IPSL-CM5A-LR and HadGEM2-ES under RCP2.6\
    \ exceed 1.5\u25E6C relative to pre-industrial levels in the second half of the\
    \ 21st century; temperature change returns to 1.5\u25E6C or even slightly lower\
    \ by 2299 in HadGEM2-ES, it only reaches about 2\u25E6C in IPSL-CM5A-LR by 2299;\
    \ For GFDL-ESM2M, global-mean-temperature change stays below 1.5\u25E6C until\
    \ 2100; For MIROC5, it stabilizes at about 1.5\u25E6C during the second half of\
    \ the 21st century"
