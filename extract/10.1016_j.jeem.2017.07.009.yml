Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature changes (seasonal averages and temperature bins); Global climate
    models (UKMO-HadCM3 and PCM) under different warming scenarios (B1 and A2)
  2: Temperature changes and high temperatures affecting industrial output and investment;
    inventory levels increase in response to high temperatures.
  3: Temperature increase impacting industrial firms' economic performance, including
    profit and industrial output.
  4: Temperature changes impacting input productivities, market prices of inputs and
    output, and the adaptation effort undertaken by the firm.
  5: Daily average temperature, rainfall, sunshine duration, air pressure, relative
    humidity, and average wind speed.
  6: The study merges firm-level output data with county-level weather data by county
    and year, suggesting weather as a driver of risk.
  8: Seasonal temperature (spring, summer, fall, winter)
  9: Temperature changes, particularly summer temperatures, and their correlation
    with sunshine hours.
  10: Daily average temperature; Rainfall; Sunshine duration; Air pressure; Relative
    humidity; Average wind speed.
  11: Temperature changes
  12: Temperature variations and shocks (seasonal average temperatures, temperature
    bins)
  13: Daily average temperature, seasonal average temperatures.
  14: Summer and winter temperature changes.
  15: Changes in summer temperature (Tempsummer).
  16: Projected changes in seasonal average temperatures under different warming scenarios
    (B1, A1B, and A2) based on climate models UKMO-HadCM3 and PCM.
  17: Temperature changes, specifically increased summer temperatures and changes
    in spring, fall and winter temperature
Highlights:
  1: "Industrial output is nonlinear in temperature changes; Lagged temperature changes\
    \ exert large and significant impacts on current year\u2019s output; Higher summer\
    \ temperatures have larger detrimental effects on output in low-temperature regions."
  2: Findings show nonlinear temperature effects on industrial output with a critical
    temperature threshold; adaptation to high temperatures observed in certain regions.
  3: New evidence suggesting adaptation to global warming may have been undertaken
    in high-temperature regions in China.
  4: The study aims to obtain the total marginal effect of temperature on output,
    including direct and indirect effects through input productivities, prices, and
    adaptation. It also examines the remaining effects of temperature on industrial
    output after firms' adjustments in input use and potential climate adaptations.
  5: Temperature variations have a statistically significant impact on firm-level
    industrial output.
  8: "Summer temperature has the largest positive impact on output. A 1\xB0C increase\
    \ in summer temperature leads to a statistically significant increase in log value\
    \ added per worker."
  9: Differential seasonal effects on output are identified, with significant negative
    impacts from summer and winter temperatures and positive effects from spring and
    fall temperatures.
  10: "The relationship between temperature and output is nonlinear and exhibits an\
    \ inverted-U shape when temperature is above 15\xB0C. Output responds negatively\
    \ to low temperatures (< 12\xB0C). [21\xB0C, 24\xB0C) is identified as a critical\
    \ temperature threshold."
  11: Negative effects on output of elevated temperatures in the prior two years can
    be carried over into the following years.
  12: "Rising summer temperatures have statistically significant negative impacts\
    \ on output. There is a critical temperature threshold between 21\xB0C and 24\xB0\
    C. Future global warming is expected to lead to a reduction in output because\
    \ the negative effects of summer and winter temperatures outweigh the positive\
    \ effects of spring and fall."
  13: Low and high temperatures negatively influence firms' investment. Inventory
    is positively correlated with extreme temperatures. Temperature changes in prior
    years can affect industrial firms' production in the following years. Output is
    nonlinear in temperature changes and exhibits negative responses to low and high
    temperatures. There is substantial heterogeneity in the effects of temperature
    on output across industries.
  14: Higher summer temperatures have large and negative impacts on output. Higher
    winter temperatures negatively impact several industries, including stationary,
    office machinery, food processing, leather, rubber, and non-ferrous metal smelting.
    The effects of temperature vary across industries.
  15: High-temperature regions are better at adapting to elevated summer temperatures
    compared to low-temperature regions. The coefficient estimate of the interaction
    term between the 'high-temperature' dummy and Tempsummer is positive and statistically
    significant (at the 5% level).
  16: Future warming is projected to cause significant reductions in China's industrial
    output, with the magnitude of the impact depending on the climate model and warming
    scenario. The UKMO-HadCM3 model generally projects larger output reductions than
    the PCM model. The reduction in output is expected to be considerably larger in
    the long term compared to the medium term.
  17: "Industrial output exhibits nonlinear responses to temperature changes; Estimated\
    \ negative effects on industrial output due to higher summer temperatures are\
    \ larger than previous estimates for other countries; Lagged temperature changes\
    \ in prior years exert large and significant impacts on current year\u2019s output."
Methodology:
  1: Firm-level panel data of annual industrial output paired with fine-scale daily
    weather data to estimate the responses of industrial output to temperature changes
    in China.
  2: Analysis uses firm-level panel data from 1998-2007 combined with fine-scale daily
    weather data; employs temperature bins and seasonal averages as temperature variables.
  3: Empirical analysis using a comprehensive firm-level data set for China, including
    sunshine duration as an explanatory variable.
  4: 'Regression analysis using seasonal average temperatures and temperature bins
    as explanatory variables for industrial output, controlling for weather variables,
    industry-year fixed effects, and firm fixed effects. Two approaches are used:
    seasonal average temperatures and temperature bins.'
  5: The temperature effects on output are identified from the random variations in
    temperature over time, using a fixed effects model with two-way clustering (firms
    and prefecture-level city-years) to account for spatial and serial correlation
    of error terms. The analysis covers the period 1998-2007 in China.
  6: The study uses firm-level data from 1998-2007, merging it with county-level weather
    data. They use an unbalanced panel with 1,803,482 observations.
  8: Regression analysis with firm fixed effects and two-digit industry/year fixed
    effects; standard errors clustered within firms and within prefecture-level city-years.
    Models include contemporaneous temperature effects, and a model with one-year
    lagged temperature effects. Weather variables include temperature, rainfall, air
    pressure, relative humidity, average wind speed, and sunshine hours.
  9: The analysis uses seasonal average temperatures instead of annual averages and
    considers lagged effects of temperature changes.
  10: Regression analysis using temperature bins as temperature variables, including
    linear and quadratic forms of rainfall and sunshine duration, and means of air
    pressure, relative humidity and average wind speed. Includes firm fixed effects
    and two-digit industry/year fixed effects. Standard errors clustered within firms
    and within prefecture-level city-years. Considers models with no lags and two-year
    lags of weather variables.
  11: Regression analysis using temperature bins as temperature variables, including
    controls for rainfall, sunshine duration, air pressure, relative humidity, and
    wind speed. Firm fixed effects and two-digit industry/year fixed effects are included.
    Two lags of weather variables are incorporated. Standard errors are clustered
    within firms and within prefecture-level city-years.
  12: Regression analyses using firm-level data from China. Robustness checks involve
    variations in econometric estimation strategies, data samples, and model specifications
    including fixed effects and dynamic panel data approaches (GMM).
  13: Panel data analysis incorporating firm fixed effects and industry/year fixed
    effects. Regressions use temperature bins as temperature variables and incorporate
    linear and quadratic forms of sums of rainfall and sunshine duration and means
    of air pressure, relative humidity and average wind speed as additional weather
    variables. Standard errors are clustered within firms and within prefecture-level
    city-years. Effects are estimated with four lags of weather variables for each
    two-digit industry. Cumulative effects of summer and winter temperatures are measured.
  14: Estimation of a regression equation (Eq. (2)) including temperature, sunshine
    hours, rainfall, air pressure, relative humidity, and average wind speed as weather
    variables. Four lags of the weather variables are included. Firm and year fixed
    effects are incorporated. Standard errors are clustered within firms and within
    prefecture-level city-years.
  15: Regression analysis using firm fixed effects and two-digit industry/year fixed
    effects, including temperature, sunshine hours, rainfall, air pressure, relative
    humidity, and average wind speed as weather variables.
  16: The study calculates projected changes in seasonal average temperatures using
    the ClimateWizard database. These temperature changes are then used, along with
    coefficient estimates of the cumulative temperature effects on output, to compute
    firm-specific predicted changes in output, weighted by each firm's share in total
    output. The results are applicable to China's industrial output in the medium
    term (2050s) and long term (2080s).
  17: Firm-level panel data of annual industrial output combined with fine-scale daily
    weather data; Temperature bins are used to identify critical temperature thresholds;
    Coefficient estimates of contemporaneous and lagged temperature variables are
    used to predict the impacts of future global warming on industrial output.
More Notes:
  1: The study uses firm-level data from China.
  2: Heterogeneity in temperature effects observed across industries, with differences
    in effect based on regional temperature profiles; results consistent across various
    model specifications.
  4: The study uses data from firms in China and accounts for simultaneous variations
    in temperature and other weather variables. Lagged values of weather variables
    are also included.
  6: The study identifies general equipment manufacturing, non-metallic minerals,
    chemicals, textiles, and agro-food processing as the five largest industrial sectors
    in the sample.
  8: The bar chart visually represents the estimated temperature effects on output,
    including lagged effects. The study uses data from firms in a specific country
    (likely China, given the authors' names), and results may not be generalizable
    to other countries.
  10: Higher winter temperatures increase the share of female workers and reduce the
    share of male workers, with an insignificant impact on the total number of workers
    employed.
  12: Analysis uses data from 1998-2007 for robustness. Weather data is obtained from
    820 weather stations. The study considers autocorrelation and spatial correlation
    of error terms. Study uses both seasonal average temperatures and temperature
    bins as temperature variables.
  14: The study explores adaptation actions by examining temperature effects in regions
    with different temperature levels (above/below Huai River-Qin Mountains line).
  15: "The definition of 'high-temperature' regions varies across columns: (1) based\
    \ on the Huai River-Qin Mountains line, (2) hot and humid, (3) hot and above-median\
    \ rainfall. The temperature effects are interpreted as the percentage changes\
    \ in output with a 1\xB0C increase in temperature. The analysis accounts for weather\
    \ variable lags."
  16: The main driver of future output reductions is the projected increase in summer
    temperature.
  17: The study acknowledges a caveat that the data set covers observations for only
    a short period of time, which might overestimate future damages due to the lack
    of capturing long-term adaptation by firms.

  17: Industrial output
Quantitative material:
  1: "Industrial output increases linearly with temperature up to 21-24\xB0C and then\
    \ declines sharply. Industrial output is projected to decrease by 3-36% by 2080\
    \ under the slowest warming scenario (B1) and by 12-46% under the most rapid warming\
    \ scenario (A2)."
  2: "Output declines sharply at temperatures above 21-24\xB0C, with a negative effect\
    \ stemming from increased summer temperatures leading to a reduction in output\
    \ of 3.5-5.6% per 1\xB0C increase."
  4: Regression models are used to estimate the percentage changes in output with
    a 1 degree Celsius increase in seasonal average temperatures.
  5: "The study uses temperature bins to categorize temperature effects, with Tbin1r;t\
    \ representing the number of days when the daily average temperature is below\
    \ 0\xB0C, Tbin2r;t representing the number of days when the temperature falls\
    \ into the range of [0\xB0C, 3\xB0C), and so on, up to Tbin16r;t representing\
    \ the number of days when the temperature is above 30\xB0C."
  6: "The data set includes 530,370 firms located in 31 provinces and province-equivalent\
    \ municipal cities, with the total output accounting for more than 85% of China\u2019\
    s total industrial output."
  8: "Table 1 shows coefficient estimates of seasonal temperature variables on log\
    \ value added per worker; these coefficients represent the percentage change in\
    \ output with a 1\xB0C increase in temperature."
  9: "Quantitative estimates include a reduction in output by 3.5-5.6% for each 1\xB0\
    C increase in average summer temperature."
  10: "Nonlinear relationship between temperature and output, exhibiting an inverted-U\
    \ shape when temperature is above 15\xB0C. Output responds negatively to low temperatures\
    \ (< 12\xB0C).  Critical temperature threshold is [21\xB0C, 24\xB0C), relative\
    \ to which other temperature bins have non-positive marginal effects on industrial\
    \ output."
  11: "Replacing days at [21-24\xB0C) temperatures with full days at 30\xB0C will\
    \ decrease output by 7.7%. Replacing days at [21-24\xB0C) temperatures with full\
    \ days at 0-12\xB0C will decrease output by 9.5%."
  12: "Negative contemporaneous temperature effects on output from rising summer temperatures\
    \ are statistically significant at the 1% level, ranging between 2.7% and 5.6%.\
    \ Negative effects of each 1\xB0C increase in winter temperature lie between 1.2%\
    \ and 3.4%. Cumulative effects of summer and winter temperatures on output are\
    \ negative and statistically significant, at (-)8.9 to (-)26.5% and (-)6.2 to\
    \ (-)14.2%, respectively. Cumulative effect of spring temperature on output is\
    \ also statistically significant and ranges between 5.9% and 14.6% (with one exception)."
  13: "An additional day at 30\xB0C or 12\xB0C can lead to reductions in firms' investment\
    \ by about 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively. An additional day with average temperatures\
    \ below 3\xB0C or above 30\xB0C can cause a significant increase in firms' inventory\
    \ levels. Cumulative effects of a 1\xB0C increase in summer temperature are output\
    \ reductions of 48.7%, 41.2% and 34.7%, respectively, in the ferrous metal mining,\
    \ timber, and rubber industries."
  14: "A 1\xB0C increase in winter temperature leads to a 42.9% reduction in stationary\
    \ output and a 33% reduction in office machinery output. Higher winter temperatures\
    \ lead to substantial output losses in food processing, leather, rubber, and non-ferrous\
    \ metal smelting."

    value added per worker in different 'high-temperature' regions under different
    definitions of 'high-temperature'.
  16: Output in China in the medium term is projected to decrease by 10.6-27.2% under
    the A2 scenario, 12.9-35.9% under the A1B scenario, and 5.2-19.6% under the B1
    scenario, based on the UKMO-HadCM3 model. The corresponding output reductions
    in the medium term are projected to be 5.2-10.3% under the A2 scenario, 7.4-17.0%
    under the A1B scenario, and 3.0-8.5% under the B1 scenario, based on the PCM model.
    In the long term, output is projected to decrease by 14.8-45.6% under the A2 scenario,
    15.8-45.7% under the A1B scenario, and 16.1-36.0% under the B1 scenario, based
    on the UKMO-HadCM3 model. Output would decrease by 11.9-20.8% under the A2 scenario,
    13.5-21.9% under the A1B scenario, and 2.8-8.9% under the B1 scenario, based on
    the PCM model.
  17: Industrial output in China is projected to decrease by 3-36% before the end
    of this century under the slowest warming scenario and decrease by 12-46% under
    the most rapid warming scenario under the climate models UKMO-HadCM3 and PCM.
