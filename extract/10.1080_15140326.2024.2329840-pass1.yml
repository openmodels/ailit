Drivers of Risk:
  3: Temperature shocks (deviations from historical average temperatures) are used
    as a proxy for climate change.
  4: Temperature shocks (deviations from historical average temperatures)
  7: Temperature shocks (high temperatures).
  8: Temperature shocks as a proxy for climate change; expansionary and tight monetary
    policy.
  10: Quarterly temperature shocks, computed as temperatures that deviate from historical
    30/25/20-year moving averages
  12: Temperature shocks (high and low regimes representing hotter and cooler periods
    relative to historical averages); Positive and negative monetary policy shocks
  13: Temperature shocks (tempv_30, tempv_25, tempv_20) deviating from historical
    moving averages and monetary policy shocks.
  14: Temperature shocks (tempv_30, tempv_25, tempv_20) and monetary policy shocks
    (M21) are drivers of risk, with temperature shocks defined as deviations from
    historical moving averages.
  17: Temperature shocks (deviations from historical moving averages), monetary policy
    shocks.

Highlights:
  3: Expansionary monetary policy is less efficient and the negative impact of tight
    monetary policy is enhanced when climate change (temperature shocks) is severe.
  4: The influence of monetary policy is climate change regime dependent; Temperature
    shocks weaken the efficiency of monetary expansions and worsen the effects of
    monetary tightening; Asymmetries between expansionary and tight monetary policies
    are more apparent under high-temperature regimes; Climate change affects the effectiveness
    of monetary policy by exacerbating credit constraints of commercial banks.
  7: High temperatures weaken firm profitability, increase default probabilities of
    bank loans, and result in higher bank non-performing loan ratios. These consequences
    make banks more risk averse and prudent in expanding credit, dampening the efficiency
    of monetary policies (climate-induced credit constraint).
  8: Climate change (proxied by temperature shocks) affects the efficiency of monetary
    policy.
  12: Temperature shocks weaken the efficiency of monetary expansions and worsen the
    effects of monetary tightening; The effect of monetary expansion is less efficient
    when temperatures are higher; Output is more sensitive to negative monetary shocks
    under high-temperature regimes.
  13: Climate change (operationalized through temperature shocks) leads to larger
    fluctuations in economic outputs (GDP) and lengthens the duration of divergence
    to steady states.
  14: The impact of monetary policy shocks on GDP varies depending on the temperature
    regime (high vs. low). The paper tests if the initial assumption about the ordering
    of the variables matters, as economic growth can influence carbon dioxide emissions
    and climate.
  17: The effect of monetary policy on GDP is dependent on the temperature regime
    (high vs. low). Results are robust to using industrial production as an alternative
    output measure and using monthly data.
  18: High temperatures weaken firm profitability, increase default probabilities
    of bank loans, and result in higher bank non-performing loan ratios, leading to
    a climate-induced credit constraint that weakens the efficiency of monetary policies.
  19: The effect of monetary policy shocks on output (GDP_ind) differs depending on
    whether temperature shocks are in a high or low regime. The graphs show how GDP_ind
    responds to M21 under different temperature deviations (30, 25, 20-year moving
    averages).
  20: Increases in temperature shocks impede bank lending. The impulse responses of
    output to monetary policy shocks differ under high and low temperature regimes.
  21: Temperature shocks increase the non-performing loan ratio of commercial banks,
    suggesting a credit channel through which climate change may affect monetary policy.
  22: Tight monetary policy has stronger effects in high-temperature regimes; climate-induced
    credit constraints weaken the credit channel of monetary policy transmissions.
  24: None
  25: Climate risks can impact market efficiency; natural disasters can damage banks
    and affect firm investment; weather and climate impact total factor productivity;
    climate change has long-term macroeconomic effects.
Methodology:
  3: A threshold vector autoregression model (TVAR) is used to estimate the impact
    of expansionary and tight monetary shocks on economic output under high and low
    regimes of temperature shocks.
  4: The paper uses a Time-Varying Autoregressive (TVAR) framework to analyze the
    impact of monetary policy on economic output under different temperature regimes.
    It uses temperature shocks as a threshold variable to define climate change regimes
    (high and low temperatures). The analysis includes monetary policy (M2), output
    (GDP), and price level (CPI) as endogenous variables. Generalized impulse responses
    of output to positive and negative monetary shocks are estimated under high- and
    low-temperature regimes.

    impact of climate change on the transmission of monetary policy. Explores the
    link between temperature shocks, firm profitability, and bank lending behavior.

    responses of output (GDP) to monetary policy shocks conditional on high- and low-temperature
    shocks. The temperature shocks are defined as quarterly temperatures that deviate
    from 30/25/20-year moving averages.
  14: A Time-Varying AutoRegression (TVAR) model is used to analyze the relationship
    between monetary policy, temperature shocks, and GDP. The model's ordering of

    high vs. low temperature regimes.
  17: TVAR (Time-Varying Coefficient Vector Autoregression) model is used to analyze
    the impulse responses of GDP to monetary policy shocks under high and low-temperature

    are used for robustness checks.
  18: A Time-Varying VAR (TVAR) model is used to analyze the impulse responses of
    output to monetary policy shocks under varying temperature conditions. Equations
    (4)-(6) are used to empirically examine the climate-induced credit constraint.

    of output to monetary policy shocks under high and low-temperature shocks. Regression

    functions of temperature shocks and bank-level controls.
  20: The study uses a Time-Varying Autoregressive (TVAR) model to analyze the impulse
    responses of output to monetary policy shocks under different temperature regimes.

  21: Panel regressions with bank-level data, using temperature deviations from historical
    moving averages as climate shock proxies. The analysis aims to test for a credit
    channel, where temperature shocks affect monetary policy through their impact
    on bank loan portfolios. The time span is not given on this page.
  22: Analysis is performed using a TVAR model incorporating both daily and quarterly
    frequency variables, with future potential to use mixed-frequency data sampling
    models.

More Notes:
  3: "The mechanism is explained by the climate-induced credit constraint of commercial\
    \ banks; higher temperature shocks lead to increases in banks\u2019 non-performing\
    \ loan ratios, which results in larger credit constraints of banks and weakens\
    \ the bank credit channel of monetary policy transmissions."
  4: The study suggests that policymakers should consider climate change in monetary
    policy formulations proactively. Expansionary monetary policy could be more aggressive
    when temperatures are higher, and tight monetary policy could be more conservative
    when climate change is severe.
