Drivers of Risk:
  3: No direct shocks or changes relevant to climate impacts are discussed.
  4: Discusses long-term impacts, including those continued beyond initial activity,
    such as emissions and climate change.
Evaluation overview:
  2: The paper discusses the importance of considering environmental impacts and sustainability
    in economic welfare evaluations using Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA).
  3: No specific overview of a direct climate impact evaluation is provided.
  4: No specific overview of the outcome being evaluated, but discusses impacts on
    welfare and infrastructure.
Highlights:
  2: Stresses the necessity of integrating strong sustainability guidance from natural
    sciences into CBA, requiring systemic and holistic approaches across different
    system levels.
  3: Notes a trend toward lower discount rates and mentions the importance of co-benefits
    in analyzing projects with environmental impacts.
  5: The paper highlights the need for longer time horizons in CBA to capture long-term
    environmental costs and benefits. It notes that the UK Green Book recommends a
    10-year time horizon for many interventions, but suggests longer periods (up to
    60 years or more) for significant assets or issues like climate change risks.
    It further discusses international practices regarding time horizons in CBA, including
    France (up to 2140), the UK (declining discount rates), and others.
  6: Discounted net benefits significantly increase with the use of lower discount
    rates, illustrating the impact of time horizon and discount rate choices.
  7: Longer analysis periods, such as 100 to 120 years, significantly impact the evaluation
    of public projects, potentially changing net welfare losses to net benefits.
Methodology:
  2: Focuses on the evolution of CBA, particularly in incorporating sustainability
    science and the environment, with an emphasis on appropriate time horizons and
    valuation methods to account for natural and social capital.
  3: Discusses the use of ecosystem services valuation and Total Economic Value (TEV)
    approach in cost-benefit analyses.
  4: Advocates for long time horizons in CBA to assess long-term welfare impacts and
    address ethical implications.
  5: This paper discusses the importance of long-term time horizons in Cost-Benefit
    Analyses (CBA), particularly for projects with long-term implications, citing
    examples from various countries and organizations. It also mentions the use of
    declining discount rates to account for long-term impacts and the value of future
    generations, while acknowledging uncertainty.
  6: The analysis uses different time horizons and discount rates, applied to a constant
    annual benefit flow of $1000, to calculate discounted net benefits.
  7: The analysis emphasizes using extended time horizons in cost-benefit analysis
    (CBA) for public projects to better account for long-term impacts and benefits.
More Notes:
  3: Emphasizes the significance of equity and distributional considerations in cost-benefit
    analysis.
  7: The paper suggests that short time horizons in analyses may result in a 'pessimism
    bias' for environmentally beneficial projects and an 'optimism bias' for environmentally
    damaging ones.
  8: This page is part of the references and acknowledgements section of the paper
    and does not contain any relevant information beyond that.
Quantitative material:
  3: Includes information about discount rates for different OECD countries and their
    potential decline over time.
  6: Table 2 presents the effect of discount rates on long-term financial flows; it
    shows percentage increases in net benefits when moving to lower rates, such as
    79.07% at 1.4% and 93.92% at a zero discount rate.
