  4: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  4: Emission or avoidance of greenhouse gases from energy and transport projects;
    Long-term impacts such as climate change damages and biodiversity loss
  6: Discount rates, time horizon.
Highlights:
  4: Long time horizons must be applied to estimate welfare impacts; Ignoring or excessively
    discounting the long-term impacts is ethically indefensible; CBA should capture
    all future costs and benefits to welfare.
  6: Discount rates and time horizons have a considerable impact on discounted net
    benefits; lower discount rates lead to significantly higher net present values,
    especially over longer time horizons.
Methodology:
  4: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) with a focus on incorporating long time horizons
    to capture long-term costs and benefits to welfare, rather than just financial
    implications; Scenario approaches to explore key uncertainties in forecasting
    future costs and benefits.
  6: Cost-benefit analysis employing different time horizons and constant discount
    rates to calculate the net present value of a constant annual benefit flow.
More Notes:
  4: The time horizon of analysis can significantly affect the outcome of results
    of CBA; The actual impacts of a project depend not only on what it is, and how
    it is designed, but into what receiving context it is placed; Applying short time
    horizons to long-term impacts, in defensive response to uncertainty, appears...
  6: The analysis uses constant discount rates, including 1.4% (Stern) and 0%, to
    explore the impact on NPV. The example illustrates the sensitivity of CBA results
    to the chosen discount rate and time horizon.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  6: The effect of different discount rates and time horizons on the net present value
    of a constant annual benefit flow of $1000 USD.
Quantitative material:
  6: Table 2 shows the effect of time horizon (25, 50, 100, 120 years) and discount
    rates (7%, 5%, 3%, 1.4%, 0%) on a constant long-term flow of $1000 USD per annum,
    with specific NPV values for each combination. Over a 25-year period, moving from
    a 7% discount rate to a 3% discount rate increases net benefits by $5,723, or
    48.84%. Moving to the Stern discount rate of 1.4% or a 0% discount rate, increases
    the discounted net benefits to $20,985 and $25,000 respectively, representing
    increases of 79.07% and 93.92% from the 7% discount rate.
