Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (temperature increases, shifts in climate patterns).
  2: Climate change impacts on crop yields. Socio-economic effects associated with
    biophysical changes in crop yields induced by climate factors. Weather shocks.
  7: Crop-mix land use shares are impacted by average growing season temperature (GrsAvg),
    precipitation (Precip), irrigation rate (IrrigRate.lag), time trend, pesticide
    use (Pesticide.lag), fertilizer use (Fertilizer.lag), farm revenue (FarmRev.lag),
    planted scale (PlantedScale.lag), mean growing season temperature (meanGrs), and
    mean precipitation (meanPrep).
  9: GrsAvg (Growing Season Average Temperature), Precip (Precipitation), IrrigRate.lag
    (Lagged Irrigation Rate), Pesticide.lag (Lagged Pesticide Use), Fertilizer.lag
    (Lagged Fertilizer Use), FarmRev.lag (Lagged Farm Revenue), PlantedScale.lag (Lagged
    Planted Scale), meanGrs (Mean Growing Season Temperature), meanPrep (Mean Precipitation)
  11: Growing season temperature and annual total precipitation.
  12: "Increased global average temperatures (specifically +0.72, +1.22, and +2.22\xB0\
    C above the 20th century average, representing +1.5\xB0C, +2.0\xB0C, and +3.0\xB0\
    C warming scenarios) impacting crop area shares."
  13: "Future warming scenarios (+1.5\xB0C, +2\xB0C, +3\xB0C) impacting crop suitability\
    \ and geographic distribution."
  14: Increases in temperature and climate change are anticipated to impact future
    crop mix and affect regional agricultural production.
  15: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: Temperature increases are projected to raise the incidence of wheat and tubers
    while reducing that for rice and maize. Cash crops and fiber-producing crops will
    increase, whereas oil-bearing crops and specialty crops will decrease.
  2: Climate change negatively impacts corn and soybean yields, leading to economic
    losses and potential shifts in cropland use.
  5: No relevant information
  7: Growing season average temperature squared (GrsAvg2) shows a statistically significant
    negative impact on maize land use share, and a statistically significant positive
    impact on wheat and oilseed land use share. Precipitation shows statistically
    significant negative impacts on tuber land use share and statistically significant
    positive impacts on precipitation squared.
  9: Growing season average temperature (GrsAvg) has a statistically significant negative
    impact on Maize production. Precipitation has a statistically significant positive
    impact on Rice production, and negative impact on Tubers, Vege and Orchards. Lagged
    irrigation rate (IrrigRate.lag) has a statistically significant positive impact
    on Rice, Wheat, Oils, Cotton, and Vege production, and negative impact on Maize
    and Tubers. Lagged planted scale (PlantedScale. lag) has a statistically significant
    positive impact on Rice and Cotton production, and negative impact on Wheat, Tubers
    and Oils and Vege. Mean growing season average temperature (meanGrs) has a statistically
    significant negative impact on Rice, and positive impact on Orchards. Mean precipitation
    (meanPrep) has a statistically significant positive impact on Rice, and negative
    impact on Maize and Wheat.
  11: Growing season temperature has a positive impact on the area share of tubers
    and orchards, and a negative impact on oilseeds, vegetables, and specialty crops.
    Annual total precipitation has a positive impact on the area share of tubers and
    vegetables, and a negative impact on the area share of orchards, oilseeds, and
    specialty crops.
  12: Warming is projected to decrease the area shares of cereals (including rice
    and maize), oil-bearing crops (including soybeans and oilseed crops), and specialty
    crops. The area shares of food crops (including wheat and tubers), fiber-producing
    crops (including cotton and other fiber crops), and cash crops (such as vegetables
    and orchards) will increase. Vegetables and orchards are projected to experience
    expansions, especially in southern regions that are currently major rice-producing
    regions.
  13: Significant regional shifts in agricultural land use are projected under future
    warming scenarios. Some crops are projected to expand in area while others contract,
    depending on the region and warming scenario.
  14: Climate change impacts on crop mix will vary by crop. Under future climate change
    wheat and tuber crops are likely to expand should no intervention take place,
    whereas rice may not step in as an alternative.
