Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature frequency
  2: Temperature frequency and intensity, specifically increases in hot days due to
    global warming.
  4: Frequency of moderate cold, extreme cold, moderate hot, and extreme hot temperatures
  5: The normalized frequency of temperature (specifically, temperature frequency
    relative to the 100th percentile of frequency distribution) is the primary driver
    of mortality risk.
Highlights:
  1: Assessing adaptation to local temperature
  2: Populations can adapt to their local climate with frequent exposure to temperature,
    and adapting ability varies geographically due to climatic and socioeconomic differences.
    Increased temperature frequency is associated with a declining risk of mortality.
  4: There is a significant and positive association between the frequency of temperature
    and mortality, with an overall increase of 13.03% in mortality risk when comparing
    the 10th percentile to the 100th percentile of normalized frequency. Extreme cold
    has the highest impact on mortality risk.
  5: Higher temperature frequency is associated with increased mortality risk. Temperate
    climates and high-income countries show the highest increase in mortality risk
    related to temperature frequency.
Methodology:
  1: Multi-Country Multi-City (MCC) Collaborative Network
  2: "Two-stage time series design using daily mortality and temperature data from\
    \ 757 locations in 47 countries/regions during 1979\u20132020. Results were pooled\
    \ at national, regional, and global levels."
  4: "A model was used to extract exposure\u2013response associations for each temperature\
    \ component, and a second stage was repeated to pool the overall cumulative exposure\u2013\
    response associations for each temperature component. Sensitivity analyses were\
    \ conducted using alternative maximum lag days of frequency (from 21 to 24 and\
    \ 28 days) and alternative dfs for both the lag-response curve of frequency (from\
    \ 3 to 4, 5, and 6) and long-term time trends (from 6 to 7 and 8)."
  5: The study uses pooled cumulative associations to analyze the relationship between
    temperature frequency and all-cause mortality. Stratification is performed by
    climatic zones and socio-economic status (income level).
More Notes:
  1: The study uses data from a Multi-Country Multi-City collaborative network to
    analyze the relationship between temperature frequency and mortality. It is an
    article and not a comprehensive macroeconomic analysis.
  2: The paper suggests that adaptation to temperature occurs, potentially mitigating
    some of the negative impacts of climate change on mortality. The study highlights
    the importance of local context in understanding climate change impacts and adaptation
    strategies.
  4: The study included 120,758,598 deaths across 757 locations from 47 countries/regions.
    The lag structure of temperature effects on mortality attenuates drastically to
    lag day 21.
  5: The French Reunion is the only location included in sub-Saharan Africa for region-specific
    analysis. The study considers lag effects up to 20 days. Relative risks decrease
    over time at the 10th percentile of temperature frequency.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Mortality
  2: Mortality risk (as a proxy for the impact of temperature on human capital and
    potentially productivity).
  4: Mortality risk
  5: All-cause mortality risk is the primary outcome considered.

  2: "Average increase in mortality risk comparing the 10th to 100th percentile of\
    \ normalized frequency was 13.03% (95% CI: 12.17\u201313.91), with substantial\
    \ regional differences (from 4.56% in Australia and New Zealand to 33.06% in South\
    \ Europe). The highest increase in mortality was observed for high-income countries\
    \ (13.58%, 95% CI: 12.56\u201314.61), followed by lower-middle-income countries\
    \ (12.34%, 95% CI: 9.27\u201315.51)."
  5: 'Temperate climates (C) exhibited the highest increase in mortality risk, with
    a percentage change of 14.79 (95% CI: 13.61, 15.99). Polar climates (E) showed
    the lowest increase of -0.45 (95% CI: -1.91, 12.50). High-income countries showed
    the highest increase in mortality risk, with a percentage change of 13.58% (95%
    CI: 12.56, 14.61).'
