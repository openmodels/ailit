Drivers of Risk:
  3: Temperature frequency (number of days for each specific temperature) is the main
    driver of risk evaluated, with consideration of moderate and extreme cold/hot
    temperatures.
  4: Frequency of temperature, categorized into moderate cold, extreme cold, moderate
    hot, and extreme hot.
  5: The paper evaluates the impact of temperature frequency on all-cause mortality.
  7: Changes in temperature frequency impact mortality risk, with different impacts
    observed for extreme cold, extreme hot, moderate cold, and moderate hot temperature
    components.
  8: Exposure to cold and hot temperatures, frequency of temperature exposure, climate
    zone
  9: Increased temperature frequency.
  10: Ambient temperature and heatwaves
Evaluation overview:
  3: Evaluates the association between temperature frequency and mortality risk.
  4: Mortality risk is evaluated in relation to temperature frequency.
  5: The paper provides an overview of mortality risks associated with temperature
    frequency.
  7: The study evaluates the relationship between temperature frequency and all-cause
    mortality.
  8: Mortality
  9: This study concerns the health consequences of temperature.
  10: Mortality
Highlights:
  3: Investigates the modification effect of temperature on the frequency-mortality
    association.
  4: The association between temperature frequency and mortality varies among regions,
    with South Europe showing the greatest decrease in mortality with an increase
    in temperature frequency.
  5: The highest mortality risk increase is observed in temperate climates, while
    polar climates have the lowest increase.
  7: Increased frequency of temperatures, particularly extreme cold and hot, is associated
    with increased mortality risk; frequency offers a consistent mortality risk measure
    across geographical locations according to the study's results.
  8: Human adaptation to temperature varies depending on temperature components; greater
    reduction in mortality risk associated with increased frequency for cold temperatures
    compared to hot. Climate zone is an important determinant of frequency-related
    mortality risk. High-income countries exhibited the highest RR comparing the 10th
    percentile (less frequent) versus the 100th percentile (most frequent) of the
    normalized temperature frequency.
  9: Populations can adapt to their local climate through frequent exposure to increased
    temperatures.
  10: Wu et al. (2022) studied global, regional, and national burden of mortality
    associated with short-term temperature variability from 2000-2019.
Methodology:
  3: 'Uses a two-stage time-series quasi-Poisson regression design with distributed
    lag non-linear model (DLNM). First stage: location-specific association between
    mortality and normalized frequency of temperature. Second stage: pools location-specific
    estimates using a multilevel meta-analytical model. Stratification analysis by
    temperature.'
  4: "Pooled exposure\u2013response curves were reconstructed for four distinct periods\
    \ (1990\u20131995, 1995\u20132000, 2000\u20132005, and 2005\u20132010)."
  5: Mortality risks are compared at various percentiles of temperature frequency
    distribution, with reference to normalized frequency metrics.
  7: Temperature frequency is introduced as a concept to assess the temperature-mortality
    relationship, with data collected across multiple countries and climates.
  8: "Compares temperature-mortality associations across locations. Examines the relationship\
    \ between temperature frequency and human health. Uses K\xA8oppen climate classification."
  9: Secondary analysis of aggregate anonymized data from the MCC Collaborative Research
    Network.
  10: Three-stage modelling study (Wu et al., 2022).
More Notes:
  3: The study uses data from 757 locations across 47 countries from the Multi-Country
    Multi-City (MCC) Collaborative Research Network.
  4: The maximum annual average frequency of temperature ranged from 13 days in Regina,
    Canada to 204 days in Fortaleza, Brazil.
  8: Study acknowledges limitations regarding demographic characteristics (age, sex,
    cause of death) and data availability for certain regions (Middle East, Southeast
    Asia, South Africa, Australia/New Zealand).
Quantitative material:
  3: "Presents results as percentage change of mortality comparing the 10th percentile\
    \ to the 100th percentile of normalized frequency: (RR-1) \xD7 100 %."
  4: 'Moderate hot results in an increase in mortality risk of 2.38 % (95 % CI: 1.92,
    2.85).'
  5: The paper mentions percentage changes in mortality risk for different climate
    zones and income levels, such as a 14.79% increase in temperate climates and a
    13.58% increase in high-income countries.
  7: "Table 1 provides percentage change in mortality comparing the 10th to the 100th\
    \ percentile of normalized frequency of temperature, with values ranging from\
    \ \u22120.45% to 14.79% depending on the climate zone."
  8: Higher relative risk (RR) observed for extreme cold than extreme hot temperatures,
    comparing the 10th percentile of frequency to the 100th percentile of frequency.
  10: "The paper by Y. Wu et al. (2022) in Lancet Planet. Health 6, e410\u2013e421\
    \ quantifies the global, regional, and national burden of mortality associated\
    \ with short-term temperature variability from 2000\u201319."
