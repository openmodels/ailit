Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (temperature and precipitation fluctuations), population pressure.
  3: Temperature and precipitation anomalies indicate climate-related risks.
  5: Temperature, precipitation, population.
  6: Climate change and population change in late imperial China.
  7: Social crises such as rebellions and invasions, as well as temperature, precipitation,
    and population changes, impact the economy.
  8: Climate change is identified as a significant influence on economic vulnerabilities,
    particularly when population size increases.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change induces economic fluctuations in late imperial China, particularly
    in the long term; Temperature has a greater influence on the economy than precipitation;
    The population of China is statistically proven to primarily act as consumers
    in the long term; The economic vulnerability in late imperial China under climate
    change is further increased and is higher than that in early modern Europe.
  3: Long-term trends in GDP per capita and real price are highlighted through low-pass
    filtering of historical data.
  5: Temperature and population have a significant impact on both real GDP per capita
    and rice price. The agrarian economy in late imperial China has a stronger link
    with temperature than with population.
  6: Climate change dominated real GDP per capita and rice prices in late imperial
    China; temperature had a more significant impact than precipitation.
  7: Significant impact of social crisis and climate variability on economic well-being
    during transitional period of Ming and Qing dynasties.
  8: A larger population size in regions similar to late imperial China increases
    socioeconomic vulnerability due to the role of population as consumers.
Methodology:
  1: "Quantitative analysis of the relationship between climate change and the economy\
    \ in late imperial China (AD 1600\u20131840) at the national level using multivariate\
    \ regression and Granger causality analyses."
  3: Analysis includes raw and low-pass filtered time-series data, with a focus on
    long-term trends from historical climatic proxy series.
  5: Regression analysis and Granger causality analysis (GCA) using low-pass filtered
    data.  Lag for the climate change-economy relationship is set to 1.
  6: Regression analysis and Generalized Cross-validation (GCA) used to study the
    impact of population and climate on the economy.
  7: The study uses a multivariate regression model with a crisis period variable
    on real GDP per capita to assess economic effects.
More Notes:
  1: "The study uses rice price as an economic indicator; The study aims to revisit\
    \ Malthusian theory and \u2018Great Divergence\u2019 theory by including the perspective\
    \ of economic vulnerability under climate change."
  5: Precipitation is only significantly related to real GDP per capita. The negative
    coefficient of population implies a larger population size decreases real GDP
    per capita. The negative coefficient of temperature indicates that a warm climate
    increases the supply of agricultural products, averting price increases.
  6: Population growth dampened the buffering capacity of the economy in late imperial
    China.
  7: The study discusses macroscale economic vulnerabilities due to climate change
    and social crisis in historical China.
  8: The study suggests that scale influences the understanding of socioeconomic vulnerabilities,
    where different scales bring various social and economic dynamics.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Real GDP per capita is used as a measure of economic outcome.
  3: GDP per capita and real price index are discussed as economic indicators.
  5: Real GDP per capita, rice price.
  6: Climate change affects real GDP per capita and rice prices in late imperial China,
    with significant long-term effects.
  7: Real GDP per capita negatively affected during social crisis linked to climate
    and historical events.
Quantitative Material:
  3: Graphs provide visual data on temperature, precipitation, GDP per capita, real
    price, and population from 1500 to 1840.
Quantitative material:
  1: Multivariate regression and Granger causality analyses are used to quantify the
    relationship between climate change and economic fluctuations.
  5: 'Table 1: Regression model on real GDP per capita shows coefficients for temperature
    (0.117), precipitation (0.181), and population (-5.67E-06) are significant. Adjusted
    R2 = 0.934. Table 2: Regression model on rice price shows coefficients for temperature
    (-0.253) and population (1.23E-05) are significant. Adjusted R2 = 0.799. Table
    3: Granger causality analysis results on climate change, agrarian economy, and
    population pressure.'
  6: Temperature has a greater influence than precipitation on the agrarian economy;
    population acts mainly as a consumer, raising rice prices.
  7: "Regression model indicates crisis period from AD 1643\u20131662 decreases real\
    \ GDP per capita in late imperial China, with Crisis variable coefficient of -0.229."
