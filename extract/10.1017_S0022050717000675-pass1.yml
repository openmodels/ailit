Drivers of Risk:
  1: Weather (temperature and precipitation).
  2: Average temperature and rainfall.
  3: Variations in temperature and rainfall; interannual weather fluctuations in early
    childhood.
  5: Climatic factors, environmental factors, economic factors, and agronomic variables
    affecting land productivity; global warming; temperature and precipitation.
  6: Global warming; extreme heat; climatic challenges; soil erosion
  7: Historical weather variables (monthly mean temperature and monthly accumulated
    precipitation).
  8: Long-term weather conditions (temperature and precipitation).
  9: Decadal average of county annual mean temperature; Decadal average of county
    annual accumulated precipitation
  10: Temperature and annual accumulated precipitation
  12: 10-year average of annual mean temperature and annual accumulated precipitation
    prior to each census year (from 1880-2000), relative to 1870.
  13: Hot and rainy weather
  14: Temperature (T) and Precipitation (P)
  16: Short-term weather conditions measured by annual mean temperature (T) and accumulated
    precipitation (P) in the census year
  17: Changes in temperature and precipitation (weather variables)
  18: Short-term weather conditions (average temperature and accumulated precipitation)
  19: Decadal temperature, decadal precipitation, annual temperature, annual precipitation
  20: Annual and decadal average weather variables (temperature and precipitation),
    extreme weather conditions
  21: Decadal and annual temperature and precipitation changes.
  23: Climate and climate change affecting activities and lifetime health of individuals
    by causing malnutrition from crop failure, spreading infectious diseases, distorting
    health conditions, changing ecological systems, and extreme temperature in utero.
  24: Early-life weather conditions, specifically long-term temperature and precipitation
    experienced in early life, impact later adult occupational income.
  26: Annual mean temperature and accumulated precipitation in each state during early
    life (years around birth).
  27: Cross-year weather fluctuations, specifically temperature and precipitation,
    in early life (one year after birth for temperature, year of birth for precipitation).
  28: Short-term weather fluctuations, specifically temperature and precipitation
    at a specific time in early life.
  34: Climate (weather variables).
Highlights:
  1: The effects of hotter and wetter weather on productivity were stronger earlier
    in U.S. history than in recent decades, suggesting estimates from a given period
    may be of limited use in forecasting the longer-term impacts of climate change.
  2: In the late 1800s, farm value per acre had an inverse U-shape relationship with
    average temperature.  By the second half of the twentieth century, farm value
    per acre increased monotonically with average temperature.  More average rain
    predicted lower farm values in the nineteenth century but higher values by the
    middle of the twentieth century.
  3: The relationship between weather and farm productivity, and weather in early
    life and later-life human capital, has changed over time, suggesting adaptation
    to climate. Effects of weather on farm productivity and occupational income were
    stronger in the past but are now considerably weaker.
  5: The hedonic approach can confound climate with other regional factors that happen
    to be correlated with climate measures, leading to omitted variable bias.
  6: Meaningful adaptation takes place over a long time span and direct evidence of
    adaptation requires observation over longer periods of time.
  8: County farm value has adapted to the permanent features of local weather over
    time in the United States.
  10: The relevance of temperature and precipitation to farm value changed across
    decades, suggesting adaptation. High temperatures and high precipitation initially
    depressed farm value, but this negative association weakened over time and even
    reversed in recent decades. Adaptation to hot and wet weather can be observed
    over longer time periods and has occurred gradually.
  12: Historical patterns suggest that adaptation to hot and rainy weather slowed
    in recent decades. The estimated coefficients depend on the use of fixed effects.
    County fixed effects models estimate smaller effects of weather on farm value
    than year or state-by-year fixed effects models.
  13: The effect of hot and rainy weather on farm value substantially changed over
    the past two centuries, primarily during the first half of the twentieth century.
    The change in the effect of weather variables on farm value between the 19th and
    20th centuries is statistically significant.
  14: "Temperature and precipitation have statistically significant impacts on county\
    \ average farm values. The effect of temperature and precipitation on county farm\
    \ values appears to have changed from the 19th to the 20th century, as indicated\
    \ by the statistically significant coefficients on interaction terms with a dummy\
    \ variable for the 19th century (T \xD7 D19, P \xD7 D19)."
  16: "The impact of temperature and precipitation on farm output value per acre varies\
    \ between the 19th and 20th centuries, and across different fixed effect specifications;\
    \ The significance and magnitude of the coefficients on temperature (T) and precipitation\
    \ (P), and their interactions (T \xD7 D19, P \xD7 D19), change depending on the\
    \ time period and model specification; The interaction term (T-Tm) \xD7 (P-Pm)\
    \ is sometimes significant, suggesting that the combined effect of temperature\
    \ and precipitation deviates from an additive model"
  17: Adaptation occurred more rapidly in hotter areas over time. Adaptation to precipitation
    was evident in wetter areas.
  18: Adaptation of farm output value to weather occurred more-or-less steadily across
    decades.
  19: There is a statistically significant negative relationship between temperature
    and precipitation (both decadal and annual) and farm value/output. The regressions
    find significant coefficients for various weather variables.
  20: Adaptation in the relationship between annual temperature and farm output value
    is estimated more substantially for small-scale agricultural counties; the use
    of farm value or output value per county area gives similar but slightly smaller
    results compared to value per farmland acre, suggesting a minor influence of unsettled
    lands
  21: Temperature and precipitation changes have a statistically significant negative
    impact on farm productivity, as measured by farm value and output value. The analysis
    accounts for potential double counting of farm output and discounts crop values.
  23: Climate change is predicted to be detrimental to human life and can reduce individuals'
    economic productivity.
  24: For cohorts born before 1900, adult income decreases with higher temperature
    and precipitation in their state of birth, while for those born after 1930 this
    relationship diminishes, suggesting technological adaptation.
  26: Early-life weather conditions (temperature and precipitation) have a statistically
    significant relationship with occupational income in adulthood. The relationship
    is summarized in Figure 4.
  27: Adult occupational income scores are highly associated with cross-year weather
    fluctuations for specific years in early life.  The year in which temperature
    has the most substantial, significant effect on adult occupational income is one
    year after birth; the effect declines over the next two years. The effect of precipitation
    is most substantial at the year of birth and then becomes non-significant.
  28: The effect of short-term weather fluctuations on adult income diminished across
    cohorts; substantial positive effects among nineteenth-century cohorts attenuated
    by the early twentieth century.
  32: The estimated and actual weather variables are statistically the same, demonstrated
    through high correlation coefficients and acceptance of the null hypothesis in
    statistical tests.
  34: Examines the relationship between climate and farm productivity over a long
    historical period in the US.
  36: The paper examines the effects of long-term temperature and precipitation on
    farm value using data from 1880 to 2000.
Methodology:
  1: "Cross-sectional and panel methods are used to document the responses of agricultural\
    \ and individual productivity to weather across U.S. history (1860\u20132000)."
  2: Analysis of geospatial data on average weather conditions and historical weather
    information matched to economic variables at the county and state levels in the
    US.  Uses cross-sectional and panel/fixed effects models.
  3: Panel fixed effect methods; Matching long-term weather variables (decade level)
    with farm value and short-term weather variables (annual averages) with farm output
    value; Census sample of cohorts born from 1880 to 1920; Fixed effect estimator.
  5: Hedonic regression (running a regression of farm value on climatic, environmental,
    economic, and agronomic variables to estimate the discounted marginal value or
    price sensitivity of these factors to land productivity). Fixed effects model
    using across-year variation in temperature and precipitation within counties to
    estimate the effect of climate change on agricultural profits and yields. Panel
    data analysis of crop yields and daily weather variables.
  6: Uses a 140-year time window to study technological adaptation to weather, combining
    hedonic and fixed effects methods.
  7: Uses geostatistical technique called 'Kriging' to estimate weather variables
    for counties without weather stations, based on inverse distance squared weighting
    of surrounding stations. Panel data analysis relating farm productivity to weather
    variables at the county level.
  8: Cross-sectional analysis using scatter plots to investigate the historical relationships
    between county average farm value and weather conditions. Adjusts county variables
    from 1880 to 2000 on the 1870 county boundary using the area-weighted average
    method. Uses an unbalanced panel of cohorts defined by year and state of birth.
  9: The analysis uses farm statistics from historical census records and Kriging
    interpolated weather variables. Lowess fit curves and linear fit lines are used
    to model the relationship between weather variables and farm value per acre.
  10: Bivariate cross-sectional analysis using decadal averages of temperature and
    precipitation to explain county farm value. Fixed-effects model as a complementary
    approach. Analysis covers the period from the late 19th century to recent decades.
  12: Weighted regressions of the logarithm of county average farm value are run on
    weather variables, standard controls, and interactions with census year dummies.
    Fixed effects are used (year, state-by-year, and county). Analysis uses county
    boundary adjusted data.
  13: The authors use weighted regressions of county farm value on decadal weather
    variables, controlling for other factors and state fixed effects, to estimate
    the effect of weather on farm value in different time periods. They also use state
    by year fixed effects and county fixed effects in some specifications.
  14: Panel data regression analysis is used to assess the impact of long-term weather
    conditions (temperature and precipitation) on county average farm values per acre.
    The analysis is conducted for the 19th and 20th centuries, both separately and
    combined. Models include state, state-century, state-year and county fixed effects.
  16: Panel data regression analysis with different fixed effects (State, State x
    Century, State x Year, County) is used to estimate the relationship between short-term
    weather conditions and county average farm output value per acre; regressions
    are run separately for the 19th century, 20th century, and both centuries combined;
    the effect of interactions between temperature and precipitation is also investigated
  17: Regression analysis of county farm value on decadal temperature and precipitation
    and their interaction. Simulation based on estimated coefficients to compare farm
    value changes in counties with different temperature/precipitation levels over
    time.
  18: "Panel regression comparing 1870\u20131900 to 1970\u20132000, including state-by-year\
    \ and county fixed effects, using short-term weather variables (average temperature\
    \ and accumulated precipitation in the year before each census year)."
  19: Regression analysis with county-level data from 1860-2000, using ordinary least
    squares (OLS), with different specifications including alternative weather variables
    and controls for large-scale agricultural counties. Weighted regressions used.
    Focus on centurial averages.
  20: Regression analysis using county-level data from 1860-2000; weighted regressions
    with farmland ratio as weights; regressions restricted to counties with large-scale
    or small-scale agriculture
  21: Regression analysis using county-level data from 1870, 1900, 1970 and 2000 to
    estimate the impact of temperature and precipitation on farm value and output
    value. The analysis employs alternative measures of county farm value and output
    value. Standard errors are clustered on county.
  24: The study uses cross-sectional evidence from U.S. history focusing on the relationship
    between early-life weather and later economic outcomes, particularly adult occupational
    income.
  26: Regression analysis is performed on cohort samples defined by state and year
    of birth (1860-1960) using U.S. census data (1880, 1900-1990) for native adult
    white males. The model includes fixed effects for state of birth times census
    year and year of birth times census year.
  27: Regression analysis with state of birth fixed effects to measure the effect
    of within-state, across-year variation in weather conditions around birth. Uses
    a 40-year-wide moving window to investigate how the effect of short-term weather
    fluctuations on adult income has changed across cohorts.  The sample for each
    regression includes cohorts born 20 years before and after the target year; the
    target years are between 1920 and 1980.
  28: Estimated a regression coefficient using a 40-year-wide moving window, controlling
    for temperature one year after birth and precipitation at the year of birth.
  31: Kriging technique used to interpolate monthly weather variables for counties
    lacking weather records, using a linear least squares estimation algorithm with
    a maximum distance of 200 miles between points. Analysis restricted to post-1860
    due to insufficient pre-1860 weather station data. Method validated by comparing
    estimated weather variables with actual ones for a random sample of counties,
    finding statistically similar results.
  32: The validity of Kriging estimation for weather variables is tested by comparing
    estimated values with actual values in randomly selected counties, with high correlation
    coefficients (0.9699 and 0.9683 for temperature; 0.9284 and 0.9791 for precipitation).
  34: Panel data analysis at the county level from 1870 to 2000, using fixed effects
    regressions. The analysis uses boundary-adjusted county data to address changes
    in county boundaries over time, but the paper reports that the boundary adjustment
    does not cause critical problems in estimating fixed effects models.
  36: Regression analysis using county-level data with and without adjustment for
    county boundary changes, controlling for weather variables and their interaction
    with year dummies. Standard errors are clustered at the state level.
More Notes:
  2: The study uses 140 years of US historical data.
  3: "The study focuses on instability in the weather\u2013productivity relationship\
    \ over time to measure adaptation to climate. The authors acknowledge the limitations\
    \ of analyzing specific determinants of productivity change due to a lack of historical\
    \ variables and endogeneity problems, and argue that controlling for these determinants\
    \ would obscure the measurement of historical adaptation."
  5: Land rent reflects not only the economic value of a country's adaptive activities
    for climate change but also can be affected by the relative difference in adaptation
    across countries. Climate change could affect the global supply of substitutes
    or complements for U.S.-produced goods, altering the terms of trade for the United
    States (and for its regions).
  7: Addresses a potential double-counting issue in farm output value calculation
    due to crops used for livestock feed.
  8: The occupational income score is calibrated using data from the 1950 census.
  12: Non-weather unobservable county characteristics correlated with weather conditions
    may explain a large part of observed historical patterns. Results are relative
    to the 1870 census year.
  13: The analysis focuses on assessing instability in the weather-productivity relationship
    over time as a measure of adaptation.
  14: D19 is a dummy variable for the 19th century, and Tm and Pm are not clearly
    defined in the provided text but are likely the mean temperature and precipitation.
  16: Standard errors are clustered at the county level; D19 is likely a dummy variable
    for the 19th century
  17: The interaction between temperature and precipitation increases the estimated
    magnitude of the historical changes by a small amount.
  18: The magnitude of the adaptation to the weather is similar to what was estimated
    using farm value and long-term weather variables. A forecast of the impact of
    climate change during one century made with data from the prior century would
    be problematic.
  19: The study uses data from US counties, and examines the impact of weather on
    agricultural output. The analysis seems to differentiate between counties above
    and below certain farmland area cutoffs, and also uses different time periods
    (1870 and 2000) for defining these groups.
  21: "The regression weights are the inverse value of the decadal, annual or centurial\
    \ weather estimates\u2019 standard errors, which is calculated from the Kriging\
    \ estimation."
  26: The study focuses on historical data from the U.S. and may not be directly applicable
    to other countries or time periods. The outcome variable is specific to occupational
    income of native adult white males.
  27: The association between weather and later outcomes might be attenuated in modern,
    developed countries by a sufficient year-round food supply, public programs, and
    technological adaptation.  The coefficients may vary across cohorts.
  28: The focus is on white-male cohorts born between 1880 and 1940.
  31: This page focuses on the methodology for estimating weather variables at the
    county level. It does not directly discuss macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes,
    adaptation costs/benefits, or their relationship to climate change risks. The
    paper may contain relevant information on subsequent pages.
  34: The analysis is limited by the availability of controls in the historical data.
    County-level output value data is missing for the three decades from 1910 to 1940
    in the ICPSR dataset.
  36: The regressions include year dummies and two-way clustered errors.

Quantitative material:
  1: The paper documents significant responses of agricultural and individual productivity
    to weather, and finds strong effects of hotter and wetter weather early in U.S.
    history that have been attenuated in recent decades.
  3: The response of farm-productivity measures to high temperature or rainfall is
    estimated to be more negative in the early parts of the sample than in recent
    years.
  7: Data covers the period 1860 to 2000 for weather variables and 1870 to 2000 for
    farm value (with gaps for farm output value in 1910, 1920, and 1930).

    across different decades (1880-2000). The y-axis represents the logarithm of the
    county average farm value per acre, while the x-axis represents the 10-year average
    of annual weather values prior to each census year.
  10: Quadratic relationship between temperature and farm value peaking around 50
    degrees Fahrenheit in the late nineteenth century. Precipitation threshold around
    35 inches, above which precipitation depressed farm value.
  12: Figure 2 shows the estimated effect of long-term temperature and precipitation
    on county farm value per acre graphically. R2 values are shown for different model
    specifications, ranging from 0.04 to 0.25 for temperature and approximately 0.0
    to 0.01 for precipitation.
  13: 'The paper estimates the marginal effect of temperature and precipitation on
    farm value in two periods: 1850-1900 and 1950-2000. It also assesses the statistical
    significance of the difference in marginal effects between the two periods.'
  14: "The table presents regression coefficients for the impact of temperature (T)\
    \ and precipitation (P) on the natural logarithm of county average farm value\
    \ per acre, with associated standard errors in parentheses. It includes coefficients\
    \ for interaction terms (T \xD7 D19, P \xD7 D19) and an interaction term between\
    \ temperature and precipitation ((T-Tm) \xD7 (P-Pm)). Adjusted R-squared values\
    \ are also reported."

    values, and number of observations
  17: "Cross-century difference in farm value as a ratio is estimated to be 13.7 for\
    \ the average county and 19.1 for a hot county using the coefficient of T\xD7\
    A19. Cross-century difference in farm value as a ratio is estimated to be 1.6\
    \ for a county with average annual precipitation (41.4 inches) and 1.9 for a wet\
    \ county with 51.9 inches of annual precipitation, using the coefficient of P\xD7\
    A19."
  18: Hot and rainy short-term weather was less favorable for producing agricultural
    output in the late nineteenth century than it was in the late twentieth century.

    decadal and annual) to farm value and farm output value, standard errors, number
    of observations, significance levels
  21: The table presents regression coefficients showing the impact of temperature
    and precipitation on farm value and farm output value. For example, in Panel A,
    a decadal increase in temperature (T) is associated with a statistically significant
    negative impact on farm value (Y), with a coefficient of -0.0470*** in the baseline
    model.
  24: 'The study found statistically significant negative linear relationships between
    early-life weather conditions and occupational income for nineteenth-century data:
    temperature coefficient -0.0094 (standard error 0.0020) and precipitation coefficient
    -0.0024 (standard error 0.0012).'

    range from approximately -0.015 to 0.015 for temperature and -0.005 to 0.005 for
    precipitation.
