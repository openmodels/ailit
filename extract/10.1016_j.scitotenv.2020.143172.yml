  10: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts and risk assessments need downscaled climate projections
    and context-relevant socioeconomic scenarios
  3: Climate drivers based on RCPs and UKCP18; socioeconomic drivers based on global/European
    SSPs and national knowledge.
  5: Uncertainty polarities associated with driver categories focus on describing
    the type or dynamics of transitions, rather than velocity of change; Land use
    and environmental policy (strategic and planned vs. free-for-all and unregulated);
    food security and consumption (resource-friendly vs. over-exploitative); demographic
    change (size of working population, mobility); societal attitudes (empowered vs
    disillusioned); access to health and education; digital technology and innovation
    (net damage vs net-benefit to social-ecological-economic systems); nature of the
    economy (non-monetary driven systems vs traditional money-based economy); governance
    structures (cooperation between UK nations, level of devolution); geopolitical
    and trade relations (globalization vs nationalism).
  8: Economic instability and security concerns post-Brexit, slow economic growth,
    limited technological implementation, and environmental challenges.
  10: Social inequality underpins high challenges to adaptation (in UK-SSP4).
Highlights:
  1: Development of multiscale scenarios for the UK by integrating climate and socioeconomic
    drivers, balancing consistency and legitimacy, and stakeholder-led national SSPs
    consistent with higher-level SSPs
  8: UK-SSP1 envisions a vibrant society with healthier lives and decreased waste,
    while UK-SSP3 faces major economic instability and environmental challenges, slow
    growth, and increased reliance on imports.
  10: The UK-SSPs are embedded within the global and European SSPs but include extensions
    to incorporate UK-specific drivers.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis involves the co-creation of UK versions of the Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSPs) using stakeholder inputs and integrating global/European SSPs
    with national knowledge through a participatory process
  3: Co-production process with stakeholders to develop UK-SSPs, integration of local/national
    knowledge with global SSPs, translation of scenario narratives into trends and
    projections.
  5: Story and Simulation approach which comprises iterating qualitative (participatory)
    scenarios with quantitative, modelled scenarios to obtain internally consistent
    and relevant scenarios; stakeholder workshop to develop narratives, tables of
    driver uncertainties and tables with semi-quantitative trends.
  8: The UK-SSP scenarios were developed using a combination of bottom-up and top-down
    approaches, integrating local, regional, and global socioeconomic pathways through
    a participatory process.
  10: Semi-quantitative trends were developed directly from the narratives, constrained
    by global SSP storylines and data on population and GDP.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the development of UK-specific narratives for SSPs, involving
    participatory processes that combine bottom-up and top-down approaches
  3: The paper focuses on developing a framework to integrate climate and socioeconomic
    scenarios for assessing impacts and adaptation in the UK. The UK-SSPs can be combined
    with RCP-based climate projections for wider application in climate change impact
    assessments across multiple sectors (agriculture, forestry, coasts, human health,
    built environment, biodiversity, pollution, water).
  10: The UK-SSPs focus on land use and agricultural policies, emphasizing the role
    of sub-European institutions and networks in decision-making.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  3: The paper aims to assess climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerabilities
    (CCIAV) in multiple economic and environmental sectors.
  5: Changes to the agricultural sector and potential knock-on effects for biodiversity;
    overall wealth in a society, vulnerability of the system, and the ability of society
    to cope with and adapt to changing circumstances; human and environmental health;
    and impact of technology on social-ecological-economic systems.
  8: Economic growth is slow in UK-SSP3, and there are challenges in government revenue
    generation, affecting fiscal outcomes.
  10: UK-SSP4 results in net damage to social-ecological-economic systems, despite
    overall technological development.
Quantitative material:
  1: No relevant information
  5: 'Semi-quantitative trends developed by stakeholders; Stakeholders categorized
    the scenario trends for variables in three-time slices: present to 2040; 2040
    to 2070; and 2070 to 2100 compared to current; Stakeholders were asked to discuss
    each trend within their UK-SSP group, agree on a consensus answer and draw it
    on a graph; The categories were large, moderate or small decrease, no change,
    and small, moderate or large increase; stakeholders also provided a confidence
    number ranging from 0 to 10.'
