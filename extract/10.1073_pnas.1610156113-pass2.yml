Drivers of Risk:
  3: Summer temperature and soil moisture are important growth drivers for many Canadian
    boreal tree species.
  6: Climate variability (summer temperature, soil water content, fall temperature,
    spring temperature, snowfall) and changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations are
    identified as drivers influencing tree growth.
  8: Climate effects on species-by-plot averaged residuals of Eq. 2 (GAMMLResijkt)
    were explored using linear mixed models, testing mean summer soil moisture and
    temperature, fall and spring mean temperature, cool season total snowfall, and
    mean annual atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2]).
Highlights:
  3: Soil moisture has been an important driver of tree growth in boreal Canada since
    the mid-20th century.
  6: The study quantifies the impact of climatic variables and atmospheric CO2 concentrations
    on tree growth across different tree species, accounting for species-specific
    responses and regional climate trends. The detrending method is a key highlight.
  8: The relationship between residuals and atmospheric concentrations of CO2 takes
    an inflection point at 339 ppmv, suggesting that linear-mixed model predictions
    are underestimating a potential large-scale growth enhancement in recent years.
Methodology:
  3: Growth-climate response patterns were computed for each of the 19 boreal tree
    species. Trends in forest growth are estimated using National Forest Inventory
    (NFI) tree core data and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data for
    the periods 1982-2002 and 1950-2002.
  6: The analysis uses Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) to remove internal
    biological effects on tree growth and to assess the impact of climate variables
    and CO2 on tree growth. The growth model was fitted using the mgcv package in
    R. Detrending techniques are used to address annual growth variability independently
    of biological age or tree size.
  8: Linear mixed models were used to explore the climate effects on species-by-plot
    averaged residuals. Multimodel selection was performed using the MuMIn package,
    ranking models with cumulative Akaike weights within 95% considered best. Parameter
    estimates were computed through averaging of multiple models.
More Notes:
  3: Extreme temperatures can be detrimental to plant productivity because of heat-related
    carbohydrate loss via autotrophic respiration. Summer warming has a net negative
    impact on the long-term growth trajectory of Picea mariana and Pinus banksiana.
  6: The paper focuses on the biological impacts of climate change on forests, specifically
    tree growth. The link to national-level macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes is indirect
    but could be inferred through the role of forests in timber production, carbon
    sequestration, and ecosystem services.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: No relevant information
  6: The paper assesses the impact of climatic variables and atmospheric CO2 concentrations
    on tree growth, measured as basal area increment (BAI), which could relate to
    timber productivity, forest health, and carbon sequestration potential, factors
    indirectly relevant to national-level economic productivity and natural resource
    management.

Quantitative material:
  3: Growth of all needleleaf species within the genera Abies, Picea, and Pinus (except
    Pinus strobus) was negatively influenced by warm summers in the year before tree
    growth. The same relationship was found in broadleaf species Betula papyrifera
    and Populus spp., and needleleaf Thuja occidentalis.
  6: The paper includes t-statistics for the influence of climatic variables on BAI,
    plot-level correlation coefficients between fitted estimates and the response
    variable, and equations for quantifying past annual tree growth variability (Equations
    3-6). It models BAI as a function of cambial age and tree basal area.
  8: "Linear trends for 1950\u20132002 at the species-by-ecozone level were examined;\
    \ slope estimates from regressions were used. Residuals plotted against annual\
    \ averages of atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are presented. Relationship modeled\
    \ using a piecewise regression (r = 0.42)."
