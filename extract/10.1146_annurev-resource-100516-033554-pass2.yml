Drivers of Risk:
  9: Uncertainty about future climate conditions, especially at regional and local
    levels; less information about secondary climate variables (precipitation, wind
    speeds, seasonal variations, weather extremes).
  13: Climate risks, anthropogenic climate change exceeding current climate variability,
    and climate stress on low-income households are the main drivers of risk.
  16: "Time of adaptation investment (early vs later), costs of adaptation (C), early\
    \ benefits of adaptation (B0), later benefits of adaptation (B1), and the discount\
    \ factor (\u03B4)."
  20: Climate risks; shift from agriculture to industry/services; urban development
    along coastlines; migrants ending up in neighborhoods subject to flooding.
  25: "More extreme forms of climate change associated with 3-4\xBAC of mean surface\
    \ warming; Relatively modest levels of climate variation observed in the recent\
    \ past."
  29: No relevant information
  31: Adaptation to climate change and cyclone risks; economic cost of climate-related
    events like Katrina.
Highlights:
  5: Early integrated assessment models incorporated adaptation costs and benefits
    into a damage function, representing the least-cost combination of adaptation
    costs (AC) and residual damages (RD) from climate change.
  8: Economy-wide effects of climate change deserve more attention because economic
    systems are increasingly interconnected, and indirect risks/adaptation needs may
    dominate direct effects for some sectors.
  9: Uncertainty about climate outcomes is higher for adaptation than mitigation,
    especially at regional and local levels.
  13: There is concern about the ability of low-income countries and low-income population
    groups to adapt effectively. Low-income countries often lack the institutional,
    financial, or technological capacity for effective adaptation.
  16: Adaptation might be brought forward if the net present value of acting early
    is greater than the net present value of acting later; this depends on the cost
    difference between early and late adaptation, the early benefits gained by early
    adaptation, and the discounted difference in later benefits.
  20: The effect of economic development on vulnerability and exposure is ambiguous.
    The type of development matters.
  25: "Need to understand adaptation strategies for extreme climate change (3-4\xBA\
    C warming) and how to switch between adaptation regimes."

Methodology:
  5: Integrated assessment models are used to represent economic and biophysical processes
    associated with climate change, including economic activity, emissions, atmospheric
    concentration, temperature change, physical impacts, and socio-economic consequences.
    They are global, dynamic, and long-term (100+ year time horizons).
  8: System-wide models (computable general equilibrium models, macroeconomic models,
    and input/output analysis) are used to analyze economy-wide effects and combined
    effects of adaptation to multiple climate risks.
  9: Discusses decision-making tools for adaptation under uncertainty, including situations
    of deep uncertainty where assigning probabilities to different states of the world
    is not possible. Mentions various decision making heuristics and tools that have
    been put forward.
  16: Compares the net present value (NPV) of an adaptation investment at different
    times (early vs. later) to determine optimal timing, using costs, early benefits,
    and later benefits, discounted to their present value.
  25: Policy evaluation at the sector level to understand the effectiveness of adaptation
    policies.
  29: No relevant information
  31: Adaptive regional input-output model; investment decision making under deep
    uncertainty.
More Notes:
  5: The optimality of the adaptation process was often assumed in early models, allowing
    modelers to focus on emission reduction paths or the social cost of carbon. Some
    models attempt to separately optimize adaptation and mitigation actions.
  8: General equilibrium models measure long-term impacts once the economy has adjusted,
    offering a static comparison of two equilibria, not capturing the immediate repercussions
    and short-term costs of a shock.
  18: The page primarily sets the stage for discussing the macroeconomics of adaptation,
    highlighting the need for economy-wide analysis and integration of adaptation
    into development planning. It does not present specific results.
  20: Adaptation practitioners are trying to incorporate climate risks more explicitly
    and proactively into development.
  25: Focuses on the effectiveness of adaptation policies and the need for policy
    evaluation rather than quantifying aggregate costs; Emphasizes the importance
    of understanding adaptation to extreme climate change despite the lack of empirical
    evidence.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  13: Businesses view climate change as a risk and an opportunity, with adaptation
    potentially leading to new demand for certain goods and services.
  16: "The net present value (NPV) of adaptation investments, specifically the difference\
    \ between adapting early versus adapting later (\u0394NPV)."
  20: Agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate risks, and structural shifts into
    industry and urban living may or may not improve resilience depending on whether
    those sectors and locations are subject to lower risks than agriculture.
  25: Economy-wide effects of adaptation policies at the sector level; Performance
    of adaptation measures under different climate scenarios.
