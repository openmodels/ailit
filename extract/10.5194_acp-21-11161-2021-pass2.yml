Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increase in surface temperatures leading to enhanced instability and stronger
    moisture transport; increase in total column water vapor (TCWV); convective available
    potential energy (CAPE) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) jointly controlling lightning
    frequency trends; urbanization (implicitly through GCM projections).
  11: Increased surface warming (linked to RCP8.5 scenarios) leading to increased
    CAPE and TCWV, UTLS cooling, and changes in specific humidity and ozone depletion.
    AOD increases also impact lightning occurrences.
  12: Increase in CAPE, TCWV, and aerosol effect as drivers of increased lightning
    frequency and intensity.
  13: Increased surface temperatures leading to higher instability and moisture transport;
    aerosol-cloud interactions; climate change scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5).
  14: Urbanization, GHG emissions (leading to increased precipitable water vapor and
    convective available potential energy), aerosol input
Highlights:
  1: Lightning frequency and intensity are expected to increase significantly across
    India by the end of the century, especially along the coasts, requiring immediate
    attention from policymakers.
  11: CAPE and TCWV are projected to increase under higher surface warming (RCP8.5),
    leading to stronger increases in lightning activity. Lightning occurrences show
    an overall increasing trend of 19%-31% over 150 years. The trends are more pronounced
    towards the end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario.
  12: Stronger increases in lightning frequency and radiance under RCP8.5 scenario
    due to significant rises in CAPE and TCWV.
  13: Lightning activity is projected to increase significantly across India by 2100,
    especially in coastal regions, with extreme radiance showing the most substantial
    increase under higher emission scenarios (RCP8.5). Atmospheric moisture is the
    principle factor controlling lightning extreme radiance trends, while instability
    and aerosols play a role in frequency variation.
  14: The net intensification in lightning properties by 2100 is such that extreme
    lightning radiances will increase much faster than lightning occurrences. Coastal
    regions and surrounding seas are prone to higher risk, with potential radiance
    increases of ~50% (RCP8.5).
Methodology:
  1: "Analysis of long-term (1998\u20132014) Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)\
    \ satellite-based lightning observations; statistical dominance analysis; multiple\
    \ linear regression equations employed in multiple global circulation models (GCMs)\
    \ to understand the long-term impact of urbanization on lightning over the period\
    \ from 1950 to 2100; RCP8.5 projections."
  11: The study uses eight Global Climate Models (GCMs) and analyzes trends in lightning
    properties (frequency and intensity) based on RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios over
    a 150-year period for different Indian zones. Taylor diagrams are used to evaluate
    GCM performance. The analysis considers various atmospheric parameters like TCWV,
    CAPE, AOD, temperature, specific humidity, and ozone.
  12: Multi-model projections and zonal analysis to study trends in lightning frequency
    and intensity over a 150-year period.
  13: Utilizes high-resolution lightning observations and multi-model GCM datasets
    to derive future projections of lightning properties over the Indian regions for
    the 21st century; examines interrelationships between lightning and causative
    factors (moisture, instability, aerosols).
  14: "Multilinear regression equations are developed based on observed interrelationships\
    \ between surface temperatures, moisture, instability, ozone and moisture concentrations\
    \ in the UTLS, and lightning properties. These equations are then implemented\
    \ on four GCMs from the eight available models for the 1950\u20132100 period.\
    \ The models and equations were validated against observational datasets."
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the Indian region. The study identifies TCWV as the dominant
    factor behind the intensification in lightning events.
  11: The paper focuses on the impact of climate change on lightning properties in
    the Indian region. While it doesn't explicitly mention macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes, the increased lightning activity could potentially lead to economic
    losses due to infrastructure damage, disruptions in economic activities, and impacts
    on agriculture, which would be relevant to a broader macroeconomic/fiscal assessment.
  12: Focus is on climatic parameters influencing lightning, with no direct linkage
    to economic or fiscal outcomes.
  13: The study suggests that the increased lightning poses a socioeconomic threat
    and requires immediate mitigation strategies from policymakers.
  14: The projected lightning increase is lower than some studies over the USA, potentially
    due to stronger urbanization in those regions or different methodologies. The
    study acknowledges limitations in providing an overall explanation for the whole
    Indian region, noting that secondary mechanisms from orographic influence or aerosol
    effects could play a stronger role in specific regions.

  12: Percentage increases in lightning occurrences and radiance under RCP2.6 and
    RCP8.5 scenarios are provided.
  13: Lightning frequencies show a growth of ~1%-2% annually across all Indian regions
    (1998-2014). Under RCP2.6, lightning frequency rises ~13%, and ~19% under RCP8.5.
    Extreme radiance increases ~22% under RCP2.6, and ~37% under RCP8.5. Coastal regions
    could face up to a ~50% rise in extreme lightning intensities by 2100.
