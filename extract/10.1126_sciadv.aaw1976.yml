  8: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Global climate modes such as El Ni\xF1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian\
    \ Ocean Dipole (IOD), and tropical Atlantic variability (TAV) impacting worldwide\
    \ crop yields."
  3: "Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), Tropical Atlantic Variability (TAV), North Atlantic\
    \ Oscillation (NAO), El Ni\xF1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), La Ni\xF1a, decreased\
    \ summer monsoon precipitation, climate variability, climate-related stresses\
    \ (weather- and climate mode\u2013related)."
  4: Climate modes, specifically ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation), IOD, TAV, and
    NAO.
  5: "Climate modes, specifically ENSO, IOD, TAV, and NAO, are identified as drivers\
    \ of risk. ENSO is highlighted as having a substantial influence on global production\
    \ and potential to force globally synchronous maize failures. Specific ENSO events\
    \ (El Ni\xF1o, La Ni\xF1a, transitioning events) impact crop yields in different\
    \ regions."
  6: "ENSO (El Ni\xF1o-Southern Oscillation), specifically the transition from El\
    \ Ni\xF1o to La Ni\xF1a."
  8: "Climate variability, specifically the Southern Annular Mode, the Scandinavian\
    \ pattern, the East Atlantic index, the Western Pacific index, El Ni\xF1o-Southern\
    \ Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Tropical Atlantic Variability\
    \ (TAV), and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)."
  10: Climate change
Highlights:
  1: ENSO and other climate modes can lead to synchronous global crop failures, with
    ENSO responsible for the largest synchronous crop failure in modern history in
    1983.
  3: "Climate modes contribute roughly equally (\u223C 15 to 20%) to the overall climate-related\
    \ crop yield variance. The influence of the NAO on wheat production variance at\
    \ the global scale reflects its influence in high-production systems. Teleconnections\
    \ to maize remain comparable to or stronger than teleconnections to wheat and\
    \ soybean in all quartiles of production intensity."
  4: Maize production is more strongly affected by climate modes than wheat or soybeans;
    positive and negative climate teleconnections to maize yields are minimally offsetting,
    while teleconnections to wheat and soybean yields are substantially offsetting
  5: "ENSO has a substantial influence on global crop production, particularly maize,\
    \ and has the potential to force globally synchronous maize failures, as exemplified\
    \ by the 1983 El Ni\xF1o event. The distribution of cropland across regions influences\
    \ whether climate modes force synchronous crop failures."
  6: ENSO played a major role in forcing synchronous crop failures in 1983, a year
    identified as the most extensive synchronous crop failure in the modern record.
Methodology:
  1: Maximum covariance analysis used to identify how climate modes influence global
    crop yields; results applicable for monitoring and potentially predicting simultaneous
    crop failures.
  3: Partial regression coefficients for the standardized IOD, TAV, or NAO time expansion
    coefficients on dependent climate variables. Global analysis considering all growing
    regions, separating production statistics into quartiles of production intensity.
  4: Variance analysis of harvested area in different regions, explaining percentage
    of national or subnational scale variance in wheat, soybean, and maize production
    explained by ENSO, IOD, TAV, or NAO
  5: MCA (presumably, multivariate climate analysis) is used to derive ENSO-forced
    yield anomalies. The analysis examines the impact of climate modes on crop yield
    variability at regional and global scales. The analysis considers the distribution
    of cultivated lands in relation to climate teleconnections.
  6: Analysis of national and subnational crop statistics to identify ENSO-forced
    yield anomalies, with 1983 used as a case study due to its synchronous crop failure.
    Relies on data from national agencies.
  8: The study uses Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA) to identify major coupled modes
    of climate variability and their relationship to crop yields. They also use linear
    multiple regression analyses, event composites, and correlations to confirm that
    each mode corresponds to a known mode of climate variability. Local and global
    production variance are calculated to assess the impacts.
  10: Not specified on this page, but potentially involves analyzing the causes of
    synchronous crop failures.
More Notes:
  3: The paper examines the teleconnections between climate modes and crop yields
    globally, accounting for spatial and temporal variations in these relationships.
    They find that the impact of climate modes can differ significantly across regions.
  4: Heavy irrigation of wheat in China and India explains the muted effect of climate
    modes on wheat production.
  5: The paper highlights the importance of understanding how climate teleconnections
    intersect with the distribution of cultivated lands. It suggests that further
    research is needed on how climate-related production anomalies translate to price
    shocks or export restrictions, which could have broader macroeconomic implications.
    The analysis also considers the importance of local weather, pests, disease, and
    management decisions.
  6: The study focuses on maize, wheat, and soybean, and uses data from various national
    agencies for different countries, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
    Integrated Agricultural Information System (Argentina), and Brazilian Companhia
    Nacional de Abastecimento, among others.

  4: National-scale crop production variability of wheat, maize, and soybean
  5: The paper discusses global crop (maize, soybean, and wheat) production variability
    and synchronous crop failures as outcomes. It mentions access to food and household
    welfare as potentially affected by crop failures.
  6: Crop yield anomalies and maize production anomalies.
  8: Crop production anomalies (used as a proxy for economic impact in agricultural-dependent
    national economies).
  10: Crop failures and climate-forced production variability
Quantitative material:
  1: 18% of maize, 7% of soybean, and 6% of wheat production variability globally
    attributed to climate variability modes.
  3: Climate modes account for 23, 17, and 15% of local maize, wheat, and soybean
    production variability, respectively. Climate variability accounts for ~14% of
    winter wheat production variance in Europe but ~64% in North Africa.
  4: Climate modes account for 18% of variability of global maize production but only
    7 and 6% of variability of global soybean and wheat production
  6: Observed and ENSO-forced percent crop yield anomalies in 1983, maize production
    anomalies (kg) by country, and national and subnational crop statistics from various
    countries.
  8: The paper quantifies local and global production variance to measure the impact
    of climate variability on crop yields.
