  38: Paper 75 presents the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI),
    a drought index.
Highlights:
  1: Links between greenhouse gas emissions pathways and resultant physical climate
    risks.
  4: By 2050, physical risks greatly depend on the temperature pathway. By 2030, transition
    risks are sensitive to temperature pathways. Transition risks also depend on technological,
    policy and socio-economic factors.
  6: Presents an integrated framework for physical and transition risks. Results focused
    on the world and four key regions (China, USA, EU+UK, and India) with additional
    results for other regions in extended data.
  10: Chance of major heatwaves and agricultural indicators have the most non-linear
    relationships with temperature, leading to the greatest differences between temperature
    scenarios. India is particularly vulnerable to increased river flooding and agricultural
    drought under the NDC Pledges scenario compared to the 2C Central scenario.
  11: NDC Pledges scenario leads to significantly greater heat stress and yield reductions
    for maize compared to the 2C Central scenario, with substantial impacts in Russia,
    the EU+UK, and Brazil.
  12: The NDC pathway for the EU+UK and USA is more stringent than the 2C Central
    scenario in terms of emissions reductions by 2030 in the GCAM model. Global abatement
    costs are significantly different between the 1.5C and 2C Central scenarios.
  13: Even scenarios aimed at the same temperature goal can have considerably different
    transition risks by 2030.
  14: Single-model analysis reinforces findings about inter-model diversity of results
    from the NGFS scenarios.
  15: More stringent mitigation action leads to higher abatement costs and sector-specific
    transition risks, but lower physical climate hazards. Scenarios with similar longer-term
    physical risks could have very different near-term transition risks.
  16: The framework provides a basis for analyzing the global and regional physical
    and transition consequences of different plausible emissions pathways and identifying
    underlying drivers of economic changes.

    measuring transition risks.

    the risks under the 2C Central scenario.
  33: Drought likelihood averaged over cells with cropland is around 9-10% globally.
    Likelihood of damaging temperatures during maize reproduction is around 5% globally,
    with regional variability.
  34: Explores disorderly scenarios through regional fragmentation and staged accession
    to a long-term temperature mitigation strategy.
  35: "Explores different technology pathways to achieve different warming levels,\
    \ including scenarios that miss the 2\xB0C target. Includes a specific 1.5\xB0\
    C scenario emphasizing rapid decarbonization and end-use electrification."
Methodology:
  1: The paper analyzes near-term transition and longer-term physical climate risks
    based on different greenhouse gas emissions pathways.
  4: Integrated framework to explore near term (to 2030) transition risks and longer
    term (to 2050) physical risks, globally and in specific regions, for a range of
    plausible greenhouse gas emissions.
  6: Combines a technology-rich, regionally disaggregated IAM, a reduced complexity
    climate model, and a suite of impacts models. Applicable to the 21st century.
  8: Scenarios developed based on different temperature targets (1.5oC, 2oC, 2.5oC,
    3oC, 4oC) and policy assumptions. Results applicable to the 21st century (2020-2100).
  9: 'The paper calculates regional hazard and impact attributes of seven physical
    hazard indicators, measuring: heatwave, major heatwave, hydrological drought and
    river flooding annual likelihoods; agricultural drought and maize heat stress
    annual likelihood; and change in maize crop duration. The likelihoods can be interpreted
    as acute risks, while the average annual change in crop growth duration is a chronic
    risk. Impacts are expressed as annual averages and characterize chronic risks.'
  10: Metrics are normalized by values in 2050 (physical risk) and 2030 (transition
    risk) with the 2C Central scenario, using 1981-2010 as a reference period for
    physical climate impacts.
  12: Model-specific to GCAM. Results are applicable to 2030 scenarios. Uses scenarios
    including 1.5C, 2C Central, and NDC Pledges.

    of indicators.
  14: "Broad scenario sensitivity analysis within a single model; Illustrative 1.5oC\
    \ and 2oC pathway ensembles are compared to the IPCC\u2019s SR1.5 database of\
    \ 1.5oC-consistent scenarios."
  15: The analysis compares physical and transition risks, focusing on mid-century
    but salient for present-day decisions.
  16: The analysis uses an integrated scenario analysis framework that can be built
    upon by stakeholders. It involves downscaling sector-level and economy-wide outputs
    from IAMs to firm- and household-level financial risks. The page discusses the
    importance of considering systemic risk and adaptation measures.
  17: GCAM and MAGICC models were used to generate climate scenarios. Climate impact
    models were then run based on these scenarios. Scenario data analysis and visualization
    were undertaken.
  18: The table describes different climate scenarios (No Policy, NDC Pledges, 2C,
    2.5C, 1.5C) with varying assumptions about policy implementation, socioeconomic
    pathways, and technology deployment between 2010/2021/2025/2040 and 2100.
  19: The analysis considers physical hazard indicators for 2050 and transition risk
    indicators for 2030, relative to a "No Policy" scenario.
  27: Uses GCAM version 5.1, an open-source, technology-rich model of the energy,
    economy, agriculture and land use, water, atmosphere, and climate systems. GCAM
    is a five-year time step, dynamic-recursive market equilibrium model which represents
    the global economy by disaggregating the world into 32 geopolitical regions, 235
    river basins and 384 agro-ecological land-use regions.  Calibrated to a historic
    base year (2010). Emission constraints are assumed to begin in 2025 (except for
    the NDCs, which begin in 2020). Calculates the CO2 prices required to meet the
    emissions constraint imposed in each model period.
  28: The Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) version 5.1 tracks emissions of 24
    GHGs, aerosols, and short-lived species endogenously based on energy, agriculture,
    and land systems activity. Emissions can then be passed to the climate carbon-cycle
    module and converted to concentrations, radiative forcing, temperature, and other
    responses to the climate system, although in this study, a separate climate module
    and impacts models are used for these subsequent steps.
  29: Draws from IAM-based indicators of feasibility of the transition, uses diagnostic
    exercises to compare major IAM characteristics. IAMs are used to produce outputs,
    including a relative abatement index (measuring the share of baseline emissions
    reduced in a policy case); an emissions reduction type index (showing the share
    of the relative abatement index that can be attributed to supply side measures);
    marginal abatement cost curves showing emissions reductions against carbon prices;
    energy intensity and carbon intensity; measures of fuel shares of major primary
    fuels such as fossil and non-fossil sources; mitigation costs; and the mitigation
    cost achieved per unit of carbon pricing.
  30: The study uses temperature outputs from GCAM 5.1 and runs them through a probabilistic
    variant of MAGICC4.2 to include uncertainties. The MAGICC4.2 model is described
    as an upwelling-diffusion ocean coupled to an atmosphere layer and a globally
    averaged carbon cycle model. Uncertainty in temperature response is sampled by
    perturbing equilibrium climate sensitivity, the ocean mixing rate, and a measure
    of climate-carbon cycle feedback strength.
  31: Spatially-explicit global-scale impacts models are used to calculate seven indicators
    of hazard and related impact across different sectors for each emissions scenario
    over a 30-year period. Damage functions relate the indicators to increases in
    global mean surface temperature, calculated from CMIP5 climate models. These are
    combined with probability distributions of temperature change for a given emissions
    scenario to produce distributions of hazard and impact indicator in each year.
    Damage functions are constructed separately for five SSP socio-economic scenarios
    and at 10-year increments.
  33: Calculates drought likelihood and impact based on SPEI and population/cropland
    area. Crop yield changes are estimated based on changes in growing degree-day
    accumulation. Maize cropland area is assumed constant over time.
  34: Explore variations around underlying socio-economic trends including SSP1 and
    SSP3.
  35: "Uses GCAM modeling team to explore technology variations in transition pathways\
    \ to different warming levels (2\xB0C, ~2.5\xB0C, 1.5\xB0C). A specific 1.5\xB0\
    C scenario was developed by ClimateWorks Foundation in partnership with the Pacific\
    \ Northwest National Laboratory GCAM modelling team."
