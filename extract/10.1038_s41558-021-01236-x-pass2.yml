Drivers of Risk:
  4: Greenhouse gas emissions pathways, temperature pathways (1.5-4oC warming), technological
    factors, policy factors, socio-economic factors
  6: Physical risks stemming from temperature changes; Transition risks from scenarios
    spanning 1.5-4oC temperatures; Underlying socio-economics; Technological options;
    Timing of mitigation action; Policy implementation in different world regions.
  10: Changes in likelihood of acute events (heatwave, river flooding, agricultural
    drought); Temperature increases
  12: Stringency of emissions reductions pathways (1.5C, 2C, NDC Pledges) and the
    associated transition risks.
  15: Carbon prices, potential stranding of carbon-intensive assets, demand reductions
    for fossil fuels and technologies, changes to electricity and food prices, economy-wide
    abatement costs, physical climate hazards.
  19: Physical hazards such as heatwaves, river floods, hydrological and agricultural
    droughts; transition risks like abatement costs, carbon pricing, reduction in
    fossil fuel demand, and electricity prices.
  29: Potential for stranding of coal plant capacity; Carbon price levels impacting
    energy portfolio default likelihoods; Abatement costs; Electricity and food prices.
  30: High-level dynamics of the transition (presumably to a low-carbon economy)
  31: Exposure to drought, river flooding, heatwaves, and reductions in potential
    crop yield.
  32: 'Heatwaves (two indicators: at least two days exceeding the 95th percentile,
    and at least four days exceeding the 99th percentile), river flood risk (frequency
    of the reference period 50-year flood), and water resources drought risk (Standardised
    Runoff Index (SRI) less than -1.5 for at least six months).'
  35: The pace and type of climate mitigation policies and technological advancements
    drive different warming scenarios.

Highlights:
  4: Physical risks (heatwaves, agricultural drought, heat stress, crop duration reductions)
    by 2050 depend greatly on the temperature pathway.
  6: Presents a fully integrated framework for self-consistent analysis of physical
    and transition risks, complementing and expanding on NGFS scenarios. Focuses on
    world, China, USA, EU+UK, and India. Includes additional results for Brazil, Japan,
    Middle East, Russia and Sub-Saharan Africa in Extended Data and Supplementary
    Information.
  10: The chance of experiencing a major heatwave and agricultural indicators have
    the most highly non-linear relationships with temperature, showing the greatest
    difference between the temperature scenarios; India faces disproportionately higher
    increases in river flooding and agricultural drought frequency under the NDC Pledges
    scenario compared to the 2C Central scenario.
  12: The stringency of the transition pathway, and thus the degree of transition
    risk, is not necessarily set for a given temperature pathway in each region, as
    illustrated by the differences between the 2C Central and NDC Pledges scenarios
    for the EU+UK and USA.
  15: More stringent mitigation action leads to higher abatement costs and sector-specific
    transition risks, but lower physical climate hazards; scenarios with similar longer-term
    physical risks could have very different near-term transition risks.
  29: Abatement costs directly impact economic output; Carbon price levels are central
    to considerations of energy portfolio default likelihoods.
  31: Physical risks are characterized by the median ratio between the scenario risks
    and the risks under the 2C Central scenario.

Methodology:
  4: Integrated framework to explore near term (to 2030) transition risks and longer
    term (to 2050) physical risks, globally and in specific regions
  6: Combines a technology-rich, regionally disaggregated IAM, a reduced complexity
    climate model, and a suite of impacts models. The IAM represents energy system,
    agricultural and land-based greenhouse gas emissions. Scenarios explore a range
    of temperature outcomes and socio-economic/technological choices for 2oC target
    pathways.
  10: The framework identifies physical and transition risk metrics that vary most
    between temperature scenarios; metrics are normalised by values in 2050 (physical
    risk) and 2030 (transition risk) with the 2C Central scenario; Physical risk metrics
    show the change in likelihood of the specified acute event relative to the change
    with the 2C Central scenario, except for crop growth duration which shows the
    change in yield relative to the change with the 2C Central scenario; The ratio
    of temperature increase above the 1981-2010 period is used as a reference for
    physical climate impacts.
  12: Analysis is performed using the GCAM model to compare different climate scenarios
    (1.5C, 2C, NDC Pledges) and their associated abatement costs. Results are applicable
    to 2030.
  15: Analysis compares physical and transition risks; physical risk analysis focuses
    on mid-century.
  27: Land-use change emissions are priced as an exogenously specified proportion
    of the fossil emissions price, representing limitations in land-use policy implementation.
  29: Draws from IAM-based indicators of feasibility of the transition which emphasise
    the importance of abatement costs and carbon prices, as well as reaffirming the
    importance of coal plant idling and capacity reductions; uses diagnostic exercises
    to compare major IAM characteristics, including a relative abatement index, emissions
    reduction type index, marginal abatement cost curves, energy and carbon intensity,
    fuel shares, mitigation costs, and mitigation cost per unit of carbon pricing.
  30: Uses GCAM version 5.1 temperature outputs and a probabilistic variant of the
    MAGICC4.2 simple climate model to simulate climate scenarios. Uncertainty is introduced
    by perturbing equilibrium climate sensitivity, ocean mixing rate, and climate-carbon
    cycle feedback strength. Parameter distributions are based on climate modeling
    literature (CMIP5 and C4MIP).
  31: Spatially-explicit global-scale impacts models are used to calculate seven hazard
    and related impact indicators for each emissions scenario, based on damage functions
    relating the indicator to the increase in global mean surface temperature. Damage
    functions are constructed for five SSP socio-economic scenarios at 10-year increments
    and combined with the probability distributions of change in temperature to produce
    distributions of hazard and impact indicators in each year.
  32: Uses climate models at a 0.5x0.5 degree scale with daily time steps, applying
    climate scenarios to observed climate time series from 1981-2010 to define the
    current reference climate; scaled climate scenarios are constructed using pattern-scaling.
    Damage functions are assumed to be equally plausible.
  35: "The study uses different transition pathways based on varying levels of climate\
    \ mitigation, including those achieving below 2\xB0C, around 2.5\xB0C, and 1.5\xB0\
    C warming. These scenarios consider technology variations (high renewables vs.\
    \ non-renewables) and assumptions around industrial demand, building efficiency,\
    \ transport behavior, land use, and agricultural practices."

More Notes:
  4: Transition risks also depend on technological, policy and socio-economic factors,
    especially when considering pathways towards a 2oC target.
  6: Supplementary figures show temporal evolution of transition and physical risk
    indicators. Methods section fully describes modelling approach, indicator choices,
    and scenario choices. The study uses 11 scenarios.
  10: The paper implicitly assumes that the significance of the change in metric is
    directly proportional to the change, and that a normalised indicator of 1.5 is
    50% worse than the 2C Central scenario.
  12: Abatement cost alone may not capture all macroeconomic consequences, particularly
    if it stimulates net investment, innovation, and growth. Further macro-modelling
    analysis is required to substantiate this, considering resource utilization in
    the region.
  15: The analysis serves as a framework for comparing physical and transition risks
    and can be built upon to encompass a wider range of scenarios and metrics.
  29: The analysis does *not* consider the potential stimulus effect of low-carbon
    investment on economic growth.
  30: The analysis focuses on transition risks and does not convert metrics into value-at-risk
    or value losses.
  31: Uncertainty in ocean mixing is based on model results from the IPCC fourth assessment.
  32: The paper models the average annual number of people exposed to heatwaves and
    flooding, which are related to productivity and economic outcomes, but the exact
    relationship or magnitude of macroeconomic outcomes is not quantified here.
  35: The study uses the GCAM model, and the data is available upon request and publicly
