Drivers of Risk:
  1: Monsoon rainfall shocks, particularly droughts, affecting agricultural yield.
  2: Variation in monsoon rainfall (positive and negative shocks) is the main driver
    of economic uncertainty in rural India.
  3: Negative monsoon rainfall shocks (regional and local droughts).
  5: Summer monsoon rainfall variations at the district level.
  8: Variations in monsoon rainfall in India
  9: Variations in overall monsoon rainfall (measured in district standard deviations).
  10: Overall rainfall variation (monsoon rainfall shocks) and its spatial distribution
    (regional vs. local).
  11: Monsoon rainfall shocks in India, with monthly variations impacting annual crop
    yields.
  12: Negative rainfall shocks (droughts) of below -1.5 district standard deviation.
  13: Monsoon rainfall shocks (negative).
  14: Rainfall variations (local and regional), both positive and negative, and their
    interaction with irrigation share.
  15: Monsoon rainfall shocks, both negative and positive, at local and regional levels
    with varying irrigation.
  16: Negative local rainfall shock (below mean overall standardized rainfall)
  17: Negative rainfall shock (decrease in overall standardized kharif rainfall)
  18: Negative regional rainfall shock.
  19: Negative local/regional rainfall shocks.
  20: Local rainfall shocks; Regional rainfall shocks
  21: Monsoon rainfall shocks (local and regional)
  22: Positive regional rainfall shock in the Kharif season (summer).
  24: Negative regional rainfall shocks and the impact of relief programs on agriculture.
  25: Negative monsoon rainfall shocks (local and regional).
  26: Negative local/regional rainfall shocks.
  27: Positive local/regional rainfall shocks based on administrative divisions
  29: Negative regional rainfall shocks (monsoon rainfall shocks).
  30: Local and regional rainfall shocks lead to changes in purchasing power for agricultural
    laborers and cultivators.
  31: Negative regional rainfall shocks (monsoon rainfall shocks).
  32: Negative regional rainfall shocks (drought).
  33: Monsoon rainfall shocks (both positive and negative).
  34: The variation of monsoon rainfall due to climate change impacts economic activities.
Highlights:
  1: Monsoon droughts result in yield losses, leading to a persistent decline in wages
    and an increase in food prices lasting up to five years.
  2: The paper distinguishes between positive and negative monsoon rainfall shocks
    to account for their asymmetric effects, and controls for the spatial dimension
    of rainfall shocks to study the potentially moderating effects of arbitrage trading
    and migration on food prices and wages.
  3: Monsoon rainfall shocks have asymmetric effects on agricultural yield, with negative
    shocks having a much larger impact than positive shocks. Regional droughts lead
    to persistent declines in wages and increases in food prices, with distributional
    consequences particularly harmful to the rural poor.
  8: Negative deviations in standardized rainfall have a substantial negative impact
    on agricultural yield, whereas rainfall above the average has a much smaller positive
    impact. The relationship between rainfall and agricultural yield is non-linear.
  9: There is a non-linear relationship between monsoon rainfall and agricultural
    yield. Agricultural yield increases with monsoon rainfall up to a point, after
    which it declines.
  10: The impact of rainfall variation on agricultural yield varies at different levels
    of irrigation. Regional rainfall shocks tend to arrive in the months most crucial
    for crop yield.
  11: Annual agricultural yield is more sensitive to rainfall variations in June,
    September, and October; rainfall shocks have varying effects on agricultural yield
    based on timing and whether the shock is positive or negative.
  12: A severe negative rainfall shock leads to a sharp decline in rice yield. Rice
    yield returns quickly back to its pre-shock level in the year after the shock.
    Initially, nominal agricultural wages do not appear to be affected.
  13: Negative monsoon rainfall shocks have lasting impacts on income and food prices.
    Agricultural wages are stagnant in the year after the shock and do not recover
    to pre-shock trends within four years. Rice prices increase and remain elevated
    for over two years.
  14: The non-linear specification captures the different effects of rainfall variations,
    while accounting for local irrigation share and monsoon season temperature as
    a control variable.
  16: Negative local rainfall shocks on Kharif yield are mitigated by irrigation.
    Decline in monsoon rainfall leads to a lagged, but persistent decline in the agricultural
    wage.
  17: Illustrates the impulse responses to a one-unit decrease in overall standardized
    kharif rainfall caused by a purely local/regional rainfall shock, when overall
    standardized kharif rainfall is below its mean.
  18: Regional rainfall shocks have a substantially larger effect on agricultural
    yield (particularly at low levels of irrigation) compared to local rainfall shocks.
    Stronger response in agricultural yield translates to a roughly proportionally
    stronger response in agricultural wages.
  19: Negative rainfall shocks at low irrigation lead to significant reductions in
    agricultural yield; Local Shock -0.148*** (Baseline), -0.164*** (Small districts),
    -0.119** (Large districts); Regional Shock -0.317*** (Baseline), -0.235*** (Small
    districts), -0.272*** (Large districts).
  20: Intra-regional arbitrage trading reduces exposure to food price fluctuations
    due to local circumstances; Supra-regional agricultural trade networks in India
    are still incomplete; Positive local rainfall shocks have no significant effects
    on agricultural yield, wages or food prices; Positive regional rainfall shocks
    lead to an initial decline in agricultural yield, followed by recovery and then
    another decline before returning to normal; Effects of local rainfall variations
    are strongly asymmetric; Positive shocks cannot counterbalance the adverse effects
    caused by negative shocks.
  21: The paper analyzes the dynamic effects of monsoon rainfall shocks on wages and
    prices in India, distinguishing between local and regional rainfall variations.
    Effects are presented for different levels of irrigation.
  22: A positive rainfall shock in the Kharif season leads to an initial increase
    in Kharif yields, followed by a decline in the following year, potentially due
    to increased Rabi crop production. Rabi crop yield increases and Rabi crop prices
    decrease in response to a positive Kharif rainfall shock.
  24: "State\u2013year fixed effects help isolate impacts of state-level interventions\
    \ and rainfall shocks."
  25: Internal migration across NSS regions can dampen the decline in local agricultural
    wages in response to purely local negative rainfall shocks, but is less effective
    in mitigating adverse effects of rainfall shocks affecting the entire NSS region.
    State borders are relatively more important for migration than distance, while
    distance is relatively more important for trade in food products.
  26: The impact of negative local/regional rainfall shocks based on administrative
    divisions is analyzed.
  27: Presents the impact of positive local/regional rainfall shocks on wages and
    prices in India for different levels of irrigation.
  29: Negative rainfall shocks lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of agricultural
    laborers due to rising food prices outweighing the relative stability of nominal
    wages (due to downward nominal wage rigidities).
  30: Local and regional rainfall shocks negatively impact purchasing power, with
    more significant losses among cultivators compared to agricultural laborers over
    a six-year horizon.
  31: Negative rainfall shocks lead to reduced labor demand and wages for agricultural
    laborers, impacting their purchasing power. Cultivators may benefit from reduced
    wages if they hire additional workers. Both agricultural laborers and cultivators
    reduce consumption of staple foods after rainfall shocks.
  32: Drought impacts consumption patterns differently for agricultural labourers
    and cultivators; cultivators have more scope to smooth consumption of staple foods.
    Agricultural labourers' staple food expenditures remain below normal for several
    years after a drought, suggesting credit constraints.
  33: Effects of monsoon rainfall shocks on agricultural yield in India are highly
    asymmetric, with negative shocks having a much larger impact than positive shocks;
    short-lived yield loss after a regional drought elicits a persistent decline in
    wages and a persistent increase in food prices; regional droughts have important
    distributional consequences, particularly affecting agricultural laborers and
    the rural poor.
  34: An increase in the variation of monsoon rainfall due to climate change is likely
    to exert adverse effects on internal mobility and agricultural productivity.

    shocks on agricultural outcomes in India.
  2: "The paper uses a dynamic framework, specifically a panel vector autoregression\
    \ (VAR) based on data from 310 Indian districts over the period 1967\u20132005,\
    \ to capture the persistent effects of monsoon rainfall shocks."
  3: Empirical analysis of the effects of monsoon rainfall shocks on wages and prices
    in India, considering the role of irrigation. Applicable to understanding the

    instead of a 200 km distance-based measure. Analysis is based on NSS regions
  29: Partial equilibrium analysis based on impulse responses, assumes fixed share
    of income spent on food, constant expenditures on other goods, no unemployment
    among agricultural laborers, and cultivators exclusively rely on their own labor.

    Sample Survey Organisation, 2012a,b) with NSS region rainfall shocks to estimate
    the endogenous response in consumption expenditures.

  33: Dynamic approach examining the effects of monsoon rainfall shocks on agricultural
    yield, wages, and food prices in India, distinguishing between positive and negative
    rainfall shocks and explicitly considering their spatial dimension (local/regional).
More Notes:
  3: The extent of irrigation dampens the fall in agricultural wages after a regional
    drought, but not the rise in food prices. Regional droughts have more significant
    impacts than local droughts because they tend to occur during critical crop-growing
    months. Internal migration is determined by affiliation to the same NSS region,
    while distance is more relevant for food arbitrage trading. Downward nominal wage
    rigidity protects agricultural laborers from nominal wage cuts in the short run,
    but their real income deteriorates in the medium run due to declining wages and
    rising food prices.
  9: The study controls for interaction effects between rainfall and irrigation. The
    non-linear relationship between rainfall and agricultural yield is very strong
    at low levels of irrigation but becomes weaker at higher levels of irrigation.
  10: The paper finds that regional rainfall shocks are not randomly distributed across
    the monsoon season. The paper also considers how arbitrage trading and migration
    can mitigate the adverse effects of rainfall shocks on food prices and wages.
  13: The study uses panel unit-root tests to ensure the validity of the endogenous
    variables. Irrigation share is included in first-differences because one unit-root
    test did not suggest stationarity.
  16: The study examines the effects of rainfall shocks, irrigation, and wages in
    India. Standard errors are clustered at the district level. The authors investigate
    the time stability of the results by splitting the sample into two subsamples
    (1967-1991 and 1981-2005) and they investigate whether the shocks had different
    effects in different parts of India based on when the monsoon arrives.
  17: The analysis focuses on kharif rainfall; results are presented for different
    levels of irrigation, suggesting irrigation is a relevant moderating factor.
  18: Regional rainfall shocks tend to arrive in the months most crucial for crop
    yield. The effects on agricultural yield are short-lived, disappearing within
    a year.
  19: The impact of rainfall shocks on agricultural yield decreases with increased
    irrigation levels. The dependent variable is the same-year response of agricultural
    yield.
  22: Results for Rabi crops are based on limited data and should be considered illustrative.
    The negative response of Kharif yield in Figure 9 is insignificant and does not
    establish a major concern.
  26: The regional shock is based on NSS regions (as defined in the 44th round, 1988)
    instead of a 200 km distance-based measure.
  27: Figure 12 displays results based on administrative divisions.
  29: The analysis focuses on the effects at the median level of irrigation.
  31: The partial equilibrium exercise likely underestimates the adverse impact on
    the purchasing power of agricultural laborers and overestimates the impact on
    cultivators. The analysis focuses on cultivators who own or control less than
    3 ha of land.
  33: Irrigation dampens the fall in agricultural wages after a regional drought,
    but not the rise in food prices; distance seems to be the key determinant of food
    arbitrage trading.
  34: To mitigate adverse effects, investments in infrastructure and reduction of
    legislative barriers are recommended.

Quantitative material:
  3: Yield falls by up to 30 percent (15 percent) after a regional (local) drought;
    Wages fall by up to 7 percent, with the peak decline occurring two years after
    the drought and lasting up to five years; Food prices immediately rise by up to
    5 percent, and remain at elevated levels for up to two years.
  5: Uses standardized summer monsoon rainfall calculated as (monsoon rainfall - mean
    monsoon rainfall)/standard deviation of monsoon rainfall.
  8: Positive/negative variations of more than one standard deviation occur in about
    16 percent of years, while the relative frequency of deviations of more than two
    standard deviations is roughly 2.3 percent. The LOWESS curve indicates that negative
    deviations in standardized rainfall reduce agricultural yield substantially, while
    rainfall above the district-mean reduces agricultural yield only slightly.
  9: Figure 4 shows that agricultural yield peaks near the center of the x-axis and
    tapers off towards the edges, where the x-axis represents monsoon rainfall in
    district standard deviations ranging approximately from -2.5 to 2.5, and the y-axis
    represents log agricultural yield in tons per square kilometer ranging from 4.2
    to 5.0.
  10: Figure 5 depicts the relationship between monsoon rainfall (in district standard
    deviations) and log agricultural yield at different irrigation percentiles. The
    x-axis ranges approximately from -1.5 to 1.5 standard deviations, and the y-axis
    ranges from 4.0 to 4.8 for log agricultural yield.

    impact on Kharif yield at the 25th percentile of irrigation, about -12 percent
    at the median level of irrigation, and about -7 percent at the 75th percentile
    of irrigation. The maximum impact on agricultural wage of almost -4 percent occurs

  26: The results are based on 2,952 observations at the selected lag-length; 90 percent
    confidence interval is represented.
  27: The gray area represents the 90 percent confidence interval based on standard
    errors clustered at the district level over a horizon of five years. The effects

    negative rainfall shock and remains at this level for the next five years.
  30: Effects of 1 standard deviation (SD) local and regional rainfall shocks on welfare
    of agricultural laborers and cultivators at different irrigation levels show specific
    percentage changes.
