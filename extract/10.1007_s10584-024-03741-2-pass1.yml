Drivers of Risk:
  1: Losses and damages from climate change; frequency of extreme events.
  5: Climate change
  7: Climate change effects on land or ocean resources; Sea level change, ocean warming
    and acidification, weather extremes (storms, cyclones) and sea ice loss; Water-related
    hazards (floods and droughts) and water quality deterioration; Extreme events
    leading to the breakdown of physical infrastructure and networks
  11: Hazards and exposure to disasters; pre-existing vulnerabilities; lack of infrastructural
    coping capacity; lack of institutional coping capacity; magnitude and severity
    of needs arising from disasters; time horizon (short vs. long term).
  13: Risks to water security, food security, human health, peace and human mobility,
    living standards, critical physical infrastructure, low-lying coastal socioecological
    systems, and terrestrial and ocean ecosystems.
  15: Climate change-attributable extreme events; the increased difficulty of adapting
    to climate extremes and general higher variability in climate that is projected
    to occur in the future.
Highlights:
  1: Near-future preference for magnitude-indicating criteria (people-centric and
    disaster risk-based) outweighs governance, rule of law, or socio-economic indicators.
    Financing adaptation options for climate change-related risks to food security,
    human health, and water security are a high near-future priority for minimizing
    losses and damages.
  4: The panel assigned priorities on funding criteria from the INFORM decision-making
    indices and risk options from IPCC AR6.
  11: People-centered criteria are predominantly the top criteria. The interplay between
    people-centered criteria, risk, and vulnerability is crucial for effective humanitarian
    and adaptation efforts. The importance of risk assessment increases with longer
    time horizons.  Consideration of vulnerabilities, coping capacity and potential
    impact is crucial.
  13: Risks to water security, food security, and human health were consistently rated
    as the highest priorities for funding allocation. There is tension between prioritizing
    immediate needs and addressing underlying, cascading risks like ecosystem degradation.
  14: High consensus achieved among panel members regarding priority areas for adaptation,
    with low standard deviations indicating agreement on high priorities; some areas
    of contention with higher SD in lower priority categories.
  15: Experts prioritize people in need-centric and disaster risk-based criteria over
    governance, rule of law, or socio-economic aspects in humanitarian aid and disaster
    management.
Methodology:
  1: A two-round anonymous Delphi method was used to survey the stated preferences
    of losses and damages experts (N=36) from international organizations, research
    sector, public sector, and civil society, using global frameworks for a funding
    allocation simulation. Consensus was analyzed with parametric measures.
  4: The analysis is performed using the Delphi method with a relaxed basis of stated
    preference during a funding allocation simulation.
  5: The study uses the Delphi method, employing an expert panel and iterative online
    surveys to find prioritised stated preferences relating to funding humanitarian
    or disaster aid in a future world under climate change.
  7: The study uses a panel to prioritize risks on a 4-point scale. The panel was
    provided with an analysis of the first round of prioritization to inform their
    further deliberation. Minor amendments to question titles and descriptions, merging
    of equivalent question items, and the formation of one new criterion were made
    based on panelist feedback.
  11: The paper uses expert elicitation (panel assessments) to prioritize criteria
    for humanitarian aid and adaptation. The panel was asked to justify assessments,
    measure confidence, and suggest amendments to a survey. Analysis is based on the
    coding of answers from the survey.
  13: Expert elicitation via a panel, with quantitative ratings and free-text comments.
    The results seem most applicable to short-term humanitarian aid allocation, with
    recognition that longer-term priorities may differ.
  14: The analysis is performed using a Delphi panel method to assess consensus among
    experts on priority areas for climate change adaptation.

    and disaster risk management funding allocations; Funding simulations.
More Notes:
  1: The paper explores preferences of experts on allocating public funding in humanitarian
    aid and disaster management to counter climate change impacts.
  4: The paper investigates the tension between expected utility theory (EUT) and
    empirical behavior, highlighting limitations due to bounded rationality.
  5: The study aims to identify priority criteria and options for allocating humanitarian
    or disaster aid funding regarding adaptation to key climate change risks.
  7: The study aims to explore forward-looking criteria and options that are priorities
    in humanitarian or disaster aid funding regardless of organization, policy background/job
    function, region of focus, or discrete time horizon.
  11: The study acknowledges the complex interplay between different criteria. It
    highlights the importance of considering both immediate needs and future risks
    when prioritizing adaptation measures. The sequence of potential interventions
    impacts prioritization.
  13: The panel's prioritization is influenced by the perceived feasibility of interventions
    and their potential impact in the short to medium term. Some panellists found
    it difficult to differentiate priorities, viewing all categories as important.
  15: The paper explores forward-looking criteria and options prioritized in humanitarian
    aid and disaster risk management funding allocations regardless of various factors.
    It also raises questions about the balance between responding to crises and preventing
    them in the context of scarce resources and rising extreme events.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Burden on global budgetary constraints and adaptive capacities due to climate
    change losses and damages and increased frequency of extreme events.
  7: Economic impacts across scales, including impacts on GDP, poverty and livelihoods,
    as well as the exacerbating effects of impacts on socio-economic inequality between
    and within countries
  11: This paper does not directly quantify macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes of climate
    change. However, it discusses the prioritization of humanitarian aid and adaptation
    measures based on needs assessment, risk, and vulnerability, which are indirectly
    related to economic and social well-being.

Quantitative material:
  11: Table 5 provides mean, standard deviation, median, range, and mode for various
    criteria related to humanitarian need and disaster risk assessment, but there
    is no quantification of direct macroeconomic or fiscal costs/benefits.
  13: The table contains mean, standard deviation, median, range, and mode of panellists'
    ratings of risk to various sectors, based on a scale where higher numbers indicate
    higher priority.
