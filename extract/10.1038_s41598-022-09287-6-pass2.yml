Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increase in the number of annual global tropical cyclone (TC) landfalls with
    major landfall intensity; Increasing lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) of global
    major landfalling TCs
  2: Increased frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones (TCs), specifically major
    landfall events.
  4: Increases in Lifetime Maximum Intensity (LMI) of tropical cyclones and the inherent
    large variability of the decay of intensity to landfall.
Highlights:
  1: The annual global number of landfalls has increased significantly from 1982 to
    2020.
  2: There is a statistically significant (p < 0.05) global increase in both TC and
    landfall frequency, as measured by doubling times of 47 and 46 years, respectively.
    The TC LMI has increased globally by +0.8 m/s per decade (p < 0.05).
  4: "Significant global changes in the number of tropical cyclones making landfall\
    \ as major storms are observed for the period 1982\u20132020, based on intensity\
    \ at landfall."
Methodology:
  1: "Analysis of global TC landfall changes focusing on major landfall count and\
    \ intensity change of major TCs from 1982 to 2020, using regression models; Terms\
    \ are defined such that 'landfall' refers to major landfall events with LIs of\
    \ at least major intensity (LI\u226550 m s\u22121) and 'TC' refers to landfalling\
    \ cyclones with LMIs of at least major intensity (LMI \u2265 50 m s\u22121)"
  2: Poisson regression is used to estimate the doubling time of landfall and TC counts.
    Linear trends are calculated for annual mean TC LMI (landfall maximum intensity)
    and LI (landfall intensity).
  4: Analysis of best-track data from the International Best Track Archive for Climate
    Stewardship (IBTrACS) and Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and National Hurricane
    Center (NHC) to identify trends in tropical cyclone landfalls and intensity; synthetic
    simulations are used to understand trends as a reflection of increases in LMI
    and variability in decay to landfall.
More Notes:
  1: "The lack of a significant Landfall Intensity (LI) trend is caused by the much\
    \ larger variance of LI than that of LMI in all basins, explaining the recent\
    \ emergence of a significant count change of TCs with major intensity at landfall;\
    \ About 45% of TCs maintain the major intensity to land, and this fraction has\
    \ not changed significantly (p = 0.52) for 1982\u20132020; Significant long-term\
    \ changes can still be detected for intensity thresholds above 50 m s\u22121 with\
    \ Poisson and linear regressions"
  2: "The analysis considers storm activities within 40\xB0 N/S but also notes count\
    \ increases of annual landfalls beyond 40\xB0 N/S."
  4: The study emphasizes the importance of landfall intensity (LI) for socio-economic
    impacts, as opposed to lifetime maximum intensity (LMI), which is often located
    far from coastlines. The detection of LI trends is challenging due to its larger
    variability compared to LMI.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: "The long-term TC socio-economic impact is ultimately driven by the number of\
    \ intense storms making landfall; Major TCs at landfall (LI \u2265 50 m s\u2212\
    1) are of particular interest as they account for most of the TC-related damage."
  2: No relevant information
  4: Socio-economic threat due to significant changes in the number of tropical cyclones
    making landfall as major storms.
Quantitative material:
  1: "The number of annual global tropical cyclone (TC) landfalls with major landfall\
    \ intensity (LI \u2265 50 m s\u22121) has nearly doubled from 1982 to 2020; The\
    \ lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) of global major landfalling TCs has been increasing\
    \ by 0.8 m s\u22121 per decade (p < 0.05); Doubling time of 46 years (p < 0.05)\
    \ for the global number of landfalls; Doubling time of 47 years (p < 0.05) for\
    \ the global number of TCs; Doubling of 56 years in the West Pacific (WPAC)"
  2: "TC LI \u03C3 (m s-1): West Pacific 30, East Pacific 29, North Atlantic 33, North\
    \ Indian Ocean 22, South Indian Ocean 32, South Pacific 30."
  4: Analysis of TC intensity statistics and simulations from 1982-2020, focusing
    on landfall intensity (LI) and lifetime maximum intensity (LMI); LMI location
    is, on average, more than 700 km away from the coastline; the graphs have quantified
    trend values but are not specific to macroeconomic outcomes.
