  9: This page focuses on food security, malnutrition, and agricultural production
    challenges, particularly in developing countries. It emphasizes the importance
    of accurate dietary data, sustainable intensification of agriculture, and considering
    food production in the broader context of resource competition and climate change.
    It also highlights the need for research in natural and social sciences related
    to food systems. The paper does not address specific macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    risks or the costs and benefits of adaptation at a national level, focusing instead
    on the food system.
