Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change in the Arctic region.
  3: Permafrost thawing leading to infrastructural damage and impacts from global
    energy transition.
  6: Permafrost melting due to increasing air temperature and thawing depth; natural
    emissions from melting permafrost; uncertainties in the scale of natural emissions
    and climate sensitivity.
  7: Permafrost thawing due to climate change and rising temperatures.
  8: No relevant information
  9: Permafrost degradation and shortening of the cold season.
  13: Intensive climate change in the Arctic; Accumulation of climate-related risks;
    Permafrost melting, reduction of ice cover in the Arctic Ocean, coastal erosion,
    temperature, and precipitation changes.
  14: Climate change impacts vary significantly across Russian Arctic territories,
    requiring region-specific adaptation policies. Impact zones due to local environmental
    pollution (Norilsk, Western Siberia, Arkhangelsk region). Transitional risks related
    to global low-carbon transition.
  16: No relevant information
  17: Climate change, permafrost degradation, ecological and climatic risks.
Highlights:
  1: Russian Arctic policies, while rhetorically aiming at resilient and sustainable
    growth, remain underdeveloped in accounting for multiple climate-related risks;
    a comprehensive framework of Arctic policy measures should be centered around
    climate change as a core factor.
  3: The paper aims to systematize available estimates on climate change impact on
    economic development of the Russian North and identify key areas of state policy.
  6: Permafrost melting is one of the most significant impacts of climate change in
    Russia and is often ignored by IAMs, leading to an overestimation of potential
    benefits from warming; ignoring permafrost melting leads to non-robust estimates
    of climate change-induced damage.
  7: Permafrost thawing poses a systemic macroeconomic risk to large parts of the
    Russian economy, potentially affecting infrastructure, residential areas, and
    industrial facilities.
  8: No relevant information
  9: Permafrost thaw threatens Arctic infrastructure, transport, and human health,
    potentially causing significant economic losses.
  13: Adaptation to climate change is not less important than mitigation in Russia;
    A comprehensive framework of Russian Arctic policy measures centered around climate
    change is yet to be developed.
  16: No relevant information
  17: Climate change and permafrost degradation pose risks to the economic growth
    and development of the Russian Arctic, including potential damage to infrastructure
    and specific sectors.
Methodology:
  1: Review of key policy documents issued in Russia and ongoing and planned development
    programs.
  6: The paper critiques integrated assessment models (IAMs) such as the RICE model
    and models used in the Stern Review and by Roson and Sartori for their insufficient
    treatment of permafrost melting and local Arctic climate change implications;
    claims that these models overstate the potential benefits of warming to Russia.

  13: Expansion of data collection networks; strengthening the satellite group and
    enhancing geospatial data-based techniques; Comprehensive modelling assessment
    of the economic impacts of climate change in Russia.
  14: Focus is on policy recommendations and strategic considerations for adaptation,
    with emphasis on local knowledge and regional centers of competence.
  16: No relevant information
  17: Economic assessment of the impacts of climate change; analysis of climate change
    impacts on specific sectors and infrastructure.
More Notes:
  1: 'The paper suggests two main policy dimensions: (a) strengthening the knowledge
    base on climate change, the adjunct risks, and emerging opportunities and (b)
    developing the system for climate change risk management and resilience building.'
  6: "Permafrost covers up to 2/3 of Russia\u2019s territory and a significant part\
    \ of the economically used territory in 9 regions; policy action, investment and\
    \ technology solutions are needed to take advantage of climatic changes while\
    \ mitigating the negative consequences in the Russian Arctic."
  7: The page focuses on the impact of permafrost thawing in Russia.
  8: This page focuses on summarizing the results of other papers and attributing
    them to the original sources. The only statement made by this paper is that additional
    financial resources are needed to guarantee uninterrupted consistent functioning
    of infrastructure units, which could cost 1% of GRP for Western Siberia.
  13: International cooperation is important for accumulating knowledge on climate
    change in the Arctic region but is currently hindered by the suspension of collaboration
    within key Arctic institutions.
  16: No relevant information
  17: Many sources are in Russian; the focus is primarily on the Russian Arctic region.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Minimizing net costs of climate change; resilient and sustainable growth.
  3: Lack of comprehensive understanding of climate change impacts may hinder effective
    Arctic policy implementation in Russia.
  6: Climate change-induced damage to the Russian economy; economic challenges from
    permafrost melting; potential benefits from climate change (e.g., tourism, agriculture,
    lower heating requirements).
  7: Long-term economic damage due to permafrost thawing is likely to be very high.

    \ affecting oil wells."

Quantitative material:
  6: Active layer of permafrost increases with the trend up to 15 cm per decade at
    some sites.
  7: Maintaining and repairing infrastructure as well as its protection from the melting
    permafrost costs 55 billion rubles

    the total annual healthcare budget.
  14: No specific quantitative estimates are provided on this page.
