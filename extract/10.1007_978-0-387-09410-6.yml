    \ 405\u2013408); Landfalling hurricanes (80, 82, 91, 93)"
Highlights:
  37: Water vapor in the Tropical Tropopause Layer (TTL) has a positive climate feedback
    on surface temperatures, potentially increasing warming.
  56: The study identifies long-term natural variability of tropical cyclone activity
    in Australia based on beach ridge sequences at Princess Charlotte Bay, Pormpuraaw
    and Cowley Beach.
  64: Ridge and terrace records in Queensland can be used to reconstruct the intensity
    of tropical cyclones. Height of landforms represents minimum height of storm inundation.
  69: Intense cyclone events that track very close to the site result in the highest
    isotope depletion levels.
  71: The Quaternary record indicates a higher frequency of severe cyclones than previously
    estimated from instrumental records; the 1% AEP event size is more intense than
    instrumental estimates suggest.
  78: There is a statistically significant 10-year lag in the frequency of tropical
    cyclones and hurricanes, even after accounting for other climate indices.
  79: The study finds a statistically significant (p<0.05) negative correlation between
    sunspot number (solar activity) and U.S. hurricane counts, suggesting increased
    solar activity may lead to fewer hurricanes, after accounting for other climate
    variables.
  82: There is an inverse relationship between sunspots and storm intensity, particularly
    for more intense cyclones. The slopes from quantile regression are negative at
    the median and above (Q50, Q75, Q90, Q95, and Q99).
  93: Change-points in hurricane numbers are more easily detectable in basin data
    than in landfall data due to the reduction in the number of storms by a factor
    of four from basin to landfall, making statistical detection more difficult.
  96: Indirect prediction methods can be more accurate than direct methods under certain
    circumstances, especially with a short baseline for basin storm prediction and
    historical landfall probability, because there are more storms in the basin and
    so the signal can be estimated more accurately.
  102: SST is a significant predictor for the number of hurricanes in the Atlantic
    basin. The relationship between SST and landfalling hurricane numbers is only
    marginally significant. The authors suggest that a dependency between SST and
    landfalling hurricane numbers is possible, despite statistical challenges in detecting
    it.
  106: Three of the SST predictions have significantly lower error than the long-term
    mean for predicting Cat 3-5 hurricanes.
  113: The H-index can be used to predict TC development and the model predicts significant
    increases in TC counts in the West Pacific, East Pacific, and Atlantic regions
    due to global warming, alongside changes in their seasonal distribution.
  136: "The landfall proportion for stronger hurricanes (\u2265 89 knots) is smaller\
    \ in warm years than in cold years, and this difference is statistically significant\
    \ for certain genesis sub-regions within the North Atlantic basin."
  143: Basinwide, warm SSTs do not have a significant impact on the probability of
    tropical storms becoming hurricanes, but regional differences may exist. Specifically,
    storms forming in the eastern North Atlantic during warm SST years have a higher
    likelihood of becoming strong hurricanes.
  145: Genesis in 2002 produced storms with a higher than average likelihood of producing
    landfalling TCs. Landfall rates increased during warm SST years especially for
    the Southeast coast of the U.S.
  146: Warm SST years may shift strong hurricane landfall probabilities away from
    the U.S. coast and towards the eastern part of the North Atlantic. Gulf coast
    probabilities decrease during warm years. Strong hurricane landfalls originating
    from the eastern Atlantic occur almost exclusively during warm years.
  147: The darkest shade indicates that 12 to 15 percent of the storms forming in
    that region made landfall as a strong hurricane.
  158: Spring snow cover and TC numbers are basically in-phase. Autumn snow cover
    reacts in an anti-phase manner with TC activity, with zero or small lag times,
    but significant only at decadal periods.
  178: Relational aspects of hurricane activity can be understood using networks and
    how those relationships change under different climate scenarios.
  180: Latitudinal migration of the NA atmospheric system throughout the Holocene
    has implications for the location of hurricane landfalls.
  199: Aerosols change cloud microstructure in a way that allows attributing observed
    lightning structure to effects of continental aerosols; Aerosols decrease convection
    intensity in the TC center leading to some TC weakening; Results suggest that
    aerosols change the intensity and spatial distribution of precipitation in landfalling
    TCs
  215: Aerosols alter convection patterns in tropical cyclones, increasing precipitation
    at a distance but decreasing convection near the eye wall, potentially affecting
    lightning formation.
  217: Continental aerosols increase supercooled cloud water and ice in hurricane
    clouds. Aerosols lead to precipitation over a larger area but weaker intensity
    in the TC center. Increase in aerosol concentration decreases precipitation within
    the TC zone.
  238: There is a diversity of patterns of TC genesis changes in the different climate
    models, with some models showing a similar response pattern in longitude, leading
    to a displacement of TC genesis westward in the North Indian Ocean, South Indian
    Ocean, and South West Pacific.
  247: Detection of possible cyclone development in the future scenario with higher
    SSTs compared to the present climate.
  252: There seems to be no overall trend in the number of most intense cyclones across
    the five models analyzed, though the highest values occur in the last two years
    of the simulation (2071-2100). No clear correlation between aggregate intense
    cyclone frequency and SST was observed. One model with the strongest cyclone intensity
    increase showed the three most intense cyclones occurred during the last decade
    of the simulation and showed a relationship between higher SST areas and intensity
    increase, suggesting SSTs play a role but other factors contribute.
  306: The model captures the basic features of the TC distribution among different
    areas, with the north-western tropical Pacific (WNP) showing the highest mean
    number of TCs per year in both the model and observations. The model tends to
    underestimate the number of TCs, especially in the tropical North Pacific (WNP
    and ENP), but simulates a fairly realistic mean year-to-year variability for each
    area.
  310: The overall warming of tropical SST is characterized by regional patterns,
    with more marked warming in the western part of the Indian Ocean, the equatorial
    Pacific, and along the coast of South America, and weaker warming in the eastern
    tropical Indian Ocean and eastern subtropical Pacific. Increased CO2 induces a
    remarkable enhancement of precipitation along the ITCZ during JJASO, confined
    to a relatively narrow region near the equator. Areas of reduced rainfall are
    located in the southeastern tropical Indian Ocean and south-central Pacific during
    JJASO. During DJFMA, increased precipitation is found south of the equator along
    the southern branch of the double ITCZ, whereas regions of decreased rainfall
    are found in the subtropics.
  312: Increased CO2 leads to warming and increased total precipitation but a reduction
    in convective precipitation, especially in the tropics. The model indicates a
    tendency to attenuate high-frequency convective variability with increased CO2,
    except over the equatorial Pacific.
  314: The page shows the variability and distribution of tropical cyclones over time
    in different regions of the Atlantic and Pacific using box plots.
  325: No relevant information
  334: The model's SST patterns and magnitudes generally agree with observations,
    but the model SSTs are warmer, especially in the eastern Atlantic. The model also
    has warmer SSTs over mid-latitude oceans. The model's surface wind fields are
    in general agreement with observations.
  357: No relevant information
  368: Total losses increase non-linearly, amplifying the role of the most extreme
    events. Adaptation strategies can reduce indirect losses by improving the ability
    of the economy to reconstruct and deal with the consequences of disaster.
  369: The paper emphasizes the main difficulties in the assessment of the economic
    impacts due to climate change and highlights issues on which additional research
    is needed.
  371: Paper emphasizes the need for uncertainty estimates when assessing climate
    change impacts and discusses that hurricane impacts are only a part of broader
    climate change risks.
  374: A 10-fold increase in category 5 hurricane landfall probability in region 3
    (includes New Orleans) under a modified climate scenario. Increased possibility
    of category 4 landfalls in regions 9, 10, and 11 (Virginia to Canadian border,
    including Washington D.C., New York City, and Boston).
  377: Conservative estimate of sensitivity to change in hurricane intensity, with
    notable vulnerability in counties like New York, Miami, New Orleans, Galveston,
    and Currituck.
  381: Hard protection measures like sea walls can negatively impact tourism and fisheries,
    leading to declining local incomes and fish stocks depletion.
  382: EAR increases dramatically for large-scale disasters due to propagation effects
    and production losses during reconstruction.
  383: The model simulates the reconstruction of the region after Hurricane Katrina,
    predicting an 8% instantaneous production reduction and a 10-year reconstruction
    period.
  384: Model underestimates observed growth loss due to inability to reproduce New
    Orleans disorganization.
  385: Total losses, combining production loss and redirection of production to reconstruction,
    are estimated around $154 billion.
  386: Total losses increase nonlinearly with total aggregated direct losses; below
    $40b in direct losses, the economic system dampens the shock, limiting economic
    consequences; above $40b, the economic system is not able to react efficiently;
    the Economic Amplification Ratio (EAR) increases with the size of the disaster.
  387: A 10% increase in potential hurricane intensity translates to a 59% increase
    in total economic losses and doubles the likelihood of a hurricane causing over
    $50 billion in damages.
  388: A resilient economy is less dependent on individual suppliers, can rapidly
    restore production factors, and has access to alternative supply chains through
    imports. Reconstruction speed is limited by shortages of qualified workers in
    specific trades (e.g., glaziers, roofers).
  389: Disasters can be opportunities for improving productivity through technology
    upgrades during reconstruction (e.g., better insulation, new production technologies,
    infrastructure adaptation).
  390: Indirect costs are a significant portion of total costs associated with extreme
    event changes and need to be included in cost estimates; the magnitude of costs
    associated with extreme-event changes are likely to be large; uncertainty regarding
    future climate conditions introduces a cost, requiring more resilient infrastructure
    design; adaptation strategies can yield significant benefits even if hurricane
    frequency and intensity remain unchanged ('no-regret' strategies).
  392: Economic dynamics and embodied technical change are important in assessing
    climate change damages and potential positive consequences of natural disasters.
Methodology:

    Australia, using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating and stratigraphic
    analysis to determine the frequency and intensity of past tropical cyclone events.

    height and times of inundation, respectively. The height of this inundation is
    then related to the intensity of the paleocyclone which is determined through...

    to assess the frequency of extreme cyclones compared to historical/instrumental
    records.
  78: A generalized linear model is used to predict Atlantic tropical cyclone counts,
    accounting for autocorrelation using a 10-year lag term. The model considers tropical
    storms and hurricanes over the period 1914-2006 and hurricane-only over the period
    1900-2006.
  79: Statistical modeling of U.S. hurricane counts using sunspot number as a proxy
    for upper tropospheric temperature, controlling for NAO, SOI, and SST. The model
    is applicable from 1866 or 1878 depending on the data used.
  82: Quantile regression is used to model the relationship between daily sunspot
    number and hurricane intensity. A linear model is used for the regression function.
    The analysis focuses on the western North Atlantic basin.
  90: Uses hurricane data (HURDAT) from 1950 onwards to build relationships between
    SSTs, hurricane numbers in the Atlantic basin, and hurricane numbers at landfall.
    Data before 1900 is not used, and data prior to 1950 is used with caution due
    to data quality issues.

    data versus landfall data, under the assumption of constant probability of landfall
    per storm.
  96: Comparing 'direct' predictions of landfalling hurricanes based on landfall data,
    with 'indirect' predictions that first predict basin hurricane numbers and then
    convert to landfalling numbers using historical probabilities. Also using different
    baseline periods (long, medium, short, mixed) for prediction.
  98: The paper uses historical hurricane data, change-point analysis, mixed baseline
    methods, and climate shift models incorporating expert judgment on the probability
    of shifts in hurricane activity. It considers the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
    (AMO) and examines the probability of regime shifts using a Monte-Carlo re-sampling
    approach.
  102: A five-step process is used to predict SSTs, involving isolating the multidecadal
    oscillation in SST time-series, estimating current and low states, incorporating
    expert estimations of probabilities related to AMO shifts, adding back the non-linear
    trend, and ultimately predicting SSTs over a five-year period. A Poisson Generalized
    Linear Model is used to model the relationship between SST and hurricane numbers.
    The analysis uses data from 1950 to the present.
  104: Uses a Poisson Generalized Linear Model to combine predictions of windshear
    and SST with basin hurricane numbers. Windshear estimates based on climate predictions
    of Vecchi and Soden [2007], and SST estimates from Laepple et al. [2007]. The
    current state is estimated from the historical record, and future changes in windshear
    and SST are taken from IPCC ensemble means.
  106: The paper presents models for predicting the number of US landfalling hurricanes
    based on various assumptions and methods, including long-term mean, medium-term
    mean, different Sea Surface Temperature (SST) models, and variations using North
    Atlantic SST (NH-SST). The models are hindcast from 1960-1964 to 2003-2007.
  107: The paper uses statistical models, including those considering historical averages,
    recent trends, basin hurricanes, and sea surface temperatures, to predict landfalling
    hurricane numbers. It aims to minimize root mean square error (RMSE) for parameter
    choices and model comparison. Expert elicitation is used to weight the models.
  113: A new index (H-index) is developed based on sea surface temperature (SST) and
    evaporation fields to predict TC development. The index is related to the spatial
    mean gradient of the logarithm of surface wind speed with respect to SST. The
    method uses reanalysis and SST data from 1979-2005 to evaluate the H-index and
    its relationship to TC counts. The CSIRO Mk3 climate model is then used to predict
    future TC changes.
  136: Estimates the probability of a storm making U.S. landfall based on the proportion
    of basin TCs that have historically made landfall. The analysis uses data from
    1948-2006
  143: The analysis compares probabilities of storm intensification (to hurricane
    and strong hurricane status) conditioned on warm SSTs versus unconditioned estimates.
    The genesis locations of storms are considered. Climatological values at genesis
    locations were averaged for individual years.
  145: Analysis based on historical hurricane data (1948-2006) and warm SST years.
    Landfall probabilities are estimated based on genesis locations. The methodology
    is a climatological study, not an economic one.

    at genesis locations. Bootstrapping was used to assess statistical significance
    due to small sample sizes.

    intensity changes, along with a literature-based examination of paleoclimatic
    evidence for long-term changes in atmospheric system migration.

    Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale model; numerical simulations
  200: Analysis of lightning activity as an indicator of TC intensity and precipitation.
  215: Numerical Weather Research and Prediction (NWRF) model simulations (NWRP30
    and WR runs) are used to analyze the impact of aerosols on tropical cyclone (TC)
    intensity, convection, precipitation, and lightning. Azimuthally averaged fields
    are used to compare simulations.

    CNRM, CSIRO, MIROC, MRI, NCAR, UKMO_Hadcm3, CCMA, GISS, IPSL, MPI, INGV, UKMO_hadgem1,
    GFDL_cm2_0) to understand the projected changes in TC genesis patterns under climate
    change scenarios. The paper analyzes the zonal and longitudinal variations in
    TC genesis and relates them to larger climate patterns like the Hadley circulation
    and Walker circulation.

    based on thermal symmetry and core temperature.
  306: Uses a model to simulate tropical cyclone activity and compares the results
    to observational data from 1970-1999. The model is evaluated on its ability to
    capture the distribution and variability of tropical cyclones across different
    regions.
  310: Climate scenario experiments using PREIND, 2CO2, and 4CO2 scenarios were used
    to investigate the impacts of greenhouse global warming on tropical mean climate
    and tropical cyclone climatology. Differences between 2CO2 and PREIND (2CO2-PREIND),
    and 4CO2 and PREIND (4CO2-PREIND) seasonal means of SST and precipitation are
    analyzed.

    (SST) and vertical wind shear, averaged from August to October.
  357: Numerical models of the atmosphere are derived fundamentally from the Taylor
    series approximation which relates the value of a continuous function f(x) to
    the known values of the function and its derivatives at a set of discrete points,
    xi.
  368: The paper presents a methodological roadmap to assess macroeconomic damages
    from climate change, using an increase in hurricane intensity in the United States
    as an example. It involves downscaling global climate change to a spatial scale
    using the Emanuel hurricane model, translating probability changes into direct
    economic losses using statistical analysis of historical landfalls, discussing
    adaptation strategies, and using a modified Input-Output model to investigate
    indirect losses due to macroeconomic mechanisms and feedbacks.
  369: The paper aims to propose a methodological roadmap to assess sectoral and regional
    impacts of climate change. It focuses on hurricanes, the end of this century,
    and the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coastline as a case study, summarizing and combining
    analyses from climatology, engineering, and economics within an interdisciplinary
    framework.
  371: Paper demonstrates a methodology to estimate climate change damages by downscaling
    simulations of global climate change and translating changes in hurricane risk
    into economic impacts.
  372: 'The paper discusses downscaling techniques for both socio-economic and climate
    scenarios from global models to a local level for impact assessment. It suggests
    two approaches: (1) downscaling future socio-economic conditions, and (2) assessing
    the impact of future climate on current societies and economies.'
  374: Uses synthetic hurricane tracks (3000 tracks with 1912 landfalls) generated
    by Emanuel's model (2006) under present climate conditions and under conditions
    with a 10% increase in potential intensity to assess the annual probability of
    hurricane landfall. Compares these probabilities to historical data (HURDAT).
  376: 'Two methods are described for assessing the impact of hurricane risk on property
    destruction: physical models and statistical models. Physical models use detailed
    exposure data and vulnerability models to relate hazard levels to damage ratios.
    Statistical models use past hurricane losses and resulting direct economic losses
    to create statistical relationships to predict future damages.'
  377: Assessment of local vulnerability parameters using hurricane wind speed, with
    losses assumed to depend on cubed wind speed as a proxy for energy dissipated.
  382: Introduces the Economic Amplification Ratio (EAR), which measures the ratio
    between the overall economic cost and the direct loss due to a disaster; uses
    Input-Output (IO) models to assess how a shock propagates through intermediate
    consumption and demand.
  383: Adaptive Regional Input-Output (ARIO) model, a modified IO model based on IO
    tables and a hybrid modelling methodology. Takes into account changes in production
    capacity due to productive capital losses and adaptive behaviour in disaster aftermaths.
    Assumes the Louisiana economy will eventually return to its pre-storm situation.
    Results are indicators of disaster seriousness.
  384: Model simulation to assess economic impact.
  385: The model estimates production loss based on sector-specific impacts, reconstruction
    duration, and assumes a return to the initial economic state.
  386: The relationship between direct losses and indirect losses is estimated for
    the state of Louisiana in 2005, and for the consequences of Katrina, using an
    economic model that relates various amounts of direct losses to total losses.
  387: Uses a polynomial regression on the relationship between direct and indirect
    losses calculated for Louisiana and Katrina to assess total losses due to synthetic
    hurricane tracks. Employs the Emanuel's model for generating synthetic tracks
    and assessing changes in hurricane intensity. The analysis uses the present-day
    input-output table, scaled to account for economic growth (though in the present
    analysis, economic growth is disregarded). The methodology assumes that the nonlinearity
    in total losses is valid for all regions and disasters.
  388: Discusses adaptation strategies to reduce indirect losses arising from propagation
    between sectors and production losses during reconstruction by improving economic
    resilience and speeding up reconstruction efforts.
  389: A methodological roadmap is presented to assess climate change economic impacts
    by downscaling climate change projections, translating local changes into direct
    losses, accounting for adaptation strategies, and assessing economic mechanisms
    to account for indirect effects. Applied to hurricanes along the U.S. Atlantic
    and Gulf Coastline.
  390: Uses modelling exercises to assess changes in landfall probabilities, direct
    losses, and indirect losses due to hurricanes; acknowledges that models are not
    perfect and results can vary based on different assumptions.
  392: Use of synthetic hurricane tracks in risk analysis and damage assessment, adaptive
    regional input-output model for economic cost assessment of Katrina.

More Notes:
  56: The paper uses the physical characteristics and dating of coastal ridges as
    proxies for past tropical cyclone events, providing insights into long-term trends
    in cyclone frequency.
  64: The study aims to reconstruct the frequency and intensity of past tropical cyclones
    in Queensland, Australia, using geological evidence.
  71: Current policies may underestimate hazard risks due to reliance on instrumental
    records, and there is hesitancy to accept Quaternary records due to perceived
    imprecision.
  78: The model includes NAO, SOI, and SST as covariates.
  79: The paper speculates that increased solar UV radiation warms the tropopause
    and reduces tropical cyclone intensity.
  82: The paper suggests that over the western Atlantic, including the Caribbean Sea
    and Gulf of Mexico, oceanic heat content is sufficiently large, so the limiting
    thermodynamic factor for tropical cyclones to reach their maximum potential intensity
    (MPI) is the near-sea surface temperature.
  90: The accuracy of hurricane data varies depending on the time period. Landfall
    numbers are considered reasonably accurate since 1900, although intensity estimates
    may be poor. Basin-wide hurricane numbers are considered reasonably accurate since
    1950.
  93: The paper investigates whether changes in hurricane numbers are obscured by
    noise or if the probability of landfall is not constant, potentially canceling
    out basin changes. The paper considers the importance of this question for prediction
    of the number of future landfalling hurricanes.
  98: The paper acknowledges the limitations of using tree ring time-series to estimate
    AMO shifts due to non-stationarity and potential influence from factors beyond
    AMO.
  102: The paper discusses the statistical challenges in linking SST directly to landfalling
    hurricane numbers, attributing the weaker correlation at landfall to a decreased
    signal-to-noise ratio. The paper is focused on developing prediction models based
    on the assumption that such a relationship exists.
  104: The paper focuses on predicting hurricane landfall numbers based on windshear
    and SSTs in the MDR.
  106: The paper focuses on hurricane prediction and model evaluation, not macroeconomic
    or fiscal impacts. Therefore the link to macro-fiscal risks or adaptation costs/benefits
    is not direct.
  136: The sample size for stronger hurricanes is small.
  143: The analysis suggests that while basin-wide probabilities of intensification
    are similar in warm SST years, regional differences in genesis location may impact
    landfalls.
  145: The analysis considers the impact of warm SST on hurricane landfall probabilities,
    suggesting a potential link between ocean conditions and landfall patterns, which
    could have macroeconomic implications.
  146: The study focuses on the risk of storms forming in the North Atlantic becoming
    hurricanes and making landfall along the U.S. coastline. Even small increases
    in underlying probability may be practically significant for those interested
    in subtle frequency modulations brought about by climate (e.g., catastrophe risk
    managers).
  147: The analysis focuses on the location of storm genesis, not directly on macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes. It identifies regions where storms are more likely to intensify
    into strong hurricanes, depending on the year's temperature.
  158: The analysis suggests a complex relationship between cyclone activity and seasonal
    snow cover, with potentially different mechanisms influencing spring and autumn
    snow cover.
  178: The work represents a first step toward understanding relational aspects of
    hurricane activity and suggests building prediction models of network structure
    based on pre-season climate conditions.
  200: The paper uses lightning as a proxy to understand and predict TC intensity
    and precipitation, particularly focusing on landfalling hurricanes. It presents
    an example of lightning activity in Hurricane Katrina (2005).
  215: The study focuses on the microphysical processes within a hurricane and how
    aerosols influence these processes, but does not explicitly link these changes
    to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  217: The study attempts to explain the observed weekly cycle of intensity and precipitation
    of landfalling TCs by linking it to weekly variations of anthropogenic aerosol
    concentration.
  238: The diversity in model projections for TC genesis is potentially linked to
    differences in the simulated sea surface temperature (SST) responses to greenhouse
    gas increases across different models.
  247: Sea surface temperatures are expected to increase significantly in the future
    scenario, as indicated by the line graph showing higher SSTs in the scenario simulation
    compared to the control simulation.
  306: The model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to replicate observed
    patterns of tropical cyclone frequency across different ocean basins. The paper
    acknowledges some unrealistic features of the model, such as a reduction in TCs
    near the equator.
  312: The analysis considers changes in simulated tropical cyclones (TCs) under different
    CO2 concentrations, although the specific results for TC numbers are presented
    in Table 4 (not included on this page).
  314: The different experiments (PREIND, 4CO2, 2CO2) suggest climate model simulations
    under different CO2 concentration scenarios.
  325: This page appears to be a figure from a paper, possibly analyzing relative
    humidity changes (RH700) and genesis potential index (GP) related to climate,
    but it's difficult to determine the specifics without more context. It mentions
    using MPI (likely a model) and comparing pre-industrial (PREIND) to 4xCO2 conditions.
    There are spatial maps presented with contours and color scales, but without a
    clearer description of the analysis and how these relate to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes, it is not possible to identify relevant information.
  334: The model's warmer SSTs are partially attributed to a lack of low-level marine
    stratus and insufficient resolution of the ocean model.
  357: The page focuses on the accuracy of weather models, particularly in predicting
    hurricane behavior, and model grid resolution using adaptive modeling techniques.
    The goal is improved weather forecasts, but the direct link to macroeconomic or
    macro-fiscal outcomes is not present.
  372: The paper highlights the difficulty of predicting future socio-economic trends.
    It also notes that vulnerability to climate change can change over time, especially
    in developing countries due to shifts in economic sectors, improved living standards,
    and better implementation of mitigation policies.
  376: The paper excludes fatalities and injuries from its analysis, assuming they
    can be largely avoided with effective warning and evacuation systems.
  377: The methodology includes identifying data availability issues, with some counties
    lacking sufficient data for vulnerability estimation.
  382: Indirect losses must be estimated in cost-benefit analyses despite difficulties.
    The paper proposes a model to assess a fraction of indirect losses and applies
    it to Hurricane Katrina as an illustration. The paper accounts for propagation
    effects between sectors and reconstruction duration/production loss.
  383: Model results must be considered only as indicators of the disaster's seriousness
    due to uncertainty.
  384: Model does not account for lifeline interruptions, bankruptcy, supply-chain
    issues, or political/practical issues related to reconstruction.
  386: The results would be different for different states or different disasters
    due to varying production capacity of the construction sector or differing affected
    sectors.
  387: The study acknowledges that the IO table is not projected into the future due
    to the uncertainty involved. The analysis focuses on the impact of future hurricane
    risks on the present-day economy, disregarding the impact of economic growth.
  389: The effectiveness of productivity improvements in disaster aftermaths is doubtful
    due to the need for rapid restoration and inheritance constraints from existing
    capital.
  390: The analysis uses only one model for each component, limiting its comprehensiveness;
    Emanuel's model is considered particularly pessimistic regarding future hurricane
    intensity; decision-makers should not ignore these economic costs in designing
    responses to climate change.
  394: The paper examines the interaction of science and politics in climate change
    policy, using hurricanes as a case study. It aims to assess the influence of scientific
    understanding on policy making related to global climate change.

  379: Hurricane Floyd damages were reduced by 80% due to a program to elevate 379
    houses in Belhaven, Florida; If all buildings in South Florida complied with post-Andrew

    losses. Total losses are estimated around $154 billion, with an Economic Amplification
    Ratio of 1.44.
  386: When direct losses are below U.S. $40b, indirect losses are negative; for a
    disaster like Katrina, with about $100 billion direct losses, the Economic Amplification
    Ratio (EAR) is equal to 1.44; for a disaster with $200 billion direct losses,
    the EAR reaches 2.00.
  387: 'Averaged direct losses in the present climate: $1578 million per landfall
    and $980 million per track. Averaged total losses in the present climate: $1426
    million per landfall and $885 million per track. Averaged total losses in the
    modified climate (10% increase in hurricane intensity): $2272 million per landfall
    and $1448 million per track. A 10-percent increase in potential intensity would
    translate into a 59 percent increase in total economic losses. A 10-percent increase
    in potential intensity would double the likelihood of a hurricane landfall causing
    more than $50 billion of damages in the U.S.'

    after the 2004 hurricane season.
