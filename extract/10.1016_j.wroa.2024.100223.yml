Drivers of Risk:
  2: Temporary water scarcity events.
  3: Temporal water scarcity events (droughts) are the primary drivers of risk, with
    two different scenarios (Scenario 1 and Scenario 2) representing different shock
    intensities and timings.
  4: Water scarcity events/droughts.
  5: Temporal water scarcity events, investment behavior models (Myopic, Imperfect
    foresight, Perfect foresight)
  6: Month-long water scarcity events in May and August, with the August event being
    more severe. These are incorporated by reducing water efficiency in the model.
  7: Temporal water scarcity events and different levels of economic openness (Armington
    trade elasticity).
  8: A temporal water scarcity event.
  9: Temporal water scarcity event
Highlights:
  2: Different investment behaviors impact the macro-economy during and after water
    scarcity. Proactive measures are significant. Myopic expectations lead to GDP
    and employment decline.
  3: Water scarcity leads to declines in GDP, investment, employment, and water use.
    The severity and recovery time depend on the intensity and timing of the shock,
    and the investment behavior of firms (myopic vs. foresightful). In Scenario 2,
    a more severe shock leads to a greater decline than Scenario 1. Recovery times
    can extend beyond ten time periods.
  4: Investment foresight plays a crucial role in mitigating the negative economic
    effects of water scarcity. Sectors highly dependent on water (agriculture, food,
    electricity) are negatively impacted. Some sectors may benefit from competitiveness
    effects, cushioning the impact but potentially increasing water use. Policymakers
    should promote anticipation and preparedness among firms to improve resilience.
  5: Agriculture, forestry & fishing sector shows a very negative impact on GDP, investment,
    and water use during water scarcity events across all investment behavior models.
    Accommodation & food services and Recreational sectors have a more positive impact
    on employment and water use.
  6: The study simulates the impact of water scarcity on the German economy using
    different investment assumptions.
  7: More open economies tend to have a positive effect on GDP and water usage, but
    a negative impact on employment during water scarcity events. Firms with perfect
    foresight mitigate negative GDP impacts compared to myopic or imperfect foresight.
  8: Agriculture, forestry, & fishing experience the largest negative impact on GDP,
    employment, and water use due to water scarcity.
  9: Agriculture is the most heavily affected sector by water scarcity, leading to
    significant negative impacts on GDP, employment, and water use.
Methodology:
  2: General equilibrium (CGE) model (DEMACRO-ESS) for Germany, simulating different
    investment behavior specifications (perfect foresight, myopic expectations, and
    imperfect foresight) under water scarcity scenarios. The model allows for causal
    interpretations of the results.
  3: The analysis uses the DEMACRO-ESS simulation model with different investment
    behavior model specifications (Myopic, Imperfect foresight, Perfect foresight)
    to assess the impacts of water scarcity on macroeconomic variables.
  4: The analysis uses a dynamic multi-sectoral CGE model called DEMACRO-ESS, parameterized
    on a 2020 Social Accounting Matrix for Germany. The model incorporates (neo) Keynesian
    characteristics and considers ecosystem services like water and land. The model
    simulates monthly frequency.
  5: DEMACRO-ESS simulation. Extends the standard DEMACRO model to include water and
    land as natural capital. Uses multi-level production functions with CES and Armington
    elasticities. Allows for imperfections in the labor market. Assumes Germany is
    a price taker in financial markets, with fixed tax rates and constant real government
    expenditure.
  6: A computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with different investment behavior
    closures (perfect foresight, myopic, imperfect foresight) is used. The model incorporates
    a bargained real wage function. Scenarios are incorporated by reducing the water
    efficiency parameter.
  7: DEMACRO-ESS model simulation, sensitivity analysis by varying Armington trade
    elasticity.
  8: DEMACRO-ESS simulation under different investment behavior models (Myopic, Imperfect
    foresight, Perfect foresight). Applicable to scenarios of temporal water scarcity.
  9: DEMACRO-ESS simulation model is used to analyze the sectoral effects of water
    scarcity under different investment behavior scenarios (Myopic, Imperfect foresight,
    Perfect foresight).
More Notes:
  2: The qualitative findings and policy recommendations have relevance for other
    countries and regions.
  3: The model considers different investment behavior scenarios (Myopic, Imperfect
    foresight, Perfect foresight), where different degrees of foresight about future
    shocks affects the trajectories of economic variables after the shock.
  4: The study focuses on the impact of water scarcity in Germany, accounting for
    firms' investment foresight using different specifications (myopic, imperfect,
    and perfect). Competitiveness effects are observed in some sectors, mitigating
    negative impacts. The applicability to other countries is potentially limited
    due to the model's parameterization for Germany.
  5: The model incorporates green and blue water, and crops, pastures, and other land
    types as natural capital.
  6: The labour force is fixed, but employment is variable, and labour is mobile across
    sectors. The paper uses a wage curve approach allowing for involuntary unemployment.
  7: The analysis assumes business-as-usual conditions for Germany's trade partners,
    which might not be valid if they also experience water scarcity.
  8: The table presents percentage changes relative to a baseline scenario without
    water scarcity. It differentiates outcomes based on different assumptions about
    investment foresight.
  9: The food and beverage industries are significantly impacted due to their reliance
    on agricultural inputs, even though their direct freshwater consumption is low.
    Some industries, like electrical and vehicle manufacturing, may experience positive
    effects due to changes in consumer spending and competitiveness, but these are
    outweighed by the negative impacts on agriculture and food manufacturing.
