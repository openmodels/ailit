Drivers of Risk:
  1: Water scarcity driven by climate change is identified as a key shock impacting
    economic sectors reliant on water, such as agriculture and energy.
  2: The paper simulates temporary water scarcity events, including a single month-long
    event and a scenario with scarcity in two months, with the second event being
    more severe.
  3: Temporal water scarcity events (droughts) represented as 'shocks'.
  4: Varying levels of investment foresight in response to water scarcity events and
    drought conditions.
  5: Temporal water scarcity events (Scenarios 1 and 2).
  6: Water scarcity events occurring in May and August with varying severity are the
    scenarios used to assess economic resilience.
  7: Temporal water scarcity events
  8: The shocks impacting outcomes are related to a temporal water scarcity event.
  9: Water scarcity is identified as a key driver affecting outcomes across different
    sectors.
Evaluation overview:
  1: The paper uses a dynamic multisectoral model to assess the socio-economic impacts
    of temporary water scarcity at a macro-level, focusing on economic resilience
    and behavioural aspects.
  2: This paper investigates the macro-level socio-economic impacts of water scarcity,
    specifically on GDP, investment, employment, and water use.
  3: GDP, investment, employment, and water use during temporal water scarcity events.
  4: Economic resilience to water scarcity, focusing on GDP, employment, and water
    use across sectors.
  5: Impact on sector effects of GDP, investment, and water use during temporal water
    scarcity events.
  7: Impacts on GDP, investment, employment, and water use during temporal water scarcity
    events
  8: The paper evaluates sectoral impacts on GDP, employment, and water use during
    a temporal water scarcity event.
  9: The page provides an overview of sectoral impacts on GDP, employment, and water
    use during a temporal water scarcity event.
Highlights:
  1: The analysis reveals varying levels of economic resilience, indicating that sectors
    can be negatively impacted or benefit through competitiveness effects, necessitating
    policies promoting anticipation and preparedness.
  2: The paper examines the impacts of different investment decision models on economic
    resilience during and after water scarcity, highlighting the significance of proactive
    measures and quantifying the varying outcomes of investment strategies at the
    individual sector level. Firms with myopic expectations are not prepared for water
    scarcity.
  3: 'Scenario 1: a 0.38% fall in GDP, a 0.37% fall in employment, a 0.45% fall in
    investment, and a reduction in water use of 0.6%. Scenario 2: a 0.89% fall in
    GDP, a 0.86% fall in employment, a 1.04% fall in investment, and a 1.39% reduction
    in water use (myopic foresight).'
  4: Firms with foresight perform better during water scarcity events; agriculture,
    food, and electricity sectors are consistently negatively impacted by drought;
    motor vehicle sector may benefit from competitiveness effects but contribute to
    increased water use.
  5: The heatmap provides a clear visual representation of how each sector's activity
    affects the economy and environment under different management scenarios.
  7: An economy that is more open tends to have a positive effect on GDP and water
    usage, but a negative impact on employment.  Higher levels of economic openness
    are associated with a slight decrease in water usage. Firms with perfect foresight
    perform better than myopic and imperfect foresight scenarios.
  8: The most significant impacts are in sectors such as agriculture, forestry & fishing
    with GDP changes noted up to -14.3% under certain foresight assumptions.
  9: Agriculture is the most heavily affected sector due to its link with groundwater
    conditions and high freshwater consumption.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis incorporates behavioural factors and resilience, and evaluates the
    economic impacts of firms' foresight and responses to water scarcity.
  2: The analysis uses the DEMACRO-ESS model, a general equilibrium (CGE) model focused
    on Germany, incorporating different investment behavior specifications (perfect
    foresight, myopic expectations, imperfect foresight) to simulate the economic
    impacts of water scarcity. The simulations are run on a monthly basis.
  3: DEMACRO-ESS simulation with different investment behavior model specifications.
    Applicable for analyzing the impacts of temporal water scarcity on economic indicators
    and water use.
  4: A custom-built dynamic multi-sectoral CGE model called DEMACRO-ESS, parameterized
    on a 2020 Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for Germany at monthly frequency.
  5: DEMACRO-ESS simulation results using different investment behaviour models (Myopic,
    Imperfect foresight, Perfect foresight). Uses a nested CES production function
    with land and water included as natural capital.
  6: The analysis employs a modelling framework that reduces the water efficiency
    parameter to simulate water scarcity events.

  8: 'The analysis uses DEMACRO-ESS simulation models with varying investment behavior
    specifications: Myopic (MY), Imperfect foresight (IM), and Perfect foresight (PE).'
  9: The analysis uses the DEMACRO-ESS simulation model to evaluate sectoral impacts
    of investment behaviors during water scarcity events.
More Notes:
  2: The model incorporates ecosystem services (ESS), primarily water and land. While
    the empirical model focuses on Germany, the qualitative findings and policy recommendations
    are considered relevant for other countries and regions.
  3: The study compares different investment foresight models (Myopic, Imperfect Foresight,
    Perfect Foresight) to assess how firms' anticipatory behavior affects the economic
    impacts of water scarcity. Results are dependent on model assumptions related
    to investment behavior.
  4: The analysis highlights the importance of promoting anticipation and preparedness
    among firms through policy interventions, especially in water-dependent sectors.
    The model considers behavioural aspects and investment foresight.
  5: Financial flows are not explicitly modeled. Tax rates are fixed, and government
    expenditure are held constant in real terms. Import substitution elasticities
    of 2.7. CES technology is adopted with substitution elasticities equal to 0.3.
  7: "The analysis assumes Germany\u2019s trade partners are operating under business-as-usual\
    \ conditions. Results may not hold true if neighboring European trade partners\
    \ are also experiencing water scarcity."
Quantitative material:
  2: The myopic expectations model results in a decrease of 0.14% in GDP and a 0.17%
    decline in employment due to water scarcity.
  3: Percentage changes from base year for GDP, investment, employment, and water
    use during temporal water scarcity events under different investment behavior
    scenarios (Myopic, Imperfect Foresight, Perfect Foresight).
  4: Appendices B and C provide quantitative results corresponding to the qualitative
    sectoral effects shown in Fig. 2. Appendix A provides a detailed sensitivity analysis
    of key parameters used in the model.

    and a 30% decrease in May and a 35% decrease in August for the second scenario.

    for sectors including agriculture, mining, food, chemicals, and water management
    with varying investment behavior models (e.g., GDP change in agriculture forestry
    & fishing: -14.3% under various foresight assumptions).'
