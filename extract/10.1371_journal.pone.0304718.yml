Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts, including warming, sea ice concentration, and net primary
    production, are identified as key drivers affecting marine ecosystems and fisheries.
  2: Climate change is impacting thermal and sea ice conditions, primary productivity
    fluctuations, and biodiversity redistribution, which contribute to changes in
    fishery stock abundance.
  4: Climate layers (WSIC, WSST, WSBT, and SSBT), SNPP, and bathymetry; climate and
    productivity changes
  5: Changes in fish biomass in response to future climate fluctuations and primary
    productivity, also influenced by limiting factors such as biotic interactions
    and diseases.
  6: The key driver of risk considered is changes in species abundance (biomass),
    which is predicted/projected from ensemble models.
  7: Future changes in fishery resources due to varying socioeconomic pathways and
    the inherent uncertainties in price and cost changes over time.
  8: Changes in physical and biogeochemical variables; declined cold pool feature;
    warming of winter sea bottom and surface temperatures; loss of winter sea ice;
    decline in summer integrated primary production
  10: Various climate scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585) indicating different
    levels of greenhouse gas emissions drive the shifts in fish distribution.
  11: Changes in the abundance-weighted center of gravity (COG) of various fish species
    are projected under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) due to climate
    change.
  12: Climate change scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585) drive changes in species
    distribution and abundance.
  14: The primary driver of risk is future climate change, specifically changes in
    sea surface and bottom temperatures, sea ice concentration, and primary production.
    The analysis uses different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to model future
    climate scenarios.
  15: Future climate change, specifically warming and sea ice loss in the NEBS and
    Chukchi Sea.
  16: Shifting fish abundance in response to climate change is a key driver of risk.
  17: Projected MCP (Mean Center of Population) increases in NEBS (Northeast Bering
    Sea) and Chukchi Sea. Anticipated increase in species abundance. Shifting marine
    fisheries resources between the US and Russian EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone).
    Declines in winter sea ice and summer cold pool extent in the EBS (Eastern Bering
    Sea). Poleward shifts in abundance and distribution of warm-adapted taxa. Climate
    change.
  18: Climate-driven changes in species abundance are considered as primary drivers
    impacting fishery resources.

    (MSY) within the US Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the eastern Bering Sea.

    (MCP), maximum revenue potential (MRP), and maximum profit potential (MPP).

    catch, revenue, and profit potential related to changes in fishery resources driven
    by climate change.
  23: Future redistribution of fishery resources suggests biological and economic
    trade-offs.
Highlights:
  1: The most important outcomes include potential shifts in species abundance and
    distribution, with contrasting impacts across different climate scenarios, such
    as declining catches for valuable fisheries under SSP585.
  2: The analysis examines changes in projected abundance of commercially-important
    marine species in the eastern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea.
  4: Machine learning algorithms outperform conventional regression models in predicting
    species distribution and abundance; tuned RF and BRT models for species-specific
    predictions; model complexity and parsimony are balanced to avoid overfitting
  6: The analysis focuses on maximum catch potential as a proxy for maximum sustainable
    yield for species stocks in the EBS and Chukchi Sea.
  7: The main findings suggest robustness to different assumptions of price and cost
    changes, with notable trends in economic variables despite varying magnitudes.
  8: Under future conditions, the COGs of abundance for all species are projected
    to shift northwards; COG shifts result in increasing overlap in areas of peak
    abundance within the present-day fishing grounds in both countries.
  10: The analysis finds varying degrees of fish distribution shifts, with minimal
    changes under SSP126 and significant to major shifts under SSP370 and SSP585.
  11: For abundant cod and flatfish taxa, future abundance declines are observed in
    the EBS (Eastern Bering Sea) and increases in the Chukchi Sea. Arrowtooth flounder
    showed future abundance increase limited only to the EBS. Abundance changes revealed
    opposite patterns between low (flathead sole and Alaska plaice) and high (snow
    crab and Greenland halibut) economic value species.
  12: "Future redistribution of fishery resources suggests biological and economic\
    \ trade-offs. MCP increases in the Chukchi Sea are accounted for by increases\
    \ in the abundance of high catch and low economic value taxa. The basin-wide percent\
    \ differences in MCP, MRP, and MPP were highest during the late-century (2081\u2013\
    2100) under SSP585."
  14: The analysis highlights a contrast between low (SSP126) and high (SSP585) future
    climate scenarios, with significant declines in MRP and MPP in the latter. Slight
    increases in MCP in the near term (2021-2040 and 2041-2060) do not translate to
    increases in MRP and MPP.
  15: "Projected increases in MCP in the NEBS and Chukchi Sea under the extreme warming\
    \ and sea ice loss scenario in 2081\u20132100 did not necessarily translate into\
    \ significant increases in MRP and MPP, suggesting altered economic benefits due\
    \ to changes in catch composition."
  16: Even for well-managed ecosystems like the EBS, a high greenhouse gas emission
    scenario could lead to serious economic impacts on fisheries, potentially from
    the loss of high-value taxa. Population shifts and declines have already been
    witnessed due to warming and sea ice loss.
  17: Future redistribution of fishery resources could lead to governance and management
    issues for transboundary fish stocks and elevated risks of fisheries conflicts.
    Shifting fishing grounds can challenge resource managers and stakeholders, exacerbating
    overexploitation risks. Changes in species distribution can lead to ecological
    shifts, increased competition, and alterations in predator-prey dynamics. The
    analysis provides an outlook into future climate change impacts useful for devising
    climate-ready adaptation and conservation measures.
  18: "Despite limitations, the results suggest limited economic impact in well-managed\
    \ marine ecosystems under low to moderate levels of climatic changes in the near-term\
    \ (2021\u20132040), but highlight the need for mitigation strategies as climate\
    \ change reaches extreme conditions."
  23: Ecosystem-based fisheries management forestalls climate-driven collapse (Holsman
    et al., 2020). There are persistent uncertainties in ocean net primary production
    climate change projections at regional scales (Tagliabue et al., 2021). The status
    of climate change adaptation in fisheries management is assessed in terms of policy,
    legislation and implementation (Bryndum-Buchholz et al., 2021).
Methodology:
  1: The analysis projects future changes in abundance for eight commercially important
    species in the eastern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea under different CMIP6 Shared
    Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs), from 2021 to 2100.
  2: The analysis uses a bioeconomic modeling approach with future climate and ocean
    productivity projections under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) from CMIP6
    models.
  4: "Machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and Boosted Regression Trees) are\
    \ used to predict and project species abundance based on climate layers, SNPP,\
    \ and bathymetry; models are tuned using RMSE; models are trained and evaluated\
    \ using 80% and 20% of observations, respectively; data from summer bottom trawl\
    \ surveys and Arctic ecosystem integrated surveys; present data from 2000-2019\
    \ and future projections for 2021\u20132040 and 2041\u20132060"
  5: The analysis applies ensemble model predictions/projections of species abundance,
    using weighted averages from random forests (RF) and boosted regression trees
    (BRT), and calculates MSY based on species-specific abundance within the EEZ using
    historical biological reference values.
  6: The paper uses species-specific population growth rates (g), species abundance
    (B), a scaling parameter (;) of the Pella-Tomlinson yield curve to determine maximum
    sustainable yield (MSY). It calculates MCP based on species biomass and reference
    exploitation rates. It assumes constant prices and costs over time. Analysis covers
    present-day (2000-2019) and future periods (2021-2100).
  7: The analysis uses bioeconomic modeling to estimate MCP, MRP, and MPP, alongside
    sensitivity analyses under three scenarios of changing costs and prices.
  8: "Bioeconomic changes between US and Russian waters of the Eastern Bering Sea\
    \ were explored; Present-day fishing grounds identified as pixels of high aggregated\
    \ fishing effort (\u2265 1000 fishing hrs) using annually aggregated fishing effort\
    \ from 2012 to 2020 from the global fishing watch online repository; Species distribution\
    \ and abundance models were influenced by depth, bottom temperatures (SSBT and\
    \ WSBT), and summer net primary production (SNPP); Future conditions and varying\
    \ magnitudes of climate change project shifts in center of gravity (COG) of abundance."
  11: The analysis projects the shift in the abundance-weighted center of gravity
    of fish species under different SSPs. The results are applicable for the time
    period 2021-2100, relative to a baseline of 2000-2019.
  12: Spatial distribution of species is modeled for present (2000-2019) and future
    (2041-2060; 2081-2100) periods under different SSP scenarios. Changes in MCP,
    MRP, and MPP relative to the present-day period are calculated.
  14: The study uses modeling to project future changes in fishery resources and economic
    potential under different climate scenarios (SSPs). The results are applicable
    to the study area as a whole.
  15: Simple bioeconomic analyses are applied to spatio-temporal projections of species
    abundance. Analysis periods are present (2000-2019) and future (2021-2100) under
    SSP126 and SSP585 scenarios.
  16: The analysis uses aggregated fishing effort data from 2012-2020 overlaid with
    present-day fishing grounds. Future maximum catch, revenue, and profit potential
    are projected under SSP126 and SSP585 scenarios.
  17: Scenario-based projections of climate changes and their impacts on commercially
    exploited fisheries in the EBS and Chukchi Sea. The analysis uses taxon-specific
    abundance projections and biological estimates of fishable biomass derived from
    machine learning models, with some limitations. Published species-specific biological
    parameters for the US BSAI species stocks were used and assumed constant across
    present and future periods.
  18: The analysis uses data on projected species abundance under future climate and
    socioeconomic pathways and considers economic parameters like ex-vessel prices
    and fishing costs, assumed constant over time.
  23: "Various modeling approaches are used in the cited papers, including population\
    \ dynamics models (Quinn, 2003), biogeochemical models (S\xB4efe\xB4rian et al.,\
    \ 2020), and multispecies size spectrum models (Reum et al., 2020)."
More Notes:
  1: Projected changes in abundance and distribution could significantly affect the
    productivity of commercial and subsistence fisheries, with implications for trans-boundary
    resource management.
  4: Data accessed from NOAA Fisheries online repository (https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/foss/);
    study area includes the eastern Bering Sea and US Chukchi Sea area
  6: The paper extends data timeframes for some species stocks to standardize to a
    common baseline year (2012), assuming constant exploitation rates in the future.
    It acknowledges that constant price/cost assumptions are a limitation.
  8: Analysis uses SSP585 as an extreme shared socio-economic pathway.
  12: The analysis focuses on the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and Chukchi Sea. Low-value
    species exhibited substantial increases in the middle domain of the EBS and Chukchi
    Sea between 2041 and 2100. The severity of changes in MCP tends to increase with
    scenario severity and longer projected time horizons.
  15: The study compares future MCPs with distance from major fishing and Arctic ports
    in the EBS under different socioeconomic pathways and finds divergent patterns
    compared to the present, potentially impacting fishing fleet mobility.
  16: The analysis stresses the importance of fisheries management in adapting to
    and mitigating the negative impacts of climate change. Longer transit times between
    fishing grounds and ports with processing facilities are a potential trade-off.
  17: The study acknowledges uncertainties arising from simple biological and economic
    assumptions, the limited subset of fisheries included, and the use of machine
    learning models for biomass estimation.
