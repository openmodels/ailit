Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts (warming, sea ice concentration, net primary production)
    on fish and crab abundance and distribution, socio-economic pathways (SSPs), and
    future shifts in species distributions.
  2: Climate-driven changes in thermal and sea ice conditions, primary productivity
    fluctuations, and redistribution of overall marine biodiversity.
  6: Future redistribution of fishery resources due to sea change. Changes in species
    abundance predicted from ensemble models.
  7: Future redistribution of fishery resources
  11: Redistribution of fishery resources and spatial distribution changes in fish
    species abundance due to climate change.
  12: Climate change scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585) leading to redistribution
    of fishery resources.
  13: Future redistribution of fishery resources due to climate change (implied through
    SSP scenarios). Reduction and shift in abundance of low-catch and high-economic
    value species.
  14: Climate change impacts on marine species distributions and fishery resources.
  15: Future climate change, specifically warming and sea ice loss, impacts major
    commercial fisheries.
  16: Shifting fish abundance in response to climate change; Greenhouse gas emission
    scenarios; Sea ice loss.
  17: Climate change is driving changes in fishery resources, impacting species abundance
    and distribution between US and Russian waters, causing potential governance and
    overexploitation issues.
  18: Climate-driven changes in species abundance.  Future redistribution of fishery
    resources. Climate change approaching extreme conditions of warming and sea ice
    loss.
Highlights:
  1: Future redistribution of fishery resources suggests biological and economic trade-offs
    according to the severity of the emission scenario.
  2: Climate change has resulted in ecological surprises such as the recent collapse
    of valuable fisheries resources (e.g., snow crab and Pacific cod) in the Bering
    Sea, resulting in significant loss of livelihoods and revenue streams.
  6: Future redistribution of fishery resources has economic trade-offs. Maximum Catch
    Potential (MCP) is used as a proxy for Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) and is
    used to determine changes in revenue.
  7: Sensitivity analysis showed similar trends in economic variables, though magnitude
    varied slightly compared to the constant prices and costs scenario, suggesting
    findings are robust to different assumptions on prices and costs over time; Bioeconomic
    implications of future species abundance fluctuations were examined, and future
    percent changes in total MCP, MRP, and MPP relative to the present were computed
  11: The shift in fishery resource distribution suggests biological and economic
    trade-offs with potential abundance declines and collapses in high-value species
    under certain SSP scenarios.
  12: Future redistribution of fishery resources suggests biological and economic
    trade-offs, with changes in MCP, MRP, and MPP varying across time periods and
    climate scenarios. MCP increases in the Chukchi Sea are due to increases in low
    economic value species.
  13: Future redistribution of fishery resources suggests biological and economic
    trade-offs. MCP is projected to change differently under different SSP scenarios,
    with varying impacts depending on location (e.g., Dutch Harbor vs. Port of Nome)
    and distance from major landing ports. Abundance trends vary with distance away
    from the ports. SSP585 shows the most significant increases overall.
  14: Significant declines in MRP and MPP especially under high emissions scenarios
    (e.g., SSP585).
  15: Projected increases in MCP in the NEBS and Chukchi Sea under extreme warming
    do not necessarily translate to significant increases in MRP (Marginal Revenue
    Product) and MPP (Marginal Physical Product), suggesting changes in catch composition
    alter potential economic benefits.
  16: Future redistribution of fishery resources suggests biological and economic
    trade-offs; high greenhouse gas emission scenarios could lead to serious economic
    impacts on fisheries, potentially from the loss of high-value taxa.
  17: The movement of fish stock due to climate change can lead to increased governance
    challenges, overexploitation risks, and possible shifts to lower-value species.
  18: "For well-managed marine ecosystems like the EBS, effects of climate change\
    \ can, to some extent, have limited economic impact in the near-term (2021\u2013\
    2040) under low to moderate levels of climatic changes. Mitigation and conservation\
    \ efforts may demand changes to current conservation and management strategies.\
    \ Forward-looking and climate-smart solutions are necessary to support future\
    \ global food and nutritional security and sustain fisheries-reliant sectors under\
    \ climate change."
Methodology:
  1: Projected future changes in abundance of eight commercially important fish and
    crab species in the eastern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea under different CMIP6 Shared
    Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs).
  2: Bioeconomic model analysis to assess species-specific abundance changes of major
    fisheries resources in the Pacific Arctic and subsequent fluctuations in maximum
    catch, revenue, and abundance changes under future climate scenarios using CMIP6
    models and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP).
  6: Calculates MSY using a Pella-Tomlinson yield curve with species-specific parameters.
    Computes MCP using model-derived species biomass and reference exploitation rates.  Calculates
    revenue assuming constant prices and costs over time. Analysis covers present-day
    (2000-2019) and future periods (2021-2100) with 20-year intervals.
  7: Bioeconomic modeling to assess the implications of future species abundance fluctuations
    on MCP, MRP, and MPP, relative to the present, under different Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSPs); Sensitivity analysis examining the influence of prices and costs
    on the main results, with scenarios including increasing costs, increasing prices,
    and increasing both by 20% at a constant rate until 2100
  12: Spatial distribution modeling of fishery resources under different climate change
    scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585) comparing present (2000-2019) and future
    periods (2041-2060, 2081-2100).
  13: Analysis of MCP changes under different SSP scenarios, comparing future catch
    potential to present-day levels (2000-2019). Analysis of maximum catch, revenue,
    and profit potential between different present-day fishing grounds in the US and
    Russian waters. Results are applicable to future periods from 2041 to 2100.
  14: Analysis based on projections of SSP scenarios using updated CMIP6 climate and
    productivity projections, focusing on fisheries.
  15: Bioeconomic analyses are applied to spatio-temporal projections of species abundance
    to understand biological and economic impacts. Analysis uses shared socioeconomic
    pathways (SSP126, SSP585).
  16: Spatial distribution of aggregated fishing effort is analyzed alongside differences
    between present and future maximum catch, revenue, and profit potential under
    different SSP scenarios. The analysis uses fishing mortality rates at healthy
    levels.
  17: Scenario-based projections and machine learning models are used to forecast
    the availability of fisheries, but with noted uncertainties and limitations in
    biological and economic assumptions.
  18: Economic analysis is a simple first-cut attempt to elucidate potential impacts
    of climate-driven changes in species abundance. Analysis based on future abundance
    projections under contrasting time periods and climate scenarios (Supporting Information
    S1 File).
More Notes:
  1: Projected changes in species abundance suggest that fishing at the same distance
    from the current major port in the Bering Sea (i.e., Dutch Harbor) could yield
    declining catches for highly valuable fisheries (e.g., Pacific cod and snow crab)
    under SSP585.
  2: The study focuses on the Pacific Arctic region, specifically the eastern Bering
    Sea and Chukchi Sea, and intends to capture taxon-specific future redistribution
    of fishery resources.
  6: The analysis assumes constant prices and costs over time, acknowledging this
    is a simplification. The study focuses on groundfish and snow crab in the Bering
    Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI), Eastern Bering Sea (EBS), and Chukchi Sea.
  7: The study focuses on the US territorial waters of the Eastern Bering and Chukchi
    seas
  12: The study focuses on the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and Chukchi Sea. The severity
    of the climate scenario is positively correlated with increases to MCP.
  13: The US-Russia EEZ boundary and bathymetric contours are overlaid on the maps.
    S8D Fig and S8 Table in S1 File contains additional relevant information. Changes
    in MRP and MPP are affected by reduction and shift in low-catch and high-economic
    value species.
  16: The study considers the trade-offs of longer transit times between fishing grounds
    and ports with processing facilities.
  18: The economic parameters used (e.g., ex-vessel prices and fishing costs) are
    based on published regional values and assumed to remain constant over time, which
    is a limitation. There are structural uncertainties from Earth System Models including
    those stemming from the incomplete understanding and constraints from the lack
    of sufficient observation data.
