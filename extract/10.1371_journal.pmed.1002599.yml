Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, increased air conditioning use
  2: Climate change leading to increased air conditioning demand and subsequent power
    sector emissions; direct effects of climate change on atmospheric chemistry and
    biogenic emissions.
  3: Climate change leading to increased temperatures, increased use of air conditioning,
    and subsequent increases in harmful emissions from power plants.
  9: Climate change adaptation of cooling demand leading to air-quality-related health
    impacts, specifically power sector emissions impacting air quality.
  10: Increased cooling demand due to warmer temperatures, leading to increased electricity
    production and emissions. The additional electricity capacity in mid-century is
    generated by natural gas power plants.
  11: Increased cooling demand driven by higher temperatures in a mid-century climate
    change scenario
  12: Climate change leading to increased cooling demand, and the subsequent increase
    in electricity production, particularly from fossil fuel sources, to meet that
    demand is driving the risk.
  13: Climate change adaptation (specifically, changes in cooling demand leading to
    altered power plant emissions).
  16: Climate change adaptation of cooling demand increases EGU NOx emissions leading
    to air quality impacts.
  17: Climate change, specifically its impact on cooling demand, leading to changes
    in PM2.5 and O3 levels and subsequent health impacts.
  19: Climate change, adaptation of cooling demand leading to increased air pollution.
  20: Increased air conditioning use in response to a warmer mid-century climate increases
    emissions and degrades air quality.
Highlights:
  1: No relevant information
  2: "Approximately 5%\u20139% of exacerbated air-pollution-related mortality will\
    \ be due to increases in power sector emissions from heat-driven building electricity\
    \ demand without intervention. A portion of health impacts from air pollution\
    \ due to climate change is attributable to adaptive behavior (extra air conditioning\
    \ use)."
  3: Increased air conditioning, as an adaptation to warmer temperatures, exacerbates
    climate-change-related air quality and leads to additional premature deaths and
    significant economic costs.
  9: "The study explores the health impacts of power sector emissions on air quality\
    \ in a changing climate due to adaptation measures of cooling demand. The American\
    \ Cancer Society\u2019s Cancer Prevention Study II is particularly relevant for\
    \ PM2.5-related mortality estimates due to its representative exposure sites and\
    \ long follow-up period."
  10: Adaptation through air conditioning use constitutes a positive climate feedback,
    increasing electricity demand and CO2 emissions. While the increase in emissions
    is offset by more efficient energy sources, adaptation through cooling still constitutes
    a positive feedback loop
  11: Climate change-induced increases in temperature and subsequent cooling demand
    lead to increased emissions, particularly of NOx and SO2, impacting air quality.
    The distribution of emissions becomes less uniform in the mid-century climate.
  12: Air conditioning adaptation to climate change in the eastern US leads to increased
    emissions and air pollution. Adaptation behaviors (increased air conditioning)
    contribute a small percentage to the overall increase in PM2.5 and O3 concentrations
    due to climate change.
  13: Adaptation measures can lead to both increases and decreases in air pollution
    concentrations, varying by region and pollutant. Greatest increase in EGU emissions.
  16: Adapting to climate change increases mortality compared to climate change alone
    due to increased air pollution. Air quality degradation induced by adaptation
    causes greater premature mortalities and significant additional costs.
  17: The health impacts of projected mid-century building energy use on PM2.5 and
    O3 levels, specifically the increase in mortality and associated costs, are highlighted.
    Adaptation (MCA) compared to the climate only scenario (MCCO) provides estimates
    of the health costs.
  19: Adaptation yields an 8.7% increase in deaths above climate change impacts alone,
    with 8.0% of additional deaths in the MCA scenario from adaptation and 92.0% from
    climate change alone.
  20: Adaptive behaviors like increased air conditioning in response to climate change
    can significantly degrade air quality and increase health burdens, with adaptation
    contributing 5-8% of the overall health burden from air pollution.
Methodology:
  1: Interdisciplinary linked model system including WRF, RBESS, MyPower, CMAQ, and
    BenMAP. Applicable to a representative mid-century climate scenario in the eastern
    United States.
  2: The study uses modeling to estimate future air-pollution-related health damages
    caused by the power sector through heat-driven air conditioning adaptation in
    buildings, focusing on one model-year of future climate simulations for the month
    of July. It applies concentration-response functions to estimate mortality increases
    and associated costs.
  3: Computer models were used to calculate air pollution and health impacts with
    and without increased air conditioning. The value of statistical life (VSL) was
    used to estimate the cost of deaths, based on a literature review of 26 studies.
  9: "The analysis uses the EPA\u2019s BenMAP\u2013Community Edition version 1.3 to\
    \ calculate the incidence of adverse health outcomes given changes in air quality.\
    \ It relies on expert-derived PM2.5 exposure\u2013response functions and O3 C-R\
    \ functions used for NAAQS evaluations. Simulations were run for July using CMAQ\
    \ with boundary conditions from the Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers,\
    \ version 4."
  10: Impact estimates are based on exacerbated pollution in July alone. Annual impacts
    are calculated as a 3-month summer average based on July modeling. Changes in
    air pollution and health impacts are analyzed, focusing on the incremental impact
    of adaptation. Health impacts for PM2.5 and O3 related mortality are calculated
    using existing impact functions applied to changes in July exposure and scaled
    to annual estimates.
  11: Simulation of electricity production and emissions based on temperature dependence,
    comparing present-day and mid-century climates. Existing power plant inventory
    is maintained without simulating retirements of coal-fired plants or market-driven
    renewable energy investments.
  12: The paper analyzes air quality under present-day (PD), mid-century climate only
    (MCCO), and mid-century with adaptation (MCA) scenarios. It uses histograms to
    compare hourly electricity production and emissions in present-day and warmer
    climate scenarios.
  13: Comparison of a 'climate-only' scenario (MCCO) to an 'adaptation' scenario (MCA)
    to assess the impact on air pollution concentrations during the mid-century; examination
    of the distribution of regional average concentrations of air pollution as a function
    of air pollution level.
  16: Health impacts are quantified using BenMAP, with health impact functions based
    on EPA-selected epidemiological studies and expert elicitation. Mortality is calculated
    based on MDA8 concentrations and maximum daily 1-hour concentrations of O3. Analysis
    is based on July modeling to estimate annual impacts.
  17: The analysis uses concentration-response (C-R) functions from various expert
    sources and epidemiological studies to estimate mortality incidence and associated
    economic costs. It compares scenarios, including mid-century climate-only (MCCO),
    mid-century adaptation (MCA), and present-day (PD). Different C-R functions are
    used, with varying age ranges.
  19: Calculated premature mortality from all causes and MDA8 O3 exposure based on
    multiple studies. Calculated mortality using maximum daily 1-hour concentrations.
    Assessed health impacts for various endpoints, including hospital admissions and
    respiratory symptoms. Using BenMAP to estimate health impacts but unable to account
    for pollutant interaction effects.
  20: Simulates adaptive behavior to a warmer mid-century climate and models building
    energy demand and electricity dispatch to determine impacts on emissions and air
    quality.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on air quality-related health impacts, not macroeconomic or
    macro-fiscal outcomes directly.
  2: The study's limitations include modeling only a single month and relying on one
    model-year of future climate simulations, thus focusing on potential damages rather
    than projecting future conditions.
  3: The study highlights the need for cleaner energy sources, energy efficiency,
    and energy conservation to mitigate the adverse health impacts of increased cooling
    demand due to climate change.
  9: The study acknowledges that results are exploratory and illustrative due to using
    a single year of climate simulations and focusing on July. It also mentions that
    comparative analysis of the benefits of air conditioning for reducing direct heat-related
    mortality versus air pollution effects from air-conditioning-related electricity
    demand is beyond the scope of the study.
  10: The study focuses on July, taking it as representative of the entire summer,
    but acknowledges that spring and fall may also exhibit increased air pollution
    and adverse health outcomes.
  11: The analysis intentionally maintains the existing power plant inventory and
    avoids simulating retirements/investments to explore interactions between climate,
    energy production and air quality without being predictive.
  12: "The study focuses on the eastern US. The analysis is limited to July. The air\
    \ quality impacts are a downstream effect of increased electricity demand, which\
    \ is driven by a 3.5\u02DAC warmer summer."
  13: A small decrease in concentrations (<2.5%) is observed in the southeast, centered
    over South Carolina and the Chesapeake Bay. This is primarily due to a decrease
    in emissions in these regions (as seen in Fig 5) associated with power plant dispatch
    changes.
  16: The study acknowledges limitations in comparing results to NAAQS due to differences
    in averaging periods (hourly vs. annual) and spatial scales (regional vs. county/state).
    It highlights the relevance to attainment of regulatory standards even if they
    cannot be directly compared.
  17: The reported costs are likely underestimates of broader macro-fiscal impacts.
    The analysis considers PM2.5-related mortality and costs using different exposure-response
    functions from various experts and studies.
  19: The spatial distributions of mortality are shown by county in Fig 7 for PM2.5
    and O3 (maximum daily 1-hour and MDA8). Independent health impact estimates from
    PM2.5 and O3 cannot be directly summed because of the inability to account for
    interaction effects.
  20: Power sector emissions are controllable by technology and policy, offering avenues
    for mitigating the adverse health impacts of increased air conditioning use. End-of-pipe
    technological controls can reduce pollution exposure, but increase energy use
    and carbon emissions. Building energy efficiency measures, renewable energy sources,
    demand response programs, and building codes offer alternative interventions.
