Drivers of Risk:
  3: Warmer climate, greater use of air conditioning, harmful emissions from power
    plants
  4: Increased air conditioning demand due to warmer temperatures leads to increased
    power plant emissions on hot days, impacting air quality and public health.
  5: Climate change on air quality with and without associated heat-driven changes
    in emissions from the electricity sector; Levels of ground-level O3 and PM2.5;
    Meteorology consistent with present-day conditions and a warm mid-century summer
    climate
  8: Increased cooling demand due to warm-climate scenarios, leading to changes in
    electricity sector dispatch and subsequent changes in emissions (NOx, SO2, CO2).
  9: Climate change adaptation of cooling demand; Power sector emissions in a changing
    climate
  10: The key driver of risk is changes in energy demand associated with warmer summer
    temperatures, which lead to increased electricity production and emissions.
  11: Changing sensitivity of electricity generation as a function of temperature;
    increased cooling demand; shifts in hourly temperature distributions; increases
    in average hourly emissions of NOX and SO2.
  12: "3.5\u02DAC warmer summer"
  13: Climate change, adaptation of cooling demand, changes in emissions (specifically
    EGU emissions)
  14: Climate change is a driver of risk, leading to higher temperatures and increased
    electricity demand for cooling, which subsequently increases emissions. Biogenic
    emissions enhanced under a warmer climate also contribute to increased PM2.5.
  15: "Air quality changes due to climate change adaptation of cooling demand are\
    \ impacting outcomes by affecting ambient concentrations of pollutants like PM\u2082\
    .\u2085 and O\u2083."
  16: Increases in EGU NOX emissions, changes in electricity dispatch, building energy
    use, high O3 days, high PM2.5 hours, and increased July exposure to PM2.5 and
    O3.
  17: Climate change adaptation of cooling demand impacting PM2.5 levels.
  18: The drivers of risk are changes in ozone (O3) concentrations, influenced by
    climate change and adaptation strategies related to cooling demand. Specifically,
    the scenarios compared include mid-century climate-only (MCCO), mid-century adaptation
    (MCA), and present-day (PD) conditions.
  19: Adaptation related to climate change cooling demand is identified as a factor
    impacting air quality-related health outcomes.
  21: Power plants and heat-driven electricity demand in buildings as an insufficiently
    understood mechanism of future air-quality-related health damages in a warmer
    climate

Highlights:
  3: Increased air conditioning exacerbates climate-change-related air quality impacts;
    Need for cleaner energy sources, energy efficiency, and energy conservation
  4: Increased air conditioning use as a climate change adaptation can lead to increased
    pollution emissions from power plants, which pose public health risks.
  5: First study to compare the impact of potential mid-century climate change on
    air quality with and without associated heat-driven changes in emissions from
    the electricity sector.
  8: The study quantifies the potential damages of interactions between climate, energy
    use, and air quality through a previously unstudied mechanism, focusing on air
    quality impacts of adapting to climate change by increasing cooling demand.
  9: Findings are meant to be exploratory and illustrative due to being based on a
    single year of climate simulations.
  10: The adaptation through increased air conditioning use presents a positive climate
    feedback loop, increasing electricity demand and emissions, which further exacerbate
    air-quality issues.
  11: Temperature dependence plays a greater role in emissions in the mid-century
    climate. Average hourly emissions of NOX and SO2 increase due to greater frequency
    of emissions at higher levels. Maximum hourly emission rates for NOX and SO2 do
    not increase because peak demand is met by natural gas plants.
  12: Air conditioning adaptation to climate change in the eastern US is responsible
    for hourly average emissions increases of 13.7% for NOX, 17.2% for SO2, and 18.5%
    for CO2.
  13: PM2.5 and O3 concentrations generally increase in the Midwest and Northeast
    under the adaptation scenario, while some areas in the Southeast show slight decreases.
    Greatest increase in pollution coincides with greatest increase in EGU emissions.
  14: "Climate change alone increases PM2.5 concentrations, and adaptation through\
    \ air conditioning further exacerbates this increase due to increased emissions\
    \ of SO\u2082 and NOx from EGUs."
  15: "The analysis shows increases in average concentrations of PM\u2082.\u2085 and\
    \ O\u2083 under mid-century climate projections, both with and without adaptation\
    \ measures."
  16: 'Adaptation to climate change accounts for a 4.8% increase over the impacts
    from climate change alone regarding premature deaths, with an average of 654 deaths
    ($6 billion) annually caused by adaptation. Climate change alone causes 12,906
    additional premature deaths (mean estimate range across studies: 1,254 to 25,227),
    with mean costs of $120 billion.'
  17: Climate change adaptation of cooling demand increases PM2.5 and Ozone which
    results in increased mortalities and costs.
  18: The paper finds that using maximum daily 1-hour O3 concentrations, compared
    to MDA8 O3 concentrations, results in higher estimates of mortality from all causes
    and more non-accidental deaths. For the MCA-MCCO scenario, one study found 369
    additional deaths using maximum daily 1-hour O3.
  19: A notable outcome is that 8.0% of additional deaths in the adaptation scenario
    come from adaptation compared to 92.0% from climate impacts alone, highlighting
    an 8.7% increase due to adaptation effects on air quality.
  21: Highlights the interactions amongst climate, electricity production, air quality,
    and health.
  23: Impacts of climate change on air quality, including ozone and particulate matter,
    in the United States
  24: The references suggest that changes in temperature and energy demand influence
    air quality and have subsequent impacts on human health. Several studies focus
    on the effects of NOx and SO2 emissions from power plants. Some studies assess
    co-benefits of climate policies, renewable energy, and energy efficiency.
Methodology:
  3: Computer models were used to calculate air pollution and health impacts of a
    warmer climate with and without greater use of air conditioning
  5: A system of linked numerical models to assess changes in building energy demand,
    electricity production, power sector emissions, air quality, and human health
    outcomes based on meteorology consistent with present-day conditions and a warm
    mid-century summer climate. Focus on the eastern US. Models used include RBESS,
    MyPower, CMAQ, and BenMAP. Simulations performed for Present-Day (2011), Mid-Century,
    Climate Only (2069), and Mid-Century, Adaptation (2069) scenarios.
  6: 'Three scenarios are simulated: present-day climate, mid-century climate with
    present-day emissions, and mid-century climate with emissions from adaptation.'
  8: The study uses the MyPower model (a load duration curve electricity dispatch
    model) to simulate plant-level electricity production and emissions. CMAQ model
    version 5.0.1 is used for air quality simulations, driven by EPA 2011 NEI anthropogenic
    emissions and MEGAN version 2.1 biogenic emissions. Simulations focus on July
    2011 conditions and use a 12km by 12km horizontal resolution over the eastern
    US with 25 vertical layers.
  9: "Uses CMAQ for air quality simulations (only July is simulated). Health impacts\
    \ assessed using EPA's BenMAP\u2013Community Edition version 1.3, using expert-derived\
    \ PM2.5 exposure\u2013response functions and O3 C-R functions used for the 2008\
    \ NAAQS evaluations. Population is held constant for 2011. A 5,000-member Monte\
    \ Carlo ensemble calculates mean impacts and associated uncertainty. Valuation\
    \ is performed to monetize the costs of exacerbated air pollution."
  10: The analysis involves calculating air-quality-related health impacts based on
    July modeling, extrapolated to summer averages, using a combination of willingness
    to pay, cost of illness, and value of statistical life methods; impacts are primarily
    calculated using BenMAP, focusing on July data as representative for summer.
  11: Compares present-day and mid-century climate scenarios, analyzing hourly temperature
    distributions and resulting emissions, assumes constant power plant inventory.
  12: Analyzed air quality in the PD (present-day climate, present-day EGU emissions),
    MCCO (mid-century climate only), and MCA (mid-century adaptation) scenarios.
  13: Comparison of a warm mid-century climate-only scenario (MCCO) to a warm mid-century
    adaptation scenario (MCA).
  14: The analysis models future climate impacts on air quality, considering both
    climate change alone and the adaptation response of increased air conditioning
    use. The results are applicable to a mid-century (MC) scenario compared to present
    day (PD). The study uses chemical transport modeling (likely CMAQ) with different
    chemical mechanisms (CB05) which can produce different results.
  16: Uses BenMAP to quantify health impacts, based on EPA-selected epidemiological
    studies and expert elicitation. Mortality calculated based on MDA8 O3 concentrations
    and maximum daily 1-hour concentrations. Annual impacts estimated as a 3-month
    summer average based on July modeling.
  17: The analysis uses concentration-response (C-R) functions from various expert
    elicitations and epidemiological studies to estimate mortality incidence and associated
    valuation. The table presents results for different climate scenarios and compares
    them.
  18: The analysis uses concentration-response (C-R) functions from various studies
    to estimate the impact of different O3 concentration scenarios on mortality. These
    functions are based on either maximum daily 1-hour O3 concentrations or MDA8 O3
    concentrations. Some studies' functions have age ranges other than 0-99 years.
  19: The analysis uses studies and statistical data to quantify mortality and morbidity
    impacts from PM2.5 and O3 exposure, but specific methods or frameworks beyond
    this aren't detailed on the page.
  21: Modeling only a single representative month from 1 year in future climate projections,
    health impacts assessment relies on C-R functions for O3 and PM2.5
  22: Uses the CMAQ model, BenMAP, and data from NARCCAP.
  23: Uses atmospheric chemistry and climate models, statistical models, empirical
    models of global soil-biogenic NOx emissions, global climate models
  24: The studies utilize various methodologies to assess the impact of climate change
    and energy demand on air quality and related health outcomes. These appear to
    include modeling and analysis of emissions data in various U.S. regions.
More Notes:
  3: The study is the first to examine future air-pollution-related health damages
    of power plant emissions driven by increased electricity demand for air conditioning
  8: The building stock is held static under both present-day and warm-climate scenarios.
    The use of the present-day building stock and power plants is not meant to be
    predictive, but to bound the potential damages of climate inaction. The study
    considers planned changes to the electricity grid and assumes power plants maintain
    resource adequacy in warm-climate scenarios.
  9: Focuses on mortality, which is not pooled as standard practice in the EPA methodology.
    Health impacts based on maximum daily 1-hour O3 are simulated but not pooled.
  11: Simulating coal plant retirements and renewable energy investments would likely
    result in lower emissions. The study focuses on interactions between climate,
    energy production, and air quality, rather than predictive accuracy.
  12: Increases in PM2.5 from the MCCO to the MCA scenario are highest (as high as
    >5%) in and downwind of the Ohio River Valley, coincident with the highest concentration
    of fossil fuel, especially coal-fired, power plants.
  13: Decrease in concentrations in the southeast is primarily due to a decrease in
    emissions in these regions associated with power plant dispatch changes.
  14: "The choice of chemical mechanism in the atmospheric model influences the impact\
    \ of biogenic emissions on PM2.5. The study focuses on changes due to building\
    \ energy use (MCCO versus MCA) for discussion. Figure 5 shows state-by-state changes\
    \ in NOx and SO\u2082 emissions."
  16: The study acknowledges limitations in comparability to NAAQS standards due to
    the use of regional average hourly concentrations and a limited sample size (July
    only).
  17: The study compares mid-century climate-only (MCCO), mid-century adaptation (MCA),
    and present-day (PD) scenarios.
  21: Study limitations include modeling only a single month and not projecting future
    changes to population, air pollution exposure patterns in humans, building stock,
    and the electric power sector.
  22: Lists author contributions to different aspects of the study including conceptualization,
    data curation, formal analysis, funding acquisition, investigation, methodology,
    project administration, software, supervision, validation, visualization, and
    writing.
  23: Focuses on the sensitivity of air quality to climate change and the influence
    of various climate-related factors on air pollutants.
