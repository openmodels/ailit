Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global warming and rapidly growing human population exacerbate the risk of land
    degradation and desertification.
  2: Drying trends are impacting global land area.
  3: Changes in aridity, specifically the expansion of drylands and changes in the
    areal coverage of different dryland subtypes (dry subhumid, semiarid, arid, and
    hyper-arid).
  4: Changes in dryland subtypes, with drying areas mainly in eastern Siberia, northeastern
    China, western Asia, central Africa, and Canada.
  5: Warming and drying trends, dryland expansion, increased vapour pressure deficit,
    decreased soil moisture, increased sensible heat flux, decreased latent heat flux,
    temperature extremes, erosion-induced land degradation.
  6: Warming trends over drylands, particularly in arid regions, are twice as great
    as those over humid regions.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Global dryland expansion rate and its areal change are evaluated.
  2: Drying trends are being evaluated using the aridity index (AI).
  3: No relevant information
  5: Gross primary production (GPP) is evaluated as a function of the aridity index
    (AI).
  6: Increased poverty, degradation of land and ecosystems, soil loss and further
    desertification.
Highlights:
  1: Drylands projected to cover half of the global land surface by the end of the
    century; increasing aridity will lead to enhanced warming and affect water scarcity
    and land degradation.
  2: CMIP5-EM simulations severely underestimate the expansion of drylands in the
    historical period.
  4: Drylands are expected to dominate the global land surface, with drier subtypes
    covering a larger area than those becoming wetter.
  5: Drylands are warming faster than humid regions and the global mean. GPP is positively
    correlated with AI. Drylands are projected to expand significantly by the end
    of the century, particularly in developing countries. Warming and drying reinforce
    each other through a positive feedback cycle affecting carbon storage and emissions.
  6: Drylands in developing countries are more sensitive to climatic and environmental
    changes as well as to human-induced perturbations compared to developed countries.
Methodology:
  1: Bias-correction of CMIP5 projections using historical data to account for main
    trends and correct projections.
  2: The analysis compares observed data (1948-2005) with CMIP5-EM historical simulations.
  3: The analysis uses CPC observations and CMIP5-EM projections (historical, RCP8.5,
    and RCP4.5), with corrections applied to the CMIP5-EM data. Seven-year running
    means are used to emphasize aridity trends. Future period is divided into three
    30-year intervals to study the temporal evolution of the drylands.
  5: Analysis is based on CRU observations and CMIP5-EM simulations for temperature
    trends (1948-2005). GPP is analyzed regionally from 2000 to 2010.
  7: Uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of CMIP5
    and observed datasets. Regression is used to establish a relationship between
    CMIP5 PCs and observed PCs, which is then used to correct CMIP5 projections. A
    leave-one-out cross-validation is conducted to choose the cumulative number of
    leading PCs.
More Notes:
  2: The corrected CMIP5-EM simulations more closely align with observations compared
    to the original CMIP5-EM.  There is quantitative information of the percentage
    change of global land area undergoing subtype changes.
  3: No relevant information
  5: CMIP5 models cannot fully reproduce the warming and drying pattern due to the
    absence of global carbon cycle processes in some models.
  6: The correction method suggests that the drylands will acceleratingly expand and
    the situation may be worse, especially in developing countries.
  7: "The study uses a correction method to adjust climate model simulations to have\
    \ the same climatology of 1961\u20131990 as the observations. The method's validity\
    \ is verified by a posteriori independent validation."
Quantitative material:
  1: Projected dryland area increase of 23% under RCP8.5 and 11% under RCP4.5; observed
    AI decreased with a net trend of -0.050 per 58 years; CMIP5-EM showed a mean trend
    of -0.012 per 58 years.
  2: The observed data shows 66% of global land area with a drying trend during 1948-2005,
    while CMIP5-EM simulation shows 59%.
  3: "The corrected area coverage is 56% of the global land area in 2100 under RCP8.5,\
    \ which is 23% larger relative to observed climatology (1961\u20131990). Under\
    \ RCP4.5, the total coverage is 50%. Dryland subtypes' proportions are specified\
    \ for both scenarios."
  4: 78% of increased drylands occur in developing countries.
  5: "Average temperature increase in drylands is 1.17 \xB0C per 58 years, approximately\
    \ 2.1 and 1.5 times greater than the increase in humid regions and in the global\
    \ mean, respectively. GPP in arid regions is approximately one-fifth of that in\
    \ humid regions. Drylands will expand by 23% and 11% relative to the 1961\u2013\
    1990 baseline under RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 by the end of the twenty-first century.\
    \ Newly expanded dryland areas, 78% will be located in developing countries."
  6: By 2025, drylands may occupy 48% of the global land surface and sustain 51% of
    the global population growth from 2000 to 2025, 50% of which will occur in developing
    countries, compared with only 1% in developed countries.
