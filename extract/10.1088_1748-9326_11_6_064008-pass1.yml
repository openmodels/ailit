Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature and precipitation (climate change), population pressure
  3: "Temperature anomaly (\xB0C), precipitation anomaly (mm), population size (million);\
    \ agrarian economy stress."
  4: Temperature anomaly, precipitation anomaly (climate change).
  5: Temperature, precipitation, population
  6: Climate change (temperature more influential than precipitation), population
    pressure.
  7: Temperature, precipitation, population, social crisis (rebellion and invasion)
  8: Climate change impact and population's role; larger population increases such
    vulnerabilities by decreasing the economic growth potential; population pressure
    emanates from the size and role of the population.

Highlights:
  1: Climate change induces economic fluctuations in late imperial China, particularly
    in the long term; Temperature has a greater influence on the economy than precipitation;
    Population primarily acts as consumers in the long term; Economic vulnerability
    in late imperial China under climate change is higher than that in early modern
    Europe; Late imperial Chinese society has a high economic vulnerability to climate
    change.
  2: The study quantitatively analyzes the climate change-economy relationship of
    imperial China at the macroscale and measures the influence of climate change
    and population pressure on the economy. It compares late imperial China and early
    modern Europe to evaluate similarities and differences of economic fluctuations
    across Eurasia under climate change.
  3: The study examines the relationships between climate variables (temperature and
    precipitation), economic indicators (GDP per capita and rice price), and population
    size.
  4: The study aims to statistically examine the association between climate change
    and the vulnerability of Chinese agrarian economy.
  5: Higher temperature and more rainfall are associated with increased real GDP per
    capita. A larger population size is associated with decreased real GDP per capita.
    Warmer climate is associated with decreased rice prices. Larger population size
    is associated with increased rice prices. Temperature Granger-causes both real
    GDP per capita and rice price.
  6: Climate change dominates real GDP per capita and rice price in late imperial
    China, particularly in the long term. Temperature has a greater influence than
    precipitation. Population acts mainly as a consumer, negatively affecting the
    economy in the long term.
  7: Social crisis (rebellion and invasion) has a statistically significant negative
    impact on the national economy (real GDP per capita).
  8: Size and role of the population must be considered when examining socioeconomic
    vulnerability to climate change.

Methodology:
  1: "Quantitative analysis of the relationship between climate change and the economy\
    \ in late imperial China (AD 1600\u20131840) at the national level using multivariate\
    \ regression and Granger causality analyses; Comparison of findings with those\
    \ in early modern Europe."
  2: Multivariate regression analysis and Granger causality analysis (GCA) are used
    to analyze the relationships between climate change, agrarian economy, and population
    pressure. Prais-Winsten estimation is used to address autoregressive disturbances
    and flexible time trends. A low-pass filter technique (Butterworth filter with
    a 40-year window) is applied to estimate trends from time series data.
  3: Quantitative analysis within different temporal scales is used to identify the
    impact of temperature and precipitation anomalies on the agrarian economy; raw
    data is low-pass filtered using a 40-year filter.
  4: The study statistically examines the association between climate change and the
    vulnerability of the Chinese agrarian economy at the national and long-term scales.
    The data used is smoothed before the analysis, but supplementary information includes
    results using raw data and robustness tests.
  5: Regression analysis and Granger causality analysis (GCA) are performed on low-pass
    filtered data. Regression analysis establishes correlations, while GCA tests for
    causal relationships between climate variables (temperature, precipitation), population,
    and economic outcomes (real GDP per capita, rice price). The analysis pertains
    to historical China.
  6: "Regression analysis and Granger Causality Analysis (GCA). Applicable to late\
    \ imperial China (AD 1600\u20131840) and compared with early modern Europe (AD\
    \ 1500\u20131800)."
  7: "Multivariate regression using low-pass filtered data from late imperial China\
    \ (Ming and Qing dynasties), including a crisis dummy variable for the period\
    \ AD 1643\u20131662."
  8: Implemented at a large spatial and long-term scale; analysis is aiming to open
    a new routine to understand such phenomena under impact of climate change.

More Notes:
  1: "The study revisits Malthusian and \u2018Great Divergence\u2019 theories by including\
    \ the perspective of economic vulnerability under climate change."
  2: The study focuses on late imperial China (AD 1600-1840). It uses statistical
    analysis to establish a relationship between climate change and the long-term,
    large-scale agrarian economy.
  3: Data reliability is guaranteed by using data published in international refereed
    journals or confirmed by scholars.
  4: The analysis excludes social organization, arguing its influence on the economy
    is less important than climate change in the long term and in large-scale scenarios.
    The study covers the period AD 1600-1840.
  5: The paper finds a stronger link between temperature and the agrarian economy
    than between population and the agrarian economy in late imperial China. The adjusted
    R-squared for the real GDP per capita regression is 0.934, and for the rice price
    regression, it is 0.799.
  6: The paper suggests that unsustainable population pressure negatively affected
    the economy of historical China. Europe had a higher buffering capacity than China.
  7: The study compares the climate change-economy relationship in late imperial China
    with early modern Europe.
  8: "The study clarifies it provides understanding on climate change and China\u2019\
    s economy from the paradigm of climate history."

  1: Real GDP per capita, rice price
  3: Real GDP per capita (silver per tael), rice price index (gams of silver).
  4: Real GDP per capita (as an indicator of macroeconomic well-being and economic
    performance), rice price index (as indicator of economic well-being).
  5: Real GDP per capita, rice price
  6: Real GDP per capita impacted by climate change.
  7: Real GDP per capita
  8: Detecting economic vulnerabilities is the first step in adapting to climate change;
    level of vulnerabilities in one country or region may differ from those of others,
    and even within a country.
