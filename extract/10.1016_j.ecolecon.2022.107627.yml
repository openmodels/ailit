Highlights:
  2: 4-5 week dry spells during the hottest part of the year depress growth in crop
    production; the effects are modified by drought, aridity, and heat waves; losses
    are concentrated in areas not equipped for irrigation.
  5: Dry spells should lower growth in crop production, with effects that are larger
    in magnitude when dry spells co-occur with heat waves, drought, or aridity. Irrigation
    availability moderates the effects of dry spells on growth in crop production.
  11: Negative correlation between growth in the FAO CPI and dry spell days is significant
    in more arid countries and in countries experiencing drier years. Correlation
    remains negative but smaller and not statistically different from zero in less
    arid countries and wetter years.
  12: The primary interest is in understanding the direct effect of dry spells on
    growth in the FAO CPI. Evidence suggests these direct effects are transitory.
  13: The paper leverages within-country differences to assess the impact of simultaneous
    dry spells and heat waves, including interactions with drought and aridity.
  14: Irrigation may dampen the impact of dry spells, but the difference in outcomes
    between irrigated and non-irrigated areas may not directly reflect the benefits
    of irrigation due to confounding factors like different farming practices. Focusing
    on cereal yield growth and weighting environmental variables by cereal crop area
    or production may provide a better estimate of the dry-spell-mitigating effects
    of irrigation.
  16: Dry spells of at least 28 days have significant negative effects on crop production
    growth.
  17: Dry spells directly reduce growth in the FAO CPI, with negligible indirect effects
    through their contribution to drought.
  18: The main finding is that longer dry spells have negative effects on growth in
    crop production. This effect appears robust to various changes in model specification.
  19: Dry spell days are less damaging in years with heat waves, but a compounding
    effect of joint exposure is only observed for very long heat waves (12+ days),
    and broader definitions of dry spells result in smaller estimates of damage
  20: Dry spells are damaging primarily in countries with an aggregate annual water
    deficit and areas with less irrigation.
  21: Dry spells are more damaging in locations experiencing annual water deficits
    or aridity. Dry spells appear less harmful when occurring during the same year
    as heat wave days. Dry spells are less damaging in areas more equipped for irrigation.
  35: "Dry spell exposure is negatively correlated with crop production growth. The\
    \ negative correlation is stronger under drought conditions (SPEI \u2264 0) and\
    \ in areas with lower aridity indices."
  36: Heat waves have a statistically significant and negative impact on the growth
    in FAO CPI. Drought (SPEI) has a statistically significant and positive impact
    on the growth in FAO CPI. The length of dry spells has a negative impact on growth
    in FAO CPI.
  37: Dry spell and heat wave days negatively impact outcomes individually, but their
    interaction can mitigate some negative effects in certain scenarios.
  38: The impact of dry spells on CPI is significantly more negative in more arid
    and drought-prone areas. Irrigation may lessen the impact of dry spells on CPI
    but that result is statistically insignificant.  The impact of dry spells on cereal
    yields is less negative in more irrigated areas, although this result is only
    statistically significant when using cereal production weights to aggregate to
    the country level.
  39: The analysis focuses on understanding the impact of dry spells and heat waves
    on GDP, considering the role of drought and aridity as moderators.
  41: An additional dry spell day has increasingly negative marginal effects depending
    on the minimum durations of heat waves and dry spells, with significance increasing
    to p<0.01 as durations extend.
  42: Current year dry spell days have a statistically significant negative impact
    on the outcome. The sum of the dry spell coefficients is not statistically different
    from zero in any model, suggesting no long-term growth effect.
  43: Dry spells have a statistically significant negative impact on the value added
    per capita in agriculture, fisheries, and forestry.
  44: Longer minimum dry spell durations (21, 28, and 35+ days) have statistically
    significant negative impacts. The controlled direct effect of an additional dry
    spell day is negative, suggesting a detrimental impact associated with increased
    dry spell duration.
  46: Dry spells have statistically significant effects (positive or negative) on
    unspecified macroeconomic/fiscal outcomes depending on aridity and drought conditions,
    as indicated by the significant coefficients on dry spell days in Table A6.
Methodology:
  2: Uses a global panel dataset of daily precipitation and temperature to investigate
    the impact of dry spells on crop production, considering drought, aridity, and
    heat waves as modifying factors.
  5: Statistical approach isolates country-specific dry spell exposure anomalies,
    and the range of specifications we estimate allow us to probe relationships between
    and joint effects of water and heat stress across timescales.
  6: Uses daily precipitation totals from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) spanning
    1979 to 2016, gridded to 0.5-degree latitude.
  9: The analysis uses data on water stress, temperature, precipitation, aridity,
    and irrigation. Drought is measured using SPEI. Aridity is based on the FAO's
    aridity index. Irrigation data is from FAO's AQUASTAT database. National-scale
    variables are constructed using spatial weighting. Considers both a 12-month SPEI
    and a start-of-season SPEI.
  10: Regression analysis adjusting for lagged log of agricultural value added per
    capita. Includes countries based on data quality (excludes Sub-Saharan Africa).
    Uses arid and less arid groupings based on median aridity index. Accounts for
    prevailing climate regimes, trends, and droughts.
  11: Fixed effects models relating growth in the FAO CPI in a country and year to
    dry spell exposure.
  12: The analysis uses a linear regression model (equation 1) with country fixed
    effects and year effects, adjusting for covariates including average temperature
    and its square, total precipitation and its square, and country-specific quadratic
    time trends. Distributed lag variants of the model are also estimated.
  13: The analysis is performed by estimating a model with terms capturing exposure
    to dry spells and heat waves, both separately and in combination, as well as variations
    considering drought and aridity within-country.
  14: Regression analysis is performed at the country scale examining the impact of
    dry spells and heat waves on growth. The analysis is then refined to examine the
    role of irrigation by comparing outcomes in more and less irrigated areas. Further
    refinement involves focusing on cereal yield growth and weighting environmental
    variables by cereal crop area or average cereal production.
  15: Ordinary least squares with country and year fixed effects (demeaning or 'within'
    estimator); clustered standard errors at the country level; sequential g-estimation
    as a robustness check to address drought as a mediator between dry spells and
    crop production; bootstrapping at the panel unit level for inference in the g-estimation.
  16: Uses a series of alternative specifications to examine the robustness of dry
    spell estimates. These include adjusting for lagged agricultural output, lagged
    dry spell/heat wave effects, using cubic and quartic terms for temperature and
    precipitation, employing counts of days in temperature bins, using linear and
    cubic per-country time trends, weighting dry spell exposure by fraction of cropped
    grid cell, and using SPEI. They also use sequential g-estimation.
  17: The analysis assumes additively separable effects of dry spells and uses a baseline
    model conditioned on drought, adjusting for annual precipitation.
  18: The analysis uses equation (2) to estimate the effects of dry spells, varying
    with exposure to heat waves. Robustness checks are performed with various alternative
    covariates and an alternate outcome. Sequential g-estimation is used to account
    for the potential influence of dry spells on drought, focusing estimation on a
    controlled direct effect of dry spells.
  19: Regression analysis of the effects of dry spells and heat waves on crop production,
    using different definitions of dry spells (hottest 90 days vs. hottest 120 days
    or full year) and incorporating cropped area weights.
  20: Analysis is performed using spatial averaging, comparing cross-country variation
    in national aridity or drought; sequential g-estimation is used to examine variations
    in effects based on drought levels; effects of dry spells on cereal yields are
    analyzed.
  21: Observational study examining the relationship between dry spell exposure and
    crop production at a national scale.
  35: Panel data analysis using within-country demeaned FAO CPI growth rates and within-country
    demeaned dry spell days. Panel bootstrap with 1000 replicates used to compute
    confidence intervals.
  36: The analysis estimates the effects of explanatory variables in equation (1),
    omitting fixed effects, year effects, and trends. Standard errors are clustered
    at the country level. The model examines the impact of dry spells of varying durations
    (7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days) on growth in FAO CPI.
  37: Analysis is based on Equation (2), estimating effects of dry spell days, heat
    wave days, their interaction, and joint occurrences of dry spells and heat waves,
    with clustering at the country level.
  38: The analysis uses regressions (equations 3, 4, and 5) to estimate the impact
    of dry spells on CPI and cereal yield, allowing for heterogeneity based on aridity,
    drought, and irrigation. Standard errors are clustered at the country level. The
    results are applicable to countries with varying levels of aridity, drought, and
    irrigation.
  39: Distributed lag models (up to 5 lags) and split-sample/interaction term regressions
    are used to analyze the effects of dry spells, heatwaves, and drought on GDP.
    These models account for country-specific fixed effects, time fixed effects and
    controls for temperature and precipitation. The interaction term regressions are
    applicable when examining how the effects of dry spells and heat waves depend
    upon country-level drought and aridity.
  40: The analysis applies sequential g-estimation to a model with interactions between
    dry spell exposure and drought. A demediation step removes estimates of terms
    involving drought to estimate the direct effects of dry spells at different levels
    of the SPEI (D0). The SPEI, or Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index,
    is recentered around target levels (D0).
  41: Estimates are derived using Equation (1) in the main text, with standard errors
    clustered at the country level.
  42: Distributed lag model estimation. Variants of equation (1) with lagged environmental
    variables (dry spell days, heat wave days, drought, temperature, precipitation,
    and their squares). Standard errors are clustered at the country level.
  43: Panel regression with standard errors clustered at the country level. The models
    adjust for temporal weighting of dry spell and heat wave measures using cropped
    area by month, SPEI, temperature bins, cubic/quartic precipitation and temperature
    terms, per-country trends, lagged environmental variables, and lagged value added
    per capita in agriculture.
  44: Sequential g-estimation to account for the potential influence of dry spells
    on the 12-month SPEI in a given year.
  45: Estimates derived using variants of a specific equation for 28+ day dry spells
    and 9+ day heat waves using different subsets of days; standard errors clustered
    at country level.
  46: Split-sample and interaction term models are used to estimate the effect of
    dry spell days on unspecified macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, conditional on
    country-level aridity (above/below median) and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration
    Index, <=0 or >0).
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on punctuated events and multiple stressors, complementing
    previous studies that focused on longer-term phenomena or isolated extremes.
  5: The outcome of interest, 'growth in aggregate crop production,' is not a macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcome, but it can inform downstream macroeconomic analyses. The paper
    uses the FAO Crop Production Index (FAO CPI) as a metric.
  6: The 'number of dry spell days' variable is sensitive to the number of days that
    a dry spell persists beyond a minimum duration and reflects the occurrence of
    multiple dry spells during the year.
  9: The paper uses data at a high spatial resolution (5-10 arc-minutes) and aggregates
    it to the national level using spatial weighting. The paper explores the effects
    of irrigation by partitioning cells based on whether the fraction of cropland
    equipped for irrigation is above or below the median.
  10: The analysis focuses on the effects of punctuated weather events.
  11: The study investigates whether water stress at different timescales has compounding
    effects.
  12: The model explores interactive effects of dry spells and heat waves in subsequent
    analyses.
  14: "The study attempts to isolate the impact of irrigation on mitigating dry spells\
    \ by focusing on cereal yield growth and adjusting spatial aggregation weights.\
    \ The model specification includes country fixed effects (\u03BC) and time fixed\
    \ effects (\u03C6)."
  15: The paper is concerned about drought being a mediator between dry spells and
    CPI growth and uses g-estimation to address potential confounding.
  16: The study focuses on agricultural outcomes, which may have implications for
    broader macroeconomic and fiscal outcomes, but this connection is not explicitly
    explored on this page.
  17: Effects of shorter minimum spell durations in defining dry spells are negative
    but not statistically significant.
  19: The analysis suggests that high temperatures (including heat waves) exacerbate
    the effects of dry spells on crop production, even if the evidence for a compounding
    effect is weak.
  21: The relationship between irrigation and dry spell impacts is suggestive of adaptation,
    but not necessarily causal.
  35: The analysis focuses on 28+ day dry spells. The aridity index median is 0.997.
  36: 'The table shows the estimated direct effect on growth in FAO CPI of having
    an additional day in a dry spell, when dry spells must last at least the number
    of days specified in each column header. Significance levels are indicated as
    follows: ***: p<0.01, **: p<0.05, *: p<0.1.'
  38: Thresholds for aridity, drought, and irrigation are used to differentiate between
    'less' and 'more' conditions. The analysis focuses on dry spells of 28+ days and
    heat waves of 9+ days.
  39: The appendix provides details on the specifications used in other analyses presented
    in the main text, particularly regarding distributed lag models and country-level
    heterogeneity.
  42: The estimates reflect the effect of an additional dry spell day in a specification
    with 28+ day dry spells and 9+ day heat waves. Columns (1)-(5) successively introduce
    additional lags.
  43: The table presents robustness checks of the baseline results by modifying the
    original model specification. The number of observations varies across specifications,
    ranging from 3153 to 4072.
  44: The dependent variable for the reported estimate is not specified, which is
    a significant limitation for understanding the effect size and economic implications.
  46: The number of heat wave days is also included in each specification.
