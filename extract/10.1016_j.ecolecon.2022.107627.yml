Highlights:
  2: The study finds that dry spells during the hottest part of the year depress crop
    production, particularly in areas not equipped for irrigation, indicating a potential
    role for adaptation.
  3: Dry spells are likely harmful to crops; understanding the impacts of dry spells
    on agriculture is only likely to grow in importance. Dry spell occurrence is linked
    to climate change and may contribute to flash droughts.
  7: Considers variations like dry spells during hottest 120 days or year-round, and
    contributions of crop area weightings including those for cereal crops.
  9: Compares exposure in more irrigated areas to exposure in less irrigated areas
    by partitioning cells based on whether the fraction of cropland within a cell
    that is equipped for irrigation is above or below the median fraction among all
    cells with any area equipped for irrigation.
  10: Exposure to dry spells, heat waves, and drought conditions is changing through
    time. Heat wave days and dry spell days differ substantially between arid and
    less arid countries. Drought incidence increases with dry spell days, especially
    in arid countries.
  11: A significant negative correlation between growth in the FAO CPI and dry spell
    days is observed in more arid countries and in countries experiencing drier years.
    The sign of the differences in correlation across subsamples is consistent with
    water stress at different timescales having compounding effects.
  12: The primary interest is in capturing the direct effect of dry spells on food
    production growth.
  13: The analysis aims to capture the differential effect of combined exposure to
    dry spells and heat waves compared to either stressor occurring in isolation,
    as well as the additional impact of simultaneous exposure to both stressors. It
    also captures exposure to dry spells and heat waves in areas with varying levels
    of drought or aridity.
  14: "The difference between the coefficients on dry spell days for more irrigated\
    \ areas and less irrigated areas (\U0001D703_1^(\U0001D440\U0001D43C) and \U0001D703\
    _1^(\U0001D43F\U0001D43C)) is unlikely to reflect the benefits of irrigation in\
    \ reducing the impacts of dry spells, due to potentially confounding farming practices."
  15: Sequential g-estimation avoids bias in the estimation of the effect of dry spells
    on CPI growth if the relationship between drought and CPI growth is confounded
    by omitted variables.
  16: Dry spells of at least 28 days have significant negative effects on crop production.
  17: Dry spells have a direct negative impact on agricultural commodity price growth.
  18: Main results hold across a range of robustness checks. Negative main effects
    of an additional day in a 28+ day dry spell on growth in crop production.
  19: Dry spell days are less damaging when heat waves occur during the same year.
    Compounding effect of joint exposure to dry spells and heat waves is only observed
    for 12+ day heat waves. High temperatures may exacerbate the effects of dry spells
    on growth in crop production.
  20: Dry spells are primarily damaging in countries and years with an aggregate annual
    water deficit. Dry spells are damaging in cells with less area equipped for irrigation
    (after modifying specification). Irrigation may lower probability of crop loss
    but losses in irrigated areas could have larger effects on the FAO CPI. Dry spell
    effects on cereal yields become larger in irrigated areas.
  21: Dry spells are significantly more damaging when they occur in locations experiencing
    annual water deficits or that are arid. Dry spells appear less harmful when occurring
    during the same year as heat waves. Dry spells are less damaging in areas more
    equipped for irrigation, after narrowing in on a comparable set of crops and baseline
    productivity levels.
  22: Short-term water stress (dry spells) is more damaging when longer-term water
    stress (drought or aridity) is present; Absence of an interactive effect of dry
    spell days and heat wave days when they occur simultaneously.
  23: Non-additive effects of heat and water stress on crops are found primarily when
    dry spells and heat waves occur in the same year. The country scale of the analysis
    combined with the rarity of heat waves and dry spells may limit the ability to
    detect joint exposure effects.
  24: The statistical models assume an equivalence in impact among changes in the
    number, duration, and fraction of crop area affected by dry spells, which may
    not hold in practice. Irrigation has a smaller impact on dry spells in irrigated
    areas, but the data on irrigation is static (only areas equipped for irrigation
    are considered).
  25: Effects of hot, dry weather could be mitigated through nutrient management.
  28: Several studies focus on drought impacts on US maize yields and global crop
    production, including changes in sensitivity over time.
  33: The plots aim to illustrate changes in the relationship between dry spell days,
    heatwave occurrences, and drought indices over time, highlighting any differences
    between less and more arid countries in 1979 and 2016.
  34: Provides descriptive statistics for climate variables that could be useful for
    understanding climate exposure.
  35: "Dry spell exposure is negatively correlated with crop production growth. The\
    \ negative correlation is stronger under drought conditions (SPEI \u2264 0) and\
    \ in more arid regions (Aridity Index below median)."
  36: Significant negative impact on growth in FAO CPI from additional heat wave days
    and some categories of dry spells.
  37: The effects of dry spell days and heat wave days, as well as their interaction,
    are statistically significant in many of the specifications. The magnitude and
    significance of the effects vary depending on the duration of the heat wave and
    whether a joint exposure term is included.
  38: Dry spells have different impacts on CPI depending on aridity and drought levels,
    and on cereal yield depending on irrigation levels. In more arid and drought-prone
    areas, dry spells have a more negative impact on CPI. In areas with more irrigation,
    dry spells have a positive impact on cereal yield. The difference between the
    estimated effects of a dry spell day in cells having moderator values above vs.
    below the key moderator threshold is reported.
  39: The analysis examines how the effects of dry spells depend upon drought and
    aridity using country-level variation in those moderators.
  40: The analysis aims to estimate the direct effects of dry spells (DS) on the outcome
    (G) while accounting for drought (D) using a sequential g-estimation approach.
  41: The estimated marginal effects are generally negative, suggesting an additional
    dry spell day has a negative impact on the outcome. The magnitude of the effect
    increases with longer dry spell durations and, to some extent, longer heat wave
    durations. Some estimates are statistically significant at the 0.05 and 0.01 levels.
  42: Current year dry spell days have a statistically significant negative impact
    (p<0.05) on the outcome variable in all model specifications. One-year lagged
    dry spell days have a statistically significant positive impact in some models
    (p<0.1 or p<0.05). The p-value for the test of the null hypothesis that the sum
    of the dry spell coefficients is zero is generally high (above 0.27), suggesting
    a limited growth effect of dry spells.
  43: An additional dry spell day is generally associated with a negative effect on
    value added per capita in agriculture, fisheries, and forestry.  The magnitude
    and significance of this effect varies depending on the model specification.
  44: Statistically significant negative effects are observed for dry spells lasting
    21, 28, and 35 days, with p-values indicating significance at the 0.05 level.
  45: 'Focusing on the hottest 90 or 120 days of the year shows a negative relationship
    between dry spell days and growth in the FAO CPI, compared to including all days
    of the year. The study considers both unweighted and crop-area-weighted values
    to see if the hottest period for crops is important. '
  46: "Dry spells have statistically significant effects (p < 0.05) in below median\
    \ aridity regions and regions experiencing drought (SPEI \u2264 0). The effects\
    \ differ depending on whether split-sample estimation or interaction terms are\
    \ used."
Methodology:
  1: Multi-stressor and multi-timescale analysis
  2: The analysis uses a global panel of daily precipitation and temperature data
    from 1979 to 2016, integrating a multi-timescale and multi-stressor perspective.
  3: The paper emphasizes the need to account for simultaneously co-occurring stressors
    when understanding the effects of dry spells on agriculture. It also notes that
    studies often restrict attention to the duration of the longest dry spell, which
    may miss important aspects of exposure.
  6: The analysis uses an index of net crop production relative to 2014-2016 averages
    and incorporates international pricing from the same period to isolate the impact
    of dry spells; it defines dry spells by the number of consecutive abnormally dry
    days preceded by at least j-1 others; evaluates index sensitivity to j=7, 14,
    21, 28, 35 days; operationalizes using daily precipitation data from CPC spanning
    1979 to 2015.
  7: Analysis counts dry spell days per grid cell using abnormally dry day thresholds;
    output is a spatially weighted average count per country based on cropland as
    defined by the EARTHSTAT dataset.
  8: The study constructs separate variables for drought (using SPEI), aridity (using
    an aridity index threshold of 0.65), and joint exposure across differing environmental
    conditions.
  9: Data assembled on water stress, average temperature, annual precipitation, aridity,
    and irrigation. SPEI calculated as locally-standardized difference between monthly
    precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Aridity is the ratio of precipitation
    and average annual potential evapotranspiration. Irrigation data from FAO's AQUASTAT
    database. When required at a national scale, they construct national weighted
    exposure using the same spatial weighting scheme as for the dry spell variable.
  10: Panel data econometrics, controlling for lagged agricultural value added per
    capita. The analysis excludes Sub-Saharan Africa due to data concerns. They account
    for prevailing climate regimes, trends, and droughts when attempting to isolate
    the effects of punctuated weather events.
  11: "Fixed effects models relating growth in the FAO CPI in a country and year to\
    \ dry spell exposure. Subsamples were created based on aridity index (above/below\
    \ median) and SPEI (\u2264 0 / > 0)."
  12: Regression analysis with country and year fixed effects and additional covariates
    (temperature, precipitation, time trends). Distributed lag models are used to
    examine the persistence of dry spell effects.
  13: The analysis uses regression models (equations 2, 3, and 4) to assess the impact
    of dry spells, heat waves, drought, and aridity. It also splits the sample based
    on country-level drought and aridity and estimates the baseline model separately
    for each sub-sample (mentioned as being performed in the Appendix). The equations
    leverage within-country differences in drought and aridity exposure.
  14: The study uses a model (equation 5) to quantify dry spell days and heat wave
    days for cells in a country classified as more irrigated (MI) or less irrigated
    (LI). It also uses spatial aggregation weights for environmental variables to
    pertain to cereal crops, using both the area of a grid cell devoted to cereal
    crops and the average production of cereal crops in a grid cell for weighting.
  15: 'Ordinary least squares regression with country and year fixed effects (demeaning)
    is used. Clustered standard errors account for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity
    at the country level. Sequential g-estimation is used in robustness checks to
    estimate controlled direct effects in the presence of a mediating variable (drought).
    This involves a two-stage process: estimating the mediator''s contribution (drought)
    to the outcome, then subtracting the estimated mediator effect from the dependent
    variable and estimating the direct effect of dry spells on the demediated outcome.'
  16: The study uses alternative specifications to examine the robustness of dry spell
    estimates, including adjustments for lagged variables, flexible temperature and
    precipitation effects, alternative time trends, weighted dry spell exposure based
    on crop fraction, and SPEI.
  17: Regression models that adjust for annual precipitation. Baseline results use
    heat waves of at least 9 days.
  18: Regression analysis (equation 2), sequential g-estimation.
  19: Regression analysis, allowing dry spells to occur in the hottest 90 days, 120
    days, or full year with and without monthly cropped area weights.
  20: "Uses grid cell data, examines cross-country variation in national aridity/drought\
    \ (spatial averaging), sequential g-estimation, and focuses on specific crops\
    \ for cereal yield analysis. Findings are applicable to areas experiencing a water\
    \ deficit (12-month SPEI \u2264 0) or that are more arid (aridity index > 0.65)."
  21: The study estimates the effect of dry spells on crop production, considering
    factors like water deficits, aridity, heat waves, and irrigation. The analysis
    refines the role that irrigation may play by reweighting dry spell exposure by
    average cereal productivity.
  23: Analysis based on globally gridded temperature and precipitation data; analysis
    enforces a single threshold and minimum duration for each stressor.
  24: Statistical models are used to assess the impact of dry spell exposure on crop
    outcomes, considering the number, duration, and fraction of crop area affected
    by dry spells.
  28: Analysis using SPI and SPEI in Sichuan Province, China (Liu et al., 2021); Continental,
    integrated analysis for Europe (Lehner et al., 2006).
  31: 'Analysis of dry spell frequencies and their variability over southern Africa;
    Multi-scalar drought index sensitive to global warming: The Standardized Precipitation
    Evapotranspiration Index - SPEI; spatiotemporal patterns and historical changes
    of drought effects on US maize and soybean production'
  33: Scatter plots are used to compare the relationship between heat stress and water
    stress at three timescales at the beginning (1979) and end (2016) of the sample.
    Countries are separated based on whether their aridity index is below (red) or
    above (blue) the median country-level aridity index.
  34: Summary statistics are calculated at the observation level for all variables,
    whether or not it is time-invariant for a given country (aridity, irrigation).
  35: "Panel bootstrap with 1000 replicates to compute confidence intervals of correlations\
    \ between within-country demeaned FAO CPI growth rates and within-country demeaned\
    \ dry spell days (28+ day dry spells). Correlations are calculated for full sample,\
    \ drought conditions (SPEI \u2264 0 vs. SPEI > 0), and aridity conditions (Aridity\
    \ Index below vs. above median). Country-level median aridity index is 0.997."
  36: Uses equations omitting fixed effects, year effects, and trends, with standard
    errors clustered at the country level.
  38: 'Estimates effects of dry spells varying with aridity, drought, or irrigation,
    using equations (3), (4), and (5) respectively. Uses thresholds for aridity index
    (0.65), SPEI (0), and median irrigation area. Standard errors are clustered at
    the country level. Significance levels are indicated: ***: p<0.01, **: p<0.05,
    *: p<0.1.'
  39: Distributed lag models (Equation A1) with up to 5 lags of environmental variables.
    Split-sample and interaction-term regressions (Equation A2) to examine how dry
    spell effects depend on drought and aridity. Fixed effects for i and t.
  40: Sequential g-estimation is applied to model (A3) to assess the direct effects
    of dry spells, controlling for drought. A demediation step (A4) removes the effects
    of drought, recentering SPEI values around target levels (D0) to estimate the
    controlled direct effect of dry spells.
  41: 'The analysis uses "Equation (1) in the main text" to estimate the effect of
    an additional dry spell day. Standard errors are clustered at the country level.
    Statistical significance is indicated by asterisks: *: p<0.1, **: p<0.05, ***:
    p<0.01.'
  42: A distributed lag model is used, with dry spell days (as well as heatwave days,
    drought, temperature, precipitation, and their squares) included as current-year
    and lagged variables. Standard errors are clustered at the country level. The
    analysis uses variants of equation (1) from the main text and considers dry spells
    of 28+ days and heat waves of 9+ days.
  43: Regression analysis (variants of a baseline specification) is performed with
    standard errors clustered at the country level. The models adjust for cropped
    area by month, SPEI, temperature bins, cubic/quartic precipitation/temperature
    terms, per-country trends, lagged environmental variables, and lagged value added
    per capita. Some models instrument for lagged value added per capita using lagged
    GDP per capita.
  44: The analysis uses sequential g-estimation to account for the influence of dry
    spells on the 12-month SPEI in a given year, estimating controlled direct effects
    through panel bootstrap.
  45: Variants of equation (1) are used to estimate the effect of an additional dry
    spell day on growth in the FAO CPI. Dry spell and heat wave variables are constructed
    using different subsets of days in the year (hottest 90 days, hottest 120 days,
    and all days). Days are weighted temporally by the cropped area in a cell in the
    month when a dry spell occurs. Standard errors are clustered at the country level.
  46: 'The analysis uses split-sample estimation and interaction terms to examine
    the heterogeneous effects of dry spells based on country-level aridity and SPEI
    (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index). Two approaches are used:
    one where all covariates differ by subsample, and one where only the effects of
    dry spells differ across groups. The aridity split is based on the median country
    value of the aridity index (0.997).'
More Notes:
  4: The document indicates little is known about short-term exposure to joint water
    and heat stress on agricultural output and suggests a need for comprehensive analysis.
  7: Weighted counts of dry spell days are adjusted to approximate crop exposure using
    crop area, with a focus on historically hottest days for identifying dry spells.
  9: No relevant information
  10: "They use the CPC dataset and the World Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators."
  11: Suggestive relationships between exposure to dry spells and growth in crop production
    are noted.
  12: The paper explores potential interactive effects of dry spells and heat waves,
    and examines the persistence of dry spell impacts.
  13: The variables MD, LD, MA, and LA represent more drought-stricken, less drought-stricken,
    more arid, and less arid cells within each country, respectively. The Appendix
    contains additional analysis (Table A4) using country-level drought and aridity
    variables.
  14: 'The analysis focuses on the country scale to avoid confounding from other factors
    that correlate with drought and aridity at the country scale. The study considers
    two weighting schemes for cereal crops: area and average production.'
  15: The bootstrapping procedure is used in the second stage of g-estimation for
    inference, accounting for potential clustering.
  16: The study explores dry spell durations ranging from 7 to 35 days, with negative
    point estimates for all durations.
  21: The authors note that the relationship between irrigation and reduced damage
    from dry spells is not necessarily causal.
  23: The analysis is limited by the use of gridded data which may not accurately
    reflect farm-level conditions. The study suggests that heat may play an important
    role in the dry spell estimates.
  24: The analysis is preliminary and focuses on the extensive margin of irrigation.
    Better-resolved outcomes (crop-specific, finer spatial resolution, sub-annual
    measures) could improve results, but at the expense of external validity. The
    endogeneity of irrigation use presents statistical challenges for identifying
    its effects.
  25: Notes that surface and groundwater constraints will limit irrigation as an adaptation
    tool. Mentions that the widespread effectiveness of nutrient management adaptations
    remains to be seen.
  33: The point size indicates the number of heat wave days, suggesting this metric
    is being used as an indicator of heat stress.
  34: No relevant information
  35: The reported correlations are between demeaned (within-country) variables.
  37: Pairs of columns represent different minimum durations used to define heat waves.
    The first column in each pair imposes a constraint on the joint dry spell and
    heat wave exposure term, while the second column estimates it. The number of observations
    is 4072 in all specifications.
  38: The analysis distinguishes between crop area and cereal area/production when
    aggregating to the country level.
  39: The vector X includes temperature, temperature squared, precipitation, and precipitation
    squared. Z is a binary variable indicating whether drought (Dit > D) or aridity
    (Ai > A) exceeds a threshold.
  40: The variable Dit is treated as continuous in the interaction terms of the model.
    The goal is to estimate the direct effect of dry spells at different levels of
    SPEI (D0).
  42: The number of observations decreases as more lags are introduced, likely due
    to data availability. The estimates reflect the effect of an additional dry spell
    day in a specification with specific thresholds for dry spells and heat waves.
  43: The number of observations ranges from 3153 to 4072 depending on the model specification.
    The table presents a robustness analysis of baseline results.
  45: The analysis considers dry spells of 28+ days and heat waves of 9+ days, but
    the table focuses only on the effect of the dry spell day.
  46: The table also includes the number of heat wave days with a minimum duration
    of 9 days as a covariate.
Quantitative material:
  9: Uses a 12-month SPEI. Also considers SPEI averaged over months prior to the hottest
    90 days (start-of-season drought). Irrigation data is the fraction of area irrigated
    per pixel (circa 2005).
  10: No specific quantitative results are mentioned on this page, but they do describe
    a data set of 118 countries.
  11: Growth rates in the FAO CPI are significantly negatively correlated with exposure
    to dry spells after removing country-specific means.
  12: "The equation (1) aims to quantify the marginal direct effect of an additional\
    \ dry spell day (\U0001D6FD1) on growth in the FAO CPI."
  13: The analysis produces coefficients (alpha, gamma, delta) that quantify the impact
    of the drivers of risk.
  14: "The equation \U0001D43A_\U0001D456\U0001D461 = \U0001D703_1^(\U0001D440\U0001D43C\

  16: The analysis focuses on the effects of an additional day in a dry spell at least
    28 days long (j=28), where they begin to see significant negative effects.
  17: Each additional dry spell day beyond 28 days during the hottest part of the
    year is associated with approximately 0.1 percentage point lower growth in the
    FAO CPI.
  18: Negative main effects of an additional day in a 28+ day dry spell on growth
    in crop production
  19: The main effect of heat waves is an order of magnitude larger than the interaction
    between dry spells and heat waves. Estimates under more permissive definitions
    of dry spells are smaller in magnitude (Appendix Table A5).
  20: Implies larger reductions in FAO CPI growth when a dry spell occurs in a location
    equipped for irrigation than from a similar spell in an area without such equipment
    (Table 5, column 3).
  21: Dry spell days exhibit a modest average direct effect on growth in crop production.
  23: Evidence of non-additivity when dry spells and heat waves occur in the same
    year, but not necessarily simultaneously.
  28: Net benefits to US soy and maize yields from intensifying hourly rainfall (Lesk
    et al., 2020); Changes in the drought sensitivity of US maize yields (Lobell et
    al., 2020); Greater sensitivity to drought accompanies maize yield increase in
    the US Midwest (Lobell et al., 2014); Climate trends and global crop production
    since 1980 (Lobell et al., 2011).
  31: Wheat yield loss attributable to heat waves, drought and water excess at the
    global, national and subnational scales.
  33: No relevant information
  34: Summary statistics (Min, Mean, Median, Max, SD) are provided for dry spell days,
    heat wave days, drought (SPEI), aridity index, irrigation, average temperature
    (C), and annual precipitation (m).

    coefficients and 95% confidence intervals under different water stress conditions
  36: Quantitative estimates provided for the impact of various weather conditions
    on growth, with coefficients and significance levels specified.
  37: There are quantitative estimates of the effects of dry spell days alone, heat
    wave days alone, the interaction of dry spell days and heat wave days, and days
    of joint dry spell and heat wave occurrence. The table provides coefficients and
    standard errors for each of these variables under different heat wave definitions
    (3+, 6+, 9+, and 12+ day heat waves).

    \ and \U0001D6FD\u030212."
  41: The table provides estimated marginal effects (e.g., -0.0001) of an additional
    dry spell day for various combinations of heat wave and dry spell durations. Standard
    errors are also provided.
  42: The table provides quantitative estimates of the impact of dry spell days (current
    and lagged up to 5 years) on the outcome variable. Coefficients and standard errors
    are reported. P-values for a null hypothesis that the sum of dry spell coefficients
    is zero are also given.
  43: Estimated effect of an additional dry spell day ranges from -0.0007 to -0.0014,
    with standard errors between 0.0005 and 0.0007. Statistical significance indicated
    by *, **, and *** for p<0.1, p<0.05, and p<0.01, respectively.
  44: The controlled direct effect of an additional dry spell day is quantitatively
    estimated with coefficients ranging from -0.0003 to -0.0013 across different minimum
    dry spell durations, with accompanying 95% confidence intervals and significance
    levels.
  45: An additional dry spell day has a statistically significant negative effect
    on growth in the FAO CPI. For the hottest 90 days, the unweighted effect is -0.0012
    (p<0.05), and the area-weighted effect is -0.0013 (p<0.1). For the hottest 120
    days, the unweighted effect is -0.0007 (p<0.1), and the area-weighted effect is
    -0.0007 (not statistically significant).
