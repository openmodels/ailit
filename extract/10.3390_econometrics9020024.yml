Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (increased CO2 concentrations, high local temperatures)
  3: Changes in short-term temperature extremes, especially if they coincide with
    the growth stage for many crops; global warming; extreme events.
  4: "Temperature anomalies (global annual temperature anomalies in \xB0C, number\
    \ of days during growing season with maximum temperature above various thresholds\
    \ (28-31\xB0C)), Precipitation variability (precipitation coefficient of variation,\
    \ precipitation concentration index, rainfall Gini index, precipitation absolute\
    \ deviations with respect to the historical mean)), El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a\
    \ events."
  5: "Global temperature anomalies, global CO2 concentration, drought intensification,\
    \ El Ni\xF1o/La Ni\xF1a phenomena, fertilizer use (phosphorus, potassium, nitrogen)"
  7: "Global temperature anomalies (temp), CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere (ln\
    \ CO2), number of days with maximum temperatures above 28, 29, 30 and 31\u25E6\
    C (max28, max29, max30 and max31), and adoption of no-tillage farming (notill).\
    \ Also, prices of seeds (lnseeds), fertilizer (lnpfertilizer) and soybeans (lnpsoybean)."
  8: "Soybean yields are influenced by weather anomalies like La Ni\xF1a, technological\
    \ improvements like GM seeds, no-till practices, and input-output prices such\
    \ as soybean and fertilizer prices."
  9: Temperature (lntemp), CO2 levels (lnCO2), adoption of no-till farming (no-till),
    new seed varieties (lnseeds), fertilizer prices (lnpfertilizer), and soybean prices
    (lnpsoybeans) are considered drivers.
  11: CO2 concentration growth, accumulated days of high temperature (max30t).

Highlights:
  1: Soybean yields adjust to disequilibria that reflect technological improvements
    to seed and crop practices; Climatic effects include (a) a positive effect from
    increased CO2 concentrations, which may capture accelerated photosynthesis, and
    (b) a negative effect from high local temperatures, which could increase with
    continued global warming.
  3: Soybean yields can be simultaneously influenced by climatic, technological, and
    economic factors.
  5: Global temperatures increased from 1974 to 2015 and can negatively affect crops.
    Increased CO2 may have positive effects on plant growth (carbon fertilization),
    but this can be eliminated by drought.
  7: The study aims to understand which variables are behind the observed trending
    behavior of soybean yields, studying long-run relationships assuming variables
    are first-order integrated.
  9: Only one cointegration relation is determined in each partial system using a
    5% level of significance.
  11: An increase in CO2 concentration growth produces higher soybean yields in the
    short run, but there are also negative effects of accumulated days of high temperature.
    The technology model dominates others in terms of information content in the long
    run.

Methodology:
  1: Multivariate time-series framework; Automatic model selection; Encompassing tests
    of different economic hypotheses; Partial system approach
  3: Econometric approach encompassing climatic, technological and economic factors
    affecting crop yields; annual series data from 1971 to 2015.
  4: "Econometric analysis using data from various sources (FAO, USDA, IFA, NOAA,\
    \ CDIAC, SMN, BOM, AAPRESID, INASE, SRNC, World Bank, M\xE1rgenes Agropecuarios).\
    \ The analysis considers daily data on maximum temperature and precipitation to\
    \ evaluate the impact of extreme heat and excess or lack of precipitation on soybean\
    \ yields. El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a phenomena are identified through the Southern\
    \ Oscillation Index (SOI)."
  5: Econometric analysis controlling for various determinants of soybean yields.
    Sample period not explicitly stated but covers at least 1974-2015.
  7: Cointegration analysis and Vector Autoregression (VAR) models are used to analyze
    the long-run relationships between variables in partial systems (climate, technological,
    and input-output prices) and encompassing tests are performed. Unit root tests
    (ADF, PP, KPSS) are used to determine the order of integration of the variables.
  8: Analysis uses econometric modeling with Autometrics to identify the dominant
    model from an unrestricted general model, including variables affecting soybean
    yields.
  9: Cointegration analysis using a VAR(2) model is employed to determine long-run
    relationships within climatic, technological, and price subsystems. Bootstrap
    and Bartlett trace statistics are used for cointegration rank determination. Results
    are applicable to the specific dataset and time period used in the analysis (not
    specified on this page).
  11: Equilibrium correction model estimated using OLS and instrumental variables
    (IV) for the period 1971-2015. Instruments used are the log difference of global
    fossil fuel consumption and its first lag, the log level of passenger cars and
    commercial vehicles and its first lag.

More Notes:
  1: Focuses on Argentina, a major soybean producer and exporter.
  3: Focuses on soybean yields in Argentina; adaptation measures are important to
    compensate for the adverse effects of climate change.
  5: The paper uses soybean yields in Argentina as a test case. It considers fertilizers
    as control variables because soybean plants require phosphorus and potassium,
    and to a lesser extent, nitrogen.
  9: 'The analysis considers three subsystems: climatic, technological, and prices,
    and how these affect agricultural yields.'
  11: The Sargan test validates the instrumental variables used in the IV estimations.

Quantitative material:
  1: Positive effect from increased CO2 concentrations; Negative effect from high
    local temperatures
  3: Soybean yield (measured as kilogram per hectare, kg/ha) increased from 1624 kg/ha
    in 1971 to 3175 kg/ha in 2015; Soybean production in Argentina increased by 2.5%
    annually from 1971 to 2015.
  5: "Global temperature anomalies ranged from -0.81\xB0C in 1974 to 0.86\xB0C in\
    \ 2015."
  8: The econometric model includes parameters for the long-term behavior of soybean
    yields, expressed in terms of log differences and cointegration analysis with
    bootstrap estimation.
  9: Cointegration analysis provides quantitative relationships between variables
    within climatic, technological, and prices subsystems. Long-run equations relate
    yields to other variables with estimated coefficients and standard errors (see
    Table 3, 4, and 5).
  11: Increase in CO2 concentration growth produces higher soybean yields; for median
    values of CO2 increases, the short-run effect on yield is about 18% (OLS estimation)
    and 29% (IV estimation), all else equal; the negative effects of cumulated days
    of high temperature (max30t) on soybean yields are also estimated.
