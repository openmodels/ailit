Drivers of Risk:
  3: Ocean acidification (a result of increasing carbon emissions), leading to declines
    in species biomass, especially Dungeness crab due to loss of prey.
  4: Warming, acidification, eutrophication, and other changes that are modifying
    marine ecosystems; ocean acidification (OA) caused by increasing global carbon
    emissions.
  6: Ocean acidification.
  7: pH changes and vulnerabilities
  10: Ocean acidification (OA) due to upwelling in the California Current.
  13: Ocean acidification (OA) effects, and fishing mortality rates.
  14: Changes in ex-vessel fisheries revenue (driven by climate change, though not
    explicitly stated here).
  17: Changes in ocean pH leading to mortality in functional groups of marine life
    and changes in biomass.
  18: Changes in pH affecting demersal functional groups of marine life.
  21: Projected pH changes, indirect food web effects, biomass trends, and species
    abundance.
  22: Declines in pH due to Ocean Acidification (OA) impacting Dungeness crab biomass;
    Changes in the catch of Petrale sole, Dover sole, Dungeness crab, and pandalid
    shrimp.
  23: Ocean acidification affecting various fish species is a major driver of risk.
  24: Ocean acidification within the California Current, driven by CO2 emissions.
  30: Changes in prey abundance, spatial overlap between predators and prey, and environmental
    conditions like decreases in prey resources driving cannibalism.
  31: Ocean acidification impacting marine ecosystems.
  32: Regional variations in pH affecting marine life in the California Current.
  46: Ocean acidification (OA) driven by declining pH levels in seawater.

Highlights:
  3: Ocean acidification may disproportionately affect revenue, income, and employment
    in the northern California to northern Washington State region due to declines
    in Dungeness crab populations.
  4: Impacts on human communities often depend on localized ecological change, making
    it critical to understand changes at a finer geographic scale; spatially heterogeneous
    variation in climate change impacts on those species can have socio-economic consequences
    that vary across communities.
  7: The study identifies where future research, monitoring and management focus is
    needed by exploring the potential consequences of pH changes and vulnerabilities
    for port revenue, income and employment in US west coast communities.
  13: The model allows for consideration of ocean acidification effects on fisheries
    catch without the confounding socioeconomic dynamics.
  14: Estimates direct, indirect, and induced effects on income and employment resulting
    from changes in ex-vessel fisheries revenue.
  17: 'The study focuses on the sole influence of pH on biomass and revenue, removing
    the influence of other oceanographic changes. They investigate revenue outputs
    at three scales: total port revenue, revenue by port and vessel type, and revenue
    by port and functional group.'
  18: Demersal functional groups are most affected by changes in pH. Sixteen functional
    groups experienced biomass effect sizes of |0.20| or greater, including invertebrates
    and demersal fishes.
  21: Projected pH changes and indirect food web effects can substantially change
    port revenue, with declines in Dungeness crab revenue being a major driver of
    negative impacts.
  22: Tillamook experienced the largest decline in revenue due to declines in Dungeness
    crab impacted by ocean acidification. Changes in employment at the port level
    were sometimes more exaggerated than the effect on revenue and income due to vessel
    types.
  23: Ocean acidification poses a risk to fishing revenue, income, and employment
    in several port cities across a variety of vessel types, although there are some
    specific exceptions, such as Pandalid shrimp.
  24: The largest economic consequences may occur for central and northern west coast
    ports that rely on demersal species for a large portion of fisheries catch, in
    particular Dungeness crab. Geographic variability of impacts resulted from the
    high resolution in the three components of our modeling framework.
  31: IO model estimates of impacts on employment and income did not substantially
    differ from changes in revenue, suggesting economic outputs are most useful for
    identifying ports with higher relative vulnerability. Ocean acidification has
    the potential to restructure marine ecosystems and strongly impact human communities
    dependent on marine resources.
  32: Dungeness crab is a major fishery resource, comprising 40-89% of revenue for
    8 out of 17 ports on the US West Coast.
  46: Benthic herbivorous grazers (sea urchins, snails) have a substantial negative
    effect size due to OA (-0.74 mean), as does Dungeness crab (-0.47 mean). The effect
    of OA varies considerably across regions, as seen in the min/max effect size values.

Methodology:
  3: Ecosystem model forced by oceanographic projections and coupled to an economic
    input-output model; intended to explore one possible future of ocean acidification's
    influence on the California Current coastline.
  4: Interdisciplinary approach that includes oceanographic conditions (such as temperature
    and/or pH) at high resolution, spatially explicit responses of the ecosystem to
    those conditions and the dependencies of local human communities on marine resources.
  6: The analysis employs oceanographic predictions from a Regional Oceanographic
    Modeling System (ROMS) model, forced by an earth system model (GFDL-ESM2M) under
    climate scenario RCP8.5; an Atlantis end-to-end marine ecosystem model; and an
    economic input-output model.
  7: An ecosystem model is used to investigate the impacts of ocean acidification
    in the California Current. Outputs from a fine-scale ocean model provide physical
    forcing for the Atlantis ecosystem model for the present and 50 years in the future.
    Outputs from Atlantis are passed to an economic input-output model (IO-PAC). Economic
    analysis is focused on the US west coast.
  10: A high-resolution Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) model of the California
    Current was used to simulate oceanographic conditions, particularly upwelling
    and ocean acidification (OA). The model output was then used to force the Atlantis
    ecological model to simulate multi-species ecosystem dynamics in a spatial framework.
    A single year's worth of oceanographic conditions (2013 and 2063) was looped 100
    times to achieve quasi-stable forcing for the ecological model, controlling for
    inter-annual variability.
  13: An Atlantis model is used to project port-level catches. Fishing mortality is
    set at a constant rate to match 2013 catch data from PacFIN. Spatially explicit
    fishing mortality rates are applied per port/country and functional group as constant
    fishing rates. This assumes no management responses or shifts in regimes and/or
    fishery behavior.
  14: "Uses an Input-Output (IO) model (specifically, the Northwest Fisheries Science\
    \ Center\u2019s input-output model for Pacific Coast fisheries (IO-PAC)) to investigate\
    \ direct, indirect, and induced effects of changes in fisheries revenue. Applied\
    \ at a port level and vessel type level, using 2013 prices."
  17: A 100-year model run is used to predict biomass under different oceanographic
    conditions. The effect size on revenue is calculated as the difference between
    revenue under 2063 conditions with and without pH mortality, standardized by 2013
    revenue. Only changes in biomass and revenue greater than |0.2| are reported.
  18: An IO-PAC model is used with multipliers to assess direct, indirect, and induced
    effects on income and employment due to changes in fisheries. The analysis considers
    fisheries revenue and processor effects at each port. Biomass effect sizes from
    changes in pH are calculated for different functional groups.
  21: Atlantis simulations were used to project port revenue based on biomass trends,
    with comparisons to 2013 PacFIN records.
  22: Analysis examines port-level revenue changes (RP) and income/employment impacts
    related to changes in fisheries catch. The analysis uses effect sizes and revenue
    proportions to assess impacts.
  24: Uses a modeling framework with high spatial resolution including the ROMS model,
    a spatially explicit ecosystem model, and spatially resolved fishing revenues
    used in an IO model. The Atlantis model is used for strategic management and exploration
    of ecosystem dynamics in the spirit of scenario analysis.
  30: The paper uses prescribed seasonal movement in a model, which handles large
    model domains under historic conditions, but limits the evolution of spatial variability
    in future projections. It uses a fisheries model called Atlantis and an economic
    analysis assuming fixed prices through the 2060s and no substitution between fisheries
    inputs.
  31: Input-Output (IO) models are used to analyze port-level outputs for the US west
    coast, estimating the impact of ocean acidification. The applicability of IO models
    extends to moderate future forecasts (15 years) and long-term forecasts over 50
    years. The authors suggest Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models as a potential
    improvement for long-term projections, as they factor in changing prices and input
    substitutions.
  32: Integrates physical, ecological, and economic consequences of climate change
    at a compatible spatial resolution with human communities and management.
  46: The study uses a model to calculate the effect size (Ei) for each species, weighted
    by biomass within each polygon, considering a 2063 pH mortality scenario (2063pHmortality
    scenario).

More Notes:
  3: The study focuses on the California Current region and the economic consequences
    for the fishing industry, specifically related to Dungeness crab productivity.
  4: The paper focuses on the impacts of marine ecosystem changes on human communities
    that rely on living marine resources.
  7: The study focuses on the 17 US port groups on the outer coast used by the Pacific
    Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) to aggregate data and avoid issues of disclosure
    of confidential information.
  10: The ROMS model does not represent nearshore environments (inshore of 50 meters)
    or land-based run-off as contributors to OA. The Atlantis model is a C++ code
    base.
  13: The model acknowledges limitations in ecosystem model persistence, particularly
    with multi-species models. The study focuses on the effects on fisheries catch.
    The authors admit the assumption of constant fishing rates and no behavioral changes
    is unrealistic.
  14: Focuses specifically on the fisheries sector, and the broader implications for
    macro-fiscal risk related to this sector.
  18: Three ports (Brookings, Crescent City and Bodega Bay) do not have processors,
    so only direct income and employment multipliers are used for those ports.
  23: The analysis uses port-level revenue data to assess impacts on vessel types.  Results
    may be confounded by model calibration difficulties, specifically for diver vessels.
    The model runs for 100 years up to 2063 conditions.
  24: The study focuses on a regional scale (California Current) which may not be
    directly applicable to a national-level analysis, but the modeling framework and
    consideration of spatial variability could be relevant.
  30: The model may oversimplify predator (specifically crab) diets, making them more
    sensitive to changes in the model than they would be to changes in the natural
    environment. The fixed price assumption and lack of input substitution in the
    economic analysis may limit the accuracy of the economic impact assessment.
  46: The study focuses on the impact of OA on specific marine functional groups and
    species, providing insights into their proportional mortality due to pH decline.

Quantitative material:
  3: Declines in species biomass tend to be larger in the southern region of the model,
    but the largest economic impacts on revenue, income and employment occur from
    northern California to northern Washington State.
  6: No work has estimated how ocean acidification may impact fisheries at finer spatial
    scales, such as the port-level.
  7: changes in catch, revenue, income and employment are simulated for 17 US port
    groups
  13: The model projects port-level catches in metric tonnes. The US west coast catch
    in 2013 was used to calibrate fishing mortality. Crangon shrimp accounted for
    0.1% of 2013 catch, other species accounted for 7.5% of 2013 US west coast catch.
    US vessels have access to coastal areas within 200km of the homeport and equal
    access to areas offshore to 1200m depth.
  14: Catch in metric tonnes landed at each port was converted to total revenue using
    2013 price per pound data.
  17: Equations [eq.1] and [eq.2] describe how changes in biomass and revenue are
    calculated.
  18: Economic multipliers (MI,D,j, MI,P,j, ME,D,j, ME,P,j) are used to calculate
    income and employment effects; Biomass effect sizes greater than |0.20| are considered
    substantial changes; Effects are calculated as the difference between scenarios
    in 2063 and standardized by 2013Baseline.
  21: "Simulated revenue per port ranged from 0.4 \u2013 1.48 (mean 1.07, SD 0.39,\
    \ Appendix C, Table C2). Declines in Dungeness crab revenue had effect sizes between\
    \ -0.42 and -1.0+ at the nine U.S. ports north of Fort Bragg, CA. Pandalid shrimp\
    \ revenue increased consistently by 0.3 at a number of ports."
  22: Ports experienced an effect size of -0.27 from declines in Petrale sole; Three
    ports experienced declines in revenue from Dover sole with an effect size of -0.39;
    Substantial port-level revenue changes occurred at ports with a large proportional
    reliance on Dungeness crab and flatfish (RP > |0.2|); Tillamook experienced the
    largest decline in revenue as a result of declines in pH due to Dungeness crab,
    which made up 97.3% of revenue in 2013Baseline (86.3% in PacFIN); Dover and Petrale
    sole made up a smaller proportion of port revenue (5.0-8.5% and 4.0-19.8% reliance
    respectively).
