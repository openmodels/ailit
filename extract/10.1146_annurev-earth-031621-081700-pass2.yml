Drivers of Risk:
  18: Weakening land sink for carbon due to climate warming, weakening CO2 fertilization,
    potential transition of sinks to sources at high and low latitudes, high temperatures,
    increasing respiration, drought, declining assistance from rising CO2, nonlinear
    carbon cycle responses.
Highlights:
  18: The likelihood of decreased biospheric uptake or release due to feedbacks may
    be higher than model ensembles suggest. Applying satellite data, networks, and
    data compilations regionally rather than globally is a critical emerging approach.
Methodology:
  18: Brief review of biases in model projections versus observational constraints,
    systematic application of emergent constraints simultaneously, use of global data
    from large eddy covariance networks, compilations of forest inventory and other
    data, and space-based estimates.
No relevant information:
  1: This page focuses on carbon cycle feedbacks and their impact on achieving climate
    goals, not macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, adaptation costs/benefits,
    or related economic measures at a national level. It discusses carbon sinks, tipping
    points, and the Paris Agreement.
  2: ''
  19: This page primarily discusses the carbon cycle and its impact on climate, focusing
    on scientific understanding, modeling, and observational challenges. It does not
    directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, costs, or benefits of
    adaptation at a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  18: Decreased remaining carbon budget, steeper emission reductions needed to achieve
    a given temperature target, more difficult mitigation, uncertainty in the future
    transient climate response to forcing.
