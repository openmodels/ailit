Drivers of Risk:
  1: Droughts (increased intensity and duration, increased frequency of consecutive
    drought years); Moderate economic growth.
  2: Drought projections and historical drought events, specifically affecting staple
    crops like maize and major cash crops.
  3: Drought impacts yield and area under cultivation, affecting food production and
    security.
  6: Droughts are identified as the shocks impacting crop production, yield, acreage,
    and food prices.
  7: Drought, population and income growth.
  8: Droughts affecting crop yields and acreage.
  9: Population and income changes; Low crop productivity coupled with small changes
    in crop area.
  10: Recurrent droughts in Southern Africa under moderate economic growth
  11: Recurrent droughts are identified as a driver of volatility in maize trade and
    food insecurity.
  12: Projected drought events and consecutive regional droughts in southern Africa.
  13: Regional consecutive droughts.
  14: Drought (indirectly, by impacting crop production and food security)
  15: Droughts.
  16: Drought is the primary driver of risk.
  17: Droughts
  18: Regional two-year droughts.
  19: Two-year droughts impacting food security in southern Africa.
  20: Drought
Highlights:
  1: Southern Africa would not become wealthy enough to mitigate food insecurity by
    2040 with moderate economic growth and no drought; Recurrent droughts would worsen
    food security by severely affecting maize production; Two-year droughts can significantly
    increase the population at risk of hunger.
  2: Maize is significantly impacted by drought, highlighting the need for potential
    alternative staple crops in southern Africa.
  3: Drought in Southern Africa during 2014/15 and 2015/16 led to significant reductions
    in maize production and impacted food security.
  6: Droughts are shown to have significant negative impacts on crop production and
    yield, with varying effects on food prices across different countries.
  7: Drought effects are incorporated into the IMPACT model as exogenous shocks to
    crop yields and/or acreage. The model considers both traded and non-traded legumes,
    with non-traded legumes priced based on national supply and demand, which can
    be considered a contract farming system.
  8: Most countries except South Africa and Angola would experience at least two consecutive
    drought events between 2025 and 2040.
  9: Without accounting for drought, food production growth will be slower than food
    demand growth in Southern Africa between 2010-2040, leading to increased import
    dependence for key staples.
  10: Recurrent droughts significantly impact agricultural production, with maize
    experiencing the largest reductions. Cowpea and, in some cases, soybeans and beans
    may experience increased production under drought conditions due to farmers switching
    crops.
  11: Droughts reduce regional maize consumption, leading to smaller net maize exports
    and increased reliance on imports, especially when South Africa experiences drought.
    Droughts worsen food insecurity, with the highest increase in the number of people
    at risk projected to occur in 2030.
  12: Southern Africa is projected to face increased drought events between 2025 and
    2040. Droughts will lead to increased prices and increased numbers of people at
    risk of hunger, especially in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Lesotho. Maize production
    will be particularly affected. Some crops may experience production increases.
  13: South Africa is projected to experience the highest proportional increase in
    the number of people at risk due to drought, nearly doubling in 2027.
  14: Production changes due to drought are similar between reported and simulated
    results for all countries and across all crops.
  15: Droughts significantly reduce agricultural production indices for all considered
    crops (maize, rice, soybean, groundnut, pigeon pea, beans, cowpea, cassava, cotton,
    tobacco) in Southern Africa from 2020 to 2040 compared to base conditions. Droughts
    also reduce net maize exports.
  16: Drought significantly reduces crop production, particularly maize, impacting
    food security in South Africa and Angola. The impact is more severe in consecutive
    drought years.
  17: Projected impact of droughts on food security in southern Africa, showing fluctuating
    but generally decreasing trends in population at risk of hunger between 2024 and
    2041.
  18: Drought impacts crop production differently across crops in Southern Africa.
    For some crops such as rice, drought conditions have a higher production index.
  19: Maize is a critical staple food in several countries, and diversification to
    drought-tolerant crops is recommended.
  20: Drought poses a significant risk to crop production and food security in Southern
    Africa, leading to an increase in the number of people at risk of hunger.
Methodology:
  1: Bio-economic modeling using an adjusted version of the International Model for
    the Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT), version 3.2;
    Projections up to 2040.
  2: Simulation of the impact of future droughts on food security and identification
    of pathways for enhancing food security under drought conditions.
  3: Analysis uses a bio-economic modeling approach, combining crop, climate, and
    economic models to project outcomes in Southern Africa.
  6: The analysis uses historical data to compute changes in production, yield, and
    food prices due to drought years compared to non-drought years, with specific
    drought years identified for each country.
  7: The IMPACT model is used to project agricultural production, consumption, and
    trade based on SSP4 scenarios, incorporating drought effects as exogenous shocks
    to crop yields and acreage. The model projects long-run agricultural production
    and food consumption based on international trade, and estimates food security
    using equations from Fischer et al. (2005). It uses a process-based modeling framework
    to assess long-run trends under 'what if' scenarios.
  8: Uses the IMPACT model, a partial equilibrium model focusing on the agricultural
    sector; drought frequency between 2000 and 2016 is used to project future drought
    occurrences between 2020 and 2035; the price effect of drought is applied as an
    additional markup on national food prices. When drought decreases regional maize
    production by more than 21%, the price increase from drought is also applied to
    all countries to reflect regional food scarcity.
  9: Projections based on moderate economic growth and no drought scenario in Southern
    Africa between 2010 and 2040.
  10: Model uses scenarios with and without recurrent droughts to project agricultural
    production and food security outcomes.
  11: The analysis uses results from IMPACT3.2 to project consumption patterns.
  12: Authors' computations from estimates in Table 3 are used for price effects.
    Projected future drought occurrences are re-arranged to generate regional two-year
    droughts. An analysis is done on the impact of droughts with a longer duration
    given that such droughts are projected to increase in the future in southern Africa.
    Moderate economic growth is assumed.

    production and net maize exports in Southern Africa. Assumes farmers can reallocate
    crop acreage and adjust input allocation in response to drought.
  16: The study uses the IMPACT 3.2 model to simulate the bio-economic impact of drought
    on crop production and food security. The model is calibrated using historical
    data on net imports and food insecurity. The results are projections for specific
    years (2030 for South Africa and 2027 for Angola).

More Notes:
  1: Key measures to enhance food security under droughts include breeding for stress-resilient
    maize, promoting crop and diet diversification, and investing in rainwater harvesting.
  7: IMPACT cannot be used to estimate short-term trends.
  8: The model assumes drought affects tobacco production in Malawi, Zimbabwe, and
    Zambia. The IMPACT model does not capture the indirect effects of droughts on
    the industrial and service sectors; simulated results from IMPACT on the effect
    of droughts on the number of people at risk of hunger is likely to be underestimated
    for some countries.
  9: The higher reliance on food imports would be partially caused by low crop productivity
    coupled with small changes in crop area in southern Africa.
  10: The paper focuses on the impact of drought on specific agricultural commodities
    and food security in Southern Africa, without explicitly linking these changes
    to broader macroeconomic or fiscal aggregates. The analysis considers both traded
    and non-traded commodities and their price responses to drought.
  11: The analysis differentiates between a "no drought" scenario and scenarios involving
    recurrent droughts to highlight the impact of drought on food security and trade.
    The figures present changes in consumption patterns for various food groups and
    specific products between 2010 and 2040.
  12: The reductions in regional maize production and consequent price effects and
    numbers of people at risk are sensitive to the occurrence of consecutive drought
    years.
  13: The graphs present data on production, consumption, and productivity changes
    for various crops and meats, potentially indicating the impact of droughts on
    agricultural output and trade in southern Africa.
  14: Model validation focuses on crop production under drought. Discrepancies between
    simulated and reported values are attributed to the model's assumptions not fully
    reflecting socio-economic factors influencing crop production.
  15: The IMPACT model simulates farmer behavior in Malawi, suggesting increased production
    of beans, cowpea, cotton, groundnuts, and tobacco in a drought year. The model
    suggests Zambia should maintain rice production and increase cassava, cotton,
    and groundnut production during droughts.
  18: The analysis focuses on agricultural production, a sector that can impact overall
    macroeconomic stability but this specific page lacks concrete details on how agricultural
    losses translate into specific GDP effects or fiscal outcomes.
  19: No direct macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes are discussed on this page.
  20: The paper appears to use a simulation model to assess the impact of drought
    on crop production and food security. The analysis is specific to Southern African
    countries and time periods.

Quantitative material:
  1: Consecutive two-year regional droughts (like 2014/15 and 2015/16) would increase
    the number of people at risk of hunger by at least 10% within a single year in
    most countries.

  8: 'Example: Mozambique is projected to experience drought in 2027; that year, food
    prices across the country would increase by 10%. Droughts reduce regional maize
    production by at least 21% in 2028.'
  10: Number of people at risk of hunger would increase by about 30% between 2010
    and 2040 to reach about 53 million people in 2035 in the 'no drought' scenario;
    regional share of population at risk would decrease slightly from 23% in 2010
    to 20% in 2040; regional maize production would decrease by about 25% due to projected
    drought in 2025; change in production in 2025 for other crops would range between
    -8% and 5%; regional cowpea production would rise by close to 20% in years Malawi
    is affected by drought; in 2030 South Africa maize production would decrease by
    46% under drought; maize yield would decrease by 32% and acreage by 20% in South
    Africa in 2030; cassava yield would decrease by 30% in Angola in 2027; regional
    bean production under drought would be highest in 2031, 2032, and 2037 when production
    would be around 7% higher under the scenario involving recurrent droughts.
  11: "Projected changes in consumption patterns in southern Africa under the \u2018\

  12: Table 4 presents projected drought events and drought price effects (%) across
    southern Africa between 2025 and 2040. Regional maize production decreases (e.g.,
    by 28, 25, 34, and 28% in 2025, 2028, 2030, and 2036, respectively, without price
    effects). National price increases are 34, 18, 62, and 31% higher in those years
    than estimates from a prior table. Specific drought price effects for Lesotho,
    Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Eswatini, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe
    are given. The number of people at risk of hunger would reach 1.9 million in Mozambique
    and 1.7 million in Zimbabwe. Lesotho would experience a 26% increase in the number
    of people at risk in 2030 and a 76% increase by 2033. South Africa would experience
    a 60% increase in the number of people at risk of hunger in 2025. Maize production
    would decrease by more than 40% in 2027. In 2026 and 2027 maize production would
    decrease by 38% and 42%, respectively. Tobacco production loss would reach about
    15%. Cotton production loss would be about 20%.
  13: The minimal number of people at risk due to regional recurrent droughts would
    be more than 6 million in 2027.  In 2027 the number of people at risk would nearly
    double in South Africa due to the recurrent drought. Most countries except Angola,
    Botswana, Madagascar, and Zambia would experience an increase of at least 10%
    in the number of people at risk during the regional consecutive droughts in 2021/22
    and 2026/27.
