Drivers of Risk:
  1: Population had the greatest effect on CO2 release in both regions, influencing
    climate change risks that impact the economy.
  2: Greenhouse gas emissions from sectors like electricity generation, agricultural
    production, and transportation; increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere.
  4: Agriculture, population, and national income per capita are examined as drivers
    of global warming and climate change, with the root cause identified as human
    activity.
  5: Urbanization and housing development in Turkey impacts agricultural field use.
  6: "CO2 emissions (Y), share of agricultural fields within total area (\u03C7),\
    \ agricultural added value (\u03C3), population (\u03B4)"
  9: Share of agricultural fields, agricultural added value, GDP per capita, and population,
    impacting CO2 emissions.
  10: 1% increase in population can be explained by a 1.98% increase in the CO2 level.
  11: "CO2 emissions (Y), share of agricultural fields within total area (\u03C7),\
    \ agricultural added value (\u03C3), population (\u03B4)"
  12: Population increase, share of agricultural fields within the total area, and
    GDP are identified as drivers affecting CO2 levels. Differences in cultivation
    practices, forest land ratios, and product patterns in agriculture also play a
    role.
Highlights:
  1: Population has the greatest effect on CO2 release, and awareness of environmental
    destruction or cost is important in avoiding macroeconomic balance deterioration.
  2: "A 1\xB0C temperature increase is estimated to cost 2 trillion dollars annually\
    \ by 2050."
  4: Agricultural added value, population, and GDP have movements in the same direction
    in Eurasian countries between 1993 and 2016, except for agricultural land in the
    Russian Federation.
  5: Long-term trends of CO2, agricultural area, agricultural value, population, and
    GDP in Turkey develop in the same trend as CO2.
  9: In Eurasia, GDP per capita has a positive significant effect on CO2 emissions,
    while in Turkey, it has a negative effect; similar trends for agricultural variables.
  10: GDP increases have potential environmental benefits through reduction in CO2
    levels after passing EKC peak point.
  11: In Eurasia, there is a short-term causality from agricultural fields to population
    and from agricultural added value to GDP. In Turkey, there is short-term causality
    from CO2 to population, agricultural fields to GDP, agricultural added value to
    population, population to CO2, agricultural fields, and agricultural added value,
    and GDP to population. The speed of adjustment to equilibrium (ECT) differs significantly
    between Eurasia and Turkey regarding CO2 levels.
  12: Population is determined to be the most effective variable affecting CO2 levels.
    Long-term deviations in the Eurasian region are eliminated in the short term,
    albeit with a small proportion, while long term deviations in Turkey are not balanced.
Methodology:
  1: Econometric models like ADF unit root test, ARDL, and VECM were used for the
    analysis covering the period between 1993 and 2016.
  2: The paper references present calculations and studies on the economic cost of
    global warming.
  4: The study examines the development trends of Eurasian countries and Turkey between
    1993 and 2016 using data on agricultural added value, agricultural land, population,
    GDP, and CO2 emissions. Trends of CO2, agricultural added value, population, and
    GDP are qualitatively compared.
  5: Factors affecting CO2 release were investigated for Eurasian countries and Turkey
    from 1993 to 2016, using variables like agricultural areas, agricultural added
    value, GDP, and population.
  6: Panel data analysis for 12 Eurasian countries, time series analysis for Turkey;
    Unit root test (ADF), Autoregressive distributed lag bound test (ARDL), Vector
    error correction model (VECM)
  8: Unit root tests are performed to check the stationarity of the series before
    evaluating the relationships between CO2 and other variables.
  9: Unit root tests and an ARDL model applied to analyze the long-run relationships
    between variables.
  10: Suitable lag length was determined for VECM (lag length of 2 for both Eurasian
    countries and Turkey).
  11: VECM (Vector Error Correction Model) is used to analyze the short-run causality
    and long-run relationships between CO2 emissions, agricultural land share, agricultural
    added value, GDP per capita, and population in Eurasia and Turkey. Results are
    applicable for the time period until 2016.
  12: The study uses VECM (Vector Error Correction Model) analysis to determine the
    long-run and short-run relationships between variables. The applicability of the
    results is geographically limited to the Eurasian region and Turkey and temporally
    to the period under study (likely 1993-2006, based on the text).
More Notes:
  2: The paper highlights the significant contribution of various sectors to greenhouse
    gas emissions, with power and heat generation, and agriculture, forestry and other
    land use being the largest contributors. Climate change affects sectors including
    agriculture, forestry, water, industry, tourism, energy and finance and insurance
    markets with agriculture being the most sensitive to these changes.
  4: The study uses data from the World Bank (2017) for Eurasian countries and Turkey.
  5: CO2 emissions continue to increase in Turkey even though the share of agricultural
    fields has been decreasing since 2005.
  11: The analysis distinguishes between short-run causality and long-run effects.
  12: The paper contrasts the situation in Turkey with that of the broader Eurasian
    region, noting differences in agricultural practices and economic development.
    It also highlights the role of policy actions and social awareness in mitigating
    environmental impact.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: All variables under study had an increasing effect on CO2 release in the Eurasian
    Region, with implications for environmental costs that may affect macroeconomic
    balances.
  2: "A 1\xB0C increase in global warming is estimated to lead to an annual economic\
    \ cost of 2 trillion dollars in 2050."
  4: GDP is examined as an important determinant and is related to agricultural added
    value, population, and CO2 emissions.
  5: No relevant information
  6: "GDP per capita (\u03BB)"
  9: Statistically significant long-run impact of GDP per capita on CO2 emissions
    in Eurasia and Turkey.
  10: 1% increase in GDP causes a decrease of 0.04% in the CO2 level.
  11: "GDP per capita (\u03BB)"
  12: The study suggests GDP has a positive linear relationship with environmental
    destruction (increasing CO2 release) in underdeveloped countries, but a negative
    relationship in developing or developed countries. Agricultural added value is
    also identified as having effects that increase CO2 release.
Quantitative material:
  2: "A 1\xB0C increase in global warming will lead to an annual economic cost of\
    \ 2 trillion dollars in 2050; CO2 level in the atmosphere increased nearly by\
    \ 30% since 1750 (from 280 ppm to 380 ppm); CO2 concentration increases around\
    \ by 1.5 ppm every year; Sectoral greenhouse gas releases: Industry (21%), Transportation\
    \ (14%), Buildings (6%), Agriculture and Forestry and Other Land Use (24%), Power\
    \ and Heat Generation (25%), Other Energy (10%)."
  4: "The graph 'Trend of CO\u2082 and Population' compares CO\u2082 emissions (kt)\
    \ and total population, with scales provided for each variable."
  5: No relevant information
  6: "Functional relation: ln Y = f(ln \u03C7, ln \u03C3, ln \u03BB, ln \u03B4)"
  9: Long-run coefficients and t-statistics for Eurasia and Turkey from the ARDL model
    for share of agricultural fields, agricultural added value, GDP per capita, and
    population on CO2 emissions.
  10: 1% increase in the agricultural fields decreases CO2 level by 1.83%.
  11: VECM approach results showing short-run causality between variables and long-run
    ECT values for both Eurasia and Turkey. For example, in Eurasia, the ECT value
    for CO2 is -0.0141, meaning a 0.014% imbalance in CO2 levels would take 71 years
    to disappear. In Turkey, the ECT value for CO2 is -1.325, meaning a 1.325% imbalance
    in CO2 levels would be balanced every 9 months.
  12: Population increase was 2.16% in the Eurasian region and 40.22% in Turkey (during
    the study period). The share of agricultural fields within the total area of the
    Eurasian region was 55.09% and 51.53% in Turkey.
