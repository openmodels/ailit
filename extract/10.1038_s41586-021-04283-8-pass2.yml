Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increases in the number of wet days and extreme daily rainfall are identified
    as factors impacting economic growth rates.
  2: The drivers of risk studied are total annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations,
    number of wet days, and extreme daily rainfall.
  3: Shocks impacting outcomes include 1-s.d. shocks in annual total rainfall, monthly
    rainfall deviations, number of wet days, and extreme daily rainfall.
  4: Extreme daily rainfall, number of wet days, monthly positive and negative rainfall.
  6: Annual total rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days, and extreme
    daily rainfall
  7: "Extreme daily rainfall (RA), wet days (RD(1mm), R\u02C6D(99.9%)), day-to-day\
    \ temperature variability (T), and the function of the annual mean temperature\
    \ (FT) are identified as drivers of risk."
  8: Annual total rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days, extreme
    daily rainfall.
  9: Annual total rainfall; monthly rainfall deviations; number of wet days; extreme
    daily rainfall
  10: Total annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days, and
    extreme daily rainfall.
  11: Total annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days, and
    annual mean temperature.
  12: The analysis examines the impact of daily temperature variability (T_var), annual
    mean temperature (T_mean) and rainfall characteristics including extreme daily
    rainfall, annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days on
    economic growth.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Economic growth rates are reduced by increases in the number of wet days and
    in extreme daily rainfall.
  2: This paper evaluates the impact of different aspects of daily rainfall distribution
    on economic growth rates.
  3: The paper provides an overview of the effects of different rainfall measures
    on economic growth rates.
  4: Assessment of the effect of rainfall on economic growth rates in different income
    categories and economic sectors.
  6: Subnational per-capita growth rates are estimated as the first difference of
    the logarithm of gross regional product per capita.
  7: Subnational growth rates are being evaluated.
  8: No relevant information
  9: No relevant information
  10: Economic growth response to changes in rainfall.
  11: Evaluates the impact of changes in rainfall on sectoral growth rates (agriculture,
    manufacturing, and services).
  12: The analysis evaluates the effect of temperature and rainfall changes on economic
    growth rates.
Highlights:
  1: High-income nations and the services and manufacturing sectors are most strongly
    hindered by both measures of daily rainfall.
  2: Greater annual rainfall benefits economic growth, but these benefits diminish
    with greater climatological rainfall totals. Economic growth rates are concave
    with monthly rainfall deviations, with negative shocks causing losses and positive
    shocks having a weaker effect. Increases in the number of wet days and in extreme
    daily rainfall cause reductions in growth rates. The effects of the number of
    wet days are smaller where the number is already higher, suggesting adaptation.
  3: Greater rainfall may be beneficial if it does not increase wet days or extreme
    daily rainfall; measures of extreme daily rainfall provide insights for fluvial
    flood impact assessments.
  4: Economic impacts of rainfall are strongest in winter and autumn; no short-term
    rebound effects detected; potential seasonal economic vulnerability identified.
  6: The paper finds a quadratic effect of the number of wet days and a dependence
    of the effect of extreme daily rainfall on economic growth.
  7: The authors find that considering a nonlinear effect of the number of wet days
    with income level increases the statistical power of the model.
  8: Rainfall is highest in regions like the Amazon, Central Africa, and Southeast
    Asia. Tropical regions have a higher number of wet days.
  9: Presents world maps showing the historical variability of four principal rainfall
    measures (annual total rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days,
    extreme daily rainfall) as standard deviations across the globe, from 1979-2019.
  10: The study differentiates economic responses to rainfall changes between rich
    and poor countries, indicating potentially different vulnerabilities or adaptive
    capacities.
  11: The graphs visualize the impact of various climatic factors on growth rates,
    highlighting differences across different sectors and incorporating uncertainty
    visualizations.
  12: Temperature variability, changes in mean temperature (both direct and lagged),
    rainfall extremes, annual rainfall, number of wet days, and their quadratic terms,
    as well as interaction terms of lagged temperature and rainfall all show statistically
    significant relationships with economic growth rates in both regionally and nationally
    clustered error regressions.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis assesses higher-order moments of the annual distribution of daily
    rainfall in conjunction with subnational economic output from 1,554 regions worldwide
    over the past 40 years.
  2: Fixed-effects panel regression models are applied to estimate the effect of aspects
    of the distribution of daily rainfall on economic production using within-region
    changes in climate variables from one year to the next. The analysis uses data
    at the subnational level covering 30,121 observations over the past 40 years,
    and also considers the spatial autocorrelation of rainfall measures.
  3: Effects of rainfall are assessed by including them as independent variables on
    economic growth rates, with the extent of independence explored by sequentially
    excluding measures.
  4: Analysis based on partitioning data by national income per capita and assessing
    sector-specific economic output; effects of rainfall stratified by season.
  6: Fixed-effects panel regression models are used to estimate relationships between
    changes in annual climate measures and subnational per-capita growth rates, including
    regional and yearly fixed effects.
  7: A regression equation (equation 5) is used to assess the impact of rainfall on
    growth rates, controlling for temperature variability and income. Heterogeneity
    of rainfall effects is assessed by partitioning nations by income level (above-
    and below-medium per capita income). Marginal effects are computed as the first
    derivative of equation (5) with respect to each rainfall measure and evaluated
    at sample means. Historical effect sizes are calculated by multiplying marginal
    effects by within-region standard deviations of rainfall measures.
  8: "Historical means (1979\u20132019) of four rainfall measures are mapped. Monthly\
    \ rainfall deviations are calculated as weighted annual sums of anomalies of monthly\
    \ rainfall from their climatological means. Extreme daily rainfall is the annual\
    \ sum of rainfall on days exceeding the 99.9th percentile of the historical distribution."
  9: "Calculates the historical standard deviation of annual values for different\
    \ rainfall measures over the years 1979\u20132019."
  10: Economic responses to rainfall are estimated separately for rich and poor countries
    across 14 dryland sites. The marginal effect on growth for each climatic factor
    is shown in each panel, including trend lines and histograms that display distribution
    and relationships.
  11: Economic responses to rainfall are estimated for the agricultural, manufacturing,
    and service sectors separately. The analysis uses different datasets (indicated
    by colors) and includes confidence intervals around the estimated effects.
  12: The analysis uses an econometric specification with regression analysis. The
    table includes regression coefficients, standard errors, and significance levels.
    The results are applicable to the specific data and model used in the study. The
    use of 'first difference' and 'one-year lag' suggests a panel data or time series
    approach.
More Notes:
  6: Climate data is obtained from ERA-5, MSWEP, and PGF datasets, while economic
    data comes from the DoSE database.
  7: The analysis uses ERA-5 climate data and economic production data. Code and data
    are available in public repositories. The study acknowledges funding from the
    Volkswagen Foundation and the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the European
    Union.
  8: Monthly rainfall deviations are 'unitless'.
  9: The maps use a color gradient from light to dark red to represent the magnitude
    of the standard deviation, indicating the level of historical variability in each
    rainfall measure.
  10: The study focuses on dryland sites. The 'Rich' and 'Poor' groups are not explicitly
    defined but likely refer to countries or regions classified by economic indicators.
  11: "The X-axes of the graphs cover Total annual rainfall in millimeters (mm), Monthly\
    \ rainfall deviations (standard deviations), Number of wet days, and Annual mean\
    \ temperature (\xB0C)."
  12: The table distinguishes results based on whether standard errors are clustered
    regionally or nationally, which affects the significance and sometimes the direction
    of the estimated effects. The Adjusted R2 of 0.19 indicates that the model explains
    19% of the variance in economic growth rates.
Quantitative material:
  2: Marginal effects on growth rates (% points per 1-s.d. increase) are quantified
    as a function of total annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of
    wet days, and extreme daily rainfall. It also states that increases in the number
    of days with rainfall exceeding 1 mm result in strong reductions in growth rates.
  3: It provides global/sample mean effects on economic growth rates for each rainfall
    measure.
  4: Estimates of the effect on economic growth rates of a 1-s.d. shock are shown;
    details on the effect size are not specified in the text.
  6: "The paper identifies statistically significant effects from two measures: the\
    \ number of wet days RD(1 mm)x,y and the measure of extreme daily rainfall RD\u02C6\
    (99.9%)x,y."
  7: The paper describes percentage-point effects on subnational growth rates.
  8: Annual total rainfall ranges from 0 to 4000 mm. Number of wet days ranges from
    0 to 365 days. Extreme daily rainfall ranges from 0 to 100 (units unspecified).
  9: Historical standard deviation of annual total rainfall (mm); historical standard
    deviation of monthly rainfall deviations (unitless); historical standard deviation
    of number of wet days (days); historical standard deviation of extreme daily rainfall
    (mm)
  10: Marginal effect on growth relative to average conditions is quantified for different
    climatic factors.
  11: Marginal effects on growth rates are presented as percent increase per 1-standard-deviation
    increase in the climatic factors.
  12: The table provides regression coefficients that represent the %-point effect
    on economic growth rates per unit increase in the given climate measure. For example,
    a 1-unit increase in T_var is associated with an 8.5e-02 %-point change in economic
    growth when errors are clustered regionally, and a -5.8e-02 %-point change when
    clustered nationally. Similar quantitative results are presented for all listed
    variables.
