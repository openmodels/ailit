Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increases in the number of wet days, extreme daily rainfall, and deviations from
    total annual and standardized monthly rainfall.
  2: Total annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet days, extreme
    daily rainfall.
  3: 'Shocks to rainfall measures: annual total rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations
    (negative shock), number of wet days, extreme daily rainfall.'
  4: Extreme daily rainfall, Number of wet days, Monthly positive rainfall deviations,
    Monthly negative rainfall deviations, Annual total rainfall
  5: 'Changes in rainfall patterns including: annual total rainfall, monthly rainfall
    deviations, number of wet days, and extreme daily rainfall'
  7: Extreme daily rainfall, annual mean temperature, and day-to-day temperature variability
  10: Changes in total annual rainfall, monthly rainfall deviations, number of wet
    days, and extreme daily rainfall.
  12: Daily temperature variability, annual mean temperature changes (first difference
    and one-year lag, also squared), annual rainfall (also squared), monthly rainfall
    deviations (also squared), number of wet days (also squared), and extreme daily
    rainfall, including interaction with mean temperature.
Highlights:
  1: Economic growth rates are reduced by increases in the number of wet days and
    in extreme daily rainfall. High-income nations and the service and manufacturing
    sectors are most strongly hindered by both measures of daily rainfall.
  2: Economic growth rates are strongly concave with monthly rainfall deviations.
    Increases in the number of days with rainfall exceeding 1mm result in strong reductions
    in growth rates. Increases in extreme daily rainfall cause further reductions
    in growth rates.
  3: The effects from rainfall are separately identifiable when included as competing
    independent variables on economic growth rates, suggesting that they constitute
    independent, additive effects.
  4: Effects of wet days and extreme daily rainfall are strongest in winter and autumn,
    showing little response in summer and spring. The modulating effect of annual
    mean temperature reduces vulnerability to extreme rainfall. There is some persistence
    in the effect of annual total and number of wet days. Economic impacts have been
    largest from the number of wet days and negative monthly rainfall deviations.
  5: Increases in extreme daily rainfall and the number of wet days are adverse for
    economic growth, particularly in high-income countries and via the manufacturing
    and services sectors.
  7: The study strengthens the interpretation of effects as independent and additive.
  10: The effect of rainfall on growth rates differs substantially between rich and
    poor countries.
  12: The table presents regression coefficients showing the impact of various climate
    variables on economic growth rates, with significance levels indicated. It models
    both linear and non-linear effects (squared terms).
Methodology:
  1: Uses a global panel dataset and assesses higher-order moments of the annual distribution
    of daily rainfall in conjunction with subnational economic output. Employs a threshold
    approach using constants or percentiles of the historical distribution (1979-2019)
    of local daily rainfall.  Calculates total annual rainfall and standardized monthly
    rainfall anomalies.
  2: Fixed-effects panel regression models using within-region changes in climate
    variables from one year to the next. Subnational level data used. Historical data
    from 1979-2019.
  3: "The estimates are obtained via the product of the region-specific marginal effects\
    \ and the region-specific standard deviation for each rainfall measure (from annual\
    \ variability over the historical period 1979\u20132019)."
  4: Panel data regression is used to estimate the effect of rainfall measures on
    economic growth rates. The analysis is performed by partitioning data based on
    national income per capita and assessing sector-specific economic output. Distributed
    lag models are used to assess persistence of climate impacts. Historical standard
    deviation of rainfall measures are multiplied by regional estimates of the marginal
    effects to assess spatial heterogeneity.
  5: Regression analysis assessing the effects of different rainfall measures on sectoral
    economic output and on above- and below-median national income countries.
  7: Regression analysis is used to assess the impact of rainfall and temperature
    variables on subnational growth rates, including partitioning data by income level
    to assess heterogeneity.
  10: Economic responses to rainfall were estimated separately for rich and poor countries.
  12: Econometric regression analysis with clustered errors (regionally and nationally)
    to estimate the impact of temperature and rainfall changes on economic growth
    rates.
More Notes:
  1: The study suggests that the anthropogenic intensification of daily rainfall extremes
    will have negative global economic consequences.
  2: Spatial autocorrelation of rainfall measures is evaluated at the subnational
    level.
  3: The marginal effects of increases in extreme daily rainfall show a regional heterogeneity
    that is best described by the annual mean temperature.
  4: Spatial heterogeneity is considered. Includes analysis of the agriculture, manufacturing
    and services sectors. The analysis considers the effect of rainfall by season,
    income, and region.
  5: Price effects may mask some of the response of agriculture when assessed using
    monetary output instead of physical measures of agricultural output.
  7: The analysis includes controls for temperature variability and uses within-region
    standard deviations to assess the magnitude of historical effect sizes.
  10: The effect of rainfall on growth rate depends on the type of rainfall being
    studied (e.g., extreme rainfall, number of wet days)
  12: The results are based on the main econometric specification used in the study.
    The table includes both temperature and rainfall measures, along with lagged and
    differenced terms to capture dynamic effects.

    to the number of wet days (+47%) and a much more statistically significant response
    to extreme daily rainfall.
