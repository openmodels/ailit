Drivers of Risk:
  5: Climate change, specifically risks associated with high emissions scenarios and
    the effects of reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions.
  6: Changes in climate hazards (hot and cold spells, floods, droughts, windstorms)
    and climate resources (temperature and rainfall patterns affecting activities
    like crop growth and energy demand).
  7: Maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall, snow depth, and the Met Office Fire
    Severity Index are the key drivers of risk considered in the paper.
  8: Changes in temperature (heat stress on crops, parasitic infection of sheep, milk
    yields in cattle), drought (SPEI6), wildfire hazard (MOFSI), river flood risk
    (likelihood of exceeding 10-year flood), and water resource drought (Standardized
    Streamflow Index).
  12: Climate change, specifically heatwaves and river flood risk
  14: Temperature extremes (especially in Scotland), rainfall uncertainty
  19: Changes in climate variables like SPEI, SSI, heatwave alerts, Degree days, FFMC,
    MOFSI are considered drivers of risk.
  20: 'Changes in climate variables, specifically related to: adverse weather days,
    heatwave degree days, flood degree days, drought percentiles (SPEISSI), heat-health
    alerts'
  21: Increased heatwaves, changes in precipitation patterns leading to drought (agricultural
    and hydrological), and increased wildfire risk.
  24: High, medium, and low emissions scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP6.0, RCP8.5) and pathways
    leading to 2, 3, and 4 degree Celsius increases by 2100. Key climate variables
    driving risk include temperature, rainfall, and runoff.
  25: Changes in climate hazards (heat extremes, droughts, wildfire danger, fluvial
    flood hazard) driven by greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.
Highlights:
  5: The paper aims to determine the risks associated with high emissions through
    the 21st century across sectors in the UK, and to assess the impact of global
    greenhouse gas emission reductions on risks in the UK, with a focus on implications
    for climate resilience policy development.
  7: The paper highlights the risks to health, energy use, transport, agriculture,
    wildfire, and hydrological systems due to climate change.
  8: The study calculates indicators relevant to agriculture, wildfire hazard, river
    flood risk, and water resources drought.
  12: Heatwave risk is projected to increase significantly across the UK, with Scotland
    and Northern Ireland experiencing the largest relative increases.
  14: HadGEM3 projections consistently show larger increases in temperature and rainfall
    in the north than CMIP5 projections, driving different changes in modelled variables.
  20: The data highlights projected changes in climate indices related to temperature
    (heating/cooling degree days, heatwaves), rainfall (floods, drought), and adverse
    weather conditions. It provides quantitative ranges and medians for these indices,
    allowing for comparison across different climate models and time periods.
  21: Projects significant changes in heatwaves, drought, and wildfire risk across
    the UK by the late 21st century, with varying regional impacts.
  24: Reducing emissions lowers, but does not eliminate, the widespread increases
    in climate-related risks. The effect of reducing emissions varies between indicators
    and across the UK. The difference between low and high emissions projections is
    small relative to the uncertainty range until at least the 2040s, but varies between
    indicators. Adaptation and resilience strategies should consider high emission
    scenarios, however the 'worst case' scenarios should be assessed in terms of their
    plausibility.
  25: Climate hazards will increase across the whole of the UK in the absence of adaptation.
    Risks associated with high temperature extremes will increase the most in warmer
    southern and eastern England. Reducing future emissions reduces, but does not
    eliminate, climate risks. Adaptation and resilience policy must recognize variability
    in change in risk across the UK.
Methodology:
  5: Calculation of policy-relevant indicators of climate risk using UKCP18 climate
    projections, applied to observed HadUK-Grid climate data using the delta method.
    Natural variability is derived from the observational period (1981-2010 reference
    period).
  6: 'The analysis calculates climate risk indicators at a fine spatial resolution
    (1x1 km or 12x12 km) and then averages them to regional and national scales. It
    focuses on seven characteristics of climate hazard/resource: magnitude, duration,
    frequency, likelihood, variability, timing, and spatial extent. Thresholds are
    used to define hazards/resources or to identify critical exceedances and impacts.'
  7: The analysis calculates various climate risk indicators based on temperature,
    rainfall, and other weather parameters. The indicators are calculated for specific
    regions and weighted by population, railway length, or area of cropland and grassland,
    depending on the sector. Results are applicable for assessing climate-related
    risks across different sectors.
  8: Uses agri-climate indicators, MOFSI for wildfire, UKCEH Grid-to-Grid model (G2G)
    for hydrology, and HadUK-Grid observational data.
  12: Comparison of HadGEM3 and CMIP5 climate projections to assess changes in climate
    risk indicators.
  14: Uses observed climate hazards and resources data from 1981-2010 to create regional
    averages.
  19: Uses CMIP5 climate model projections to assess changes in climate indicators
    and related risks. Mentions Met Office Heat-health alerts as an indicator. Mentions
    the use of -1.5 degree C as a reference point.
  20: The analysis uses climate models (CMIP5, HadGEM) to project changes in climate
    indices under different time periods. It appears to be focused on modeling climate
    impacts across various regions of the UK (Scotland, Ireland, Northern).
  21: "Median estimate from the HadGEM3 ensemble under the RCP8.5 scenario, projections\
    \ for the period 2071\u20132100."
  24: The paper uses the UKCP18 probabilistic projections, a simpler hydrological
    model to estimate winter and summer runoff changes, and examines various risk
    indicators across the UK under different emissions scenarios. The analysis is
    applicable for the UK and focuses on the period up to 2100.
  25: The paper uses UKCP18 climate projections to calculate policy-relevant indicators
    of changing climate risks. It focuses on the hazard component of risk across different
    sectors. It uses a consistent approach across sectors. It presents plausible projections
    of change in risk under different emissions assumptions.
More Notes:
  6: The paper uses indicators based on health-alert thresholds and building management
    thresholds, which are indirectly related to economic costs/benefits through health
    impacts and energy demand. The analysis assumes that critical thresholds do not
    change over time, while noting this is unlikely in practice due to adaptation
    and other policy changes.
  7: The paper mentions that performance and punctuality standards of rail operating
    companies are slightly relaxed on days with 'bad' weather.
  8: The study acknowledges limitations, including the lack of indicators for the
    natural environment, coastal zone, extreme storms, short-duration precipitation,
    and compound events. The study focuses on the UK.
  12: The magnitude of change in risk indicators shows large uncertainty across projections
    and differs depending on the projection set used (HadGEM3 vs. CMIP5). River flood
    risk is an exception, with HadGEM3 projections showing smaller increases in risk
    than CMIP5 projections.
  14: MOFSI (likely referring to the Met Office Fire Severity Index) is sensitive
    to rainfall uncertainty; adverse weather impact on rail is primarily driven by
    temperature extremes except in Scotland.
  19: The page appears to present data on climate-related indicators and their projected
    changes, but does not explicitly quantify macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes.
  20: The table seems to focus on the UK, with specific mentions of Scotland, Ireland,
    and Northern. It identifies vulnerable sectors (Rail, Growing Wheat, Agricultural)
    and highlights the importance of factors like FFMC (Fire Weather Index), MOFSI
    (Modified Famine Standard Index) and hydrological conditions in assessing climate
    risks. The indices provided appear to be part of an early warning system (alerts).
    The data seems to be regionalized with a spatial scale of 6m and 12m
  21: The HadGEM3 ensemble projects more extreme outcomes (higher temperatures and
    lower relative humidity) than the CMIP5 ensemble, potentially exaggerating the
    projected changes.
  24: The paper highlights the importance of considering both mitigation and adaptation
    strategies, as even with significant emissions reductions, some increase in risk
    is unavoidable in the near term. The spatial variation in risk across the UK necessitates
    region-specific adaptation and resilience priorities. There are differences between
    the HadGEM3 and CMIP5 members of the UKCP18 ensemble, and reliance on the HadGEM3
    projections alone potentially gives a partial indication of the range of uncertainty.
  25: The paper doesn't consider changes in exposure and vulnerability. The paper
    highlights the importance of adaptation and resilience policies.
