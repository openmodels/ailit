Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Intensification of Northern Hemisphere summer monsoon due to mega-El Ni\xF1\
    o/Southern Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation."
  5: Mega-ENSO and AMO (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) are primary sources of
    the interdecadal variations of the NHSM (Northern Hemisphere Summer Monsoon) and
    the recent intensification of the NHSM may be largely due to internal natural
    variability.
Highlights:
  1: Coherent decadal change of precipitation and circulation emerges in the entirety
    of the NHSM system with recent global warming. NHSM as well as Hadley and Walker
    circulations have shown substantial intensification.
  5: The recent intensification of the NHSM may be largely due to internal natural
    variability, driven by mega-ENSO and AMO.
Methodology:
  1: Integrated study of changes in Northern Hemisphere summer monsoon system, defined
    as coherent changes of monsoon precipitation and circulation. Analyzes summer
    mean precipitation rate averaged over the entire NH monsoon domain (May to September).
    Defines a NHSM circulation index by the vertical shear of zonal winds between
    850 and 200 hPa averaged in a specific zone.
  5: Statistical analysis of precipitation and wind datasets (GPCP, CMAP, 20th century
    reanalysis, ERA40, ERA-Interim, NCEP reanalysis); regression analysis; ensemble
    mean of datasets; low-pass filter (3-y running mean) to determine decadal variations;
    sensitivity tests with 5-y running mean; use of coupled climate models (POEM,
    CMIP5).
More Notes:
  1: "The interannual variation of NHSM rainfall exhibits a cohesive pattern that\
    \ is highly correlated with the El Ni\xF1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index."
  5: The paper examines the influence of natural climate variability (mega-ENSO, AMO)
    on the Northern Hemisphere Summer Monsoon (NHSM) system.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  5: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: NHSM rainfall increased by 9.5% per degree of global warming.
  5: "Mega-ENSO index correlation with NHSM circulation index (r = 0.77); AMO correlation\
    \ with NHSM circulation index (r = 0.44 for 1958\u20132011); combined effect of\
    \ mega-ENSO and AMO can explain 73% (r = 0.85 for 1958\u20132011) of the total\
    \ variance of the NHSM circulation index; correlation between interannual component\
    \ of ENSO and mega-ENSO is 0.96 for the period of 1958\u20132010."
