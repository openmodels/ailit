Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts, sea level rise, and changes to the frequency and intensity
    of storms are projected to increase coastal land and assets exposed to coastal
    erosion.
  2: Sea level rise (SLR) and changes to shoreline position.
  6: Storm erosion, trapping of sand due to the extension of the Tweed River training
    walls.
  8: The extension of the Tweed River training walls in 1962 is identified as the
    primary driver of shoreline recession on the southern Gold Coast.
  11: Sand trapped by extended Tweed River training walls, sea level rise.
  13: Sea level rise associated with IPCC RCP scenarios affecting urban coastal areas
    like the southern Gold Coast.
  14: Sea Level Rise (SLR) under different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)
  15: RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios; Global emissions of greenhouse gases.
  16: Limited adaptation options in Australia's Gold Coast due to significant private
    and public infrastructure investment in coastal hazard zones.

Highlights:
  1: Significant step-up in expected costs of implementing coastal protection between
    RCP2.6 and RCP8.5.
  2: "Past experience of implementing a coastal protection strategy for the Gold Coast\u2019\
    s southern beaches between 1964 and 1999 is used to calculate a net present value\
    \ (NPV) for implementing a protection strategy, per km, of sandy beach shoreline\
    \ against each of the IPCC\u2019s four representative concentration pathways (RCP)\
    \ to 2100."
  6: Extension of training walls significantly altered longshore transport, leading
    to sand accumulation and increased vulnerability to storm damage.
  8: The extension of the Tweed River training walls significantly impacted the Gold
    Coast shoreline, necessitating substantial coastal protection interventions.
  11: Extension of Tweed River training walls caused sand trapping, leading to expected
    shoreline recession of 62m on the Gold Coast between 1960 and 2000 if no intervention.
  13: NPV of coastal protection per kilometre ranges from $574,000/km for RCP 2.6
    to $1.715 million/km for RCP 8.5 using a 3% discount rate.
  14: Provides cost estimates for coastal protection under different climate change
    scenarios (RCPs) in a predominantly beached, urban location.
  15: Significant step-up in expected costs of coastal defenses between RCP2.6 and
    RCP8.5; Defensive costs will never approach replacement cost damages.
  16: Local governments in Australia face potential revenue strain from coastal adaptation
    costs despite favorable asset-to-liability ratios.

Methodology:
  1: "Uses historical responses to shoreline change on Australia\u2019s Gold Coast\
    \ between 1964 and 1999 to estimate costs of coastal adaptation to sea level rise.\
    \ Compiles data on the timing, units, and cost of coastal protection works. Analyzes\
    \ shoreline position and characteristics using the Bruun model to determine implied\
    \ sea level rise at the time projects were completed. An economic model updates\
    \ project costs based on the projected timing of sea level rise and calculates\
    \ NPV per km of sandy beach shoreline."
  2: The analysis compiles historical data on coastal protection projects (timing,
    units, and cost) on the Gold Coast between 1964 and 1999. Changes to shoreline
    position are analyzed through the Bruun model to determine the implied sea level
    rise. An economic model updates the project costs based on the projected timing
    of sea level rise and calculates NPV.
  6: Historical analysis of coastal events and their causes, including the impact
    of infrastructure projects on sand transport.
  8: The study uses a counterfactual analysis based on interviews, literature reviews,
    and historical records. It compares the actual shoreline and coastal protection
    responses to a scenario where the Tweed River training walls were not extended.
    A wave and shoreline evolution model was used to establish the impact of the training
    walls.
  11: Bruun model and a rearranged form to calculate sea level rise (S = R * (B+h)
    / L) and to estimate shoreline recession (R).
  13: Economic model estimating historical project costs and future sea level implications,
    inflating costs to 2100, discounting future project costs, and applying an inflating
    maintenance cost.
  14: Estimated indicative costs to implement a coastal protection strategy involving
    seawalls, groynes, and beach nourishment for the southern Gold Coast. Assumes
    reactive and adaptive decision-making at a local scale, broadly aligning with
    past decision-making.
  15: Implicit cost benefit analysis of past defensive actions; NPV calculation of
    defensive costs; Comparison of defensive costs to property values.
  16: Assumes a consistent beach profile for 13 km of shoreline, with recognition
    of potential variation.

More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on coastal protection strategies and costs, specifically for
    sandy beach shorelines, and may not be generalizable to other adaptation measures
    or geographic locations without careful consideration of local conditions.
  2: The study focuses on coastal protection in the Gold Coast, Australia. The Bruun
    model is used, despite criticisms of its capacity to predict beach responses to
    sea level rise. The analysis considers the social dimension of beaches due to
    proximity to high-value development.
  6: The case study highlights the importance of understanding coastal processes and
    the potential unintended consequences of engineering interventions.
  8: The paper focuses on a specific case study of coastal erosion and management
    on the Gold Coast, rather than a nation-wide macroeconomic or macro-fiscal analysis.
  14: The study focuses on a specific location (southern Gold Coast) and may not be
    directly generalizable to other national contexts. The analysis does not calculate
    and compare costs to accumulated benefits.
  15: Authors do not advocate ad hoc, reactive adaptation. CBA can provide a false
    sense of certainty because climate change and its impacts are inherently unpredictable.
    Historical observations can counterbalance rational planning.
  16: The burden of adaptation will be on both private and public funding, with local
    governments likely bearing significant costs.

Quantitative material:
  1: "Expected costs of implementing coastal protection between RCP2.6 and RCP8.5\u2014\
    from $573,792/km to $1.7 million/km, or a factor of nearly 3, using a social discount\
    \ rate of 3%. This step-up is by a factor of more than 6 at a social discount\
    \ rate of 1%."
  2: "Project costs for coastal protection works between 1964 and 1999 on the Gold\
    \ Coast, Australia. Future projections for global mean sea level rise over the\
    \ course of the century range from less than 0.43m for RCP2.6 to 0.84 m for RCP8.5.\
    \ Historical global mean sea level has risen by 0.16m between 1902 and 2015, with\
    \ the rate of rise increasing from 1.4 mm per year between 1901\u20131990, to\
    \ 3.6 mm per year between 2006 and 2015."
  6: The extended training walls were estimated to have trapped more than 2 million
    m3 of sand.
  8: From 1968 to 2000, 43 interventions were undertaken, installing nearly 12,000m
    of seawall and 1150m of groynes and nourishing beaches with nearly 11 million
    m3 of sand.
  11: Between 1960 and 2000, 62 meters of recession of the shoreline across the southern
    Gold Coast is expected without intervention, due to sand trapped by the Tweed
    River training walls.

    \ is by a factor of more than 6 at a social discount rate (r= 1%). Crude valuation\
    \ of defensive costs of a 200m stretch of coastal development in the suburb of\
    \ Kirra, for example, has an NPV of AUD 3562."
