Drivers of Risk:
  1: Emissions of CO2 and CH4 from thawing permafrost due to climate warming.
  2: Permafrost emissions of CO2 and CH4; Changes in global mean temperature.
  4: CO2 and CH4 emissions from thawing permafrost.
Highlights:
  1: "Permafrost emissions increase the global mean temperature by an additional 0.17\u02DA\
    C (5-95% range: 0.11-0.25\u02DAC) by 2100 under the default PAGE09 model."
  2: Permafrost emissions significantly increase global economic impacts and the risk
    of catastrophic events like ice sheet thawing.; Aggressive abatement strategies
    are needed to minimize the impacts of permafrost emissions.; There have been no
    estimates of the possible extra economic impacts from permafrost emissions of
    CO2 and CH4 prior to this study.
  4: Thawing permafrost has significant economic impacts, with the magnitude dependent
    on factors such as TCR, PTP, EMUC, Emissions Uncertainty, FRT, and POW_2.
Methodology:
  1: The study links the integrated assessment model PAGE09 with the SiBCASA biophysical
    land surface parameterization model and runs 100,000 simulations of the PAGE09
    model, perturbing various parameters to explore risks.
  2: Uses the PAGE09 model under different scenarios (A1B with SSP2 and SSP3 socio-economic
    scenarios, and UK Met Office 2015r5low scenario); Calculates the net present value
    (NPV) of extra economic impacts.
  4: The analysis uses the default PAGE9 model for the IPCC AR4 A1B scenario.
More Notes:
  1: Additional economic losses such as infrastructure damage are not included in
    the study.
  2: The uncertainty range in impact estimates is wide due to the nonlinear interactions
    within the model.
  4: Figure 6 suggests the relative importance of different parameters in influencing
    the estimated impacts, specifically looking at NPV in US$ Trillions. TCR and PTP
    have substantial influence. The graphs show how the change in output mean varies
    across input percentiles.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: "The study defines economic impacts as those included in GDP, such as agricultural\
    \ losses and air conditioning costs, and non-economic impacts such as human health\
    \ and ecosystem impacts\u2014all included in the study as 'economic' impacts."
  2: Global GDP loss; Extra economic impacts.
  4: Extra annual economic impacts from permafrost CO2 and CH4 emissions (in US$ trillions)
Quantitative material:
  1: "The CO2 and CH4 released from permafrost increases the mean net present value\
    \ (NPV) of climate change impacts by US$43 trillion, or about 13% (5-95% range\
    \ US$3 \u2013 US$166 trillion), under the A1B scenario."
  2: Mean annual value of extra impacts is about US $2.8 trillion in 2100 (about 0.35%
    of projected global GDP) and peaks at about US $30 trillion in 2200 (about 0.7%
    of projected GDP).; Permafrost emissions represent about 10% of cumulative anthropogenic
    emissions since pre-industrial times and contribute about 7% of the total mean
    warming.; Reducing emissions from thawing permafrost will reduce the mean extra
    impact of emissions by about US$37 trillion.
  4: Figure 4 shows projections of extra annual economic impacts from permafrost emissions
    from 2000 to 2200, with mean, 5%, and 95% values. Figure 6 shows the influence
    of different input variables (TCR, PTP, EMUC, Emissions Uncertainty, FRT, POW_2)
    on the NPV of the extra impacts from thawing permafrost, measured in US$ trillion.
