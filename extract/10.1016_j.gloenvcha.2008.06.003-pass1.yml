Drivers of Risk:
  1: Higher temperatures, worsening rainfall patterns, water scarcity, increased farming
    on marginal lands, and the frequency of droughts.
  2: Adverse climate change affecting commercial and subsistence farming; Rising temperatures;
    Changes in environmental variables (F, Z, G) on land values, where F is the vector
    of climate variables, Z is the sets of soil classification, and G is the set of
    economic indicators

    \ Summer precipitation, Fall precipitation, Winter precipitation, Spring precipitation,\
    \ Temperature\u2014annual mean, Precipitation\u2014annual mean, Soil vertisols,\
    \ Soil acrisols, Soil arenasols, Soil xerosols, Mean runoff, Irrigated farms (1/0),\
    \ Farm type (large-scale farms (1/0))"
  6: Climate variables such as temperature and precipitation changes, farm systems
    (irrigation vs. dryland, large-scale vs. small-scale), and agro-ecological conditions.
  7: Temperature increases, precipitation changes, soil type, and runoff influence
    crop net revenues.
  8: Temperature and precipitation changes impact crop net revenues across different
    zones and provinces.
  9: "Increased temperatures (1\xB0C increase) and increased precipitation (1 mm/month\
    \ increase)."
  10: Changes in temperature and precipitation under different climate scenarios (CGCM2,
    HadCM3, PCM) for 2050 and 2100.
  11: Temperature increases and precipitation decreases (specifically between 2.3
    and 9.6 degrees Celsius increase and a 0.2% to 0.8% decrease in precipitation
    by 2100).
Highlights:
  1: Crop net revenues expected to fall by as much as 90% by 2100; agriculture sector's
    vulnerability due to dependency on climate variables like temperature and precipitation.
  2: This study extends earlier Ricardian studies by incorporating relevant hydrological
    variables to assess the economic impact of climate change on agriculture in South
    Africa; The estimated Ricardian model is used to predict the range of impacts
    on the agricultural sector under various climate change scenarios.
  5: Long-term mean temperatures indicate that summer periods have the highest temperatures,
    followed by spring and fall, then winter. The highest long-term average rainfall
    per month was experienced in the summer and the lowest in winter. The mean runoff
    is estimated at about 10 mm/month. Irrigated farms had the highest net revenues,
    followed by large-scale farms, small-scale farms, and dryland farms.
  6: Irrigation is highlighted as a significant positive influence on crop net revenues;
    large-scale farms also have higher expected net revenues than small-scale ones.
  7: Higher summer temperatures have a negative effect on crop net revenues. Increased
    precipitation generally increases net revenues, except possibly for small-scale
    farms and during the fall season. Dryland farms are particularly vulnerable to
    changes in temperature.
  8: Increased temperature generally leads to positive annual impacts on crop net
    revenues across zones, except the desert zone.
  9: Small-scale farmers will be more affected than large-scale farmers.
  10: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature can have a positive impact on annual crop\
    \ net revenues for all farms except dryland ones; Rainfall in the early part of\
    \ the summer farming season would be beneficial, while later rainfall would be\
    \ harmful."
  11: Climate change is expected to significantly reduce crop net revenues in South
    Africa, with small-scale farmers being particularly vulnerable. Adaptation can
    potentially reduce these negative effects. The effect of climate change is not
    only in the overall effect (country level) but also in different seasons, different
    farming systems, and different agro-ecological and provincial levels.
Methodology:
  1: Economic impact assessed using a revised Ricardian model with data from farm
    household surveys, long-term climate data, and soil and runoff information.
  2: Ricardian method - a cross-sectional approach that links farm values to climate,
    examining farm performance across different agro-climatic zones; reduced form
    model that examines how the set of exogenous variables, F, Z and G, affect farm
    value; regression of farm values on climate, soil, and other control variables.
  5: A revised Ricardian model is estimated using STATA statistical and econometric
    package using quantile regression (qreg) to correct for heteroscedasticity.  The
    model includes variables like temperature, precipitation, soil type, runoff, irrigation
    and farm type to explain crop net revenue per hectare. Multicollinearity is controlled
    for by dropping problematic variables. The analysis is applicable to cross-sectional
    data in South Africa.
  6: A step-wise approach is used with the inclusion of climate, soils, and hydrology
    variables; different models are employed for various farm types to assess the
    influence on net revenue.
  7: The paper estimates marginal effects of temperature and precipitation on crop
    net revenues using estimated models. The models consider soil variables (acrisols,
    arenosols, vertisols, and xerosols) and hydrology (runoff). Results apply to South
    Africa.
  8: Marginal effects and elasticities on crop net revenues are estimated based on
    temperature and precipitation changes.
  9: The analysis is based on data from South Africa.
  10: Revised Ricardian model is used to assess the economic impacts of climate change
    on crop-farming activities in South Africa.
  11: The study uses climate scenarios for South Africa to predict the impact on crop
    net revenues by 2100. The analysis is performed at the agro-ecological zone and
    provincial levels.
More Notes:
  2: The standard Ricardian model relies on a quadratic formulation of climate. The
    study uses cross-sectional data for the 2002/2003 farming season.
  6: The analysis indicates that temperature effects are non-linear with a hill-shaped
    trend for farming seasons, benefiting crops up to a certain extent before becoming
    detrimental.
  7: The timing of rainfall is important for agricultural activities. Irrigation can
    help reduce the effect of climate variables on farming activities.
  8: Effects on net revenues vary by farming season and location, emphasizing the
    importance of seasonal impacts for policy.
  9: The table provides disaggregated impacts across different agro-ecological zones,
    provinces, and seasons.
  10: The study considers different farming systems (irrigated, dryland, large-scale,
    small-scale) and includes factors like runoff and soil types in the model.
  11: Irrigation is an important policy instrument in controlling the adverse effects
    of climate change. Water scarcity is a concern, necessitating research into heat-tolerant
    and water-stress-resistant crop varieties and animal breeds.

  6: Table 2 provides estimates for the crop farming net revenue based on climate,
    soil, and hydrology variables across different farm systems.
  7: "A 1\xB0C increase in annual temperatures leads to an increase in crop net revenue\
    \ of US$ 80 for the whole country, US$ 191 for irrigated farms, US$ 588 for large-scale\
    \ farms and US$ 60 for small-scale farms; dryland farms will see a fall in their\
    \ net revenues by about US$ 50 per hectare. A 1% increase in temperature will\
    \ lead to 4% increase in net revenues for the whole of South Africa, 7% for irrigated\
    \ farms, 27% for large-scale farms, 4% for small-scale farms, but a fall of 5%\
    \ in net revenues for dryland farms. An annual increase of 1 mm/month of precipitation\
    \ will have a positive effect on net revenues, with the exception of those of\
    \ small-scale farmers."
