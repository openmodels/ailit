Drivers of Risk:
  7: Climate change effects on land or ocean resources, sea level change, ocean warming
    and acidification, weather extremes (storms, cyclones) and sea ice loss, water-related
    hazards (floods and droughts) and water quality deterioration, extreme events
    leading to the breakdown of physical infrastructure
  11: Risk of hazards, exposure to disasters, pre-existing vulnerability, lack of
    infrastructural coping capacity, lack of institutional coping capacity
  13: Climate change impacts on water security, food security, human health, peace,
    human mobility, living standards, critical infrastructure, coastal socioecological
    systems, and terrestrial/ocean ecosystems.
  15: The primary driver of risk is climate change-attributable extreme events.
Highlights:
  1: Financing adaptation options to climate change-related risks to food security,
    human health, and water security are a high near-future priority for minimizing
    losses and damages.
  11: People-centred criteria (magnitude and severity of need) were predominantly
    the top criteria. There is a nuanced interplay between people-centred criteria,
    risk, and vulnerability. The importance of risk factors increases with the forecast
    timeframe.
  13: Risks to water security, food security, and human health are consistently identified
    as the highest priority for adaptation funding. The panel also prioritizes imminent
    risks (e.g., water and food security) over underlying risks (e.g., ecosystem health),
    although the latter can cascade into the former.
  15: Experts prioritize people in need-centric and disaster risk-based criteria over
    governance, rule of law, or socio-economic aspects in humanitarian aid and disaster
    management funding. A consensus suggests the results are an emergent preference
    for the losses and damages sector, raising questions about prioritizing resources
    between immediate crisis response and long-term prevention.
Methodology:
  1: A two-round anonymous Delphi method using global frameworks for a funding allocation
    simulation was employed.
  5: The analysis is performed using the Delphi method to form a consensus among experts
    on prioritizing criteria and options for allocating humanitarian or disaster aid
    funding under climate change scenarios.
  7: The study combined indicators from the short-term/micro INFORM Severity index
    with the long-term/macro INFORM Climate Change Risk as well as the high-level
    and century-encompassing RKRs of IPCC AR6 to explore forward-looking criteria
    and options that are priorities in humanitarian or disaster aid funding. A two-round
    survey was conducted with a panel of experts to prioritize risks. Results from
    round 1 were analyzed and shared with the panel before round 2.
  11: A panel was asked to assess and justify the priority of different criteria related
    to humanitarian needs and risk, measure their confidence, and suggest amendments
    to the survey. The table shows the results of the second round (R2, N2=20).
  13: Expert elicitation/survey (N=20), qualitative synthesis of free-text comments.  Results
    seem applicable to prioritizing adaptation funding in the short to medium term,
    but priorities may shift on longer timescales.
  15: The paper uses a Delphi method to elicit expert preferences on funding allocation
    criteria. The results are applicable to the near future, predominantly days, months,
    or years forward. The methodology attempts to find covariant variables in continuous
    time for general use.
More Notes:
  11: The panellists noted the importance of considering the capacity to cope when
    assessing risk, stating that a disaster does not trigger humanitarian need if
    there is no one living in its area of impact.
  13: The experts are prioritizing based on what is viable to amend or could realistically
    make a difference in the short or medium term; some would want to put everything
    in high priority, and others are rather confident in assessing them out of long-term
    sustainable adaptation design.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  7: Economic impacts across scales, including impacts on GDP, poverty and livelihoods,
    as well as the exacerbating effects of impacts on socio-economic inequality between
    and within countries
  11: Saving livelihoods is mentioned as an outcome connected to humanitarian assistance.
    Risk assessments determine socio-economic impacts of disasters.
  13: Societal destabilization (indirectly linked to macroeconomic outcomes through
    food and water security).
  15: The paper discusses funding allocation for humanitarian aid and disaster risk
    management, implying interest in fiscal outcomes related to these areas. It also
    implicitly discusses the time value of human life.
Quantitative material:
  11: Table 5 presents mean, standard deviation, median, range, and mode of priority
    scores assigned to various risk factors. For example, 'PEOPLE IN NEED' had a mean
    priority score of 3.80.
  13: Mean, standard deviation, median, range, and mode of expert panel ratings of
    the risk associated with different climate change impacts on a scale that is not
    specified on this page.
