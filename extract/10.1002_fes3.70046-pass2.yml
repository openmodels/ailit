Drivers of Risk:
  9: Not applicable
  10: Fluctuations in import and export quantities and values of NUS and wheat.
  11: Heat stress
  13: Heat stress, water scarcity
Highlights:
  9: NUS areas have increased globally but declined in the MENA region since 2018.
    Wheat imports significantly increased, highlighting the region's reliance on wheat.
    The trade balance for NUS and wheat remains negative, with imports outpacing exports.
  10: The trade balance for NUS remained negative between 2018 and 2022, with import
    revenues consistently exceeding export revenues. Wheat imports also exceeded exports
    significantly, contributing to a negative trade balance.
  11: NUS generally exhibit the highest water productivity, with chickpea, cow pea,
    and sorghum leading at approximately 2.5 kg/m3, followed by sesame (2.22 kg/m3).
  13: "Lentil\u2013quinoa and lentil-chickpea relay intercropping consistently outperforms\
    \ wheat monocropping in sustainability indicators. Specifically, lentil\u2013\
    quinoa and lentil-chickpea combinations exhibit lower GHGI while enhancing Protein\
    \ yield."
Methodology:
  9: Analysis of historical trends in NUS cultivation, trade balance, and import/export
    quantities and values.
  10: Analysis of long-term trade data from FAOSTAT (2024).
  11: Comparison of water productivity among neglected and under utilized species
    (NUS) and major crops (wheat, maize, and rice) using data from FAOSTAT (2024),
    Mabhaudhi et al. (2017), and other literature.
  13: Field experimentation in Morocco during 2019/20 and 2020/21 growing seasons
    comparing wheat monocropping with lentil-quinoa and lentil-chickpea relay intercropping
    in rainfed drylands.
More Notes:
  9: The data focuses on the agricultural sector, specifically on neglected and underutilized
    species (NUS) and wheat, but does not directly link these trends to macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes.
  10: The analysis focuses on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. NUS
    include date and olive. Globally, NUS provide more calories than rice or wheat.
    In the MENA region, wheat remains the dominant energy source.
  11: The analysis focuses on the role of neglected and underutilized species (NUS)
    in food security and water productivity in the MENA region and Sub-Saharan Africa
    in the context of heat stress.
  13: The study focuses on relay-intercropping of neglected and underutilized species
    (NUS) such as lentil, chickpea, and quinoa with wheat in rainfed drylands.

  14: This page focuses on non-traditional crops (NUS) in the MENA region and their
    role in food security, water productivity, and nutritional benefits. It does not
    directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, nor does it provide quantitative
    cost-benefit analyses or GDP impacts of national adaptation strategies related
    to climate change.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  9: Not applicable
  10: Trade balance (exports minus imports) of Neglected and Underutilized Species
    (NUS) and wheat.
  11: No relevant information
  13: Sustainability indicators (Greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI)), protein
    yield, total calorie yield, wheat grain yield, total cost, wheat equivalent yield,
    gross margin, water use efficiency.
Quantitative material:
  9: Area under cultivation of Neglected and Underutilized Species (NUS) in Mha for
    various countries in the MENA region between 1961 and 2022. Import and export
    quantities and values of NUS and wheat for the MENA region between 1961 and 2022.
  10: 'Import and export quantities and values for NUS and wheat from 1960 to 2020.
    Trade balance for NUS and wheat (2018-2022): NUS import quantity increased from
    7.71 to 8.13 Mt., while exports grew from 1.99 to 3.87 Mt. Wheat imports decreased
    from 39.29 to 34.78 Mt., while exports slightly declined from 1.61 to 1.34 Mt.'

    crops in the MENA region. Figure 8: Comparison of water productivity among neglected
