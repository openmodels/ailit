Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature, Climate change
  2: Temperature changes, deviations in temperature from historical norms, and precipitation.
  3: Rising temperatures relative to historical norms.
  5: Consistent changes in temperature above or below historical norms.
  7: Temperature change affecting productivity and capital stock
  8: Temperature, weather factors
Highlights:
  1: Estimates of damage through growth effects are generally much larger than those
    through level effects; diverse impact mechanisms and adaptation effects can be
    revealed by changing the time resolution of temperature variables, introducing
    non-linearity into econometrics functions, and specifying temperature deviation;
    combining cross-sectional and panel model would enable us to examine the economic
    impacts at different future times.
  2: Identifies critical differences between growth and level effects of temperature
    on GDP. Summarizes characteristics of impact functions in linear and non-linear
    forms. Categorizes forms of temperature variables used in existing studies. Reviews
    the development of climate econometric models and sorts out the characteristics
    of different model specifications of the temperature-GDP relationship. Identifies
    channels for combining climate econometrics with Integrated Assessment Models
    (IAMs). Illuminates limitations of existing studies and suggests future research
    directions.
  3: Temperature rises only temporarily affect the level of economic output (level
    effect); temperature rise permanently affects economic output growth (growth effect).
    If GDP growth is impacted by temperature changes, at some future time, the output
    will depend on the trajectory of temperature and output up to that time rather
    than just the temperature at that time.
  5: Identification of key temperature thresholds is crucial for developing adaptation
    plans for climate change.
  6: Traditional FE estimators utilized in research with the panel model have assumed
    that climatic variables are strictly exogenous; however, there are the bi-directional
    feedback effects between temperature and economic growth.
  7: Modeling climate impacts as growth effects rather than level effects significantly
    impacts potential economic losses. Incorporating growth shocks into damage assessment
    in an IAM can boost the optimal mitigation rate. Social cost of carbon can be
    much higher (3x) when incorporating empirically calibrated damage functions into
    IAMs.
  8: Linear specifications are suitable for estimating short-run weather impacts but
    biased for long-term impacts without considering adaptation; non-linear panel
    models can reflect both short- and long-term impacts.
Methodology:
  1: Climate econometrics analysis, including growth and level effects, time resolution
    of temperature variables, non-linearity in econometrics functions, temperature
    deviation specification, cross-sectional and panel models.
  2: Climate econometrics, including panel models, to analyze the temperature-GDP
    relationship. Models consider short- and long-run climate impacts and adaptation
    effects. Focus on distinguishing growth and level effects. The analysis compares
    linear and non-linear forms of impact functions. Studies use different temperature
    variables by temporal resolution.
  3: Discusses growth vs. level effects using temperature-GDP relationships, and examines
    different model specifications (linear vs. non-linear).
  5: Temperature bin specification to assess non-linear effects on GDP; requires high-resolution
    data to avoid inaccuracies.
  6: Discusses panel data models, hybrid panel models (long difference approach),
    and dynamic panels with half-panel jackknife FE (HPJ-FE) estimators for analyzing
    climate-economic relationships. It addresses challenges like time-invariant and
    time-varying omitted variables, bi-directional feedback effects between temperature
    and economic growth, and distinguishing between short- and long-term climate impacts.
  7: IAMs (Integrated Assessment Models) are used to model the relationship between
    temperature impacts and physical capital stock or productivity. Also, reduced-form
    temperature-GDP growth nexus
  8: Climate econometrics models; linear and non-linear panel models
More Notes:
  1: The paper reviews literature on climate econometrics analysis of the relationship
    between temperature and GDP to evaluate climate risks and understand economic
    impacts caused by climate change; Climate econometrics is used to parameterise
    impacts in a reduced-form empirical model capturing the connection between climate
    and outcome.
  2: The paper reviews existing literature on the temperature-GDP nexus, identifies
    a lack of consensus on growth and level effects, and suggests incorporating multiple
    model specifications to distinguish these effects across different time scales.
    It emphasizes the need to incorporate climate variability and adaptation patterns
    into models and warns against extrapolating existing empirical relationships without
    accounting for future adaptation.
  3: The premises of the growth and level effects are presented graphically considering
    a period of rising temperatures relative to historical norms.
  5: The temperature trend can cause biased estimation in econometrics if not handled
    properly.
  6: The paper emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between short-run and long-run
    effects because the socio-economic system could be better able to react to long-run
    changes than short-run ones by investing in adaptive responses. Identifying only
    short-term responses to weather variation and only extrapolating the short-run
    effects of weather variation on economic outcomes would also tend to overestimate
    the effects of global warming if future significant adaptation occurs
  7: The paper emphasizes the importance of differentiating between short- and long-run
    effects when assessing adaptation effects.
  8: Meta-analysis approach could produce a damage function that reflects the latest
    empirical findings more fully.
