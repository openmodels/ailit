Drivers of Risk:
  1: Storms, insect outbreaks, salvage logging (supply shocks), rebuilding after storms
    (demand shocks)
  2: Supply shocks (salvage logging after disturbance), demand shocks (changes in
    market conditions of the construction sector).
  4: Demand shocks and supply shocks affecting sawlog and pulpwood markets are analyzed.
  7: Climate change-induced increases in intensity and frequency of forest disturbances
    impacting roundwood market prices and quality.
Highlights:
  1: Disturbances tend to increase the domestic prices of sawlogs, suggesting a shortage
    effect on high-quality wood. For pulpwood, supply shocks tend to decrease pulpwood
    prices. Strategic logging management and international trade are possible resilience
    predictors, but their potential is limited and should not be overestimated.
  2: The study identifies predictors of roundwood price resilience with respect to
    supply and demand shocks and examines how their effect varies across national
    forest-based value chains in Europe.
  4: Demand shocks have a positive association with sawlog prices in multiple countries
    and supply shocks have mixed effects depending on the region.
  7: Price stability in roundwood markets can act as a measure of resilience by moderating
    the effects of oversupply or undersupply due to disturbances.
Methodology:
  1: Econometric analysis focusing on five forest-rich European countries (Austria,
    Czechia, Germany, Finland, and Sweden), applying the theory of price transmission
    and using a set of candidate resilience predictors. Uses annual time series data
    in differenced form on salvage logging, forest products production and trade,
    and roundwood prices.
  2: Time series econometric model for saw milling and pulp milling value chains,
    examining the impact of shocks contingent upon international trade, voluntary
    logging, and changes in roundwood assortment composition.
  4: Analysis is performed using OLS models with interaction terms, testing for stationarity,
    and model selection based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
  7: Time series econometric modeling of forest value-chain resilience across five
    European countries utilizing available data on roundwood markets.
More Notes:
  1: The study assesses the impact of supply and demand shocks on roundwood prices
    in the context of climate change-related natural disturbances in forests.
  2: The study considers the socio-economic landscape and how forest enterprises adapt
    their resilience strategies. Disturbances cause short-term oversupply and price
    reductions, affecting forest owners, while demand shocks cause shortages and price
    spikes, impacting consumers.
  4: Armington elasticities are used as a measure of substitution between domestically
    harvested and imported roundwood, serving as a resilience predictor.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Roundwood prices
  2: Roundwood price stability (as critical for the functioning of forest-based value
    chains).
Quantitative material:
  1: Econometric analysis using annual time series data in differenced form.
