Drivers of Risk:
  1: Historical climate change due to global warming leading to increased heat and
    rainfall extremes.
  2: Human-induced climate change (specifically, the effects of human activities on
    temperature and precipitation).
  3: Changes in temperature, rainfall, and radiation affecting crop yields which in
    turn impact agricultural productivity.
  4: Climate change impacts crop yields by affecting temperature, water availability
    (evapotranspiration), and CO2 levels.
  5: Historical climate change, CO2 concentration levels.
  7: Historical climate change, specifically changes in temperature and rainfall.
  9: Temperature increase, rainfall variations (though rainfall increases may not
    fully compensate for temperature increases), increased evapotranspiration-led
    water deficit, heat stress.
  10: There is an increase in the frequency of heavy rains linked to global warming.
  11: Historical climate change relative to a non-warming counterfactual climate condition
  12: Historical climate change (human influence on climate), specifically changes
    in growing season mean temperature and precipitation
  13: Climate change, specifically increasing temperatures leading to crop yield losses,
    irrespective of rainfall changes; Warming is highest in the north of the Sahel.
Highlights:
  1: Historical climate change has led to significant crop yield losses and economic
    losses in West Africa.
  2: Aims to estimate average crop production losses of millet and sorghum in West
    Africa due to human-induced climate change during 2000-2009 and use the results
    to improve understanding of adaptation costs.
  3: Different modeling concepts aid in assessing uncertainty and consensus in simulated
    yield responses due to future climate change.
  4: The models quantify the human influence on historical crop yields by comparing
    simulations under factual and counterfactual climate scenarios.
  5: Focuses on estimating the impacts of historical climate change on crop yields
    and production losses.
  7: "The simulated impacts on average yields in 2000\u20132009 due to historical\
    \ climate change varied by location and between the two crop models. The CYGMA\
    \ model simulates some positive impacts in the south of West Africa. The models\
    \ have complementarity in assessing climate impacts on yield variability and trends.\
    \ CYGMA accurately reproduces yield trends, while SARRA-H better reproduces year-to-year\
    \ variability."
  9: "Warming above 1\xB0C is associated with yield losses in millet and sorghum;\
    \ increased evapotranspiration-led water deficit is the largest contributing factor\
    \ to yield impact; temperature increase plays a dominant role in estimating climate\
    \ change impacts on crop yields in Africa; CYGMA and SARRA-H lead to crop yield\
    \ losses."
  10: CYGMA model has a relative advantage in capturing yield growth affected by climate
    change.
  11: Presents geographical patterns of average yield impacts associated with historical
    climate change (Figure 5) and estimated impacts on average annual yield and average
    production of millet and sorghum in West Africa (Figure 6)
  12: Historical climate change has significantly impacted millet and sorghum yields
    in West Africa during 2000-2009, with potential yield increases of 11-18% for
    millet and 6-15% for sorghum if human influence on climate were excluded.
  13: Human activities have already had a significant impact on the regional climate
    in the Sahel, with negative consequences for the production of major cereals in
    the region; Production loss estimates offer a sound basis to depict a more specific
    view of the costs of adaptation and investments in adaptation in crop production
    systems in West Africa.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis performed using an ensemble of 100 historical climate simulations with
    atmospheric general circulation model and two process-based crop models (SARRA-H
    and CYGMA).
  2: "Compares factual climate simulations (including human and natural forcing) with\
    \ counterfactual (non-warming) climate simulations using MRI-AGCM3.2. Then two\
    \ crop models (SARRA-H and CYGMA) are used to quantify uncertainty in crop yield\
    \ response. Statistical tests (Student's t-test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) are\
    \ used to assess the robustness of changes between factual and counterfactual\
    \ scenarios. Analysis focuses on West Africa (20\xB0W to 15\xB0E; 4\xB0N to 18\xB0\
    N) during 2000-2009."
  3: The paper uses process-based crop models (SARRA-H and CYGMA) to simulate yield
    responses to future climate change conditions in West Africa.
  4: The study uses crop models SARRA-H and CYGMA, which simulate historical and counterfactual
    crop yields using climate data, to assess the impact of climate change on millet
    and sorghum yields globally.
  5: Crop simulations were performed with and without human influence on climate systems.
    Crop models used were CYGMA and SARRA-H, using datasets like S14FD, MIRCA2000,
    M3-Crops, and HID. The models are applied to factual and counterfactual climate
    scenarios.
  7: "The analysis uses climate simulations (counterfactual and factual) and two crop\
    \ models (CYGMA and SARRA-H) to assess climate impacts on crop yields in West\
    \ Africa (20\xB0W to 15\xB0E; 4\xB0N to 18\xB0N) during 2000-2009. Statistical\
    \ tests (Student's t-test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) are used to assess the\
    \ significance of differences between simulations."
  9: Comparison of FAO reported yields with SARRA-H and CYGMA model simulations for
    millet and sorghum in West Africa (1961-2012); sensitivity analysis with the CYGMA
    model.
  10: "The study examines climate simulations during the decade 2000\u20132009 and\
    \ relates findings to climate impacts on the Sahel."
  11: Crop simulations comparing factual and counterfactual climate conditions; Harvested
    area weighting used to compute country and West Africa average yield impacts;
    Box plots indicating mean, 25-75%, and 5-95% confidence intervals derived from
    ensemble members of the crop simulation
  12: Two independent crop models (SARRA-H and CYGMA) were used to assess crop production
    losses. The models simulate yield response to temperature and precipitation, with
    differences in how technological improvements and agronomic adjustments are considered.
  13: Crop models (CYGMA and SARRA-H) are used to estimate yield impacts of climate
    change on millet production in Niger during the decade 2000-2009, relative to
    a counterfactual climate condition; The simulated maximum yield impact is limited
    to -100% of the yield in the factual climate condition to avoid unrealistically
    large production loss estimates.
More Notes:
  5: The study uses socioeconomic data from the World Bank and FAOSTAT databases.
  7: Comparison with FAO yield statistics is difficult due to data imputation and
    lack of historical management information.
  11: Analysis focuses on the period 2000-2009 and uses two simulation methodologies
    (Cygma and SARRA-H) to estimate the impact of historical climate change on millet
    and sorghum yields in West Africa.
  12: The SARRA-H model showed its relative advantage in capturing yield anomalies,
    which are mainly driven by seasonal climate variability.
  13: Caution is necessary when interpreting the crop simulation results because the
    quality of the reported data in the studied region is not as high as that in developed
    countries; The authors used the harvested area data from 2000 obtained from the
    M3-Crops dataset throughout the studied period.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Financial production losses due to human-induced climate warming in millet and
    sorghum production in West Africa.
  5: Impact on annual production of crops at a country level (USD), simulated country
    annual yield impact relative to the simulated average factual yield in the baseline
    period (ratio).
  7: Simulated impacts on average crop yields (millet and sorghum) in 2000-2009.
  9: Crop yield losses in West Africa due to climate change.

  12: Crop production losses of millet and sorghum in West Africa
  13: "Crop production losses due to climate change have likely led to important financial\
    \ losses in several Sahelian countries; Climate change impact on millet production\
    \ in Niger cost between 0.47 and 0.54 billion USD per year during 2000\u20132009."
Quantitative material:
  1: "Average annual production losses in West Africa (2000-2009) associated with\
    \ historical climate change estimated as 2.33\u20134.02 billion USD for millet\
    \ and 0.73\u20132.17 billion USD for sorghum."
  2: Uses crop price data to quantify the financial production losses.
  5: Presents equations for calculating yield impacts at grid-cell and country levels
    and production impacts at the country level.
  7: Table 4 presents quantitative data on user-relevant climate indices (Annual Mean
    Temperature, Annual Rainfall, Annual Rainy Days, Heavy Rainfall Events, Very Heavy
    Rainfall Events, Rainfall Intensity, Very Hot Days, Onset Day) under counterfactual
    and factual climate conditions, along with differences and statistical significance.  For
    example, it shows a 1.0 degree Celsius difference in annual mean temperature,
    and a 0.9% difference in annual rainfall.  It also shows that Very Hot Days increased
    841% between counterfactual and factual climate conditions.
  9: "Correlation coefficients between reported and simulated yield data; impact of\
    \ temperature changes on millet and sorghum yields (warming above 1\xB0C associated\
    \ with yield losses); mitigation of warming impacts with increasing rainfall (-59%\
    \ and -26% for decreasing and increasing rainfall, respectively); CO2 fertilization\
    \ and technological improvement are insufficient to offset heat and water stress."
  11: Estimated impacts on average annual yield and average production of millet and
    sorghum in 2000-2009 for selected major crop-producing countries in West Africa,
    expressed as the difference between factual and counterfactual crop simulations;
    Range of simulated yield change was limited to the interval from -100% to +100%
  12: "Average crop yield across West Africa for the decade 2000\u20132009 would have\
    \ been 11% to 18% higher for millet and 6% to 15% higher for sorghum if human\
    \ influence on climate was excluded."
  13: "Climate change impact on millet production in Niger cost between 0.47 and 0.54\
    \ billion USD per year during 2000\u20132009; Average GDP of Niger was 3.4 billion\
    \ USD during the same decade; GDP share of agriculture in Niger is approximately\
    \ 35%; Production share of millet in agricultural GDP accounts for 50%; Ensemble\
    \ average yield impact for millet ranged from -19% (CYGMA) to -22% (SARRA-H) relative\
    \ to the counterfactual climate condition."
