Drivers of Risk:
  1: Regional climate variations (temperature and precipitation) impact agricultural
    productivity.
  2: Climate patterns (temperature and precipitation anomalies), extreme weather events
    (droughts, floods), and exogenous shocks (energy crisis, policy fluctuations).
  3: Temperature anomalies (TA) and precipitation anomalies (PR) by period and season,
    shift to higher sensitivity to climate variability.
  4: Temperature and precipitation changes in specific seasons and regions of the
    US; Warmer winter temperatures leading to snow melt and depleted soil moisture;
    Increased summer rainfall in grazing lands
  5: Regional climate variations are linked to variability in agricultural Total Factor
    Productivity (TFP).
  6: Climate change, specifically warmer summers in the Midwest, warmer autumns in
    the Southwest, warmer springs in the Southwest, warmer summers in California and
    Nevada, and decreasing amount and increasing variability of summer precipitation
    in the transition zone between the Corn and Cotton Belts.
  7: Climate indices (temperature and precipitation anomalies in specific regions
    and seasons) are identified as drivers of TFPC.
  9: Temperature and precipitation changes impact Total Factor Productivity (TFP)
    and agricultural productivity.
  10: Climate change, specifically warming trends (increased autumn, spring, and summer
    temperatures) and changes in precipitation patterns, are the main drivers of TFP
    loss.
  11: Increased irrigation use, evolving climate sensitivity with negative impacts,
    and regulatory effects not accounted for, impacting TFP.
  13: Temperature and precipitation changes are the key drivers of risk analyzed.
Highlights:
  1: The aggregate effects of regional climate trends on TFP have been outweighed
    by improvements in technology, but projected climate change could cause significant
    TFP decline.
  2: Climate has been a significant factor in explaining the variability of TFP. TFP
    growth rates have been highly variable since the 1970s.
  3: TFPC became much more sensitive to climate between 1981-2010 than 1951-1980;
    summer productivity growth was associated with cooler temperatures over the US
    agricultural heartland (Midwest, Northeast, mid-Atlantic, and surrounding areas),
    but with warmer temperatures in California and its border areas.
  4: Climate dependence of US agricultural TFPC significantly increased after 1980;
    Agricultural productivity has become more sensitive to climate in recent years;
    Changes in climate correlations suggest impacts of climate on TFPC became negative
    over time in many areas.
  5: TFP growth in US agriculture has largely been sustained by technological gains
    despite small net losses due to climate trends.
  6: US agricultural TFP is projected to decline continuously, with faster rates after
    ~2025, due to climate change; the largest contributor to the decline is projected
    warmer summers in the Midwest.
  7: Technological advances in US agricultural productivity growth were considerably
    enhanced in 1981-2010 compared to 1951-1980.
  9: "TFP sensitivity to climate increased significantly from 1981\u20132010 compared\
    \ to the 1951-1980 period, with summer temperatures showing the largest correlations."
  10: The future climate penalty reduces TFP at greater rates than it has grown in
    recent decades, and the rate of loss increases significantly over time. Productivity
    appears to be significantly more sensitive to climate than previous studies have
    shown for yield. TFP loss may be higher than yield loss because it reflects the
    added costs of maintaining yield under less beneficial climate conditions.
  11: Regulatory and policy impacts on TFP and the role of improved technology or
    practices in potential adaptation.
  13: Temperature and precipitation are correlated with TFPC; crops make up the majority
    of US agricultural value, with livestock decreasing and farm-related goods and
    services increasing in importance in recent decades.
Methodology:
  1: Multivariate regression model predicting the growth of agricultural TFP based
    on its historical relationship with regional climate indices. Objective, upscaling
    approach to quantify the effects of regional climate variations on national TFP.
  2: Correlation analysis of national TFPC with seasonal and geographic distributions
    of climate variables (temperature and precipitation anomalies) to identify statistically
    significant relationships. A multivariate regression model is developed to predict
    national aggregate agricultural TFP growth. Data from 1951-2010 is used to examine
    historical trends.
  3: Examined the geographic distribution of 30-year correlations to identify key
    areas where regional climate indices significantly affect national TFPC; comparisons
    of correlations are given in National Percentages of Significant Correlations
    and Fig. S1.
  4: Regression models are developed for two periods (1951-1980 and 1981-2010) to
    capture TFPC-climate relationships, using seasonal temperature and precipitation
    averages over 10 regions; Running correlation analysis over 20-year periods; Model
    simulations are compared to historical records; Bootstrapping is used to assess
    model uncertainty.
  5: Analysis involves modeling TFP responses to past climate variations and using
    model 2 for future projections under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
  6: Uses Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations for RCP4.5
    and RCP8.5 to project changes to climate indices; performs factor analysis based
    on projected changes in regional climate indices to determine key contributors
    to future US TFP declines; correlates US Department of Agriculture's national-level
    TFP estimates for 1948-2011 with climate variables; uses regression model to estimate
    the relationship between climate and productivity.
  7: Bootstrap sampling is used to assess the robustness of the model and quantify
    regression model uncertainty.
  9: Analysis focuses on correlations between temperature variables (TA, TN, TM) and
    TFP across grid regions for different decades, using historical climate data and
    CMIP5 climate simulations for projections.
  10: The analysis uses a TFPC model representing observed relationships between the
    US agricultural economy and climate variations to project future productivity
    change, treating past relationships as an analog. Regression-based uncertainty
    is also incorporated.
  11: "A lasso regression analysis was performed to minimize overfitting in stepwise\
    \ regression for evaluating climate index effects on TFP, applied to data from\
    \ 1981\u20132010 and 1951\u20131980."
  13: The study uses correlation analysis to assess the relationship between TFPC
    and climate variables (temperature and precipitation) across different 20-year
    subperiods. It also tracks changes in the contributions of different agricultural
    sectors to total value over time.
More Notes:
  2: The study hypothesizes that climate influences agricultural TFP, traditionally
    attributed to technological improvement. The analysis focuses on the relationship
    between interannual climate variations and TFPC rather than TFP itself.
  3: Warmer autumns in Texas and across the Northeast through the Midwest and mid-Atlantic
    regions were associated with higher measured agricultural productivity in 1951-1980;
    cooler springs in Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and the coastal regions of California
    and New Mexico were more productive in 1951-1980.
  4: The transition zone between the Corn and Cotton Belts is particularly vulnerable
    due to its dependence on rainfall for grazing lands; Crop production is generally
    more sensitive to adverse weather than livestock production; The page includes
    figures visually depicting climate correlation patterns and measured vs. simulated
    TFPC.
  5: Projected significant climate changes include increased warming, decreased water
    availability, and enhanced extremes in crop-producing areas, affecting future
    agricultural productivity.
  6: The model describes ~70% of measured TFPC variance. The modeled TFP decline represents
    the penalty arising solely from projected climate changes. The model treats technological
    advances, agricultural practices, and long-term factors such as CO2 fertilization
    as a constant.
  7: Strong cross-correlations between climate indices can lead to some indices being
    excluded from the models.
  10: The model's applicability may decrease as future climate anomalies exceed the
    magnitude of historical anomalies, potentially affecting projections in later
    years. The analysis accounts for changes in livestock and agriculture-related
    goods and services in addition to crop yields.

Quantitative material:
  1: TFP could fall to pre-1980 levels by 2050.
  2: US agricultural output grew at an average rate of 1.50% per year from 1948 to
    2011.
  3: "Significant correlations between regional climate indices and national TFPC\
    \ are statistically insignificant between \xB10.361."
  4: Model 1 (1951-1980) explains almost 50% of TFPC variance; Model 2 (1981-2010)
    explains around 70% of TFPC variance; From 1979 to 2008, more than 60% of yield
    variability can be explained by climate variability; Correlation coefficients
    (R) and p-values for models; Variance explained by regression, residual, and total
    variance for each period.
  5: Calculated a net TFP loss of 0.0003846 per year from climate trends, offset by
    technological gain of 0.014865 per year.
  6: Climate penalty will reduce TFP by ~2.84% per year under RCP4.5 and 4.34% per
    year under RCP8.5 from 2010 to 2040; climate penalty will cause TFP to lose, by
    ~2035, all of the gains achieved from 1981 to 2010 under RCP4.5; models project
    US agricultural TFP will drop to pre-1980s levels by ~2040 or earlier; 90% of
    models project this drop-off to occur by 2043 and 2051 for RCP8.5 and RCP4.5,
    respectively; all gains in US agricultural productivity during 1981-2010 will
    likely be canceled by a climate penalty before ~2050.
  7: Impacts from the seven climate indices contribute approximately 38.91%, 14.41%,
    5.82%, 4.90%, 4.41%, 1.60%, and 0.36% of the total variance explained.
  9: The percentage of significant correlations between climate variables and TFP
    are provided for different decades, indicating changes in climate sensitivity
    over time.
  10: Under RCP4.5, the mean TFP loss is projected at ~2.84% per year through 2040,
    with a range of 1.75% to 5.19%. Under RCP8.5, the mean loss rate is 4.34% per
    year, with a range of 2.52% to 13.32%. These rates increase significantly over
    time.
  11: Lasso regression analysis outputs coefficients for climate indices, indicating
    minimal contributions to total variance.
  13: The study presents quantitative data on the percentage of grids with significant
    temperature and precipitation correlations with TFPC, as well as the percentage
    of total value contributed by different agricultural sectors (crops, livestock,
    farm-related) from 1951-2001.
