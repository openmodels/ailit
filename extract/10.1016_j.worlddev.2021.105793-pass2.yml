  26: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: 1970 cyclone in Bangladesh
  4: Exposure to the 1970 cyclone, the 1971 war, and the 1974 famine; poor environmental
    conditions during the prenatal and neonatal periods
  6: The 1970 cyclone in Bangladesh.
  7: Severe monsoon floods, market failures and price speculation in the food-grains
    market.
  9: The 1970 cyclone in Bangladesh and its long-term effects on affected regions
    and cohorts.
  10: The 1970 cyclone is the primary climate-related shock being analyzed. The 1971
    war and 1974 famine are considered as contemporary events with potential cross-effects.
  13: Exposure to the 1970 cyclone in Bangladesh, specifically severe exposure in
    Barisal and Noakhali regions and mild exposure in neighboring regions, as well
    as the 1971 war and the 1974 famine.
  15: Exposure to disasters, especially in rural areas, due to lack of amenities (healthcare,
    schooling, employment).
  21: The note at the bottom of the table indicates that the cyclone sample includes
    1,059 valid observations, suggesting that cyclone exposure is a driver of risk.
  22: Cyclone Region 1 and Cyclone Region 2
  23: Cyclone, War, Famine
  24: Cyclones are the primary shock being investigated.
  27: "Placebo Cyclone Cohort \xD7 Cyclone Region 1 and Placebo Cyclone Cohort \xD7\
    \ Cyclone Region 2"
  35: Various natural disasters affecting Bangladesh, such as droughts, earthquakes,
    epidemics, extreme temperatures, floods, landslides, and storms.
  37: Cyclone exposure, War Cohort, Famine Cohort, and interactions between these
    variables and geographic region (Region 1, Region 2).
Highlights:
  1: Children surviving the cyclone experience significant health, schooling, and
    consumption adversities in adulthood, with lower probabilities of good health
    and primary schooling, and lower durations of good health, schooling and consumption.
    These adversities are heightened among rural and less-educated households.
  4: Rural poor households experience heightened long-term adversities from childhood
    exposure to disasters; schooling has mitigating effects on these outcomes; government
    investments benefiting the rural poor (education, infrastructure) might have remedial
    influences on the harms of a disaster.
  6: The 1970 cyclone resulted in widespread loss of life and property, with significant
    impact on coastal regions like Noakhali and Barisal.
  13: Severe exposure to the 1970 cyclone had significant long-term adverse effects
    on health, schooling, solvency and per-capita expenditure for cohorts in the Barisal
    and Noakhali regions born between 1969 and 1971. Mild exposure to the 1970 cyclone
    did not have significant long-term adverse effects on health or schooling outcomes.
  15: Rural households experience greater adversity from disasters due to a lack of
    infrastructure, affecting long-term welfare of children; parental education does
    not show a significant mitigating effect.
  22: The analysis aims to test the parallel trends assumption, which is a key assumption
    for causal inference, particularly in difference-in-differences designs.
  23: Exposure to the 1970 cyclone induces long-term health and schooling adversities.
    The table presents estimates from regressions of whether exposure to the 1970
    cyclone induces long-term health and schooling adversities, according to the empirical
    specification (2).
  24: Cyclones have differential impacts on health, schooling, and consumption outcomes
    depending on rural location and parental schooling. Rural areas and individuals
    with less-educated parents may experience more negative impacts from cyclones,
    especially in specific regions.
  25: The table presents estimates of the impact of cyclone exposure on illness-free
    total life-years.
  27: Some placebo cyclone cohorts have statistically significant effects on health,
    schooling, and consumption outcomes, suggesting potential issues with the identification
    strategy in the main analysis.
  35: No relevant information
  37: Cyclone exposure has significant negative effects on consumption outcomes (Solvent
    and Ln(Expenditure)) in some specifications, particularly when interacted with
    Region 2 and/or cohort variables. War and famine cohorts also have impacts.
Methodology:
  1: Uses childhood exposures to the 1970 cyclone as natural experiments, hypothesizing
    that greater exposure leads to poorer adult outcomes.
  4: Separation of the net impacts of the 1970 cyclone from other contemporary adverse
    events using controls for confounding effects
  6: No relevant information
  9: The analysis employs an identification strategy exploiting variations in timing
    and geography of a 1970 cyclone, using a model that interacts cyclone region dummies
    and cohort dummies, controlling for household and regional level variables.
  10: Heckman selection models are used to correct for sample selection bias when
    limiting the estimating sample to agricultural households. The long-term effects
    of the 1970 cyclone are estimated, controlling for cross-effects of other events
    (war, famine) and incorporating selection into agriculture using agricultural
    landholding.
  13: Regression analysis (equation 2) is used to estimate the long-term effects of
    the 1970 cyclone on health and schooling outcomes for cohorts born between 1964
    and 1980, using data from cyclone-affected and control regions. The analysis controls
    for the 1971 war and the 1974 famine.
  21: The analysis considers birth cohorts 1964-80 and excludes Chittagong, CHT and
    Dhaka regions. It uses summary statistics as part of its methods.
  22: "Regression analysis is used to investigate the parallel trends assumption by\
    \ regressing outcome variables on cyclone region indicators. The regression equation\
    \ is \U0001D466\U0001D456 = \U0001D6FC0 + \u2211\U0001D457=1 to 2 \U0001D717\U0001D457\
    \U0001D445\U0001D457 + \U0001D716\U0001D456, where Rj represents cyclone regions.\
    \ Standard errors are clustered at the district level. The analysis is restricted\
    \ to the estimating samples used in Table 3 (of the source paper)."
  23: The analysis uses regression models to estimate the long-term impacts of exposure
    to the 1970 cyclone on health, schooling, and consumption, controlling for year
    of birth, subdivision/thana of birth, and survey year. Standard errors are clustered
    at the district level.
  24: The study uses regression analysis to estimate the impact of cyclone exposure
    on various outcomes, considering interactions with rural location and parental
    schooling. Standard errors are clustered at the district level. The analysis follows
    an 'empirical specification (4)' that includes additional interactions. Results
    are applicable at the national level (potentially for the country the study is
    covering, implied, not stated). Results are from 'Tables A.4 and A.5.'
  25: Regression analysis based on empirical specification (2) with control variables,
    year fixed effects (FE), Thana FE, and HIES FE.
  27: Placebo regressions based on empirical specification (1) excluding ALF due to
    data unavailability before 1964 and with selection into agriculture. Standard
    errors clustered at the district level. Statistical significance at 1%, 5% and
    10% levels. Includes control variables, Year FE, Thana FE, and HIES FE.
  35: Data generated from EM-DAT database as of April 28, 2020.
  37: The analysis uses a regression framework (Eq. (1) and Eq. (2)) with fixed effects
    for year (Year FE) and location (Thana FE) to estimate the impact of various factors
    on Health, Schooling, and Consumption outcomes. The regressions consider interaction
    effects between Cyclone exposure and other cohort and region variables.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on individual-level impacts rather than macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes. It suggests public programs benefiting females and the poor, and development
    of healthcare and schooling infrastructure, as protective measures.
  4: This paper focuses on the long-term effects of the 1970 cyclone across different
    regions of Bangladesh, unlike previous studies that focused on immediate impacts
    or specific regions and events.
  6: Mentions the 1971 war and 1974 famine as part of an exceptional period (1970-1974)
    but focuses on the 1970 cyclone on this page.
  7: This page focuses on the effects of Cyclone Bhola and the 1974 famine in Bangladesh
    but does not provide a quantitative assessment of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes,
    adaptation costs, or benefits at a national level. It does discuss long-term individual-level
    outcomes such as lower educational attainment, employment opportunities and income,
    however.
  13: The specification (1) underestimates the adversities of cyclone exposure.
  15: Location (rural vs. urban) is used as a proxy for availability of amenities;
    the definition of urban is mostly statistical, with some overlap in agricultural
    activities.
  21: The dependent variables 'Healthy', 'Health', 'Educated' and 'Schooling' could
    be used as proxy variables for productivity, which in turn has macroeconomic relevance.
  22: The R-squared values are very low, suggesting that the cyclone region indicators
    explain very little of the variation in the outcome variables. Statistical significance
    is indicated by asterisks, but none of the coefficients for Cyclone Region 1 or
    Cyclone Region 2 on 'Solvent' and 'Ln(Expenditure)' are statistically significant
    at the 10% level based on the reported standard errors.
  23: "The table refers to definitions of outcome variables in Table 2 and Section\
    \ 3.3, and shock regions and cohorts in Table 1. Detailed results are appended\
    \ in Table A.3. The analysis focuses on the long-term impacts of these shocks,\
    \ implying a long-term time horizon for the results. The coefficients of (Cyclone\
    \ Cohort \xD7 Cyclone Region 1) and (Cyclone Cohort \xD7 Cyclone Region 2) are\
    \ parameters of interest."
  24: The dependent variable 'Solvent' is not fully defined, but seems to be related
    to financial stability. The analysis is conducted at the individual or household
    level, and the results are coefficients from regressions, not direct macroeconomic
    or fiscal aggregates.
  25: Standard errors are reported in parentheses. Statistical significance levels
    are indicated by ***, ** and * representing 1%, 5% and 10% levels, respectively.
    Detailed results are appended in Table A.6.
  27: The purpose of this table is a placebo test, designed to test the robustness
    of the main results. It uses placebo cyclone events to see if they also correlate
    with outcomes. Significant effects in the placebo test would suggest that the
    main results might be spurious. Detailed results are appended in Table A.8.
  35: Focuses on historical natural disaster data in Bangladesh, which can inform
    risk assessment but lacks direct analysis of macroeconomic or fiscal impacts.
  37: The analysis examines the impact of cyclone exposure, war, and famine on various
    socio-economic indicators, including health, schooling, and consumption. The interaction
    terms between cyclone exposure and region/cohort variables suggest that the impact
    of cyclones varies depending on geographic location and historical events. Location,
    Gender, Parental Schooling, ALF, Age and Age-Squared are used as control variables.
No relevant information:
  41: This table focuses on the impact of cyclones, war, and famine on individual
    health outcomes (Ln(Health)), not macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. It does not
    provide quantitative information or analysis directly related to the costs and
    benefits of national-level adaptation strategies. Therefore, it does not contain
    relevant information for the specified categories.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  4: Long-term economic impacts on households across Bangladesh; long-term adversities
    for rural poor households; impacts on life expectancy, height, and cognitive ability
  6: No relevant information
  7: Increased prices of essential commodities, spike in unemployment, reduced purchasing
    power.
  13: No relevant information
  15: Health, schooling, and consumption outcomes.
  21: The study uses 'Solvent' (1 if solvent and 0 if otherwise) and 'Expenditure'
    (Monthly household per-capita expenditure, taka) as outcome variables, which are
    indirectly related to macroeconomic outcomes.
  22: Consumption outcomes, specifically 'Solvent' and 'Ln(Expenditure)'
  23: No relevant information
  24: Consumption outcomes are considered, specifically 'Solvent' (likely indicating
    solvency or financial stability) and 'Ln(Expenditure)' (log of expenditure), which
    can relate to economic activity.
  25: Ln(Health) defined as the log of illness-free total life-years.
  27: Health outcomes (Healthy, Ln(Health)), Schooling outcomes (Educated, Ln(Schooling)),
    Consumption outcomes (Solvent, Ln(Expenditure))

  37: Consumption outcomes, measured as Solvent (a binary solvency indicator) and
    Ln(Expenditure).
Quantitative material:
  1: No relevant information
  6: Total mortality was more than 300,000 people, and nearly four million people
    were directly affected. The estimated total damage was $86.4 million in 1970 U.S.
    Dollars, equivalent to $450 million in 2006.
  7: "The 1974 famine caused an estimated 0.45\u20131.5 million deaths through starvation\
    \ and diseases."
  13: 1969-71 cohorts from severely affected regions have 14.9 percentage points lower
    probability of good health during their adulthood and 53.6% lower duration of
    good health over their entire lifetime. They also have 21.8 percentage points
    lower probability of completing at least 5th grade of schooling and 49% lower
    years of schooling. Similarly, they have 12.5 percentage points lower probability
    of solvency and 26.5% lower per-capita expenditure.
  15: Rural household heads born during 1969-71 in severely affected regions have
    60.8 percentage points lower probability of completing at least 5th grade of schooling;
    urban counterparts also have 117% higher years of schooling.
  21: The table provides summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and
    maximum values) for 'Solvent' and 'Expenditure', potentially allowing for quantitative
    analysis of the impact of climate-related events like cyclones on these economic
    outcomes.
  22: Coefficients and standard errors are provided for the impact of Cyclone Region
    1 and Cyclone Region 2 on 'Solvent' and 'Ln(Expenditure'). For Cyclone Region
    1, the coefficient for 'Solvent' is -0.040 (0.037) and for 'Ln(Expenditure)' it
    is -0.073 (0.054). For Cyclone Region 2, the coefficient for 'Solvent' is -0.017
    (0.040) and for 'Ln(Expenditure)' it is 0.030 (0.078).
  23: Yes, the table provides regression coefficients and standard errors for the
    impact of cyclone, war, and famine cohorts, and their interaction with cyclone
    regions, on health, schooling, and consumption outcomes.
  24: The table presents regression coefficients and standard errors showing the impact
    of interacting rural location and parental schooling with cyclone exposure on
    health, schooling, and consumption outcomes. For example, rural location and exposure
    to a cyclone in Region 1 is associated with a statistically significant negative
    impact on being solvent (-0.334) and the log of expenditure (-0.393).
  25: "Coefficients and standard errors for 'Cyclone Cohort \xD7 Cyclone Region 1'\
    \ and 'Cyclone Cohort \xD7 Cyclone Region 2' at the 25th and 75th percentiles\
    \ are reported. Number of observations is also reported."
  27: Coefficients and standard errors for the impact of placebo cyclone cohorts on
    health, schooling, and consumption outcomes; R-squared values for each regression
  35: Historical data on disaster events in Bangladesh from 1900-2019 including the
    number of events, total deaths, total affected, and total damage (some in thousands
    of US$).
  37: The table presents regression coefficients and standard errors for the impact
    of Cyclone, War Cohort, and Famine Cohort on Health, Schooling, and Consumption
    outcomes. Significance levels are indicated by *, **, and ***.
