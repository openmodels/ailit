  14: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Severe winter weather disasters (dzud), combined with other environmental or
    socio-economic stresses and changes; climate change leading to increased frequency
    and magnitude of dzud.
  3: combined effects of climate change, increasing dzud frequency, economic reforms
    and market volatility, and weak institutions for pasture management
  4: Severe winter disasters (dzud), temperature increase, precipitation decline,
    streamflow decline.
  5: Drought, insufficient water sources, extreme cold, deep snow, lack of hay stores,
    inadequate preparation for winter, lack of hand fodder, failure to set aside reserved
    winter/spring pastures, institutional arrangements not in place to effectively
    manage cross-boundary mobility of otor herders, lack of knowledge about how to
    use supplemental feed, poorly prepared winter shelters and bedding grounds, incoming
    otor herders.
  7: Dzud weather (snowfalls, temperature), Dzud type (white or hoofed dzud), Incoming
    Otor Herds, Forage conditions, Animal condition, Availability and use of forage
    and hay reserves, Adequate shelter and cover, Household's herd size, Natural features
    of each soum, Institutional factors (effectiveness of local government), Presence
    of formal collective action organizations.
  8: Dzud (severe winter disaster), specifically high livestock mortality during the
    dzud.
  9: Dzud events (severe winter disasters); climate exposure (weather conditions),
    sensitivity (preparedness), adaptive capacity (coping mechanisms); influx of otor
    herders (migrant herders) creating a 'hoofed dzud'; ineffective government response.
  10: Severe winter disasters (dzud) and reliance on aid distribution.
  13: Dzud is a recurrent natural disaster in Mongolia that interacts with economic
    shocks, institutional transformations, and climate change.
  14: Climate disasters (dzud), land fragmentation, land privatization, nationalization,
    poorly designed common pool resource management policies, disaster relief policies
    with perverse incentives.
  15: Cross-boundary and cross-level dynamics related to pastureland governance; Reliance
    on government and donor aid; Lack of individual responsibility for dzud preparedness;
    Inadequate information distribution (weather, forage, market forecasts); Insufficient
    access to technology and infrastructure; Lack of appropriate policy and economic
    incentives; Poor coordination among actors within and across levels and sectors;
    Ineffective disaster management plans; Donor programs and government policies
    that do not emphasize strengthening adaptive capacity at the community level;
    Lack of clear yet flexible policies to guide pastureland governance; Lack of capacity
    to implement pastureland governance
Highlights:
  1: Vulnerability to dzud is a complex social-ecological phenomenon and a function
    of interacting physical, biological, socio-economic, and institutional factors;
    Cross-level dynamics increase vulnerability to dzud; Relief aid may contribute
    to long-term dependence syndromes, social disparities, and lack of initiative.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Cross-boundary and cross-level dynamics increase vulnerability to severe winter
    disasters (dzud) in Mongolia (mentioned in citation, but not elaborated on this
    page).
  5: Even communities and households that are relatively well prepared in terms of
    animal condition, stored hay and grazing reserves, can be extremely vulnerable
    if institutional arrangements are not in place to effectively manage cross-boundary
    mobility of otor herders. Undur Ulaan illustrates how high sensitivity to dzud
    due to lack of preparation, absence of organized collective action and weak government
    support, as well as the more chronic effects of a drying climate and disappearing
    water sources, led to increased vulnerability to winter disaster. A crisis can
    motivate informal cooperation, raise awareness and influence herder attitudes
    about future herd management.
  7: Poor households lost a significantly higher proportion of their livestock compared
    to mid-level and wealthy herders.
  8: Community-based rangeland management organizations (Jinst and Ikhtamir) had lower
    sensitivity to dzud due to better preparedness and pasture management.
  9: Emergency aid was often too small to make an impact on individual households
    or was not provided at the time it was needed or was the wrong type of aid; lack
    of coordination between local government and aid organizations was a problem;
    concerns about equity and transparency in distribution of targeted aid, and perverse
    incentives creating aid dependency; Undur Ulaan appears to be the most vulnerable
    of the four case study sites due to high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity.
  10: A significant minority of herders planned to move to soum centers or Ulaanbaatar
    or seek supplementary livelihoods, with some intending to work in the mining sector.
    There is emerging evidence of social learning and adaptive behavior at the community
    scale, such as community hay reserves and pasture management plans.
  13: Herders can learn from dzud experiences and with appropriate support, can use
    this opportunity to make adaptive changes that increase resilience to future shocks.
    There is a need to reduce livestock numbers, improve animal quality, and enhance
    collective action.
  15: Four primary policy recommendations are provided for government and donors to
    reduce vulnerability to dzud. These include promoting increased individual responsibility
    for dzud preparedness and reducing reliance on government and donor aid; improving
    coordination and cooperation among actors within and across levels and sectors;
    emphasizing strengthening adaptive capacity at the community level; and implementing
    clear yet flexible policies to guide pastureland governance across multiple levels.
Methodology:
  1: In-depth case studies in two mountain-steppe and two Gobi desert-steppe districts
    in Mongolia, using focus groups, key informant interviews, a household survey,
    and photovoice.
  3: case studies of dzud impacts and responses in four soum
  4: Household surveys with stratified random sampling based on participatory wealth
    ranking, photovoice, social capital indices (trust/reciprocity and perceptions
    of leaders/organizations), communication network indices, data analysis using
    SPSS 17. Data collected from 2009-2010.
  5: Uses Sheep Forage Units (SFU) to measure herd loss. Student's t-tests comparing
    percent of herd lost for households that did and did not undertake each dzud preparation
    or response method. Multiple regression to assess the relationship between percent
    of herd lost and continuous explanatory variables. ANOVA to assess whether percent
    herd losses varied among wealth groups.
  7: The study utilizes interviews, photovoice, and statistical analysis to assess
    vulnerability to dzud in Mongolia. The results are applicable to understanding
    the household-level and community-level drivers of sensitivity to dzud in the
    specific study sites.
  8: Household surveys in 2009, interviews with herders and local officials, focus
    groups.
  9: Case study analysis of four soums in Mongolia (Undur Ulaan, Bayanstagaan, Ikhtamir,
    Jinst) using household surveys and interviews with soum officials; analysis of
    emergency aid distribution and its impacts.
  10: Survey data collected from herder households in selected soum in Mongolia following
    a dzud (severe winter disaster) in 2009-2010; focus groups conducted with herders.
  13: Four case studies were used to observe how past dzuds contributed to building
    community resilience. Focus group, photovoice and survey data were used to illustrate
    the need for change.
  15: Analysis of the sources of dzud vulnerability, leading to policy recommendations.
More Notes:
  1: The study recommends policies that promote individual responsibility for disaster
    preparedness, greater cooperation and communication, sustained investment in building
    local capacity for collective action, and effective cross-level institutions to
    manage pastoral movements and pastures.
  3: The paper analyzes the impacts of the 2009-2010 dzud disaster in Mongolia and
    makes policy recommendations for future resilience-building.
  4: Study sites include mountain steppe (Ikhtamir, Undur Ulaan) and desert steppe
    (Jinst, Bayantsagaan) ecological zones in Mongolia. Donor projects related to
    pasture and risk management are identified.
  5: The study uses case studies of different soums (districts) in Mongolia (Ikhtamir,
    Undur Ulaan, Jinst) to analyze vulnerability and adaptive capacity related to
    dzuds (severe winter disasters).
  7: The paper identifies key factors influencing household sensitivity to dzud, including
    animal condition, forage availability, shelter, and herd size. It highlights the
    impact of livestock loss on household income, consumption, and nutritional status,
    as well as social and cultural obligations.
  8: Institutional factors and collective action at the community level significantly
    affected sensitivity to the dzud. Otor herders (migrant herders) can exacerbate
    the impact of dzuds (hoofed dzud).
  9: The study identifies factors contributing to vulnerability to dzud, including
    climate exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity; it examines the role of
    emergency aid in mitigating the impacts of dzud on households; it analyzes different
    methods of aid delivery and their effectiveness.
  10: The paper highlights the need for improved livestock quality over quantity.
    There is concern that aid may cause laziness and reduce productivity among herders.
  13: "Poorly targeted assistance and opaque distribution criteria can lead to local\
    \ con\uFB02ict and resentment in the short-term, and, over the longer term, may\
    \ perpetuate a dependency syndrome and lead to strategic poverty on the part of\
    \ some households. Donor investments are likely to have a more lasting impact\
    \ on the resilience of Mongolian pastoral social\u2013ecological systems when\
    \ they focus on longer term investments such as strengthening local institutions\
    \ for collective action."
  14: The paper focuses on the case study of dryland livestock systems and the impact
    of climate disasters (dzud) in Mongolia. It discusses challenges related to vulnerability,
    resource management, and disaster relief policies.
  15: The study focuses on Mongolia and its vulnerability to 'dzud' events. It highlights
    the importance of policy frameworks for pastureland tenure and management, including
    the designation of dzud reserves and effective coordination of otor (dzud reserve)
    movements.
Outcome(s) of Interest:

    economies.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Livestock losses due to dzud (severe winter disaster), pre-dzud poverty indicators
    (SFU/hh).
  5: Percent of herd lost in the dzud.
  7: Household income earning potential and household consumption behavior are impacted
    by livestock loss, which in turn may affect the nutritional status of household

    food availability.
  9: Impacts of dzud (severe winter disasters) on households, including livestock
    losses and vulnerability; effectiveness of emergency aid in mitigating dzud impacts.
  10: Increased dependence on external assistance and potential perverse incentives
    among herders, potentially leading to reduced productivity.
  13: "High livestock mortality and associated human suffering for Mongolia\u2019\
    s pastoralist population. Dzud interacts with other sources of stress and change\
    \ including economic shocks, institutional transformations, and the emerging effects\
    \ of climate change, all of which place additional stress on the system."
