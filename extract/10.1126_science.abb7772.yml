Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changing nutrient concentrations and availability of soil water affecting the
    CO2 fertilization effect (CFE).
  2: Decreasing global temporal trend of light-saturated photosynthesis per 100 ppm
    CO2 (b)
  3: Increasing atmospheric CO2, foliar physiology, and Leaf Area Index (LAI) are
    identified as drivers affecting GPP.
  5: Sensitivity of GPP to TWS is underestimated in models, decreasing trends in carboxylation
    from nutrient limitation, increasing water limitation.
  7: Decline in the carbon fertilization effect (CFE) on vegetation photosynthesis
    due to limiting effects of plant nutrients.
Highlights:
  1: Global CFE has declined across most terrestrial regions from 1982 to 2015, correlating
    with nutrient and water availability changes. This decline implies a weakening
    negative feedback on the climate system.
  2: Global temporal trend of b from satellite data and models shows a declining trend
    from 1982 to 2015. Grasslands and plants in cold climate zones exhibited a larger
    declining trend of b.
  3: The response of GPP to increasing atmospheric CO2 (b) has significantly declined
    globally. This decline is robust across multiple independent observations and
    is linked to both the direct effect on foliar physiology and the indirect effect
    on LAI. Climate zones respond differently to this decline, with colder regions
    experiencing stronger declining trends.
  5: Analyses showed a significant and spatially extensive decline in carbon uptake
    efficiency (b), which implies a substantial reduction of the positive effects
    of increasing atmospheric CO2 on terrestrial carbon uptake.
  7: The carbon fertilization effect (CFE) has limitations for long-term mitigation
    of climate change, and future warming might currently be underestimated.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis uses multiple long-term satellite- and ground-based datasets (NIRV,
    AVHRR NIRV, AVHRR+MODIS NIRV, NIRV+SIF) from 1982-2015.
  2: Linear and nonlinear multiple regression approaches were used to estimate b from
    satellite GPP proxies.  The Mann-Kendall test was used to estimate the trend of
    b pixel by pixel
  3: The study uses satellite observations of GPP proxies, ground GPP estimates from
    EC flux sites, a data-model fusion product (CCDAS GPP), satellite-based leaf area
    index (LAI), and the optimal fingerprint attribution method to analyze the temporal
    dynamics of 'b'. It also compares results to those from carbon cycle models (TRENDY
    v6 ensemble).
  5: Used terrestrial water storage (TWS) data to represent water availability and
    selected arid, temperate, and dry tropical climate zones as research areas, using
    a moving window of 15 years.
More Notes:
  1: The study uses satellite GPP proxies to examine the CFE and compares the observational
    data with carbon cycle models.
  2: The authors used multiple datasets (satellite GPP proxies, revised EC-LUE GPP,
    and multimodel mean GPP from TRENDY v6 ensemble) to assess the global declining
    trend of b.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: No relevant information
  3: This paper does not directly assess macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. It focuses
    on the impact of increasing atmospheric CO2 on Gross Primary Productivity (GPP).
  5: Terrestrial photosynthesis may not increase as much as models project, potentially
    reducing the potential of land-based climate mitigation, further accelerating
    global warming.
  7: Future warming might currently be underestimated.
