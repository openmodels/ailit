Drivers of Risk:
  1: Early-life weather and pollution exposures, specifically extreme precipitation,
    temperature, carbon monoxide, and ozone.
  3: Early-life exposure to environmental toxins. Weather (temperature and precipitation)
    indirectly affects human capital through impacts on agricultural and industrial
    output, leading to pollutant emissions (CO and O3).
  4: CO exposure, O3 exposure, Early-life extreme temperature and precipitation.
  8: Extreme Temperature, Precipitation, Weather
  13: Early-life pollution exposure.
  15: Extreme temperature, extreme precipitation, Carbon Monoxide (CO) pollution,
    Ozone (O3) pollution
  16: Temperature (>90% of distribution), Temperature (<10% of distribution), Precipitation
    (>90% of distribution), Precipitation (<10% of distribution), CO (std.), O3 (std.)
  21: High temperature, Low temperature, Low precipitation, CO (std), O3 (std)
  22: Early-life exposure to O3 (ozone) pollution
Highlights:
  1: Early-life pollution exposures negatively affect long-term cognitive outcomes,
    labor market outcomes, and lifetime earnings. Environmental regulations may be
    investments that fuel economic growth if they account for long-term human capital
    effects.
  13: Weather directly affects short-term anthropometric outcomes but has no direct
    effects on long-term cognitive and labor market outcomes.
  15: Higher O3 levels are associated with statistically significant negative impacts
    on math and language test scores. Higher CO levels are associated with statistically
    significant negative impacts on language test scores.
  16: O3 (std.) has statistically significant negative effects on both weekly hours
    worked and log of hourly earnings.
  21: High temperatures and low precipitation increase the incidence of low birth
    weight. Birth length is negatively affected by both high and low temperatures,
    and low precipitation. The effects of low precipitation extend to age 2 height.
    O3 (std) has a significant effect on Std. Non-Verbal Test Score, Std. Language
    Test Score, Achieved Years of Schooling, and Weekly Hours Worked.
  22: Early-life O3 exposure reduces schooling attainment, hours worked, and earnings.
    The effects of O3 on hours are driven by males and the informal sector, and the
    effects on earnings are driven by females and the informal sector. The paper provides
    the first evidence of the effects on long-term earnings of early-life pollution
    exposure in developing economies.
  23: The study emphasizes that long-term benefits of environmental regulation can
    outweigh costs and fuel economic growth in developing nations.
Methodology:
  1: The study combines a three-decade longitudinal survey measuring human capital
    development, a database of historical weather, and multiple databases characterizing
    carbon monoxide and ozone in the Philippines during the 1980s. The study examines
    short- and long-term human capital outcomes in relation to pollution and weather
    exposures.
  4: Ordinary least squares (OLS) including controls for weather variables, CO and
    O3 exposures, urban/rural residence, gender, season of birth, and household/parental
    risk factors. The measures of extreme temperature and precipitation are based
    on their distributions during a 10-year window, 1978 to 1987.
  8: The paper uses information from 2005. Mentions exposures at 90% and 10% level.
  13: "Instrumental variables (weather instruments), LIML, MBTSLS, OLS regressions\
    \ with robust standard errors, Bekker standard errors for LIML regressions, and\
    \ Koles\xE1r et al. (2015) standard errors for MBTSLS regressions."
  15: The study uses LIML (Limited Information Maximum Likelihood) and MBTSLS estimators
    to estimate the effects of CO and O3 exposure. It employs extreme weather and
    deviations from seasonal means as instruments in the first stage regressions.
    Sargan tests are used to assess the validity of the instruments.
  16: OLS regressions with robust standard errors. LIML and MBTSLS instrumental variable
    regressions are also used to address endogeneity in pollution variables, using
    extreme weather and deviations from seasonal means and interactions with local
    prevalence of polluters as instruments. Sargan tests are performed. Multiple hypothesis
    testing adjustment with Benjamini-Hochberg method.
  21: OLS estimates were used to estimate the short-term anthropometric outcomes.
    LIML estimates were used to estimate the long-term cognitive and long-term labor
    market outcomes. Multiple hypothesis testing adjustments were performed.
  22: The analysis generalizes outside the sample and assumes external validity to
    scale O3's effects on hours and earnings.
  23: The paper uses unique data and novel methods to examine the effects of weather
    and pollution on human capital, applying a discount rate model to calculate present
    value outcomes.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the Philippines and the 1980s.
  4: The study area is Metropolitan Cebu in the Philippines. The paper discusses the
    potential impacts of environmental exposures during prenatal and postnatal development
    on lifetime health and human capital.
  8: The table refers to Migration (Ever temporarily, Ever permanently) related to
    weather and climate.
  13: Exposure measures have been standardized to assist in the interpretation of
    the coefficients.
  15: The reported results are on cognitive outcomes and years of schooling. The paper
    uses instrumental variables to account for endogeneity in pollution variables.
    The findings suggest that environmental factors can affect human capital accumulation,
    which could impact long-term economic outcomes at a national level, although this
    is not explicitly modeled in the results on this page.
  16: The study includes a detailed set of control variables to account for potentially
    confounding factors. The analysis is performed for a specific dataset (n values
    are shown for different regressions).
  21: The study was conducted in Metro Cebu, Philippines. The results regarding typhoons
    may be affected by a lack of spatial or temporal variation in exposure.
  22: The authors justify their generalization based on the assumption that individuals
    were uninformed and unaware of their exposures to pollutants like CO and O3 during
    the early 1980s, and that the exposures were typical to other time periods in
    the area.

    methodology for analyzing the effects of early-life pollution exposure on human
    capital and labor market outcomes. It does not directly provide quantitative information
    or analysis of macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks of climate change, nor does
    it present costs and benefits of nation-wide adaptation.
  7: No relevant information
  11: This page focuses on the impact of early-life environmental factors (weather
    and pollution) on human capital outcomes (height, cognition, labor market outcomes)
    at the individual level in Metro Cebu, Philippines, not macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes at the national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Early-life ozone exposure negatively affects long-term cognitive outcomes, test
    scores, schooling, hours worked, earnings, and discounted lifetime earnings. A
    25 percent reduction in early-life ozone exposure would increase per person discounted
    lifetime earnings.
  3: Early-life pollution reduction by 25% leads to an increase of cumulative discounted
    lifetime earnings of $1,367 per person, $44.5 million in the province, and $2.05
    billion at the national level (or 2 per cent of 2005 GDP).
  4: Human capital, labor market outcomes.
  8: Morbidity (respiratory infections, diarrhea)
  13: Long-term cognitive and labor market outcomes, specifically standardized scores
    on non-verbal, math, and language tests (cognitive outcomes), and hours worked
    per week and log of hourly earnings in 2005 (labor market outcomes).
  15: No relevant information
  16: Weekly Hours Worked, Log of Hourly Earnings
  21: Short-term anthropometric outcomes (Low Birth Weight, Birth Length, Age 2 Height
    Z-Score); Long-term cognitive outcomes (Std. Non-Verbal Test Score, Std. Math
    Test Score, Std. Language Test Score, Achieved Years of Schooling); Long-term
    labor market outcomes (Weekly Hours Worked, Log of Hourly Earnings)
  22: Long-term earnings, hours worked
  23: The paper discusses the long-term benefits of reducing O3 exposure, with a discounted
    present value of $1,367 per person and a national impact of $2.05 billion, approximately
    2% of the Philippine GDP in 2005.
Quantitative material:
  1: A 25 percent reduction in early-life ozone exposure would increase per person
    discounted lifetime earnings by $1,367, which would scale to $2.05 billion at
    the national level (or 2 percent of 2005 GDP).
  3: A 25% reduction in early-life pollution exposure leads to a $2.05 billion increase
    in cumulative discounted lifetime earnings at the national level, equivalent to
    2% of 2005 GDP.

  13: The anthropometric outcomes in table 2 are low birth weight, birth length and
    age 2 height. Birth length and age 2 height are expressed in z-scores which convert
    the measures to the number of standard deviations or z-scores below or above the
    age and sex specific international reference mean

    precipitation, CO and O3 on Non-Verbal Test Score, Math Test Score, Language Test
    Score, and Achieved Years of Schooling.
  16: The table contains coefficients for the effect of weather and pollution variables
    on weekly hours worked and the log of hourly earnings, along with standard errors.
    Values are presented for the full sample, females, and the informal sector.
  21: P-values and adjusted p-values for the relationships between the drivers of
    risk and the outcomes of interest are provided.
  22: A hypothetical 25% reduction in early-life exposure to O3 precursor emissions
    is estimated to increase earnings by 2.8% and increase hours worked by 0.45 per
    week. Mean present value of lifetime earnings at age zero in Metropolitan Cebu
    is approximately $39,927.
  23: The analysis provides specific quantitative estimates of the economic benefits
    of reducing O3 exposure, such as $2.05 billion in benefits compared to a $50 million
    annual cost of the Philippine Clean Air Act.
