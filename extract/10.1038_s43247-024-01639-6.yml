    focusing on transmission potential changes in endemic and disease-free areas.
  9: The study evaluates the impact of climate and population changes on population
    living in high dengue suitability areas.
Highlights:
  1: There is an expansion in climate suitability for dengue in North America, East
    Asia, and the Mediterranean basin, where endemicity is not yet established.
  2: The analysis highlights that high climate suitability for dengue transmission
    is concentrated in tropics and near-equatorial regions, while low suitability
    is seen in higher latitudes.
  3: Global climate suitability for dengue virus transmission has varied with significant
    increases in suitability observed in regions like parts of South America, Africa,
    and South Asia.
  4: Climate suitability was highest within tropical, subtropical, and temperate areas
    around the equator. High climate suitability was estimated across the western
    tropical zone of Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, the Western
    Pacific, and Latin America. Areas of high climate suitability generally had higher
    dengue incidence than areas of low climate suitability.
  5: The study highlights an increase in the land area with high climate suitability
    for dengue transmission and the growth of human populations living in high-risk
    areas, contributing to a greater incidence of dengue.
  6: Temperate climate zones saw the largest increase in high climate suitability,
    while historically high-suitability tropical zones saw smaller increases.
  7: The increasing population in the Global South in high climate suitability areas
    leads to a heightened risk of dengue spread; linking urban planning and climate-based
    risks indicates new areas of transmission potential.
  8: Distinct climate and population effects are increasing DENV transmission suitability
    in both endemic and disease-free areas.
  9: "The study estimates past and present climate suitability for dengue transmission\
    \ by calculating the average Index P for 1979\u20131983 and 2018\u20132022, respectively."
Methodology:
  1: The study uses estimates of dengue transmission suitability based on historical
    temperature and humidity data to examine shifts in climatic variables and population
    growth.
  2: The analysis uses mechanistic models to define geographical limits of dengue
    transmission and includes non-linear relationships among mosquito-viral traits.
  3: The analysis is based on Index P, which quantifies climate suitability for dengue
    transmission using temperature and relative humidity data from satellite surface
    air temperature and relative humidity data.
  4: Estimates changes in climate suitability using a threshold of 0.5. Compares changes
    in land area and population between 1979-1983 and 2018-2022. Relates climate suitability
    to observed dengue incidence using reported case counts from countries with dengue
    surveillance data.
  5: The analysis involves comparing past and present climate suitability and performing
    censored linear regression models and random-effects models to estimate incidence
    rates.
  6: Analysis based on dengue suitability measure incorporating temperature and relative
    humidity effects on mosquito-viral traits, comparing data between 1979-1983 and
    2017-2022.
  7: The study analyzes empirical effects of climate factors like temperature and
    humidity on dengue transmission suitability from 1979 to 2022.
  8: The analysis uses a previously published climate suitability measure, Index P,
    based on a mechanistic climate-based dengue transmission model utilizing monthly
    temperature and humidity data from 1979 to 2022 globally.
  9: The study uses a Tobit model to quantify the relationship between a climate suitability
    index (Index P) and dengue virus (DENV) transmission for select countries (Brazil,
    Colombia, Taiwan, Costa Rica, Thailand, Vietnam). It also uses the seasonal Mann-Kendall
    test with Sen's slope to analyze trends in climate suitability from 1979-2022.
    Prewhitening algorithm is used to reduce impact of autocorrelation artifacts.
More Notes:
  4: The study acknowledges potential under-reporting of dengue cases due to limited
    surveillance in some regions, such as Central and Eastern Africa and notes that
    climate suitability should be interpreted as the potential for epidemic activity
    rather than endemic transmission.
  6: The Global South experienced population growth in high-suitability areas, whereas
    the Global North saw an expansion in land area with high suitability.
  9: "The study uses publicly available data, including gridded spatiotemporal data\
    \ of climate-based dengue virus transmission suitability from 1979 to 2022 (f\u200B\
    igshare), global gridded population counts and density (SEDAC, WorldPop), and\
    \ dengue case counts from various countries. The analysis was performed using\
    \ R statistical software."

    relative humidity data from 1979 to 2022, at a resolution of 360 arcseconds.
  9: The study calculates the change in population in high suitability areas by comparing
    the population in 2020 to the population in 1980. It also uses the seasonal Mann-Kendall
    test to estimate long-term trends in climate suitability, and Sen's slope to estimate
    the linear rate of change. Threshold for high climate suitability for DENV transmission
    is set at 0.5 (Index P).
