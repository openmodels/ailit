Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature changes; Slowest warming scenario (B1); Most rapid warming scenario
    (A2) under global climate models UKMO-HadCM3 and PCM
  3: No relevant information
  4: Temperature changes (seasonal average temperatures and temperature bins)
  5: Daily average temperature, rainfall, sunshine duration, air pressure, relative
    humidity, and average wind speed.
  7: Seasonal average temperatures (Tempspring, Tempsummer)
  8: Seasonal temperature changes (spring, summer, fall, winter)
  9: Changes in seasonal average temperatures (summer, spring, fall, winter) and sunshine
    hours.
  10: Daily average temperature, rainfall, sunshine duration, air pressure, relative
    humidity, wind speed.
  11: "Temperature changes, specifically the number of days with average temperatures\
    \ at certain ranges (e.g., [21-24\xB0C), 30\xB0C, and below 0\xB0C)."
  12: Temperature variations (seasonal average temperatures and temperature bins)
  13: Daily average temperature, Seasonal average temperatures
  14: Summer and winter temperatures.
  15: Summer temperature (Tempsummer) is the primary driver of risk examined.
  16: Future warming/climate change, specifically projected increases in seasonal
    (especially summer) average temperatures.
  17: Temperature changes (increased spring temperatures, elevated summer temperatures,
    lagged temperature changes).
Highlights:
  1: "Industrial output is nonlinear in temperature changes; Output responds positively\
    \ to higher spring temperatures and negatively to elevated summer temperatures;\
    \ Output increases linearly with temperature up to 21-24 degrees Celsius and then\
    \ declines sharply at higher temperatures; Lagged temperature changes exert large\
    \ and significant impacts on current year\u2019s output; Higher summer temperatures\
    \ have larger detrimental effects on output in low-temperature regions than in\
    \ high-temperature regions; Industrial output in China is projected to decrease\
    \ by 3-36% by 2080 under the slowest warming scenario (B1) and by 12-46% under\
    \ the most rapid warming scenario (A2) under the global climate models UKMO-HadCM3\
    \ and PCM."
  3: The paper investigates the impact of temperature on China's industrial output
    using firm-level data, includes sunshine duration in the analysis, and explores
    adaptation strategies in high-temperature regions.
  4: The study intends to obtain the total marginal effect of temperature on output,
    including direct and indirect effects through input productivities, input and
    output prices, and adaptation.
  5: "The coefficients of the temperature bins measure the marginal effect on output\
    \ of an additional day in the mth temperature bin, relative to a day in the [21\xB0\
    C, 24\xB0C) bin."
  7: Higher spring temperatures (Tempspring) are positively correlated with industrial
    output. Higher summer temperatures (Tempsummer) are negatively correlated with
    industrial output.
  8: Summer temperature has a statistically significant positive effect on value added
    per worker. The inclusion of sunshine variables affects the results, as does the
    inclusion of lagged variables.
  9: The cumulative negative effect of summer temperature increases on industrial
    output is substantial.
  10: "The relationship between temperature and output is nonlinear and exhibits an\
    \ inverted-U shape when temperature is above 15\xB0C. Output responds negatively\
    \ to low temperatures (< 12\xB0C)."
  11: "Industrial output increases approximately linearly with temperature up to 21-24\xB0\
    C, and then declines sharply with temperatures above 30\xB0C. Elevated temperatures\
    \ in prior years can negatively affect current year output."
  12: "Temperature variations impact output, with negative effects from summer and\
    \ winter temperatures and positive effects from spring temperatures. The critical\
    \ temperature threshold for negative impacts is identified as [21\xB0C, 24\xB0\
    C]. Future global warming is expected to lead to a reduction in output."
  13: Low and high temperatures negatively influence firms' investment; inventory
    is positively correlated with temperature; Output is nonlinear in temperature
    changes and exhibits negative responses to low and high temperatures; Temperature
    effects on output differ across industries.
  14: Higher summer temperatures have large and negative impacts on output. Higher
    winter temperatures also lead to substantial output losses in other industries,
    such as food processing, leather, rubber and non-ferrous metal smelting. High-temperature
    regions might be better than low-temperature regions at coping with high temperatures.
  15: '''High-temperature'' regions in China show better adaptation to elevated summer
    temperatures compared to low-temperature regions, based on value added per worker,
    though the paper caveats that direct evidence of adaptation is lacking.'
  16: Future warming is projected to significantly reduce China's industrial output.
    The magnitude of the reduction varies considerably depending on the climate model
    and warming scenario used.
  17: Industrial output exhibits nonlinear responses to temperature changes, responding
    positively to increased spring temperatures and negatively to elevated summer
    temperatures. Industrial firms in China may be more vulnerable to higher summer
    temperatures than firms in other countries.
Methodology:
  1: Firm-level panel data of annual industrial output is paired with fine-scale daily
    weather data to estimate the responses of industrial output to temperature changes
    in China
  3: The paper contributes to the literature by using firm-level data from a large
    country (other than the US) to examine the temperature effects on industrial output,
    incorporating sunshine duration as an explanatory variable, and providing evidence
    that adaptation to global warming may have been actively undertaken in high-temperature
    regions in China.
  4: Regression analysis using firm-level data in China, with firm and industry/year
    fixed effects, and including other weather variables (rainfall, sunshine duration,
    air pressure, relative humidity, and average wind speed) as controls.
  5: The temperature effects on output are identified from random variations in temperature
    over time using firm-level panel data from 1998 to 2007. They use two-way clustering
    to account for spatial and serial correlation of the error terms.
  7: Panel data analysis using firm-level data from China from 1998-2007. Models include
    firm fixed effects and two-digit industry/year fixed effects. Examines the effects
    of weather on industrial output using models with no lags and lagged values (up
    to four years) of the weather variables.
  8: The study uses regression analysis with firm fixed effects and two-digit industry/year
    fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered within firms and within prefecture-level
    city-years. The dependent variable is the log of value added per worker. Models
    include controls for rainfall, air pressure, relative humidity, average wind speed,
    and sunshine hours.
  9: Regression analysis using seasonal average temperatures and sunshine hours as
    explanatory variables for industrial output.
  10: Regression analysis using temperature bins as temperature variables, controlling
    for weather variables, firm fixed effects, and industry/year fixed effects. Standard
    errors are clustered within firms and within prefecture-level city-years. Models
    with no lags and two-year lags are considered.
  11: The study uses a regression model with temperature bins as temperature variables,
    controlling for rainfall, sunshine duration, air pressure, relative humidity,
    and average wind speed. Firm fixed effects and two-digit industry/year fixed effects
    are included, with standard errors clustered within firms and prefecture-level
    city-years. Two lags of weather variables are used.
  12: Econometric estimation strategies using firm-level data from China; Regression
    analyses using fixed effects models and dynamic panel data approaches (GMM); Robustness
    checks including variations in standard errors, inclusion of region-year fixed
    effects, and different data sampling criteria; Balanced sample from 1998 to 2007;
    Aggregation of firm-level data into a county panel.
  13: Panel data methodology exploring channels through which temperature in prior
    years might affect current year's output; regressions incorporate firm fixed effects
    and two-digit industry/year fixed effects; standard errors are clustered within
    firms and within prefecture-level city-years.
  14: "Regression analysis (Eq. 2) with firm fixed effects, year fixed effects, four\
    \ lags of weather variables (temperature, sunshine hours, rainfall, air pressure,\
    \ relative humidity, and average wind speed). Standard errors are clustered within\
    \ firms and within prefecture-level city-years. Estimated coefficients of temperature\
    \ variables are interpreted as the percentage changes in output with a 1\xB0C\
    \ increase in temperature. Investigates climate adaptation by interacting weather\
    \ variables with a dummy for high-temperature counties."
  15: The study uses regression analysis with firm fixed effects and two-digit industry
    year fixed effects to estimate the effect of summer temperature on output in 'high-temperature'
    regions. The definitions for 'high-temperature' are based on different geographic
    or climate boundaries, including the Huai River-Qin Mountains line, above-median
    humidity, and above-median rainfall. Climate change impacts are also projected
    using scenarios from Climate-Wizard, which are applicable to medium term (2050s)
    and long term (2080s).
  16: The study calculates projected changes in seasonal average temperatures using
    the ClimateWizard database, then computes firm-specific predicted changes in output
    based on coefficient estimates of cumulative temperature effects, weighted by
    firm share in total output, to estimate the impacts of future warming on China's
    industrial output. The results are applicable to the 2050s (medium term) and 2080s
    (long term) under different climate models (UKMO-HadCM3 and PCM) and warming scenarios
    (B1, A1B, and A2).
  17: Firm-level panel data analysis of annual industrial output combined with fine-scale
    daily weather data in China. Results are applicable to regions with clear distinctions
    of four seasons.
More Notes:
  1: Adaptation to warming may have been actively undertaken in high-temperature regions
    in China.
  3: This paper focuses on the industrial sector in China, which contributes 43% of
    the country's GDP.
  4: 'The study uses two different approaches to construct temperature variables:
    seasonal average temperatures and temperature bins.'
  5: The analysis is performed at the firm level, and the authors control for industry-year
    and firm fixed effects. They use weather data from 820 weather stations in China.
    For counties without a weather station, the weather information from the nearest
    neighboring county is imputed.
  7: The analysis focuses on temperature effects on output. Other weather variables
    were considered but not reported on this page. Weather variables are highly correlated.
    The results are applicable to China from 1998-2007.
  8: The figure mentioned depicts estimated temperature effects on output in percentage
    terms. The coefficients can be interpreted as the percentage changes in output
    with a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature.
  9: The inclusion of sunshine hours in the analysis significantly affects the parameter
    estimates for temperature variables, suggesting that excluding sunshine hours
    can lead to biased results.
  10: Higher winter temperatures increase the share of female workers and reduce the
    share of male workers, with an insignificant impact on the total number of workers
    employed, potentially reducing output due to physically demanding industrial jobs.
  11: The study finds lagged temperature effects, where temperature changes in the
    prior two years also affect current year's output.
  12: The analysis focuses on industrial activities in China, considering the impact
    of weather on weekdays, weekends, and holidays. The paper explores lagged temperature
    effects on output.
  13: Analysis focuses on industrial firms.
  15: "The coefficients for the temperature effect are interpreted as percentage changes\
    \ in output with a 1\xB0C increase in temperature. The regressions include controls\
    \ for sunshine hours, rainfall, air pressure, relative humidity, and average wind\
    \ speed."
  16: The main factor causing future output reductions is the projected increase in
    summer temperature. The authors also mention that the estimated climate impacts
    on industrial output may be larger than the damage that will actually be caused
    by global warming in the long term. Results are presented for a range of robustness
    checks, displayed in different columns of Table 3, relating to different methods
    used to estimate the impacts of temperature change on output.
  17: The estimates of future damage may be overestimated due to the inability to
    capture long-term adaptation by firms.

    slowest warming scenario (B1) and by 12-46% under the most rapid warming scenario
    (A2) under the global climate models UKMO-HadCM3 and PCM
  3: No relevant information
  4: Regression analysis to estimate percentage changes in output with a 1 degree
    Celsius increase in seasonal average temperatures.
  5: "The paper uses temperature bins to quantify the effect of temperature on output\
    \ (e.g., Tbin1r;t = number of days when daily average temperature is below 0\xB0\
    C). It also uses linear and quadratic forms of rainfall, sunshine duration, air\
    \ pressure, relative humidity, and average wind speed."
  7: "A 1\xB0C increase in Tempspring is associated with a 1.6-3.0% increase in output,\
    \ depending on model specifications. Parameter estimates of Tempsummer are negative\
    \ and statistically significant at the 1% level."
  8: Table 1 provides coefficient estimates for the impact of seasonal temperature
    on log value added per worker. For example, a 1 degree Celsius increase in summer
    temperature is associated with a 0.0346 (3.46%) increase in value added per worker
    in model (1) and a 0.0451 (4.51%) increase in value added per worker in model
    (2). Column (3) uses a one year lag and finds cumulative effects of 0.0764 (7.64%)
  9: "Lagged effects: A 1\xB0C increase in Tempsummer and Tempwinter in year t-1 can\
    \ reduce output in year t by 1.9e2.0% and 1.8e3.2%, respectively, while each 1\xB0\
    C increase in Tempspring and Tempfall in the previous year can increase current\
    \ year\u2019s output by 3.4e3.9% and 2.2e2.4%."
  10: "A critical temperature threshold of [21\xB0C, 24\xB0C) is identified, relative\
    \ to which other temperature bins have non-positive marginal effects on industrial\
    \ output."
  11: "Replacing days at [21-24\xB0C) temperatures with full days at 30\xB0C will\
    \ decrease output by 7.7%, while replacing with days below 0\xB0C will decrease\
    \ output by 9.5%."
  12: "Negative contemporaneous temperature effects on output from rising summer temperatures\
    \ are statistically significant at the 1% level, ranging between 2.7% and 5.6%.\
    \ Negative effects of each 1\xB0C increase in winter temperature lie between 1.2%\
    \ and 3.4%. Positive temperature effects on output in the spring are also robust.\
    \ Cumulative effects of summer and winter temperatures on output are negative\
    \ and statistically significant, at (-)8.9% to (-)26.5% and (-)6.2% to (-)14.2%,\
    \ respectively. Cumulative effect of spring temperature on output is also statistically\
    \ significant and ranges between 5.9% and 14.6%. Cumulative effect of fall temperature\
    \ on output is positive and statistically significant, ranging from 5.6% to 14.8%."
  13: "An additional day at 30\xB0C or 12\xB0C can lead to reductions in firms' investment\
    \ by about 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively., An additional day with average temperatures\
    \ below 3\xB0C or above 30\xB0C can cause a significant increase in firms' inventory\
    \ levels., Cumulative effects of a 1\xB0C increase in summer temperature leads\
    \ to output reductions of 48.7%, 41.2% and 34.7% respectively in ferrous metal\
    \ mining, timber, and rubber industries."
  14: "A 1\xB0C increase in winter temperature leads to a 42.9% reduction in stationary\
    \ output and a 33% reduction in office machinery output."
  15: "A 1\xB0C increase in summer temperature in 'high-temperature' regions (defined\
    \ in three different ways) has a statistically significant positive effect on\
    \ log value added per worker, suggesting these regions are better at adapting\
    \ to elevated temperatures. The specific coefficients are 0.0480 (significant\
    \ at 5% level), 0.0468 (significant at 5% level), and 0.0227 (insignificant),\
    \ depending on the definition of 'high-temperature' regions."
  16: Under the UKMO-HadCM3 model, medium-term output decreases range from 10.6-27.2%
    (A2 scenario), 12.9-35.9% (A1B), and 5.2-19.6% (B1). Long-term decreases range
    from 14.8-45.6% (A2), 15.8-45.7% (A1B), and 16.1-36.0% (B1). Under the PCM model,
    medium-term output decreases range from 5.2-10.3% (A2), 7.4-17.0% (A1B), and 3.0-8.5%

    \ of this century under the slowest warming scenario and decrease by 12-46% under\
