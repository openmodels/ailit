Drivers of Risk:
  1: Weather (temperature and precipitation).
  3: Variations in temperature and rainfall; interannual weather fluctuations in early
    childhood.
  7: Historical weather variables (monthly mean temperature and monthly accumulated
    precipitation)
  8: Weather conditions (annual mean temperature)
  11: Cross-decade variation in local temperature and precipitation is examined as
    a driver impacting farm value at a county level.
  14: Long-term weather conditions (temperature and precipitation)
  16: Short-term weather conditions, specifically annual mean temperature (T) and
    accumulated precipitation (P).
  17: Temperature and precipitation.
  18: Short-term weather conditions (average temperature and accumulated precipitation).
  23: Extreme temperatures in utero and maternal exposure to infectious diseases promoted
    by weather, like malaria, increase adverse birth outcomes, impacting human capital.
  24: Long-term average weather variables such as temperature and precipitation.
  25: Average temperature and accumulated precipitation in the state of birth.
  26: Annual mean temperature and accumulated precipitation at the year of birth,
    at the three years after birth, and at two years before birth.
  27: Cross-year weather fluctuations (temperature and precipitation) during early
    life.
  28: Early-life weather fluctuations (temperature and precipitation).
  30: Hotter and wetter weather.
  33: Changes in mean temperature and accumulated precipitation, both short-term (annual)
    and long-term (10-year average).
  34: Climate (weather variables)
  36: Decadal average of annual mean temperature and decadal average of annual accumulated
    precipitation
  37: Decadal temperature, decadal precipitation, annual temperature, and annual precipitation.
Highlights:
  1: The effects of hotter and wetter weather on productivity were strong early in
    U.S. history, but these effects have generally been attenuated in recent decades.
    Estimates from a given period may be of limited use in forecasting the longer-term
    impacts of climate change.
  3: The relationship between weather and productivity/occupational income has changed
    over time, suggesting adaptation to climate.
  8: County farm value has adapted to the permanent features of local weather over
    time in the United States.
  11: The effect of temperature and rainfall variations on farm value changed significantly
    until the mid-twentieth century, becoming more beneficial over time until stabilizing
    around 1960-1970.
  14: "Temperature and precipitation have statistically significant effects on farm\
    \ values per acre. The effects of temperature and precipitation on farm values\
    \ appear to vary between the 19th and 20th centuries, as indicated by statistically\
    \ significant interaction terms (T \xD7 D19 and P \xD7 D19)."
  16: The analysis shows significant effects of both temperature and precipitation
    on farm output value per acre, with differences in the magnitude and direction
    of these effects between the 19th and 20th centuries. The interaction term between
    temperature and precipitation also has a significant effect in some specifications.
  17: Adaptation occurred more rapidly in hotter areas over time. Adaptation to precipitation
    was evident in wetter areas, but the rate of adaptation seems to be smaller than
    that of temperature.
  18: Adaptation of farm output value to weather occurred more-or-less steadily across
    decades; forecast of the impact of climate change during one century made with
    data from the prior century would be problematic.
  23: Adverse birth outcomes from climate-related conditions affect life-time human
    capital accumulation, influencing factors such as schooling and adult income.
  24: The significant adverse effect of early-life high temperature and precipitation
    on lower adult income for cohorts born before 1900 and the diminishing effect
    for cohorts born after 1930.
  25: Early-life weather conditions (temperature and precipitation) are related to
    adult income.
  26: Early-life weather conditions (temperature and precipitation) influence occupational
    income in adulthood.
  27: Adult occupational income scores are highly associated with cross-year weather
    fluctuations for specific years in early life. Weather conditions before birth
    do not have meaningful effects.
  28: The effect of short-term weather fluctuations on adult income diminished across
    cohorts born in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Early-life temperature
    had a positive effect on adult income for cohorts born in the second half of the
    nineteenth century, but this effect attenuated for cohorts born later.
  30: Human efforts to enhance agricultural technologies and improve ecological environments
    have been effective in overcoming the adverse effects of hotter and wetter weather
    in the U.S.
  34: County boundary adjustments do not cause critical problems in estimating fixed
    effects models.
  36: Long-term temperature and precipitation changes significantly affect farm values,
    with the impact varying over time (as indicated by the year interaction terms).
  37: Temperature and precipitation in the 19th century had a statistically significant
    negative impact on county farm value and farm output value. Adaptation, reflected
    in the coefficients, occurred more substantially when only counties without boundary
    changes were considered, but the magnitude was somewhat smaller than the baseline
    estimation, particularly in the effect on farm output value. Excluding Southern
    counties yielded similar results.
Methodology:
  1: Cross-sectional and panel methods are used to analyze the relationship between
    weather and productivity from 1860-2000 in the U.S. Hedonic models are also mentioned.
  3: Panel fixed effect methods to estimate the response of farm productivity to variations
    in temperature and rainfall; Census data from 1940-2000; fixed effect estimator
    to find effects on adult occupational income of interannual weather fluctuations
    in early childhood.
  7: "Uses geostatistical technique called \u201CKriging\u201D to estimate missing\
    \ county-level weather data based on surrounding weather stations, weighting by\
    \ inverse distance squared."
  8: Cross-sectional analysis using scatter plots to investigate the relationships
    between county average of farm value and weather conditions. Regression analysis
    to adjust for county boundary changes.
  11: The analysis is performed using weighted ordinary least squares regressions,
    controlling for agricultural technologies and county factors, with fixed effects
    for year, state by year, and county in some specifications. The analysis uses
    data from census years 1880 to 2000.
  14: Panel data regression analysis using county-level data across the 19th and 20th
    centuries. Models include various fixed effects (state, state x century, state
    x year, county).
  16: Panel regression analysis is used to estimate the relationship between weather
    conditions (temperature and precipitation) and farm output value per acre, controlling
    for state, year, and county fixed effects. The analysis is performed separately
    for the 19th and 20th centuries and for both centuries combined.
  17: Regression analysis of county farm value on decadal temperature and precipitation
    and their interaction. Compares farm value in the late twentieth century relative
    to that in the late nineteenth century.
  18: "Panel regression comparing 1870\u20131900 to 1970\u20132000, with state-by-year\
    \ and county fixed effects; short-term weather variables as average temperature\
    \ and accumulated precipitation in one year before each census year."
  24: Bivariate analysis of cross-sectional data on average occupational income scores;
    cohorts from state-of-birth data aggregated from 1880 to 1990; weather data imputed
    by Kriging interpolation technique.
  25: Regression analysis is used to determine the relationship between average weather
    conditions in early life (state of birth average temperature and precipitation)
    and adult income for two cohorts (born 1860-1899 and 1931-1960) of native adult
    white males in the United States.
  26: "Regression analysis of cohort outcomes on early life weather conditions, controlling\
    \ for state of birth, year of birth, and census year fixed effects. The model\
    \ regresses cohort outcomes on early life weather conditions using data on native\
    \ adult white males from U.S. censuses of 1880 and 1900\u20131990, which span\
    \ the years of birth 1860\u20131960."
  27: Regression analysis with state of birth fixed effects, focusing on within-state,
    across-year weather variations. Examines the impact of short-term weather fluctuations
    on adult income across cohorts using a 40-year moving window.
  28: Regression analysis using a 40-year moving window, controlling for temperature
    one year after birth and precipitation at the year of birth.
  30: The study extends the time window to the past century-and-a-half and quantifies
    the level of adaptation from various aspects (cross sectional and panel fixed
    approach, agricultural and individual productivity, and short-term and long-term
    adaptation).
  32: The paper uses Kriging estimation to estimate annual and decadal weather variables
    for randomly selected counties, comparing these estimates to actual values to
    test the validity of the estimation method.
  33: County-level monthly weather (mean temperature and accumulated precipitation)
    are estimated by Kriging interpolation. Short-term weather variables are annual
    mean temperature and accumulated precipitation in each census year. Long-term
    weather variables are the 10-year average of annual mean temperature and annual
    accumulated precipitation prior to each census year.
  34: Panel regression analysis with county fixed effects from 1870 to 2000, using
    data from U.S. federal population and agricultural censuses, and U.S. county data
    books. County boundary adjustments were performed to maintain consistent geographic
    units.
  36: Regression analysis using county-level data, adjusting for county boundary changes.
    Includes fixed effects of year and accounts for clustering of errors. Results
    are applicable to the US agricultural sector between 1880 and 2000.
  37: Regression analysis is used to estimate the relationship between county farm
    value/output and weather variables, with and without controlling for county boundary
    changes and Southern counties.
More Notes:
  1: Adaptation can occur through adjusting input mixes, choosing alternative technologies,
    or developing new technologies. Ecological changes amplified by human action can
    also play a role, especially if property rights are not well-established.
  3: The authors argue that historical relationships between weather and economic
    outcomes can be unstable over time, meaning that estimates from one period (e.g.,
    circa 1900) may not be reliable for forecasting impacts in another period (e.g.,
    circa 2000) or the future; they do not characterize specific determinants of productivity
    change to measure the historical adaptation.
  7: There is a potential double counting issue in calculating farm output value because
    some crops are used for feeding livestock.
  14: The table explores the relationship between long-term weather conditions and
    agricultural land values over time, considering both temperature and precipitation.
  16: The dependent variable is in natural logarithms, implying that the coefficients
    can be interpreted as approximate percentage changes.
  17: The analysis uses demeaned interaction of temperature and precipitation. The
    paper also uses the value of county farm output as an alternative measure of farm
    productivity.
  18: The magnitude of the adaptation to the weather (in other words, the difference
    in marginal effect across the centuries) is similar to what was estimated using
    farm value and long-term weather variables in a previous subsection.
  24: Suggests technological adaptation may have mitigated the negative effects of
    weather on economic productivity over the early twentieth century.
  25: The analysis uses IPUMS data and Krijging interpolated weather variables.
  26: The analysis focuses on the impact of weather fluctuations around the year of
    birth and their impact on occupational income.
  27: The study suggests that the coefficients may vary across cohorts due to factors
    like food supply, public programs, and technological adaptation. The effect of
    weather on adult income has changed across cohorts.
  28: The analysis focuses on white males. The study uses historical data from the
    US.
  30: "Today\u2019s relationships between weather or climate and economic outcomes\
    \ may be poor guides to the future forms of such relationships, inasmuch as these\
    \ relationships have been unstable over historical time scales."
  32: The appendix describes the data used in the study, including farm value per
    farm-land acre and farm output value per farm-land acre as measures of U.S. farm
    productivity. This suggests that agricultural productivity may be related to the
    weather variables being estimated and measured, although it is not directly discussed
    on this page.
  33: The data is from the Nineteenth-Century U.S. Climate Data Set Project, the National
    Climate Data Center, and the U.S. Historical Climatology Network. The data spans
    from 1870 to 2000 (census years).
  37: The analysis focuses on adaptation in the agricultural sector. The paper suggests
    that changes in county boundaries and regional factors (Southern counties) can
    influence the estimated impact of weather variables. Statistical significance
    is indicated by *, **, and *** at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.
No relevant information:
  22: This page focuses on a measurement error problem (double-counting of farm output)
    in historical U.S. census data and methods to address it. It does not directly
    discuss macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks of climate change, costs/benefits
    of adaptation, or their impact on national-level outcomes. The focus is on data
    accuracy for historical analysis, not climate change impacts.

Quantitative material:
  1: The paper documents significant responses of agricultural and individual productivity
    to weather using cross-sectional and panel methods.
  3: The response of both farm-productivity measures to high temperature or rainfall
    is estimated to be more negative in the early parts of the sample than in recent
    years; being born in warmer or wetter areas was associated with substantially
    lower occupational income score in adulthood for those born prior to 1950, but
    this correlation disappears among those born more recently; the effect on adult
    occupational income of interannual weather fluctuations in early childhood was
    strongest among those born earlier in the sample and is sharply attenuated among
    those born in the past 50 years.
  7: Data on farm value per farmland acre is used from 1870 to 2000. Farm output value
    is total value of all farm products within the year prior to enumeration day,
    but is unavailable for census years 1910, 1920 and 1930.
  8: "Uses micro samples from the 1880 and 1900\u20131990 IPUMS-Integrated Public\
    \ Use Microdata Series"
  14: The table presents coefficients from regressions of log(county average farm
    value per acre) on temperature (T), precipitation (P), and interactions between
    these variables and a dummy variable for the 20th century (D19).
  16: The table provides regression coefficients showing the impact of temperature
    and precipitation on farm output value per acre, along with standard errors, adjusted
    R-squared values, and the number of observations.
  17: Cross-century difference in farm value as a ratio is estimated to be 13.7 for
    the average county and 19.1 for the hot county based on temperature changes. Cross-century
    difference in farm value as a ratio is estimated to be 1.6 for a county with average
    annual precipitation and 1.9 for a wet county based on precipitation.
  18: Hot and rainy short-term weather was less favorable for producing agricultural
    output in the late nineteenth century than it was in the late twentieth century.
  24: "There are statistically significant estimated coefficients for the relationship\
    \ between early-life weather and adult income: \u20130.0094 for temperature and\
    \ \u20130.0024 for precipitation."
  25: The figure plots a proxy of adult income against state of birth average temperature
    and precipitation. Cohorts are grouped into those born before 1900 and those born
    after 1930.
  26: Figure 4 displays the estimated regression coefficient on the interaction of
    the indicated weather variable and a dummy for the calendar year minus year of
    birth, along with 95 percent confidence intervals.
  27: The year in which temperature has the most substantial, significant effect on
    adult occupational income is one year after birth; the effect declines over the
    next two years. The effect of precipitation is most substantial at the year of
    birth and then becomes non-significant.
  28: A one-degree increase in annual mean temperature at age 1 resulted in a 2.4
    percent increase in adult income (measured by occupational income score) during
    the 1870s to 1910s for cohorts born around 1890.
  30: Farm value and farm output value substantially declined as the region became
    hotter and wetter in the late nineteenth century, but the adverse effects have
    been almost completely attenuated in recent decades in the U.S.
  32: 'Correlation coefficients between estimated and actual values are reported:
    0.9699 and 0.9683 for annual and decadal mean temperature, respectively; 0.9284
    and 0.9791 for annual and decadal mean precipitation, respectively.'
  34: Sample means of farm-productivity measures and controls by census year are reported
    in Appendix Table 2. Estimated coefficients of the interaction terms between each
    weather variable and each year dummy, and their standard errors.
  36: Regression coefficients and standard errors for the impact of weather (temperature
    and precipitation) on farm value per acre, interacted with year dummies from 1880-2000.
  37: The table presents coefficients for the interaction between weather variables
    (temperature and precipitation) and a dummy variable indicating census years in
    the 19th century. These coefficients are interpreted as the effect of weather
    variables on farm value or output value.
