Drivers of Risk:
  1: Greenhouse gas emissions pathways
  3: Greenhouse gas emissions pathways
  4: Temperature pathways (for physical risks); technological, policy and socio-economic
    factors (for transition risks)
  6: Temperature change pathways and their underlying socio-economics.
  8: Growing coal, oil, and gas demand, lack of land use policy, carbon and energy
    intensity improvements, behavior changes including reduced meat demand and goods
    consumption, phase out of F-gases.
  9: Heatwave, major heatwave, hydrological drought, river flooding, agricultural
    drought, maize heat stress, and change in maize crop duration.
  10: Major heatwaves, river flooding, agricultural drought, and temperature increase
    above the 1981-2010 period.
  11: The outcomes are impacted by temperature increases as indicated by the differences
    between the NDC Pledges scenario and the 2C Central scenario.
  12: Fossil fuel demand reductions, coal plant reductions.
  13: No relevant information
  15: Carbon prices, potential stranding of carbon-intensive assets, demand reductions
    for fossil fuels, changes to electricity and food prices, major heatwave likelihood,
    change in maize crop duration.
  16: Carbon intensity and carbon pricing, reduced demand for fossil fuels, and systemic
    financial risk.
  18: No relevant information
  19: Shocks or changes impacting outcomes include heatwaves, river floods, droughts
    (hydrological and agricultural), and high temperatures affecting crops.
  20: Physical risks are driven by physical hazards (7 metrics), while transition
    risks are driven by factors related to transitioning to a low-carbon economy (10
    metrics). Scenarios include different levels of GHG emissions and temperature
    increases.
  28: Transition risks are highlighted as stemming from the shift from carbon-intensive
    to low-carbon energy sources and related structural economic changes.
  29: Coal-plant capacity (related to job losses and coal community decline); sector-level
    emissions intensity; feasibility of the transition (abatement costs, carbon prices,
    coal plant idling); energy portfolio default likelihoods; electricity and food
    prices (household energy costs)
  31: Drought, river flooding, heatwaves, reductions in potential crop yield, and
    increases in global mean surface temperature are drivers of risk.
  33: Increased likelihood of significant droughts, changes in growing degree-days
    affecting crop growth duration, and increased likelihood of damagingly high temperatures
    (above 36 oC) during the maize reproductive phase.
  34: Temperature changes of between 3 oC and 4oC by 2100
  35: "Different temperature increase scenarios are being evaluated: below 2\xB0C,\
    \ around 2.5\xB0C, and 1.5\xB0C. Specific drivers for the 1.5\xB0C scenario include\
    \ electricity decarbonization, electrification of end-use sectors, reduced industrial\
    \ manufacture demand, smaller and more efficient new buildings, changes in transport\
    \ behavior, limited meat consumption, improved crop practices, and afforestation."

Highlights:
  1: Analyzes the near-term transition and longer-term physical climate risks of different
    greenhouse gas emissions pathways
  4: Physical risks by 2050 depend greatly on the temperature pathway. Transition
    risks by 2030 are most sensitive to temperature pathways. Transition risks also
    depend on technological, policy, and socio-economic factors.
  5: Notes the inadequacy of current approaches in providing a holistic interpretation
    of risks associated with different climate pathways.
  6: Presents an integrated framework for physical and transition risks across a range
    of temperature scenarios.
  8: Absent climate policy (No Policy scenario), temperatures could rise to 4.3oC
    by 2100. Current ambitions (NDC Pledges) lead to a median temperature increase
    of 3.1oC by 2100. Achieving a 1.5C scenario requires significant changes, including
    phasing out liquids and natural gas from transport, rapid technology improvement,
    and behavior changes.
  9: Distinguishes between acute risks (event likelihoods) and chronic risks (crop
    growth duration change and impact averages).
  10: The chance of experiencing a major heatwave and three agricultural indicators
    have the most non-linear relationships with temperature and show the greatest
    difference between temperature scenarios.
  11: The most important outcomes include the increased frequency of heat stress for
    maize and a significant reduction in yields under certain climate scenarios.
  12: The NDC pathway to 2030 for the EU+UK and USA is more stringent than the 2C
    Central scenario in terms of emissions reductions, leading to higher transition
    risk metrics by 2030.
  13: Scenarios aimed at the same temperature goal can have considerably different
    transition risks by 2030.
  14: "The 2\xB0C-targeted pathway ensemble mostly overlaps with the possibility space\
    \ represented in the IPCC\u2019s SR1.5 database."
  15: Scenarios with similar longer-term physical risks could have very different
    near-term transition risks.
  16: Comparing physical and transition risks in a consistent scenario framework provides
    a basis for building further analysis.
  18: Scenarios explore different pathways, including fragmented regional approaches
    and varying degrees of technological focus
  20: Physical and transition risks vary across different climate scenarios and regions.
    Some transition metrics capture transition opportunities. The analysis links scenario
    analysis to sectoral implications.
  28: Focus is placed on integrated assessment model outputs to capture salient transition
    risk-related variables, employing indicators to track progress towards the Paris
    Agreement goals.
  29: The analysis aims to measure transition risks by focusing on metrics like mitigation
    costs, emissions intensity, and fuel shares, derived from IAMs.
  31: Physical risks are characterized by the median ratio between scenarios (compared
    to the 2C Central scenario), with the 90th percentile ratio shown as a 'worst
    case'.
  33: Drought and high temperatures can significantly impact maize yields, with potential
    reductions related to growing period duration and heat stress during the reproductive
    phase.
  35: "The paper explores plausible technology variations (high renewables vs. non-renewables)\
    \ and transition pathways that achieve different levels of warming (below 2\xB0\
    C, around 2.5\xB0C, and 1.5\xB0C). The 2.5\xB0C scenario reflects skepticism about\
    \ achieving the 2\xB0C goal and aligns with updated NGFS NDC scenarios. A specific\
    \ 1.5\xB0C scenario is developed emphasizing rapid decarbonization and changes\
    \ in various sectors."
Methodology:
  1: The paper analyzes near-term transition and longer-term physical climate risks
    associated with different greenhouse gas emissions pathways.
  4: Integrated framework to explore near term (to 2030) transition risks and longer
    term (to 2050) physical risks, globally and in specific regions, for a range of
    plausible greenhouse gas emissions and associated temperature pathways.
  5: Discusses the need for integrated assessment models to assess both transition
    and physical risks.
  6: Combines a technology-rich, regionally disaggregated IAM, a reduced complexity
    climate model, and a suite of impacts models. Results applicable to the 21st century.
  8: Scenarios were run to explore temperature changes across the 21st century under
    different emissions pathways, including scenarios targeting specific temperature
    increases (1.5oC, 2oC, 2.5oC, 3oC, 4oC) with median likelihoods.
  9: Indicators calculated at 0.5x0.5 degree resolution and averaged to the regional
    scale. Likelihood indicators are interpreted as acute risks. Change in crop growth
    duration is a chronic risk. Impacts are annual averages, characterizing chronic
    risks.
  10: "Metrics are normalized by values in 2050 (physical risk) and 2030 (transition\
    \ risk) with the 2\xB0C Central scenario. Assumes the significance of change is\
    \ directly proportional to the change in metric. The 1981-2010 period is used\
    \ as a reference for physical climate impacts."
  12: Model-specific to GCAM.
  13: Exploration of transition dynamics across a range of 2oC-targeted scenarios
    using a wider range of indicators to assess transitions.
  14: The analysis considers different socio-economic pathways (e.g., 2C SSP3) and
    technological assumptions about renewables, CCS, and nuclear.
  15: Physical risk analysis focused on mid-century, salient for policy, corporate,
    household and financing decisions today.
  16: The framework provides a scenario analysis for physical and transition consequences
    of different plausible emissions pathways, downscaling to firm- and household-level
    financial risks.
  17: The study uses GCAM and MAGICC models. GCAM was run by H.M. and M.G., MAGICC
    by D.B., and climate impact models by N.W.A.
  18: Scenarios range from no new policies to compliance with the Paris Agreement
    and various socio-economic pathways
  20: The analysis uses integrated assessment and physical impacts models to produce
    risk-related output indicators for each scenario. Physical risk metrics are for
    2050, while transition risk metrics are for 2030. GWP100 is used for aggregate
    GHG emissions.
  27: Land-use change emissions are in addition to the constraint, and their price
    is determined as an exogenously specified proportion of the fossil emissions price.
  28: The study employs a separate climate module and impacts models for subsequent
    analysis steps.
  29: The paper analyzes indicators produced by Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs)
    to measure transition risks. It draws from diagnostic exercises comparing major
    IAM characteristics. The analysis focuses on metrics related to emissions, energy,
    and costs.
  30: The uncertainty is introduced by sampling the equilibrium climate sensitivity,
    ocean mixing rate, and climate-carbon cycle feedback strength.
  31: Spatially-explicit global-scale impacts models are used to calculate seven indicators
    of hazard and related impact across different sectors for each emissions scenario,
    all calculated over a 30-year period. Damage functions relate indicators to increase
    in global mean surface temperature, calculated from CMIP5 climate models and combined
    with probability distributions of temperature change for emissions scenarios.
  33: Drought likelihood averaged over cells with >1000 people for human impacts and
    over cells with cropland for agricultural impacts. Maize yield potential change
    assessed by change in time to accumulate growing degree-days. Likelihood of damaging
    temperatures weighted by maize cropland area. Analysis uses a baseline period
    of 1981-2010.
  34: explore variations around underlying socio-economic trends
  35: "The analysis uses the GCAM model. The scenarios include high renewables, greater\
    \ role for non-renewables (nuclear and carbon capture), and a 1.5\xB0C scenario\
    \ emphasizing rapid electricity decarbonisation. The GCAM data system is publicly\
    \ available."

  6: Scenarios spanning 1.5-4oC temperatures.
  8: No Policy scenario sees temperatures rise to 4.3oC by 2100. NDC Pledges scenario
    projects temperatures rising to 3.1oC by 2100. 1.5C scenario peaks at 1.7oC around

  10: "A value of 1.5 means the likelihood of an event is 50% greater than the 2\xB0\

    \ the 2\xB0C Central scenario's risk, and the 1.5C scenario's risk would be 0.9\
    \ times the 2\xB0C Central scenario's risk. There would be a 30-40% greater chance\
    \ of a major heatwave in 2050 with the NDC Pledges scenario than the 2\xB0C Central\
    \ scenario in most regions. River flooding is an 18% increase in India (compared\
    \ to 12% globally), and agricultural drought frequency is around a 25% increase\
    \ in India for the NDC Pledges vs. 2\xB0C Central scenarios."
