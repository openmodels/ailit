Drivers of Risk:
  8: Different emissions scenarios (No Policy, NDC Pledges, 1.5C, 2C, 2.5C, 2C SSP3)
    and their underlying assumptions drive temperature changes.
  10: Increased likelihood of acute events (heatwaves, river flooding, agricultural
    drought); Changes in crop growth duration/yield.
  12: Different climate change mitigation scenarios (1.5C, 2C Central, NDC Pledges)
    and the resulting emissions reductions needed to achieve them.
  14: Regionally uncoordinated socio-economics, different technological assumptions
    around renewables, CCS and nuclear.
  15: Carbon prices; potential stranding of carbon-intensive assets; demand reductions
    for fossil fuels; changes to electricity and food prices; stringent mitigation
    action leads to higher abatement costs and sector-specific transition risks; physical
    climate hazards; long-term physical climate-related damages.
  16: Carbon intensity, carbon pricing, reduced demand for fossil fuels, first-round
    exposure of investors to carbon-intensive sectors, and second-round effects from
    financial firms' investment in each other. Also physical and transition risks.
  17: No relevant information
  19: Physical hazard indicators (heatwaves, river floods, hydrological drought, agricultural
    drought, heat stress for maize, change in maize crop growth duration); Transition
    risk indicators (carbon price, GHG emissions intensity of GDP reductions, fossil
    fuel demand reductions, coal plant capacity reductions)
  29: Stranding of coal plant capacity, abatement costs, carbon prices, energy portfolio
    default likelihoods, household energy costs (electricity and food prices).
  30: Dynamics of the transition (from carbon-intensive to low-carbon economy)
  31: Increase in global mean surface temperature.
  32: Increases in global mean surface temperature leading to heatwaves, river flooding,
    and water resources drought.
  33: Drought (likelihood and impact), changes in crop yield potential (due to growing
    degree-days), and damaging high temperatures during the maize reproductive phase.
Highlights:
  4: Physical risks depend greatly on the temperature pathway by 2050. Transition
    risks are most sensitive to temperature pathways by 2030. Transition risks depend
    on technological, policy, and socio-economic factors for pathways with a 2oC target.
  8: The No Policy scenario leads to a 4.3oC temperature rise by 2100. The NDC Pledges
    scenario leads to a 3.1oC temperature rise by 2100. The 1.5C scenario peaks at
    1.7oC around 2050, returning to below 1.5oC by 2080 and down to 1.3oC by 2100.
  10: The chance of experiencing a major heatwave and the three agricultural indicators
    have the most highly non-linear relationships with temperature, showing the greatest
    difference between temperature scenarios. India is particularly vulnerable to
    increased river flooding and agricultural drought under higher temperature scenarios.
  12: The 1.5C scenario leads to higher global abatement costs compared to the 2C
    Central and NDC Pledges scenarios. The relationship between temperature pathways
    and transition risks is not fixed, varying by region and model.
  14: Single-model analysis can be situated within the broader ensemble of mitigation
    pathways from recent years; Uncertainty and more extreme values are likely to
    be critical to comprehensive risk assessments.
  15: Significant near-term transition risks to specific business sectors; more stringent
    mitigation action, the higher the abatement costs and sector-specific transition
    risks; scenarios with similar longer-term physical risks could have very different
    near-term transition risks.
  17: No relevant information
  29: Emissions intensity at sectoral levels is a central metric to benchmark company
    performance against transition scenarios.
  33: Drought and temperature changes impact maize yields, with drought potentially
    having a more significant effect on yields in water-limited regions than temperature.
Methodology:
  8: The analysis uses climate scenarios to project temperature changes based on different
    emission pathways.
  10: The framework normalizes physical risk metrics by values in 2050 with the 2C
    Central scenario. It assumes the significance of change is directly proportional
    to the change in the metric. The reference period for physical climate impacts
    is 1981-2010.
  12: The paper uses the GCAM model to project abatement costs under different climate
    scenarios. Results are applicable to 2030.
  14: Broad scenario sensitivity within a single model, systems modelling.
  15: Compares physical and transition risks; analysis focused on mid-century but
    salient for decisions today; explores multiple 2oC pathways.
  16: The paper describes an integrated scenario analysis framework built upon by
    stakeholders. It is a first step towards financial risk estimates, involving downscaling
    outputs from Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) to firm- and household-level
    risks. The results are applicable to different plausible emissions pathways.
  17: GCAM, MAGICC, and climate impact models were used; Scenario data analysis and
    visualisation were undertaken; Financial risk analysis and literature review was
    conducted
  19: The analysis uses indicators reported in IPCC scenario databases and NGFS results
    database to understand the macroeconomic risk affecting all production/consumption
    activities. Transition risk indicators are used to assess the risk of carbon leakage
    of sectors, mitigation feasibility, stranded asset analysis, and compare transitions
    to 1.5oC and 2oC in different shared socio-economic pathways
  27: Land-use change emissions are in addition to the constraint, and their price
    is determined as an exogenously specified proportion of the fossil emissions price.
  29: Draws from Integrated Assessment Model (IAM)-based indicators of feasibility
    of the transition.
  30: Uses GCAM version 5.1 for emissions scenarios; uses a probabilistic variant
    of MAGICC4.2 simple climate model to incorporate uncertainties into climate simulations;
    Perturbs equilibrium climate sensitivity, ocean mixing rate, and climate-carbon
    cycle feedback strength.
  31: Spatially-explicit global-scale impacts models are used to calculate seven hazard
    indicators. Damage functions relating each indicator to increase in global mean
    surface temperature are constructed from 23 CMIP5 climate models and combined
    with probability distributions of temperature change for given emissions scenarios.
    Damage functions are constructed separately for five SSP socio-economic scenarios
    and at 10-year increments.
  32: Uses climate scenarios applied to observed climate time series (1981-2010) with
    pattern-scaling. River flows are simulated using the Mac-PDM.09 global hydrological
    model. The Standardised Runoff Index (SRI) is used to define drought.
  33: Using Standardised Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI) to calculate agricultural
    drought. Calculating changes in growing degree-days for maize. Calculating likelihood
    of damaging temperatures during the maize reproductive phase.
More Notes:
  4: The framework allows for exploration of risks globally and in specific regions.
  8: The No Policy scenario is purely hypothetical and not an estimate of current
    emissions trends. The 1.5C scenario requires significant changes including phasing
    out fossil fuels in transport after 2050, rapid technology improvements, behaviour
    changes, and a phase out of F-gases. The 2C SSP3 scenario does not achieve a long-term
    temperature increase below 2oC with median likelihood due to a lack of land use
    policy, slower carbon and energy intensity improvements.
  10: The paper focuses on relative changes in risk compared to a 2C Central scenario,
    rather than absolute levels of risk. The results depend on the assumption of a
    linear or non-linear relationship between temperature increases and physical risk
    metrics.
  12: Abatement costs alone do not capture all macroeconomic consequences, as they
    may result in net investment, innovation, and growth stimulus.
  14: Futures analysis approaches beyond systems modelling could be beneficial to
    better populate the future possibility space, as well as considering extremes
    and traditionally under-represented disruptions.
  16: The analysis does not explicitly account for adaptation measures. The paper
    highlights the importance of considering systemic risk and networks of exposure
    to losses.
  17: The study involves scenario design and modelling protocol, suggesting a scenario-based
    analysis of climate change impacts; The use of GCAM suggests a focus on energy-economic
    pathways; The involvement of financial risk analysis indicates consideration of
    financial implications of climate change.
  29: The paper does not consider the potential stimulus effect of low-carbon investment
    on economic growth.
  30: The paper focuses on transition risks rather than physical climate risks.
  32: The analysis focuses on hazard expressed as annual likelihood (acute risk) and
    average annual number of people exposed (chronic risk), rather than direct macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes. The analysis uses a 0.5x0.5o grid and averages over areas
    with more than 1000 people.
  33: The area of cropland is assumed to remain unchanged over time. Focus is on maize
    as a proxy for agricultural impacts.
  34: This page primarily describes the scenario framework used in the paper, rather
    than presenting specific results. The authors expand on existing NGFS scenarios
    to explore a wider range of socio-economic conditions and disorderly transition
    pathways.

Quantitative material:
  4: Mentions temperature pathways spanning 1.5-4oC levels of long-term warming and
    time horizons of 2030 and 2050.
  8: "No Policy scenario: coal demand grows by 72%, oil by 58%, gas by 143% (2020-2100),\
    \ temperatures rise to 4.3oC by 2100. NDC Pledges: temperature projections rise\
    \ to 3.1oC by 2100. 1.5C scenario peaks at 1.7oC around 2050, returning to below\
    \ 1.5oC by 2080 and down to 1.3oC by 2100. 2C Central scenario keeps warming below\
    \ 2oC throughout the century, whilst the 2.5C scenario peaks less than 0.1\xB0\
    C above 2.5oC in 2090."
  12: Global abatement costs in 2030 are 1.6% of global GDP in the 1.5C scenario,
    0.6% in the 2C Central scenario, and 0.4% in the NDC Pledges scenario.

    5% of years. River flood: 2% annual likelihood. Water resources drought: occurs
    6.8% of the time during the reference period.'
  33: Significant drought defined as SPEI6 < -1.5 for at least three months. Reduction
    in crop growth duration of at least 10 days corresponds to an approximately 8%
    reduction in potential yield. Damaging temperatures defined as above 36 oC for
    at least five days during maize reproductive phase. 1981-2010 is used as a reference
    period.
