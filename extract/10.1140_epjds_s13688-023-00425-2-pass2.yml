Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature changes due to climate change.
  3: Temperature changes (impacts of climate change).
  4: Temperature and precipitation
  5: Temperature (Tir) and precipitation (Pir)
  6: Temperature (T) and Precipitation (P), including lagged effects
  7: Temperature, precipitation.
  8: Temperature rises are the drivers of risk.
  10: Temperature changes impacting per capita GDP growth.
  11: "Temperature increases (0.5\xB0C-6.5\xB0C)."
  13: Temperature rise is the primary driver impacting economic growth, as assessed
    by the changes in per capita GDP growth in different models.
  14: Temperature rise
  16: Temperature rise
  17: No relevant information
  18: Temperature changes; correlated time and climate variables
  19: "Temperature increases, specifically scenarios of 1\xB0C and 6\xB0C warming\
    \ relative to 2005 levels, are the drivers of risk."
  20: "Temperature changes due to climate warming (1\xB0C and 6\xB0C scenarios)"
  21: Temperature rise
  22: Temperature variations due to climate change
Highlights:
  1: "An optimal temperature of 15\xB0C, 15\xB0C or 21\xB0C for each model. Marginal\
    \ predictions of national GDP changes by approximately 1%, \u20133%, or \u2013\
    6% for models with 1\xB0C warming."
  3: Random Forests (RFs) indicate modest national GDP shifts (around 1%), while cubic
    and spline regressions suggest larger changes (-3% and -6%). RFs show more robust
    explanation and consistent stability but extrapolation poses a challenge.
  4: Temperature should be accounted for in economic projections under climate change.
    The research contributes to modeling methods in climate econometrics and quantifying
    the temperature impact on economic growth.
  6: The model considers both temperature and precipitation, their nonlinear effects,
    and lagged effects on per capita GDP growth.
  7: Random Forests (RFs) exhibit superior performance compared to other machine learning
    models. The paper focuses on presenting the results of RFs.
  8: The paper focuses on quantifying and mapping the impact of temperature rises
    on national and per capita GDP growth in China.
  10: "The mean impact of temperature effects on per capita GDP change shows an inverted\
    \ U-shaped trend with a peak at approximately 15\xB0C."
  11: "The paper finds an approximately 1% change in output due to temperature fluctuations,\
    \ based on their simulations. The linear simulation is for warming by 1\xB0C,\
    \ and the national GDP changes by 0.0087."
  13: The analysis indicates that warming predominantly benefits GDP growth in northern
    China, with areas of growth expanding from southern to northern China as temperatures
    rise.
  14: "The models have marginal predictions of a GDP change of approximately 1% in\
    \ RFs, \u20133% in cubic, and 6% in spline for warming below 6.5\xB0C. RFs outperform\
    \ traditional regressions in terms of R2, RMSE, MAE, and AIC."
  15: Random Forests (RFs) offer better model performance compared to cubic and spline
    regression methods in capturing complex and non-linear patterns, making them suitable
    for investigating climatic impacts on economic research.
  16: The marginal effect of temperature rise on national GDP accumulation varies
    depending on the modeling method used (traditional regressions vs. RFs). RFs show
    more stable results. Bootstrapping supports RFs as a good modeling method.
  17: Random Forests (RFs) have better prediction performance based on RMSE and R-squared.
    The bandwidths in the density plot suggest a consistency of performance in RFs.
    A similar result is shown in the boxplots considering the impact in the input
    sample.
  18: Random Forests (RFs) have a smaller loss in explanatory power and less reduction
    in prediction accuracy than traditional regression methods during the train-split
    process.
  19: Random Forests (RFs) have limited extrapolation ability and tend to predict
    an average of previously observed values when faced with unseen temperatures,
    causing their predicted values for per capita GDP growth to fall within the range
    of the training data. Traditional models (cubic regression and spline models)
    have direct extrapolation abilities that can extend beyond the training range.
    Traditional models can validate causal inferences before Random Forests are used.
  20: "Random Forests might underestimate the negative economic impact of climate\
    \ change. Extrapolation is a potential source of error in predicting the impact\
    \ of climate change, particularly under higher warming scenarios (6\xB0C)."
  21: "The study finds that a 1\xB0C temperature rise in China could lead to a 1%\
    \ (RF), -3% (cubic regression) or 6% (linear spline) change in national GDP."
  22: Incorporating temperature into economic projections is significant amidst climate
    change. Machine learning methods should be explored in climate impact analyses.
Methodology:
  1: Uses random forests, multivariate cubic regression, and linear spline regression
    to examine the direct impacts of temperature on economic development. The performance
    comparison suggests that random forests have stable model performance and better
    prediction performance in bootstrapping.
  3: Uses Random Forests (RFs), Multivariate Cubic Regression (cubic), and Linear
    Spline Regression (spline) to model the impact of temperature on economic development
    in China, using 1-degree latitude by 1-degree longitude sub-national quinquennial
    variations over 20 years (1985-2005).
  4: A Cobb-Douglas type production function (CD-C) is employed to model the relationship
    between temperature and per capita GDP growth in cells. The analysis uses data
    from 1985-2005 aggregated into 5-year intervals.
  5: Panel regressions are used to estimate the effects of temperature and precipitation
    on per capita GDP growth, controlling for cell and time fixed effects. The model
    examines the nonlinear impact of temperature and precipitation on economic activity.
    The regressions use the log first difference of the quinquennial per capita GDP.
  6: Panel regressions are used to model the impact of temperature and precipitation
    on per capita GDP growth, including fixed effects for cell and time. Lagged effects
    of temperature and precipitation are also considered.
  7: "Random Forests (RFs), Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM),\
    \ Support Vector Regression (SVR), cubic regression, and linear spline regression\
    \ are used to model the relationship between temperature and economic outcomes.\
    \ A train-test-split setting (80% training, 20% validation) is used for RFs. A\
    \ thought experiment is conducted where temperature is increased by \u03C4 \xB0\
    C among all cells, while other variables are held constant at their 2005 values."
  8: The impacts of temperature on national GDP growth are computed based on projected
    GDP changes in cells after temperature rises, using the formula in equation (17).
    The analysis examines geographic distribution using contour maps of per capita
    GDP growth. Random Forests (RFs) and benchmark regressions are used, with performance
    evaluated using R2, RMSE, MAE, and AIC.
  10: Analysis performed using random forests, polynomial regression (cubic), and
    linear spline regression focusing on temperature effects on GDP growth at the
    cell level with cell-fixed effects, year-fixed effects, and precipitation as controls.
  11: The paper conducts a thought experiment assuming equal temperature increases
    among all cells. It uses equations to simulate potential per capita GDP changes,
    aggregates GDP in cells to obtain national GDP, and compares outcomes with actual
    GDP in the base year to obtain national GDP change under the temperature rise
    scenario.
  13: The analysis is performed using econometric models, specifically RFs, cubic,
    and spline models, to estimate the impact of temperature rise on GDP growth at
    the cell level for a future date around 2080.
  14: Comparison of three models (Random Forests (RFs), cubic regression, and spline
    regression) to assess the impact of temperature rise on national and cell-level
    GDP in China. Out-of-box (OOB) data is used to validate model performance in prediction.
  15: The analysis uses Random Forests (RFs), multiple linear regression (cubic),
    and linear spline regression (spline) to evaluate model performance in predicting
    outcomes related to climate impacts with RFs showing better performance.
  16: Traditional regressions and Random Forests (RFs) are used to model the impact
    of temperature on GDP. Bootstrapping is used to simulate the impact of samples
    and test robustness on model performance.
  17: The paper uses bootstrapping (500 samples) to compare the performance of three
    models (random forests, cubic regression, and linear spline regression). It assesses
    performance via boxplots of training and testing errors and kernel densities of
    prediction errors. It also uses RMSE and R-squared to assess prediction performance.
  18: Compares Random Forests (RFs) with traditional regressions (cubic and spline)
    in the context of temperature-economic growth studies. Uses bootstrap with all
    and bootstrap with train splits to assess model performance.
  19: The study uses Random Forests (RFs), cubic regressions, and spline models to
    predict the impact of temperature increases on per capita GDP growth (gy). The
    applicability is limited by the extrapolation limitations of RFs, particularly
    for temperature values outside the training sample.
  20: The study uses traditional regressions and machine learning techniques (Random
    Forests, cubic splines) to predict per capita GDP growth under different warming
    scenarios, comparing predicted values against the range of the training data.
    Assesses the robustness of the model, including tests of serial correlation, cross-sectional
    independence, and heteroskedasticity.
  21: The authors used a thought experiment involving an equal temperature rise among
    cells (1-degree latitude by 1-degree longitude subnational quinquennial variations)
    and aggregated cell GDP to estimate the economic impact at a national level for
    China.
  22: Machine learning techniques are used to model the predictive impact of temperature
    on economic growth.
More Notes:
  1: "The extrapolation problem in random forests causes underestimation of climate\
    \ impact in 5% of cells under 6\xB0C warming. The study suggests considering temperature\
    \ in economic projections under climate change scenarios and the use of more machine\
    \ learning methods in climate impact assessment. The analysis uses subnational\
    \ data in China."
  3: Causality remains an issue for RFs and requires in-depth literature review and
    causality checks.
  4: The study uses geographically scaled economic data (GECON 4.0) and climate data
    from the CORDEX East Asia project. Raw economic data are winsorized to avoid the
    influence of extreme values.
  6: The paper uses five-year averages for the data.
  8: The paper uses a 'cell' based approach to model GDP, summing across all cells
    to determine national GDP. The R package ggplot2 is used for visualization.
  10: Empirical models do not include lagged effects and cover quinquennial variations
    between 1985 and 2005.
  14: "The optimal temperature for economic activity varies across models: approximately\
    \ 15\xB0C \u2013 16\xB0C for the cubic model and RFs, and 21\xB0C for the spline\
    \ model."
  16: The study investigates the lagged effects of climate variables (temperature
    and precipitation) on economic outcomes. The inclusion of lags does not significantly
    improve the overall explanatory ratio and model performance.
  17: The analysis investigates the impact of sample size on model performance. The
    bootstrap performance test includes sampling, splitting datasets, original dataset
    handling, performance computing, and testing/comparing with the original dataset.
  18: Applying tree-based regressions to amalgamate correlated time and climate variables
    may result in inaccuracies in estimating the climate sensitivity of economic growth
    due to challenges related to overfitting, the identification of trends in time
    series, and the absence of causality. The log-first difference is applied to remove
    time trends.
  19: The study compares the distribution of predicted per capita GDP growth values
    from RFs and traditional models to the training sample to assess the impact of
    extrapolation limitations. The training sample (N=2560) is used as a baseline
    for comparison.
  20: The study acknowledges limitations including a short time horizon, lack of spatial
    autocorrelation considerations, and lack of location-by-time dummies. Recommends
    regression-enhanced RFs or artificial neural networks with no direct constraints
    on extrapolation for future research.
  21: The Random Forest (RF) model is considered more reliable than cubic or linear
    spline regressions due to better performance and stability. Extrapolation beyond
    the sample temperature range leads to underestimation of the overall climate change
    economic impact. Causal inference should be validated by traditional methods before
    implementing RFs.
  22: The study uses the Geographically Scaled Economic Database (GEcon 4.0) and climate
    data from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) East
    Asia project. The study was supported by the National Key R&D program of China.
