Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased risks of wildfires as a consequence of climate change; Impact of burned
    areas.
  2: An increase in the frequency and severity of forest fires due to climate change,
    under the A1B scenario.
  3: Changes in climate, such as increased temperature and reduced precipitation,
    as well as increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves and forest fires.
  7: Burned areas, temperature, precipitation
  8: Burned areas, temperature increases, reduction in rainfall.
  9: Temperature (third quartile), Precipitation (third quartile)
  10: Increase in burned areas due to climate change, affecting the tourism sector
  11: Increased burned areas due to climate change (under A1B scenario)
  13: Increased burned areas due to fires.
  16: Wildfires impact tourism behaviors and arrivals.
Highlights:
  1: Finds a considerable negative impact of burned areas on the number of tourist
    arrivals (domestic and inbound); Projects significant increases in economic costs
    due to burned areas on tourism in Portugal in 2030 and 2050.
  2: Burned areas have a considerable negative impact on the number of tourist arrivals,
    with significant economic costs to the tourism sector.
  3: The paper emphasizes the link between climate change, increased temperatures,
    and forest fires in Portugal.
  7: 'Burned areas have a significant and persistent negative impact on both domestic
    and inbound tourism. The impact of burned areas is quite persistent: the current
    impact constitutes less than half of the total cumulative impact.'
  8: Burned areas negatively affect tourist arrivals, and this effect can persist
    into subsequent periods. Increased temperature and reduced rainfall lead to an
    increase in burned areas.
  9: Increased temperature leads to increased burned area, while increased precipitation
    leads to decreased burned area. Future projections indicate an increase in burned
    areas for most municipalities in Portugal, with some facing substantial increases
    by 2050.
  10: Burned area projections indicate a reduction in domestic tourist arrivals in
    many Portuguese municipalities in 2030 and 2050. The impact is spatially heterogeneous,
    with some municipalities benefiting and others experiencing reductions of varying
    degrees.
  11: Significant reductions in domestic and inbound tourist arrivals are projected
    in Portugal by 2030 and 2050 due to increased burned areas. The Porto and Lisbon
    metropolitan areas are particularly vulnerable. Hotel revenue losses are estimated.
  13: Burned areas have a negative and persistent impact on tourist arrivals in Portugal,
    reducing the number of visitors in the following periods. The study estimates
    the losses in tourist arrivals for each municipality in 2030 and 2050 under the
    A1B climate scenario.
  16: Significant negative impact of burned areas on tourist arrivals.
Methodology:
  1: Uses data for 278 municipalities in Portugal for the 2000-2016 period to estimate
    the impact of forest fires on tourism; Provides predictions for 2030 and 2050.
  2: The study uses data from 2000 to 2016 on 278 municipalities to estimate the impact
    of burned areas on tourist arrivals, providing predictions for 2030 and 2050.
  3: No specific methodology for analyzing macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes is described
    on this page.
  7: Uses data on tourist arrivals, burned areas, population density, and crime rate
    in 278 municipalities in Portugal from 2000 to 2016, combined with weather data.
    Employs a Heckman procedure to correct for non-random missing values.
  8: Regression analysis with fixed effects (Time, Municipality, and Municipality
    trend) to determine the impact of burned areas on tourist arrivals. Also regression
    analysis to model the impact of temperature and precipitation on burned areas.
    Projections for future temperature and precipitation are taken from Palma (2017)
    based on the A1B scenario (rapid economic growth, population peak in 2050, new
    technology, reduction in regional differences in per capita income).
  9: Regression analysis with time fixed effects, municipality fixed effects, and
    municipality trends, using data on 3,983 observations. The analysis uses the third
    quartile of temperature and precipitation.
  10: The study estimates the future cost for the tourism sector due to increased
    burned areas, focusing on domestic tourist arrivals. Results are based on the
    A1B scenario and are interpreted with respect to the average temperature and precipitation
    of the period studied.
  11: Projections based on burned area projections under the A1B scenario, related
    to average temperature and precipitation.
  13: Econometric model using municipality-level data in Portugal to quantify the
    impact of burned areas on tourist arrivals. Burned area projections for the A1B
    scenario in 2030 and 2050 are used. Robustness checks include introducing temperature
    and precipitation variables and using Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) to
    address simultaneity bias.
  16: Fixed-effects panel data analysis with robust standard errors accounting for
    heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation, and spatial correlation.
More Notes:
  3: Tourism is highlighted as significant for the economy, contributing substantially
    to GDP and exports.
  7: The lag of the dependent variable (tourist arrivals) is significant, suggesting
    a 'word of mouth' effect.
  8: The analysis focuses on Portugal.
  9: The analysis initially included wind speed, but this variable was excluded due
    to illogical results, potentially due to a lack of control for wind direction.
    The R-squared value for the regression is 0.18.
  10: The focus is exclusively on domestic tourism, and the analysis simplifies the
    exposure of results for each municipality using figures.
  11: Some municipalities may benefit from weather condition changes, but the number
    is small and decreases over time. The greatest impacts are observed in the Porto
    metropolitan area and municipalities near Spain.
  13: The results represent lower bound estimates as they only consider tourist arrivals
    and not other affected sectors.

    at a local level, and does not discuss macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes,
    nor nation-wide adaptation costs/benefits.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Estimated annual costs to the Portuguese economy due to the impact of burned
    areas on tourism (domestic and inbound).
  2: Estimated annual costs to the Portuguese economy due to increased burned areas
    range between e17.03 and e24.18 million for domestic tourist arrivals and between
    e18.26 and e38.08 million for inbound tourist arrivals in 2030, with costs increasing
    by at least a factor of four by 2050.
  3: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes related to climate change adaptation
    are explicitly mentioned.
  7: Number of domestic and inbound tourist arrivals
  8: Negative impact of burned areas on the number of tourist arrivals (both domestic
    and inbound).
  9: Share of burned area
  10: Impacts on domestic tourist arrivals
  11: Reduction in domestic and inbound tourist arrivals, losses of Hotels' Revenues
  13: Losses in domestic and inbound tourism.
Quantitative material:
  1: Estimated annual costs to the Portuguese economy due to burned areas in 2030
    range between e17.03 and 24.18 million for domestic tourist arrivals and between
    e18.26 and 38.08 million for inbound ones; in 2050, those costs will increase
    at least fourfold.
  2: Predicted reduction in domestic and inbound tourist arrivals in Portugal by 2030
    is up to 2% and 0.5%, respectively, worsening to 2-4% and 0.5-1% by 2050.
  3: Forest fires have burned about 40% of Portugal from 1975 to 2007.
  7: A 1 per cent increase in burned areas in a given year reduces the number of domestic
    and inbound tourist arrivals in that year and in the following year by 3.53 and
    1.12 per cent, respectively.
  8: "A 1% increase in burned area leads to a statistically significant decrease in\
    \ tourist arrivals (coefficients of -1.6634 and -0.4199 are reported, with significance\
    \ levels of 5% and 10% respectively), temperature increases of 1\xB0C during the\
    \ third quarter increases the share of burned areas by 0.14 per cent, and a reduction\
    \ in the amount of rainfall by 10 mm increases the share of burned areas by 0.1\
    \ per cent. These weather factors contribute to an additional 12,909 and 9,921\
    \ hectares burned, respectively."
  9: A 0.0014 increase in the share of burned area for each unit increase in temperature
    (significant at the 5% level) and a -0.0001 decrease in the share of burned area
    for each unit increase in precipitation (significant at the 10% level). Majority
    of municipalities will face a 0-0.5 percent increase in burned areas and a few
    will face a 1-1.32 percent increase in 2030 and the situation will be exaggerated
    in 2050.
  10: 'In 2030, 193 municipalities will face a reduction in domestic tourist arrivals
    in the 0-2% range, 74 in the 2-4% range, and 1 in the above 4% range. Some municipalities
    benefit from climate change in 2030 but fewer do so in 2050. Specific numbers
    for the benefits in 2030 (largest: 1.086 percentage points, smallest: 0.10 percentage
    points, mean: 0.47 percentage points) and 2050 (largest: 0.816, smallest: 0.05
    and 0.26, respectively) are reported for municipalities that benefit.'
  11: Projected reduction ranges for domestic tourist arrivals in 2030 and 2050 (0-2%,
    2-4%, >4% for domestic; -0.35-0%, 0-0.5%, 0.5-1%, 1-1.48% for inbound). Number
    of municipalities affected within each range. Estimates of Hotels' Revenue losses
    under 'Realistic' scenarios in 2030 and 2050 (2.6% and 5.7%).
  13: Losses in 2030 range between 0.59 and 0.84 percent for domestic tourism and
    between 0.63 and 1.31 percent for inbound tourism compared to 2016 hotel revenues;
    losses increase by a factor of about three for domestic tourist arrivals and about
    six for inbound tourist arrivals in 2050. Majority of municipalities will face
    a 0-2 percent reduction in domestic tourist arrivals in 2030 and a 2-4 percent
    reduction in 2050. The reduction in inbound tourist arrivals will range between
    0-0.5 percent in 2030 and 0.5-1 percent in 2050.
