Drivers of Risk:
  1: "1997/98 El Ni\xF1o and positive Indian Ocean Dipole event causing a major ecosystem\
    \ shift; shift of upwelling off the Kenyan coast into Tanzanian waters; anomalous\
    \ wind stress curl over the central Indian Ocean."
  2: Climate change, unsustainable exploitation of living marine resources, poleward
    redistribution of marine species, changes in coastal upwelling systems, oceanic
    warming.
  10: "Super El Ni\xF1o and IOD+ events, specifically the 1997/98 event, causing reorganization\
    \ of surface circulation in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) and displacement of\
    \ the NKBs upwelling."
  11: "Changes in ocean temperature, productivity, El Ni\xF1o, and IOD+ (Indian Ocean\
    \ Dipole)."
Highlights:
  1: "A major ecosystem shift occurred in coastal East African waters during the 1997/98\
    \ Super El Ni\xF1o, leading to a southward migration of the Somali\u2013Zanzibar\
    \ confluence zone and altered chlorophyll-a levels, potentially impacting fisheries\
    \ and food security in Kenya and Tanzania."
  2: Climate change and unsustainable practices threaten living marine resources and
    food security in the Western Indian Ocean, potentially exacerbating resource-use
    conflicts.
  10: The 1997/98 event led to a unique reorganization of surface circulation in the
    WIO, causing an unprecedented displacement of the NKBs upwelling from Kenyan national
    waters to south of Zanzibar Island in Tanzanian national waters, with negative
    impacts on local fish stocks at the NKBs.
  11: An Early Warning System using near real-time altimetry fields could warn users
    of unusual SEC (South Equatorial Current) patterns and impending low productivity,
    leading to potentially lower fish catches, up to three months in advance.
Methodology:
  1: "Combination of remote sensing and ocean modeling to show how a stable seasonal\
    \ upwelling shifted; comparison of 1997/98 El Ni\xF1o with other super El Ni\xF1\
    o events (1972,73, 1982\u201383 and 2015\u201316)."
  2: Uses remote sensing data and modelling to analyze sea surface temperature and
    chlorophyll-a concentrations to understand ecosystem changes and fish populations.
  10: "Combination of marine technologies to investigate the effects of the super\
    \ El Ni\xF1o and IOD+ events of 1997/98 on the NKB upwelling."
  11: Using satellite remote sensing data to detect regime shifts in ocean currents
    and productivity.
More Notes:
  1: The paper discusses how satellite observations may assist fisheries management
    bodies to anticipate low productivity periods and mitigate their potentially negative
    economic impacts.
  2: Focuses on the Western Indian Ocean, particularly Kenya and Tanzania, and mentions
    specific events like the eastward movement of anchovy biomass in South Africa.
  10: The study suggests a temporary relief from widespread warming and low productivity
    in Tanzania due to the upwelling cell near Zanzibar, but notes conflicting reports
    on fisheries catch during the 1997-98 period. The primary cause for the substantial
    decrease in recreational fish catch by tourists in the NKBs in 1997/98 was attributed
    to a reduction in coastal tourism following political riots.
  11: "The 1997/98 El Ni\xF1o event may provide a benchmark for assessing how equatorial\
    \ teleconnections associated with IOD and ENSO may affect the productivity of\
    \ the East African coast during future similar extreme events."

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Negative impacts on local fish stocks in Kenya, affecting fishers' livelihoods
    and food security; temporary increase in pelagic fishery species' productivity
    in Tanzania; potentially negative economic impacts from low productivity periods.
  2: Food insecurity growth in East African countries, fisheries conflicts, economic
    activity impacts surrounding fisheries in coastal cities.
  10: "Negative impacts on local fish stocks at the North Kenya Banks (NKBs) and potential\
    \ increase in pelagic fishery species\u2019 productivity near Zanzibar."
  11: "Changes in fishery catches and associated loss of revenues affecting fishers\u2019\
    \ livelihoods and food security."
Quantitative material:
  1: "Observed lowest chlorophyll-a over the North Kenya banks (Kenya) and historical\
    \ maximum off Dar Es Salaam (Tanzanian waters) during the 1997/98 El Ni\xF1o event."
  10: Around a 36% drop in catch rates of five commonly used artisanal gears in Mombasa
    between 1995 and 1998.
  11: "Sizeable temperature anomalies associated with a significant reduction in the\
    \ NKBs upwelling due to the occurrence of a super El-Ni\xF1o."
