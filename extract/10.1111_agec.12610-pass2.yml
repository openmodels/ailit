Drivers of Risk:
  1: Floods
  6: Flood exposure, experiences of insecurity or violence, unusually high increases
    in food prices
  8: Floods and conflict are common in the study area, contributing to negative impacts.
  9: Flood, violence, price shock, rural location.
  10: Flood exposure in the 12 months before the interview; Price shock.
  11: Exposure to floods and price shocks at the household level
  12: Floods, Price Shocks
  13: Floods and price shocks
  14: Flood events, violence, and income per capita.
  15: Flood-induced impairment of livelihood, such as loss of livestock, agricultural
    production, and employment, increased poverty risks.
  16: Flooding effect.
  18: Floods
Highlights:
  1: Floods negatively impact food security (calorie and micronutrient consumption)
    and household income, increasing poverty in Afghanistan. Coping strategies include
    buying food on credit and taking loans.
  6: Exploration of the nexus between floods, nutritional consumption, coping strategies,
    and the impact of floods on household income and poverty status
  8: Households affected by floods are worse off in terms of calories and micronutrient
    consumption/deficiency.
  9: Flood affected populations experience significantly lower Kcal/pc, Iron/pc, and
    Vit. A/pc, and Vit. C/pc, as well as significantly higher deficiencies in Kcal,
    Iron, Vit. A, and Vit. C, compared to non-flood-affected populations. Violence,
    price shocks, and rural locations are also associated with food security differences.
  10: Flood exposure has a statistically significant negative impact on calorie consumption
    per capita and increases the likelihood of calorie deficiency.
  11: Flood exposure in Afghanistan increases the likelihood of poverty and decreases
    per capita yearly income at the household level.
  12: Floods have a statistically significant negative effect on vitamin A and C consumption
    per capita, and a statistically significant positive effect on vitamin A and C
    deficiency. Price shocks have a statistically significant negative effect on Vitamin
    C consumption per capita and a statistically significant positive effect on Vitamin
    C deficiency.
  13: Floods have a statistically significant positive impact on poverty. Price shocks
    also have a statistically significant positive impact on poverty.
  14: Flood exposure has a statistically significant positive effect on the probability
    of households adopting coping strategies such as skipping meals, reducing diet
    quality, taking out loans, using credit, selling assets, and seeking community
    help.
  15: Flooding significantly affects both calorie and micronutrient consumption; it
    also increases the probability of falling below the poverty line.
  16: Interventions are more effective when based on mitigation policies already in
    place before the shock occurs.
  18: The study provides evidence on the impact of floods on food security and coping
    strategies in Afghanistan.
Methodology:
  1: Instrumental variable approach to data from the Afghanistan National Risk and
    Vulnerability Assessment survey. Results are applicable to Afghanistan.
  6: Analysis performed using an instrumental variable approach correlating flood
    exposure without affecting outcome variables, and 2SLS framework to address endogeneity,
    with basic OLS models controlling for confounders
  8: The analysis uses a 2SLS strategy to address erroneous inclusion of resilient
    households in the control group, and includes falsification tests to check instrument
    exogeneity.
  9: The paper compares food security outcomes between flood-affected and non-flood-affected
    groups, using statistical tests of differences in means. The time frame or geographic
    focus of the data is not evident from this page.
  10: Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) regressions using NRVA 2011-12 data. The analysis
    controls for household characteristics, topography, and province fixed effects,
    and uses sampling survey weights. Standard errors are clustered at the district
    level.
  11: The analysis uses 2SLS regressions based on NRVA 2011-12 data for Afghanistan,
    controlling for household characteristics, topography, and province fixed effects,
    with standard errors clustered at the district level. Poverty status is calculated
    using a cost of basic needs approach.
  12: The analysis uses 2SLS (Two-Stage Least Squares) regression on NRVA 2011-12
    data, controlling for household characteristics, topography fixed effects, and
    province fixed effects. The standard errors are clustered at the district level
    and regressions are estimated using sampling survey weights.
  13: The analysis uses 2SLS (two-stage least squares) regressions based on NRVA 2011-12
    data. The regressions control for household characteristics, topography, and province
    fixed effects, and are estimated using sampling survey weights. Standard errors
    are clustered at the district level.
  14: The analysis uses Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions on NRVA 2011-12 data
    for Afghanistan. The regressions control for household characteristics, topography,
    and province fixed effects and use sampling survey weights. Standard errors are
    clustered at the district level.
  15: The analysis acknowledges the limitations of measuring flood severity and exposure,
    using self-reported data, and employs a 2SLS approach to reduce bias.
  16: Empirical analysis needed to uncover the dynamics between risk exposure and
    adaptation to or coping with climate change outcomes.
  18: The study examines the relationship between floods, food security, and coping
    strategies in Afghanistan.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the impact of floods on food security and household income,
    rather than macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes directly.
  6: Study assumes quasi-random occurrence of floods, controls for possible confounders
    at both household and community levels
  9: The table also includes instrumental variable (IV), household characteristics,
    and coping strategies as independent variables. It's not clear if this analysis
    is specifically focused on macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, it seems more
    focused on household-level food security. The 'a', 'b', and 'c' superscripts next
    to some variables suggest that there are corresponding notes to this table.
  11: The paper suggests that selection bias is unlikely to be a major problem for
    their Afghan sample.
  12: The analysis focuses on the impact of floods and price shocks on household nutritional
    outcomes (vitamin A and C consumption and deficiency) rather than on broad macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes.
  13: The results are based on data from Afghanistan. OLS estimates are also provided
    in the online appendix and compared to the 2SLS results.
  14: The study focuses on the impact of floods on household coping strategies, providing
    insights into micro-level responses to climate-related shocks. The flood variable
    is a dummy variable indicating whether the household was negatively affected by
    a flood in the past year. The results are applicable to the context of Afghanistan
    in 2011-2012.
  16: The World Bank Afghanistan Disaster Risk Management and Resilience Program has
    implemented an irrigation restoration and development project, as well as an Afghanistan
    rural access project.

Quantitative material:
  1: Exposure to flooding during a 12-month period decreased daily calorie consumption
    by approximately 60 kcal while increasing the probability of iron, vitamin A,
    and vitamin C deficiency by 11, 12, and 27 percentage points, respectively. Exposure
    to flooding decreases income by about 3% and makes flood-affected households about
    3 percentage points more likely to be poor.
  6: No relevant information
  8: 22.3% of households do not meet the daily minimum calorie requirement; 67% and
    46% of households show vitamin A and C deficiency, respectively.
  10: Flood exposure is associated with a statistically significant decrease in Kcal/pc
    consumption (-69.334, p<0.01 and -57.183, p<0.01 in different model specifications).
    Flood exposure is associated with a statistically significant increase in Kcal
    deficiency (0.017, p<0.05 in one model specification).
  11: Households exposed to floods in the year before the interview are 2.5-3.1 percentage
    points more likely to be deemed poor. Flood exposure decreases per capita yearly
    income by around 3%.
  12: Yes, the tables provide quantitative estimates of the impact of floods and price
    shocks on vitamin A and C consumption and deficiency. Specifically, the tables
    show coefficients, standard errors, and significance levels for the impact of
    these variables on per capita vitamin consumption and deficiency rates.
  13: A flood increases poverty (measured using a cost of basic needs approach) by
    2.5-3.1 percentage points. A price shock increases poverty by 8.1-9.7 percentage
    points. Income per capita (measured in Afghani per capita per year) has a negative
    effect on poverty.
  14: Table 7 provides coefficients from OLS regressions showing the effect of flood
    exposure on the probability of adopting different coping strategies. For example,
    flood exposure increases the probability of skipping meals by 0.024 (significant
    at the 5% level), reducing diet quality by 0.106 (significant at the 1% level),
    taking out loans by 0.074 (significant at the 1% level), using credit by 0.049
    (significant at the 1% level), selling assets by 0.024 (significant at the 5%
    level), and receiving community help by 0.025 (significant at the 10% level).
