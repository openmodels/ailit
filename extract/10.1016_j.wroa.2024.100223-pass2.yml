Drivers of Risk:
  1: Water scarcity driven by climate change, specifically through insufficient rainfall
    or drought, impacts economic sectors reliant on water.
  2: Temporary water scarcity events, specifically a single month-long event in May
    and a scenario with water scarcity in both May and August.
  4: The analysis examines the impact of drought conditions and water scarcity.
  5: Temporal water scarcity events.
  6: Month-long water scarcity events in May, and in both May and August, with the
    latter being more severe.
  7: The driver of risk is temporal water scarcity events.
  9: Reduced freshwater availability during water scarcity events is the primary driver
    impacting agriculture, chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing, and electricity
    generation sectors.

Evaluation overview:
  1: The paper provides an overview of the socio-economic impacts of water scarcity
    on sectors like agriculture, food, and electricity production, assessing the broader
    economic resilience.
  2: Macro-level socio-economic impacts of water scarcity, specifically impacts on
    GDP, investment, employment, and water use.
  4: The analysis focuses on the effects of varying levels of investment foresight
    on economic resilience in the face of water scarcity, considering GDP, employment,
    and water use.
  5: Impact of different investment behavior models on sector effects of GDP, investment,
    and water use during temporal water scarcity events.
  6: Economic resilience to water scarcity.
  7: This page evaluates the impact of water scarcity on GDP, employment, and water
    use in Germany.
  9: The document provides an overview of the impacts on GDP, employment, and water
    use across various sectors during a temporal water scarcity event.

Highlights:
  1: Sectors like agriculture, food, and electricity production could face negative
    impacts from water scarcity, but some sectors may benefit from competitiveness
    effects.
  2: The study investigates how different investment behaviors (perfect foresight,
    myopic expectations, and imperfect foresight) affect the macro-economy during
    and after temporary water scarcity. It highlights the importance of proactive
    measures and quantifies the varying outcomes of investment strategies at the individual
    sector level.
  4: Firms with foresight perform better during water scarcity events. Some sectors
    benefit from competitiveness effects, cushioning adverse economic implications
    but potentially increasing water use via catch-up effects. Agriculture, food,
    and electricity sectors are negatively impacted by drought. Policies promoting
    anticipation and preparedness among firms are recommended.
  5: Most impacts appear negative, as indicated by the dominance of red and orange
    shades in the chart showing sector effects. The model incorporates two types of
    water - green (Wg) and blue (Wb) - and three types of land capital - crops (Tc),
    pastures (Tp), and other (To).
  6: Simulates the impact of water scarcity events on the German economy under different
    investment behavior assumptions.
  7: The level of economic openness (Armington elasticity) has a relatively small
    effect on the overall results, primarily influencing the magnitude of the impacts.
    Higher economic openness tends to have a slight positive effect on GDP and water
    usage, but a negative impact on employment. Firms with perfect foresight perform
    better than those with myopic or imperfect foresight. Imperfect foresight leads
    to over-investment and the most significant negative impacts.
  9: Agriculture is the most affected sector due to its high reliance on freshwater,
    while industries like electrical and vehicle manufacturing experience some positive
    effects due to changes in consumer spending.

Methodology:
  1: The analysis uses a dynamic multisectoral model, incorporating behavioural and
    resilience aspects to assess the socio-economic effects of water scarcity.
  2: Uses the DEMACRO-ESS model, a general equilibrium (CGE) model focused on Germany,
    to simulate the impact of water scarcity under different investment behavior specifications
    (perfect foresight, myopic expectations, and imperfect foresight). Results applicable
    to Germany, potentially indicative for other European nations. Simulations use
    monthly time steps.
  4: The analysis is based on a custom-built dynamic multi-sectoral CGE model called
    DEMACRO-ESS, parameterized on a 2020 Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for Germany
    at monthly frequency. It explores potential future events and government policies
    through controlled experimentation and sensitivity analysis.
  5: DEMACRO-ESS simulation; nested Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production
    functions; Armington links for trade and intermediates; Leontief coefficients
    for intermediate purchases; incorporates green and blue water, and crop, pasture,
    and other land types as natural capital.
  6: "Computable general equilibrium (CGE) modelling analysis using the AMOS modelling\
    \ framework, with three investment behavior models (perfect foresight, myopic,\
    \ imperfect foresight) resulting in six comprehensive sets of simulation results.\
    \ Scenarios are incorporated by introducing reduction in water efficiency (\u03C8\
    \ W,i in Eq. (1)) for the respective months."
  7: The analysis uses the DEMARCO-ESS model and varying Armington trade elasticities
    to conduct a sensitivity analysis, applicable to understanding the impact of water
    scarcity in Germany under different levels of economic openness.
  9: 'The analysis uses the DEMACRO-ESS simulation model with three different investment
    scenarios: Myopic, Imperfect foresight, and Perfect foresight.'

More Notes:
  2: The paper focuses on engineering resilience. It acknowledges limitations of myopic
    models and highlights the value of foresight models. It integrates an imperfectly
    competitive labor market closure that allows for wage bargaining behavior.
  4: The model considers neo-Keynesian characteristics. Results should be interpreted
    as scenarios rather than precise predictions. The analysis could be improved by
    extending it to a multi-country context.
  5: Investment behavior models considered are Myopic (MY), Imperfect foresight (IM),
    and Perfect foresight (PE).
  6: The labor force is fixed, but employment is variable. A bargained real wage function
    is used to reflect behavioral aspects within the aggregate labor market.
  7: The analysis assumes business-as-usual conditions for Germany's trade partners,
    which may not be valid if neighboring countries are also experiencing water scarcity.
  9: The indirect impacts of water scarcity show that sectors not reliant on freshwater
    can still be significantly affected due to their interconnectedness with agriculture.
