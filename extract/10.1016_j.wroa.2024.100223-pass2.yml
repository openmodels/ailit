Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change driven water scarcity; Insufficient rainfall or drought; High
    consumption of water relative to its availability.
  2: Temporary water scarcity events.
  3: 'Temporal water scarcity events (droughts) are the shocks impacting the outcomes,
    with two scenarios: Scenario 1 (initial shock) and Scenario 2 (more severe shock
    after the initial one).'
  4: Water scarcity events (droughts)
  5: Temporal water scarcity events.
  6: Water scarcity scenarios are a key driver of risk, affecting water efficiency
    and economic resilience.
  8: Temporal water scarcity event
  9: Temporal water scarcity event.
Highlights:
  1: Firms' foresight (or lack thereof) impacts their response to water scarcity and
    the subsequent impact on the economy; Prioritizing resilience-building measures
    in all sectors is crucial.
  2: The type of investment behavior (perfect foresight, myopic expectations, imperfect
    foresight) significantly influences the quantitative effects and adjustment paths
    following water scarcity events.
  3: Temporal water scarcity leads to declines in GDP, investment, employment, and
    water use. The magnitude of these declines varies depending on the severity of
    the shock (Scenario 1 vs. Scenario 2) and the investment behavior model used (Myopic,
    Imperfect Foresight, Perfect Foresight). Firms with imperfect foresight can overestimate
    output in previous periods leading to over-investment that impacts GDP.
  4: Firms with foresight perform better during water scarcity events; Agriculture,
    food, and electricity sectors are consistently negatively impacted; Motor vehicle
    sector benefits from competitiveness effects, but contributes to increased water
    use; Foresight mitigates negative effects of water scarcity.
  5: Agriculture has a significant negative impact across all metrics (GDP, employment,
    water use) during temporal water scarcity events. The impact on other sectors
    varies.
  6: Two scenarios of water scarcity are tested, with decreases in water efficiency
    by 30% and 35% for specific months.
  8: Agriculture, forestry & fishing sector experiences the most significant negative
    impact on GDP, employment and water use. Impacts vary based on the investment
    behavior model used (MY, IM, PE).
  9: Agriculture is the most heavily affected sector. Chemical and pharmaceutical
    manufacturing and electricity generation are also significantly negatively impacted,
    but to a lesser extent than agriculture. Food and beverage industries are indirectly
    affected due to their reliance on agricultural inputs. Electrical manufacturing
    and vehicle manufacturing may experience positive effects.
Methodology:
  1: Custom-built dynamic multisectoral model; Incorporates often overlooked factors
    such as behavioural and resilience aspects; Sector-specific analyses.
  2: Uses a general equilibrium (CGE) model called DEMACRO-ESS specifically focused
    on Germany to simulate the macro-economic impacts of water scarcity under different
    investment behaviors (perfect foresight, myopic expectations, and imperfect foresight).
  3: DEMACRO-ESS simulation with different investment behaviour model specifications
    (Myopic, Imperfect foresight, and Perfect foresight). The results provide information
    on selected time periods and present cumulative impacts by summing across all
    time periods, measuring percentage changes from base year.
  4: Dynamic multi-sectoral CGE model (DEMACRO-ESS) parameterized on a 2020 Social
    Accounting Matrix (SAM) for Germany, with monthly frequency.
  5: Uses the DEMACRO-ESS model, which is an extension of the DEMACRO model, a multi-sector,
    dynamic, general equilibrium model for Germany. Production takes place in perfectly
    competitive industries using multi-level production functions with constant elasticity
    of substitution (CES) technology. Land and water are included as natural capital
    in the production function. Export demand is modeled with conventional export
    demand functions.
  6: The analysis uses an economic model incorporating changes in water efficiency
    and fixed labour supply, with real wage behavior and investment scenarios under
    myopic and perfect foresight closures.
  8: DEMACRO-ESS simulation results are presented, modelling different investment
    behaviours (Myopic, Imperfect foresight, Perfect foresight) during a temporal
    water scarcity event to estimate sectoral impacts on GDP, employment, and water
    use.
  9: DEMACRO-ESS simulation results are used to model the sectoral effects of a temporal
    water scarcity event under different investment behavior assumptions. Results
    are applicable to analyzing the impact of water scarcity on specific industries.
More Notes:
  1: "The paper focuses on resilience in relation to the economy\u2019s capacity to\
    \ recover after a disturbance; Policymakers are urged to shift from short-term\
    \ focused strategies towards long-term approaches to effectively manage water\
    \ scarcity; The analysis provides a more comprehensive understanding of the system-wide\
    \ implications of water scarcity on the broader economy."
  2: The model incorporates ecosystem services (ESS), primarily water and land, and
    allows for wage bargaining behavior in an imperfectly competitive labour market.
    The qualitative findings and policy recommendations can be seen as indicative
    for other European nations and regions, despite the empirical model focusing on
    Germany.
  3: Recovery time for GDP is approximately ten time periods, driven by increased
    investment. Imperfect foresight firms have a slower recovery and lower average
    GDP compared to myopic expectations. The graphs (noted as present) illustrate
    the modeled impact of shocks on economic and resource variables under two different
    scenarios over time, providing a visual comparison of changes in GDP, investment,
    and water use.
  4: The analysis considers behavioral aspects of firms' investment decisions (foresight)
    and their impact on economic resilience.
  5: 'The model incorporates different investment behavior models: Myopic (MY), Imperfect
    Foresight (IM), and Perfect Foresight (PE).'
  8: The table presents cumulative percentage changes across all simulation periods.  The
    simulation focuses on sectoral impacts.
  9: The magnitude of the impacts varies based on the investment behavior model used
    (Myopic, Imperfect Foresight, Perfect Foresight).
