Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Air temperature changes (increasing trend up to 0.52\xB0C/decade in major Polish\
    \ cities)."
Highlights:
  1: Mean daily temperature in Polish cities is increasing significantly. This reduces
    heating demand, but increases cooling needs and affects the operation, capacity,
    and efficiency of renewable energy sources. The effects are stronger on the demand
    side than on the supply side.
Methodology:
  1: "Statistical analysis of historical mean daily temperature observed in 19 major\
    \ Polish cities over the 1968\u20132018 period; Qualitative analysis of the potential\
    \ impact of temperature trends on renewable energy sources."
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the impact of temperature changes on renewable energy in
    Poland, affecting heating and cooling demand, electrical load, and the renewables
    working conditions.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: "The mean daily temperature in all major Polish cities is exhibiting a statistically\
    \ significant increasing trend, up to 0.52 \xB0C/decade over the 1968\u20132018\
    \ period."
