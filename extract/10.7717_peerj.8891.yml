  41: Estimation of net ecosystem carbon exchange for the conterminous United States
Highlights:
  1: The Direct Measurement Forest Carbon Protocol reduces risk of voluntary and compliance
    market products worldwide to assist in the management of global warming.
  2: Multinational policy applications such as the Paris Agreement and the United
    Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, constrained by
    Kyoto Protocol era processes, will benefit from NEE measurement avoiding unsupported
    claims of emission reduction, fraud, and forest conservation policy failure.
  3: The paper's objective is to efficiently monetize sustainable forest management
    and provide direct revenue to landowners and communities in lieu of deforestation.
    The DMFCP aims to commercialize large-scale, direct measurement of forest CO2
    fluxes.
  4: The DMFCP facilitates the measurement, verification, and registration of net
    forest carbon sequestration for carbon trading and reporting.
  6: "Direct field measurements of NEE relative to a zero-emission baseline, annual\
    \ accreditation periods, and a pooled portfolio approach for carbon offsetting.\
    \ Negative NEE indicates a CO\u2082 sink and results in carbon credits or offsets."

    revenue scenarios for large-scale projects with carbon pricing.
  8: No relevant information
  10: No relevant information
  11: HF and AP sites showed active forest carbon sequestration and generation of
    carbon credits. Annual NEE values were negative over the intervals studied.
  14: The page highlights the importance of independent validation, strict measurement
    protocols, and eliminating risk/uncertainty in carbon offset projects. Key goals
    are to attain balance in forest carbon, achieve net-positive results, and prevent
    fraudulent claims.
  15: The paper emphasizes the benefit of net-negative carbon projects and the value
    of expanding landowner knowledge of GHG impacts and management options. Also mentions
    that the method offer options for any iso- to the method creating new product
    categories.
  16: All GHG flux data are relevant to climate activity.
  17: The Ankasa Park site shows consistently greater carbon sequestration than the
    Harvard Forest in the observed period, with both sites indicating an increase
    in CO2 absorption over time.
  18: Landowner revenue varies substantially based on carbon price, forest site (Harvard
    Forest vs. Ankasa Park), and payment structure (upfront vs. royalty). Ankasa park
    presents higher cashflows compared to Harvard Forest
  19: Higher potential revenue from mixed carbon products and pricing for voluntary,
    compliance, and regulatory markets at different sequestration rates.
  20: The combination of different carbon products and pricing strategies maximizes
    revenue potential.
  21: A Dynamic Multi-resource Forest Carbon Products (DMFCP) model may provide financial
    incentives for landowners to engage in reforestation and forest management, potentially
    offsetting deforestation and anthropogenic disturbance. The proposed financial
    structure can benefit landowner property valuation and reduces cost of delayed
    reforestation.
  22: The approach is a game-changer for creation and verification of forest carbon
    financial products compared to estimation and model simulation-based protocols.
  23: DMFCP eliminates the need for baseline estimation, additionality tests, and
    multiyear invalidation periods, and allows for direct measurement which provides
    near-real time NEE time series and trends.
  24: Traditional forest carbon protocols are inadequate for determining when a forest
    project switches to net positive emissions on an annual basis. Traditional forest
    carbon protocols are cumbersome and lengthy to establish offset transactions,
    and financially inviable to compete with deforestation.
  25: Traditional forest carbon protocols have shortcomings because they were developed
    for forests, use timber management methodology, and primarily capture above ground
    carbon. Algorithms developed for forest CO2 are not readily applicable to other
    GHG species and diverse biospheric landscapes. Estimation of national emission
    inventories are flawed and inaccurate.
  26: The DMFCP offers a commercial standardized measurement-to-monetization system
    for determining NEE, contributing to large-scale forest conservation and reforestation.
  27: The paper discloses a series of patents held by B. D. V. Marino related to 'System
    of systems for monitoring greenhouse gas fluxes' and 'System and methods for managing
    global warming'.
Methodology:
  1: The Direct Measurement Forest Carbon Protocol TM is based on standardized methods
    for direct determination of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 employing eddy
    covariance, a meteorological approach integrating forest carbon fluxes; uses analyzers
    for CO2 isotopologues (e.g., 12CO2, 13CO2, 14CO2) and greenhouse gases deployed
    across the project landscape. Uses published annual NEE data for a tropical (Ankasa
    Park, Ghana, Africa) and a deciduous forest (Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA, USA)
    to forecast carbon revenue.
  2: Argues that current forest carbon estimation protocols do not directly observe
    forest CO2 fluxes, relying instead on forest mensuration and tree growth simulation
    models to infer annual changes in net forest carbon offsets.
  3: The paper proposes a Direct Measurement Forest Carbon Protocol (DMFCP) that uses
    direct, in-situ measurement of vertical gross forest CO2 fluxes (photosynthesis
    and ecosystem respiration) to determine net forest carbon sequestration (NEE).
    This is contrasted with estimation-based protocols. It mentions using a network
    system architecture (SoS) and a sensor platform (GMP) for carbon accounting from
    measurement-to-monetization of NEE based products.
  4: The DMFCP uses in situ measurements of forest carbon gross fluxes (GPP, R_eco)
    via a sensor network (SoS) and remote sensing to determine NEE. This data is combined
    with spatial and temporal information (Project Carbon) for accounting and financial
    purposes.
  6: "The methodology involves direct field measurement of NEE (CO\u2082, CH\u2084\
    , and N\u2082O) relative to a zero-emission baseline using an SoS (System of Systems)\
    \ and one or more GMPs (Good Management Practices). It includes ex-ante, annual\
    \ accreditation periods and verification of system performance by third-party\
    \ verifiers, and calibration of GHG analyzers according to SoS operation."
  7: Utilizes eddy covariance method and NEE data from single tower sites to estimate
    carbon flux; involves extrapolating NEE data to larger areas for assessment and
    uses carbon prices to explore revenue scenarios.
  8: NEE data used in this analysis are available online from the Fluxnet (2015) quality-checked
    database (http://fluxnet.fluxdata.org/data/fluxnet2015-dataset/) as annual NEE
    based on the gap-filled VUT_NEE_REF values.
  10: Analysis compares eddy covariance measurements from Ankasa Park Tower, Ghana,
    Africa, and Harvard Forest Tower, Massachusetts, USA.
  11: NEE is measured using instruments (open or closed path CO2 analyzers) and standard
    calibration protocols. The DMFCP (hardware and software system) is used for automated
    data reporting and GHG flux measurement. Results are applicable for the periods
    of observation at the HF (24 years) and AP (4 years) sites.
  14: The analysis focuses on methodologies related to carbon accounting, including
    establishing baselines, determining additionality, using NEE (Net Ecosystem Exchange)
    measurements, and employing third-party validation and verification.  It mentions
    different approaches to baseline determination (zero-emission, shared carbon standards),
    and testing for shifts in emissions.
  15: The paper discusses the use of eddy covariance to determine CO2 fluxes and employing
    instrumentation for any isotope to the method; It also mentions the potential
    of a combined isofluxes similar to aquatic and oceanic with the water
  16: Up-scaling tower measurements to Landowner/All stakeholders; harmonization of
    GHG flux data.
  18: 'Extrapolates measured local NEE to 100,000 acres, multiplied by the annual
    NEE record for each site (Harvard Forest with 24 years of NEE, Ankasa Park with
    4 years). Two hypothetical cases: upfront payment, and upfront payment plus annual
    royalty on sales.'
  19: Uses continuous eddy covariance measurements to determine net ecosystem exchange
    (NEE) for forest carbon, contrasting with estimation-based protocols.
  20: The methodology involves pooling forest carbon projects using near real-time
    NEE data and evaluating them for diversification benefits and risks.
  21: The study proposes a DMFCP (Dynamic Multi-resource Forest Carbon Products) model
    and analyzes its potential financial impact on landowners, with emphasis on revenue
    from mixed forest carbon products incorporating biodiversity features. Cases for
    pre-tax revenue for landowners are used to illustrate the potential impact of
    the DMFCP. Long-term cumulative values are shown in Figs. 4B and 7. The hypothetical
    financial structure is presented.
  22: DMFCP implementation would use remote sensing data to establish reliability
    of data extrapolation from a single tower and to guide the placement of additional
    towers to fill spatial gaps in NEE measurement. A minimum two-tower configuration
    or paired GMP sensor nodes for larger networks, would provide redundancy and cross-checks
    to report SoS NEE combined uncertainty.
  23: The DMFCP process provides upfront and annualized payments with no fee for project
    certification and registration, contrasting traditional protocols that require
    lengthy fee-based certifications.
  24: The page contrasts the DMFCP, which uses real-time wireless reporting and third-party
    validation, with traditional forest carbon protocols that rely on desk reviews
    of unobserved CO2 proxies. The DMFCP also employs ton-year accounting.
  25: The DMFCP (presumably a methodology presented earlier in the paper) can be applied
    to international emission reduction policies, using scientifically accepted methods
    and shared NEE data processing algorithms.
  26: The DMFCP normalizes forest emission reduction determinations for voluntary
    and compliance markets, bridging the gap between methods, project types, and outcomes
    for stakeholders.
  27: The authors Vinh Truong, J. William Munger, and Richard Gyimah analyzed data,
    authored or reviewed drafts of the paper, and approved the final draft.

    isotopes in GHG accounting.  It discusses various project features, including
    permanence and monitoring.

    \ \xB120% variance."
  21: The study acknowledges the importance of long-term CO2 measurement for determining
    variance in annual changes of NEE and for creating corresponding annual forest
    carbon financial products. It is not known if the observed trends in carbon sequestration
    will reverse as a result of climate change and/or anthropogenic activity. The
    study assumes 100% of the products are sold in each case covering the cost of
    the DMFCP.
