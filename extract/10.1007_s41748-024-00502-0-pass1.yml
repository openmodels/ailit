  4: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: 'Drought characteristics (frequency, duration, and intensity) across Africa under
    four SSPs (shared socioeconomic pathway) scenarios: SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0,
    and SSP5-8.5'
  4: 'Future drought patterns under climate change; Four socio-economic pathways:
    SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5'
  11: Projected reductions in precipitation, particularly in the Northern, Saharan,
    and Southern regions of Africa; significant rises in Potential Evapotranspiration
    (PET) across Africa and its subregions; emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5,
    SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5).
  12: Changes in SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) driven
    by different climate change scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5)
    for the periods 2021-2040, 2041-2060, and 2081-2100.
  14: Different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) representing varying levels of
    greenhouse gas emissions (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5).
  15: Climate change, specifically modeled through different Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSPs) including SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios.
  16: Changes in drought frequency driven by different climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6,
    SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) impact various regions of Africa.
  19: Increased dryness in Sub-Saharan and Southern Africa, and potential increased
    evaporation rates and temperatures are drivers of risk.
  21: Projected changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) impacting
    drought conditions. Specifically, some regions will experience increased precipitation
    while others will see significant decreases.
Highlights:
  1: Future droughts are expected to be lower frequency, extended duration, and more
    intense.
  11: "Significant dryness shifts are projected in extreme Northern, Western, Central,\
    \ Eastern, and Southern regions under different scenarios in the near-term (2021\u2013\
    2040); these patterns persist in the mid-term and long-term, particularly under\
    \ SSP5-8.5 in the late twenty-first century; there is a consistent shift from\
    \ lower to higher emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6 to SSP5-8.5) for wetness/dryness\
    \ changes."
  12: Under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 high emissions, the Eastern Africa (EAF) and Southern
    Africa (SAF) spotted the most severe increasing drought; low-medium emissions
    over Africa reveal an increase in dryness concentration around West Africa (WAF),
    Central Africa (CAF), and EAF.
  14: Africa will likely face more severe droughts than the historical period under
    all emission scenarios. Drought severity has increased across all scenarios and
    future time frames over the entire African continent.
  15: Drought conditions are projected to worsen in Africa, with the Northern part
    of Africa and the Sahara region experiencing the most pronounced intensification.
    The chance of extreme droughts in Africa and its sub-regions was shown to be higher
    under the more intense emission scenarios, especially in the late twenty-first
    century.
  16: Drought conditions in Africa are expected to change in the future, with regional
    variations. Western, Central, and Eastern Africa are expected to experience rising
    precipitation trends, while Northern, Sahara, and Southern Africa are expected
    to witness decreasing trends.
  19: The page emphasizes the likelihood of more frequent and severe droughts across
    various African regions.
  21: Long-term drought conditions across Africa and its sub-regions are anticipated
    to become less frequent, yet more prolonged and severe. Prioritizing drought mitigation
    and adaptation strategies is strongly advised due to the likelihood of Africa
    experiencing extreme drought.
Methodology:
  1: "This study employs twenty GCMs from CMIP6 to investigate hydrological drought\
    \ characteristics ... spanning three designated periods: 2021\u20132040 (near-term),\
    \ 2041\u20132060 (mid-term), and 2081\u20132100 (long-term). The (SPEI) at a 12-month\
    \ scale and employs bias correction on the multi-model ensemble mean extracted\
    \ from GCMs of the CMIP6 project via cumulative distribution function (CDF). Mann\u2013\
    Kendall approach was implemented for trend"
  4: Uses simulation from a multi-model ensemble (MME) consisting of 20 climate models
    (CMIP6). The GCMs outputs undergo statistical downscaling and bias correction.
    Examines projected scenarios from 2015 to 2100.
  11: Uses the SPEI index to analyze dryness and wetness; employs the Mann-Kendall
    trend test with a 95% confidence level to detect trends in dryness and wetness;
    uses Sen's Slope calculation. Timeframe analyzed is historical (1979-2014) with
    projections to 2100.
  12: CMIP6-projected trends for SPEI-12 are analyzed for the historical period 1995-2014
    and projections 2015-2100. Sen's Slope is used to test for trends in dryness with
    a 95% confidence level.
  14: The study uses the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPEI) to identify dryness
    or wetness changes. Box-and-whisker plots are used to show the interquartile range,
    median, minimum/maximum values, and outliers for drought duration under different
    SSPs and time periods relative to a historical period. Drought intensity is averaged
    throughout time periods.
  15: GCM-simulated drought frequency measured by the SPEI drought index over Africa
    is used. Analysis is based on multi-model ensemble median projections under different
    SSP scenarios.
  16: The study uses GCMs from CMIP6 to project future drought conditions based on
    the SPEI drought index. The analysis is applicable to understanding drought changes
    in Africa and its sub-regions under different climate scenarios.
  21: The study uses CMIP6 under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 to project
    hydrological drought conditions. It employs CDF matching method (CDFm) to correct
    biases in variables and the model metric E to evaluate model performance with
    respect to variability and bias. The study utilizes gridded observational data
    spanning from 1979 to 2014, adhering to the latest IPCC AR6 guidelines. Future
    CMIP6 simulation (2015 to 2100) was subjected to bias correction.

    \ radiation, wind speed, precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature)\
    \ for the period 1979\u20132014. Reference period: 1995-2014."

Quantitative material:
  1: "severe drought characteristics are manifested as a 6-month duration, 12 occurrences,\
    \ and an intensity of \u2212 1.9 events over Africa"
  11: Mentions the use of the SPEI index (values below -1 indicating dryness and values
    above 1 indicating wetness); near-term (2021-2040), mid-term (2041-2060) and long-term
    (2081-2100) projections under different scenarios.
  12: SPEI values range from -3.5 to 3.5, with color-coding indicating wet (lower
    SPEI) and dry (higher SPEI) conditions.
  14: "Average drought durations (in years) are provided for various African regions\
    \ (Northern Africa, Sahara, Western Africa, Central Africa, Eastern Africa, Southern\
    \ Africa) under different SSPs and time periods (2021\u20132040, 2041\u20132060,\
    \ 2081\u20132100). For example, Northern Africa is projected to have average drought\
    \ durations of 10.1, 11.1, and 12.7 years for the periods 2021\u20132040, 2041\u2013\
    2060, and 2081\u20132100, respectively."
  15: "Projected drought intensities (SPEI) are given for different regions (Northern\
    \ Africa, Sahara, Western Africa, Central Africa, Eastern Africa, and Southern\
    \ Africa) under different SSP scenarios for the periods 2021\u20132040, 2041\u2013\
    2060, and 2081\u20132100. The average drought intensity during the historical\
    \ period was -1.9."
  16: The figure presents quantitative projections of drought frequency for different
    regions of Africa under different SSPs for the periods 2021-2040, 2041-2060, and
    2081-2100, relative to historical data.
  21: "The duration of droughts is projected to increase from 7.3 years (2021\u2013\
    2040) to 16.4 years (2041\u20132060) and 16.6 years (2081\u20132100). Drought\
    \ frequency is expected to decline from 6.4 times (2021-2040) to 3.6 times (2081-2100).\
    \ Drought intensity is projected to escalate from -1.9 historically to -2.6 events\
    \ in the long-term period (2081-2100), with indices as high as -3.0 events under\
    \ SSP5-8.5 in NAF and SAH. Observed SPEI-12 trends across Africa show a downward\
    \ trend of -0.05 per year from 1979 to 2014, with regional variations ranging\
    \ from -0.01 to -0.06 per year."
