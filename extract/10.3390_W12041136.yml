Drivers of Risk:
  1: Droughts and water scarcity; Land and water management decisions that deepen
    vulnerability to droughts; Degradation and desertification
  5: No relevant information
  7: Drought, increasing upstream water extraction leading to reduced water flow downstream,
    catchment-level inequalities in access to water.
  10: Drought, water scarcity, and systemic effects of land and water management decisions
    that deepen vulnerability to droughts.
  16: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: Global economic assessments often still fail to connect to holistic consideration
    of vulnerability at a local scale; National accounting systems fail to recognize
    the contributions that vulnerable communities and individuals make to the formal
    and informal national economies, and the value of ecosystem services.
  5: The three approaches differ in their focus (people, ecosystems, water availability),
    data needs, ability to connect to climate/economic models, and consideration of
    different sectors of the economy.
  7: Drought can cause significant economic losses, including loss of economic growth.
    Upstream water extraction exacerbates downstream drought vulnerability.

Methodology:
  1: Rapid review of experiences from selected nations and of the available literature
    documenting methodological approaches to assess drought impacts and vulnerability
    at the local level
  5: 'The paper summarizes three broad methodological approaches for drought assessment:
    People-centred, Land or ecosystem-based, and Water balanced. It outlines the strengths
    and weaknesses of each approach.'
  7: Impact assessment following the 2008-11 drought identified the value of lost
    production, productive assets, basic services and living conditions.
  16: No relevant information
More Notes:
  1: Simple preventive actions are routinely overlooked, deprioritized, and underfunded.
  5: The table highlights potential limitations of each approach, such as focusing
    on household/field scale, missing strategic water management solutions, or facing
    institutional challenges in data collection and management.
  7: The value of livestock assets was systematically underestimated in national statistical
    data collection systems in 2011.
  16: This page appears to be a list of references. The titles of the references suggest
    a focus on vulnerability and capacity assessment, community-based adaptation,
    and risk reduction in the context of drought, but the page itself does not provide
    any specific quantitative macroeconomic or macro-fiscal analysis.

Quantitative material:
  1: Avoidable costs of drought, degradation and desertification are underestimated
    globally
  5: No relevant information
  7: The 2008-11 drought in Kenya resulted in Ksh 968.6 billion (US$12.1 billion)
    in lost production, productive assets, basic services, and living conditions,
    and a loss of economic growth at 2.8% per year for three years.
