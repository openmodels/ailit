Drivers of Risk:
  1: Human-induced climate change leading to warming and uncertain rainfall patterns;
    heavy dependence on agriculture; high population growth rate
  3: No relevant information
  4: Adverse effects of climate change; Diversity of biophysical and socioeconomic
    conditions across the country; High variability in farming systems and livelihoods.
  6: Climate change
  8: Perceived changes in temperature, precipitation, timing of rains, and frequency
    of extreme events (floods and droughts) by farmers.
  9: Climate change impacts on agricultural production.
  10: Changes in climate, human-induced wind and water erosion, soil degradation,
    land suitability for agriculture.
  12: Variations in agroecosystems (AES) and their impact on agricultural practices.
  13: Climate change related disasters.
  14: Climate change impacts, lack of capable local institutions, lack of active community
    participation, lack of technically skilled manpower at the local level.
  16: Climate variability and change; population growth; inappropriate traditional
    farming and management practices; extensive cultivation; overgrazing; deforestation;
    soil erosion; soil fertility decline; water scarcity; livestock feed shortages;
    fuel wood needs; extreme weather events; uncertainty in climate forecasts (precipitation
    amount, timing, intensity); uncertainty regarding future socio-economic states.
  18: Natural resource pressure from population growth, inappropriate farming practices,
    climate change, and socio-economic diversity.
Highlights:
  1: Ethiopia is particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of climate change
    due to its low level of economic development, heavy dependence on agriculture,
    and high population growth rate. The Blue Nile Highlands are especially important.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Single, national-level agriculture adaptation strategies cannot work in a biophysically
    or socially diverse country; Community by ecosystem-based approach has significant
    potential for building climate resilience.
  8: Farmers perceive increases in temperature and changes in precipitation patterns,
    leading to adjustments in cropping calendars and other practices.
  9: Farmers are adopting a variety of measures to adapt to climate change, with reducing
    social spending and storing grain being the most common. Adaptive capacity indicators
    are related to human, social, physical, natural and financial capital.
  10: Vulnerability is hypothesized to increase with crop suitability. AES 1 and AES
    5 have the highest degradation rates; AES 3 is the most suitable land for agriculture.
  12: Adoption of improved seeds varies significantly across agroecosystems; certain
    agroecosystems show a much higher adoption rate than others.
  13: Farmers' use of improved soil conservation practices varies significantly with
    AEZs.
  14: Farmer participation in adaptation efforts is generally low, particularly in
    implementation and monitoring and evaluation phases. Training, extension worker
    visits, perception of benefits, and perception of responsibility are positively
    correlated with farmer participation. Community-based projects can increase community
    participation in natural resource governance.
  16: Sustainability of projects that take the natural resource base as an entry point
    is questionable, interventions fail to establish the link to markets required
    for sustainability after project close.
  18: The paper emphasizes the need for flexible adaptation strategies and guidelines
    to understand and measure vulnerability in agriculture.
Methodology:
  1: A five-year study of climate vulnerability and adaptation strategies in communities
    of Choke Mountain informed a proposed framework for enhancing climate resilience.
  3: No relevant information
  4: A community by ecosystem-based approach for building climate resilience; Classification
    and analysis of major agro-ecosystems on the basis of ecology, soil, and farming
    systems.
  6: Analysis and classification of Agro-ecosystems/Farming Systems in the Choke Mountain
    Watersheds was undertaken to support agricultural policy makers and development
    experts... The classification provides a lens for adaptation analysis that takes
    into account the geographical differentiation (climate, topography, soils, farming
    systems) as well as the socio-economic stratification of the agricultural sector
    of the study area.
  8: Analysis of farmer perceptions across agro-ecological systems in Choke Mountain.
  9: ANOVA test on adaptation measures by agro-ecosystem (AES). Regression analysis
    identifies 13 indicators of adaptive capacity using socio-economic, climatic,
    and soil data across five AESs. Livelihood assets are a proxy for adaptive capacity.
  10: The study uses FAO data on human-induced land degradation, combined with a classification
    of agroecosystems based on constraints like soil depth, fertility, and drainage.
    Suitability is evaluated on a scale of 1 to 5.
  13: Analysis uses ANOVA test to assess the significance of differences in soil conservation
    practices among different agroecological zones (AEZs).
  14: "Participation index analysis of farmers\u2019 participation level in watershed\
    \ management activities; Regression analysis to determine the relationship between\
    \ farmer participation and training, frequency of visits by extension workers,\
    \ farmers\u2019 perception, and responsibility for watershed resource conservation."
  16: Community-Based Adaptation (CBA) development projects implemented in Choke Mountain
    watersheds, focusing on empowering vulnerable people and preserving the natural
    resource base through participatory analysis of biophysical vulnerability.
  18: Studies based on community-level adaptation analysis and interventions tailored
    to local conditions with workshops for input.
More Notes:
  3: The page primarily focuses on resilience and adaptive capacity at a community
    level in the Abay Highlands of Ethiopia, and introduces a community-based ecosystem
    approach and a new local institution (Community-based Innovation Platform) to
    enhance adaptation strategies. It only contains one line from another study containing
    macroeconomic information.
  6: The paper focuses on a community-based, ecosystem approach to building resilience,
    using the Choke Mountain experience as a case study.
  8: The study focuses on a specific region (Choke Mountain) and agricultural practices,
    so the findings might not be directly generalizable to national-level macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal outcomes without further analysis.
  9: The study focuses on the Choke Mountain watersheds in Ethiopia.
  10: The analysis focuses on the Choke Mountain watersheds. The paper relates specific
    agroecosystem characteristics to vulnerability based on land suitability and degradation.
  12: The paper focuses on adoption rates of agricultural practices rather than direct
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. The information presented serves more as an
    indication of adaptive capacity and potential vulnerabilities within different
    agricultural regions. While no direct costs/benefits are reported, the adoption
    of practices can be seen as a proxy for adaptation strategy effectiveness.
  13: The study investigates adaptive capacity in the Choke Mountain watersheds, considering
    financial, human, and social capital. Adaptive capacity indices are compared across
    agroecosystems.
  14: The paper argues for a broad definition of adaptation technologies, including
    both hard technologies (e.g., irrigation) and soft technologies (e.g., crop rotation,
    organizational capacity).
  16: Suggests markets are a more appropriate entry point for adaptation strategies
    than natural resource preservation alone.

    \ each year (referenced from a World Bank study)."
  8: 74.4% of sample households surveyed in the Choke Mountain study report that they
    have taken adjustment measures against climate change. In the cold sub-moist mid-highlands
    (AES 5) 90% of sample households have adjusted their cropping with the change
    in rainfall patterns. In the temperate moist mid-highlands (AES 3) only 58.3%
    of households have adjusted.

    grain (84%), reducing food consumption (72%), selling livestock (44%), inter-household
    transfers (40%), selling forest products (19%), wage labor (8%), credit (4%),
    migration (3%), sale of assets (2%). AES adaptation percentages (Table 1)'
  10: Agroecosystems suitability is rated on a scale from 1 to 5; Land degradation
    is measured on a scale from 0 to 6 for each agroecosystem.
