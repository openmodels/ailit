Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global climate change
  3: Climate change impacts such as increased frequency of extreme weather events
    (e.g., heat waves, floods), demand-side drivers like population growth, urbanization,
    and shifts in consumption patterns, and competition for resources like water,
    energy, and land.
  4: Food system activities produce greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other climate change
    forcings (e.g., aerosols, changes in albedo). Specific drivers within the food
    system include fertilizer manufacture, energy use in animal feed production, pesticide
    production, direct and indirect emissions from agriculture, primary and secondary
    processing, storage, packaging, transport, refrigeration, retail activities, catering
    and domestic food management, and waste disposal.
  7: Increased ambient temperatures leading to increased refrigeration use and associated
    GHG emissions.
  12: Extreme weather events affecting food harvest, storage, transportation, marketing,
    and consumption, with focus on wet and hot spells, floods, and climate variability.
  13: Climate change impacts on agriculture (reduced consumption, reduced income generation,
    reduced adaptive capacity), climate variability, extreme weather events, climate
    shocks, long-term trends.
  14: Increasing climate variability leads to sensitivity to sudden decreases in food
    quality, safety, and availability at the local level; weak access to public services
    and humanitarian assistance; isolation from market signals; greater integration
    of poor farmers into global markets can raise poverty rates; rising food prices
    since 2007 and associated social unrest.

Highlights:
  1: The impacts of global climate change on food systems are expected to be widespread,
    complex, geographically and temporally variable, and profoundly influenced by
    socioeconomic conditions. Low-income producers and consumers of food will be more
    vulnerable to climate change owing to their comparatively limited ability to invest
    in adaptive institutions and technologies under increasing climatic risks.
  3: Food systems are in flux due to various demand and supply-side drivers and are
    unable to prevent widespread chronic malnutrition despite adequate markets.
  4: Food systems are a major contributor to climate change. Agricultural production
    is the largest contributor within the food system.
  7: The cold chain accounts for approximately 1% of total global GHG emissions or
    about 490 MtCO2e.
  12: Extreme weather leads to significant challenges in food supply chains, potentially
    threatening food security and health due to increased mycotoxins, and can disrupt
    high-income and low-income country markets differently.
  13: Climate change will slow, but not reverse, the rate of poverty reduction globally;
    the impacts of climate change fall disproportionately on the poor, thereby increasing
    inequality over time; vulnerability to climate change is not evenly distributed.
  14: Climate change is expected to significantly increase child malnutrition, especially
    in Africa and Asia; rising food prices and social unrest demonstrate the gravity
    of future challenges of climate change to food availability and access.

Methodology:
  1: Historical statistical studies and integrated assessment models
  4: Estimates are based on data from various sources (referenced). Postproduction
    figures are largely multiplied up from Chinese data on the assumption that it
    is suitably representative of the global level.
  7: The paper does not present new research, but rather brings together existing
    data to estimate the cold chain's contribution to total global GHG emissions.
  13: Review of integrated modeling studies.

More Notes:
  3: The paper emphasizes the importance of government intervention in markets to
    ensure affordable and stable food prices and highlights the significance of poverty
    reduction for achieving food security.
  7: The paper discusses the energy consumption of various stages of the food chain,
    including processing, packaging, transportation, refrigeration, retail activities,
    catering, and domestic food management.
  22: This page primarily poses research questions related to food security and climate
    change adaptation, without presenting specific results or analysis related to
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level. The questions focus
    on improving integrated assessment models, options for mitigation and adaptation
    in the food system, and policy mechanisms for reducing the burden of climate change
    on poor producers and consumers.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Agricultural yields and earnings, food prices, reliability of delivery, food
    quality, and food safety.
  7: No relevant information
  13: Poverty reduction rate, inequality, food security (availability, access, utilization,
    stability), farm incomes.
  14: Rising food prices disproportionately affect poor people; climate change impacts
    on rural farming communities are of major concern, but impacts on affordability
    are paramount for urban populations; climate change will result in a 20% increase
    in child malnutrition by 2050, particularly in Africa and Asia.

Quantitative material:
  1: "Food systems contribute 19%\u201329% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas\
    \ (GHG) emissions, releasing 9,800\u201316,900 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent\
    \ (MtCO2e) in 2008."
  4: 'The food system contributes 19%-29% of total global anthropogenic GHG emissions.
    Agricultural production contributes 80%-86% of this at the global level. Specific
    estimates for different stages of the food chain are provided in Table 1 (e.g.,
    Fertilizer manufacture: 282-575 MtCO2e, Direct emissions from agriculture: 5,120-6,116
    MtCO2e).'
