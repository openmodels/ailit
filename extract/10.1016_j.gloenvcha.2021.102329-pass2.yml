Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change-induced natural disasters, income inequality
  4: Climate-related disasters and other climate-sensitive geographical features
  5: "Natural disasters (wet and dry typologies); Repeated exposure to extreme events\
    \ in previous years; Oceanic Ni\xF1o Index (El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a conditions);\
    \ Ethnic inequality."
  6: "Natural disasters (frequency and stock of disasters, specifically dry and wet\
    \ disasters), El Ni\u02DCno, La Ni\u02DCna"
  7: Natural disasters (number and type - dry vs. wet), climate (El Nino, La Nina),
    socioeconomic factors (GDP per capita, HDI), public budget composition, country
    profile (land cover, rural population, surface area), social norms (quality of
    institutions, marginalization of ethnic groups), geographical factors (continental
    dummies)
  8: Number of people affected by natural disasters (HIT), GDP per capita, Human Development
    Index (HDI), Public expenditure, Institutional quality, Ethnic marginalization
  9: "Gini coefficient (current and lagged), GDP per capita (lagged), GNHDI (lagged)\
    \ and its square, Public expenditure (lagged), Public investment (lagged), Number\
    \ of disasters (current and lagged), Stock of disasters (lagged), Interaction\
    \ GDP-Dis (lagged), Land Area, Rural Population, El Ni\xF1o, La Ni\xF1a."
  10: All disasters, dry disasters, wet disasters, GDP per capita, Human Development
    Index (HDI), public expenditure, institutional quality, ethnic marginalization.
  11: Recurrent climate-related disasters; Inequality (Gini index); Climatological,
    environmental, and socioeconomic factors; Rapidly changing climate conditions;
    Stock of wet disasters.
Highlights:
  1: Countries with higher levels of income inequality suffer greater damages when
    hit by a natural disaster. Inequality increases the number of people affected
    by disasters. A vicious cycle exists that keeps some countries stuck in a disasters-inequality
    trap.
  4: Floods are the most frequent disaster; Latin America and the Caribbean, and Asia
    have a higher occurrence of natural disasters compared to other regions; Floods
    have affected over 3 billion people.
  6: The paper investigates the relationship between socioeconomic resilience, disaster
    frequency, geographical controls, and inequality with physical damages from natural
    disasters.
  7: Gini index has a positive and highly significant coefficient in the disaster
    equation. The effects of inequality and disasters are robust in all model specifications.
  8: An increase in inequality is a positive predictor of the number of people affected
    by natural disasters. The number of people affected by disasters entails a substantial
    rise of inequality.
  9: "La Ni\xF1a has a positive effect on the number of people hit by wet disasters.\
    \ Countries with higher shares of rural population are more exposed to high impacts\
    \ on human activities. Public expenditure has a negative effect on inequality."
  10: "The effect of wet disasters on income inequality is higher than that of dry\
    \ disasters. Countries under strain from repeated floods and storms struggle to\
    \ escape the vulnerability-disaster trap. Marginalisation in ethnic groups affects\
    \ income distribution in the event of frequent and repeated wet disasters. Richer\
    \ economies are more resilient in the face of damages relative to poorer countries.\
    \ The negative interaction term between income level and cumulative frequency\
    \ of disasters confirms that in the face of similar exposure to disasters, the\
    \ relative extent of the damage is inversely correlated with the country\u2019\
    s level of wealth. Persistency in the vulnerability-disaster trap is observed."
  11: Countries with higher levels of inequality that have been affected more frequently
    by extreme climatic events may be trapped in a vicious cycle, undermining resilience.
    The study calls for a broader understanding of natural disasters as the combination
    of climatic and socioeconomic factors.
Methodology:
  1: Simultaneous equations approach on a panel of 149 countries from 1992 to 2018.
  4: Uses regression analysis to assess the impact of climate-related disasters, controlling
    for socioeconomic variables, climate-sensitive geographical features, and country-based
    factors. Includes proxies for social norms to analyze the regression on inequality.
    Incorporates the 'adaptation deficit' framework, considering both demand (willingness
    to pay) and supply (quality of services, capital investments) factors influencing
    adaptation.
  5: Uses a system of simultaneous equations and a Three-Stage Least Square (3SLS)
    estimator to analyze the mutual effects of damages due to natural disasters and
    income inequality. The model also considers GDP per capita and the HDI in all
    different forms and all measures of adaptation supply (public expenditures, investments
    and infrastructures) as endogenous.
  6: The paper uses panel data analysis with country fixed effects and instrumental
    variables to address endogeneity concerns. The models are estimated for a panel
    of countries over time. They propose to use Sargan test to test the explanatory
    variables potentially affected by endogeneity.
  7: System of equations (equations 2 and 3) estimated using panel data. Includes
    country and year fixed effects, continental dummies, and controls for El Nino
    and La Nina. Instrumental variable approach using distance from the Equator. Multicollinearity
    tested with Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). Model selection based on Akaike Information
    Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
  8: Panel data regression analysis is used to test the relationship between inequality
    (Gini index) and various factors, including the number of people affected by natural
    disasters. The analysis controls for various factors and explores linear and non-linear
    relationships.
  9: Regression analysis using panel data, controlling for continent and year dummies
    (in some specifications). Chi-squared statistic and RMSE are reported as measures
    of fit. Mean VIF is also reported.
  10: Panel data regression analysis. The dependent variable is the Gini index. Independent
    variables include disaster-related variables (HIT, D_HIT, W_HIT, Stock Disasters),
    GDP per capita, HDI, public expenditure, institutional quality, and ethnic marginalization.
    The analysis distinguishes between all disasters, dry disasters, and wet disasters.
    Marginal effects based on partial derivatives are computed. System of equations
    with lagged dependent variables are estimated.
  11: Empirical analysis of natural disasters between 1992 and 2018. The analysis
    explores complex associations in relation to natural disasters.
More Notes:
  1: The paper aims to disentangle the mechanisms connecting climate change-induced
    disasters, inequality, and vulnerability, accounting for both directions of causality.
  4: Uses GDP per capita and the Human Development Index (HDI) to proxy willingness
    to pay for a safer environment. Controls for gender disparity as an element of
    vulnerability to disasters. Explanatory variables are grouped into socioeconomic
    conditions, disaster magnitude, frequency of climate-related disasters, and inequality
    proxies.
  5: The analysis controls for government final consumption expenditure and net investment
    in nonfinancial assets as proxies for resilience and adaptation capacity, frequency
    of current events and the cumulative number of past disasters, continent dummies,
    surface area covered by administrative boundaries, the share of population based
    in rural areas, and institutional quality.
  6: The paper uses distance from the Equator and value added in agriculture as instruments
    for GDP per capita and public budget composition, respectively, to address endogeneity
    concerns.
  7: The paper splits disasters into dry and wet types to analyze their potentially
    divergent impacts (D_HIT and W_HIT). It also uses different ways to control for
    the impact associated with the number of disasters experienced by country i in
    year t or in past years.
  8: The study finds a non-linear, inverted U-shaped relationship between the development
    level (GNHDI - Gender-corrected Human Development Index) and the magnitude of
    impacts from disasters, suggesting that countries with a higher level of human
    capabilities and gender equality are less affected by disasters. Public expenditure
    on GDP is positively associated with the number of people affected by disasters,
    potentially due to the composition of public spending and rent-seeking behaviour.
  10: The paper explores the relationship between disasters, inequality, and resilience,
    focusing on wet and dry disaster types. The analysis considers climatic, geographical,
    and socio-economic factors. The study attempts to determine how a disaster exposure
    creates feedback loops with inequality. Some results appear to be sensitive to
    the type of disaster and the level of inequality in the country. The number of
    observations is 3419.
  11: The analysis suggests that adaptation mechanisms should keep pace with rapidly
    changing climate and that equitable access to precautionary and recovery measures
    is important.

  6: The paper provides descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max)
    for various variables, including disaster frequencies, GDP per capita, public
    expenditure, and public investment.
  7: Table 2a presents regression results with the number of people hit by natural
    disasters as the dependent variable. Coefficients for Gini index, GDP per capita,
    various HDI measures, public expenditure, public investment, number of disasters,
    land area, and rural population are reported. Chi2, RMSE, and Mean VIF are also
    provided.

    and various independent variables, including HIT, GDP per capita, NHDI, HDI, Public
    exp., Inst. quality, and Ethnic marg. Coefficients, standard errors, significance
    levels (p < 0.1, p < 0.05, p < 0.01), Chi2, RMSE, Mean VIF, No. Observations,
    AIC and BIC are reported. Additionally, "a 1% increase in the Gini index in a
    country at the 75th percentile corresponds to 3.7% more people hit by natural
    disasters than in a country at the 25th percentile."
  9: Table 3a presents coefficients, standard errors, and significance levels (p <
    0.1, p < 0.05, p < 0.01) for the effects of various drivers on the number of persons
    hit by disasters, broken down by disaster type (All, Dry, Wet).
  10: Table 3b presents regression results with coefficients, standard errors, and
    significance levels for various climatic and geographical controls on the Gini
    index. Marginal effects of the stock of past wet disasters on the number of people
    hit are reported for Gini index quartiles. Interaction term between income level
    and cumulative frequency of disasters is negative and statistically significant.
  11: The figure shows the predicted margins for W_HIT (likely a proxy for impact
    of wet disasters) with respect to the stock of wet disasters for different inequality
    levels (Gini index quartiles). The X-axis is 'Stock of wet disasters t-1' ranging
    from approximately 2 to 540, and the Y-axis is 'No. of killed people by 'wet'
    disasters (mean/median)'. The graphs show a positive correlation between the stock
    of wet disasters and the number of killed people across all quartiles of the Gini
    index.
