Drivers of Risk:
  2: Flooding, landslides, windstorms, natural disasters.
  5: "Frequency of wet and dry disasters, cumulative effect of repeated exposure to\
    \ extreme events in previous years, Oceanic Ni\xF1o Index (ONI) which triggers\
    \ extreme climatic events."
  6: "The shocks impacting outcomes are 'No. disasters', 'No. dry disasters', 'No.\
    \ wet disasters', 'Stock disasters', 'Stock dry disasters', 'Stock wet disasters',\
    \ El Ni\u02DCno, and La Ni\u02DCna."
  7: "The paper investigates the impact of El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a, number of disasters,\
    \ socioeconomic variables (GDP per capita, HDI), public budget composition, land\
    \ cover, rural population, and continental location on disaster risk."
  8: The number of people affected by natural disasters (HIT) is used as a driver
    of inequality.
  9: "El Ni\u02DCno (no significant effect), La Ni\u02DCna (positive effect, especially\
    \ for wet disasters), Number of Disasters, Stock of Disasters, Land Area, Rural\
    \ Population"
  11: Recurrent climate-related disasters (specifically floods, storms, and droughts)
    are identified as drivers that can undermine a country's ability to recover and
    prepare for future events, exacerbating vulnerability.
Evaluation overview:
  2: Economic development and disaster risk associated with flooding, landslides and
    windstorms; mortality and asset loss from natural disasters.
  5: Damages due to natural disasters
  6: The paper evaluates the impact of disasters (measured by death toll and number
    of people affected, normalized by population) on various outcomes.
  7: The paper evaluates the impact of natural disasters (measured as the number of
    people hit by disasters normalized by population) and inequality (measured by
    the Gini index).
  8: This paper evaluates the impact of inequality (measured by the Gini index) and
    other factors on the number of people affected by natural disasters.
  9: Number of persons hit (normalised) by different types of disasters.
  10: The paper evaluates the impact of different types of disasters (all, dry, wet)
    on income inequality (Gini index).
  11: The paper studies climate change-induced disasters and their impact on countries,
    populations, and income groups, with a focus on mortality (number of people killed
    by wet disasters).
Highlights:
  2: The impact of natural disasters is uneven across segments of the population within
    a country. Economies in recession suffer less the impact of natural disasters,
    which can instead act as a positive stimulus. Strain in the aftermath of a disaster
    is often fertile ground for collateral effects such as the breakout of armed conflicts,
    unrest among the civilian population as well as mass outmigration.
  5: Damages due to natural disasters will be, ceteris paribus, harsher in unequal
    societies relative to more equal ones. Further, damages due to a natural disaster
    lead, everything else being equal, to increasing inequality.
  7: Gini index consistently has a positive and highly significant coefficient in
    the disaster equation, suggesting that higher inequality is associated with greater
    disaster impact (more people hit).
  8: Inequality causes a relative increase in impacts and damages provoked by disasters.
    An increase in the number of people affected by disasters entails a rise of inequality.
    Public expenditure is positively associated with a higher number of persons affected
    by damages, while investment expenditures in nonfinancial assets are significantly
    and negatively related to the magnitude of impacts.
  9: "La Ni\u02DCna has a positive effect on the number of people hit by wet disasters.\
    \ Countries with higher shares of rural population are more exposed to high impacts\
    \ on human activities."
  10: A higher number of people affected by wet disasters has a much higher impact
    on income inequality than dry disasters. Marginalisation in ethnic groups affects
    income distribution in the event of frequent and repeated wet disasters. Richer
    economies are more resilient to disasters given similar frequency and magnitude.
  11: Countries with higher levels of inequality are more vulnerable to the impacts
    of extreme climatic events, potentially leading to a vicious cycle where disasters
    exacerbate existing inequalities and hinder recovery. The relationship between
    the stock of wet disasters and the number of people killed by wet disasters is
    stronger in areas with higher Gini Indices.
Methodology:
  2: The study considers how inequality as a factor for vulnerability. It argues that
    extreme events are understood as human-related rather than merely natural phenomena.
  5: Uses a Three-Stage Least Square (3SLS) estimator to estimate the mutual effects
    of natural disasters and inequality. System must meet the identification condition,
    according to which the number of excluded exogenous variables is greater than
    or equal to the number of included endogenous variables
  6: The authors use statistical analysis and regression models to test hypotheses
    about the relationship between disaster impacts, socioeconomic resilience, and
    inequality, using panel data (4023 observations) and addressing endogeneity concerns
    with instrumental variables.
  7: The study uses a system of equations to model the relationship between disaster
    risk, inequality, and various socioeconomic and climatic factors. They use instrumental
    variables to deal with endogeneity, control for geographical and climatic fixed
    effects, and test for multicollinearity using VIF. The analysis appears to be
    based on panel data.
  8: The analysis uses panel data and regression models to assess the relationship
    between inequality, human development, public expenditure, institutional quality,
    ethnic marginalization, and the number of people affected by natural disasters.
    Models include lagged variables and controls for various factors. Significance
    levels are indicated (* p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01).
  9: Regression analysis with controls for climatic, geographical, and socio-economic
    factors. Models are estimated for 'All Disasters', 'Dry Disasters', and 'Wet Disasters'.
    Dynamic effects are included by lagging variables. Continent and year dummies
    are included in some models.
  10: The analysis uses regression models to examine the relationship between climatic/geographical
    factors and income inequality.  The models are applied to panel data with lagged
    variables (e.g., GDP per capita i,t-1). The effects of inequality on the number
    of people affected is higher in wet disasters relative to dry disasters.
  11: The study empirically explores the associations between natural disasters and
    socioeconomic factors using data from 1992 to 2018. The analysis examines how
    the relationship between disaster stock and fatalities varies across different
    levels of income inequality (Gini index quartiles).
More Notes:
  5: Considers GDP per capita, the HDI in all different forms and all measures of
    adaptation supply (public expenditures, investments and infrastructures) as endogenous
    variables.
  6: The authors address endogeneity issues by using distance from the equator and
    the share of value added in agriculture as instruments. They also use country
    fixed effects as instruments.
  7: The paper differentiates between 'dry' and 'wet' disasters and examines their
    separate impacts. They control for time-invariant country effects, geographical
    effects, and continental dummies.
  9: The dependent variable is the number of persons hit, normalised. The table also
    includes interaction terms like 'Interaction GDP-Dis i,t-1'
  10: The paper uses interaction terms (e.g., between income level and cumulative
    frequency of disasters) to test for non-linearities.  It also considers the cumulative
    effect of past disasters (Stock Disasters).
  11: The paper emphasizes the importance of considering both climatic and socioeconomic
    factors when modeling climate change impacts and developing adaptation policies.
    It argues that adaptation mechanisms should consider floods, storms, and droughts
    as natural events, not disasters, by ensuring equitable access to precautionary
    and recovery measures.
Quantitative material:
  5: Uses government final consumption expenditure (as % of GDP) as a proxy of ordinary
    management efforts, and net investment in nonfinancial assets (as % of GDP) as
    a proxy of the attitude of the public sector to maintain and expand physical infrastructures.
  6: The paper provides descriptive statistics (Mean, Std. Dev., Min, Max) for various
    variables related to disaster impacts (HIT, D_HIT, W_HIT) and socioeconomic factors.
  7: Table 2a presents regression results showing the impact of the Gini index, GDP
    per capita, various HDI computations, public expenditure, number of disasters,
    land area, and rural population on the number of people hit by natural disasters.
  8: A 1% increase in the Gini index in a country at the 75th percentile corresponds
    to 3.7% more people hit by natural disasters than in a country at the 25th percentile.
    The coefficient of HIT in the inequality equation ranges between 68.5 and 95.3,
    with an interquartile range on average of 17.5%.
  9: 'Table provides regression coefficients and standard errors for various factors
    influencing the number of persons hit by disasters, normalized. Significance levels
    are indicated by asterisks: * p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01'
  10: The table provides regression coefficients (with standard errors in parentheses)
    for various factors influencing the Gini index.  For example, in model (6), a
    one-unit increase in W_HIT (number of people hit by wet disasters) is associated
    with a 140.515 increase in the Gini index, and this result is statistically significant
    at p < 0.01. Also RMSE, AIC and BIC are provided.
  11: The analysis presents scatter plots showing the relationship between the stock
    of wet disasters and the number of people killed by wet disasters across different
    inequality (Gini index) quartiles, suggesting a positive correlation. The slopes
    of the lines within the scatter plots quantify the relationship between wet disasters
    and number of deaths.
