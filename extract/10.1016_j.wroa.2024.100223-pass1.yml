Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change driven water scarcity, varying levels of investment foresight.
  2: Water scarcity events.
  3: Temporal water scarcity events leading to economic shocks.
  4: Water scarcity events, specifically drought conditions impacting sectors directly
    dependent on water.
  5: Temporal water scarcity events.
  6: Month-long water scarcity events in May and August, with varying severity (30%
    and 35% reduction in water efficiency, respectively).
  7: Temporal water scarcity events are the primary drivers of risk examined.
  8: Temporal water scarcity event.
  9: Temporal water scarcity event impacting freshwater availability.
Highlights:
  1: Firms' foresight (or lack thereof) impacts their response to water scarcity and
    subsequent impact on the economy. Certain sectors can benefit from competitiveness
    effects mitigating adverse impacts, but may lead to catch-up effect on water use.
    Promotion of anticipation and preparedness among firms and prioritizing resilience-building
    measures are crucial.
  2: Different investment behaviors in response to water scarcity significantly impact
    macroeconomic outcomes like GDP and employment. Firms with myopic expectations
    experience a GDP decrease and employment decline during water scarcity.
  3: Scenario 2 shows more severe economic impacts with a 0.89% drop in GDP and slower
    recovery in GDP compared to Scenario 1.
  4: The presence of foresight in investment decisions enhances economic resilience,
    allowing for rapid recovery post-water scarcity events; firms with perfect foresight
    minimize GDP and employment declines.
  5: Positive GDP and employment impacts under various industrial sectors; water use
    impacts vary significantly.
  6: The study analyzes the impact of water scarcity on the economy using different
    investment behavior assumptions.
  7: Increased economic openness (higher Armington elasticity) tends to have a positive
    effect on GDP and water usage but a negative impact on employment. Firms with
    perfect foresight perform better than those with myopic or imperfect foresight
    during water scarcity events. Imperfect foresight leads to over-investment and
    the most significant negative impacts.
  8: Agriculture, forestry & fishing sector experiences the largest negative impacts
    on GDP, employment, and water use due to water scarcity. Results differ under
    different investment behaviour specifications.
  9: Agriculture is the most heavily affected sector in terms of GDP, employment,
    and water use. Chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing, and electricity generation
    are also significantly negatively impacted. Food and beverage industries are also
    affected due to reliance on agricultural inputs.
Methodology:
  1: Utilizes a custom-built dynamic multisectoral model incorporating behavioural
    and resilience aspects. Focuses on the effects of varying levels of investment
    foresight on economic resilience.
  2: Uses a general equilibrium (CGE) model called DEMACRO-ESS, focused on Germany
    but with qualitative findings relevant to other European nations. The model examines
    different investment behavior specifications (perfect foresight, myopic expectations,
    and imperfect foresight) in response to water scarcity.
  3: Use of DEMACRO-ESS simulation model with different investment behavior specifications
    (Myopic, Imperfect foresight, Perfect foresight).
  4: Analysis performed using a dynamic multi-sectoral CGE model (DEMACRO-ESS) incorporating
    foresight and resilience via investment closures, based on a 2020 Social Accounting
    Matrix for Germany.
  5: Use of DEMACRO-ESS simulation model with multi-level production functions incorporating
    CES production structure for analysis.
  6: 'A computable general equilibrium (CGE) model (AMOS framework) is used with different
    investment behavior closures: perfect foresight, myopic, and imperfect foresight.
    Scenarios are incorporated by reducing the water efficiency parameter in the model.
    The model includes a bargained real wage function incorporating involuntary unemployment
    and labor mobility across sectors. Labour force is fixed.'
  7: The analysis uses the DEMARCO-ESS model and sensitivity analysis on the Armington
    trade elasticity. The results are applicable to simulations of water scarcity
    events.
  8: DEMACRO-ESS simulation is used to model the sectoral effects of a water scarcity
    event under different assumptions about investment behaviour (Myopic, Imperfect
    Foresight, and Perfect Foresight).
  9: DEMACRO-ESS simulation model is used to analyze the sectoral effects of water
    scarcity under different investment behavior scenarios.
More Notes:
  1: "The paper focuses on resilience in relation to the economy\u2019s capacity to\
    \ recover after a disturbance. The analysis considers often overlooked factors\
    \ such as behavioural and resilience aspects."
  3: Scenario 2 involves successive shocks with firms failing to anticipate these
    events correctly.
  4: The study emphasizes the importance of foresight and preparedness in mitigating
    the impact of water scarcity on economic performance, with a specific focus on
    sectoral effects, notably in agriculture, food, and electricity sectors.
  6: The paper utilizes a bargained real wage (BRW) function which is a wage curve
    that allows for involuntary unemployment, to reflect behavioural aspects within
    the aggregate labour market. The modelling framework is capable of conducting
    a thorough analysis of migration and its impacts, though this paper does not consider
    the effects of migration.
  7: "The analysis assumes business-as-usual conditions in Germany\u2019s trade partners,\
    \ which may not be valid if those partners also experience water scarcity. A multi-regional\
    \ framework would be needed to analyze this aspect more thoroughly."
  8: The table presents cumulative percentage changes; therefore, it captures the
    total impact over the entire simulation period rather than just a single year.
    'MY' refers to 'Myopic' investment behavior, 'IM' refers to 'Imperfect Foresight'
    investment behavior, and 'PE' refers to 'Perfect Foresight' investment behavior.
  9: Some sectors like electrical manufacturing and vehicle manufacturing may experience
    positive impacts due to changes in consumer spending patterns and competitiveness,
    but these are outweighed by the negative impacts on agriculture and food manufacturing.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Socio-economic impacts at a macro-level, sector-specific impacts (e.g., agriculture,
    food, electricity production and distribution), and competitiveness effects.
  2: Macroeconomic outcomes like GDP and employment.
  4: Reduction in GDP and employment during drought periods, with varied resilience
    depending on investment foresight capabilities, specifically in water-dependent
    sectors such as agriculture, food, and electricity production.

    1.04%, and water use by 1.39% in Scenario 2.
