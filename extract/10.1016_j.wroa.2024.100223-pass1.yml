Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change driven water scarcity, insufficient rainfall, drought, high consumption
    of water relative to its availability.
  2: Temporary water scarcity events, specifically a single month-long event in May
    and a scenario with continuous water scarcity in May and August.
  3: Temporal water scarcity events are identified as shocks impacting GDP, investment,
    employment, and water use.
  4: Varying levels of investment foresight in response to water scarcity events,
    drought conditions.
  5: Temporal water scarcity events.
  6: Water scarcity events in May and August impact the economic resilience.
  7: Temporal water scarcity events
  8: The primary driver of risk is a temporal water scarcity event affecting various
    economic sectors.
  9: Temporal water scarcity event.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Socio-economic impacts of temporary water scarcity.
  2: Macro-level socio-economic impacts of water scarcity, specifically GDP, investment,
    employment, and water use.
  3: The analysis provides an overview of the impacts on GDP, investment, employment,
    and water use during temporal water scarcity events.
  4: Economic resilience to water scarcity, GDP, employment, and water use across
    sectors.
  5: Impact of different investment behavior models on sector effects of GDP, investment,
    and water use during temporal water scarcity events.
  7: Impacts on GDP, employment, and water use during temporal water scarcity events.
  8: The paper provides an overview of sector effects on GDP, employment, and water
    use during a temporal water scarcity event.
  9: Impacts on GDP, employment, and water use across 25 industrial sectors.
Highlights:
  1: "Firms\u2019 foresight impacts their response to water scarcity and the subsequent\
    \ impact on the economy; certain sectors can benefit from competitiveness effects,\
    \ which can mitigate the adverse economic implications of water scarcity; promotion\
    \ of anticipation and preparedness among firms and resilience-building measures\
    \ in all sectors is crucial."
  2: Different investment behaviors impact the macro-economy during and after periods
    of temporary water scarcity, highlighting the significance of proactive measures.
  3: Scenario one results in a 0.38% fall in GDP, a 0.37% fall in employment, a 0.45%
    fall in investment, and a 0.6% reduction in water use; Scenario two results in
    a 0.89% fall in GDP, a 0.86% fall in employment, a 1.04% fall in investment, and
    a 1.39% reduction in water use.
  4: Firms with foresight perform better during water scarcity events. Agriculture,
    food, and electricity sectors are negatively impacted by water scarcity. Motor
    vehicle sector may benefit from competitiveness effects, but this can increase
    water use. Policies should promote anticipation and preparedness among firms,
    regardless of direct water reliance.
  5: Heatmap shows sector-specific effects of different investment behaviors (Myopic,
    Imperfect foresight, Perfect foresight) on GDP, investment, and water use during
    water scarcity; agriculture, forestry & fishing, food, drink, paper & printing,
    and chemical & pharmaceutical products sectors show significant impacts.
  7: An economy that is more open tends to have a positive effect on GDP and water
    usage, but a negative impact on employment during water scarcity events.  Firms
    with perfect foresight perform better than myopic and imperfect foresight scenarios.
  8: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing sectors experience the most significant negative
    impacts on GDP and water use during water scarcity.
  9: Agriculture is the most heavily affected sector. Chemical and pharmaceutical
    manufacturing, and electricity generation are also significantly negatively impacted.
    Food and beverage industries experience significant economic impacts due to reliance
    on agricultural inputs. Electrical and vehicle manufacturing may experience positive
    effects due to changes in consumer spending and competitiveness trade effects.
Methodology:
  1: Utilizes a custom-built dynamic multisectoral model, incorporates behavioural
    and resilience aspects.
  2: 'Uses the DEMACRO-ESS model, a general equilibrium (CGE) model focused on Germany,
    simulating three investment model specifications: perfect foresight, myopic expectations,
    and imperfect foresight. Two water scarcity scenarios are simulated to identify
    system-wide resilience.'
  3: 'The methodology involves the use of DEMACRO-ESS simulation results with different
    investment behavior model specifications: Myopic, Imperfect foresight, and Perfect
    foresight.'
  4: Uses a custom-built dynamic multi-sectoral CGE model called DEMACRO-ESS, based
    on the AMOS CGE modelling framework with (neo) Keynesian characteristics. Parameterized
    on a 2020 Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) for Germany at monthly frequency.
  5: DEMACRO-ESS simulation; Multi-level production functions with constant elasticity
    of substitution (CES) technology; Armington (1969) link for trade and intermediate
    purchases; nested process to include water and land as natural capital; Equation
    (1) defining the demand for total capital.
  6: The analysis uses economic modeling with fixed labor force, varying employment,
    and wage curve considerations; scenarios are simulated by reducing water efficiency
    parameters.
  7: DEMARCO-ESS simulation results with different investment behaviour model specifications,
    using different Armington trade elasticity values to represent varying levels
    of economic openness.
  8: 'The analysis uses the DEMACRO-ESS model with three investment behavior model
    specifications: Myopic, Imperfect Foresight, and Perfect Foresight.'
  9: DEMACRO-ESS simulation results are presented for different investment behavior
    models (Myopic, Imperfect Foresight, Perfect Foresight). Results are applicable
    to a temporal water scarcity event.
More Notes:
  1: "Focuses on resilience in relation to the economy\u2019s capacity to recover\
    \ after a disturbance."
  2: The qualitative findings and policy recommendations have relevance for other
    countries and regions, despite the model focusing on Germany. Sector-specific
    outcomes are also examined.
  3: The effects vary across different scenarios and investment behavior model specifications,
    and each variable shows different recovery patterns post-shock.
  4: Analysis highlights the impact of firms' foresight on their response to water
    scarcity and the subsequent effects on the economy. The model framework enables
    controlled experimentation and sensitivity analysis.
  5: Model incorporates green and blue water, and crops, pastures, and other land
    types.
  7: The analysis assumes Germany's trade partners are operating under business-as-usual
    conditions, which may not be the case.
  9: The magnitude of impact is comparatively smaller for Chemical/Pharmaceutical
    and Electricity generation than for agriculture due to lower freshwater input
    dependence (1.2% and 1.4% of total inputs respectively vs. 8.7% for agriculture).
    Price increases in the agriculture sector indirectly impact other industries such
    as textiles, leather & wood, and wholesale & retail trade.
Quantitative material:
  1: "The analysis shows how firms\u2019 foresight, or lack thereof, impacts their\
    \ response to water scarcity and the subsequent impact on the economy."
  2: In the myopic expectations model, water scarcity leads to a decrease of 0.14%
    in GDP and a 0.17% decline in employment.
  3: The paper provides quantitative information with percentage changes from the
    base year for GDP, investment, employment, and water use in response to water
    scarcity events.
  4: Qualitative sectoral effects for GDP, employment, and water use are presented,
    with corresponding quantitative results in Appendices B and C. Magnitude of effects
    varies between scenarios.
  5: Heatmap (Fig. 2) visually representing impact levels (positive or negative) across
    sectors and scenarios; Appendices B and C provide corresponding quantitative results.
  6: A 30% decrease in water efficiency in the month of May is assumed; in the second
    scenario, the same percentage decrease in May and a 35% decrease in August are
    assumed.
  7: Table A1 presents the total GDP, employment, and water use results across all
    time periods, using Armington elasticities of 1.7, 2.7, and 3.7 (cumulative percentage
    change impacts).

    across sectors such as agriculture, mining, food, electricity, etc.
  9: Cumulative percentage change impacts across all simulation periods of different
    investment behaviour model specifications on sector effects of GDP, employment,
    and water use during a temporal water scarcity event. Table A4 lists specific
    percentage changes for various sectors under different investment behavior models
    (Myopic, Imperfect Foresight, Perfect Foresight).
