  18: Carbon emissions, Rainfall, Temperature, Inflation, Population, Unemployment,
    Temperature shocks, Rainfall shocks, Oil Dependence
  19: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population, unemployment.
  20: Carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population growth, unemployment,
    climate change, climate variability, temperature shocks, precipitation.
  21: CO2 emissions, rainfall, temperature, energy consumption, environmental degradation,
    oil consumption, unemployment
Highlights:
  1: Unemployment and economic growth are positively cointegrated in the long-run
    ARDL model; Carbon emissions have a negative effect on economic growth; Rainfall
    and temperature are cointegrated into economic growth in negative and positive
    ways respectively; Inflation and population have positive long-term effects on
    economic growth.
  2: Saudi Arabia can achieve both higher economic growth and lower carbon emissions
    simultaneously even without effectively addressing the unemployment problem; Nation
    should utilize modern scientific technologies to annual rainfall losses and to
    reduce annual temperature in some parts of the country in order to achieve higher
    economic growth.
  4: The effects of carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature, inflation, population,
    unemployment significantly influence economic growth in Saudi Arabia. There is
    no precise consensus on the effects of various environmental and macroeconomic
    variables on economic growth.
  5: The impact of climate change variability on economic growth remains inconclusive,
    with varying effects across tropical areas and climate zones. Rainfall has significant
    economy-wide effects, but the specific nature of these effects varies across studies.
    The effect of CO2 emissions on economic growth is also debated, with some studies
    finding positive, some negative, and some no significant relationships.
  6: The page highlights that GDP growth in Saudi Arabia is analyzed as a function
    of macroeconomic and environmental variables including CO2 emissions, rainfall,
    temperature, inflation, population, and unemployment.
  7: The ARDL approach is suitable because the data series have different orders of
    integration. The log transformation of variables is used.
  8: The optimal lag length for the long-run ARDL bounds model is found to be 2, enhancing
    the model's reliability in making strong policy decisions.
  9: Variables are cointegrated if the computed F-statistic is greater than the upper
    bound critical value. The computed F-statistic is large enough to reject the null
    hypothesis of no cointegration (based on a value of 12.38).
  10: Unemployment, population, rainfall, temperature, and CO2 emissions are found
    to significantly impact Saudi Arabia's GDP growth.
  11: Rainfall and CO2 emissions have a significant negative effect on Saudi Arabia's
    GDP growth; Unemployment rate and average temperature are found to have a significant
    positive effect on Saudi Arabia's GDP growth; Inflation has a positive but insignificant
    effect on GDP growth.
  12: In Saudi Arabia, GDP growth and temperature have risen concurrently since 1997,
    which contradicts findings from other studies. Population growth is positively
    correlated with long-term economic growth except for developing countries with
    high populations, such as China, India, and Indonesia.
  13: The ECM term suggests about 179% of disequilibrium is corrected within one period
    indicating strong long-run causality from independent variables to GDP growth.
  15: Exogenous shocks of independent variables to the dependent variable (likely
    GDPG) during the study period were not detected via IRF analysis; Variance decomposition
    shows that carbon emissions, unemployment, and inflation responded relatively
    well to economic growth, while rainfall, temperature, and population did not show
    decisive responses.
  16: Long-term economic growth in Saudi Arabia can benefit from reduced carbon emissions
    and managing rainfall and temperature impacts using scientific technologies.
  17: Dependence on foreign workers and unemployment of Saudi citizens pose significant
    risks to economic growth and social/political stability. Shifting to a green energy
    system is a viable alternative for long-term economic growth and reduced carbon
    emissions. Adapting to variations in rainfall and temperature is crucial for economic
    growth.
  19: Relationships between macroeconomic variables (carbon emissions, rainfall, temperature,
    inflation, population, unemployment) and economic growth are examined in various
    countries.
  20: Climate change and variability can have negative impacts on economic growth,
    agricultural productivity, and potentially lead to civil conflict. There are studies
    examining the relationship between carbon emissions, energy consumption, and economic
    growth.
  21: Several studies focus on the relationship between CO2 emissions, energy consumption,
    and economic growth in various countries and regions (Visegrad Group, Malaysia,
    China, Bangladesh, Philippines, South Asia, CIVETS countries, MENA countries).
Methodology:

    variables, with unit root tests performed using ADF, PP, and KPSS methods.
  7: The study employs the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds approach to
    cointegration to determine long-run relationships. The ARDL model accounts for
    endogeneity, multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation. It is
    applied to a time series dataset from 1990-2019.
  8: The analysis involves ARDL bounds testing of cointegration and selection of the
    optimal lag length using criteria like AIC, SC, or HQ.
  9: Cointegration analysis using bound F-statistic test to determine long-run relationships;
    VAR in polynomial graph for lags selection.
  10: The analysis uses an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach
    to examine the short-run and long-run relationships between macroeconomic variables
    and GDP growth. The study is applicable to the Saudi Arabian economy.

More Notes:
  1: Data is extracted from the World Bank and General Authority of Meteorology and
    Environmental Protection, Saudi Arabia.
  2: Saudi Arabia's economy is factor-driven and substantially depends on oil exports.
    Vision 2030 seeks to diversity the sources of income and economic growth. There
    is a lack of understanding the effects of environmental and macroeconomic factors
    on Saudi Arabian economic development.
  3: Focus is on Saudi Arabia due to its unique context; study aims to contribute
    towards achieving Vision 2030 goals.
  4: The page reviews literature on the dynamics of environmental and macroeconomic
    variables and their impact on economic growth. Conflicting outcomes exist across
    studies in different country contexts.
  5: The page is primarily a literature review summarizing existing research on the
    effects of climate variables on economic growth. There are contradictory findings
    across studies and disagreement among scholars. The literature focuses on GDP
    and sectoral impacts. The findings are applicable where the study has been performed,
    but generalizablity is disputed in the included literature.
  9: The study uses time series data from 1990 to approximately 2020 to analyze the
    trends of various macroeconomic and environmental variables and their relationships.
  10: The page focuses on short-run cointegration relationships (Table 5) and implies
    that long-run relationships are discussed in Table 7. The t-Bounds test leads

    between the dependent variable and regressors.
  11: The negative impact of rainfall on GDP growth is attributed to infrastructure
    limitations and low reliance on agriculture in Saudi Arabia; the negative impact
    of CO2 emissions is consistent with findings for India, ASEAN-8, and Nigeria.
  12: The study analyzes the effects of various macroeconomic factors on economic
    growth and unemployment, focusing on Saudi Arabia and comparing the findings with
    other countries. It highlights the complexities of these relationships, suggesting
    that demographic factors, institutional conditions, and specific national contexts
    play a crucial role.
