Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change (changes in flow regime); reservoir operation; land cover change;
    new irrigation and water diversion schemes; and urbanisation.
  10: Changes in average annual precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature
    due to climate change, also reservoir operation.
  11: Climate change (specifically A1b and B1 emission scenarios) and reservoir operations.
Highlights:
  2: Study assesses the individual and cumulative impacts of climate change (using
    multiple GCMs) and reservoir operation on the hydrology of the Mekong River.
  10: Climate change impacts on Mekong River discharge are projected to vary depending
    on the climate scenario and location. Reservoir operations also significantly
    affect discharge patterns, generally reducing peak discharges.
  11: Climate change and reservoir operations impact Mekong River discharge, with
    changes in flood peak discharge and flood volume depending on emission scenarios
    and the presence of reservoirs.
Methodology:
  2: Downscaled five GCMs and developed a reservoir operation optimisation algorithm
    to simulate reservoir operations of existing and planned hydropower dams. Incorporated
    the GCM data for 2032-2042 AD into a state-of-the-art distributed hydrological
    model.
  10: Hydrological modeling of the Mekong River basin under different climate change
    scenarios (A1b and B1) and with/without reservoir operations. The model runs compare
    the period 2032-2042 to the baseline period 1982-1992.
  11: The study uses a change factor downscaling approach to project climate change
    impacts on Mekong River discharge, using A1b and B1 emission scenarios for 2032-2042,
    compared to a baseline of 1982-1992. Flood pulse parameters (peak discharge, timing,
    flood volume) are calculated.
More Notes:
  2: Emphasis is on computing the possible changes in discharge at Kratie in Cambodia
    as the discharge there largely defines the nature of the flood pulse in the Tonle
    Sap floodplain.
  10: The paper uses multiple GCMs (ccA, cnA, giA, mpA, ncA, ccB, cnB, giB, mpB, ncB)
    to project future changes, providing a range of possible outcomes. The impact
    of reservoirs is assessed by comparing scenarios with and without their operation
    (BL+rv).
  11: The study focuses on hydrological changes, specifically river discharge and
    flood pulse parameters, not macroeconomic outcomes or costs and benefits of adaptation
    at a national level.
