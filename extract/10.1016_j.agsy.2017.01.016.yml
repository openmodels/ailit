Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change uncertainty, payment rate uncertainty (policy uncertainty).
  3: Climate change (increased weather variability, heat waves, dry spells, prolonged
    growing season); Policy uncertainty (farm subsidies)
  7: Climate change and related uncertainty, alongside policy-related uncertainty,
    are impacting agricultural sector characteristics.
  8: Sub-optimal temperatures, water deficit, nitrogen deficit, climate change (implicitly
    through impact on temperature, water, nitrogen), input and output prices, subsidies
  11: Climate and policy uncertainty affecting crop yields, agricultural production,
    land use, and social welfare.
  12: Impact of climate and policy uncertainty on the agricultural sector, specifically
    through changes in crop yield due to climate projections and policy payment rates.
  13: Climate uncertainty (represented by different GCMs and the SRES A1B emission
    scenario) impacting crop yields.
  14: Changes in minimum and maximum air temperature, precipitation, global solar
    radiation and evapotranspiration, CO2 concentration
  15: Projected future climate conditions impacting grass and spring wheat yields
  16: Climate change impacts on timothy grass and cereal yields, stochastic levels
    of direct payments (budget support to agriculture).
  17: Projected climate conditions (specifically using GCM GISS-AOM and HADCM3), changes
    in crop yields (timothy grass and spring wheat).
  19: Climate uncertainty and policy uncertainty impact production levels.
  21: Climate uncertainty, policy uncertainty.
  22: Climate uncertainty, policy uncertainty
  23: Climate uncertainty (affecting yields), policy uncertainty (affecting payment
    rates)
  24: Uncertainty in world market prices and domestic producer prices due to market
    regulations.
  26: Climate and policy uncertainty impacting the farming sector in Norway.
  27: No relevant information
  31: Climate change (temperature, precipitation changes); SRES emissions scenarios;
    soil extrapolation.
  35: Technical progress, Nominal world market prices
  39: Climate uncertainty (C) and policy uncertainty (P).
  40: Climate uncertainty (C) and policy uncertainty (P) related to climate change.
Highlights:
  2: Climate change can lead to lower cereal production, unchanged grass production,
    and higher farm incomes on average. Combining climate change and policy uncertainty
    increased mean farm income compared to only one source of uncertainty, but negatively
    affected land use and farm labour. Ignoring either climate change or policy uncertainty
    can lead to errors in agricultural production, land use, and welfare studies.
  3: Climate change poses risks to agriculture through increased weather variability,
    but also offers potential benefits like prolonged growing seasons. Policy uncertainty
    related to farm subsidies is also a significant risk factor for farmers. The paper
    focuses on these risks as they relate to farm profits and welfare.
  8: The models simulate the impact of climate-related factors (temperature, water,
    nitrogen) on agricultural outputs and farm income. Jordmod models the Norwegian
    agricultural sector with optimization models for farms that maximize farm income
    subject to various constraints.
  13: No relevant information
  14: Four GCMs were selected because they resulted in timothy grass yields covering
    the range of yields simulated by 15 GCMs under the A1B greenhouse gas emission
    scenario.
  15: Climate change will impact grass and spring wheat yields, and there is a current
    yield gap between simulated and actual yields in Norway that is accounted for
    in the modelling
  16: Climate change is projected to lead to an 11% increase in mean cereal yields
    by 2050 in the economic model. Policy uncertainty related to direct payments to
    agriculture is considered.
  17: Simulated timothy grass yield and spring wheat grain yield were significantly
    higher under the 2046-2065 climate projections than under the baseline 1961-1990
    climate scenarios, except for timothy grass yield under GISS-AOM.
  19: Animal production is less affected by climate and policy uncertainty than crop
    production; milk quotas mitigate production changes despite payment or yield fluctuations.
  21: Climate and policy uncertainty can significantly reduce agricultural area under
    unfavorable conditions. Policy uncertainty makes land rents much more volatile
    compared to climate uncertainty alone.
  22: Climate uncertainty and policy uncertainty both increase average agricultural
    income, but climate uncertainty leads to higher income volatility. Social welfare
    at the sector level is quite stable across scenarios.
  23: Climate uncertainty has significant effects on production, land use and farm
    income; climate change may increase average farm income but also increases its
    variance, potentially requiring policies to stabilize farm income.
  24: Uncertainty in policy might become dominant if larger standard deviations are
    assumed; positive effects of climate change on agricultural yields noted in northern
    Europe.
  26: Higher sensitivity to climate and policy uncertainty for producers suggests
    adaptation could benefit this group more than consumers.
  27: No relevant information
  31: Uncertainties in projected climate change impacts on European agriculture and
    ecosystems; effects of climate change on global food production.
  39: The table shows the decomposition of animal production under different scenarios
    of uncertainty (Climate, Policy, and both). There are some differences in the
    means and especially the standard deviations of animal production depending on
    the scenario considered.
  40: Both climate and policy uncertainty can significantly affect agricultural area
    and labour use. The standard deviation is higher under Climate & Policy uncertainty
    than under either uncertainty alone for agricultural area.
  41: The profitability of land and milk quotas vary under different uncertainties;
    maximum, minimum, and mean values are given for these scenarios.
Methodology:
  2: Stochastic version of Jordmod (price-endogenous spatial economic sector model
    of Norwegian agriculture) used with crop yield simulations from CSM-CERES-Wheat
    and LINGRA under IPCC A1B emission scenario for 2050 using four Global Climate
    Models (GCM). Uncertainty in payment rates are based on changes in past agricultural
    support levels. Compared three uncertainty scenarios with a deterministic scenario.
  3: The paper uses modelling, including LINGRA, CSM-CERES-Wheat, and DSSAT models,
    to assess the effects of climate change on agriculture in Norway.
  7: CSM-CERES-wheat and LINGRA models simulate growth and yield of wheat and timothy
    grass based on weather, soil, and crop management practices.
  8: Crop models (LINGRA, CSM-CERES-Wheat) simulate crop growth based on weather and
    soil data; Jordmod is a price-endogenous, spatial, comparative-static, partial
    equilibrium model for the agricultural sector that includes farm optimization
    models which maximize farm income.
  11: The analysis uses a modelling framework with contrasting scenarios concerning
    climate and policy uncertainty, utilizing models like Jordmod, LINGRA, and CSM-CERES-wheat.
  12: The analysis uses scenario development with model runs to explore different
    effects of climate and policy uncertainties by varying parameters; five model
    runs are used for each scenario to span out distribution of social welfare.
  13: Crop simulations (wheat and timothy grass) using CSM-CERES-wheat and LINGRA
    models, driven by historical and projected climate data from different GCMs under
    the A1B emission scenario. The LARS-WG tool was used to generate daily weather
    data. The analysis is applicable to South-Eastern Norway (spring wheat) and various
    locations in Norway (timothy grass).
  14: The LINGRA and CSM CERES-wheat models were run for 100 years of independent
    and stochastic daily weather data generated from four GCMs to simulate crop yields.
    The choice of GCMs was made to cover the range of yield uncertainty under the
    A1B scenario.
  15: LINGRA simulation model used to simulate grass and spring wheat yields under
    historical and projected climate conditions; Yields calibrated to fit Jordmod
    model; Harvesting schedule designed for dairy cow milk production; relative yield
    changes for future climate projections based on current yield gaps.
  16: Simulation of timothy grass yields for different locations, adjustment of original
    yield functions in Jordmod for wheat, rye, barley and oat based on simulated wheat
    yields under climate change scenarios. Stochastic direct payments based on past
    budget support development. Comparing scenario outcomes with a "certainty" model
    run with mean yields and mean payment rates.
  17: Crop simulation under projected climate conditions (2046-2065 climate scenarios
    compared to 1961-1990 baseline), but applied to an economic model (Jordmod) with
    a shorter timeframe (year 2030) due to uncertainty in exogenous parameters. Technical
    progress is modeled as annual reduction in input costs independent of yields.
  21: Comparison of different scenarios (fixed average climate and policy, climate
    uncertainty, policy uncertainty, combined climate and policy uncertainty) to evaluate
    impact of uncertainty on agricultural outcomes.
  23: Scenario analysis varying policy and climate within defined ranges to assess
    effects on the agricultural sector.

    input use. It looks at a range of possibilities from max to min outcomes.
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on Norwegian agriculture. It simulates climate impacts for
    2050 under a specific emission scenario (A1B).
  3: The study seems to focus on the agricultural sector in Norway, which is only
    a component of the overall economy. The introduction primarily discusses the impact
    of climate change on crop yields and farm income, and the potential effect of
    policy on these.
  8: The text focuses on the agricultural sector and the models used to analyze it.
    It does not directly mention GDP, budget balance, or other broad macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes. The page focuses primarily on microeconomic modelling in the
    agriculture sector.
  11: Each scenario uses a combination of various model simulations to create a pseudo-stochastic
    distribution of social welfare outcomes.
  13: This page focuses on the impact of climate change on agricultural yields (wheat
    and timothy grass) in Norway, which could be an input into a larger macroeconomic
    model but by itself doesn't present anything relevant to national-level costs/benefits
    or macroeconomic/macro-fiscal outcomes.
  14: The analysis focuses on the impact of climate variables on crop yields, specifically
    timothy grass and spring wheat, in northern Europe, particularly southeastern
    Norway.
  15: The paper seems to be describing a crop yield simulation model that feeds into
    an economic model (Jordmod). The relevant outcome would be the simulated crop
    yield changes due to climate change.
  16: The economic model used is Jordmod, which is comparative-static and has no explicit
    time dimension.
  21: The study focuses on the agricultural sector in Norway. Agricultural area in
    Norway is scarce, limiting the potential for expansion even under favorable conditions.
  22: The analysis focuses on the agricultural sector, specifically cereal and dairy
    farmers, and how climate and policy uncertainty affect their incomes and production
    patterns. A decrease in cereal production can increase the mean agricultural income
    due to the lower income of cereal farmers compared to dairy farmers.
  23: The study focuses on the agricultural sector in Norway. Well-functioning trade
    and international markets mitigate the effect of uncertainty on consumers.
  26: Nitrogen intensity is a potential feedback mechanism; shift from cereal to forage
    production as a climate adaptation strategy.
  27: No relevant information
  31: The page primarily focuses on agricultural impacts of climate change, which
    can have macroeconomic and fiscal consequences through trade, food security, and
    agricultural subsidies.
  35: Technical progress is an own assumption, while other exogenous variables are
    obtained from Statistics Norway (2010) and OECD and FAO (2011).
  39: The table focuses on animal production, which is a sector-specific outcome,
    and not on overall macroeconomic or macro-fiscal variables. The model is "Jordmod".
  40: The page focuses on agricultural input use, which is only indirectly relevant
    to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. The source of calculations is noted as 'Own
    calculations'.

    of uncertainty were combined, the highest income was about 25 per cent higher
    than the lowest income, but this difference fell to about 15 (8) per cent when
    climate (policy) uncertainty was concerned. In all three scenarios, the highest
    value of social welfare was at most 3 per cent higher than the lowest value. The
    maximum value of quota rents in the C&P scenario was only 20 per cent higher than
