Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on marine fisheries.
  4: Projected sea surface temperature increases are the main driver of risk considered
    in the paper.
  6: Climate change impacts on marine fisheries
  9: Climate change impacts on marine fisheries (exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity).
    Specifically, impacts on fishers (number of fishers), fisheries landings (total),
    fish protein (proportion of all animal protein).
  11: Climate change impacts on fisheries; Latitudinal variation in Exclusive Economic
    Zones (EEZs); Ineffective fisheries management; Reliance on fish protein as a
    proportion of animal protein
  12: Climate change impacts on marine fisheries
Highlights:
  1: Seven out of the ten most vulnerable countries are Small Island Developing States;
    more than 87% of least developed countries are within the top half of the vulnerability
    index.
  4: The paper focuses on assessing vulnerability of marine fisheries in least developed
    countries to climate change, using an index based on exposure to sea surface temperature
    increases, sensitivity of the fisheries sector, and adaptive capacity of the countries.
  9: LDCs tend to be more vulnerable than OECD countries. Exposure to climate change
    impacts on fisheries is spread across both LDCs and OECD member states, suggesting
    that development levels do not necessarily dictate exposure. Adaptive capacity
    can be enhanced at national and sub-national levels more directly and timely than
    exposure can be reduced.
  11: Least Developed Countries (LDCs) are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts
    on fisheries but have low per capita carbon emissions. China, Indonesia, and India,
    identified as having the most potential for fisheries management improvement,
    are also in the first quartile of the vulnerability index.
  12: Reducing vulnerability to climate change impacts on marine fisheries is closely
    linked to development objectives. Earmarking climate finance to enhance adaptive
    capacity in countries scoring highly on the vulnerability index could bring a
    wide range of benefits.
Methodology:
  1: A vulnerability index is constructed using 12 primary variables, aggregating
    indices for exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity based on the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change framework.
  4: The study recalculates a vulnerability index based on the IPCC framework, adapting
    the methodology of Allison et al. [14] with modifications. It normalizes variables
    on a scale from 0 to 1 and calculates component indices for Exposure, Sensitivity,
    and Adaptive Capacity. The vulnerability index (V) is then calculated using these
    components, following the equation V = E + S + AC.
  6: Calculates indices for climate change vulnerability of marine fisheries in least
    developed countries based on sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Sensitivity is
    calculated using number of fishers, share of fisheries exports, percentage of
    fishers in the active population, weight of fisheries landings, and share of fish
    protein in total consumption. Adaptive capacity is calculated using fisheries
    subsidies, ratio of industrial to small-scale fisheries, healthy life expectancy,
    governance capacity, education levels, and GDP per capita. All variables are normalized
    to a 0-1 scale and averaged.
  9: The study covers Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of 147 countries and assesses
    vulnerability due to climate change impacts on marine fisheries. It uses a vulnerability
    index composed of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.
  11: Vulnerability index construction considering exposure, sensitivity and adaptive
    capacity related to fisheries. The analysis compares the constructed vulnerability
    index with per capita carbon emissions across countries.
  12: Uses a global index of vulnerability to assess the impacts of climate change
    on marine fisheries in least developed countries.
More Notes:
  1: A negative correlation exists between vulnerability and per capita carbon emissions.
  4: The data used for the original index was updated with more recent data.
  9: Reduction in sensitivity can lead to negative outcomes like loss of livelihoods
    or revenue. Lower vulnerability scores in OECD countries are partially attributable
    to a continuous drop in employment in the fisheries sector.
  11: The homogenization of SST anomalies across EEZs disproportionately affects countries
    with high latitudinal variation. Socio-economic variables used for sensitivity
    and adaptive capacity indices mask regional or local variabilities. The study
    suggests the need for capacity building and transfer of marine technology, particularly
    for vulnerable states.
  12: The research uses climate models from CMIP5. Supporting information includes
    country data and classifications for calculating vulnerability indices at different
    representative concentration pathways, lists of CMIP5 models used, and lists of
    countries excluded from the index due to lack of data.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Food security, livelihoods, and public health are negatively influenced by climate
    change impacts on marine fisheries.
  4: This paper is focused on vulnerability of marine fisheries in least developed
    countries, but does not focus on macroeconomic outcomes (GDP effects, productivity
    loss, interest, inflation, etc.) or fiscal outcomes (budget balance, borrowing
    costs, public expenditure or revenue, etc.) or measures of economic costs and/or
    benefits (or related measures like ROI, NPV) of nation-wide adaptation.
  9: Loss of livelihoods, greater unemployment, loss in revenue, reduction in fish
    protein as proportion of all animal protein (negative health outcomes).
  11: No relevant information
  12: Food security, income generation, natural resource management, vulnerability
    to climate change impacts
Quantitative material:
  1: A vulnerability index of 147 countries is calculated.
  4: The paper provides a vulnerability index (V) calculated as a function of Exposure
    (E), Sensitivity (S), and Adaptive Capacity (AC), all normalized on a scale from
    0 to 1. Equations for calculating each component index (E, S, AC) are provided.
    Variables included are projected sea surface temperature anomalies (E), number
    of fishers, share of marine fisheries exports, percentage of fishers in the economically
    active population, weight of total fisheries landings, share of marine fish protein
    in total protein consumption (S), fisheries subsidies, ratio of industrial to
    small-scale fisheries, healthy life expectancy, governance capacity, education
    levels, and per capita GDP (AC).
  9: The study provides a vulnerability index (V) based on exposure (E), sensitivity
    (S), and adaptive capacity (AC) for Least Developed Countries and OECD member
    states, broken down by quartiles.
  11: "Negative correlation between per capita carbon emissions and vulnerability\
    \ to climate change impacts on fisheries (Spearman's \u03C1 = -0.60, R2 = 0.300,\
    \ p < 0.0001)."
  12: "Climate funds estimated at up to USD 650 billion annually for all countries\
    \ [59]; Dedicated financing with over USD 9 billion approved for new projects\
    \ in 2014 \u2013 nearly double 2012 levels [60]."
