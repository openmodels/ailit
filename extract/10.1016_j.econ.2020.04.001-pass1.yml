Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change scenarios proposed by the IPCC.
  2: Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) leading to global warming
    and climate change, specifically changes in agricultural productivity due to temperature
    increase and rainfall reduction.
  3: Changes in rainfall and temperature responsible for climate change will impact
    the level of agricultural productivity in a heterogeneous way.
  4: Climate change
  6: Decrease of agricultural productivity due to climate change.
  8: Shocks affect agricultural land productivity, excluding pasture and planted forest
    land.
  9: Negative shock of land productivity, climate change affecting agriculture and
    livestock sectors due to dependence on temperature and rainfall, deforestation.
  10: Climate change impacting crop area, pasture, planted forest, and natural forest.
  11: Changes in rainfall and temperature as a result of climate change.
  12: Climate change impacts on agricultural production
  13: Changes in rainfall and temperature due to climate change leading to a decrease
    in agricultural productivity.
  14: "Climate change impacts on the agricultural sector, affecting states like Mato\
    \ Grosso, Tocantins, and Par\xE1 more significantly."
  15: Changes in land use types (agriculture, pasture, planted forest, and unused
    land) over time influence the outcomes.
  17: Sectoral impacts on agricultural production, influenced by parameterization
    of land supply elasticity and primary factor substitution elasticity.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change in the Legal Amazon leads to a loss in real GDP of 1.18% in 2049,
    impacting agricultural production and employment. Deforestation will increase.
  2: Climate change will impact agricultural productivity in Brazil, leading to an
    average reduction of 18% nationally, with regional variations. This will affect
    various macroeconomic factors including GDP, employment, and food security. The
    Legal Amazon region is particularly vulnerable.
  3: Climate change has great potential to trigger significant costs in the Brazilian
    economy especially in agriculture and the Northern region.
  4: Climate change is expected to negatively impact agricultural production per hectare
    in the Legal Amazon region, with varying degrees of intensity across municipalities.
  8: The study captures only a portion of climate change impacts, focusing on variations
    in precipitation and temperature affecting agriculture.
  9: Climate change-induced decline in land productivity leads to expansion of agricultural
    frontier, mainly at the expense of pasture and forests (deforestation). The effect
    on each mesoregion depends on its productive structure and intersectoral/interregional
    relations.
  10: Climate change is projected to lead to changes in land use in the Legal Amazon
    region, impacting agriculture, pasture, planted forest, and natural forest areas.
    For the Legal Amazon, a total of 2.10 million hectares are projected to be gained
    in agriculture, while 1.06 million hectares are lost in pasture, 0.10 million
    hectares are lost in planted forest, and 0.90 million hectares are lost in natural
    forest, accumulated between 2030 and 2049.
  11: "Climate change will negatively impact agricultural production in the Legal\
    \ Amazon, with sugar cane being the most affected crop; The mesoregion MetropolitanadeBel\xE9\
    m is projected to be the most affected due to its small territorial extension\
    \ and unavailability of lands for conversion to compensate productivity declines;\
    \ Pasture areas will be reduced due to expansion of crop areas."
  12: "Some crops in specific regions can benefit from climate change, such as rice,\
    \ corn and soybeans in Amap\xE1, Norte Amazonense, Sul Amazonense, and Sul de\
    \ Roraima. The simulations also pointed to the reduction of livestock production."
  13: Climate change will be prejudicial to the economy of the Legal Amazon. The most
    affected states are Mato Grosso and Tocantins due to their dependence on agriculture.
  14: Significant negative impact of climate change on the economic and social dynamics
    of the Legal Amazon region.
  17: Results for GDP, investment, and household consumption are robust, with slight
    sensitivity in sectoral agricultural production.
Methodology:
  1: Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, REGIA - Inter-regional General Equilibrium
    Model for the Brazilian Legal Amazon.
  2: The paper aims to project the economic and land use impacts of climate change
    on the Legal Amazon region using the REGIA model, an interregional CGE model for
    Brazil.
  3: Literature review of studies on climate change impacts on the Brazilian economy.
  4: "The map showing the effect of climate change is elaborated by the authors based\
    \ on Assun\xE7\xE3o and Chein (2016)."
  6: REGIA is based on the TERM model (Horridge et al., 2005) and incorporates features
    like regional disaggregation of the Legal Amazon, a CGE structure with recursive
    dynamics, and land use modeling.
  8: The closure for simulations includes historical and baseline closures from 2006
    to 2050 and a policy scenario where macroeconomic variables are endogenous.
  9: Uses the REGIA model to simulate the effects of climate change, looking at the
    difference between a baseline scenario and a scenario with climate change effects.
    The model projects land use dynamics considering total available area, productivity,
    and relative profitability of crops.
  10: The table presents accumulated values for the period 2030-2049. Figure 3 shows
    accumulated percentage variation between 2030 and 2049 in relation to a baseline
    scenario. The methodology is unspecified.
  11: Simulation of climate change impacts on agricultural production, pasture and
    planted forest areas, comparing 2030-2049 to a baseline scenario; analysis is
    specific to the Legal Amazon region of Brazil.
  12: The study uses simulations to project the impact of climate change on agricultural
    production and macroeconomic variables.
  13: Simulation of the effects of productivity decrease due to climatic changes on
    agricultural crops in the Brazilian Legal Amazon from 2030 to 2049.
  15: A transition matrix was built based on the methodology of Carvalho (2014) and
    calibrated with TerraClass satellite data from 2008 and 2010 and Agricultural
    Census data from 1995 and 2006 for the Brazilian Legal Amazon. The model allows
    land to move between agriculture, pasture and planted forest, and the unused land
    to become one of three.
  17: Gaussian quadrature methodology; sensitivity analysis uses a 50% interval with
    uniform distribution for parameter variations.
More Notes:
  1: "The states of Mato Grosso, Tocantins, and Par\xE1 are most affected due to their\
    \ dependence on agriculture."
  2: "The study focuses on the Legal Amazon region of Brazil. The climate change scenarios\
    \ are based on information provided by \xB8\xE3o and Chein (2016) for the period\
    \ 2030 to 2049. The study uses an interregional CGE model called REGIA to assess\
    \ economic and land use impacts."
  3: Effects of climate change are heterogeneous regionally and among economic sectors,
    it is important to measure impacts at the most disaggregated regional level possible.
  4: "The paper highlights the need to understand and measure the economic impacts\
    \ of changes in agricultural productivity for the formulation of adaptation policies.\
    \ The Legal Amazon region comprises the federal states of Amap\xE1, Amazonas,\
    \ Acre, Rond\xF4nia, Roraima, Tocantins, Par\xE1, Mato Grosso and the municipalities\
    \ of Maranh\xE3o state situated west of 44th meridian."
  6: The REGIA model includes an indirect land use change (ILUC) module.
  10: The analysis focuses on the Brazilian Legal Amazon. The maps presented in Figure
    3 show the spatial distribution of changes in natural forest and agriculture percentages,
    but the exact methodology used to generate these projections is not described
    on this page.
  11: The analysis focuses on the Legal Amazon region of Brazil. The conversion of
    pasture to cropland is identified as a key dynamic. The impact on cassava production,
    while smaller in percentage terms, is noted to be important for food security
    of vulnerable populations.
  12: The analysis focuses on the Legal Amazon region of Brazil. The tables present
    percentage deviations from a baseline scenario for the period 2030-2049.
  13: Impacts on livestock and forest production are indirect in the model, mediated
    by factor allocation responses to agricultural shocks. The mesoregions that would
    suffer the greatest effects are located in the eastern and southern regions of
    the Legal Amazon.
  15: The transition matrix is adjusted for the next period by distributing the current
    stock of land based on a CET function, which responds to changes in the average
    remuneration of each type of land. The transition matrix is endogenously modified,
    and the probabilities are modeled as a function of the variation in remuneration
    of each type of land according to land supply elasticity.
