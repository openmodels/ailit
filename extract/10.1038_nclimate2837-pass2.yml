Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, global warming, rapid economic development, population growth,
    urbanization, and increasing hydro-climatic intensity leading to shorter, less
    frequent precipitation events and longer dry spells.
  2: Expansion of drylands
  4: Changes in aridity, specifically transitions to drier or wetter subtypes in drylands,
    impacting areas mainly in developing countries.
  5: Global warming leading to dryland expansion, higher vapour pressure deficit,
    decreased soil moisture, and increased sensible heat flux.
Highlights:
  1: Drylands are projected to cover half of the global land surface by the end of
    this century under climate change. Current climate models underestimate the rate
    of dryland expansion.
  2: CMIP5-EM severely underestimates the expansion of drylands in the historical
    period compared to observed data. The corrected CMIP5-EM is more comparable to
    observations.
  4: Drying areas are mainly distributed in eastern Siberia, northeastern China, western
    Asia, central Africa and Canada; 78% of increased drylands occur in developing
    countries.
  5: Warming and drying trends reinforce each other through a positive feedback cycle,
    exacerbating dryland expansion and reducing GPP.
Methodology:
  1: Uses historical data to bias-correct CMIP5 (Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison
    Project) projections. Compares historical values of global observed AI and CMIP5-EM
    values over 58 years (1948-2005). Projects aridity changes from 2006-2100.
  2: Analysis of observed data (1948-2005) and CMIP5-EM simulation to determine trends
    in aridity index (AI) and subtype changes. Future projections are also mentioned,
    using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 and 4.5.
More Notes:
  1: Study aims to provide a clear understanding of the spatial and temporal evolution
    of drylands in the future to motivate early and effective mitigation of desertification.
  2: The aridity index (AI) is a key metric used in the analysis. The table includes
    percentage of global land area with drying trend and neighboring subtype changes
    (e.g., arid to hyper-arid). The analysis also seems to include global mean aridity
    index.
  5: The paper highlights the vulnerability of developing countries to dryland expansion.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Reduced carbon sequestration and enhanced regional warming in drylands. Risk
    of land degradation and desertification in drylands of developing countries. Population
    affected by water scarcity and land degradation.
  2: No relevant information
  5: Reduced gross primary production (GPP) due to warming and drying trends impacting
    photosynthesis.
Quantitative material:
  1: Dryland area projected to increase by 23% under RCP8.5 and 11% under RCP4.5 relative
    to 1961-1990 baseline, equaling 56% and 50%, respectively, of total land surface.
    Observed AI decreased by -0.050 per 58yr. Drying regions cover up to 66% of the
    global land area. 78% of dryland expansion and 50% of population growth will occur
    under RCP8.5 in developing countries.
  2: true
  5: Approximately 78% of the newly expanded dryland areas will be located in developing
    countries.
