Drivers of Risk:
  8: Various scenarios of climate change impacting hydrological conditions as explored
    using GEOM.
  10: Climate change leading to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns.
  14: Changes in average flow in the Ganges basin due to the A2 emissions scenario;
    Changes in runoff across space in the Ganges basin.
  17: Changes in water availability/flow (flooding and low flow) in the Ganges basin,
    influenced by climate change (GCMs).
  18: Climate change impacts on water availability, shifting seasonality of water
    availability (affecting irrigation water use), potential lower or higher water
    use in irrigation.
  19: Sea level rise can increase inundation, storm surge effects, and seawater intrusion;
    changes in river hydrology and sediment loads influence land erosion and accretion;
    extreme weather events can increase salinity fluctuations.
  20: Climate change impacting river flows (both high and low flow events), with the
    range of flows across GCMs (General Circulation Models) being larger than the
    effect of infrastructure. Specifically, drier climate models leading to less hydropower
    benefit. Changes in flows impacting irrigation potential. Economic valuation of
    downstream water use in Bangladesh.
  21: Shocks from climate change, including temperature increases, changes in precipitation,
    and impacts on the water cycle, glacier melt, and droughts/floods.
  22: Climate change impacts on temperature, rainfall, and runoff in the Ganges basin.
  23: Climate change impacts on water resources, extreme events (droughts and floods),
    and long-term climate and demographic trends beyond 2050.
Highlights:
  8: Simulation models investigate the socio-economic benefits of water management
    under different climate scenarios, focusing on maximizing hydropower, water supply
    benefits, and minimizing flood damages.
  10: Climate models predict rising average temperatures, but precipitation change
    is less clear. Temperature increases are highest during winter months and in upstream
    areas. The study analyzes the impacts on hydropower production, surface water
    use, and the potential economic implications of these changes.
  14: The projections for the Ganges basin show considerable variability depending
    on the GCM used, both in terms of average monthly flow and spatial runoff changes.
    The projections show high flow rates in the middle of the year and low flow rates
    at the beginning and end of the year.
  17: The paper analyzes the impact of different dam configurations and climate scenarios
    on water flow and power generation in the Ganges basin.
  18: Climate models suggest the possibility of either lower or higher hydropower
    production in Nepal. Shifting seasonality of water availability affects irrigation
    water use. Low season flows in Bangladesh appear to increase somewhat in the median
    scenario.
  19: Optimal water allocation to irrigation or low flow augmentation in Bangladesh
    is highly sensitive to assumptions about the relative values of these two activities;
    there is little tradeoff between hydropower and downstream water use.
  20: Infrastructure development in the Ganges basin generates large economic benefits,
    particularly from energy production and irrigation, but is vulnerable to climate
    change impacts (particularly drier conditions). The costs of infrastructure are
    balanced against the benefits under various discount rates. The impact of climate
    models on flows is higher than the impact of infrastructure itself.
  21: The potential economic impact of different water management scenarios on hydropower,
    irrigation, and delta flow values.
  22: "Dams could deliver significant energy and dry season water supply benefits\
    \ in the Ganges region, worth US$4\u20138 billion/yr. The value of additional\
    \ irrigation investments is less clear."
  23: Emphasis should be placed on flexible approaches that avoid costly mistakes
    and accommodate adaptive management as more information becomes available. Policy-makers
    should favor robust development strategies that perform well over a wide range
    of potential conditions and/or deliver immediate benefits regardless of climate
    change.
Methodology:
  8: The analysis uses the SWAT model for hydrology simulation and GEOM for exploring
    economic implications of climate change, applying nonlinear optimization techniques
    within the General Algebraic Modeling System.
  10: Analysis comparing basin performance under historical and climate change conditions,
    using climate model projections (A2 and A1B emissions scenarios) and exploring
    sensitivity to downstream water value assumptions.
  14: Uses WCRP CMIP3 data downscaled by Maurer & Hidalgo (2008) to project flow and
    runoff changes. The analysis shows a range of projected outcomes based on different
    GCMs. Results are applicable to 2050 for flow projections and 2040-2069 for runoff
    changes.
  17: Compares water flow and power generation under different climate models (GCMs)
    and dam management scenarios (DamsRange, SmallMed, Mega). Uses hydrological models.
    Results are applicable to the Ganges basin. The results refer to the year 2050.
  18: Climate models (GCMs) are used to project changes in water availability and
    hydropower production; optimization model allows use of groundwater during periods
    of surface water shortage.
  19: Uses the SWAT model to assess water availability in the Ganges.
  20: Analysis of high flow events, modeling of flows on a monthly scale, economic
    valuation of benefits from energy production and irrigation. Comparison of different
    climate scenarios (GCMs) and infrastructure development scenarios.
  21: Economic valuation under different dam scenarios using GCM projections for the
    A2 emissions scenario for 2050.
  22: Estimated temperature, rainfall, and runoff over the basin using 16 globally
    recognized GCMs for a single (A2) high emissions trajectory (IPCC, 2007).
  23: A framework developed in the paper can be used to estimate climate damages through
    changes in water resources by characterizing the range of losses under a range
    of scenarios.
More Notes:
  14: The page focuses on hydrological impacts of climate change. While these impacts
    could potentially influence macroeconomic outcomes, this link is not explicitly
    made in the provided page, and the relevant macroeconomic data is not included.
  17: The page focuses on water resources management and potential climate change
    impacts related to water availability and power generation in Bangladesh.
  18: The accuracy of GCMs in simulating monsoon precipitation in South Asia is questionable,
    requiring further research and improved climate modeling. Reduced water availability
    in some model runs may be overestimated due to irrigators' potential adaptation.
  19: The western movement of the river system is protecting the western coast of
    Bangladesh, and land accretion has in recent years exceeded that lost to erosion.
  20: The smaller dams enable more irrigation than the mega dams because they regulate
    flows in the Gandak tributary. Decreased flows in the Gandak negatively impact
    benefits under climate change relative to historical flow conditions. The study
    mentions that more detailed project appraisals are needed to assess full environmental
    and resettlement implications, as well as opportunity costs.
  22: Focus on managing current hydrological variability is a good place to start
    in addressing and adapting to the potential future climate change challenges of
    the Ganges.
  23: The hydrology of the Himalaya and the value of water in the delta are poorly
    understood. There are no publicly available streamflow records for the rivers
    in the Gangetic plain in India.

    \ of hydropower decreases by only 5\u201310%, in both historical and climate change\
    \ analyses"
  20: "Infrastructure development enables some reductions of flow peaks. With the\
    \ wettest GCM, full infrastructure development reduces above-threshold flows by\
    \ about 15 BCM (15% of base), median reduction is about 12 BCM (40% of base).\
    \  Benefits from dam development range from US$6\u20139 billion/yr. Irrigation\
    \ benefits increase by about US$1.7 billion/yr for full development. Full set\
    \ of infrastructures is estimated to cost about US$35 billion. Total annual benefits\
    \ could range from US$8 to 10 billion/yr. Incremental benefits US$4-6 billion/year\
    \ with low downstream use values. Investments could generate economic net benefits\
    \ for discount rates below 6.1% (conservative) or 7.9% (moderate productivity)."
