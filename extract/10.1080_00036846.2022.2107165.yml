Highlights:
  6: During hotter temperatures, the marginal utility of working decreases, and individuals
    reallocate their time more toward non-working activities. The impact of an increase
    in temperatures is non-linear; at relatively colder temperatures, an increase
    in temperatures results in a higher marginal utility of working. The marginal
    effect of increasing temperatures on working hours is expected to differ between
    'high-risk' and 'low-risk' groups.
  8: Some Mediterranean coastal governorates (Damietta and Port Said in Egypt, Nabeula,
    Sousse, and Tunis in Tunisia, and Madaba in Jordan) are particularly vulnerable
    and experiencing more risk than other governorates.
  12: The impact of climate variables on labor supply is expected to differ between
    high-risk and low-risk occupation groups.
  13: Climate variability impacts labor supply; negative binomial regression is the
    preferred model specification.
  14: Higher temperatures initially increase working hours but at a decreasing rate.
    Higher humidity reduces working hours. Older age increases working hours at a
    decreasing rate. Females work fewer hours than males. Higher education levels
    don't necessarily increase working hours.
  15: Humidity significantly reduces labor working hours in high-risk groups but not
    in low-risk groups.
  17: Weekly average maximum temperature and its square, weekly average relative humidity
    and its square, age and its square, gender of the respondent, and household wealth
    score are all statistically significant (p < 0.001 level) in explaining the variance
    of the unspecified outcome.
  20: Household wealth score is a statistically significant predictor of the unspecified
    outcome.
  21: Higher weekly average maximum temperature is associated with increased working
    hours, but this effect diminishes at higher temperatures. Higher weekly average
    relative humidity is associated with decreased working hours. Female respondents
    work significantly fewer hours than male respondents. Higher education levels
    (especially secondary, post-secondary, and university) are generally associated
    with fewer working hours, particularly in the Low-Risk group. The effect of age
    on working hours is non-linear, with working hours increasing with age but at
    a decreasing rate.
  22: Hours worked have a non-linear relationship with weekly average maximum temperature,
    peaking at around 30 degrees. The relationship is shown graphically for both High-Risk
    and Low-Risk groups.
  23: Climate change impacts social and economic dimensions of societies. There is
    a negative correlation between humidity and some economic outcome for the high-risk
    group.
  24: Temperature affects labor working hours differently for high-risk and low-risk
    groups; Relative humidity negatively impacts labor working hours for high-risk
    groups.
Methodology:
  6: The study uses unbalanced longitudinal survey data from the Integrated Labor
    Market Panel Surveys (ILMPSs) of Egypt (2006, 2012, 2018), Jordan (2010, 2016),
    and Tunisia (2014) to examine the impact of climate changes on labor supply. Regression
    models are conducted separately for 'high-risk' and 'low-risk' groups.
  8: Exploits spatial and temporal variation in observations to capture the impact
    of changes in meteorological indicators on the number of hours worked by respondents
    per week; categorizes governorates according to their vulnerability to climate
    impacts based on exceeding weekly averages of maximum temperature, relative humidity,
    and working hours.
  9: Authors' graph using NOAA CPC Global and NASA POWER data.
  10: Poisson regression model used to analyze the impact of climate indicators on
    labor supply, controlling for socioeconomic and demographic variables. Coefficients
    are estimated using maximum likelihood.
  11: The paper uses Poisson and Negative Binomial (NB2) regression models to analyze
    the impact of climate variables. The Negative Binomial model is preferred when
    the equidispersion assumption of the Poisson model is violated (i.e., overdispersion
    is present in the dependent variable).
  12: Regression analysis exploiting spatial and temporal variation in climate observations.
    Workers are divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on occupation (ISIC-4).
    Fixed effects are used to control for seasonality, governorate, and year.
  13: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Poisson regression with robust standard errors,
    and negative binomial regressions are used to examine the impact of climate variability
    on labor supply. Negative binomial regression is preferred due to overdispersion
    of data.
  14: The analysis uses regression to examine the relationship between weather variables,
    demographic factors, and hours worked. The results are based on 45,907 observations.
  17: OLS, Poisson, and Negative Binomial regressions are used to model the relationship
    between weather variables and individual characteristics on an unspecified outcome.
    The t-statistics are included in parenthesis under the coefficients. The models
    include controls for age, gender, education level, and household wealth score.
  20: The analysis uses regressions to model the relationship between household wealth
    score and an unspecified outcome, controlling for the month and year of visit
    and governorate of the respondent. The Poisson regression in Column (2) uses robust
    standard errors. The AIC and BIC are also listed.
  22: Regression analysis is used to predict the relationship between various factors
    and the outcome. The regressions control for the month and year of visit and governorate
    of the respondent. Predicted margins (with 95% confidence intervals) are graphically
    presented to illustrate the relationship between weekly average maximum temperature
    and hours worked for 'High-Risk Group' and 'Low-Risk Group'.
  23: Uses matched data from an unbalanced longitudinal survey data from the ILMPSs
    of Egypt, Jordan, and Tunisia, spanning 2006-2018, along with a globally gridded
    climate dataset. Employs panel methodologies and weather data.

    indicators on individual-level labor supply, controlling for socioeconomic and
    demographic variables; Matching monthly climatology variables (long-term mean
    maximum temperature, temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity) with ILMPS
    dataset.
  26: El-Raey et al. (1999) investigates adaptation to sea level rise impacts in Egypt;
    Somanathan et al. (2015) investigate the impact of temperature on productivity
    and labor supply using Indian manufacturing data; Zivin and Neidell (2014) investigate
    temperature's impact on the allocation of time in a way that informs understanding
    of climate change.
More Notes:
  6: The paper links ILMPS datasets with globally gridded weather and climate datasets.
  9: The maps suggest a spatial analysis of climate-related risks, potentially focusing
    on the impact of temperature and humidity on specific regions within MENA countries.
    The temperature color scale bar included on the central map suggests this is some
    measurement relating to climate.

    (2014). The sample consists of 45,907 observations.
  14: The paper compares the impact of temperature on hours worked for a 'high-risk'
    group versus a 'low-risk' group (Tables 3-5, not shown).
  20: The outcome being modeled is not specified on this page.
  22: The paper separates individuals into 'High-Risk Group' and 'Low-Risk Group,'
    but the criteria for this classification is not provided on this page. The reference
    group for education levels is Illiterate.
  23: The exact nature of the linear prediction (y-axis) is not specified, but the
    graph implies humidity has a greater impact on the high-risk group than the low-risk
    group. The identity of the high- and low-risk groups is not specified.
  24: Study focuses on the MENA region; Future research could examine the impact of
    climate change on productivity indicators such as total factor productivity by
    sector; High-risk activities in the MENA region are strategically important and
    more exposed to climate change.

Quantitative material:
  6: The study uses spatial daily climate indicators such as maximum temperature and
    humidity during the week for which the respondent is reporting their hours of
    work.
  13: "Average maximum temperature ranges between 9 and 44 \xB0C; average hours worked\
    \ per week is 46 (variance = 301.37)"
  14: The paper provides descriptive statistics on the variables. For example, the
    average number of hours worked per week is 46.05 with a standard deviation of
    17.34, and the average weekly maximum temperature is 26.10 with a standard deviation
    of 7.75.

    Binomial regressions.
  20: Household wealth score is statistically significant (p < 0.01) and positively
    correlated (coefficient of 0.613 in the first column, 0.0131 in the second, 0.0134
    in the third) with an unspecified outcome.
  21: The table provides average marginal effects (dy/dx) on labor working hours from

    for High-Risk and Low-Risk groups. T-statistics and significance levels (p < 0.10,
    ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01) are provided.
  23: The High-Risk group's linear prediction of some unspecified outcome decreases
    from about 52 to 42 as weekly average relative humidity increases from 10 to 80.
