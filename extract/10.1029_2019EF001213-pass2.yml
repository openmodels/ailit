Drivers of Risk:
  3: Physical climate change (CC) impacts on agriculture; Own production affecting
    domestic supply and consumption; Abroad production affecting domestic consumption
  4: Volatile export earnings and associated ability to import; Reliance on very few
    suppliers for grain imports; Risk of trade disruption as a result of war or political
    tensions.
  6: "Changes in capital (K), climate change (\u03C4C) affecting land productivity,\
    \ and consumption (Gd)."
  8: Climate change impact on yield of maize, wheat, and rice, leading to land productivity
    changes.
  12: Temperature (dominant factor) and Precipitation (marginally positive impact).
  13: Dominated by temperature impacts with precipitation having a positive impact.
  14: Temperature change in RCP8.5 scenario 2100
  15: Temperature change under RCP8.5 scenario by 2100 impacting grain production.
  16: Climate change impacts on grain production
  18: Direct climate change impacts via land productivity, particularly for maize.
  19: Direct climate change impacts via land productivity, particularly affecting
    wheat.
  20: Direct climate change impacts on land productivity, particularly for wheat and
    maize
  21: Direct climate change impacts via land productivity, particularly for rice.
  22: Temperature changes in the RCP8.5 scenario by 2100.
  23: Global warming leading to reduced grain production and climate change (CC).
Highlights:
  4: Certain countries pursue a policy target of gain self-sufficiency ratio (SSR)
    for food security because of various risk factors, including reliance on few suppliers,
    volatile export earnings, or trade disruptions.
  6: "The analysis focuses on how climate change (\u03C4C) and other factors impact\
    \ a nation's ability to meet its grain needs domestically."
  12: Grain production losses are dominated by temperature increases. Adaptation can
    mitigate these losses considerably. Losses are generally greater in 2100 than
    in 2050, except possibly under RCP2.6. RCP8.5 leads to the largest losses.
  13: Under climate scenarios RCP8.5, there are always losses; for RCP2.6 and 4.5,
    there are benefits in 2050 but losses in 2100.
  14: Top grain producers (USA, China, India) suffer the largest losses in tonnes.
    Some countries (Peru, Japan, Korea) benefit in some cases. Some countries benefit
    in RCP8.5 in 2100 (Armenia, Sweden, Latvia) and 2050 (Ecuador, some Eastern Africa
    regions) and RCP2.6 2100 (Sweden, Ireland, Ecuador, some Eastern Africa regions)
  15: Top producers like India and USA face largest losses in grain production, while
    Canada, Germany, and Turkey benefit.
  16: Climate change is simulated to not alter the *overall* global picture of grain
    self-sufficiency, but affects it relatively.
  18: Direct climate change impacts on land productivity are considerable, especially
    for maize; Production effects cancel out most direct climate change impacts; Consumption
    is reduced marginally.
  19: Production effects cancel out around half of the direct climate change impacts;
    Need for more imported grain.
  20: Direct climate change impacts on land productivity are considerable, but production
    effects partially offset these impacts. Grain and wheat consumption are reduced
    significantly.
  21: Production effects cancel out direct climate change impacts on land productivity,
    resulting in relatively stable grain consumption.
  22: All regions benefit from increased grain prices, with high farm income increases
    in USA, China, India, Pakistan.
  23: Global warming reduces grain production; Adaptation significantly reduces losses;
    Russia, China and Indonesia face GDP losses due to increased grain trade costs;
    The CC impact on self-sufficiency may markedly be overestimated without considering
    behavior adjustment of economic agents.
Methodology:
  4: No relevant information
  6: "The analysis uses a production function approach (F(K, \u03C4C) * L\u0304) to\
    \ model grain production, with self-sufficiency ratio calculated as production\
    \ divided by consumption. The change in the ratio is decomposed into contributions\
    \ from capital, climate change, and consumption."
  8: Uses 32 CMIP5 climate models to calculate country-level average climate data;
    Econometric model (Moore et al 2017) calculates climate change impact on crop
    yields; GRACE model estimates economic impacts based on yield changes.
  12: The analysis uses RCP scenarios to project grain production losses. Adaptation
    measures are considered and their impact is quantified by comparing grain loss
    before and after adaptation.
  14: Comparison of grain production under RCP8.5 scenario 2100 with and without adaptation
    strategies. Presents regional reductions in grain production, without specifying
    the underlying model.
  16: Simulation (unspecified)
  19: Uses RCP8.5 scenario projections for 2100 to assess impacts on agriculture.
  21: Simulation of RCP8.5 climate change scenario to 2100. The analysis seems to
    be focused on modeling the impacts of climate change on the production and consumption
    of specific grains.
  23: 'The analysis considers three RCPs: 4.5, 8.5, and 2.6; The analysis considers
    the impact in 2050 and 2100.'
More Notes:
  3: SSR measures food security by considering both production and consumption; Domestic
    production / Domestic consumption
  4: The page focuses on food security as a policy target. It is likely relevant to
    climate adaptation strategies involving agriculture and food systems, as climate
    change can exacerbate the listed risk factors.
  6: The logo indicates the research might be affiliated with or produced by CICERO
    (Center for International Climate Research).
  12: The darker part of each bar represents the loss after adaptation, while the
    entire bar represents the loss before adaptation.
  14: The maps show regional reductions in grain production under temperature change
    in the RCP8.5 scenario in 2100 with and without adaptation. China shows notable
    increases in grain production with adaptation.
  16: The specific simulation methodology is not described, making it difficult to
    assess the robustness of the conclusion that climate change doesn't alter the
    'overall picture'.
  18: Analysis appears to be specific to China under RCP8.5 climate change scenario
    by 2100.
  20: The analysis appears to focus on the agricultural sector in India under a high
    emissions scenario (RCP8.5) by 2100. The analysis focuses on the interplay between
    self-sufficiency rates, productivity impacts of land use, agricultural production,
    and consumption patterns in the grain and wheat sectors.
  21: The negative consumption values in the chart may indicate that the analysis
    calculates consumption as a difference from a baseline or optimal value, rather
    than an absolute quantity. The analysis accounts for both direct impacts on land
    productivity and indirect effects through production and consumption patterns.
    The data presented refers to 'Europe'.
  23: The analysis considers CO2 fertilization.

    precipitation (T&P).

    by 7%, wheat consumption by 9%.
  20: Grain consumption is reduced by 4%, wheat consumption by nearly 10%, grain self-sufficiency
    rate increased slightly (>1% for maize)
  21: Grain self-sufficiency rate increases by 7% overall, mainly due to a nearly
    10% increase in wheat. Direct climate change impacts reduce rice land productivity
    by over 25%.
  22: Maps show percentage changes in farm income and maize prices, highlighted with
    color gradients from 0-5% to over 20% for farm income, and 0-2% to over 8% for
    maize prices.
  23: Losses in grain output could be 25% of current output in RCP8.5 in 2100, but
    less than 5% if producers adapt well; Russia may suffer the most in terms of self-sufficiency
    although USA and India suffer the most in tonnes of output.
