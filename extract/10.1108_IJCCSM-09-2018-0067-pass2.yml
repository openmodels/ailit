Drivers of Risk:
  1: Scarcity of water resources, marginal and predatory use of Caatinga Biome, global
    climate change
  2: Droughts; increasing temperature and reducing rainfall trends; climate change.
  6: Growing water scarcity in the Brazilian semi-arid region due to rainfall deficits
    and potential future rainfall reductions under climate change scenarios.
  8: Lower rainfall impacting hydroelectric reservoir management; Climate change impacting
    water availability for agriculture or household supply.
  9: High cost of PV systems historically; largely mitigated over time.
  10: "Reduction of PV generation costs in Brazil is driven by price drops for PV\
    \ panels in the international market and reductions in Brazil\u2019s Central Bank\
    \ basic interest rate (SELIC)."
  11: Availability of degraded land suitable for distributed PV generation in the
    Brazilian Northeast (NEB) and the economics of solar energy generation in this
    region.
  12: Droughts in the NEB impacting subsistence farming and increasing poverty risk.
  13: Rainfall/season-dependent maize harvest versus daily PV transformation.
  14: Drought, extreme climate events, natural disasters, climate change.
  15: Recurrent droughts impacting maize farmers; degraded and unproductive terrains;
    centralized energy production; semi-arid climate and ongoing climate changes.
Highlights:
  1: Potential of solar radiation abundance (rather than water scarcity) as a global
    adaptation paradigm to climate change; potential to free the region from past
    regional development dogma.
  2: "Exploiting Northeast Brazil\u2019s abundant factors and climate change adaptation,\
    \ especially at the small farmer levels constitutes a discovery never before contemplated;\
    \ distributed PV generation can be a developmental and socioeconomic inclusion\
    \ mechanism."
  6: The paper explores the potentials and challenges for the implementation of regional
    development based on the distributed generation of PV electricity, resulting in
    social inclusion, in the context of growing water scarcity and climate change.
  8: PV generation can complement hydroelectric generation in Brazil, especially during
    periods of lower rainfall, allowing water to be used for other purposes; PV has
    a structuring energy source potential in Brazil's electric grid.
  9: Brazil has ideal conditions for solar energy with high solar irradiation, especially
    in the Northeast, offering potential for distributed PV systems, which can provide
    local employment and energy to remote areas.
  10: Payoff time for initial investments in PV, considering current interest rates
    of 4% per year, would be approximately 7 years in Brazil.
  11: Demonstrates the potential financial benefits of distributed PV energy generation
    in the Brazilian NEB, considering both grid-connected and on-site usage scenarios.
  12: Distributed PV generation can create a network of sustained income for small
    farmer families at risk of extreme poverty during drought years.
  13: PV energy generation has significantly higher economic value per unit area than
    rain-fed maize production in the Brazilian Semiarid Northeast region.
  14: Distributed generation of PV energy presents a relevant opportunity for income
    earnings. A distributed PV program can have multiple advantages in terms of vulnerability
    reduction to extreme climate events, disaster risk reduction and climate change
    adaptation.
  15: PV energy production in the Brazilian Northeast has the potential to be a perennial
    source of income for the historically excluded population, reduce dependence on
    government cash transfers, and regenerate degraded lands.
Methodology:
  1: Scenario building (pre ante design) as an adaptation mechanism in energy generation
    and socioeconomic inclusion.
  2: Details the concept of exploiting the potential for distributed PV generation
    in the NEB, associated with local production of food in its drought resilient
    Caatinga Biome; conceptual paper.
  6: The study estimates PV generation potential using average daily irradiance, energy
    efficiency, and operational efficiency factors. Temporal evolution of cumulative
    rainfall balance is computed using monthly rainfall anomalies relative to the
    1961-1990 climatology. Future rainfall scenarios are based on the Brazilian Earth
    System Model (BESM) under the RCP4.5 radiative forcing scenario.
  8: Compares the potentials of electric energy generated by PV in degraded areas
    and overall hydroelectric potential, normalized by Brazil's 2017 electricity consumption.
  10: Uses information from Instituto Ideal (IDEAL, 2015) of US$2.67/Wp to calculate
    PV system costs; uses residual between average marketed energy value (US$0.071/kWh)
    and value paid to producer for PV plant sizes to estimate payoff time.
  11: Estimates potential revenues from PV plants under passive and active scenarios,
    assuming average solar irradiance values of 6.0 kWh/m2/day, a nominal cell efficiency
    of 20%, and an operational efficiency factor of 70%.
  12: Calculates PV energy potential, multiplies it by PV area and energy market value
    to get gross annual revenue.  Considers income scenarios based on selling energy
    to the grid. Defines PV energy-density value based on electricity production per
    square meter and residential electricity prices. Compares potential PV income
    to the Bolsa Familia program payments. Considers taxes and services from electricity
    commercialization.
  13: Compares output values of PV energy generation and maize production, using average
    maize productivity values for rainy years in the Northeast Brazil (NEB) and applying
    electric energy tariff rates to maize production.
More Notes:
  1: The developments proposed are dependent on federal legislation changes, allowing
    the small producer to be remunerated by the energy produced.
  6: The study focuses on the Northeast Brazil (NEB) region. The analysis considers
    the potential of PV plants to collect rainwater and its impact on water security,
    also factoring in Brazil's interconnected hydroelectric generation system.
  8: The analysis assumes that PV uses commercially available panels and that all
    hydro potential is explored; The PV generation potentials are evaluated on desertified
    areas and degraded planted pastures in the semi-arid region of NEB (Northeast
    Brazil).
  10: Gross annual revenues of energy generation alone (without considering transmission
    costs and taxes) by the PV plants depicted in Table II correspond to 2.74 times
    the interest that would be earned in the financial market given the prevailing
    interest rate of 6.5 per cent per year.
  11: The paper uses data about degraded land (specifically degraded pastures and
    other degraded lands) to estimate the potential for PV generation; the table also
    includes figures for PV panel and system costs, and rates of return.
  12: The analysis focuses on the Northeast Brazil (NEB) region.
  13: The paper acknowledges a caveat that the maize production costs, especially
    transportation, may be underestimated.
  15: The realization of this potential requires changes in legislation, social policies,
    and the recognition of property rights and the role of women.
