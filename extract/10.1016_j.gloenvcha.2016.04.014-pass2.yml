Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate variability (temperature and precipitation), positive temperature extremes,
    positive and negative excess rainfall
  3: Positive anomalies of 5-year averages of maximum temperature in the district;
    negative anomalies of 5-year averages of minimum temperature; both positive and
    negative anomalies of 5-year averages of rainy-season precipitation; soil moisture.
  5: Positive temperature anomalies, negative precipitation anomalies, and soil moisture.
  6: Positive maximum temperature anomalies, negative precipitation anomalies, and
    lower soil moisture affect agricultural employment, which in turn influences migration
    flows.
  7: Climate change impacts on agriculture in South Africa, including precipitation
    and temperature anomalies affecting crop yields.
  8: Increased temperature and decreased rainfall, with increased frequency of high
    temperature extremes
  11: The study identifies economic factors (employment status at destination, differences
    in economic prosperity across provinces) and potentially climatic factors (temperature,
    precipitation, and soil moisture anomalies) as drivers of internal migration.
Highlights:
  1: Increased temperature extremes and excess rainfall at the origin act as a push
    factor and enhance out-migration. The significance of climate on migration varies
    by migrant characteristics; black and low-income South African migrants are strongly
    influenced by climatic variables, whereas white and high-income migrants exhibit
    a weak impact. Agriculture may function as a transmission channel through which
    adverse climatic conditions affect migration.
  3: Distance has a negative impact on migration flow, while contiguity has a positive
    impact. Population, primary education and temperature anomalies are statistically
    significant drivers.
  5: Climatic variables have a more significant and stronger effect on black and low-income
    migrants compared to white and higher-income migrants; higher positive maximum
    temperature anomalies and lower values of soil moisture enhance migration more
    strongly in districts characterized by higher employment in agriculture.
  6: Adverse changes in climate negatively and significantly affect agricultural employment,
    which in turn increases migration flows.
  7: Panel gravity models suggest internal migration flows in South Africa are influenced
    by climate variability.
  11: Gauteng and Western Cape provinces have the largest positive net migration rates,
    while Limpopo and Eastern Cape exhibit a preponderance of emigration. Metropolitan
    municipalities attract a large share of immigrants.
Methodology:
  1: A gravity model is employed where bilateral migration flows are explained by
    climate variability at the origin, along with geographic, socio-economic and demographic
    factors. Analysis focuses on post-apartheid South Africa and uses five-year intervals
    for migration flows.
  3: Panel data analysis using Poisson Pseudo Maximum-Likelihood (PPML) estimates
    with origin and time-destination fixed effects.
  5: PPML panel gravity-model regressions are used to estimate the impact of climatic
    variables on migration flows conditioned on migrant characteristics and agricultural
    importance.
  6: Uses PPML panel gravity model regressions to estimate the impact of climate and
    agriculture on migration flows. Also uses OLS regression to predict agricultural
    employment based on climate variables. Analysis is applicable to post-apartheid
    internal migration in South Africa (1996, 2007).
  7: Econometric specifications using panel gravity models to study internal migration
    flows in South Africa.
  8: Analysis of long-run (1950-2011) averages of precipitation and temperature at
    the South African district council level. Also includes projections based on the
    RCP4.5 scenario for 2081-2100 relative to a 1986-2005 baseline.
  11: The study uses a gravity equation framework with econometric analysis to model
    migration flows, controlling for push and pull factors with fixed effects and
    time-varying covariates. They introduce dyadic climatic variables to assess climatic
    influences on migration.
More Notes:
  1: The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the environment-migration
    link to aid in developing strategies and policies to cope with the challenges
    posed by projected climate change, especially in LDCs.
  3: The analysis controls for lagged demographic and socio-economic factors like
    district population, share of white South Africans, unemployment rate, and educational
    attainment. Climatic variables use 5-year averages and consider both positive
    and negative anomalies.
  5: Migrant income is measured at the destination, which may not fully capture their
    economic status before migration. Results suggest that certain migrant groups
    (e.g., black and low-income) are more vulnerable to climate change and more likely
    to use migration as an adaptation strategy.
  6: The relative impact of climatic variables varies across migrant groups, with
    black and low-income South Africans being affected the most.

    are not explicitly linked to specific climate risks or macroeconomic/fiscal outcomes

  11: The study explores different specifications of push and pull factors in the
    gravity equation, including the use of time-destination dummies, time-origin dummies,
    and dyadic climatic variables.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Migration flows are studied as a human response to climate variation, which can
    indirectly affect income and employment opportunities
  3: Inter-district migration flow of adults (15-64 years old) is the dependent variable.
  5: Migration flows broken down by age classes, gender, marital status, ethnic group,
    and income.
  6: Migration flows within South Africa.
  11: The study examines internal migration patterns within South Africa, which can
    be related to labor market adjustments and potential regional economic disparities
    impacting national GDP and fiscal revenues.
Quantitative material:
  1: The study uses panel data from South African censuses and climatic data for the
    periods 1997-2001 and 2007-2011 to examine the effect of spatiotemporal variability
    in temperature and precipitation on inter-district migration flows.
