Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate and socioeconomic changes
  2: Primary drivers include changes in meteorology, biomass, land use, population
    density, and GDP per capita, with meteorological factors having strong effects
    under higher warming scenarios.
  9: Population increase reduces fire ignitions, except in areas with low historical
    population density where anthropogenic ignition increases with population.
  10: Global warming increases future fire C emissions by changing meteorological
    conditions (fuel dryness) and increasing biomass (fuel load and continuity).
  11: GDP per capita changes, fire suppression leading to fuel continuity, climate
    change increasing fire disturbance.
Highlights:
  1: Sustainable economic development might decrease future fire carbon emissions
  2: Most important finding is the expected decrease in global future fire carbon
    emissions due to increased GDP per capita and enhanced fire management strategies.
  9: GDP per capita has the greatest effect on reducing CCE in African savanna, Southeast
    Asia, west Asia, and some of South America.
  10: Increases in GDP per capita mainly reduced future fire C emissions.
  11: Economic development leading to reduced fire frequency and increased land carbon
    uptake; boreal forests might turn into carbon sources under increased fire disturbance.
Methodology:
  2: 'The analysis considers changes throughout the 21st century by examining five
    key factors: meteorology, biomass, land use, population density, and GDP per capita.'
  9: "Decomposition analysis was performed for nine scenarios, showing cumulative\
    \ fire C emission changes for 2020\u20132099 (Pg C) as compared to the historical\
    \ condition. Factor contributions on CCE were also determined from 2020 to 2099."
  10: The original socioeconomic impact functions (CLMfse) were used to project future
    fire C emissions.
  11: Simulation of fire emissions and impacts on fire spread from different economic
    development scenarios; analysis focused on future projections.
More Notes:
  9: The study considers the impact of meteorology, biomass, land use, population
    density, and GDP per capita on increasing or decreasing fire C emissions under
    different SSP-RCP scenarios.
  10: The biomass contribution on future fire C emissions was small or negative because
    biomass is projected to decrease in some regions.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Fire carbon emissions
  2: The paper suggests future decreases in global fire carbon emissions due to increased
    GDP per capita, indicating improved fire management and capitalized agriculture.
  9: GDP per capita is a powerful factor in reducing fire carbon emissions (CCE).
  10: No relevant information
  11: Increase in GDP per capita could lead to reduced fire occurrence and subsequently
    lower carbon emissions.
Quantitative material:
  2: The paper compares global future fire carbon emissions to historical periods
    (2006-2015) but does not provide specific quantitative figures on this page.
  9: Increases in GDP per capita might reduce CCE by 78.8 (SSP3) to 94.6 (SSP1) Pg
    C over 80 years.
  10: "The decrease in CCE over the 80-year period was 17\u201332 Pg C smaller with\
    \ the CLMfse functions than with the updated model with UFfse."
  11: Net global fire C emissions are projected to decrease, impacting carbon loss
    from ecosystems.
