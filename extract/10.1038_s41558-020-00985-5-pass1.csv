5,Growth rate,76 countries,Observed,2017,No CC,percentage points,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Fig. 3, p. 4","Marginal change is estimated based on regional income levels, and country GDP per capita in 2017 US$. Countries with lower GDP per capita experience larger reductions in growth rates per degree of day-to-day temperature variability, because they tend to experience smaller seasonal temperature differences. This is a placeholder - a precise value is not provided on page 4."
6,Growth rate,76 countries,1979-2018 Observed,2018,No CC,percentage points,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,"Marginal losses from an increase in day-to-day temperature variability are generally larger for regions in low-income nations compared with those in higher-income nations, with the difference being more pronounced in higher-latitude countries"
7,Growth rate,High-income,1979-2018 Observed,2018,No CC,percentage points,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,Marginal losses from an increase in day-to-day temperature variability are generally smaller and show a stronger response to the seasonal temperature difference
8,Growth rate,Low-income,1979-2018 Observed,2018,No CC,percentage points,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,Marginal losses from an increase in day-to-day temperature variability are generally larger
9,Growth rate,76 countries,1979-2018 Observed,2018,No CC,percentage points,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5,The negative impacts of day-to-day variability persist for at least two years following the initial shock. There is evidence of a partial growth recovery in the third year
