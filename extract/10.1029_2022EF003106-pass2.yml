Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in mean climate (long-term trends) and changes in climate variability
    (anomalous weather conditions).
  2: Climate extremes, multivariate or temporally compounding events, long-term trends
    of mean climate, and climate variability.
  3: Changes in climate data (temperature and precipitation) are used as drivers,
    considering different GCMs, SSPs, and RCPs, including SSP1-2.6 (low-emission)
    and SSP5-8.5 (high-emission).
  4: Temperature and precipitation changes during a 3-month season defined by the
    reproductive stage of soybeans (1 month before to 1 month after maturity date).
    Country-specific non-climatic variables (management practices).
  6: The occurrence of 2012-level yield losses is heavily dependent on future climatic
    forcing conditions. Differences in climate sensitivity to increasing CO2 concentrations
    across Global Climate Models (GCMs) also contribute to the variability in projections.
  8: Precipitation and average daily maximum temperature (txm) are drivers of risk.
  9: Hot and dry climatic conditions during the soybean reproductive season; changes
    in both mean climate and climate variability.
  10: Climate variability
  11: Weather extremes, expansion of soybean harvest areas, deforestation in the Amazon,
    and rainfed harvest areas are drivers of risk. Precipitation and temperature anomalies
    influence yields.
  13: The page mentions drivers of risk such as climate extremes (droughts, heatwaves,
    hot-dry compound extremes), changes in temperature, and weather-induced crop failure
    events.
  14: Mentions climate variation, climate change, high temperatures, climate extremes,
    drought, heat waves, water excess, and agriculturally relevant climate extremes
    as drivers impacting crop yields.
Evaluation Overview:
  13: This page focuses on climate change impacts on agriculture, specifically crop
    yields, and associated economic impacts.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Simultaneous soybean failures in the Americas, focusing on events with similar
    or higher impacts than the 2012 event which led to global price increases.
  2: Crop yield variability and crop growth failures, specifically extreme simultaneous
    soybean failures in the Americas.
  3: Simulated and observed soybean yields are analyzed.
  4: "Soybean yield losses, defined as the difference between annual soybean production\
    \ and the mean aggregated production across three countries (Argentina, Brazil,\
    \ and Paraguay) for the 2000\u20132015 period."
  6: Projected soybean yields are evaluated under different climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6
    and SSP5-8.5) with and without adaptation measures.
  8: Soybean yield losses are being evaluated.
  9: Extreme soybean failures in the main production areas (US, Brazil, and Argentina)
    impacting global food security and international markets.
  10: Failures in crop yields in the US, Brazil, and Argentina are evaluated.
  11: Soybean yields and production are evaluated.
  14: This page is a list of references related to climate change impacts, specifically
    focusing on agriculture and food production.
Highlights:
  1: Long-term trends in mean climate increase the frequency and magnitude of simultaneous
    soybean failures, while changes in climate variability increase country-level
    failures but not simultaneous failures.
  2: The study explores how climate change affects extreme simultaneous soybean failures
    in the Americas and assesses the contribution of trends in mean climate and trends
    in climate variability.
  4: The study uses impact analogs of the 2012 drought to assess future risk of soybean
    yield failures in South America.
  6: Without adaptation, the occurrence of 2012 analog events is heavily dependent
    on future climate forcing, with a high occurrence under SSP5-8.5. Adaptation significantly
    reduces the likelihood and magnitude of such events. Trends in mean climate dominate
    the risk of 2012 analogs.
  8: Country-level analogs are more frequent than aggregated analogs in the future.
    The average losses of country-level analogs increase with respect to the historical
    2012 event for all three countries individually. The US shows the highest number
    of country-level analogs. 2012 analogs occur due to one or two countries presenting
    country-level analogs, but no single country dominates the frequency of 2012 analogs.
  9: Long-term effects of climate change increase the frequency and magnitude of yield
    anomalies; adaptation to changes in mean climate can minimize impacts on simultaneous
    soybean failures; 2012 analogs are primarily governed by compounding hot and dry
    conditions.
  10: Failures in the three countries is not expected to significantly increase due
    to changes in climate variability alone.
  11: The study focuses on rainfed harvest areas, and the analysis is limited to soybean
    yields and production. Deforestation is associated with soybean expansion.
  13: The page highlights the impact of climate change on crop yields (wheat, soybean,
    maize), the importance of conserving biomes for protecting the soy economy, and
    the understanding of weather signals in crop-yield variability.
  14: Highlights research on the impact of climate change on global food production,
    US crops, and specific crops like wheat and soybean. Also includes work on crop
    adaptation to climate change through breeding.
Methodology:
  1: A hybrid crop model coupling a process-based crop model with a machine learning
    model to improve the simulation of soybean production.
  2: 'Development of a hybrid model linking weather conditions to crop yields and
    using the concept of impact analogs to identify future events with similar or
    larger impacts than the 2012 event. Two baseline scenarios are considered: one
    with a static current climate baseline and one accounting for trends in mean climate
    and crop yield.'
  3: A hybrid model is built using simulated climate data, simulated yields (from
    GGCM EPIC-IIASA), and observed yields (from USDA, IBGE, MAGYP). Climate indices
    are generated using the R package Climpact. The study uses rainfed soybean harvest
    areas from SPAM2010. Observed data from 1979 to 2015 are used. Future projections
    fix harvest areas to 2012 values.
  4: A hybrid model is developed combining simulated soybean yields from EPIC-IIASA
    and climate indices as predictors in a statistical model (multilayer perceptron)
    calibrated to observed soybean yields. Impact analogs are used to assess the future
    risk of soybean failures, defining years with larger negative anomaly than observed
    in 2012 as the 2012 analogs. Analyzes climatic conditions and spatial distributions
    of analogs. The model is applicable to soybean yields in Argentina, Brazil, and
    Paraguay.
  6: The study investigates the total number of analog events of the 2012 extreme
    weather event (drought) for both adaptation and no adaptation scenarios using
    a hybrid crop model. The hybrid model outputs results that are applicable to projections
    for the future and are more accurate at capturing extreme weather events.
  8: The analysis compares climatic conditions (precipitation and temperature) for
    2012 analogs with the simulated 2012 event using box plots and identifies co-occurrences
    of regional and aggregated soybean failures. Country-level analogs are compared
    with 2012 analogs.
  9: Used climate model simulations driven by future emission scenarios and a hybrid
    model to simulate the effects of climate conditions on yields; adopted an impact
    perspective using extreme crop losses as a starting point.
  10: "The analysis uses Global Gridded Crop Models (GGCMs) (GFDL-esm4, IPSL-cm6a-lr,\
    \ UKESM1-0-ll) and SSPs (1\u20132.6, 5\u20138.5) to model future crop yields."
  11: The study uses soybean harvest areas documented for 2012. It limits its analysis
    to soybean yields and production in rainfed harvest areas based on 2010 data.
    They use country-level analogs to show precipitation and temperature anomalies.
  13: The page includes studies using machine learning with biophysical models, crop
    modeling, global gridded crop models, statistical models, and storylines of weather-induced
    crop failure events.
  14: References studies using crop models, machine learning, and statistical analysis
    to assess climate change impacts on agriculture. Mentions inter-sectoral impact
    model intercomparison projects (ISI-MIP).
More Notes:
  1: Adaptation to long-term mean trends of climate change may reduce the future risk
    of simultaneous soybean losses.
  2: The study area focuses on the US, Brazil, and Argentina, which together are responsible
    for 80% of global soybean production.
  3: The study considers the CO2 fertilization effect on crop growth within the EPIC
    model.
  6: "The GFDL-esm4 model has the lowest climate sensitivity (ECS: 2.6\xB0C), while\
    \ the UKESM1-0-II model has the highest (ECS: 5.3\xB0C)."
  9: The study distinguishes between risk increases due to changes in mean climate
    versus changes in climate variability, noting that these require different adaptation
    responses.
  10: The study emphasizes the importance of joint analysis of crop yield anomalies
    in each of the important growing regions to robustly assess future risk of simultaneous
    soybean failures.
  11: The removal of long-term trends also removes the effects of CO2 fertilization
    in the adaptation scenario.
  13: The page primarily consists of a list of references, which are potentially relevant
    to the U.S. National Climate Assessment. The references span topics including
    the impact of climate change on crop yields, methodologies for assessing these
    impacts, and data resources.
  14: The list covers a range of geographical scales from global to regional (e.g.,
    US Corn Belt, Southern Africa, Brazil). It also covers various aspects of agricultural
    impacts, including crop yields, beer supply, and agricultural practices.
Quantitative Material:
  13: The page lists papers including quantitative information, such as percent changes
    in crop yield and streamflow prediction with climate indices, but the exact quantities
    are only available in the linked articles.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Long-term trends in mean climate increase the frequency of 2012 analogs by 11\u2013\
    16 times and the magnitude by 4\u201315% compared to changes in climate variability\
    \ only depending on the global climate scenario."
  3: "Climate data has daily values at 0.5\xB0 x 0.5\xB0 spatial resolution, spanning\
    \ historical (1901-2015) and projected (2016-2100) periods."
  4: Uses R2, MAE, and RMSE to measure model performance at the grid cell level.  Calculates
    the sum of errors for each model for the 2012 year.
  6: Under SSP5-8.5 without adaptation, 82 annual yield values are at or below the
    2012 yield, with mean production losses 17% larger than the original event. Under
    SSP1-2.6 without adaptation, 43 analogs are observed, and mean production losses
    are 6% larger than the original event. With adaptation, 4 analogs are observed
    under SSP1-2.6 and 5 are observed under SSP5-8.5. Losses are 2.3% and 2.2% larger
    than the 2012 event for the SSP5-8.5 and SSP1-2.6 with adaptation, respectively.
    Without adaptation, 2012 analogs are approximately 11 and 16 times more likely
    to occur than with adaptation for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. The average
    magnitude of analogs is also 4% and 15% higher in the no adaptation scenario than
    in the adaptation for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively.
  8: "Average losses associated with country-level analogs increase by \u22122.7 Mt\
    \ (\u22123.1 Mt, \u22122.2 Mt) in the US, \u22122.5 Mt (\u22123.7 Mt, \u22121.4\
    \ Mt) in Brazil, and \u22122.4 Mt (\u22123.2 Mt, \u22121.6 Mt) in Argentina with\
    \ respect to the corresponding country-level losses observed in 2012."
  9: Risk of 2012 analogs is roughly 11 and 16 times less frequent and on average
    4% and 15% less intense for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively, under adaptation
    scenario.
  10: The figures show occurrences of local analogs and simultaneous analogs to the
    historical event of 2012 for different regions (US, Brazil, Argentina, Americas)
    and decades (2020-2100) under different climate models (GFDL-esm4, IPSL-cm6a-lr,
    and UKESM1-0-ll) and scenarios (SSP 1-2.6 and SSP 5-8.5).
  11: "The figures show precipitation and temperature anomalies (mm and \xB0C, respectively)\
    \ for the US, Brazil, and Argentina, compared to a 2012 event, using box plots."
