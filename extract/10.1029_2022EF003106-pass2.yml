Drivers of Risk:
  1: Simultaneous soybean failures in the Americas mostly driven by changes in mean
    climate and affected by changes in climate variability.
  2: Climate change affecting both long-term trends of mean climate and climate variability,
    with a focus on extreme weather events and temporally compounding events; changes
    in mean climate and climate variability.
  5: Trends in mean climate (long-term changes) and climate variability (short-term
    fluctuations), specifically total monthly precipitation and average daily maximum
    temperature.
  6: Future climatic forcing conditions (specifically CO2 concentration levels and
    climate sensitivity), leading to extreme weather events (analogous to the 2012
    drought).
  7: Climatic conditions, specifically changes in temperature and precipitation patterns;
    Impact analogs of the 2012 drought event.
  9: Climate change, specifically hot and dry climatic conditions during the soybean
    reproductive season and changes in both mean climate and climate variability.
  10: "Changes in climate variability, specifically considering different Global Gridded\
    \ Crop Models (GGCMs) (GFDL-esm4, IPSL-cm6a-lr, UKESM1-0-ll) and SSPs (1\u2013\
    2.6, 5\u20138.5)."
  11: Weather extremes, deforestation, expansion of rainfed harvest areas, CO2 fertilization
    (in the no-adaptation scenario), model/scenario uncertainty.
  12: Long-term mean effects of climate change and climate variability.
Highlights:
  1: Adaptation to the long-term mean trends of climate change may reduce future risk
    of simultaneous soybean losses.
  2: The study aims to determine whether the risk of extreme soybean failures across
    the Americas is changing due to climate change and to disentangle changes in mean
    climate change from changes in climate variability.
  5: The hybrid model outperforms other models in predicting soybean yields, especially
    in capturing extreme events like the 2012 drought. Adding direct climatic information
    to the process-based model enhances performance at the grid cell level, improving
    regionalization. The Stat-clim model performs better than EPIC-IIASA and Stat-EPIC.
  6: Adaptation significantly reduces the frequency and magnitude of future soybean
    yield losses from drought events similar to 2012. 2012 analogs are approximately
    11 and 16 times more likely to occur in the no adaptation scenario than in the
    adaptation scenario for the SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively.
  7: Expected damages associated with 2012 analogs are shown to increase in the US,
    Brazil, and Argentina when compared to the 2012 event.
  9: Long-term effects of climate change significantly increase the frequency and
    magnitude of yield anomalies analogous to the 2012 event. Successful adaptation
    to changes in mean climate can minimize the climate change-caused impacts on simultaneous
    soybean failures. Adaptation scenario analogs are governed by compounding hot
    and dry conditions during the soybean reproductive season.
  10: Joint analysis of crop yield anomalies in important growing regions is necessary
    to robustly assess future risk of simultaneous soybean failures.
  11: Focuses on soybean yields and production under different climate scenarios,
    considering adaptation measures.
  12: The increase of risk of simultaneous extreme soybean losses is primarily driven
    by the long-term mean effects of climate change. Adaptation measures to mean climate
    change can help minimize the increase of risk.
Methodology:
  1: A hybrid crop model combining a process-based crop model with machine learning
    to simulate soybean production under different future climate scenarios.
  2: Development of a hybrid model linking weather conditions to crop yields, adopting
    the concept of impact analogs to identify future events with similar or larger
    impacts than the 2012 soybean failure event; analyzes the contribution of trends
    in mean climate and trends in climate variability separately. Considers scenarios
    with static current climate and trends in mean climate/crop yield.
  5: The study uses several models (EPIC-IIASA, Stat-EPIC, Stat-clim, and a hybrid
    model) to simulate soybean yields under different climate scenarios. It compares
    a 'no adaptation scenario' (future yields relative to present day) with an 'adaptation
    scenario' (future yields relative to future climate baselines). The hybrid model
    was designed to simulate the variability of crop yields and integrates climatic
    data (precipitation and temperature) with process-based model outputs. The models'
    performance is evaluated using out-of-sample data and by simulating the 2012 extreme
    event.
  6: Uses a hybrid model to simulate soybean yields at the grid cell scale. Investigates
    the total number of analog events of the 2012 drought event for both adaptation
    and no adaptation scenarios under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)
    and Global Gridded Crop Models (GGCMs).
  7: "Spatial analysis of nine impact analogs in an adaptation scenario to determine\
    \ losses in each country; assessment of climatic conditions of the impact analogs\
    \ to check for possible changes in the driving climatic anomalies; exploration\
    \ of risks associated with soybean failures in each country for the adaptation\
    \ scenario, using \u201Ccountry-level analogs\u201D."
  9: Uses climate model simulations driven by future emission scenarios and a hybrid
    model to simulate the effects of climate conditions on yields. Employs an impact
    perspective, using extreme crop losses as a starting point.
  10: Analysis using Global Gridded Crop Models (GGCMs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
    (SSPs) to assess the risk of simultaneous soybean failures.
  11: Uses three GCMs with different climate sensitivities and the two most extreme
    SSP scenarios. Simulations use soybean harvest areas documented for the year 2012.
    Analysis focuses on rainfed harvest areas based on data from 2010. Considers the
    effect of adapting sowing dates, migrating planted regions, and genetic modification
    of soybean cultivars.
  12: Simulation and analysis of historic events (e.g., 2012 aggregated crop yield
    failure).
More Notes:
  1: No relevant information
  2: Focuses on US, Brazil, and Argentina, which represent 80% of global soybean production.
    The hybrid models outperform process-based or statistical models alone for impact
    assessment.
  5: The study focuses on soybean yields in specific regions in the Americas. The
    'adaptation scenario' assumes complete agricultural adaptation to changes in mean
    climate.
  6: The paper focuses on soybean production in the US, Brazil, and Argentina.
  7: The impact analogs show a significant variability in climatic conditions, highlighting
    different ways extreme impacts result from anomalous weather conditions. The number
    of country-level analogs of the 2012 event is 3.4, 4.4, and 9.3 times higher for
    Argentina (31), Brazil (40).
  9: The study distinguishes between increased risk due to changes in mean climate
    and increased risk due to changes in climate variability, suggesting different
    adaptation responses are required.
  10: The study assumes adaptation of crop management practices to mean climate trends.
  11: Sampling uncertainty in extreme events can be addressed by using large ensembles.
    Model or scenario uncertainty can be further explored by adopting a larger set
    of GCMs and SSPs. The effects of CO2 fertilization are considered only for the
    no adaptation scenario. The expansion of soybeans is a significant matter, as
    deforestation in the Amazon has been associated with soybean expansion, and preserving
    natural vegetation helps protecting soybeans from weather extremes. Expansion
    of irrigation areas in subsequent years could lead to changes in the sensitivity
    of the studied area to weather variability.
  12: Dedicated analysis techniques are needed to assess climate impacts and adaptation
    responses. The difference in impacts due to changes in mean climate and changes
    in climate variability is large, influencing potential adaptation options.

Quantitative material:
  1: "Findings indicate an increase in the frequency of events similar to 2012 by\
    \ 11\u201316 times and the magnitude by 4\u201315% depending on the global climate\
    \ scenario."
  2: The study analyzes potential changes in analog frequency and magnitude of soybean
    failures.
  5: Table 1 presents out-of-sample performance metrics (R^2, MAE, RMSE) for different
    models predicting soybean yields. For example, the Stat-clim model has an R^2
    of 0.66, MAE of 0.245 ton/ha, and RMSE of 0.334 ton/ha. The hybrid model achieves
    the lowest absolute error for the 2012 event relative to other models. The color
    bar on the maps indicates yield anomalies ranging from -1.0 to 1.0 ton/ha.
  6: In the no adaptation scenario, SSP5-8.5 estimates 82 annual yield values at or
    below the 2012 yield. For SSP1-2.6, 43 analogs are observed. Mean production losses
    are 17% larger than the original event for the SSP5-8.5 and 6% for the SSP1-2.6.
    The adaptation scenario shows nine analogs in total (4 for SSP1-2.6 and 5 for
    SSP5-8.5). The SSP5-8.5 and SSP1-2.6 mean losses are 2.3% and 2.2% larger than
    the 2012 event, respectively.
  7: "When compared to the 2012 event, analogs losses in the US, Brazil and Argentina\
    \ increase on average (in brackets the 95% confidence interval) by \u22121.5 Mt\
    \ (\u22124.1 Mt, 1.0 Mt), \u22120.5 Mt (\u22125.9 Mt, 4.8 Mt), \u22120.6 Mt (\u2212\
    4.0 Mt, 2.8 Mt), respectively."
  9: The bar graph indicates production anomalies in Megatonnes for US, Brazil, and
    Argentina related to country-level analogues, with values around or below -2.0
    Megatonnes. The adaptation scenario reduces the risk of 2012 analogs by roughly
    11 and 16 times less frequent and on average 4% and 15% less intense for SSP1-2.6
    and SSP5-8.5, respectively.
