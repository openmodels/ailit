Drivers of Risk:
  2: High temperatures, particularly in rainfed conditions leading to water stress.
  4: High temperatures and water stress are identified as key drivers of crop yield
    declines.
  5: High temperatures negatively impact rainfed maize and soybean yields.
  9: "Temperature shifts, specifically exposure to temperatures above 30\xB0C and\
    \ extreme high temperatures above 36\xB0C."
Highlights:
  2: Crop models reproduce observed temperature responses; high temperatures diminish
    maize and soybean yields significantly under rainfed conditions; irrigation can
    offset yield losses better than elevated CO2.
  4: Current models can reliably assess crop losses induced by high temperatures;
    water stress is a major cause of yield declines; elevated CO2 cannot be confirmed
    as a safeguard of yields under high temperatures.
  5: Elevated CO2 only limitedly attenuates yield loss in rainfed conditions. Irrigation
    can reduce the decline in yields at high temperatures, but with larger confidence
    intervals.
  9: "Splits the temperature distribution into three parts to assess the impact of\
    \ each: no stress (>30\xB0C), medium high (30-36\xB0C), and extreme high (>36\xB0\
    C)."
Methodology:
  2: Ensemble of nine crop models compared to observed temperature responses of US
    maize, soybean, and wheat yields.
  4: The analysis uses Global Gridded Crop Models (GGCMs) to simulate crop yields
    under different temperature and water conditions; statistical models estimate
    yield changes based on exposure to different temperatures; the models are validated
    against observed yield data.
  5: Panel regression is applied to simulated future yields in rainfed counties under
    climate change (RCP 8.5) using an ensemble of six GGCMs.
  9: Uses a statistical model that adjusts for county-specific fixed effects, linear
    and quadratic variations in precipitation, and state-specific time trends to estimate
    yield based on the cumulative distribution function of days during the growing
    season spent at different temperatures. Spatially correlated error terms are included.
    The relative contribution to yield for each temperature part is calculated. The
    model is applied to historical observed rainfed maize, soybean, and wheat yields.
More Notes:
  2: Wheat is less affected under historical conditions as critical temperatures are
    rarely exceeded during the growing season, but is projected to decline in the
    future.
  4: The study focuses on maize, soybean, and wheat; the results are specific to rainfed
    crops, with irrigation shown to mitigate some of the negative effects of high
    temperatures; the models include relevant mechanisms of high-temperature-induced
    yield loss under current climate.
  5: The study analyzes the impact of temperature, water, and CO2 interaction on future
    yields under global warming.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Crop yield reductions in US maize, soybean, and wheat.
  4: Crop yield loss is the primary outcome of interest.
  5: Rainfed yields of maize, soybean, and wheat are projected to decline under climate
    change (RCP 8.5).
  9: Yield losses in maize, soybean and wheat crops due to temperature shifts.
Quantitative material:
  2: "Each day >30\xB0C diminishes maize and soybean yields by up to 6% under rainfed\
    \ conditions."
  4: "An additional day at temperatures between 33 and 36 \xB0C reduces maize yield\
    \ by approximately 4%."
  5: The average decline in growing season length per degree Celsius increase is B7.4
    days for rainfed maize, 5.6 days for soybean, and 1.3 days for wheat.
  9: "Presents an equation (equation 2) to calculate yield loss based on fitted coefficients\
    \ and historical/future exposure time for each 3\xB0C bin, separated into no stress,\
    \ medium high temperature, and extreme high temperature."
