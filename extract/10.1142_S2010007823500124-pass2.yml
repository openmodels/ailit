Drivers of Risk:
  4: No relevant information
  12: Increased average maximum seasonal temperature and changes in average accumulated
    seasonal rainfall due to climate change.
  15: Main drivers of risk include temperature rise, reduction in average rainfall,
    increased occurrence of droughts, and more frequent extreme weather events such
    as heatwaves and forest fires.
  16: Climate change impacts on agriculture, particularly reduced productivity and
    viability of certain crops.
  17: Declining agricultural productivity due to climate change.
  19: Climate change impacts, specifically under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
  20: Increased average temperature.
  21: Difficulty for family farming to invest in technological innovations, low access
    to technical assistance, rural extension services, agricultural credit for investment,
    and climate information.
  22: Climate change (temperature increases, altered rainfall patterns, drought episodes,
    water stress).
  23: Extreme events, such as very high temperatures, floods, droughts, and periods
    of too low-level water, have become more frequent and intense in the Amazon in
    recent decades, causing various types of losses to the fauna, flora, population,
    and local infrastructure; along with climate change, other problems faced by Amazonian
    communities are deforestation and forest degradation.
  24: Climate changes (drought, rainfall irregularity, high temperatures, extreme
    heat, deforestation, variations in historical patterns of temperature and rainfall,
    extreme climate events); Water (un)availability, difficulty and poor distribution
    of water access.
  25: Climate change leading to reduced rainfall, increased drought frequency and
    intensity, and desertification. Increased temperature and drought tendency intensify
    aridity in semiarid regions.
  32: Temperature rise, rainfall reduction, longer and more frequent heat waves and
    droughts, increased risks of forest fires and floods, increased desertification,
    higher risk of savannization of the Amazon rainforest.
  33: Extreme weather conditions (droughts, floods, intense climate events) affecting
    crops and agricultural production in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil.
    Limited access to public policies and financing for climate change adaptation
    practices.
Highlights:
  4: No relevant information
  12: Clear visual trend showing a significant increase in seasonal maximum temperatures
    over time, with the intensity of heat increasing notably from the 1986-2014 period
    to the 2075-2100 period; Noticeable differences in rainfall distribution between
    seasons and over the decades, with a trend towards changing rainfall patterns
    from past to future periods.
  15: Climate change impacts can lead to reduced water and food security, health problems,
    and compromised socioeconomic and human development in the North and Northeast
    regions.
  16: Climate change is likely to exacerbate regional economic disparities in Brazil,
    negatively impacting the North and Northeast while the South may benefit.
  17: Losses will be greater for regions whose economies are more dependent on agriculture.
    Poor workers and low-income groups more dependent on agriculture will have more
    expressive well-being losses, mainly in the Northeast and Midwest.
  18: Farmers with lower productivity are more vulnerable to climate change. Productivity
    losses are greater in family farming than in large-scale agriculture. Some crops
    important for family farmers will have great productivity losses (cassava, beans,
    banana, and maize).
  19: The page provides projected percentage changes in family farming and commercial
    agriculture productivity for various states in Northern and Northeastern Brazil
    under different climate change scenarios.
  20: The lower the levels of agricultural productivity, the more significant are
    the negative effects of climate change.
  21: Family farming in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil has lower productivity
    than large-scale agriculture, leading to a technological gap and increased vulnerability
    to climate change. Key barriers to adopting technological innovations include
    low access to technical assistance, agricultural credit, and climate information.
    A significant percentage of producers cannot read or write, further hindering
    technological adoption.
  22: Climate change is expected to significantly reduce the productivity of key crops
    like cassava, maize, and beans, impacting food security for family farmers in
    the North and Northeast of Brazil. Losses can be substantial, potentially ranging
    from 75% to 92% for maize and 69% to 88% for beans in some regions.  Livestock
    productivity is also negatively affected, especially for poorer farmers.  Access
    to climate information and understanding traditional knowledge are crucial for
    adaptation.
  23: Climate change, deforestation, and forest degradation lead to food insecurity,
    malnutrition, health problems, conflict, violence, disorganization of collective
    work, and isolation of communities in the Amazon biome.
  24: Climate change can lead to rural-to-urban migration, exacerbating socioeconomic
    problems in cities. Water scarcity is a key driver of vulnerability for family
    farmers in the Brazilian semiarid region.
  25: Climate change can compromise agricultural activities, mainly those of family
    farmers, and disrupt local and regional food markets. Farmers affected by climate
    change may be unable to migrate due to poverty, leading to persistent poverty
    in rural areas.
  32: Climate change will have direct effects on local agricultural production, food
    security, rural poverty, and pressure on natural resources, leading to biodiversity
    loss and increased migration.
  33: Climate change threatens sustainable development in Brazil by impacting poverty
    reduction, living conditions, economic gains, and environmental conservation,
    particularly for family farmers and vulnerable groups like indigenous peoples,
    quilombolas, riverine communities, and women. Improving the responsiveness of
    family farmers is crucial.

More Notes:
  4: This page contains a description of the paper's bibliographic information, authors,
    project sponsorship, and funding details but lacks specific content or data related
    to the macroeconomic and macro-fiscal analysis of climate change.
  16: The analysis focuses on the differential impacts across Brazilian regions and
    highlights the vulnerability of family farming, particularly in the North and
    Northeast.
  17: "States Mato Grosso, Tocantins, Par\xE1 and Maranh\xE3o could have the largest\
    \ GDP declines resulting from agricultural losses caused by climate change by\
    \ 2050 (according to Amazon, Tanure et al. 2020)."
  18: "Focuses on Brazil as a whole, particularly the regions North and Northeast.\
    \ The most affected states are in the North (Amap\xE1, Roraima and Par\xE1) and\
    \ Northeast (Sergipe, Alagoas, Bahia and Pernambuco)."
  19: The information is presented visually with Figure 12 representing the Northern
    states and Figure 13 the Northeastern states, although the actual data from the
    graphs is not included on this page. The presented data is disaggregated by state
    and by type of agriculture (family vs. commercial).
  20: The analysis disaggregates results for different categories of land values and
    productivity levels (with no separation by crops).
  21: The paper highlights the importance of technological absorption for productivity
    dynamics and the reproduction of inequality. The difficulties faced by family
    farmers in accessing innovation exacerbate these issues.
  22: The page focuses on regional impacts within Brazil rather than national-level
    macroeconomic or fiscal effects directly.  The ultimate impacts on GDP or government
    finances are implied but not quantified on this page.
  24: The study focuses on the Brazilian semiarid region and the impact of climate
    change on family farmers and subsequent migration patterns.
  32: Family farmers have lower adaptive capacity due to low income, dependence on
    agriculture, and limited access to climate predictions and information.
  33: The paper emphasizes the importance of sustainable agricultural techniques,
    crop diversification, soil management, access to climate information, cooperation
    networks, and supportive public policies for climate change adaptation. It also
    highlights the gendered impacts of climate change, with women facing additional
    vulnerabilities due to discrimination and their roles in the family and community.
