Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate, environment, and socio-economic drivers
  3: Long-term and short-term climatic factors; Natural production environment; Increased
    climate variability
  4: Declining agricultural productivity, cereal crop failure, increasing anomalies
    in climate and weather events, and other environmental factors.
  5: Climate change (rainfall, temperature), natural production environment, socio-economic
    factors
  6: Climate variability, trade barriers, waste management in agriculture.
  7: The analysis considers changes in Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and its components
    which are influenced by different explanatory variables.
  9: Long-term precipitation (LTP), Rainfall variability, Long-term mean temperature
    (LTT), Temperature variability, Regional dummy (related to geography)
  11: Rainfall variability, LTT (Long-Term Temperature), Temperature variability,
    Land elevation, Arid and semiarid climate, Tropical and subtropical climate
  12: Climate-related variables including long-term temperature and rainfall averages,
    and annual variations in temperature and precipitation contribute to efficiency
    and productivity risks.
  13: Climate variability (changes in annual rainfall, temperature, length of the
    wet season, length of the transition time).
  14: Climate variables (precipitation, temperature, rainfall variability), land elevation,
    weather regime, and regional differences influence TFP and its efficiency components.
  16: Increasing temperature and volatility in climatic variables.
  17: Climate change, climate variability, weather fluctuations, agricultural policies,
    warming of the Indian Ocean
Highlights:
  3: Global agricultural productivity grew consistently at a rate of 0.44% p.a., driven
    by technological progress and mix-efficiency change; climatic factors significantly
    reduce global agricultural productivity; Increased climate variability will significantly
    reduce future agricultural productivity.
  4: Agricultural productivity growth is a critical long-term strategy to address
    poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, with implications for achieving sustainable
    development goals.
  5: Existing literature lacks a holistic approach exploring the combined impacts
    of climate change, production environment, and socio-economic factors on agricultural
    productivity. Many studies focus solely on climatic variables or technology/human
    capital, leading to potential omitted variable bias. The present study aims to
    address these gaps.
  6: Established linkages amongst climate, production environment, and socio-economic
    factors with global agricultural productivity. Identified synergies amongst agricultural
    productivity and various efficiency components. Provided the magnitude and direction
    of agricultural TFP change from future climate variabilities.
  9: Global agricultural TFP grew annually at a rate of 0.44%.
  11: Rainfall variability and temperature (both long-term and variability) negatively
    and significantly impact TFP change and its components. Land elevation has a complex,
    non-linear relationship with TFP and its components. Climate zone also matters.
  12: Increasing mean temperature and rainfall variability generally have negative
    effects on agricultural productivity and efficiency.
  13: Climate variability is predicted to reduce TFP growth in agriculture compared
    to a scenario with no additional climate variabilities. The arid and semiarid
    regions performed worst. The likelihood of TFP growth is higher in tropical and
    subtropical zones compared to the temperate zone.
  14: Increasing temperature and rainfall variability negatively impact agricultural
    TFP growth. Agricultural spending on R&D positively influences TFP growth. Climate
    change is likely to have a significant growth-reducing role in agricultural TFP
    despite past growth patterns.
  16: Country and region-specific research and policies to mitigate and adapt to climate
    change should have top-most priority due to regional variations in TFP performance.
  17: Climate change impacts agricultural productivity and food security. Some studies
    investigate the economic impacts of climate change on specific countries' agriculture.
Methodology:
  1: The paper analyzes the drivers of global agricultural productivity growth.
  3: "Panel data of 104 countries, covering a 45-year period (1969\u20132013); F\xE4\
    re\u2013Primont TFP index; Multivariate Tobit model"
  4: Examining TFP (total factor productivity) change, which allows decomposition
    of total production growth into components such as technology, efficiency, and
    scale changes.
  5: The study uses TFP and efficiency estimates of Anik et al. [45], which are based
    on a panel data of 104 countries. The study aims to jointly identify the influences
    of climate change, natural production environment, and socio-economic factors
    on global agricultural productivity growth.
  6: "Uses O\u2019Donnell\u2019s F\xE4re\u2013Primont index (FPI) approach applied\
    \ by Anik et al. [45] to estimate TFP and its components. The methodology uses\
    \ FAOSTAT data and requires specification of the production technology (i.e.,\
    \ output and/or input distance functions)."
  7: The analysis is performed using a multivariate Tobit model (MVTOBIT) to identify
    determinants of TFP and its components, with predictions under different climatic
    scenarios using STATA 16 software.
  9: 30-year moving average for long-term climate variables, Logarithmic transformation
    of precipitation and temperature data, Use of regional dummies, MVTOBIT model
    to estimate determinants of TFP change and its components.
  11: MVTOBIT (Multivariate Tobit) model to estimate the determinants of TFP change
    and its components (Technical, Scale, and Mix-Efficiency).
  13: A multivariate Tobit (MVTOBIT) model is used to predict TFP up to 2033 under
    four different climatic scenarios. The model uses parameter estimates derived
    from historical data (1969-2013) to project future TFP. Countries are classified
    into temperate, tropical/subtropical, and arid/semiarid regions.
  14: Econometric analysis is used to assess the impact of production environment
    (land elevation, weather regime) and regional dummies on TFP and its efficiency
    components. The model incorporates climatic variables and agricultural spending
    for R&D.
  17: Multi-market model approach, panel data analysis, parametric approach, econometric
    analysis
More Notes:
  3: Policy implications include investments in crop diversification, education, agricultural
    spending, number of researchers, and country specific R&D.
  5: The page critiques existing TFP measures used in other studies for being biased
    and lacking features of multiplicative completeness or transitivity, limiting
    the ability to decompose TFP growth into finer components of associated efficiency
    measures.
  6: The study acknowledges the importance of waste management (circular economy)
    and agricultural trade in TFP growth but couldn't explore them due to data limitations.
  9: Analysis focuses on global agricultural productivity. Positive and significant
    correlations exist amongst TFP and its efficiency components.
  11: The table includes a range of variables including technology enhancing variables,
    institutional capacity variables, socio-economic variables, production environment
    and weather regime dummies and regional dummies.
  12: The paper discusses the impact of education, economic openness, and agricultural
    spending on productivity, with mixed outcomes.
  13: The analysis focuses on agriculture and does not directly address broader macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes. The analysis is global but does not explicitly assess national-level
    adaptation costs and benefits. The estimated TFP growth rate was modest, but remained
    positive over a long period. Technical and scale efficiencies performed well,
    but mix efficiency did not.
  14: Farming is sensitive to topography because climate variables are related to
    elevation and extreme topography. Regional differences significantly influence
    changes in TFP and its efficiency components.
  16: The page emphasizes the importance of climate-smart agricultural technologies,
    crop insurance, and efficient fertilizer use. It also highlights the need for
    involvement from governments, international donors, the private sector, and individual
    farmers in adaptation efforts.
  17: The page focuses heavily on the agricultural sector and its vulnerability to
    climate change, highlighting the importance of adaptation in maintaining productivity
    and food security.

    0.97; Mix-efficiency level at 0.78; Residual scale efficiency level at 0.37; Residual
    mix-efficiency level at 0.29. Geometric mean of TFP change index for the last
    four and a half decades was 1.014.
  11: Table 4 presents a quantitative analysis of the determinants of TFP change and
    its components using a MVTOBIT model, with coefficients indicating the marginal
    effects of various variables on the different efficiency indices. Significance
    levels (1%, 5%, 10%) are indicated by ***, **, and * respectively.
  12: A 1% increase in long-term precipitation (LTP) is associated with a 0.021% reduction
    in technical efficiency and a 0.004% increase in scale-efficiency; a 1% increase
    in long-term temperature (LTT) is associated with a likelihood of 0.056% decrease
    in TFP.
  13: Predicted TFP index changes under different climate scenarios for 2033 relative
    to a baseline year of 2013 are presented in Table 5. These show a positive TFP
    growth but that additional climate variabilities reduce this growth compared to
    a counterfactual scenario.
  14: Table 3 contains TFP change index values for countries located at medium elevation
    level. Table 4 contains the econometric analysis demonstrating the growth reducing
    role for both temperature and rainfall variabilities. Table 5 presents the forecasted
    TFP under different climatic scenarios.
