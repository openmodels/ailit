Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate, environment and socio-economic drivers
  3: Long-term and short-term climatic factors and the natural production environment
  4: Increasing anomalies in climate, weather events, and declining agricultural productivity
    threaten agricultural sustainability.
  5: The paper explores the influence of climate change, the natural production environment,
    and socio-economic factors on global agricultural productivity.
  7: The study predicts future TFP changes under different climatic scenarios.
  9: Long-term precipitation (LTP), rainfall variability, long-term mean temperature
    (LTT), and temperature variability are used as climate variables.
  11: The climatic variables included as drivers of risk are Long-Term Precipitation
    (LTP), Rainfall Variability, Long-Term Temperature (LTT), and Temperature Variability.
  13: Climate variabilities (annual rainfall, temperature) and changes in long-term
    precipitation (LTP) and long-term temperature (LTT) are considered as drivers
    of risk.
  14: Pest and disease infestations vary according to seasonal variations in weather
    parameters, impacting agriculture.
  16: Increasing temperature and volatility in climatic variables are identified as
    adverse factors affecting TFP growth in agriculture.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Global agricultural productivity growth
  3: Global agricultural total factor productivity (TFP)
  4: Focuses on the need for sustainable intensification in agriculture to increase
    productivity without compromising ecosystem services.
  5: This paper focuses on agricultural productivity and efficiency, particularly
    total factor productivity (TFP).
  7: This study evaluates agricultural Total Factor Productivity (TFP) change.
  9: Evaluates global agricultural total factor productivity (TFP) change and its
    components (technical, scale, and mix efficiency).
  11: This paper evaluates the determinants of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) change
    in agriculture and its components (technical efficiency, scale efficiency, and
    mix-efficiency).
  13: This paper evaluates Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in agriculture as an outcome.
  14: The growth-reducing role of increasing temperature and rainfall variability
    on agricultural TFP is discussed.
  16: The paper discusses the impact of increasing temperature and volatility in climatic
    variables on Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth in agriculture.
Highlights:
  3: Increased level of future climate variability will significantly reduce future
    agricultural productivity.
  4: Emphasizes the critical role of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth in agriculture
    to tackle poverty, hunger, malnutrition, and achieve sustainable development goals.
  9: Global agricultural TFP grew annually at a rate of 0.44%. Complementary relationships
    exist amongst TFP and its components.
  11: Rainfall and temperature variability have significant negative impacts on TFP
    change. Land elevation and being in arid, semiarid, tropical, and subtropical
    zones have significant positive impacts on TFP change.
  13: Predicted TFP in 2033 is significantly higher compared to 2013 under all scenarios,
    but increases more in the absence of additional climate variabilities. Additional
    climate variabilities significantly reduce TFP from its natural rate of change.
  14: Research and development spending is critical, yet there has been a relatively
    low global allocation to this sector.
  16: The importance of country and region-specific research and policies to mitigate
    and adapt to climate change is emphasized.
Methodology:
  1: The paper is published in the journal Land, Volume 11, Issue 4, article 512,
    in 2022.
  3: "Panel data of 104 countries, covering a 45-year period (1969\u20132013)"
  5: The study uses TFP and efficiency estimates from Anik et al. [45], based on a
    panel data of 104 countries. The study aims to identify the influences of climate
    change, natural production environment, and socio-economic factors on global agricultural
    productivity growth and its finer components (i.e., technical-, scale-, and mix-efficiency
    changes); and (b) predict the effect of future climate variabilities on global
    agricultural productivity.
  7: A multivariate Tobit model (MVTOBIT) is applied to identify the determinants/drivers
    jointly influencing agricultural TFP and its efficiency components. Future TFP
    is predicted using parameter estimates from the MVTOBIT model and forecasting
    explanatory variables. The model uses data from 1969-2013 to predict out to 2033.
  9: A 30-year moving average is used to calculate long-term climate variables. A
    multivariate tobit model (MVTOBIT) is applied to estimate the determinants of
    TFP change and its efficiency components. The time period covered appears to be
    1969 onwards.
  11: The analysis uses a Multivariate Tobit (MVTOBIT) model. The note indicates significance
    levels at 1%, 5%, and 10%.
  13: A MVTOBIT model is used to predict TFP up to 2033 under four different climatic
    scenarios. The baseline year for comparison is 2013, with data extending back
    to 1969 in some cases.
  14: Econometric analysis is used to confirm the growth-reducing role of both temperature
    and rainfall variabilities on TFP.

    Africa, South Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, East Asia and the Pacific,
    and Europe and Central Asia, relative to Middle East and North Africa.
  13: The analysis classifies countries into three categories based on weather regime
    (arid/semiarid, temperate, and tropical/subtropical). The arid/semiarid region
    performed the worst.
  14: There are notable regional differences in TFP changes, with MENA having a relatively
    lower TFP change rate compared to other regions.
  16: The adoption of climate-smart agricultural technologies faces socio-economic,
    political, and institutional constraints.

Quantitative material:
  3: Global agricultural productivity grew consistently at a rate of 0.44% p.a.
  7: The study predicts changes in global agricultural TFP up to 2033.
  9: Global TFP grew annually at a rate of 0.44%. Geometric means and growth rates
    are provided for TFP and its components.  The geometric mean of the TFP change
    index for the last four and a half decades was 1.014.
  11: The table provides marginal effects of various factors on TFP change and its
    components, including the effects of climatic variables. For example, a 1-unit
    increase in rainfall variability is associated with a -0.139 change in the TFP
    change index (significant at the 1% level). Similarly, a 1-unit increase in LTT
    is associated with a -0.056 change in the TFP change index (significant at the
    1% level).
  13: Predicted TFP change index in 2033 is 1.102 under a counterfactual model (no
    additional climate variabilities) and ranges from 1.098 to 1.102 under other climate
    scenarios. The percentage change in TFP from 2013 to 2033 is around +6% under
    different scenarios. The mean difference in TFP between the counterfactual model
    and other models ranges from -0.009 to -0.440.
  14: Agricultural TFP is forecasted to increase in the future, but any additional
    climate changes are likely to have a significant growth-reducing role.
