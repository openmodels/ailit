Drivers of Risk:
  3: Trends in grassland coverage driven by precipitation trends, temperature-driven
    evaporation, and changes in precipitation frequency and intensity.
  5: Future climate change impacting North American grassland growth and productivity,
    changes in timing and magnitude of grassland growth.
  8: No relevant information
Highlights:
  3: Regional patterns of grassland coverage change are typically influenced by precipitation
    trends and combined effects of temperature-driven evaporation and precipitation
    changes.
  5: Widespread changes in both the timing and magnitude of North American grassland
    growth and productivity in response to future climate change with significant
    gains in grassland fCover and growing season length, having large implications
    for agricultural productivity.
  8: No relevant information
Methodology:
  3: Analysis performed using ensemble mean of ten CMIP5 climate projections for changes
    in grassland coverage from the start to the end of the 21st century.
  8: No relevant information
More Notes:
  8: This page is a corrigendum addressing a mathematical error in an equation related
    to vegetation availability in a study about North American grasslands. It does
    not contain information relevant to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks of climate
    change or the costs and benefits of adaptation at a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  5: Agricultural productivity
  8: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  5: "Projections indicate significant gains (18\xB114/9%) in grassland fCover by\
    \ 2100 across more than half of the region that is dominated by grasslands at\
    \ present; substantial increases in growing season length (by ~5 weeks) across\
    \ much of this biome."
