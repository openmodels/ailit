Drivers of Risk:
  1: Anthropogenic climate change (ACC) affecting temperature and precipitation patterns
  2: Temperature and Precipitation (climate change)
  3: Changes in green-season average temperature (T) and precipitation (P)
  4: Warmer temperatures over the green season are detrimental to TFP growth. Precipitation
    has a non-linear relationship with TFP growth, peaking at around 500 mm over the
    green season.
  5: Anthropogenic Climate Change (ACC) and temperature changes (Tmax, Tmean, Tmin)
  6: Anthropogenic climate change (ACC).
  7: Climate change; Weather.
  8: Historical weather data (temperature and precipitation), and counterfactual weather
    trajectories from climate model simulations (CMIP6 'hist-nat' and 'historical'
    experiments, complemented by SSP2-4.5 for 2015-2020).
  9: Changes in weather variables, specifically temperature (Tmax, Tmin, or Tmean)
    and precipitation, driven by accelerated climate change (ACC).
  15: Changes in green-season average temperature (T) and total precipitation (P).
  17: Changes in green-season average temperature (T) and green-season total precipitation
    (P)
  19: Changes in green-season average Temperature (T) and total Precipitation (P)
  25: Changes in green-season average temperature (T) and green-season total precipitation
    (P) are the drivers of risk.
  27: Changes in green-season average temperature (T) and total precipitation (P)
    are the drivers of risk being analyzed.
  28: Anthropogenic climate change (ACC).
Highlights:
  1: Warmer regions have experienced more severe reductions in agricultural TFP.
  2: Average agricultural TFP has more than doubled since 1961 but there is wide cross-country
    variation.
  3: There is a robust relationship between agricultural TFP growth and weather changes.
  4: ACC has significantly reduced global agricultural TFP growth between 1961 and
    2020.
  5: Anthropogenic climate change has a negative impact on global average TFP; the
    impacts vary significantly by region, with warmer regions experiencing larger
    negative impacts; ignoring input responses (analyzing output instead of TFP) makes
    the global impacts of ACC appear more severe; global agriculture is growing increasingly
    sensitive to ongoing climate change.
  6: ACC is increasingly reducing agricultural output as we drift away from a climate
    system without human influences, cumulating into a detectable and sizeable impact
    as of 2020.
  7: Anthropogenic climate change has slowed global agricultural productivity growth
    (Ortiz-Bobea et al., 2021). Growing climatic sensitivity of US agriculture is
    linked to technological change and regional specialization (Ortiz-Bobea, Knippenberg,
    & Chambers, 2018). Weather, climate, and total factor productivity are linked
    (Letta, M. & Tol, R. S. J., 2019).
  8: The paper aims to derive the effect of anthropogenic climate change on global
    agricultural TFP by modelling the relationship between weather variables and TFP
    growth.
  9: The study finds that variations in model specification (e.g., using revenue regression
    weights or a 'green season' for weather aggregation) can lead to larger damage
    estimates. The analysis suggests smaller countries may be less sensitive to weather
    changes.
  15: The study explores the relationship between agricultural productivity and green-season
    temperature and precipitation without the hottest 10% of countries.
  17: The paper analyzes the response of agricultural productivity (measured by TFP)
    to changes in temperature and precipitation during the growing season.
  19: "The response function of TFP to temperature changes is shown, centered so that\
    \ the exposure-weighted marginal effect is zero. A baseline response function\
    \ for 1962\u20132015 is also shown. Country-level distribution of green-season\
    \ average temperature is shown."
  25: The paper shows how changes in green-season temperature and precipitation impact
    country-level TFP. The response functions are centered to show the marginal effect.
    Placebo checks are performed to confirm statistical significance.
  27: Agricultural productivity (as measured by TFP) responds to changes in green-season
    temperature and precipitation.
  28: Global impact estimates for 298 model variations are shown, with confidence
    intervals.
Methodology:
  1: Block bootstrap with 500 repetitions to account for parameter uncertainty.
  3: Analysis uses data from 1962-2015. Response functions are centred vertically
    so that the exposure-weighted marginal effect is zero. Confidence bands are based
    on 500 year-by-region block bootstraps. Placebo checks are performed by randomly
    mismatching TFP and weather data or reshuffling by years or country.
  4: Econometric estimates are linked with counterfactual weather trajectories from
    climate experiments (CMIP6) with and without ACC to derive the cumulative impact
    of ACC for each country since 1961. Placebo checks by reshuffling year and country
    data are performed.
  5: Econometric models with various specifications (quadratic/cubic functional forms,
    different weighting schemes, growing season definitions, heterogeneity assumptions);
    tenfold cross-validation to assess model fit; analyzed data from 1961 onwards;
    Models with different weights based on how well they fit the data.
  6: Econometric analysis considering climate, econometric, and specification uncertainty.
  7: The papers referenced cover productivity analysis, total factor productivity
    estimation, and determining climate effects on agricultural productivity.
  8: The paper uses econometric models to relate TFP growth to weather variables,
    controlling for country and year fixed effects. A bias-corrected spatial disaggregation
    (BCSD) approach is used to downscale climate model data. The baseline model regresses
    change in TFP on first differences of green-season average temperature and precipitation.
    Statistical uncertainty is handled through block bootstrap estimation.
  9: Econometric analysis using 296 variations of a baseline model. This involves
    regressions based on mismatched datasets (year and country) to assess the effect
    of weather. Impacts of ACC are computed by subtracting TFP with ACC from TFP without
    ACC. The paper uses bootstrapped coefficients and General Circulation Models (GCMs)
    to reflect statistical and climate uncertainty.
  15: Analysis of response functions and placebo checks with reshuffled datasets to
    evaluate the impact of weather changes on TFP.
  17: Regression analysis of TFP and weather data from 1962-1988; Bootstrapping to
    estimate confidence bands; Placebo checks involving reshuffling data by year and
    by country.
  19: Analysis uses data from 1989-2015. Response functions are based on 500 year-by-region
    block bootstraps. Placebo checks are performed by randomly mismatching TFP and
    weather data by year and by country with 10,000 reshuffled datasets.
  25: The analysis uses country-level data from 1962-1988 and involves regression
    analysis. Placebo checks are performed by randomly reshuffling TFP and weather
    data by years and by country to test the robustness of the results.
  27: The analysis uses data from 1989-2015. Response functions are estimated using
    country-level data. Placebo checks are performed by randomly mismatching TFP and
    weather data.
  28: Econometric models; 10-fold cross-validation (years of data are sampled together);
    Out-of-sample MSE reduction relative to a model that excludes weather variables.
More Notes:
  3: TFP has grown much more slowly in certain countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan
    Africa (Fig. 1c). Figure 1d shows how observed annual country-level average temperatures
    fall closer within the range of counterfactual weather trajectories with ACC (gold
    band) than without ACC (grey band).
  4: The temperature response function has become steeper over time (1962-1988 vs
    1989-2015), indicating that higher temperatures have become more damaging.
  5: The study emphasizes that the estimated impact is not the effect of a world without
    fossil fuels, as agriculture has benefited from carbon-intensive inputs. The counterfactual
    only removes the effect that fossil fuels and other anthropogenic influences have
    on climate.
  6: The study acknowledges limitations regarding the direct effect of rising CO2
    concentrations, agricultural research, carbon-intensive inputs, and potential
    measurement error in Total Factor Productivity (TFP). The TFP metric may also
    mismeasure certain inputs like irrigation water use. Ignoring all measured inputs
    overstates ACC impacts.
  9: Measurement error is considered, with a focus on its potential impact on the
    regression results. The paper accounts for the uncertainty introduced by econometric
    model specification by weighting models based on their out-of-sample mean squared
    error (MSE).
  17: The response functions are centered so that the exposure-weighted marginal effect
    is zero. The analysis focuses on the period 1962-1988.
  19: Analysis explores the relationship between agricultural productivity and weather
    variables.
  27: The study examines the response of agricultural productivity to weather variables
    and includes placebo checks to assess the robustness of the results.
  28: The 'baseline model' is highlighted in blue and the paper also considers alternative
    models in grey. Higher bars below the impact estimates indicate better model fit.
