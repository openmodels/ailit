  28: Global impact of anthropogenic climate change
Highlights:
  1: ACC has slowed global agricultural TFP growth, equivalent to losing the last
    7 years of productivity growth; Warmer regions have been more severely affected
  2: Average agricultural TFP has more than doubled since 1961, but there is wide
    cross-country variation.
  4: Higher temperatures have become more damaging to agricultural productivity. ACC
    has significantly reduced global agricultural TFP growth since 1961. Precipitation
    response function is non-linear and peaks at around 500 mm over the green season.
  5: ACC has a negative impact on global average TFP. Impacts are greater for warmer
    regions such as Africa. The response function is changing over time, suggesting
    that global agriculture is growing increasingly sensitive to ongoing climate change.
    Ignoring input responses makes global impacts appear more severe.
  6: ACC is increasingly reducing agricultural output, cumulating into a detectable
    and sizeable impact as of 2020.
  8: Weather parameters are subsequently used in a simulation to derive the effect
    of climate change on global agricultural TFP.
  9: Models that weight revenue regression and aggregate weather data for the 'green
    season' show larger damages, suggesting these approaches better fit the data.

Methodology:
  1: Developed an econometric model of weather effects on global agricultural TFP;
    Combined the model with counterfactual climate scenarios; Baseline model used
    data since 1961
  2: Analysis uses the Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset (GMFD) observations and
    CMIP6 models (seven GCMs) from 1961-2015.
  4: Econometric estimates are linked with counterfactual weather trajectories from
    climate experiments (CMIP6) with and without ACC. Models are based on 1962-2015
    data, with projections to 2020.
  5: "Econometric models (96 model variations) are used to estimate the impact of\
    \ ACC. Models are weighted based on how well they fit the data. Tenfold cross-validation\
    \ is used to assess model fit. The analysis considers different functional forms\
    \ (Quadratic, Cubic), regression weights (Equal, Revenue), aggregation weights\
    \ (Cropland, Cropland and pasture), growing seasons (Calendar year, Green season),\
    \ and heterogeneity (Pooled, By latitude (3)). Analysis based on the latter part\
    \ of the sample (1989\u20132015) points to larger damage. The study covers the\
    \ period since 1961."
  6: Econometric models, considers climate uncertainty (from GCMs), econometric uncertainty
    (from the estimation) and specification uncertainty (from the choice of the econometric
    model). Does not remove direct CO2 effects on agriculture, agricultural research,
    or carbon-intensive inputs.
  8: "The paper uses an econometric model that regresses the change in TFP on first\
    \ differences of green-season average temperature and precipitation, controlling\
    \ for country and year fixed effects. They use a block bootstrap estimation to\
    \ capture statistical uncertainty, sampling observations by year\u2013region.\
    \ The historical weather data comes from the Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset\
    \ (GMFD) and counterfactual weather trajectories are taken from CMIP6 simulations."
  9: The analysis is robust with 296 variations of an econometric model using different
    combinations of temperature metrics, precipitation inclusion, functional forms,
    aggregation methods, and weightings.
  13: Uses country-level data and performs regressions to estimate the response of
    TFP to green-season average temperature and total precipitation. Employs year-by-region
    block bootstraps for confidence intervals. Conducts placebo checks by randomly
    reshuffling TFP and weather data by years and by country.

    Year-by-region and country reshuffling placebo checks are used. 90% and 95% confidence
    bands based on 500 year-by-region block bootstraps are used.
  21: "The analysis uses data from 1962\u20131988, excluding 10% of the coldest countries\
    \ in one instance. Bootstrapping and placebo checks involving reshuffling data\
    \ are used to assess the robustness of results."

    T and P, using block bootstraps and placebo checks with reshuffled datasets.
  25: Analysis uses data from 1962-1988. Response functions are based on regression
    analysis, with block bootstraps used to generate confidence intervals. Placebo
    checks involve reshuffling TFP and weather data by years and by country.
  27: Analysis of TFP and weather data from 1989-2015. Response functions are estimated
    with country-by-region block bootstraps. Placebo checks are performed by randomly

    of T and P coefficients.

    and annual precipitation data.
