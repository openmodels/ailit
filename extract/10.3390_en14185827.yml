Drivers of Risk:
  2: Zimbabwe's electricity system is vulnerable to climate change due to its reliance
    on hydropower, which could be impacted by changing rainfall patterns.
  4: Intermittency of renewable energy sources (wind and solar), dependence on hydropower
    which is vulnerable to regional water shortages, reliance on coal-fired generation.
  6: Climate change impacts are simulated by altering the quantity of water available
    for hydro generation and corresponding capacity factors.
  8: The primary driver of risk considered is energy demand and the fuel sources used
    to meet that demand. Climate change vulnerability is mentioned as a future consideration.
  9: The threat of Climate Change
  10: Climate change (drought, low rainfall), dependence on hydropower, biomass dependence,
    deforestation
  12: Climate change impacts (drying climate leading to water shortages affecting
    hydropower), Over-dependence on hydropower, Insufficient planning considering
    climate futures, Lack of adaptive measures, Emissions from energy sources
  13: No specific shocks or changes impacting macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes mentioned.
  14: The need for investment in renewable energy due to low capacity factors and
    the potential role of regional power trade are identified as significant factors
    influencing the adaptation scenarios.
  15: Climate constraints, energy policy choices (fossil vs. clean), inaction on climate
    change.
  16: Climate change; Dry climate futures; Reactive coal-based reinforcement
  17: Lack of aggressive action on Zimbabwe's Nationally Determined Contributions
    (NDCs).
  18: Uncertainty (specifically climate futures and other development uncertainties)
    is a driver necessitating a change in planning approach.
  19: Upstream water diversion and pumping for agriculture reducing hydropower potential
    while increasing electricity demand; climate change impacts on power trade and
    river basins; structure of coal purchase contracts and employment of miners hindering
    a drop in coal production when renewable energy production is high.
  22: Climate change scenarios including RCP4.5, RCP8.5, A2, and A1B using various
    Global Climate Models (GCMs) and downscaling techniques (UCT, Princeton-BCSD).
    Specific climate scenarios V3, V4, and V5 are considered, impacting the efficacy
    of adaptation measures.
Highlights:
  2: 'The paper identifies two adaptation pathways: 1) increase reliance on coal to
    make the electricity system more resilient but increase emissions, and 2) boost
    solar and wind capacity, use hydropower for balance, and introduce energy efficiency
    measures to achieve system resilience and meet NDC targets.'
  6: The study assesses the impact of climate change on Zimbabwe's NDC investments
    in the energy sector, comparing a 'Fossil Future', 'SDP+', and 'NDC' scenario.
  10: Zimbabwe's economy and achievement of NDCs are vulnerable to climate change;
    Drought conditions lead to food shortages, power cuts, and crippled economy; Hydropower
    and biomass dependence are significant vulnerabilities; Deforestation is accelerated
    by drought.
  12: Inaction results in high economic damage, more than double the cost of action;
    NDC investments can lead to national economic calamity if climate change impacts
    are not considered; Coal reinforcement avoids economic damage but drastically
    increases emissions; Clean adaptation balances renewables, energy efficiency,
    hydropower, and coal, resulting in lower emissions and cost but requires strong
    institutional requirements.
  13: No important outcomes related to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes mentioned.
  14: Clean adaptation is considered to have a marginally lower cost than coal adaptation.
    It requires significant investment in renewable energy, yet achieves lower emissions
    than coal adaptation.
  15: Clean adaptation with NDCs is lower cost and lower emitting; inaction is dangerous
    and damages the economy; a fossil future is achievable but highly emitting.
  16: Climate proofing NDCs and exceeding mitigation targets is feasible, low carbon
    and potentially economically beneficial. Aiming to meet NDC targets with no climate
    resilience plan is economically dangerous. An NDC future is at risk under climate
    change and, with reactive coal-based reinforcement, it will lead to all emissions
    gains being lost.
  17: Without aggressive action, Zimbabwe's NDC gains may be lost at high economic
    and environmental costs.
  18: The need for updated planning approaches that account for uncertainty in climate
    futures and development, the importance of policy coherence across sectors, and
    the availability of tools like the Global Electrification Platform.
  19: Vulnerabilities can reinforce themselves if appropriate analysis is not done;
    a balancing market is recommended to absorb electricity from intermittent renewable
    sources; a special reserve fund should be developed to allow for the stockpiling
    of coal when it is not needed; energy efficiency and demand-side measures are
    growing in importance.
Methodology:
  2: The analysis uses the Open-Source energy Modelling SYStem (OSeMOSYS) to consider
    adaptation pathways for Zimbabwe's electricity system.
  6: The study uses OSeMOSYS, an open-source energy systems model, to analyze the
    impact of climate change on Zimbabwe's electricity sector. The model minimizes
    total discounted costs subject to operational constraints.
  10: "Analysis uses climate projections from the World Bank study, Enhancing the\
    \ Climate Resilience of Africa\u2019s Infrastructure (ECRAI); Downscaled rainfall\
    \ data is used to calculate projected runoff, which is allocated across the Zambezi\
    \ basin; Hydropower production data is fed into an energy systems model of Zimbabwe;\
    \ The model uses an optimization routine to estimate an electric energy price\
    \ trajectory."
  12: Scenario analysis using GISS-E2-H climate future with adaptive action and NDC
    investments; Comparison of different adaptation options (coal reinforcement, clean
    adaptation) against inaction and NDC targets.
  13: No specific methodology related to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes analysis
    mentioned.
  14: Analysis involves comparative scenarios (Coal Adaptation, Clean Adaptation,
    and NDC-No Adaptation) for energy and financial impacts, observing trends from
    2010 to 2050 in various energy metrics.
  15: Power trade modeling, unspecified underlying assumptions, the original study
    didn't consider climate constraints.
  16: Proof-of-concept analysis using scenarios and limited climate runs. Draws from
    existing studies. Considers System Development Plan and NDC targets. Technology
    characteristics taken from international averages.
  17: The model assumes a perfect market, which needs to be restructured. It also
    assumes deep changes in the operation of hydropower.
  18: The text advocates for a 'running analysis across a large ensemble of potential
    climate futures' and other development uncertainties to identify infrastructure
    and objectives at risk. It also promotes integrated analysis across sectors, such
    as between bulk power development and off-grid expansion in the electricity sector.
  19: The paper recommends harmonization between hydropower planning and water/agriculture
    policy, building local capacity for analysis, developing a balancing market, establishing
    a special reserve fund for coal stockpiling, and assessing large-scale advanced
    energy efficiency adoption.
  20: OSeMOSYS aims to find the lowest cost and most feasible configuration of technologies
    and investments to meet an objective.
  22: The analysis uses different climate scenarios derived from various GCMs, emission
    pathways, and downscaling methods to assess the impact of climate change and adaptation
    strategies. The scenario tree lists the source GCM, emissions scenario, CMIP vintage,
    and downscaling method for each climate scenario.
More Notes:
  4: The text discusses Zimbabwe's energy sector and the challenges of integrating
    renewable energy sources. It touches upon the country's reliance on regional power
    imports and the vulnerability of hydropower to water shortages. This is relevant
    to macro-fiscal risks of climate change because energy security and affordability
    are key factors impacting economic growth and government finances. Climate change
    impacts on water availability and coal availability will impact the energy sector,
    and therefore economic and fiscal conditions.
  8: The page sets the stage for understanding Zimbabwe's NDC potential and vulnerability
    to climate change, but doesn't present specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
    The impact of climate change on the energy sector is mentioned as a follow-up
    item, but no specific details are provided here.
  10: The analysis focuses on relatively dry climate futures from the CMIP5 scenarios
    to assess risks to achieving NDCs; The Southern African Power Pool's reliance
    on the Zambezi basin for hydropower creates regional vulnerability.
  12: The study uses Petajoules (PJ) as a unit for energy measurement; Short-term
    power shortages may occur even with adaptation due to the time required for new
    plant construction; The clean adaptation case requires market and institutional
    support for balancing coal use and increasing renewables.
  13: Page primarily contains descriptions of energy charts and scenarios, which do
    not directly relate to the requested categories.
  14: The analysis suggests the potential benefits of regional power trade in managing
    supply differences across regions, especially in the context of variable hydropower
    availability.
  15: The power trade scenario is Africa-wide and assumes free trade radically increased
    over current levels; Future work must consider climate constraints.
  16: Analysis is limited by limited climate runs, scenario calibration, missing detail
    for policy formulation, lack of consideration of structural changes and technology
    characteristics consistent with local conditions, regional market design, pan-water
    basin analysis, and ecosystem/institutional requirements.
  17: The paper recommends a pragmatic policy pathway and milestone approach to implementing
    clean adaptation policies and measures (PAMs).
  18: The page emphasizes the importance of identifying optimal trade-offs and pragmatic
    next steps in energy infrastructure deployment, mentioning examples for integrated
    analysis in Moksnes et al. [58] and Mentis et al. [59].
  19: The work could be valuably extended from Zimbabwe to assess the Southern African
    region due to the transboundary nature of power trade and river basins; the national
    context and potential to take advantage of specific PAMs needs to be developed
    to account of new technology and business models.
  20: The paper references several supporting online resources, including data, code,
    model files, and training materials related to OSeMOSYS.
  22: The scenarios include 'Business as Usual Climate', 'Climate V3', 'Climate V4',
    'Climate V4/4a', and 'Climate V5', each with corresponding scenarios like 'NDC'
    (Nationally Determined Contribution) with and without adaptation measures. The
    adaptation measures considered for Climate V3 include 'Coal adaptation', 'EE adaptation'
    (Energy Efficiency), and 'EE & RET adaptation' (Energy Efficiency & Renewable
    Energy Technologies).
