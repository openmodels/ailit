  2: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change and its ecological consequences
  2: Demographic (waning population growth), Urbanization, Geopolitical (intensification
    of international conflicts), Climate (worsening environmental and climate problems,
    resource supply), Technological (new risks connected to bio- and information and
    communication technologies).
  6: Environmental pollution exacerbated by industrial waste and transport emissions.
  9: Increasing cost of basic resources and factors of production negatively impacts
    business income.
  11: "End of economic growth as part of the \u2018energy pole\u2019 model; Transformation\
    \ in energy markets; Capital intensity of energy resource extraction; Revolution\
    \ in de facto standards linked to ICT and new materials; Expanding demographic\
    \ and environmental crises; Increased security risks; Fundamental changes in medico-biological\
    \ technologies and in ICT."
Highlights:
  1: Climate change and its ecological consequences drive demand for a range of technologies.
  2: Technological development is considered the primary solution to long-term challenges
    facing Russian socio-economic development.
  6: Migration influx amid labor shortages could lead to social tension and increased
    state spending on migrant rehabilitation.
  9: There is a steady decline in the global situation with low commodity prices and
    rising costs for technologies and funding; socio-economic imbalance and consolidation
    of class structure; international conflicts making it more difficult to access
    key technological expertise.
  11: 'Russian economy will face two waves of strategic challenges: one around 2020
    linked to the end of the energy pole model, and another around 2030-2035 linked
    to changes in medico-biological technologies and ICT.'
Methodology:
  1: Exploration of several groups of challenges, namely urbanization, demographic,
    socio-economic, the consequences of ageing, geopolitical, restricted access to
    key technological competences, climate change and its ecological consequences,
    as well as technological challenges.
  2: The methodology involves textual analysis, expert surveys (Foresight studies),
    and projecting global dynamics onto the domestic situation to identify industry
    challenges and opportunities. It was developed as part of the preparation and
    update of the coordinated long-term socio-economic and science and technology
    (S&T) development forecast for Russia.
  9: Industry analysis is used to outline current challenges to the development of
    certain sectors of the Russian economy.
  11: "Analysis of challenges facing Russia\u2019s socio-economic development."
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on long-term socio-economic challenges for Russia and demand
    for new technology, broader than solely macroeconomic effects of climate change.
    Climate change is listed as one of several challenges facing Russia.
  9: The page discusses challenges to long-term socio-economic development in Russia.
  11: The paper focuses on Russia and its specific challenges related to technological
    modernization, economic diversification, and global integration.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  6: Social tension from migrant influx amid labor resource shortages, impacting state
    spending.
  9: Decline in the global situation leads to low commodity prices, growing cost and
    falling accessibility of technologies and funding responsible for low national
    currency value.
  11: "Challenges facing Russia\u2019s socio-economic development, technological modernization,\
    \ and long-term national development strategy; Negative social effects such as\
    \ new social inequalities and asymmetry in access to technologies; Undermining\
    \ the stability of the social structure in Russia and its sovereignty."
Quantitative material:
  1: No relevant information
  6: Projected increase in demographic burden from 400 to 510 elderly citizens per
    1,000 citizens capable of work by 2030.
  9: Income ratio has fluctuated between 16 and 17 (referring to social inequality).
