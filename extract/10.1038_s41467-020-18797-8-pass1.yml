Drivers of Risk:
  1: Aleatory uncertainty, which is the irreducible uncertainty remaining even when
    true parameter values are known, leading to economic damages.
  2: "Annual global mean temperature anomaly (\u0394T)."
  3: Inter-annual temperature variability and the uncertainty related to equilibrium
    climate sensitivity (ECS) impact climate damages.
  4: The drivers of risk are temperature variability (aleatory uncertainty), uncertainty
    in climate sensitivity (epistemic uncertainty), and RCP scenarios (RCP8.5, RCP6.0,
    RCP4.5, RCP2.6). Autocorrelation of temperatures is also discussed as a potential
    risk amplifier.
Evaluation overview:
  1: The article discusses the economic damages from climate change due to temperature
    variability.
  2: Economic damages from climate change, measured as a share of global annual output.
  3: Evaluates the willingness to pay to avoid inter-annual temperature variability
    under different climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, RCP8.5) and
    its impact on global output.
  4: This study evaluates economic damages from climate change, focusing on the impact
    of temperature variability (aleatory uncertainty) and uncertainty about climate
    sensitivity (epistemic uncertainty) on these damages.
Highlights:
  2: Adding realistic temperature variability creates substantial uncertainty in future
    damages, equivalent to trillions of dollars of previously unaccounted for economic
    costs of climate change. The benefits of adaptation are much greater than previously
    believed.
  3: Stochastic models show higher risk premia than deterministic models; a social
    planner would pay up to 4% to 40% of current global output to avoid variability,
    depending on the RCP scenario.
  4: The study finds that adding temperature variability to integrated assessment
    models results in greater economic damages from climate change. The interaction
    between aleatory and epistemic uncertainty leads to a disproportionately high
    cost, resulting in damage distributions with a fatter right tail. The study suggests
    the benefits of adaptation are much greater than previously believed. The true
    cost of temperature variability is likely to be substantially larger than estimated
    if damages accumulate during longer periods of extreme climate.
Methodology:
  1: The paper proposes a method to account for aleatory uncertainty in a physically
    well-founded and tractable way.
  2: Uses a stochastic climate model (equation provided) and a non-linear damage function
    to calculate annual economic damages. These are then discounted and summed across
    all future years. Compares deterministic and stochastic model results under RCP2.6
    and RCP8.5 scenarios.
  3: Uses deterministic and stochastic models to assess temperature trajectories and
    the associated risk premia based on variability and uncertainty about ECS.
  4: "The analysis uses an ensemble of temperature trajectories derived from a deterministic\
    \ Energy Balance Model (EBM) and a stochastic EBM to represent epistemic and aleatory\
    \ uncertainty, respectively. The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is assumed\
    \ to be log-normally distributed with a most likely value of 3\xB0C and Pr(2 \u2264\
    \ ECS \u2264 4.5) = 0.66. Risk premia are calculated as the difference in expected\
    \ utility of damages between the two ensembles. The study acknowledges the use\
    \ of a 4.25% discount rate."
More Notes:
  2: The paper suggests that official assessments of climate damages rely on deterministic
    GMT models that omit deviations of individual realistic trajectories from the
    trajectory of the expectation. The 'risk premium' is defined as the cost the social
    planner would pay to follow the deterministic temperature trajectory rather than
    face an uncertain future.
  4: The study mentions that the simple integrated assessment models were built with
    a deterministic climate in mind, and are poorly equipped to deal with the consequences
    of temperature autocorrelation. The study acknowledges that the cost of adaptation
    is beyond the scope of the present investigation.
Quantitative material:
  1: The analysis implies trillions of dollars of previously unaccounted for economic
    damages due to modest variability.
  2: Deterministic model forecasts $486 trillion in total damages for RCP8.5, stochastic
    model assigns a 5% chance to damages exceeding $563 trillion. 5-95% range for
    stochastic model is (-13%, +16%) of deterministic forecast for RCP8.5, and (-30%,
    +52%) for RCP2.6.
  3: 'Provides risk premium values for different RCP scenarios: $3 trillion (RCP2.6),
    $9 trillion (RCP4.5), $15 trillion (RCP6.0), $32 trillion (RCP8.5), representing
    percentages of current global output.'
  4: The study provides quantitative estimates of risk premia in trillions of USD
    (Tr) for different RCP scenarios, broken down into aleatory-only risk premium
    and the risk interaction effect (aleatory x epistemic). E.g., for RCP8.5, aleatory
    risk premium is 32Tr, aleatory x epistemic interaction risk premium is 14Tr, and
    the total risk premium is 46Tr (58%). For RCP6.0, the corresponding values are
    15Tr, 16Tr and 31Tr (39%). For RCP4.5, the values are 9Tr, 16Tr, and 25Tr (31%).
    For RCP2.6, the values are 3Tr, 6Tr, and 9Tr (11%).
