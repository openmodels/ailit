Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature variability (aleatory uncertainty) contributes to economic damages
    from climate change. Epistemic uncertainty (imprecise estimates of key model parameters)
    is also a driver of risk.
  2: Variability in global mean temperature (GMT), both internal and related to different
    realizations; Aleatory uncertainty in future temperatures; Epistemic uncertainty.
  4: Aleatory uncertainty (inherent randomness in climate processes) and epistemic
    uncertainty (uncertainty due to lack of knowledge, particularly regarding equilibrium
    climate sensitivity - ECS).
Highlights:
  1: The paper demonstrates that even modest temperature variability implies trillions
    of dollars of previously unaccounted for economic damages, a cost often not considered
    in influential assessments of the economic cost of climate change.
  2: Adding realistic temperature variability creates substantial uncertainty in future
    damages, equivalent to trillions of dollars of previously unaccounted for economic
    costs; the benefits of adaptation are much greater than previously believed due
    to this uncertainty.
  3: Risk premia reflect significant costs of temperature variability; higher risk
    premia under scenarios like RCP8.5 indicate a greater willingness to pay to mitigate
    uncertainty.
  4: Adding temperature variability to simple integrated assessment models results
    in greater economic damages from climate change. The interaction between aleatory
    and epistemic uncertainty creates disproportionately costly high-draws from the
    ECS distribution.
Methodology:
  1: The study accounts for aleatory uncertainty (irreducible uncertainty even when
    true parameter values are known) in a physically well-founded and tractable way.
  2: Uses a simple stochastic physical model (equation provided) to simulate GMT,
    calibrating to historical data. This model incorporates Gaussian noise to represent
    variability. Damages are calculated by passing annual GMT anomaly through a non-linear
    damage function, then discounting and summing across future years.
  3: A deterministic and stochastic model to analyze temperature trajectories with
    risk premia calculated for different RCP forcings using a 4.25% discount rate.
  4: "A deterministic energy balance model (EBM) is solved for a distribution of ECS\
    \ values (log-normal, most likely value of 3\xB0C, Pr(2 \u2264 ECS \u2264 4.5)\
    \ = 0.66). Two ensembles of temperature trajectories are generated: one with epistemic\
    \ uncertainty only, and another incorporating both epistemic and aleatory uncertainty.\
    \ Risk premia are the difference between the expected utility of damages for the\
    \ two ensembles."
More Notes:
  1: The paper critiques the reliance on a small number of coupled climate-economy
    models that primarily account for epistemic uncertainty but fail to account for
    aleatory uncertainty.
  2: Deterministic models underestimate the economic consequences of climate change
    by omitting the impact of temperature variability.
  3: The interaction of aleatory and epistemic uncertainties leads to potentially
    larger economic impacts than previously accounted.
  4: The study suggests that the benefits of adaptation are much greater than previously
    believed. High discount rates and the handling of temperature autocorrelation
    make their estimates conservative. The SCC (Social Cost of Carbon) and risk premium
    provide answers to two different questions. The damage function and the social
    welfare function have no memory.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic damages are assessed in terms of dollars.
  2: Total economic damages from climate change, measured as a share of global annual
    output and expressed in trillions of dollars; Risk premium, representing the value
    of insurance against aleatory uncertainty about future temperatures or the amount
    a social planner would pay to avoid temperature uncertainty.
  4: Economic damages from climate change, quantified as risk premiums (willingness
    to pay to avoid uncertainty) in Trillion USD.
Quantitative material:
  1: Modest temperature variability implies trillions of dollars of previously unaccounted
    for economic damages.
  2: Deterministic model forecasts $486 trillion in total damages for RCP8.5. Stochastic
    model gives a 5% chance of damages exceeding $563 trillion (16% higher). Stochastic
    model 5-95% range is (-13%, +16%) of deterministic forecast under RCP8.5 and (-30%,
    +52%) of deterministic forecast under RCP2.6 ($30 trillion).
  3: Risk premia are included showing potential willingness to pay to avoid inter-annual
    temperature variability, with amounts like $46 trillion for RCP8.5, estimated
    as over half of current global output.
  4: "Risk premiums are quantified in Trillion USD for different RCP scenarios (8.5,\
    \ 6.0, 4.5, 2.6), decomposed into aleatory-only and aleatory \xD7 epistemic interaction\
    \ effects. For example, under RCP8.5, the risk premium is 32Tr for aleatory-only\
    \ uncertainty and 46Tr (58%) when including the interaction effect."
