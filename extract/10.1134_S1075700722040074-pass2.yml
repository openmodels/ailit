Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts, including global warming, leading to an increase in the
    number of poor and migrants, risks to human health, and threats to sustainable
    economic development.
  2: Climate change, climate-related phenomena and disasters.
  3: Insufficient financing of adaptation measures, dangerous natural phenomena, disasters,
    ecosystem degradation, failure of developed countries to meet financial assistance
    obligations to developing countries as outlined in the Paris Agreement, and prioritization
    of decarbonization over adaptation.
  4: Climate change impacts and the global climate agenda's focus on decarbonization
    over adaptation are key drivers of risk. The paper highlights the influence of
    the EU and global trends on Russia's climate policy.
  5: Increased vulnerability of Russian population and economy, especially infrastructure,
    to climate change effects like warming.
  6: Climate change impacts and natural disasters.
  8: Climate change impacts, uneven and temporally stretched effects of climatic factors,
    and varying degrees of vulnerability across different population groups and economic
    sectors are identified as drivers of risk.
  10: Climate change impact.
Highlights:
  1: Adaptation measures have a high economic efficiency with a multiplicative effect
    and benefits that outweigh costs by a factor of four.
  2: Developing countries face significant infrastructure damage from climate-related
    disasters, costing approximately 1% of their combined GDP; Adaptation efforts
    in developing countries are underfunded, representing less than 0.15% of their
    combined GDP.
  3: Adaptation financing is significantly lower than decarbonization efforts, leading
    to a reduction in the adaptation potential of natural ecosystems, and failure
    for developed countries to meet financial assistance obligations to developing
    countries as outlined in the Paris Agreement.
  4: The paper argues that adaptation is treated as a secondary concern compared to
    decarbonization in climate policy, leading to insufficient attention and resources
    allocated to adaptation measures in Russia. The lack of a national adaptation
    plan by early 2022, despite its initial plan for development by the end of 2018,
    illustrates this point.
  5: Investment in high-tech remote sensing and modern climate models can save at
    least 200 billion dollars per year.
  6: Delaying investment decisions on adaptation by 10 years increases adaptation
    costs by an average of two times for developing countries (with low and middle
    incomes).
  8: The paper emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and utilizing
    global experience in adaptation planning, particularly highlighting the EU's new
    adaptation strategy as a potentially valuable model for Russia. It also points
    to the need for integrating adaptation measures into strategic planning documents
    at the federal level and for tailored adaptation plans at the sectoral and regional
    levels.
  10: Adaptation measures have high economic efficiency (multiplier effect inclusive);
    adaptation is crucial for maintaining sustainable long-term socioeconomic development
    in Russia; adaptation policy should be integrated into sustainable long-term development
    strategies.
Methodology:
  8: The paper advocates for integrating adaptation planning into key strategic planning
    documents at the federal level in Russia, such as the Strategy for Long-Term Socio-Economic
    Development of Russia and the Strategy for Spatial Development of Russia. It also
    suggests using the upcoming Third Assessment Report on Climate Change and its
    Consequences on the Territory of the Russian Federation as a scientific basis
    for adaptation planning.
  10: Analysis within the context of sustainable development strategies, focusing
    on strategic decision-making processes and planning.
More Notes:
  1: The paper emphasizes the need to increase the role of adaptation to climate change
    in strategic planning, especially in socio-economic policy, and the usefulness
    of integrating foreign experience into the long-term sustainable development strategy.
  4: The paper focuses on the Russian context and the implementation of climate policies,
    pointing to a potential gap between the global emphasis on decarbonization and
    the necessary focus on adaptation at the national level. The paper was written
    in 2022.
  5: Adaptation provides immediate benefit nationally by reducing climate risks, while
    decarbonization effects have a longer global lag.
  8: The author mentions the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) as a risk
    to the Russian economy, while viewing the EU's adaptation strategy as a potentially
    valuable international experience for Russia.
  10: The paper argues that adaptation is often put further back in strategic decision-making
    compared to decarbonization, despite its importance. It emphasizes the need for
    Russia to reasonably apply international experience in adaptation planning.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic efficiency of adaptation measures, losses and damages from climate change
    and its consequences for socio-economic development
  2: The cost of climate-related phenomena and disasters for developing countries'
    infrastructure is approximately $250 billion, or about 1% of their combined GDP.
  3: Upgrowth in costs of adaptation to $140-170 billion by 2030 and $250-280 billion
    by 2050 for developing countries, and impacts on GDP.
  4: The paper discusses the underestimation of adaptation in climate policy compared
    to decarbonization, implying potential negative macroeconomic outcomes due to
    insufficient adaptation measures. It mentions the lack of a national adaptation
    plan in Russia despite its importance.
  5: Expected annual damage from permafrost degradation in the Russian Arctic is estimated
    at 200 billion rubles per year.
  6: Reduction of expected human losses and economic damage; Generation of additional
    income and increased productivity; Benefits of ecological and cultural nature,
    in particular, for recreation and tourism.
  8: The paper discusses the need to strengthen adaptation potential and minimize
    vulnerability to the unavoidable consequences of climate change for the Russian
    economy.
  10: Economic efficiency of adaptation measures; losses and damage from climate change
    impact; sustainable long-term socioeconomic development.
Quantitative material:
  1: Benefits of adaptation on average exceed costs by a factor of four.
  2: $250 billion cost to developing countries' infrastructure; 1% of developing countries'
    combined GDP; Adaptation costs for developing countries were $70 billion in 2019,
    less than 0.15% of their combined GDP.
  3: Adaptation costs for 46 countries are estimated at $783 billion for 2015-2030,
    averaging $52 billion per year. With 184 countries registered, estimated adaptation
    spending would be less than $210 billion annually, or less than 0.2% of global
    GDP. Adaptation costs for developing countries are projected to increase from
    $70 billion in 2020 to $140-170 billion by 2030 and $250-280 billion by 2050.
  5: Implementation of adaptation measures could reduce expected damage in developing
    countries by 2-3 times and reduce costs from 120-670 billion dollars to 11-65
    billion dollars annually.
  6: Investments in the development of early warning systems for dangerous natural
    phenomena and disasters provide benefit/cost ratio of 10:1; in measures to protect
    coastal shrub vegetation (mangroves, etc.) - 6:1; in ensuring the resilience to
    weather and climate impacts of new (under construction, projected) infrastructure
    facilities, as well as in improving technologies for growing grain crops in arid
    lands - 5:1.
  10: World average benefits of adaptation surpassing costs four-fold.
