Drivers of Risk:
  1: Higher summer temperatures (specifically in January).
  2: Temperature and rain precipitation fluctuations
  3: Climate change
  5: Changes in temperature and precipitation.
  6: Climate change impacts on yearly precipitation and temperature.
  7: Changes in yearly precipitation and temperature across different macrozones in
    Chile (North, Central, South, Metropolitan).
  8: Changes in yearly minimum, maximum and mean in precipitation and temperature
  9: Temperature and precipitation are highlighted as influencing factors, with additional
    consideration of international shocks such as financial crises or commodity demand.
  10: Temperature and precipitation (quarterly averages)
  12: Global temperature changes under different RCP scenarios; specific shocks include
    temperature increases affecting industry performance.
  13: "Global temperature increase (0.26\xB0C, 1.0\xB0C, 1.3\xB0C, 1.4\xB0C, 2.0\xB0\
    C, 1.8\xB0C, 2.2\xB0C, 3.7\xB0C) after 1985 or 2017."
  14: Temperature increase
  15: Climate change, particularly temperature increases, is the primary driver impacting
    various industries.
  16: "Temperature increase (1.0\xB0C, 1.3\xB0C, 1.4\xB0C, 2.0\xB0C for 2050; 1.0\xB0\
    C, 1.8\xB0C, 2.2\xB0C, 3.7\xB0C for 2100)."
  17: Higher temperatures, particularly in January, and to a lesser extent fluctuations
    in precipitation.
Highlights:
  1: Higher summer temperatures have a negative impact on Agriculture-Silviculture
    and Fishing. Climate change did not have a big impact on the Chilean economy during
    the period studied (1985-2017). Stress test exercises suggest significant GDP
    reductions in 2050 and 2100 under negative scenarios.
  2: Climate change has a statistically significant impact during the Summer season
    for the Agriculture and Fishing sectors in Chile. Main econometric results imply
    a low impact of climate change in Chile over the past 35 years.
  3: Examines the impact of climate change on economic output across industries in
    Chile.
  5: Financial Services and Commerce are more prevalent in the capital region than
    at the national level, while Mining has almost no value for the capital region,
    even if it represents the largest economic sector in the nation. Mean precipitation
    has been falling in Chile over time, while mean temperatures have increased substantially.
  6: Mean temperatures are increasing in all macrozones, and mean precipitation is
    decreasing in Central, South and Metropolitan macrozones.
  7: Significant decreases in maximum and mean precipitation across most Chilean macrozones
    between 1950 and 2017, with some regional variations.
  8: "The results document a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperatures\
    \ for Chile and all its macrozones (except the North) between 1980\u20131989 and\
    \ 2010\u20132017. Mean temperatures for the Central, South and Metropolitan macrozones\
    \ increased by 0.52, 0.33 and 0.67 Celsius degrees, respectively, between 1980\u2013\
    1989 and 2010\u20132017 with surface weights, while maximum temperatures increased\
    \ by 1.11, 0.37 and 1.07 Celsius degrees."
  9: Warmer temperatures and changes in precipitation affect economic growth and productivity
    across various industries in Chile.
  10: A statistically negative impact of temperature on the Agriculture-Silviculture
    and Fishing sectors is observed. A statistically significant negative impact for
    the temperature of the January month in Agriculture-Silviculture, Fishing, Electricity,
    Gas, and Water (EGA), and Construction sectors.
  12: Climate change could negatively impact industries such as Agriculture, Fishing,
    Manufacture, and others in Chile, with specific percentage reductions in GDP growth
    rates.
  13: Under the assumption that all model's coefficients are applicable, Fishing,
    Mining, Home Ownership, and Public Administration are the only industries negatively
    impacted by climate change in 2050 and 2100. Fishing GDP almost disappears by
    2100 with a 1.0C increase. With all coefficients, Mining and Home Property would
    decrease by 55% and 25.5% respectively. However, climate change has a strong positive
    impact on other sectors, with increases in total Chilean GDP across scenarios.
    Under the assumption that only statistically significant coefficients are applicable,
    Agriculture, Fishing, Manufacture, EGA, Construction and Commerce are the only
    industries negatively impacted at the horizons of 2050 and 2100. Climate change
    would have a positive impact on all other economic sectors and total Chilean GDP.
  14: Agriculture, Fishing, Manufacture, EGA, Construction and Commerce are the only
    industries hurt by climate change at the horizons of 2050 or 2100. The negative
    impact of climate change on the total GDP could range between 9% and 14.8% in
    2050 and between 16.8% and 29.6% in 2100 when only statistically significant and
    negative values are considered.
  15: The construction industry faces a potential decline of 12.7% to 23.8% by 2050.
    Mining may positively impact GDP, mitigating overall negative effects from other
    industries.
  16: Climate change could imply a deterioration between 6.8% and 12.9% on total Chilean
    GDP in 2050, and between 15.5% and 42.3% by 2100.
  17: Climate change has had a statistically significant negative effect on economic
    activity in Chile, primarily due to higher temperatures. The Agriculture-Silviculture
    and Fishing sectors are most affected by high summer temperatures. While some
    sectors are negatively impacted, others may experience positive effects from temperature
    increases. Projections of GDP change by 2050 and 2100 vary significantly based
    on whether all model coefficients or only statistically significant coefficients
    are considered.
Methodology:
  1: Region-industry panel data for Chile over the period 1985 to 2017.
  2: Econometric model using annual frequency GDP data for 12 economic sectors across
    15 regions of Chile over the period 1985 to 2017, including temperature and precipitation
    for each season as control variables, industry-region growth lag, time fixed-effects
    at the year level, and fixed-effects for the regions.
  3: "Uses National Accounts data publicly available from the Central Bank of Chile;\
    \ Creates a 15 region and 12 industry panel series for 1985-2007 by assuming constant\
    \ industry-level GDP shares of divided regions I and X; Adjusts GDP data reported\
    \ in four separate series (1985\u20131996, 1996\u20132003, 2003\u20132008, 2008\u2013\
    2017) with base years 1986, 1996, 2003, and 2013, respectively, by harmonizing\
    \ the data using adjustment factors based on the ratio of GDP in adjacent series."
  5: "The study uses weather data from the University of Delaware Air Temperature\
    \ and Precipitation dataset (1900\u20132017) with a grid size of 0.5 degree latitude\
    \ x 0.5 degree longitude, aggregated to the regional level using geospatial software\
    \ (QGIS). Regional weather series are created as a weighted average of the weather\
    \ series of each grid, where the weight is equal to the share of the grid that\
    \ intersects the region. GDP data is combined with weather data."
  6: The authors created 4 macrozones to summarize regional heterogeneities. Weighted
    averages of temperature and precipitation by regional GDP and surface area are
    calculated. The distribution of precipitation and temperature is compared between
    1950-1985 and 1985-2017, and specifically decades 1950-1959, 1980-1989, and 2010-2017.
  7: Analysis of precipitation and temperature data (minimum, maximum, mean) weighted
    by surface area and regional GDP for each macrozone (North, Central, South, Metropolitan)
    during the period 1950-2017.
  8: "The analysis compares averages for precipitation and temperature across different\
    \ periods (1950-1959, 1980-1989, and 2010-2017) and macrozones in Chile, weighting\
    \ results by region\u2019s surface area and regional GDP in 2017."
  9: Panel structure econometric model with fixed-effects for region-industry and
    year-industry, incorporating lagged GDP growth and weather variables.
  10: OLS with fixed-effects by time and region, separate regressions by industry.
    Robust standard errors clustered by year and region.
  12: Modeling of climate change impact using RCP scenarios; regression analysis with
    industry-level GDP impacts based on temperature changes, considering statistical
    significance and negative effects.
  13: The analysis simulates the impact of climate change on different industries
    in Chile, calculating the effect on GDP and growth rates, using regression coefficients
    from Table 5. The analysis is performed for past (1985-2017) and future (2050,
    2100) time horizons, considering different temperature increase scenarios.
  14: Simulations were performed to assess the impact of climate change on the industry,
    overall GDP, and growth rates in Chile. Statistically significant coefficients
    from a monthly model (Table 5 in the source publication) are used. Two tables
    were created by using only significant coefficients(Table 8) and then by only
    using significant and negative coefficients(Table 9).
  15: The analysis uses a model predicting climate change impact on GDP and an exercise
    applying US state industry coefficients to Chilean contexts.
  16: Simulations using climate change temperature coefficients estimated for the
    USA industry (post-1997) from Colacito, Hoffmann and Phan (2019), with some coefficients
    from pre-1997 data also used in Table 11. The applicability is for Chile.
  17: Panel data regression analysis using annual region-industry data for Chile from
    1985 to 2017. Climate change projections are based on the average of global climate
    paths published by the United Nations. Stress tests used both the 2014 and 2021
    IPCC scenarios.
More Notes:
  2: The paper uses a dataset specific for Chile and its regions-industries, unlike
    most studies that use international level datasets.
  3: The study uses data from 1985-2017, divided into four time series with different
    base years. It addresses a change in regional divisions in 2007 by creating a
    consistent panel data set.
  5: 'The paper uses two weighting methods: by surface area and by GDP of each region,
    when aggregating to the national level. GDP weighted measures are considered more
    accurate for activities like agriculture, transports and services. Surface area
    weights are a better proxy for the impact on natural habitats and biodiversity.'
  6: The four macrozones are North Chile (regions I, II, III, IV, XV), Central Chile
    (regions V, VI, VII, VIII), South Chile (regions IX, X, XI, XII, XIV), and Metropolitan
    Region (region XIII).
  7: The page describes trends in precipitation and temperature, suggesting a potential
    link to economic output but does not directly quantify that link. The paper's
    main contribution on this page is a description of climate trends.
  8: "The North macrozone experienced a large increase in temperature between 1950\u2013\
    1959, followed by a strong decrease between 1980\u20131989 and 2010\u20132017."
  10: The analysis is performed on Chilean data and covers 35 years. Lagged industry
    GDP growth is included in each regression. The results are presented as reduced-form
    coefficients.
  13: The authors acknowledge that the large positive impacts on some sectors are
    unlikely to materialize in reality due to the coefficients not being fixed over
    time. It is more realistic that these positive impacts decline over time and can
    turn into negative effects.
  14: EGA stands for Electricity, Gas and Water. Industry sectors are (1) Agriculture
    and Forestry, (2) Fishing, (3) Mining, (4) Manufacturing, (5) EGA, (6) Construction,
    (7) Commerce, Restaurants, and Hotels, (8) Transport and Communications, (9) Financial
    Services, (10) Home Ownership, (11) Personal Services, (12) Public Administration.
    The analysis uses RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 scenarios.
  15: The paper notes potential biases with very optimistic or pessimistic forecasts
    depending on model coefficients applied.
  16: The study focuses on the impact of climate change on various industries in Chile,
    including Agriculture and Forestry, Fishing, Mining, Manufacturing, EGA, Construction,
    Commerce, Restaurants, and Hotels, Transport and Communications, Financial Services,
    Home Ownership, Personal Services, and Public Administration.
  17: The study acknowledges that unavailability of regional-industry GDP data at
    a quarterly or monthly frequency makes statistical identification harder. The
    fraction of GDP represented by economically affected sectors falls over time,
    limiting the impact of climate change on GDP.

Quantitative material:
  1: One Celsius degree increase in January implies a 3% and 12% GDP reduction in
    Agriculture and Fishing, respectively. Chilean GDP would fall between -14.8% and
    -9% in 2050 and between -29.6% and -16.8% in 2100.
  2: Each Celsius degree of temperature increase in January implies a GDP reduction
    of 3% for the Agriculture sector and 12% for the Fishing sector.
  3: "Uses regional-industry level GDP series for Chile over the period 1985\u2013\
    2017; Presents fraction (%) of the value of each industry in national GDP (1985\u2013\
    2017) for 12 industries; Metropolitan Region of Santiago represents around 40%\
    \ of national GDP and population."
  5: "Table 2 shows the fraction (%) of the value of each industry for the GDP of\
    \ each region in Chile (1985\u20132017). For example, Agriculture and Forestry\
    \ accounts for 0.1% of the GDP in Region I, and 13.3% of the GDP in Region XIV.\
    \ Mining accounts for 37.1% of the GDP in Region I, and 2.7% of the GDP in Region\
    \ XV."
  6: "Mean precipitation has been falling in the Central, South and Metropolitan macrozones.\
    \ Mean temperatures have been increasing across all the macrozones. There are\
    \ fluctuations in precipitation and temperature between 1950\u20131959, 1980\u2013\
    1989 and 2010\u20132017. The mean precipitation weighted by surface area decreased\
    \ substantially between 1950\u20131959 and 1980\u20131989 and also decreased slightly\
    \ between 1980\u20131980 and 2010\u20132017."
  7: Decreases in maximum and mean precipitation across all macrozones (except the
    North) between 1950-1959 and 1980-1989, and again between 1980-1980 and 2010-2017,
    with and without GDP region weights.
  8: Table 3 provides quantitative data on changes in precipitation (cm/month) and
    temperature (Celsius) between 1950-1959 & 1980-1989, and 1980-1989 & 2010-2017
    for Chile and its macrozones (North, Central, South, Metro), weighted by regional
    surface area and regional GDP in 2017, including minimum, maximum, and mean values
  9: The model uses log GDP growth as the dependent variable, influenced by weather
    variables like average temperature and precipitation.
  10: Table 4 presents coefficients for the impact of temperature and precipitation
    on regional industry GDP.
  12: "Yes, GDP growth rate impacts for each industry under temperature increase of\
    \ 1\xB0C are provided, such as -3% for Agriculture, -12.1% for Fishing, and so\
    \ on."
  13: "Simulated impact (in %) of climate change on industry, overall GDP, and growth\
    \ rates in Chile for 1985\u20132017 and future years (2050 and 2100) under different\
    \ temperature increases."
  14: "Table 8 provides quantitative estimates of the impact of climate change on\
    \ GDP growth rate in 2017 and GDP level in 2050 and 2100 under various temperature\
    \ increase scenarios. For example, a 1.0\xB0C temperature increase could result\
    \ in a -2.3% impact on GDP level in 2050. Table 9 shows the same variables with\
    \ negative values"
  15: Predicted changes in GDP for different scenarios including declines between
    0.8% or less, and specific industry impacts such as Construction decline between
    12.7% and 23.8%.
  16: Table 10 and 11 provide simulated impact (in %) of climate change on industry
    and overall GDP level and growth rates in Chile for the future under different
    temperature increase scenarios.
  17: Each additional Celsius degree of temperature decreases GDP by -3% in Agriculture,
    -8.8% in Fishing, -2.2% in Manufacturing, -3.9% in Energy-Gas-Water, -0.3% in
    Construction, and -0.7% in Commerce (considering only statistically significant
    coefficients). Projections for GDP impact in 2050 range from -2.3% to +0.4% and
    in 2100 range from +3.2% to +193.2% (using only statistically significant coefficients).
