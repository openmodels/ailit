Drivers of Risk:
  2: Assets exposed to flood hazards are growing through rapid land-use change, urbanisation,
    and economic expansion.
  3: Flooding driven by increasing climatic extremes such as intensive precipitation.
  4: Flooding from sewers, groundwater, and non-main rivers.
  5: Mentions that severe flooding is regularly experienced in the USA and highlights
    tropical cyclones as a driver of risk, which can enhance riverine floods through
    extreme precipitation and storm surges.
  6: Increased flood risk in coastal areas due to high demand for development land
    and climate change.
  7: "The 1993 Mississippi River flood, which flooded over 1200km of the river\u2019\
    s length and about 840000km2 in area."
  8: Increased intensive rainfall events (> 50mm/h and > 100mm/h) in Japan, typhoons,
    torrential rains, snowmelt, tsunami. Sprawling development in Houston leading
    to loss of wetland storage and expansion of impermeable surfaces.
  9: Floods and heavy rainstorms are identified as key drivers impacting flood risk
    and resilience in Japan.
  10: Fluvial floods, future climate projection (precipitation ratio and discharge
    ratio under lower, middle, and upper climate scenarios for 2080-2100)
  11: Floods
  12: Rising flood hazards from climate change, including more frequent storms and
    intensive rainfall, are impacting outcomes.
  13: Urban floods due to fast urbanisation and land-use changes in coastal cities.
  14: Climate change is raising sea levels, making storm surges more hazardous, and
    is increasing the frequency of floods.
  15: Increased flood risk due to climate change impacts such as severe storms, sea
    surges, and intense rainfall, coupled with urban development and past land-use
    planning decisions.
Evaluation overview:
  2: "Flood damage \u2013 whether human or material \u2013 is growing rapidly."
  5: Discusses flood-related mortality and economic losses in the USA, including an
    average of 87 deaths per year from flooding and 29 billion-dollar flood events
    between 1989 and 2018.
  8: This page discusses flood risk management and its effectiveness in the USA and
    Japan.
  9: The paper discusses the outcomes of flood risk management strategies, including
    reduced flood fatalities and ongoing high economic losses due to flooding in Japan.
  10: No relevant information
  11: Flood risk management is evaluated across four countries.
  15: The paper evaluates the financial and practical sustainability of existing flood
    risk management approaches in Asian coastal megacities.
Highlights:
  3: Flood management has evolved from solely flood defense to include flood risk
    management, balancing risk reduction with other priorities and engaging stakeholders
    to identify multidisciplinary solutions.
  4: UK flood policy seeks to integrate FRM with land-use planning, considering future
    development and flood risk, which addresses social, economic, and environmental
    criteria.
  5: Notes that major damage and mortalities are associated with tropical cyclones
    like Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, Harvey, Irma, and Maria, as well as significant
    Midwest flooding in 1993, 2008, and 2019.
  7: The 1993 Mississippi River flood led to a review of flood management approaches,
    eventually leading to the Galloway Report which proposed that development in the
    floodplain should be avoided unless no alternative locations existed.
  9: The paper highlights legislative improvements and shifts in flood risk management
    strategy in Japan, emphasizing integrated and sustainable approaches.
  10: SFRM progresses from flood control to FRM (Flood Risk Management) and now towards
    SFRM. SFRM considers social, economic, and environmental factors, including natural
    capital, in flood mitigation.
  11: Highlights strengths and weaknesses of flood risk management practices across
    four countries related to social justice, flood information, cost-benefit analysis,
    flood infrastructure investment, and flood insurance.
  12: The complexity of governance in flood risk management is highlighted, with the
    USA noted for having local authorities take the lead role.
  13: Singapore adopted a low-impact development approach in the 1990s and launched
    the ABC Waters Programme to address climate change.
  14: Coastal cities experienced more floods in the last 2 decades, bringing greater
    urgency for governments to progress and consider wider socio-economic and environmental
    pillars in flood risk management.
  15: The paper highlights the need for Asian coastal cities to adopt sustainable
    flood risk management (SFRM) strategies, including both engineered and non-engineered
    measures, to cope with increasing flood risks.
Methodology:
  3: Analysis includes evaluating flood risk management (FRM) practices through the
    historical evolution of strategies in countries like the UK, focusing on shifts
    from flood defense to flood risk management.
  4: Surface Water Management Plans (SWMPs) are required by the government under the
    Flood and Water Management Act to outline a preferred surface water management
    strategy, assessing flood risk to inform local authority planning decisions.
  5: No relevant information
  10: Discusses sustainable flood risk management (SFRM) evolution, driven by sustainability
    principles (social, economic, environmental). Mentions participatory planning
    aided by flood risk information. Includes cost-benefit analysis considering economic,
    social, and environmental factors.
  11: Comparison of flood risk management practices across four countries (Japan,
    Netherlands, UK, USA).
More Notes:
  5: No relevant information
  6: Mentions the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and Executive Order 11988 Floodplain
    Management. Discusses the shift from flood control to flood management in the
    USA.
  8: The page emphasizes the need for better planning and coordination between different
    levels of government in the USA and highlights the historical lack of coordination
    in flood management policy in Japan.

    and sustainable flood risk management in a broader context including The Netherlands,
    the UK, and the United States.

Quantitative material:
  4: Forecast flood damage in England and Wales is expected to rise to as much as
    GBP27 billion by 2100.
  5: 'Provides quantitative information on flood impacts in the USA: an average of
    87 deaths per year and 29 billion-dollar floods (excluding tropical cyclones)
    between 1989 and 2018, with an average event cost of USD 4.3 million.'
  6: US census projects an additional 82 million residents by 2030, an increase of
    29% of the current population in coastal areas.
  7: Over USD15 billion in economic damage resulting from the 1993 Mississippi River
    flood.
  8: In the USA, approximately 50% of properties in the designated 100-year floodplain
    have flood insurance. The NFIP has paid more than USD 51 billion in flood claims
    since 1978. In Japan, intensive rainfall events (> 50mm/h) have increased in frequency
    by about 50% and those > 100mm/h have more than doubled over the last 30 years.
    In 2000, pluvial flooding in Nagoya caused about JYP 978 billion (ca. USD 9.57
    billion) in economic losses. In 2004, the Niigata-Fukushima flood inundated 26000
    properties.
