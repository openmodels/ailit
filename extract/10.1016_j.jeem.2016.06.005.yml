  6: Weather variations (temperature and precipitation) and climate-induced yield
    shocks.
  7: Temperature and precipitation of origin countries, agricultural dependence of
    origin countries, lagged GDP per capita for both origin and destination countries.
  8: Temperature rise impacts agricultural countries by inducing outmigration.
  10: Temperature changes.
  11: Changes in cereal yields (an indicator of agricultural productivity), which
    are in turn influenced by temperature and precipitation.

  17: Adverse climate factors (C) affecting agricultural productivity (A) and expected
    amenities (p) in the farming country (FC).
  27: Temperature and precipitation changes in the origin country (country i) impacting
    international migration.
  28: Temperature increases, agricultural dependence.
  29: Temperature, Precipitation, Interaction of Temperature and Agriculture, Interaction
    of Precipitation and Agriculture

Highlights:
  1: No relevant information
  6: Agriculture is an important intermediate link between climate and international
    migration. Climate-induced yield shocks lead to outmigration, particularly in
    agricultural countries.
  7: Adverse climate change (specifically temperature increases) triggers more outmigration
    from agriculture-dependent countries.
  8: Main outcome is that agricultural countries are more likely to experience outmigration
    when temperature rises.
  10: Positive temperature effects on outmigration from agricultural countries are
    only detected in the migration routes to their top 25% migration destination countries.
  11: Cereal yields are negatively associated with outmigration only in the top 25%
    agricultural countries. Unobserved omitted variables jointly determining cereal
    yields and migration would bias the OLS estimates towards zero.
  16: No relevant information
  17: Adverse climate factors decrease agricultural productivity and expected amenities
    in FC, which leads to outmigration from FC. The magnitude of outmigration depends
    on the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity and amenities, the
    productivity of the non-agricultural sector, and labor's output elasticity.
  27: Temperature, especially when interacted with agricultural dependence, has a
    statistically significant positive impact on the international migration rate.
  28: The interaction between temperature and agricultural dependence is a statistically
    significant driver of migration flows, as shown by the coefficients and significance
    levels in the table. The effect is robust to several alternative specifications
    and control variables.
  29: Temperature and Precipitation interact with Agriculture to affect migration
    patterns differently depending on the size of migration flows between origin and
    destination countries.
  31: Cereal yield has a statistically significant negative impact on the outcome
    of interest. The coefficient is consistently negative and statistically significant
    across various robustness checks.
  34: Countries more dependent on agriculture (column 4) have lower GDP per capita,
    lower cereal yields, higher monthly mean temperature, higher monthly total precipitation
    and a much higher percentage of agriculture value added in GDP than countries
    less dependent on agriculture (column 1).
  35: Temperature has a statistically significant negative impact on cereal yields
    in agriculture-dependent countries (columns 2, 3, and 4). Precipitation has a
    statistically significant positive impact on cereal yields in the most agriculture-dependent
    countries (column 4).
Methodology:
  1: No relevant information
  6: Reduced-form model linking origin country weather variations to international
    outmigration, controlling for income and other factors. Instrumental variables
    approach to estimate the yield-migration relationship, using temperature and precipitation
    as instruments for cereal yields. Panel data analysis covering 42 OECD destination
    countries and 163 origin countries over the period of 1980-2010.
  7: Reduced-form regression analysis with country-pair fixed effects and origin and
    destination country specific linear time trends. The model examines the relationship
    between migration rates and contemporaneous temperature and precipitation, agricultural
    dependence, and lagged GDP per capita.
  8: Robustness checks using different control variables, regression techniques, dependent
    and independent variables, and sample thresholds for defining agricultural countries.
  10: The authors use regression analysis, including Two-Stage Least Squares Regression,
    and split the sample into quartiles based on destination country popularity.
  11: Fixed-effects two-stage least-squares (FE-2SLS) using temperature and precipitation
    as instruments for cereal yields. Applicable to countries categorized based on
    agricultural dependence.
  16: A theoretical model is presented where people migrate from a fictitious country
    (FC) to the rest-of-the-world (ROTW) based on wage levels and non-pecuniary utility.
    The model includes a production function that depends on labor force (population),
    capital, and productivity in agricultural and non-agricultural sectors.
  17: Derives an equation (Eq. 6) for the change in outmigration (dN/dC) with respect
    to climate change based on a model where wage is determined by the marginal productivity
    of labor. Uses first order conditions and derivatives to analyze the relationship
    between climate change, agricultural productivity, amenities, and outmigration
    from a farming country (FC).
  27: The analysis uses a reduced-form regression model with country-pair fixed effects
    and origin/destination country-specific linear time trends. Robust standard errors
    are clustered by country pairs.
  28: 'Reduced-form model, panel data regression, robustness checks involving controlling
    for lagged temperature/precipitation, migration stocks/rates, country-specific
    time trends, and fixed effects. Uses different definitions of agriculture-dependent
    countries (top 33%, 25%, 20%). Robust standard errors clustered by country pairs. '
  29: Regression analysis with country-pair fixed effects and destination/origin country-specific
    linear time trends; Sample split into quartiles based on migration stock from
    each origin to destination country; Robust standard errors clustered by country
    pairs
  31: The analysis uses instrumental variables (IV) regressions, specifically FE-2SLS
    and FE-LIML, to estimate the impact of cereal yields. Robustness checks include
    using temperature or precipitation as sole instruments, using lagged variables,
    controlling for GDP per capita, using the natural logarithm of migration flows,
    and restricting the sample to the top agricultural countries.
  34: Countries are divided into four equal-sized groups based on the share of agriculture
    value added in GDP (lower quartile, median, and upper quartile). Summary statistics
    are provided for each group and for all countries.
  35: Regression analysis with robust standard errors clustered by country. Countries
    are divided into four groups based on the share of agriculture value added in
    GDP (lower quartile, median, and upper quartile).
More Notes:
  1: No relevant information
  6: Agricultural dependence is defined as a dummy variable, where the top 25% agriculture-dependent
    countries are assigned with 1. Agriculture-dependent countries are defined as
    those with a relatively high share of agriculture value added in GDP.
  7: The study distinguishes between agricultural and non-agricultural countries in
    their response to climate change. The paper models motivations for migration,
    which *potentially* inform projections of long-term climate change impacts.
  8: Temperature has both contemporaneous and lagged effects on migration; migration
    may be influenced by existing ethnic networks.
  10: The authors control for precipitation as a possible confounding factor. The
    paper implies that temperature tends to intensify migration mostly in the already
    established migration routes.
  11: Weak instrument concern because F-statistics are less than 10, although the
    rule of thumb may not be as relevant here due to the use of robust standard errors
    clustered at the country level.
  16: The paper appears to be setting up a migration model within a small open economy
    framework, likely to explore how environmental factors (potentially impacting
    agricultural productivity) could influence migration and overall economic output.
    The connection to climate change adaptation is not explicit on this page, but
    is implied through the impact on agricultural productivity.
  17: The model simplifies by assuming climate only directly affects the agricultural
    sector. In reality, climate change may have effects on non-agricultural sectors.
    The paper also assumes a competitive labor market.
  27: The paper focuses on the impact of climate variables on international migration,
    not directly on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. The 'Agriculture' variable is
    a dummy indicating high agriculture-dependent countries. The model controls for
    GDP per capita in both origin and destination countries.
  28: The dependent variable is migration flows, and the table focuses on the impact
    of temperature increases in agriculture-dependent countries on these flows. Some
    specifications use the natural logarithm of migration flows as the dependent variable.
    The paper examines origin and destination countries.
  29: Lagged GDP per capita is included as a control variable
  31: The coefficients are reported for the most agriculture-dependent countries,
    and the robustness checks in Panels A-E are based on the top 25% agricultural
    countries.
  34: Outmigration is higher in countries with both the lowest and highest agriculture
    dependence (columns 1 and 3). This suggests a non-linear relationship between
    agricultural dependence and outmigration, but this is not explicitly explored
    in the paper.
  35: The table presents first-stage results. The dependent variable is the natural
    logarithm of cereal yields.

  12: This page focuses on the relationship between weather, cereal yields, and migration,
    without explicitly linking these to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes at a national
    level or estimating the costs/benefits of adaptation.
  33: This page focuses on migration patterns and characteristics of agricultural
    vs. non-agricultural countries. It does not directly address macroeconomic or
    macro-fiscal risks of climate change, nor does it provide cost-benefit analyses
    of adaptation at a national level.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  6: Indirectly, outmigration from countries is considered as an outcome, which could
    affect the labor supply and productivity in both origin and destination countries.
  7: Migration rate (migration flow from one origin country to one destination country
    divided by the origin country population).
  8: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes related to GDP, productivity, or
    public finance are discussed on this page.
  11: International outmigration.

    capita (2005 US dollar), Cereal yields (Kilogram per hectare), Percentage of agriculture,
    value added in GDP
  35: Cereal yields (specifically, the natural logarithm of cereal yields)
Quantitative material:
  1: No relevant information
  6: The effect of temperature on outmigration is positive and statistically significant
    only in the most agriculture-dependent countries. Outmigration is highly responsive
    to climate-induced yield shocks, but only in agricultural countries.
  7: "1\xB0C increase in temperature implies a 5% increase in outmigration from the\
    \ top 25% agricultural countries (significant at the 1% level), as compared to\
    \ only 0.4% increase (statistically insignificant) in outmigration from the non-agricultural\
    \ countries."
  8: Differential temperature effects become larger and more statistically significant
    as the threshold for identifying agricultural countries increases (33%, 25%, 20%).
  11: Estimated elasticity of outmigration rate with respect to cereal yields in the
    top 25% agricultural countries is about -2.4. For a country with 0.1% annual outmigration
    rate, a 10% reduction in cereal yields would raise the annual outmigration rate
    by around 24%, or to 0.124%.
  16: No relevant information
  27: Table presents regression coefficients showing the impact of temperature and
    precipitation on the natural logarithm of migration rate. For example, in Model
    2, a 1-unit increase in temperature, interacted with agriculture dependence, increases
    the log migration rate by 0.047 (p<0.01).
  28: The table provides coefficient estimates for the interaction term between temperature
    and agricultural dependence on migration flows, along with standard errors and
    significance levels for various specifications. The coefficient values range from
    approximately 0.005 to 0.079 depending on the model specification.
  29: Temperature coefficient ranges from -0.001 to 0.019; Temperature x Agriculture
    coefficient ranges from -0.007 to 0.063; Precipitation coefficient ranges from
    -0.001 to 0.001; Precipitation x Agriculture coefficient ranges from 0.001 to
    0.002; Adjusted R-squared ranges from 0.8855 to 0.9302

    yields, Percentage of agriculture, value added in GDP, Monthly mean temperature,
    and Monthly total precipitation for four country groups and all countries, with
    standard deviations.
  35: The table provides coefficients for Temperature and Precipitation on cereal
    yields, standard errors, number of observations, number of countries, adjusted
    R-squared, F statistics, and p-values.
