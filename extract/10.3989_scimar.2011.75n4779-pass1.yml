Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate variability, economic pressures, inadequate management, and globalized
    trade system.
  4: Decline in the supply of a distant production system; Market dynamics; Climate
    dynamics; Socioeconomic changes impacting fisheries; Environmental fluctuations;
    Demand for marine commodities; Fluctuations in market conditions; Fishing cost.
  5: Increase in demand for marine commodities; Climate perturbations occurring simultaneously
    with demand expansion destabilize the global network.
  6: Increase in demand for marine commodities, market equilibrium dynamics, and climatic
    perturbations are modeled as key drivers.
  8: Increased demand for marine commodities, environmental (production) fluctuations,
    and negative climatic signals (modeled through a normal distribution) drive the
    simulated changes in fisheries.
  9: "Synergies between global markets and regional climate can trigger a sequential\
    \ overexploitation and collapse of resources; Climate change and environmental\
    \ oscillations can produce fluctuations in fisheries production; Economic globalization\
    \ can lead to sequential exploitation, overexploitation and collapse of the world\u2019\
    s fisheries."
  11: Climate change affecting fisheries, environmental conditions affecting fish
    stocks, economic globalization, rising demand for marine products, regional climate-induced
    variability.
Highlights:
  1: "A combination of climate-induced variability in fish population production,\
    \ particular patterns of demand for fish products and inadequate management can\
    \ drive the world\u2019s fisheries into development, overexploitation, collapse\
    \ and recovery phases."
  4: The simulation explains different phases that interconnected fisheries go through,
    showing how increasing demand for marine commodities impacts price-to-cost ratios
    and drives fisheries through different stages. Fluctuations in market conditions
    cause variability in fleet activity and yield.
  5: Under MSY regulation and biological equilibrium, stocks are prevented from reaching
    overexploitation, unless destabilized by climate events and demand pressures.
  6: MSY regulation prevents stocks from reaching overexploitation under conditions
    of biological equilibrium; Negative climatic perturbations can drive fully exploited
    stocks into overexploitation, especially when producers are economically motivated
    to reach catch limits.
  8: The simulation suggests that a globalized economic system can mask negative trends
    in local fisheries through the development of new fisheries, leading to an apparent
    stable global production before sequential collapses become obvious.
  9: Synergies between global markets and regional climate can trigger a sequential
    overexploitation and collapse of resources. Adaptive regulation systems can cope
    with synergies between markets and natural fluctuations in fish stock abundance.
  11: Adaptive management measures were effective in avoiding the risk of collapse
    of fully exploited stocks, even when they were negatively affected by environmental
    conditions.
Methodology:
  1: Global bioeconomic model to explore the synergistic effects of climate variability,
    economic pressures and management measures; considers development, overexploitation,
    collapse and recovery phases of fisheries.
  4: A bioeconomic network model simulates how market and climate dynamics interact,
    considering different phases of fisheries development (pre-development, growth,
    full exploitation, overexploitation, and recovery/collapse). The model parameterization
    simplifies by assuming identical biological terms and technical capacities for
    all stocks, with distance from the global market being the differentiating factor
    determining fishing cost. Two alternative management scenarios are considered.
  5: Modelling of global fisheries with MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield) criteria;
    Simulations of demand increase and climate perturbations.
  6: The analysis uses a 150-year simulation model of global fisheries driven by demand,
    managed using MSY criteria, and subjected to climatic perturbations.
  8: The study uses a simulation model of global fisheries, incorporating market equilibrium,
    adaptive management strategies, and environmental factors, simulating fisheries
    dynamics over 150 years.
  9: Simulations are used to model the impact of climate change and globalization
    on fisheries, with scenarios involving adaptive regulation systems and different
    market conditions.
  11: A model introduces an adaptive management scheme that sets quotas periodically
    using yearly fish stock assessments. The model also compares a simplistic, highly
    inefficient management scenario to a perfect adaptive management one.
More Notes:
  1: The paper models sequential patterns of overexploitation emerging from the interaction
    between regional environmental fluctuations and a globalized trade system and
    argues that this situation is avoidable through adaptive management measures.
  4: The model uses simplifying assumptions such as identical biological parameters
    and technical capacities across fish stocks to make the simulation tractable.
    The model uses equilibrium MSY limits for regulation.
  5: The model simulates the interactions of ten fisheries, indicating their performance
    individually and cumulatively towards stable conditions.
  6: The model simulates the interplay between economic incentives (demand), resource
    management (MSY), and external shocks (climate) in determining fisheries outcomes;
    The model suggests that when negative climatic impacts are combined with high
    demand, single stocks can be driven to overexploitation.
  8: The collapse of a fishery increases pressure on other stocks through market equilibrium
    conditions. The model uses adaptative management to drive stocks to B_MSY levels.
  9: The model considers the impact of price-to-cost ratio on fishing effort. Exploiters
    are assumed to maximize short-term economic return rather than sustainable economic
    yield. The model assumes perfect knowledge of the system.
  11: The paper suggests that economic globalization allows fisheries to be understood
    as a common issue, which should therefore be managed following international agreements.
