Drivers of Risk:
  1: Annual temperature shocks impacting TFP growth rates.
  2: Weather variability; climate change; hot temperatures; labour supply; capital
    depreciation; productivity
  3: Climate change impacts altering total factor productivity growth and the assumptions
    about such impacts in Integrated Assessment Models.
  5: Climate change (temperature changes), Emission abatement costs
  6: Climate change impacts, specifically the fraction of impacts harming TFP growth
    (fA)
  7: Temperature changes, precipitation variability
  8: Annual temperature change and annual change in precipitation levels
  9: Temperature shocks and variations affecting TFP.
  10: Annual changes in temperature and precipitation
  11: Temperature shocks
  12: Temperature shocks are identified as a driver of risk.
  13: "Annual changes in temperature (\u0394Temp) and precipitation (\u0394Pre)"
  14: Temperature shocks (Delta1Temp) and changes in precipitation (Delta1Pre) are
    the key drivers of risk.
  15: "Annual changes in temperature (Delta1Temp) in \xB0C, annual changes in precipitation\
    \ (Delta1Pre) in units of 100 mm per year."
  16: "Temperature changes (\u0394Temp)."
  17: Temperature shocks (positive and negative shocks to annual temperature), especially
    in poor countries; Weather shocks
  18: Temperature changes (Delta1Temp), precipitation changes (Delta1Pre).
  19: Average warming by the end of the century.
  20: Temperature shocks
  21: Temperature shocks, poverty.
Highlights:
  1: Negative temperature impact on TFP growth is significant only in poor countries,
    not in rich countries.
  2: Climate change may affect labour supply, capital depreciation and productivity
    (rather than productivity growth).
  5: Climate impacts can affect long-run economic growth as climate change reduces
    current output, savings, and investment. Climate change can also affect TFP, which
    can substantially alter the impacts.
  6: A small share of climate change impacts affecting TFP can lead to radically different
    consumption growth paths. Climate change impacts on TFP permanently reduce future
    output possibilities.
  7: There is a negative correlation between TFP and temperature levels in 2006. This
    correlation is not a causal relationship.
  8: The study investigates the impact of temperature and precipitation shocks on
    TFP growth, controlling for country and region-time fixed effects. The model also
    addresses the potential for omitted variable bias and over-controlling.
  9: Temperature variations affect TFP growth, with negative impacts concentrated
    in poor countries.
  10: Temperature shocks significantly negatively affect TFP growth rates in poor
    countries. The negative impact of temperature on TFP is concentrated in countries
    with below-median GDP per capita.
  11: Temperature shocks have a negative impact on the TFP growth rate of poor countries.
    There is weak evidence of a negative impact of temperature shocks in hot countries.
  12: Temperature shocks have different impacts across countries depending on income
    levels; these dynamics indicate a linear function is a good approximation for
    this dataset.
  13: Temperature and precipitation changes significantly impact TFP growth. The impact
    of temperature change may be non-linear. The impact of temperature change on TFP
    growth may be different in poor and hot countries.
  14: "The impact of temperature shocks on TFP growth is non-linear. The negative\
    \ impact of temperature shocks on TFP growth may diminish as countries grow richer.\
    \ The marginal effect of a 1\xB0C annual increase becomes zero when income is\
    \ approximately $34,400 per person per year for countries classified as \u201C\
    hot\u201D, approximately $14,900 per person per year for countries not classified\
    \ as \u201Chot\u201D, and approximately $25,600 per person per year for the sample\
    \ as a whole."
  15: Temperature increases have a negative impact on TFP growth, especially in poor
    countries. Higher GDP per capita levels can reduce the negative impact of temperature
    shocks on TFP growth rate.
  16: The effect of temperature change on the 'Effects on Linear Prediction' is less
    negative (more positive) as the natural logarithm of GDP per capita increases.
  17: Temperature shocks have a negative and significant impact on TFP growth and
    labour productivity growth, but only in poor countries.
  18: Temperature increases have a negative impact on labor productivity growth, particularly
    in poor countries. Precipitation changes also have a negative impact on labor
    productivity growth. The total effect of temperature change on labor productivity
    growth in poor countries is estimated to be -1.627 percentage points (column 1).
  19: Climate change will decrease TFP growth, but the effect is much larger in poor
    countries. The negative impacts on TFP disappear once a certain income threshold
    is reached ($34,400).
  20: Finds a negative relationship between TFP growth and temperature shocks only
    in poor countries. The estimated temperature effect on TFP growth probably explains
    the effect on economic growth found in previous papers, and is probably explained
    by temperature effects on labour productivity. Empirical evidence suggests persistence
    of impacts in poor countries.
  21: TFP growth rates of poor countries are affected by temperature shocks.
Methodology:
  1: "Analysis of the relationship between annual temperature shocks and TFP growth\
    \ rates using macro TFP data from the Penn World Table during the period 1960\u2013\
    2006."
  2: Econometric evidence of the impact of weather and climate on total factor productivity
    growth.
  3: The paper estimates the impact of weather variability and climate change on TFP
    growth, distinguishing it from various cross-section analyses, which face challenges
    of endogeneity and confounders.
  5: "Uses a Ramsey\u2013Cass\u2013Koopmans growth model (specifically the DICE model)\
    \ with an added climate externality and emission abatement costs to show how climate\
    \ change could affect technological progress."
  6: Partitioning damages between output and TFP using equations (5) and (6). Uses
    Real Total Factor Productivity from National Accounts data (RTFPNA) from Penn
    World Table 8.1 to study within-country productivity growth over time. Annual
    RTFPNA growth rates are calculated by first-differencing.
  7: The study uses data from 1960-2006 for 60 countries. Temperature and precipitation
    data are first-differenced to ensure stationary residuals in regressions. Population
    weights are used to aggregate temperature data.
  8: Fixed-effects panel regression model used to isolate the impact of weather shocks
    on TFP growth.
  9: Baseline specification includes annual changes in temperature and precipitation
    levels, with interaction terms for poverty and heat.
  10: Panel regression analysis with country fixed effects and Region x Time fixed
    effects. The sample period seems to be implicitly (1960-2006) as stated further
    down.
  11: Regression analysis with various robustness checks, including different datasets,
    interaction terms, and specifications for poor/rich and hot countries. Use of
    Driscoll and Kraay (1998) standard errors and clustered standard errors. Investigation
    of persistence of temperature effects through the inclusion of lags in the regressions;
    five different sensitivity tests to check for robustness with respect to climatic
    data and functional forms of the weather variables.
  12: The analysis involves interacting temperature changes with average temperature
    and GDP per capita to capture potential non-linearities, and examining differences
    in development and institutional contexts.
  13: The analysis uses panel regressions with country fixed effects and Region x
    Time fixed effects to estimate the impact of temperature and precipitation changes
    on annual TFP growth.  The regressions control for income level (Poor, Poor_2)
    and average temperature (Hot, Hot_2). Standard errors are clustered at the country
    level.
  14: The analysis uses regression models with country fixed effects and Region x
    Time fixed effects to assess the impact of temperature and precipitation on TFP
    growth. The temperature impacts are explored non-linearly using temperature bins
    (Cold, Mild, Warm, Hot) as dummy variables. Standard errors are clustered at the
    country level.
  15: "Panel regression analysis with country fixed effects and Region \xD7 Time fixed\
    \ effects. The models use annual TFP growth rate as the dependent variable and\
    \ include interaction terms with variables like GDP per capita and Polity2 (measure\
    \ of institutional quality). Standard errors are clustered at the country level."
  16: Regression analysis interacting temperature changes with GDP per capita levels
    and institutional quality (Polity2 measure) to assess the relationship between
    climate, institutions, and development.
  17: Regression analysis using annual TFP growth and annual labour productivity growth
    as dependent variables. Data on labour productivity obtained from Penn World Table
    (PWT 8.1).
  18: Panel regression analysis with country fixed effects and Region x Time fixed
    effects. The sample consists of 2760 observations. Models include interaction
    terms for temperature change with dummy variables for poor countries (below median
    GDP per capita in 1960) and hot countries (above median average temperature in
    the 1960s).
  19: Projections of future warming were used in conjunction with benchmark estimates
    to predict the impact of future warming on TFP growth. Short-run semi-elasticity
    is estimated rather than the long-run one. Extrapolation is used.
  20: Panel data analysis using first differences of TFP and temperature levels to
    address non-stationarity and potential long-run growth effects. The relationship
    is tested across alternative samples, data, and specifications, accounting for
    spatial autocorrelation. Focuses on the past relationship between TFP growth rates
    and temperature shocks.
  21: The analysis is based on historical data and statistical methods to assess the
    impact of weather variations on TFP. The external validity with respect to future
    climate change is limited.
More Notes:
  2: Distinguishes between static (level) and dynamic (growth) effects of climate
    change, arguing that growth effects compound over time and permanently reduce
    output.
  5: The paper links macro literature with micro studies on the relationship between
    temperature and human physiology, suggesting labor productivity as a key reason
    behind the impact on TFP growth in poorer countries.
  6: Data are taken from Penn World Table (PWT 8.1).
  8: The paper acknowledges potential measurement errors in TFP due to weather-related
    short-term reallocations of labor and capital.
  11: The paper performs several robustness checks on its findings, presented in the
    online appendix. The paper investigates heterogeneity in the impacts of temperature
    shocks, focusing on climate, levels of development, quality of institutions, and
    composition of TFP.
  12: The paper suggests that temperature impacts are influenced by average income
    rather than just by climate, with heterogeneous impacts in rich versus poor countries.
  13: The variables 'Poor', 'Poor_2', 'Hot', and 'Hot_2' are dummy variables indicating
    whether a country's GDP per capita or average temperature in the 1960s was below
    or above the median, respectively. The results suggest that the impact of weather
    and climate change on macroeconomic outcomes may vary with income levels and climatic
    zones.
  14: The paper uses interaction terms to explore how the relationship between temperature
    and TFP growth changes with average GDP per capita and temperature categories.
  15: The impact of temperature change on TFP growth is dependent on GDP per capita
    and institutional quality (Polity2).
  16: The study uses Polity2 as a measure of institutional quality. The analysis explores
    whether the impact of temperature is mediated through institutional quality.
  17: The negative impact of temperature shocks on TFP growth in poor countries is
    likely due to a larger share of GDP in the agricultural sector, more outdoor work,
    lower adaptive capacity, and the impact on outdoor labour productivity.
  18: The study uses country-specific warming projections for the period 2071-2095
    compared to 1980-2004, based on RCP 8.5.
  19: The results highlight the distributional issues of climate change impacts, confirming
    that poor countries will suffer the most. The estimated effect is smaller than
    hypothesized in other studies. The estimate of a 5.30% reduction in TFP is considered
    an upper bound.
  20: The sample size is limited to less than 70 countries, although they account
    for a large share of world GDP and population. TFP data is the Solow residual
    and potentially affected by measurement error and errors in the specification
    and estimation of the production function.
  21: The analysis suggests that weather shocks affect economic growth through the
    TFP channel only when coupled with poverty. Adaptation, like defensive investment,
    may bias TFP estimates.

Quantitative material:
  1: "A 1 \xB0C increase in annual temperature decreases TFP growth rates by about\
    \ 1.1\u20131.8 percentage points in poor countries."
  2: The average effect size of weather and climate on total factor productivity growth
    is small.
  5: Equations (1), (2), (3), and (4) are provided which model the relationship between
    climate change, output, capital, temperature, emissions, and total factor productivity.
  6: fA=0.05 leads to a 70% drop in consumption per capita in 2300 relative to the
    no climate change case. RTFPNA is a country-specific index of TFP which, in the
    benchmark year, 2005, takes value 1 for all countries.
  7: "The main dataset is composed of 60 countries and covers the period 1960\u2013\
    2006. Average annual TFP growth is about 5%, with a minimum of -56% and a maximum\
    \ of 27%. Annual temperature change mean is very small, extremes between 2 and\
    \ 3 \xB0C. There is a negative correlation between TFP and temperature levels\
    \ in 2006."
  8: Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for TFP growth rate, temperature change,
    precipitation change, and GDP per capita, including mean, variance, standard deviation,
    minimum, maximum, and number of observations.
  9: "1\xB0C annual increase in temperature lowers TFP growth rates of countries by\
    \ 0.49%, and by about 1.5 percentage points in poor countries."
  10: A 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature is associated with a statistically
    significant decrease in TFP growth in poor countries (various specifications show
    reductions of approximately 1.14 to 1.52 percentage points).  A 100mm increase
    in precipitation is associated with a statistically significant decrease in TFP
    growth.
  11: A negative and 5% significant impact of temperature shocks in hot countries,
    with a net effect of about -1 percentage point on the annual TFP growth.
  13: The table presents regression coefficients for the impact of temperature and
    precipitation changes on annual TFP growth rate.  For example, in column (1) a
    1 degree Celsius increase in temperature is associated with a -0.490 percentage
    point change in TFP growth rate (significant at the 5% level). A squared temperature
    change term is also included to test for non-linearity.
  14: Table 4 provides coefficients and standard errors for various temperature and
    GDP per capita interactions with TFP growth. For example, a 1-degree increase
    in temperature (Delta1Temp) has a coefficient of 0.884*** (significant at the
    1% level) in column (1). The interaction term between average temperature and
    Delta1Temp has a coefficient of -0.110*** (significant at the 1% level).
  15: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature is associated with a statistically significant\
    \ (p<0.05) decrease of 0.046 percentage points in TFP growth. In poor countries,\
    \ the total effect of a 1\xB0C increase in temperature on TFP growth is a statistically\
    \ significant (p<0.01) decrease of 1.342 percentage points."
  16: "Graphs showing 'Average Marginal Effects of \u0394Temp with 95% CIs' against\
    \ 'ln of GDP per capita level - Maddison Data'. The graphs show effects on linear\
    \ prediction ranging from -2 to 1 (hot sample graph) and -1.5 to 0.5 (whole sample\
    \ graph)."
  17: "A 0.012 \xB0C/year increase in temperature in poor countries leads to negative\
    \ shocks to the annual TFP growth rate of 0.018% (SE = 0.005%) per year."
  18: Table 6 shows regression results with coefficients indicating the relationship
    between annual labor productivity growth and changes in temperature and precipitation.
    For example, in column (1), a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature is associated
    with a -0.543 percentage point change in annual labor productivity growth (significant
    at the 5% level).
  19: "Average warming in sample countries is 3.912 \xB0C. Climate change will entail\
    \ a decrease of approximately 3 percentage points in TFP growth by 2095. TFP growth\
    \ in poor countries will suffer a reduction of 5.96%, compared to a decrease of\
    \ only 0.11% in rich countries. Annual TFP growth rate in poor countries could\
    \ be reduced by about 0.06% per year. Total factor productivity in poor countries\
    \ would be 5.30% below where it would be without climate change. Negative impacts\
    \ disappear at $34,400 income per capita (for hot countries)."
  20: Climate change would reduce TFP growth by less than 0.1% (upper bound estimate).
  21: The paper estimates short-run semi-elasticity of TFP to weather variations.
