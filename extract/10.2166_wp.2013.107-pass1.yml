Drivers of Risk:
  3: South Asian monsoon system, specifically variations in rainfall patterns affecting
    river flows.
  7: Variability in precipitation and runoff predictions in the Ganges basin due to
    different models and scenarios.
  8: Climate change; historical hydrological conditions.
  9: Climate change impacts on temperature, precipitation, snowmelt, runoff, streamflow,
    and saline intrusion in the Ganges basin.
  13: Higher temperatures and precipitation changes, including shifts in the zero-degree
    isotherm and changes in snow and glacier dynamics.
  16: Projected changes in flow and variability in the Ganges River could create challenges
    for populations in the basin.
  18: Changes in water availability due to climate change affecting hydropower production
    and irrigation. Shifting seasonality of monsoon precipitation.
  20: Climate change (drier vs. wetter GCMs), infrastructure development (different
    types and levels), high flow events.
  21: Climate change impacts (temperature increases, precipitation changes, glacier
    and snow melt, runoff, agricultural impacts), and associated droughts and floods
  22: Temperature, rainfall, and runoff changes in the Ganges basin, modeled using
    16 GCMs for a single (A2) high emissions trajectory. Reduction in snow accumulation
    and melt.
Highlights:
  3: The South Asian monsoon system significantly influences the climate and hydrology
    of the Ganges basin, leading to sharp peaks in river flows during June-August
    and very low flows from January to May.
  4: Climate variability manifests in extreme floods and droughts, impacting lives,
    livelihoods, and economic activities.
  7: The study aims to address the inconsistencies in runoff predictions by exploring
    different scenarios of infrastructure development in the Ganges basin.
  8: The study explores the economic implications of climate change by maximizing
    economic production under different hydrological conditions that correspond to
    GCM projections of future climate change.
  9: The paper explores four infrastructure development scenarios in the Ganges basin
    and their impact on system performance indicators. The development scenarios include
    different combinations of mega dams, smaller hydropower projects, and current
    levels of infrastructure.
  13: Significant variation in projections of precipitation and runoff across GCMs;
    expected temperature increase likely to reduce snowmelt and affect seasonal runoff.
  16: Projected changes in river flows result in varied hydropower and irrigation
    outcomes, with some investments generating less power under most GCMs.
  18: Climate change may lead to either lower or higher water use in irrigation, depending
    on the climate model and infrastructure development scenario. Shifting seasonality
    of monsoon precipitation can affect irrigation water use. Low season flows in
    Bangladesh may increase. GCM's may not adequately simulate monsoon precipitation
    in South Asia.
  20: Infrastructure development generates large economic benefits, particularly from
    energy production. The full set of infrastructures is estimated to cost about
    US$35 billion whereas the total annual benefits range from US$8-10 billion/yr.
    The benefit-cost ratio is positive at social discount rates.
  21: The economic values of water-related resources are sensitive to climate model
    projections and infrastructure scenarios. Variability is highest for irrigation
    water and lowest for flows to the delta.
  22: "Dams could deliver significant energy and dry season water supply benefits\
    \ in the Ganges region, worth US$4\u20138 billion/yr."
Methodology:
  3: Describes historical climatic, physical, and hydrological characteristics of
    the Ganges basin.
  7: The analysis uses a series of basin-wide models including a water systems model
    and an economic optimization model to assess climate change implications in the
    Ganges.
  8: Uses the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) simulation model to simulate hydrology.
    Uses the Ganges Economic Optimization Model (GEOM) to explore economic implications
    of climate change scenarios relative to historical hydrological conditions. GEOM
    is an annual model that maximizes benefits from hydropower production, irrigation,
    and downstream low flow augmentation, as well as reduced damages due to flood
    overflows, subject to constraints. Uses nonlinear optimization techniques in the
    General Algebraic Modeling System. A MIKE-BASIN model was also used to explore
    potential impacts of changes in hydrology and sea level rise on salinity. Models
    of flood extent complement results from the water systems models. Climate projections
    were used to drive the SWAT and GEOM models using a monthly time step.
  9: GCM projections (BCM2.0, CGCM3.1, CM3, MK3.0, CM2, CM2.1, GISS-ER, CM3, CM4,
    MIROC3.2, ECHO-G, ECHAM5, CGCM2, CCSM3, PM1, and HADCM3) are routed through a
    hydrological model to yield river flows, then used in the GEOM to optimize reservoir
    storage, hydropower production, and irrigation withdrawals. The A2 emissions trajectory
    is used, with brief discussion of A1B scenario for 2100 for comparison.
  13: SWAT modeling used to simulate changes in temperature and precipitation effects
    on snowmelt and runoff, assessing future hydrologic changes.
  16: The analysis involves hydrograph modeling, supplementary modeling tools for
    saline progression, and optimization model results for infrastructure scenarios.
  18: Climate models (GCMs) are used to project changes in hydropower production and
    irrigation water use under the A2 emissions scenario for 2050. Optimization models
    are used to simulate water allocation, including groundwater use. The analysis
    is specific to Nepal and Bangladesh, focusing on the Ganges River basin.
  20: Analysis of high flow events, economic modeling of benefits from energy and
    irrigation, calculation of economic net benefits based on costs and benefits and
    discount rates.
  21: Uses GCM projections for the A2 emissions scenario to model optimal water allocations
    and calculate economic values for different infrastructure scenarios ('Existing',
    '3 Mega Dams', 'Small Dams', 'Full').
  22: Estimation of temperature, rainfall, and runoff over the Ganges basin using
    16 globally recognized GCMs for a single (A2) high emissions trajectory. Analysis
    of the value of dams for energy and water supply.
More Notes:
  3: Mentions upstream abstractions in India and Nepal affecting flows at Farakka.
  7: "The models used require more data on rainfall, flows, and water use for improved\
    \ accuracy, but they currently simulate flows at the India\u2013Bangladesh border\
    \ with sufficient accuracy."
  8: The paper mentions a treaty obligation at Farakka that is respected in the model.
    The study did not model glacier melt.
  13: Analysis highlights the complexity and uncertainty in climate projections and
    the hydrologic responses in the Himalayan region.
  18: The study acknowledges that the model might overestimate reduced water availability
    because it assumes historical cropping patterns and does not allow for permanent
    depletion of groundwater. The model allows for the use of groundwater during periods
    of surface water shortage but doesn't account for long-term aquifer depletion.
  21: The analysis focuses on the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) basin, and examines
    the interplay between different water uses (hydropower, irrigation, and environmental
    flows).
