Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature
  3: Annual temperature shocks, long-run temperature levels (climate), and precipitation
    (though evidence is less robust for precipitation).
  6: Annual mean temperature and annual total precipitation at the subnational level
    from 1900-2014 are used as climate variables.
  7: The drivers of risk considered are annual mean temperature, change in annual
    mean temperature, annual total precipitation, and change in annual total precipitation.
  8: "The drivers of risk are annual mean temperature (T) and annual total precipitation\
    \ (P), and their changes (\u0394T and \u0394P). The study also considers lagged\
    \ effects (L)."
  9: "Contemporaneous and lagged temperature changes (\u0394T), temperature levels\
    \ (T), and precipitation levels (P). The study also considers cumulative oil and\
    \ gas extraction, distance to coast/rivers, and altitude."
  10: Annual average temperature change, precipitation, fossil resource extraction,
    distance to coast, distance to navigable rivers, and altitude.
  11: Change in 10-year average weather (temperature and precipitation).
  12: Changes in temperature (T) and precipitation (P).
  13: The primary driver of risk discussed is global warming, with specific attention
    to temperature increases from 2015 to 2099.
  14: "Average warming from now until then was in the order of 3.5 \u25E6C compared\
    \ to a scenario with no additional warming from 2015 to 2019."
  15: Warming will occur under the RCP8-5 scenario.
  16: Temperature increases are identified as impacting global economic outcomes through
    productivity losses.
  17: "Temperature increases (1\xB0C)."
  18: Impact of temperature changes on regional economic output and growth rates.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Economic production; Gross Regional Product (GRP); productivity levels and productivity
    growth
  3: Economic growth, specifically Gross Regional Product (GRP) and GDP.
  6: Evaluates the impact of climate variables on Gross Regional Product (GRP) as
    a measure of economic activity.
  7: The paper evaluates the effect of temperature and precipitation changes on per-capita
    growth rate.
  8: This study evaluates the effect of annual weather changes (temperature and precipitation)
    on annual changes of log Gross Regional Product (GRP).
  9: Impacts of temperature and precipitation changes on Gross Regional Product (GRP).
  10: Regional economic growth
  11: Economic growth (changes in log GRP between two periods).
  12: Effect of changes in long-term climate conditions on the log of Gross Regional
    Product (GRP).
  13: The paper evaluates the impacts of global warming on global resources, specifically
    GDP losses, under different warming scenarios and weighting schemes.
  14: Losses in Gross Regional Product (GRP) in 2099 under a business-as-usual warming
    scenario (RCP-8.5).
  15: Discusses GRP losses in 2099 under a business-as-usual warming scenario and
    changes in social cost of carbon.
  16: The paper examines the impact of temperature changes on global GDP and evaluates
    social costs of carbon emissions.
  17: GRP (Gross Regional Product) losses due to temperature increases.
  18: Evaluates economic impact of climate change, specifically on economic output
    and productivity.
Highlights:
  1: Temperature affects productivity levels considerably; impacts are larger in tropical
    and poor regions; no evidence for permanent growth rate impacts
  3: GRP responds to annual temperature shocks and long-run temperature levels. Hot
    regions are more strongly affected by further warming than cooler regions.
  7: The effect of precipitation changes on GRP is largely insignificant across all
    model variants. There is a significant negative effect of a temperature increase
    on GRP.
  8: "The study finds evidence for direct productivity effects of temperature shocks.\
    \ A temperature increase of 1\xB0C in a hot region (25\xB0C) decreases GRP by\
    \ about 3%. There's an optimal annual average temperature level between 5\xB0\
    C and 10\xB0C."
  9: Preferred model (5) reports higher marginal effects of temperature increases
    on GRP than Burke et al. (2015). No evidence found for persistent growth effects.
    Long-difference regressions do not provide evidence for long-run growth effects
    of climate conditions. No evidence found that a change in 10-year average temperature
    affects growth.
  10: Temperature increases reduce GRP, with a 2-4% reduction per degree Celsius.
    Precipitation is not significant. Fossil resource extraction increases GRP, while
    distance to coast, distance to navigable rivers, and altitude reduce GRP.
  11: "Non-linear relationship between GRP and climate, with regions with hot climate\
    \ tending to have lower GRP. U-shaped pattern for precipitation, implying high\
    \ GRP in very dry and very wet regions. Example: in regions with an average temperature\
    \ of 20-24\xB0C, GRP is approximately 28% lower than in the reference temperature\
    \ bin. In regions with 24\xB0C -28\xB0C, the difference amounts to 35% lower gross\
    \ regional product."
  12: Temperature changes have a statistically significant negative impact on GRP
    in most periods. Precipitation coefficients are mostly insignificant. Future GRP
    losses are projected under a business-as-usual scenario, with losses of about
    6-8% at the end of the century using cross-sectional estimates, and 11-14% using
    panel estimates.
  13: Panel models suggest larger global GDP damages than cross-sectional models,
    with heterogeneity in impacts where poorer and hotter regions are disproportionately
    affected.
  14: Damages here are a quadratic function of the warming level and they depend on
    the initial temperature level Ti,0 in region i because marginal damages differ
    among hot and cold regions in the panel regression.
  15: "Optimal carbon price in 2020 is nearly four times higher than earlier assessments;\
    \ Damage functions suggest considerably higher damages than those in the DICE\
    \ model for up to 9\xB0C warming."
  16: SCC estimates are significantly higher than Nordhaus (2018) due to inclusion
    of direct total factor productivity impacts.
  17: Projected losses are about twice as large when computed based on panel regression
    estimates instead of cross-sectional, suggesting short-term weather shocks have
    a larger effect on economic output than long-term climate changes, possibly due
    to adaptation. Technological change has not reduced temperature sensitivity. Panel
    estimates imply damages that are high compared to damage functions in integrated
    assessment models.
  18: "Permanent temperature increase leads to permanent economic losses in hot regions;\
    \ projected production losses of 7\u201314% by 2099 in high-warming scenario."
Methodology:
  1: Annual panel models, long-difference regressions and cross-sectional regressions;
    data set of subnational economic output for more than 1500 regions in 77 countries
  2: The paper uses a panel of subnational GDP data, Gross Regional Product (GRP),
    to analyze local weather and climate conditions across various time scales globally.
  3: The paper uses panel, long-difference, and cross-sectional estimates to assess
    economic climate damages. It also employs a stylized Ramsey-type growth model
    to illustrate economic impacts of climate change on different time scales.
  6: "Uses gridded climate data (CRU TS v3.23) aggregated to the region level using\
    \ area-weighted averages, applying a two-step algorithm to assign climate information\
    \ to regions. It also uses temperature projections for 2015\u20132099 from the\
    \ ISIMIP project under RCP 8.5. The study covers more than 1500 regions in 77\
    \ countries."
  7: The analysis uses an annual panel model, a long-difference model, and a cross-sectional
    model. The annual panel model exploits the annual panel structure of the data.
    The long-difference model analyzes changes over longer time periods (1995-2004
    vs. 2005-2014 and 1985-1994 vs. 2005-2014). The cross-sectional model uses data
    from the period 2005-2014.
  8: The study uses panel regression models with fixed effects for region and year.
    The models are estimated using data from 1900-2014 (or 1980-2014), and standard
    errors are clustered at the country level. Different model variants are explored,
    including linear and non-linear specifications, and models with interaction terms.
  9: Annual panel model, long-difference model (10-year periods), and cross-sectional
    model. The annual panel model considers different lag structures for temperature,
    while the long-difference model examines changes over 10-year periods. Robustness
    checks include country-year fixed effects, restricting the panel to more balanced
    years (1981 on), using re-analysis climate data (ERA5), replacing quadratic time
    trends with linear ones, and excluding small regions.
  10: "Climate and GRP data are aggregated to 10-year intervals with 2005\u20132014\
    \ as a reference period. Regression analysis is used with and without country\
    \ fixed effects. Robustness checks are performed with geographical covariates.\
    \ Applicable over all decades, with the temperature coefficient remarkably stable\
    \ and significant at the 10%-level except for the earliest period (1955\u2013\
    1964)."
  11: Long-difference regression model comparing different 10-year periods (1995-2004
    to 2005-2014, and 1985-1994 to 2005-2014). Country fixed effects included, and
    standard errors clustered at the country level.
  12: Cross-sectional regressions using 10-year intervals for climate and GRP data,
    including country fixed effects and clustering standard errors at the country
    level. Also uses panel and cross-sectional regression results of the historic
    climate-GRP relationship to project GRP losses under past and future warming.
  13: Analysis compares cross-sectional and panel regression models, highlighting
    differences in estimated GRP losses, notably using a reduced-form damage function
    relevant for integrated assessment models.
  14: Losses were computed based on panel regression estimate and cross-sectional
    estimate.
  15: Uses panel and cross-sectional estimates for GRP loss and evaluates damage functions
    in integrated assessment models like DICE.
  16: Analysis uses panel and cross-sectional regression models to examine the impact
    of temperature on GDP and includes comparisons with other models.
  17: "Annual panel models and cross-sectional models are used to estimate the effect\
    \ of a 1\xB0C temperature increase on GRP. Marginal effects at 25\xB0C are given\
    \ for non-linear annual panel specifications. Panel estimates can be considered\
    \ actual TFP impacts that occur without any adjustments in saving dynamics. Cross-sectional\
    \ regressions suggest a negative relationship between temperature and GRP that\
    \ is stable over different decades."
  18: Uses a stylized growth model with comprehensive subnational data; includes cross-sectional
    and panel regression models.
More Notes:
  1: Excludes non-market damages and damages from extreme weather events or sea-level
    rise.
  6: The CRU database was chosen for its high spatial resolution, global coverage,
    and extensive temporal time scale.
  8: The models suggest that while temperature changes affect transitory or long-run
    growth, there's no clear effect of temperature levels on the growth rate when
    interaction terms are included.
  9: The insignificant results in the long-difference model could be due to adaptation
    or small temperature changes between periods. An increase in precipitation decreases
    growth in some model specifications but the effect is not robust over time.
  10: Altitude is negatively correlated with temperature and biases the temperature
    coefficient downward if omitted. Running the regression without country fixed
    effects leads to much higher temperature coefficients of about 0.1.
  11: CRU climate data is used. Using ERA5 climate data leads to temperature coefficients
    of similar magnitude.
  12: The analysis considers a business-as-usual climate change mitigation scenario.
    The future impact calculations disregard the effect of precipitation due to insignificant
    coefficients and high uncertainties in projections. The analysis uses various
    weighting methods (unweighted, land-surface area weighted, output weighted, and
    population weighted) to aggregate regional impacts globally.
  14: Cross-sectional regression model implies a log-linear damage function. Damages
    depend on the length of the considered time period.
  17: The study primarily covers impacts on labor productivity, land productivity,
    and depreciation of capital. Non-market damages, damages due to sea level rise,
    and years of life lost are not captured. Long-run GDP reductions due to endogenous
    decreases in capital stocks are about 50% higher than the immediate short-run
    reductions due to lower productivity.
  18: Differentiates impact on productivity and growth rates; potential to improve
    integrated assessment models with new damage functions.
Quantitative material:
  1: "An increase in global mean surface temperature by about 3.5 \u25E6 C until the\
    \ end of the century would reduce global output by 7\u201314% in 2100; the social\
    \ cost of carbon from temperature-induced productivity losses is on the order\
    \ of 73\u2013142$/tCO2 in 2020, rising to 92\u2013181$/tCO2 in 2030"
  3: Marginal effects of temperature increase are higher than assumed in most Integrated
    Assessment Models (IAMs).
  6: Average annual per-capita growth in USD is 7%.
  7: The paper presents summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and
    maximum) for variables such as per-capita growth rate, annual mean temperature,
    and annual total precipitation, and the changes in those variables, using panel
    data, long-difference data, and cross-sectional data. The summary statistics are
    provided in Tables 1, 2, and 3. In annual panel data, the mean per-capita growth
    rate is 0.070, with a standard deviation of 0.158. The mean annual temperature
    is 14.614 degrees Celsius.
  8: "The study provides regression coefficients for various models, including interactions\
    \ between temperature and precipitation changes and levels. It also reports marginal\
    \ effects (ME) of temperature increases at 10\xB0C and 25\xB0C on GRP, and optimal\
    \ temperature levels (Topt). Marginal effects at 25\xB0C range from -2.6% to -3.7%\
    \ per 1\xB0C increase. Optimal temperature levels range between 5\xB0C and 10\xB0\
    C."
  9: "Adding one-year lagged weather changes increases R2-adjusted and BIC considerably.\
    \ Temperature increased by only 0.46\xB0C on average between 1985-1994 and 2005-2014."
  10: "One degree of temperature increase reduces GRP by 2\u20134%."
  11: "Regression coefficients for the effect of changes in 10-year average weather\
    \ on economic growth, standard errors, R-squared values, marginal effects of temperature\
    \ at 10\xB0C and 25\xB0C."
  12: Cross-sectional regression results show coefficients for T and P on the log
    of GRP for different 10-year periods (1955-1964 to 2005-2014).
  13: Reduction in global GRP ranges from 6.6% to 14.2% depending on estimation method
    and weighting scheme.
  14: "GRP would be reduced in 2099. Red denotes highest losses (more than 20% reduction\
    \ in GRP) whereas blue indicates that regions bene\uFB01t."
  15: In 2100, carbon prices according to their damage estimate would be roughly 2.7
    times (output-weighted) or 2.9 times (population-weighted) higher than original
    estimates.
  16: Estimated social costs of carbon (SCC) for different years are provided, with
    2020 SCC ranging from $37 to $142 per ton of CO2, depending on the damage function
    used.
  17: "Annual panel models estimate GRP losses of 0.8% at 10\xB0C and 3.5% at 25\xB0\
    C temperature increase (preferred; 1 lag); temperature level models estimate 0.5%\
    \ and 2.6% at 10\xB0C and 25\xB0C, respectively (0 lag), and 2.4% and 2.6% (5\
    \ lags). Cross-sectional models estimate 2.0-4.3% loss."
  18: "1\xB0C temperature increase in hot regions with mean temperature of 25\xB0\
    C reduces GRP by about 3.5%."
