Drivers of Risk:
  3: Hydroclimatic variability, persistent negative precipitation anomalies (drought),
    temperature and precipitation variability.
  4: Anthropogenic climate changes due to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon
    dioxide; changes in temperature and precipitation (including increased variability).
  5: 'Sensitivity factors: importance of agriculture, status of infrastructure and
    insurance systems, prevailing climate conditions.'
  6: High levels of hydroclimatic variability, as characterized by floods and drought
    or simply extended dry and wet seasons; Climate variability associated with the
    El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO); Epidemic outbreaks of malaria linked to climate
    variability
  7: Climate variability, poorly developed markets and transportation infrastructure,
    climate change.
  8: Climate variability, rainfall variability, hydroclimatic variability, covariant
    risks (e.g., droughts).
  9: Rainfall variability (monsoon onset date, rainfall shocks), drought, unmanaged
    climate risk, covariant risk.

    rainfall variability, geographic challenges, poor institutions.
  12: Climate variability (soil moisture, rainfall, temperature), climate means (average
    conditions), drought
  13: Climate change (temperature and precipitation changes), hydroclimatic variability
    (rainfall variability), climate anomalies.
  14: Rainfall extremes considering welfare indicators and GDP growth.
  15: Rainfall anomalies, drought
  16: Anomalous rainfall (both drought and flood), with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa
    (SSA).
  17: Climate variability (specifically, drought as measured by WASP index).
  19: Climate measures for country i at time t (Xit), e.g., amount of rainfall, mean
    annual temperature
  22: Drought risk (represented by the WASP index). Precipitation variability (climate
    extremes).
  23: Drought, Precipitation, Temperature, Positive rainfall anomalies (WASP(+) indices)
  25: Drought is identified as a significant climate effect on economic growth in
    SSA.
  26: Temperature, precipitation, moderate drought, severe drought, above average
    rains (WASP - Water Availability and Storage Project index)
  27: Persistent dry conditions (drought) measured by the WASP index
  28: Hydroclimatic variability (drought, floods, seasonal dry/wet periods, interannual
    variability related to ENSO, decadal scale variability related to low frequency
    ocean circulation patterns); temperature changes; precipitation changes.
  29: Hydroclimatic extremes, particularly drought, are primary concerns affecting
    vulnerable populations.
  30: Hydrometeorologic risks experienced by SSA due to low infrastructure levels
    compared to developed countries.
  34: The 'funding' variable (fundgov) and 'PSNP-w' variables (PSNP_w - msni, PSNP_w
    - new) are potential drivers of risk affecting GDP growth.
  39: "Precipitation (Precip), threats related to water (Threat), and Water Productivity\
    \ and Flood Protection measures (WPFP) including treatment (WPFP\u2014treat),\
    \ climate change considerations (WPFP\u2014cc), and stepwise implementation (WPFP\u2014\
    step)."
Highlights:
  3: Drought is identified as the priority concern for adaptation to climate change
    in Sub-Saharan Africa, contrary to the focus on temperature increases in many
    climate change impact assessments.
  4: Climate change is a growing concern for policy makers due to its potential impact
    on economic growth and various sectors; projections in temperature are uniformly
    positive, but precipitation changes are more uncertain.
  5: Industrialized economies may be most sensitive to temperature changes, while
    lower latitude countries with less diversified economies may be more sensitive
    to precipitation changes.
  6: Tropical countries are on average less wealthy, more dependent on agriculture,
    face a more challenging baseline climate in terms of rainfall variability, have
    less developed infrastructure, and lack financial instruments such as insurance
    and markets to mitigate these effects. High levels of hydroclimatic variability
    are a likely impediment to development, especially in countries with enhanced
    vulnerability due to high dependence on agriculture and low infrastructure inventory.
  7: Climate effects on economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa need to be understood
    to inform adaptation policy making. Climate variability is a dominant source of
    consumption risk in smallholder rainfed agriculture.
  8: Climate variability has a significant negative effect on economic progress in
    the locations studied, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
  9: Rainfall variability and drought have significant negative impacts on household
    income and economic growth, and can increase poverty. Farmers often struggle to
    manage covariant climate risk. Farmers adapt to climate change but often with
    non-scientific information.
  10: Hydroclimatic variability has a significant effect on households in SSA and
    national economic growth; rainfall extremes have major impacts on economic development;
    even countries at low levels of development can be vulnerable to climate change.
  11: Climate is a 'significant handicap' representing 20% of the difference with
    industrialized countries in economic output.
  12: Climate variability is sometimes more important than climate means for economic
    outcomes. The effect of climate differs significantly across countries (US, Brazil,
    India, SSA) suggesting differential capacity to manage climate risks. Adverse
    climates contribute to rural poverty.
  13: Effects of climate change on global economic growth remain inconclusive. Developing
    countries and SSA are likely to have different responses to climate change compared
    to developed countries. There is little analysis of the economic effects of climate
    variability at the country scale.
  14: Inclusion of industrial value added and poverty headcount ratios in analysis
    expands commonly considered national scale studies.
  15: The WASP index is correlated with drought indices like the Palmer Drought Severity
    Index and is designed to avoid splitting rainy seasons across calendar years,
    which is particularly relevant for regions with boreal winter rainy seasons like
    much of Africa.
  22: Drought risk has a statistically significant negative effect on GDP per capita
    growth in SSA.
  23: Drought negatively impacts Agricultural GDP and Industrial GDP. Positive rainfall
    anomalies (measured over longer time periods) positively impact Agricultural GDP.
    Precipitation positively impacts Industrial GDP. Temperature has a significant
    negative effect on Industrial GDP without precipitation in the model.
  25: Drought indices are consistently significant across model specifications, indicating
    drought's impact on economic growth.
  26: Drought has a significantly negative impact on GDP and increases poverty; Above
    average rains positively affect agricultural value added; Temperature is only
    significant when precipitation is not included.
  27: Persistent drought has a consistent negative effect on economic growth in Sub-Saharan
    Africa. Temperature may not be as indicative of climate effects on economic growth
    as drought.
  28: Hydroclimatic variability is a major impediment to agricultural productivity
    in SSA and penetrates to the level of national economies; economic growth in the
    present depends on the ability to manage the effects of hydroclimatic variability
    in SSA; temperature changes may have greater impact in developed countries.
  29: A diversified portfolio of interventions may help mitigate uninsured risks and
    support economic development.
  30: Developed countries reduce exposure to hydroclimatic risks through infrastructure
    investments.
  33: The table highlights the statistical significance of certain coefficients, allowing
    for an assessment of the relative importance of different drivers.
  34: The table presents regression results showing the estimated impact of 'fundgov',
    'PSNP_w - msni', and 'PSNP_w - new' on GDP per capita growth, with statistical
    significance levels indicated. The number of observations ranges from 778 to 7782.
  36: Asterisks indicate statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, suggesting
    some variables have a statistically significant impact.
  38: Statistical significance is indicated by stars (*, **, ***) next to the coefficients.
  39: The table details the impact of various water-related factors and interventions
    on GDP, with statistical significance indicated by stars.

    statistic that incorporates spatial and temporal variability within each country,
    and country-level economic growth statistics.

    regions/countries, focusing on temperature changes; consideration of precipitation
    changes and variability.
  7: Econometric analysis of national level economic growth and climate data. Review
    of previous studies of climate change impacts on economic growth.
  8: Case studies, panel studies, cross-country analyses, climate change studies,
    surveys, and econometric analysis.
  9: Panel data analysis of villages in India and Ethiopia, study of farm households
    in Cameroon, summary of studies from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
  10: Single country studies, economy-wide impact studies of drought on multiple SSA
    countries.
  11: Cross-country regression analyses, global subnational economic output database.
  12: Ricardian analysis (comparing farm income across climates), comparison of agricultural
    production in SSA vs. non-SSA countries
  13: Studies, regression analysis, spatial relationship between climate and economic
    output.
  14: Analysis includes livelihood measures and climate data; panel data available
    from 1961-2005; uses spatially averaged national climate data from 1901-2003.
  15: Uses a weighted anomaly standardized precipitation (WASP) index calculated at
    a 0.5-degree grid cell level to measure rainfall anomalies. The WASP index is
    calculated using a specific formula (provided in the text) that considers monthly
    precipitation deviations from long-term means, weighted by the contribution of
    each month to the annual total. Thresholds are set at -2, -1, +1, +2 values of
    WASP. The ending month is selected based on the seasonality of rainfall.
  16: Calculates a Water Anomaly Severity Percentage (WASP) index based on monthly
    rainfall data, identifying areas exceeding certain thresholds to represent drought
    and flood risk. Thresholds are used to account for non-linear responses to rainfall
    anomalies.
  17: "Cross-country regressions are used to establish a relationship between climate\
    \ variability and livelihood indicators. The general specification is Yi = \u03B2\
    Xi + \xB5Vi+ \u03B5i."
  18: Random effects regression estimates time-invariant characteristics but requires
    the assumption that individual entity effects are uncorrelated with the regressors.
  19: "Fixed effects regression using panel data for 42 Sub-Saharan African countries.\
    \  Controls for time-invariant country characteristics (\u03B1i).  Standard errors\
    \ clustered and non-clustered at the country level. The identifying assumption\
    \ is that the effect of the time-invariant country characteristics does not change\
    \ over time."
  20: Random effects require assumptions such as the uncorrelation of country effects
    with climate variability and normal distribution of effects.
  22: Cross-country regressions on per capita GDP using a dataset limited to the countries
    of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), controlling for regional effects. Using WASP variables
    as measures of precipitation variability impacting economic growth.
  23: Regressions were performed using Agricultural GDP, Industrial GDP, and poverty
    headcounts as dependent variables. Includes Sub-Saharan African countries.
  25: The analysis includes fixed effects for basic regressions with precipitation
    and temperature, and random effects for most specifications with WASP variables.
  26: Fixed effects regressions with clustered standard errors are used; Cross-country
    regressions are also mentioned; WASP is a variable representing water availability
  27: Cross-country and panel regression analysis using a precipitation-based index
    (WASP) to capture subnational spatial aspects and distinguish between small and
    large rainfall anomalies in Sub-Saharan Africa. Fixed effects and randomized effects
    are used in panel regressions.
  28: Study uses WASP index to represent drought.
  34: Regression analysis is used to estimate the impact of specific variables on
    GDP growth. Standard errors and significance levels are reported, suggesting an
    econometric approach. The results are applicable to the specific context and data
    used in the study.
  36: Regression analysis with time periods and country clustered standard errors.
  38: The analysis uses Fixed Effects and Random Effects models. The footnote mentions
    OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression.
  39: Regression analysis is used to model the relationship between GDP and the identified
    risk factors, including fixed effects.
More Notes:
  3: The study focuses on Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
  4: The report acknowledges the difficulty in projecting precipitation changes and
    higher order statistics of rainfall, but notes some indication that precipitation
    variability will increase.
  6: The paper highlights the vulnerability of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and the rural
    poor to climate-related risks due to their dependence on agriculture, lack of
    access to resources, and vulnerability to diseases exacerbated by climate variability.
  7: The analysis considers differential climate changes and varying capacities to
    manage these challenges across countries in SSA. The paper investigates current
    vulnerabilities of SSA economies. Adaptation planning is discussed based on the
    findings.
  8: Case studies and panel studies tend to find a dominant and negative effect of
    climate on economic growth in SSA, while cross-country analyses highlight the
    role of institutions. Rural households have limited means for managing climate-related
    risks, leading to risk aversion.
  9: The studies focus on the household level, but the aggregate impact of these effects
    could have macroeconomic and fiscal implications at a national level, especially
    in agrarian economies.
  10: Vulnerability to drought may increase as a country develops; poorest economies
    may appear insensitive to rainfall fluctuations due to risk aversion and low levels
    of investment.
  11: Studies often omit the differences in rainfall variability that affect the tropics
    disproportionately.
  12: The study by Barrios et al. (2008) suggests long-term droughts in the Sahel
    have significantly impacted agricultural production. The studies warn against
    projecting economic effects using only changes to the mean of single climate variables.
  13: The role of rainfall variability in deterring agricultural investment is highlighted.
    Most impact studies have focused on developed countries and extrapolated to other
    regions.
  15: No relevant information
  16: The study acknowledges the lack of objective flood data for SSA, which limits
    the analysis. It also highlights the importance of considering the full annual
    rainfall cycle, particularly in regions where the rainy season spans calendar
    years.
  19: The livelihood measure is not specified as macroeconomic or fiscal, but is the
    main outcome of interest. The paper suggests that cross-sectional regressions
    can be inconsistent due to unobserved time-invariant country characteristics.
    The fixed effects approach aims to address this.
  22: The positive WASP variables may not accurately represent flood effects and require
    further refinement.
  23: The effect of drought on industrial GDP may be due to reduced hydroelectricity
    and the upstream effects of poor agricultural production. Positive rainfall anomalies
    (WASP(+) indices) are interpreted as advantageous to agriculture and not representative
    of flood effects.
  26: The study focuses on developing countries; Data limitations prevented reporting
    fixed effects results for industrial GDP value added.
  27: The study suggests a one-year lag in the impact of drought, potentially due
    to propagation through agriculture to secondary industries. The analysis focuses
    on hydroclimatic variability rather than temperature.
  28: Focus on temperature changes in economic evaluations of climate change impacts
    may be due to the reduced uncertainty in the direction of temperature projections.
    Flood risk is likely to be an important concern for economic growth in SSA.
  38: The table appears to present results from an empirical study using the European
    Values Study data.
  39: The analysis uses panel data and includes fixed effects to control for unobserved
    heterogeneity. Different model specifications are presented in columns (2) through
    (17).

    significant climate influence on economic growth, consistent across model specifications
    and several measures of welfare and economic activity.
  4: Estimated negative potential consequences of climate change are sizeable.
  6: "Droughts have been identified as the world\u2019s most expensive disaster (FEMA,\
    \ 1995)."
  9: Growth reduced by one fifth due to rainfall shocks in Ethiopia. 15% less poverty
    in Ethiopia without rainfall shocks.
  10: Droughts and floods reduced Ethiopian economic growth by more than one third;
    Kenya suffered annual damages of 10-16% of GDP due to flooding and drought; 88%
    of flood losses in Kenya were in the transport sector; hydropower and industrial
    production losses totalled 84% of drought losses in Kenya.

  13: Estimates of climate change impact on global economic growth range from -0.2
    to -0.4% for 2.5C warming (Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000), to a neutral effect (Mendelsohn,
    Dinar and Williams, unpublished report) to +2.3% per 1C of warming (Tol, 2002).

    variables on the outcomes of interest; WASP(+1) coefficient is significant and
    positive for agricultural value added; WASP(-1) and WASP(-2) are significant and
