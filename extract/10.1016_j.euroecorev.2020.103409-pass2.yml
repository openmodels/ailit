Drivers_of_Risk:
  31: Supply shocks, demand shocks, foreign shocks, and weather shocks.
Highlights:
  1: Weather shocks significantly impact GDP and agricultural output in New Zealand;
    Climate change exacerbates the negative welfare impact of weather shocks.
  2: The paper aims to address the short-term dimension of weather impacts, filling
    a gap in the literature.
  3: Adverse weather shocks cause a large and persistent contraction of agricultural
    production, accompanied by a decline in consumption, investment and a rise in
    hours worked. At an international level, a weather shock causes current account
    deficits and a depreciation of the domestic currency.
  4: Climate change increases the variability of key macroeconomic variables; high
    welfare cost of business cycles induced by weather shocks.
  6: The study quantifies the impact of temperature shocks on productivity growth
    and emphasizes the role of weather shocks in welfare costs.
  7: New Zealand has experienced cyclical changes in its soil water deficits index
    over the last two decades, oscillating between periods of high volumetric water
    content in soils and periods of droughts; New Zealand has undergone numerous episodes
    of severe droughts of various intensities that have disrupted its economy to a
    greater or lesser extent, most notably in 2007, 2010, 2013 and 2015.
  8: After a drought shock, the share of the agricultural sector in total output declines
    substantially and temporarily. The share of the primary sector also declines,
    but to a lesser extent. The effect on the secondary sector is unclear. The tertiary
    sector tends to experience a relative expansion.
  9: A drought shock (rise in soil moisture deficits) leads to a contraction of New
    Zealand's economy, initially affecting agricultural production with a contemporaneous
    0.12% decline and a peak decline of 1.27% after three periods.
  10: Weather shocks have persistent effects on the economy, particularly the labor
    market, suggesting a unique propagation mechanism. Weather mimics the dynamic
    patterns of a TFP shock.
  11: "a weather variable denoted \u03B5Wt is introduced in the model...this variable\
    \ captures variations in soil moisture that a\uFB00ect the production process\
    \ of agricultural goods"
  13: "Agricultural production is tied up with exogenous weather conditions through\
    \ a damage function \u2126(\xB7)."
  14: Droughts can have persistent effects on land productivity and crop yields, requiring
    several months for recovery. Farmers can offset soil dryness by increasing field
    irrigation or feeding budgets.
  16: The shape of the land maintenance cost function is critical in determining the
    response of agricultural production to a drought shock. A linear or convex cost
    function is preferred to model an increase in land expenditures following an adverse
    weather shock.
  19: No relevant information
  20: Foreign consumption shocks drive export demand and exchange rate dynamics in
    New Zealand; Government budget constraint is modeled explicitly.
  21: Time-preference shocks drive capital flows to New Zealand by lowering the foreign
    real interest rate.
  26: "Data were fairly informative for posterior distributions; local identi\uFB01\
    cation conditions are fulfilled by the estimated model."
  27: Weather shocks can significantly reduce land productivity, with extreme droughts
    having substantial impacts.
  28: "Compares a model with weather-driven business cycles to a benchmark model with\
    \ no weather damage (\u03B8=0) to determine if weather shocks significantly explain\
    \ part of the business cycle."
  29: Weather shocks matter in explaining business cycles in New Zealand; A drought
    shock acts as a negative supply shock, leading to a decline in agricultural output
    and land productivity.
  30: Droughts lead to a contraction of economic activity, trade deficits, and a depreciation
    of the real exchange rate. The effect of the agricultural sector outweighs the
    non-agricultural sector.
  31: Weather shocks cause significant macroeconomic fluctuations, with increasing
    long-term impact on GDP and agricultural production variance.
  32: Weather shocks significantly impact agricultural production, with severe droughts
    causing substantial slowdowns. Weather shocks also affect GDP, consumption, and
    labor, although to a lesser extent than agricultural production. There is a spillover
    mechanism from agriculture to the rest of the economy.
  33: "The land expenditure cost (\u03C6) significantly affects the propagation mechanism\
    \ of a weather shock, influencing the marginal cost of land inputs. Lower returns\
    \ to land inputs results in a spike in the relative price of the agricultural\
    \ sector, creating a recession. Labor substitutability parameter (\u03B9) shapes\
    \ labor supply substitution between sectors. An increase in \u03C6 increases land\
    \ expenditures, reducing GDP."
  34: Increased cost of labor reallocation amplifies recession. Low decay rate of
    land productivity amplifies and increases the persistence of macroeconomic fluctuations
    after a drought. The paper examines the impact of climate change by analyzing
    changes in the variance of weather shocks.
  35: Climate change induces important changes in the volatility of key macroeconomic
    variables. The most pessimistic scenario (RCP 8.5) exhibits a strong increase
    in the volatility of macroeconomic variables.
  36: Welfare cost increases as RCP scenarios become more severe, indicating greater
    weather-driven business cycle impacts on welfare.
  37: The welfare cost of weather shocks is non-trivial due to the weather hysteresis
    effect (persistence of land productivity deterioration). Increasing the variance
    of weather shocks leads to welfare losses, even in the optimistic scenario. There
    is a strong non-linear relationship between the variance of weather shocks and
    welfare costs.
  38: Weather shocks matter in explaining the business cycles of New Zealand; weather
    shocks generate a recession through a contraction of agricultural production and
    investment combined with a rise in hours worked; weather shocks are an important
    driver of agricultural production and, in a smaller proportion, of the GDP; increased
    variability of weather events leads to an increase in the variability of key macroeconomic
    variables; welfare costs increase with the variability of weather events.
  42: The volatility of the weather shock is projected to increase significantly under
    pessimistic climate scenarios (RCP 8.5), with a drastic increase of 23.25% in
    the variance of the climate measure.
  43: The tables present the calibrated parameters used in the model and the results
    of the Bayesian estimation, showing the prior and posterior distributions of various
    parameters and shocks.
  44: The paper presents IRFs for a weather shock using DSGE and SVAR models and reports
    steady-state ratios of key macroeconomic variables, comparing model results to
    empirical data.
  45: The red line (weather shock only) depicts the contribution of the weather shock
    to the deviation of the variables.
  46: "IRFs are expressed in percentage deviations of the estimated model\u2019s steady\
    \ state. Prior to period 1 (shaded area), the model is at its deterministic steady\
    \ state."
  47: Figure 11 shows how the economy responds to a weather shock depending on land
    efficiency decay rates. Figure 12 shows estimates of the increase in the standard
    error of the weather shock under different climate scenarios
Methodology:
  1: Vector Auto-Regressive model on New Zealand data; General equilibrium model with
    a weather-dependent agricultural sector
  2: The paper aims to reconcile theoretical models of the weather with data, using
    the weather as an observable variable, to disentangle the contribution of weather
    shocks from alternative sources of business cycles.
  3: 'Two-step strategy: (1) SVAR model to document transmission mechanisms of weather
    shocks; (2) DSGE model with a weather-dependent agricultural sector, estimated
    through Bayesian techniques.'
  4: Theoretical model connecting macroeconomy with weather, counterfactual analysis
    increasing the volatility of weather shocks based on IPCC(2014) projections.
  6: The analysis uses a real business cycle model introducing temperature and rainfall
    as explanatory factors of productivity.
  7: Construction of a macroeconomic index based on observations of soil moisture
    deficits to measure land productivity; examination of changes in the relative
    share of each sector in the total production of New Zealand.
  8: The analysis examines the evolution of sectoral shares in total production before
    and after drought events. Correlations are computed between the time series of
    a weather index and the relative share of different sectors using the Pearson
    test.
  9: Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model with restrictions to portray New
    Zealand's specific situation as a small open economy and imposing exogenous weather.
    A lower triangular Choleski decomposition is used to derive orthogonal impulse
    responses. The model uses one lag.
  10: SVAR impulse response, 10,000 Monte-Carlo simulations, two-sector two-good small
    open economy DSGE model with flexible exchange rate.
  12: The paper uses a stochastic model with an exogenous weather process. The agricultural
    sector is modeled with a Cobb-Douglas production function. The model considers
    farmers' surprise from contemporaneous and future weather shocks, and excludes
    news shocks about weather, because the usual forecast horizon for farmers about
    weather shocks lies between 1 and 15 days.
  13: Model is solved up to a first approximation to the policy function.
  14: The paper develops a model with time-varying land productivity, where land productivity
    decays over time and can be increased through agricultural spending (pesticides,
    herbicides, seeds, fertilizers, and water).
  15: The analysis includes an optimization problem faced by a representative farmer,
    focusing on choosing input levels under constraints of land efficiency, capital
    law of motions, and technology.
  16: The paper uses a model with a representative household and two production sectors
    (agricultural and non-agricultural) to analyze the impact of weather shocks.
  19: "Firms maximize the discounted sum of pro\uFB01ts: max{hNit,iNit,kNit}Et {\u2211\
    \u03C4=0\u221E \u039Bt,t+sdNit+\u03C4} under technology and capital accumulation\
    \ constraints."
  20: Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of a small open economy;
    Foreign economy modeled as an endowment economy with exogenous consumption `a
    la Lucas (1978); Model includes equations for government budget constraint and
    foreign consumption; Parameter estimation to fit the model.
  21: Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with two sectors (agricultural
    and non-agricultural) and home/foreign countries.
  23: Bayesian estimation using a VAR model. Output, investment, and foreign output
    are detrended using a quadratic trend after dividing by working age population
    and taking logs. Hours worked are corrected using Smets and Wouters (2007) method.
    The drought index is a weighted mean of local state soil moisture, with weights
    based on agricultural output.
  25: Estimation using Bayesian methods with specific prior distributions for model
    parameters. Prior distributions are defined for land efficiency decay rate, land
    share in production, land cost, and damage function parameters. It is likely part
    of a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model because it references
    Smets and Wouters (2007) which uses a DSGE model.
  26: Bayesian estimation using Metropolis-Hastings algorithm; dynare package (Adjemian
    et al. 2011); 800,000 total samples, 80,000 discarded, eight parallel chains.
  27: Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model is estimated with Bayesian
    techniques to examine the effects of weather shocks on the macroeconomy.
  28: "Estimation of two versions of a model: one with a damage function linking weather\
    \ to agriculture and business cycles (\u03B8\u0338= 0) and one without (\u03B8\
    = 0). Bayesian model comparison using Laplace-approximated marginal data densities,\
    \ posterior odds ratio, and posterior model probabilities."
  29: A Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model and a Structural Vector
    Autoregression (SVAR) model are used to analyze the propagation of weather shocks;
    Bayesian methods are used to compare model probabilities.
  30: DSGE model and SVAR model are used. The DSGE model predicts a higher contraction
    of economic activity combined with a weaker response of the real exchange rate
    compared to the SVAR model.
  31: 'Variance decomposition into five components: supply shocks, demand shocks,
    foreign shocks, weather shocks, and others, analyzed across different quarters.'
  32: Estimation of a model, simulation of model's response to all estimated shocks
    and initial conditions, and simulation of the model's response to only weather
    shocks.
  33: Computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with a weather-dependent agricultural
    sector; impulse response functions (IRFs) are expressed in percentage deviations
    from the steady state.
  34: The paper uses a model with agriculture and non-agriculture sectors to analyze
    the impact of weather shocks. It investigates how changes in the variance of weather
    shocks affect aggregate fluctuations. The model assumes climate is stationary,
    but it can tackle the implications of a change in the variance of weather shocks.
  35: DSGE model simulations comparing macroeconomic volatility under historical weather
    conditions (1989-2014) to future climate scenarios (2015-2100) based on different
    alterations of the variance of the weather shock.
  36: Simulations with modified weather shock variances under different RCP scenarios;
    variances normalized to 100 and changes measured against historical period.
  37: Simulations are used to assess welfare costs under alternative scenarios, including
    increasing the variance of weather shocks to approximate climate change. The analysis
    doesn't account for crop and livestock adaptation, so costs are interpreted as
    a maximum bound.
  38: Developed and estimated a DSGE model for New Zealand, a small open economy,
    including an agricultural sector affected by exogenous weather variations. Also
    uses SVAR.
  39: Risk disaster theory in asset pricing
  41: "Uses monthly climatic data simulated from the Community Climate System Model\
    \ (CCSM) at a 0.9\u25E6\xD71.25\u25E6grid resolution."
  42: Uses a rolling window approach with an AR(1) model on rainfall data (as a proxy
    for soil moisture deficit) to estimate the evolution of weather shock volatility
    under different RCP scenarios. The window size is 25.5 years (102 observations).
  43: The paper employs Bayesian estimation techniques using prior and posterior distributions
    for the model's parameters. The model appears to be a dynamic stochastic general
    equilibrium (DSGE) model, judged by the presence of a discount factor, capital
    depreciation rate, factor shares, and various shocks. The model is calibrated
    on quarterly data.
  44: Estimated DSGE and SVAR model. Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) are generated
    when parameters are drawn from the mean posterior distribution. Empirical ratios
    are computed using data between 1990 to 2017.
  45: Uses a model (unspecified) and compares model output when fed all shocks with
    the model when fed only weather shocks; forecast error variance decomposition
    at the posterior mean for different time horizons (one, ten, forty and unconditional).
  46: Estimated model, Impulse response functions
  47: The analysis uses impulse response functions to model the impact of a weather
    shock. Climate scenarios (representative concentration pathways) are used to project
    CO2 emissions and precipitations.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on New Zealand.
  2: The paper argues that existing theoretical models are not relevant for short-run
    business cycle analysis, while empirical models lack a general equilibrium perspective.
  3: The model focuses on New Zealand due to its vulnerability to weather shocks and
    its relatively small size. Weather is treated as an exogenous process.
  7: The index allows to easily date and monitor severe weather events which are very
    likely to be costly for the agricultural sector.
  8: The primary sector includes mining and fishing, which are less sensitive to the
    weather than agriculture.
  9: The model includes a foreign block with a measure of GDP for the rest of the
    world. The analysis examines impulse responses to a one-standard-deviation shock
    of the drought variable. The data are in real terms and expressed in percentage
    deviations from a log-linear trend.
  10: The model includes agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, with the agricultural
    sector facing weather-related productivity shocks. The model is calibrated to
    New Zealand as a small open economy.
  11: "\u03B5Nt is a stochastic AR(1) process"
  12: The paper justifies the weather exogeneity assumption by arguing that the feedback
    loop between human activity and CO2 emissions is fragile in canonical models like
    Nordhaus (1991). The paper mentions that an alternative version of the model based
    on a CES agricultural production function did not improve the fit or identifiability
    of the CES parameter.
  13: Weather hysteresis effects imply atypical supply dynamics in agriculture.
  14: "The model relaxes the assumption of fixed land and introduces an endogenous\
    \ law of motion for land productivity. A specific functional form for land costs\
    \ is assumed: v(xit) = \u03C4\u03C6x\u03C6it."
  16: The model incorporates imperfect substitutability of labor between the agricultural
    and non-agricultural sectors.
  19: "Public spending is assumed to be exogenous, Gt= YNtg\u03B5Gt, where g\u2208\
    [0,1) is a \uFB01xed fraction of non-agricultural goods a\uFB00ected by a standard\
    \ AR(1) stochastic shock: log(\u03B5Gt) = \u03C1G log(\u03B5Gt\u22121)+ \u03C3\
    G\u03B7Gt, \u03B7Gt\u223CN(0,1)"
  20: The foreign economy is simplified and only affected by its own consumption shocks,
    not by shocks of the home economy; Most parameters and steady states are symmetric
    between the domestic and foreign economy; The model is designed to be consistent
    with a restricted VAR model featuring a small open economy.
  21: The model includes equations for market clearing conditions in goods and labor
    markets, and specifies the relationship between aggregate supply and demand for
    non-agricultural goods (equation 28).
  23: "The study neglects low frequency components (trends) due to the short sample\
    \ period and challenges in dealing with trends in open economy models. The drought\
    \ index is constructed following Kamber et al. (2013). Incomplete sub-sample for\
    \ world output and hours worked for the period 1989-Q2 and 1993-Q4 are used to\
    \ initialise the Kalman \uFB01lter."
  25: "The paper focuses on the agricultural sector's response to climate change.\
    \ The choice of prior distributions, especially for the damage function parameter\
    \ (\u03B8), is explicitly addressed due to concerns about potential biases in\
    \ Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs)."
  26: The study focuses on New Zealand. The prior distribution for a key parameter
    is set to be very diffuse (uniform distribution, zero mean, standard deviation
    500).
  27: "The paper assesses the magnitude of the damage function on land productivity\
    \ by examining the unconditional mean of the damage function and the contemporaneous\
    \ effects of weather shocks. The high value for parameter \u03B8 is necessary\
    \ to map changes in the weather index and agricultural production cycles."
  28: The model comparison method favors a model with the highest data density, posterior
    odds ratio, and model probability.
  29: The DSGE model provides micro-founded mechanisms that drive the propagation
    of weather shocks, unlike the SVAR model; Farmers compensate for productivity
    loss by increasing hours worked.
  30: The non-agricultural sector experiences a boom due to increased demand for inputs
    for the agricultural sector.
  32: The analysis focuses on New Zealand's macroeconomic experience.
  33: The model focuses on the impact of structural parameters driving the response
    of the economy to weather shocks. The parameters examined influence both the propagation
    of shocks and the steady state of the model.
  35: The analysis focuses on New Zealand. The changes in weather variability are
    determined by a method described in Appendix A.
  36: High welfare cost suggests substantial economic burden from weather shocks,
    especially for economies with large agricultural sectors and less capital intensity.
  37: The utility function used in this paper also features consumption habits. However
    by disabling consumption habits, the welfare cost of the weather remains high
    up to 0.08% in the baseline scenario.
  38: The framework could be used to evaluate the optimal conduct of monetary policy
    to mitigate the destabilizing effects of weather shocks for different scenarios
    of climate change. Fiscal policy (disaster payments) could also play a role, especially
    in low-income countries with imperfect insurance markets.
  42: The analysis uses rainfall as a proxy for soil moisture deficit due to the unavailability
    of the latter data. It doesn't account for the effects of temperature on evapotranspiration.
  43: "The presence of parameters like 'Land per capita' (\u2113) and 'Share of agricultural\
    \ goods in consumption basket' (\u03D5), 'Land efficiency decay rate' (\u03B4\u2113\
    ), and 'Land-weather elasticity' (\u03B8) suggests climate change impacts on agriculture\
    \ and land productivity are considered. The model also incorporates international\
    \ linkages."
  44: The IRFs are reported in percentage deviations from the deterministic steady
    state. Gray areas in the SVAR model IRFs represent 90% confidence intervals.
  45: The 'selected observable variables' are not explicitly named on this page.
  46: "Figure 9 examines different values of the land expenditure cost \u03C6. Figure\
    \ 10 examines various degrees of labor substitution across sectors \u03B9= 0,\
    \ 2.84 and 5."
  47: The analysis uses a model that is at its deterministic steady state prior to
    period 1, where the weather shock occurs.

  31: Supply shocks are main drivers of GDP variance; weather shocks increasingly
    contribute to GDP volatility in the long run.
Quantitative material:
  1: Weather shocks explain about 35% of GDP and agricultural output fluctuations
    in New Zealand; entail a welfare cost of 0.30% of permanent consumption; increase
    macroeconomic volatility under climate change, resulting in a higher welfare cost
    peaking to 0.46% in the worst-case scenario.
  2: Heat waves and droughts have caused significant damages at a global level peaking
    to a total value of US$25 billion in 2012.
  3: Weather shocks play a non-trivial role in driving the business cycles in New
    Zealand.
  4: Households would be willing to give up 0.30% of their unconditional consumption
    to rule out weather shocks; welfare cost of weather driven business cycles peaking
    up to 0.46% in the worst-case climate change scenario.
  6: The paper finds a one-standard deviation temperature shock results in a 1.4 percentage
    point decrease in productivity growth.
  7: The soil moisture deficit index ranges from -4 to +4, where positive values indicate
    a soil moisture deficit and negative values indicate an excess of moisture; the
    10th percent of the most severe episodes can be inferred directly from the time
    series when the soil moisture deficits index peaks above 1.
  8: 'Figure 2 shows the evolution of each sector''s share in total production before
    and after a drought, normalized to 100 at the time of the drought. Table 1 shows
    correlations between sectoral GDP and a weather index. Agriculture: correlation
    -0.31, t-stat -2.99, p-value 0.00, 95% CI [-0.48, -0.10]. Primary Sector: correlation
    -0.25, t-stat -2.41, p-value 0.02, 95% CI [-0.44, -0.04]. Secondary Sector: correlation
    -0.10, t-stat -0.91, p-value 0.37, 95% CI [-0.30, 0.11]. Tertiary Sector: correlation
    0.39, t-stat 3.90, p-value 0.00, 95% CI [0.19, 0.55].'
  9: A rise in soil moisture deficits implies a contemporaneous 0.12% contraction
    of agricultural production, reaching a peak decline of 1.27% after three periods.
  10: 1% weather shock (drought), 0.1% decline in investment.
  12: "Equation (2) defines agricultural output (yAit) as a function of land (\u2113\
    it\u22121), physical capital (kAit\u22121), and labor (hAit), with parameters\
    \ \u03C9 and \u03B1 representing elasticities and shares."
  13: "\u2126(\u03B5Wt) = (\u03B5Wt)^-\u03B8, where \u03B8 determines elasticity of\
    \ land productivity with respect to the weather."
  19: No relevant information
  20: "Equations (23) and (24) provide a quantitative representation of the government\
    \ budget constraint and foreign consumption dynamics; Parameters \u03C3C and \u03C1\
    C are estimated to capture variations of foreign demand."
  21: "Equation (27) defines the time preference shock as log(\u03B5Et) = \u03C1E\
    \ log(\u03B5Et\u22121)+ \u03C3E\u03B7Et, with \u03B7Et\u223CN(0,1)."
  23: Dataset includes 8 time series with 91 observations each, covering 1994Q2 to
    2016Q4 for New Zealand.
  26: "The land-weather elasticity parameter \u03B8 is mentioned in the context of\
    \ posterior distributions."
  27: "Average damage to land productivity is below 0.0008%. An average weather shock\
    \ (\u03C3W\u03B7Wt = 0.81) slashes land productivity by 15%. An extreme drought\
    \ (\u03C3W\u03B7Wt = 1.5) cuts land productivity by 26%. Extreme drought reduces\
    \ agricultural production by 3.6%."
  29: A drought event leads to a 1.5% decline in agricultural output and a 22% decrease
    in land productivity; Posterior odds ratio is 118.97:1 in favor of the model with
    weather-driven business cycles.
  30: Figure 7 reports the forecast error variance decomposition for aggregate real
    production, real agricultural production, real consumption and hours worked. Five
    different time horizons are considered, ranging from two quarters.
  32: Weather shocks contribute between +4% and -6% to agricultural production fluctuations;
    25% of agricultural slowdown after the 2008 drought is accounted for by weather;
    weather contributed 5% to agricultural contraction in 2016; Weather's contribution
    to GDP and consumption growth oscillates between +2% to -2%; Weather-driven changes
    in aggregate labor demand oscillates between -0.5% to 0.9%; 2008 and 2016 droughts
    entailed a joint 1% contraction in GDP and consumption while labor supplied increased
    by 1%.
  33: "The paper uses parameter values \u03C6 = 2.57 (estimated), \u03C6 = 1.57 (lower),\
    \ \u03C6 = 3.57 (higher), \u03B9= 0, \u03B9= 2.9 (estimated), and \u03B9= 5 to\
    \ calibrate its model."
  34: The paper estimates the variance of weather shocks under different climate scenarios.
  35: Under RCP 4.5, variance of total output rises by 5.22%; under RCP 8.5, variance
    of total output rises by 19.19%. Agricultural production volatility increases
    by 21.88% under RCP 8.5. Consumption variance increases by 27.09%, relative price
    of agricultural goods by 16.8%, net foreign assets by 31.86%, current account
    by 11.45%, and real exchange rate by 7.54% under RCP 8.5. A scenario with a -8.03%
    change in the variance of drought events leads to a 3.39% decrease in the variance
    of agricultural output.
  36: Table shows changes in variances of economic variables and welfare costs in
    different RCP scenarios compared to the historical period (1994-2016).
  37: New Zealanders would be willing to give up to 0.3% of their unconditional consumption
    to live in an economy free of droughts; Welfare cost of business cycles induced
    by productivity shocks is evaluated to 0.08%, 0.05% for spending shocks, 0.06%
    for investment shocks, 0.75% for labor supply shocks, 0.12% for sector reallocation
    shock, 0.003% for foreign consumption shock and 0.06% for foreign discount factor.;
    By disabling the persistence mechanism of land productivity, the welfare cost
    of business cycles becomes 0.009% of permanent consumption; Under the optimistic
    (RCP 2.5) scenario, households would abandon 0.30% of their permanent consumption
    due to increased drought volatility; In the worst-case scenario, this fraction
    would reach 0.46%; The welfare cost increased by 0.09, from 0.19% for the historical
    period (1994-2016) to 0.28% for the worst-case scenario.
  38: Households are willing to pay 0.30% of their unconditional consumption to live
    in a world with no weather shocks.
  41: 'Simulated data divided into two sets: historical data up to 2005, and projected
    data from 2006 to 2100 for four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs: 2.6,
    4.5, 6.0, and 8.5).'
  42: The variance of the climate measure (related to weather shock volatility) changes
    by -4.1% under RCP 2.5, +6.82% under RCP 4.5, +9.29% under RCP 6.0, and +23.25%
    under RCP 8.5.
  43: Tables 4 and 5 provide calibrated parameter values and prior/posterior distributions
    for structural parameters and shock processes. Weather shock has SD of 0.81 and
    AR term of 0.38.
  44: Ratio of consumption to output (0.55 DSGE, 0.57 Data), Ratio of investment to
    output (0.23 DSGE, 0.22 Data), Real interest rate (4.72 DSGE, 4.75 Data), Goods
    market openness (0.28 DSGE, 0.29 Data), Ratio of agricultural production to GDP
    (0.08 DSGE, 0.07 Data).
  45: Analysis presents 10th percentile of most severe drought episodes as inferred
    from weather index time series and a comparison between model output with all
    shocks vs. weather shocks only
  46: Impulse response functions (in percentage deviations from steady state of the
    estimated model)
  47: "Figure 11 presents impulse response functions (IRFs) in percentage deviations\
    \ from steady state, following a weather shock for various decay rates of land\
    \ efficiency (\u03B4\u2113= 0 .01, 0 .054 and 0 .10)."
Quantitative_Material:
  31: "Foreign shocks account for 18.4% of New Zealand\u2019s GDP production in the\
    \ short run, and 8.1% in the long run; weather shocks account for 3.7% to 35%\
    \ of GDP variance over time."
