Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (specifically, increasing aridity), rapid economic development,
    population growth, urbanization
  4: Changes in dryland subtypes due to climate change (transitions from drier to
    wetter subtypes, and vice-versa)
  5: Expansion of drylands due to warming and drying trends, leading to reduced soil
    organic carbon storage and increased carbon emissions.
Highlights:
  1: Drylands could cover half the global land surface by the end of this century.
    Dryland expansion will exacerbate land degradation and desertification, particularly
    in developing countries.
  4: The area of drylands that become drier is much larger than the area that becomes
    wetter.  The extent of drier areas increases in the late twenty-first century.
    78% of the increased drylands occur in developing countries.
  5: Drylands will expand significantly by the end of the 21st century, increasing
    vulnerability in developing countries.
Methodology:
  1: Uses historical data to bias-correct CMIP5 projections to project dryland expansion.
    CMIP5 simulation data from 20 global climate models.
  4: "Projection of dryland subtype changes from corrected CMIP5-EM and RCP8.5 relative\
    \ to the baseline period (1961\u20131990) for 2011\u20132040, 2041\u20132070,\
    \ and 2071\u20132100."
  5: "Analysis based on observed data (1948\u20132005) and CMIP5 model simulations."
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the physical science aspects of dryland expansion and aridity,
    with implications for but not direct quantification of macroeconomic or fiscal
    impacts.
  4: The study indicates that aridity changes do not simply follow the 'dry gets drier,
    wet gets wetter' paradigm.
  5: No relevant information
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Reduced carbon sequestration, enhanced regional warming
  4: No relevant information
  5: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: "Dryland area projected to increase by 23% under RCP8.5 and 11% under RCP4.5\
    \ relative to 1961-1990 baseline, equaling 56% and 50%, respectively, of total\
    \ land surface. Warming trends over drylands are double those over humid regions.\
    \ Observed AI decreased by \u22120.050 per 58yr, while CMIP5-EM showed a decrease\
    \ of \u22120.012 per 58yr."
  4: 78% of increased drylands occur in developing countries.
  5: Projected drylands expansion to cover 56% under RCP8.5 and 50% under RCP4.5 by
    the end of the 21st century, with 78% of newly expanded drylands in developing
    countries.
