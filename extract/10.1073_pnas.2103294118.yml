Drivers of Risk:
  1: The primary driver of risk is enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations, leading
    to changes in daily temperature variability.
  2: Changes in daily temperature variability in boreal winter (DJF), boreal summer
    (JJA), and annual.
  3: "Daily temperature variability under historical (1950\u20132015) and future (2015\u2013\
    2100) greenhouse forcing specified by SSP-585."
  4: Changes in daily temperature variability due to increasing greenhouse forcing
    are the main driver of risk discussed.
  5: Changes in daily temperature variability, mean surface temperature changes, anthropogenic
    greenhouse forcing, surface warming, Arctic amplification, soil drying, changes
    in sensible and latent heat fluxes.
  6: Changes in daily temperature variability, anthropogenic greenhouse forcing, volcanic,
    solar, and aerosol forcing components
  7: Changes in daily temperature variability and its correlation with forced responses
    under greenhouse forcing are examined.
Evaluation overview:

    of surface temperature on societal outcomes, including human health, agriculture,
    and economic growth.

  6: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: The paper shows that the intramonthly variability of daily surface temperature
    changes with distinct global patterns as greenhouse gas concentrations rise. Variability
    increases at low to mid latitudes and decreases at northern mid to high latitudes
    with enhanced greenhouse forcing.
  2: Detection of historical increases in daily temperature variability in European
    summer and across the tropics and wider Southern Hemisphere.
  3: Identifies monotonically increasing patterns of change from internal, multidecadal
    climate variability with LFCA which shows a high degree of consistency both between
    models and with those identified from the reanalysis of historical observations
  4: The analysis finds a high degree of spatial similarity between the observed historical
    changes and expected model responses in annual and DJF daily temperature variability.
  5: Historically observed global patterns of change in daily temperature variability
    are extremely unlikely to occur due to natural internal variability and are consistent
    with the expected response to anthropogenic greenhouse forcing. Future changes
    in daily temperature variability will depend not only on the extent of greenhouse
    gas forcing, but also on the true climate sensitivity. Global climate models underpredict
    the extent to which daily variability changes in response to greenhouse forcing
    and surface warming, suggesting that CMIP-6 projections provide only a lower bound
    on how variability may change under future forcing scenarios.
  6: Historically observed changes in daily temperature variability are consistent
    with anthropogenic greenhouse forcing; Daily temperature variability has already
    changed by up to 40% and is projected to change by 100% by the end of the century
    under a business-as-usual scenario; Mitigation of greenhouse gases can considerably
    limit these changes; Future changes are likely to be larger than those projected
    by the CMIP-6 ensemble.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis uses reanalyses of historical observations (NOAA 20th Century Reanalysis
    Version 3 and ERA5) and a multi-model ensemble from the Coupled Model Intercomparison
    Project Phase 6 (CMIP6).
  2: Low-frequency component analysis (LFCA), an extension of traditional principal
    component analysis (PCA), identifies linearly independent modes that account for
    the greatest ratio of low frequency to total variance. Applied to historical reanalyses
    of daily temperature variability.
  3: Uses a multimodel ensemble of 10 bias-corrected Coupled Global Circulation Models
    (CGCMs) from CMIP-6 and applies Lowest-Frequency Component Analysis (LFCA) to
    calculate daily temperature variability from individual ensemble members under
    historical and future forcing, covering the period 1950 to 2100.
  4: The analysis uses pattern-correlation statistics and LFCA to assess similarity
    between historical changes and projections; it compares trends using NOAA reanalysis
    data and CMIP-6 models.
  5: Changes in daily temperature variability are estimated using the lowest-frequency
    component identified with LFCA. Patterns of change are land-area averaged. Scaling
    between variables is assessed across CMIP-6 models and forcing scenarios (SSP-126,
    SSP-585) and for different 25-year periods within individual climate models.
  6: Uses a multimodel ensemble of CMIP-6 climate models; Employs Linear Discriminant
    Analysis (LFCA) to isolate greenhouse-forced spatiotemporal signals; Assesses
    similarity between global patterns of change in daily temperature variability
    using pattern-correlation statistics
  7: Correlations of responses from reanalyses and CMIP-6 ensemble under greenhouse
    forcing are assessed against natural internal climate variability using CMIP-6
    control runs.
More Notes:
  1: The changes in daily variability are attributable to enhanced greenhouse forcing
    and would be limited by mitigation of greenhouse gases. Global changes in daily
    variability exhibit strong covariation with warming across climate models, suggesting
    that equilibrium climate sensitivity will also play a role.
  2: The NOAA 20th Century Reanalysis is used as the main specification due to its
    longer time period.
  3: The study analyzes annual and seasonal (DJF and JJA) temperature variability
    changes.
  4: There is poor agreement on projected temperature variability changes at northern
    mid to high latitudes in the JJA season.
  5: The latitudinal boundary between increasing and decreasing temperature variability
    varies considerably between models and with longitude.
  6: Biggest increases in daily temperature variability are observed in and projected
    for low-latitude regions with typically low income and low historical emissions
    of greenhouse gases, suggesting exacerbation of regional inequalities and climate
    injustices.
Quantitative material:
  1: Daily temperature variability is projected to increase by up to 100% at low latitudes
    and decrease by 40% at northern high latitudes by the end of the century under
    a business-as-usual emissions scenario.
  2: Increases and decreases of up to 40% and 20% over the past 65 y in daily temperature
    variability.
  3: "Interdecadal changes (1950\u20131960 to 2090\u20132100) due to the lowest-frequency\
    \ component are shown as colored maps."
  4: The page provides pattern-correlation statistics to quantify the similarity between
    historical observations and model projections.
  5: Historically observed variability changes are considerably larger than those
    of the CMIP-6 ensemble, given the historical level of warming.
  6: Historically observed global changes in daily temperature variability are very
    unlikely to have occurred due to natural internal climate variability; Global
    response of the high-frequency climate system has already caused changes in daily
    temperature variability of up to 40%, which are projected to change by a further
    100% by the end of the century under a business-as-usual emissions scenario
