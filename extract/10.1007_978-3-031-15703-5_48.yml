Drivers of Risk:
  11: Producing and processing food has extraordinarily high 'true cost' that is not
    captured by typical economic measures.
  25: Droughts, biofuels expansion, financial speculation after trade barriers, pandemics
    (COVID-19), armed conflicts
  60: Rising atmospheric CO2 levels can reduce crop protein and micronutrient contents,
    affecting nutritional quality.
  61: Land degradation, climate change, deforestation-induced increase in mean temperature
    and associated heat extremes, decline in rainfall, unsustainable patterns of production
    and consumption.
  66: "Stringent global climate change mitigation policy (competition for land use\
    \ for food production, bioenergy, and afforestation); Large-scale deployment of\
    \ bioenergy options (afforestation, energy crops, carbon capture and storage);\
    \ Increased demand for \uFB01sh and seafood (threatening \uFB01sheries and ocean\
    \ resources); over\uFB01shing and high waste in fisheries; Impacts of activities\
    \ such as oil drilling, energy installations, coastal development, construction\
    \ of ports and other coastal infrastructures, dams and water \uFB02ow management"
  69: "Key drivers of diet and food system change, anthropogenic GHG emissions, constraints\
    \ and barriers on trade, expansion of agriculture into fragile ecosystems, degraded\
    \ forests, \uFB01sheries, rangelands, peatlands and wetlands, climate change."
  79: Hunger and undernutrition.
  90: Production of key dietary components does not meet the required demand, even
    at the global level, therefore their prices are high; internal barriers like poorly
    developed markets mean that increased incomes do not necessarily result in increased
    consumption of healthy diets; low market access.
  124: Agrifood system transformation.
  128: Traditional pathways focused on increasing staple food supply can lead to trade-offs
    with land, energy (GHG emissions), water, and biodiversity, potentially increasing
    environmental risks.
  132: Systemic change
  135: Baseline consistent with the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World
    2020, which reported 690 million undernourished people and healthy diets being
    unaffordable for almost three billion people in the world by 2019.
  137: The needs are unevenly distributed globally, requiring significant global coordination
    and solidarity, especially to support the transformation of the agrifood systems
    of low-income countries.
  138: Various source causes of malnourishment; heterogeneous environmental trade-offs
  139: Unaffordability of healthy diets

    stress events.
  219: Global change and an increasingly interconnecting society are inducing unprecedented
    hazards.
  220: Climate change; Increasing extreme weather events.
  224: Cascading export bans and panic, government interventions, and misinformation
    in agricultural markets; disruptions posed by events like the COVID-19 pandemic.
  230: Violent conflicts, state fragility.
  232: Violent conflicts lead to destruction of agricultural areas and infrastructure,
    forced migration, and collapse of supply chains.

    patterns; Transport of concentrated feeds; Consumption of meat; Lack of market
    and processing facilities for smaller volumes of nature-positive products; Onerous
    and low-skill manual labor.
  370: Concentration of crop and livestock farming leading to leaky nutrient cycles;
    massive growth of the livestock sector leading to low nutrient use efficiency,
    increased waste, and large greenhouse gas emissions; inefficient nitrogen use
    in crop production.
  375: Pre-farm greenhouse gas emissions from fertilizer production, nutrient losses,
    and inefficient nutrient capture.
  383: Change in demand for animal source foods (ASFs) driven by population growth
    and changing consumption patterns.

    to ensure equitable access to technologies, socioeconomic and political economy
    factors affecting the deployment of bio-innovations.
  433: Gaps in R&D investment, human capital, and institutional capacity in agricultural
    research systems of LMICs (Low and Middle Income Countries).
  434: The human capital gap in LMICs affects the quality, scope, and potential of

  491: Distortions in the food system due to subsidies focused on staples, market
    incentives for commodity-based transport and hyper-processed food, and lack of
    regulations leading to externalization of costs onto environmental and healthcare
    systems.
  493: Current agricultural investments and practices often overlook the important
    potential for increasing the ecosystem services that agroecosystems can provide.
  501: Climate change and other environmental and societal changes (e.g., land use
    changes, biodiversity loss, urbanization, and changing lifestyles and diets) are
    impacting natural water cycles and water resource availability.

    food systems, anti-microbial resistance (AMR) due to food production
  600: The unaffordability of nutritious foods prevents many people from consuming
    a healthy diet. Time burden and fuel use needed to cook safe and nutritious meals
    at home, especially in households with poor kitchen facilities and other constraints,
    are also obstacles.

    and 2021 due to COVID-19
  644: Hunger
  646: The page primarily addresses investments to reduce hunger, rather than directly
    addressing climate change risks. However, it implies that lack of investment in
    areas like irrigation and soil-water management could exacerbate hunger risks,
    potentially driven by climate-related factors.
  649: Conflicts, economic fallout of COVID-19, extreme weather events, climate change
    impacts (rising temperatures, drought, intensified flooding events induced by

  798: Climate change, which facilitates the spread of pests and pathogens of plants
    and animals beyond their natural habitats; globalization and expansion of commodity
    turnover between Russia and other countries, increasing the risk of harmful organisms
    entering the country; vast territories located in the European and Asian parts
    of the continent increasing risks of epizootic and epiphytotic situations.
  806: Decrease in global prices affecting exports, while imports kept increasing
    after 2013-14.
  808: Overuse of groundwater due to power subsidies; climate change leading to droughts

    land use and water flow, impact of dams on water availability, fishing opportunities,
    and ecosystem.
  866: No relevant information
  883: Fluctuations in food prices during the food system transition; LMICs being
    less able to resource necessary transition steps; the poorest being least able
    to afford nutrient-rich food alternatives.
  884: Disruption to trade, protectionism, price fluctuations, and resource constraints
    in LMICs are key drivers of risk.
  886: Financial constraints in LMICs, mismatch between actors needing resources and
    those benefiting, powerful business interests in status quo, limited resources
    in a post-COVID-19 world, political risks of policy change.
  907: Climate change, biodiversity loss, and adverse health effects associated with
    food systems create external costs.
  917: Excessive nitrogen use from fertilizer subsidies, agricultural production contributing
    to global warming, nutrient pollution, degradation of water quantity and quality,
    biodiversity loss, and soil degradation, climate action requiring curtailing greenhouse
    gas-intensive products.
  920: Reducing food loss and waste leads to environmental improvement, but not necessarily
    a reduction in net agricultural emissions and AFOLU, as well as forest land.
Highlights:
  11: The 'true cost' of food production ($30 trillion) vastly outweighs the cost
    of overcoming hunger ($50 billion).
  60: Climate change poses a significant risk to agricultural systems and food supplies
    globally, with potential reductions in crop yields and changes in availability
    and affordability of food.
  61: Land degradation and climate change could reduce global crop yields significantly,
    particularly impacting India, China, and sub-Saharan Africa, potentially displacing
    hundreds of millions of people. Deforestation contributes to temperature increases
    and rainfall declines, threatening agricultural productivity in the tropics and
    the livelihoods of billions.
  69: The costs of acting and not acting on key drivers of diet and food system change
    are required for effective decision-making.
  79: Hunger and undernutrition have cost countries between 2% and 17% of their GDP.
  90: A healthy diet is unaffordable for a significant portion of the global population,
    particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia.
  127: The paper proposes using a simple set of policy instruments to illustrate core
    trade-offs in agrifood systems. The instruments include producer subsidies, consumption
    subsidies, and a carbon tax. A progressive tax system is also considered for household
    redistribution.
  128: Traditional production-focused approaches to reducing undernourishment can
    have negative trade-offs with environmental outcomes, whereas alternative pathways
    can achieve synergies and reduce negative impacts. A coordinated policy response
    involving multiple ministries is needed.
  130: The MIRAGRODEP CGE model provides an integrated framework where economic and
    biophysical constraints can be implemented and markets will clear in a consistent
    way.
  135: "To cover the income gap of the three billion people who \u2013 without action\
    \ - will not be able to afford healthy diets in 2030, countries will have to redistribute\
    \ 1.4 trillion dollars (constant 2017) annually."
  137: Safety nets alone are too expensive to ensure everyone can afford healthy diets.
    Combining different interventions reduces the cost of safety nets substantially.
  138: No single intervention can achieve the end of malnourishment; synergies are
    needed to tackle the various source causes of the problem and minimize the total
    cost of the package; complementarity goes beyond impacts on household food security
    and cost-effectiveness and they need to be combined to address heterogeneous environmental
    trade-offs; 'Full Package w/o Safety Nets' has the highest total reduction in
    undernourishment
  139: A 'Full Package w/ Safety Nets' intervention can lead to approximately 600
    million people gaining access to healthy diets by 2030, with a significant portion
    in low-income countries; Safety Nets for Healthy Diets represent the largest segment
    of global annual food spending projections in 2030.
  141: Ending chronic hunger is possible by 2030 with structural interventions; Interventions
    can create synergies that address different causes of hunger and minimize the
    total cost of interventions; Policies stimulating investments in innovations for
    carbon farming are needed.
  144: The key highlight is the trade-off between different agricultural outputs (Maize
    and Pulses) and the impact of policies (e.g., taxes) on these trade-offs. The
    analysis also highlights the impact of the Green Revolution on agricultural production.
  146: Illustrates how past weather data can be used to assess the risk exposure of
    various populations (example of select provinces in the DRC)
  161: Policies of social distancing and measures to contain the pandemic have drastically
    affected food supply chains, with serious repercussions for the poor and vulnerable.
  182: There is a gender disparity in capacities to mitigate risk and respond to shocks
    due to differing social norms and resource access.
  219: The importance of diversification for enhancing food systems resilience.
  220: Diversification of agricultural production (crops, cropping systems, agricultural
    landscapes, regions, aquaculture, vertical and urban farming) at different organizational
    levels (field, farm, landscape, regional scale, and broader food system) can build
    resilience to climate change and extreme weather events, improve ecological performance,
    and deliver additional ecosystem services.
  224: Trade can mediate between food surplus and food deficit regions, but this is
    only possible under a rules-based system with adequate information.
  230: The map visualizes the intersection of conflict, state fragility, and food
    insecurity in Africa and parts of the Middle East.
  232: The destruction and collapse of infrastructure during violent conflicts lead
    to long-term food insecurity.

  301: No relevant information
  334: The trade-off between high yields and biodiversity-rich, non-commodity ecosystem
    services is the greatest challenge at present.
  342: Nature-positive farming systems can boost farm incomes and livelihoods and
    revitalize rural areas; Requires better information dissemination, integration
    of sustainable nutrition into school curricula, personalized shopping guidance,
    and nudging campaigns; Local value addition and regional networks are important.
  370: Cropland nitrogen surplus is a significant issue, particularly in densely farmed
    areas of Asia. Sustainable livestock production includes more pasture-based systems
    and reintegration of crop and livestock farming.
  383: Global per capita demand for animal source foods increased significantly between
    1990 and 2015, but this trend varies substantially across regions and commodities.
    Poultry and pork drove the increase in meat demand, while ruminant meat demand
    remained relatively stable.
  386: The monogastric 'explosion' has led to significant growth in animal production,
    especially in developing regions like Africa and Asia.
  387: The figure illustrates production trends for Milk, Eggs, Bovine Meat, Mutton
    & Goat Meat, Pigmeat, and Poultry Meat across various regions (World, Africa,
    Americas, Asia, Europe, Oceania).
  390: Very small farms are particularly important in China for bovine milk and meat
    production. Smallholder monogastric systems are important sources of pork, poultry,
    and eggs in South and Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
  391: Despite productivity improvements, the aggregate environmental impacts of livestock
    have continued to grow due to increased demand; Intact ecosystems are being converted
    to pasture and feed crops for animals, impacting climate change mitigation.
  397: Reducing the consumption of ASFs is to reduce the land footprint of livestock.
    The largest technical potential comes from reductions in ruminant meat consumption.
    Reductions in livestock product consumption, especially red meats, could have
    both environmental and health benefits.
  398: There is a lack of information on the socio-economic impacts of reduced ASF
    demand, including effects on farmers' livelihoods, agricultural GDP, and employment.
  400: Sustainability in livestock production requires economic incentive systems
    and regulatory measures for emissions, watershed, and biodiversity protection.
  427: "CRISPR-Cas9 technologies can produce new varieties that resemble \u201Cnature-identical\u201D\
    \ variants which may be more resistant to disease, poor environmental conditions,\
    \ and climate change; include desired agronomic and nutritional traits; and require\
    \ fewer inputs."
  429: Regulatory delays can reduce access to valuable technologies and affect market
    entry. There is a critical need to ensure and secure continued development of
    novel mechanisms to facilitate IP access for pro-poor innovations.
  433: LMICs with lagging research systems account for only 3% of total R&D investment
    in LMICs and show considerably slower agricultural productivity growth. LMICs
    with average research systems trail those with advanced research systems in terms
    of R&D investment and long-term agricultural productivity growth. Lagging and
    average countries could make enormous progress if R&D efforts were stepped up.
  434: Countries with lagging and average agricultural research systems have a much
    higher investment gap than countries with advanced systems. LMICs spend only 3-6%
    of total government spending on agriculture, and only a fraction of that is allocated
    to R&D.
  450: Digital agriculture programs can lead to positive yield gains and are significantly
    more cost-effective than traditional advisory services.

    and provide an asset class that generates inclusive economic growth.
  476: Agricultural lands should transition to being treated as 'agroecosystems' to
    ensure environmental and climate security by 2030.
  490: Agriculture has the potential to reconcile food/nutritional security with environmental
    and climate security by placing biodiversity at the heart of agriculture policy,
    investment and innovation.
  493: Increased research focus on diverse farming systems rather than individual
    commodities is needed.
  515: New projections by AgMIP suggest markedly more pessimistic yield responses
    for maize, soybean, and rice, compared to the original ensemble.
  517: "Climate change will increase food price instability and reduce the quality\
    \ of food, undermining people\u2019s ability to access food in a stable way. Furthermore,\
    \ food systems contribute significantly to GHG emissions, exacerbating climate\
    \ change."
  525: Existing practices, technologies, and social knowledge can be leveraged for
    climate change mitigation and adaptation, with additional benefits like biodiversity
    conservation.
  537: No relevant information
  538: Long-term and ecosystem benefits of agroecology can be higher.
  545: Loss of crop diversity poses a considerable risk to global food security because
    the genetic diversity of cultivated plant species is the raw material of crop
    improvement.
  551: The issuance of a 30-year Food Security Bond is being explored to engage private
    investors and government donors to support crop diversity conservation.
  559: No relevant information
  569: Food loss and waste reduction has both benefits and costs that must be considered
    for efficient solutions.
  571: Increased commitment is needed from national, regional, and global leaders
    to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reduce
    food losses along production and supply chains by 2030 (SDG 12.3).
  589: The true cost of food is disproportionally high compared to the current market
    price. Health costs associated with diets are a significant contributor to the
    overall cost of food.
  590: The total annual true cost of food, including external costs, is estimated
    to be above 30 trillion dollars (PPP); Land use is the largest contributor to
    the annual environmental cost of food systems.
  593: UNFSS stakeholders should identify externalities as hidden costs in the food
    system, quantify them through TCA, and reduce or eliminate them through policies.
    Estimating the full scope of these costs is a priority for determining if such
    an adjustment to the food system would increase food prices to a point where a
    reassessment of poverty lines is necessary.
  600: A nutritious diet is unaffordable for about 40% of the world's population.
  602: Information is presented on food prices and the equivalent kcal obtained from
    different food sources to determine the affordability of a basic meal, including
    the potential for substitution between food items.
  604: Switching from dry beans to canned beans adds as much cost as switching to
    red meat or poultry. Tinned fish is about the same cost per 100 kcal as uncooked
    raw red meat or poultry.
  605: Pre-cooked pulses are much more expensive than dried pulses, while canned fish
    is less expensive than fresh fish. More convenient versions of foods generally
    have higher price premiums compared to their less processed counterparts, relative
    to a baseline carbohydrate.

  622: Ending hunger by 2030 could be achieved without prohibitive costs if a mix
    of least-cost measures with large hunger reduction potential are prioritized.
  624: Pro-poor investments can reduce hunger.
  635: Under the worst scenario (high population growth, economic stagnation, high-income
    inequality, and climate change), the number of undernourished people is expected
    to be between 617 and 842 million in 2030.
  636: COVID-19 is expected to accelerate the projected increase in hunger. The study
    uses a projection that considers the impact of COVID-19 as the reference scenario
    for the population at risk of hunger in 2030.
  637: The measures included in the MACC have the potential to lift over a billion
    people out of hunger over ten years between 2020 and 2030.
  638: Investment in R&D and extension services is crucial for improving agricultural
    efficiency and reducing hunger, with quantifiable impacts on yield and GDP.
  640: Analysis focuses on the potential of various interventions (nitrogen-use efficiency,
    integrated soil fertility management, ICT, infrastructure, electricity) to reduce
    poverty and hunger in developing countries.
  643: "Investing in agricultural R&D efficiency enhancement, agricultural extension\
    \ services, and ICT \u2013 Agricultural information systems are low-cost options\
    \ with relatively large hunger reduction potential."
  644: Least-cost rank of interventions (1 to 11) to address hunger; cumulative amount
    in USD spent on interventions.
  646: Investments contribute to long-term development and sustainability, beyond
    2030 and not restricted to hunger reduction. Marginal cost curve elements include
    investments that contribute to long-term development and sustainability, beyond
    2030 and not restricted to hunger reduction.
  649: Climate change impacts not only hunger levels but also the costs and potential
    of the targeted hunger prevention interventions. The paper argues that hunger
    crises today and of the future are fundamentally humanitarian and conflict resolution
    issues rather than shortcomings with agri-food systems.
  652: Achieving SDG 2.1 (zero hunger) need not be prohibitively expensive if least-cost
    measures are prioritized; Investments to end hunger are modest compared to COVID-19
    economic rescue packages; MACC analysis has the potential to lift a billion people
    out of hunger by 2030.
  662: Globally, government outlays for agriculture, forestry, and fisheries (AFF)
    averaged 2.0% of total government outlays between 2014-2019.
  665: Developing countries show far smaller AOIs than developed countries, and values
    for Africa are lower than for other developing regions.
  666: There seem to be enough aggregate resources (except, perhaps, in the case of
    banking systems for the 1 billion target) to achieve SDG2 and end hunger.
  668: International development funds should be used more strategically to leverage
    and mobilize private funds. Multilateral and bilateral organizations should better
    coordinate their own operations.
  675: The Zero Hunger Alliance & Fund can play a central role in achieving the end
    of hunger.
  677: Proposes the creation of a Zero Hunger Alliance & Fund to support country-owned
    programs to end hunger.
  681: Agricultural and food trade plays a crucial role in moving food globally from
    surplus to deficit regions, ensuring food security. Trade can balance different
    aspects of sustainability from a global perspective.
  689: Climate change will impact agricultural net trade, with some regions becoming
    net importers and others net exporters; Trade can be an adaptation mechanism,
    with free trade potentially lowering food prices in adversely affected regions.
  709: Rising incomes and a growing middle class in Africa are increasing demand for
    animal-source foods, impacting food security and nutrition.
  737: Technological change in agriculture should be accompanied by policies targeting
    equitable access and participation, particularly for small-scale family agriculture.
  738: Improved international cooperation mechanisms are needed to pool capacities
    and share technology for food security, particularly for smaller tropical countries;
    Development of national/regional innovation ecosystems is essential; Solid linkage
    networks with regional public R&D systems and agricultural extension, and with
    the private sector are fundamental to achieving greater efficiencies.
  770: Between 1990 and 2020, the prevalence of undernutrition in China dropped from
    22.9% to below 2.5%.
  772: China has become the first developing country to meet the Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs) target one decade ahead of schedule.

  782: China aims to stabilize grain production and achieve carbon neutrality while
    increasing the resilience of its agricultural and food systems against external
    shocks.
  788: The future of the Russian agrifood sector will be determined by the impact
    of technological transitions, changes in value chains, the influence of large
    companies, and shifting consumer demand.
  806: India became a net exporter of agricultural produce with significant growth
    in agricultural exports, resulting in a net surplus in agri-trade during earlier
    years, indicating globalization competitiveness.
  808: Over-exploitation of groundwater, especially in north-west India, is a major
    challenge. Climate change will exacerbate food security issues through droughts
    and floods, with significant impacts on wheat production.
  814: The current food subsidy system is expensive and inefficient, calling for a
    re-examination of its coverage and suggesting reforms such as reducing coverage
    to ~30% of the population and direct cash transfers.
  835: No relevant information.
  837: The bioeconomy significantly contributes to sustainable economic growth and
    employment, particularly in the EU and Argentina.
  842: Bioeconomic developments can transform rural environments by improving energy
    availability and attracting other economic activities.
  848: GM crops contribute to improving the sustainability of agriculture and food
    production by reducing GHG emissions, increasing carbon dioxide sequestration,
    and improving photosynthesis, thus mitigating climate change. The bioeconomy can
    play a central role in addressing challenges like climate change and food security,
    especially through upscaling biotechnology innovations.
  866: No relevant information
  883: A key challenge for policymakers is ensuring the transition reduces inequality
    rather than increasing it.
  884: Transitioning food systems requires policy actions at international and national
    levels to reduce inequality. LMICs should focus on repurposing expenditure, cost-neutral
    actions, private sector partnerships, and evidence-based prioritization.
  886: Limited actions by countries in improving diet quality are seen as a missed
    opportunity due to policy focus issues, private sector mismatch, and public sector
    costs.
  907: Environmental and health externalities from food systems are substantial, more
    than doubling the apparent cost of food when accounted for.
  917: Synergies and trade-offs exist between innovations and actions in food systems;
    understanding these is critical for maximizing effectiveness. Food systems are
    connected to transformations in health, energy, environment, and economic systems.
    Trade-offs include agricultural production's contribution to environmental degradation
    and climate action requirements.
  920: Policies are needed to stimulate investments in innovation for carbon farming
    and related payment schemes for ecosystem services.
Methodology:
  69: Food system compass based on bottom-up pathways developed at the national scale
    to reach food systems targets supporting an ensemble of global-scale and integrative
    food system models; capacity development for comprehensive foresight, scenario
    and predictive modelling; Monitoring change and progress via frequently collected
    nutrition and poverty data; Innovative indicators such as the affordability of

  123: Uses a global, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model called MIRAGRODEP,
    which is dynamic, multisectoral, and generates unique market equilibria. This
    model incorporates structural equations and optimization programs with constraints
    for economic agents.
  124: The MIRAGRODEP model is a CGE (Computable General Equilibrium) model with integration
    with household data and the use of detailed household information. It is based
    on a set of macro and sectoral accounts updated for 2017 using the GTAP database
    of social accounting matrices and is compatible with FAO food balance sheets,
    the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2020s, and a large dataset
    on farm and trade policies (Ag-Incentives project). It is also compatible with
    various emissions databases and satellite accounts, and the household dataset
    is based on the POVANA database.
  127: The paper uses a structural model to analyze different pathways to achieve
    goals like eliminating hunger. The model can be used to tailor a story in an ad
    hoc way or to define an optimal mix of instruments, taking into account constraints
    (fiscal optimization, social preferences).
  128: The paper uses a systems-thinking approach to develop policy packages that
    simultaneously reduce the prevalence of undernourishment and greenhouse gas emissions.
    It includes an analytical and formal representation in the Appendix for integrating
    various objectives in a modeling framework.
  129: The model considers labor market differentiation by gender and mobility restrictions
    for labor and land.
  130: The paper uses the MIRAGRODEP CGE model, an integrated framework for economic
    and biophysical constraints, to analyze the impact of agricultural support policies
    on emissions.
  132: 'Uses a MIRAGRODEP CGE model. Two approaches are described: (1) Implementing
    variables from the CGE model into harmonized household surveys, allowing assessment
    of impacts on households. (2) Incorporating a large set of households directly
    into the CGE model in a bottom-up way. The first approach can include first or
    second order impacts.'
  133: The analysis is performed using the MIRAGRODEP CGE (Computable General Equilibrium)
    framework, which includes a satellite account to generate indicators related to
    agrifood systems.
  135: "The results are based on modeling scenarios organized around three main pillars:\
    \ achievement of a more ef\uFB01cient and more inclusive system, allowing consumers\
    \ and producers to make better choices."
  137: Modeling of actions for transforming agrifood systems, including increased
    livestock genetics, extension services, reduced food waste and loss, and land
    use regulation.
  138: Analysis of the impact of different interventions on reducing chronic undernourishment
    by 2030.
  139: Modeling of actions for transforming agrifood systems, projecting impacts to
    2030.
  141: Uses a dynamic global Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, MIRAGRODEP,
    which includes many household groups and is combined with land use, farm, and
    livestock components; Six interventions are modeled to study their impact on agrifood
    systems, undernutrition, and the environment.
  142: Optimization program framework to minimize hunger (measured as Prevalence of
    Undernourishment - PoU) subject to constraints. Uses duality principle from microeconomics.
  144: The paper uses an optimization framework to find the minimal level of poverty
    compatible with certain objectives, and to minimize public expenditures subject
    to constraints related to SDGs and GHG emissions. The results are applicable to
    a globally aggregated agricultural system, assuming constant labor in agriculture
    and no trade.

  397: The technical mitigation potential of changing diets is examined in literature
    according to a range of scenarios.
  398: The paper calls for methodological advances to simultaneously elicit the environmental,
    health, and socio-economic impacts of reduced consumption of ASFs, and calls for
    more realistic and culturally sensitive regional variants to be examined in these
    scenarios. Future analysis should better recognize the heterogeneity of populations
    (rural/urban, under-or over-nourished, gender, age, or by age groups).

  569: Adopts a value-chain approach to defining food loss and waste. Considers economic,
    caloric, and quality-adjusted weight terms for measurement.
  587: A True Cost Accounting (TCA) assessment typically starts by identifying the
    goal and scope of the assessment, establishing the unit of analysis and the system
    boundaries. Then, various externalities are assessed (qualitatively or quantitatively),
    valued and aggregated. The core unit of analysis for a UNFSS working group was
    the global food system, consisting of global food consumption and production,
    divided by country and food group.
  588: The externalities were modeled per food group based on the Willett et al. (2019)
    health reference diet and expenditure on food groups, and production data per
    country and food group. The environmental effects of imports were based on a global
    average of the environmental effects of exports per food group.
  589: Monetization of environmental externalities based on country-level monetization
    factors for restoration and compensation costs. Meta-study by the OECD (2012)
    used to monetize the loss of human life. Average value used to estimate the direct
    and indirect economic effects of health loss.
  590: Analysis includes quantifying and valuing the environmental and health impacts
    of diets. Acknowledges uncertainty in quantifying biodiversity and pollution impacts,
    as well as health impacts due to methodological choices around attribution, consumer
    rationality, reference scenarios, and valuation of statistical life.
  593: Total Cost Accounting (TCA) practices are recommended for quantifying externalities
    and identifying pathways to reduce or eliminate them. Integration of TCA into
    national accounts and GDP is suggested to provide a standardized account of inclusive
    welfare.

  602: Analysis of the cost and composition of a basic meal using detailed food composition
    data and prices from the ICP and WFP.
  604: The analysis examines the added cost of lightly processed items and alternative
    proteins at the item level to address food choice within the overall diet.
  605: The data shows global average premiums using an OLS regression with fixed effects
    for each of 168 countries in 2017, covering 2,194 food items.
  610: The paper uses reference food items and their energy content to analyze the
    cost and affordability of preparing a basic meal around the world, which can be
    used as a measure of food security and nutritional needs
  622: A marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) was developed to identify least-cost
    investment options with the highest potential for hunger reduction.
  624: Global Agricultural model
  635: Bio-economic model-based assessments of AIM/CGE, GLOBIOM and IMPACT models
    are used to project food security outcomes under various climatic and socio-economic
    scenarios.
  636: The MACC analysis determines the number of undernourished people needing to
    be lifted out of hunger to achieve SDG 2 target 2.1 by 2030, using projections
    that consider the impact of COVID-19 as the reference scenario. Costs and hunger
    reduction potential of investments are analyzed relative to a 'business as usual'
    investment scenario where costs remain frozen or grow following historical trends.
  637: A Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) of hunger reduction potential was elaborated
    by ranking interventions according to their average cost per undernourished individual.

  646: The paper uses a Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) of hunger reduction to
    prioritize efforts and allocate investments to achieve the global goal of ending
    hunger, but it is subject to various uncertainties due to various assumptions
    made in the calculations.
  649: The studies reviewed in the analysis were conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic
    and did not consider the impacts of such an event or similar pandemics. Estimating
    the cost of conflict resolution, such as diplomatic and peace keeping engagements,
    and impacts on other interventions would be multifaceted and quite complex and
    hence was not considered.
  652: Synthesis of model- and cost-benefit analysis-based studies on food and nutrition

More Notes:
  11: The document highlights the need for innovative financing solutions to support
    investments needed for achieving SDG2 goals and ending hunger and the role of
    trade policies.
  25: The paper discusses de-risking food systems as a priority and suggests policy
    and economic solutions such as insurance products, solar powered irrigation, and
    smart-phone apps for farmers. It also highlights the importance of protecting
    equality and rights, particularly land rights of smallholders, women, and indigenous
    peoples.
  61: The paper emphasizes the need for a structural transformation of food systems
    and a global social compact to ensure food and nutrition security.
  66: The paper highlights the need for ensuring food prices reflect real costs including
    externalities caused by climate change, land and water resource degradation and
    biodiversity loss.
  69: Highlights the need for improved international cooperation and coordination
    of the food system, including the establishment of a thorough monitoring, evaluation,
    and early warning system with comprehensive indicators, transparency, and commitments
    from all stakeholders.
  90: The page focuses on the affordability and accessibility of healthy diets, primarily
    analyzing the reasons why large populations cannot afford a healthy diet. It suggests
    that supply and demand issues, poorly developed markets, and low market access
    are key barriers. While it does not explicitly mention macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes related to climate change adaptation, it does point to factors that can
    impact productivity and economic well-being.
  123: The MIRAGRODEP model allows for the investigation of different definitions
    of agrifood systems and can be paired with other models to provide inputs or extend
    results.
  124: The MIRAGRODEP model has contributed to policy and political processes in various
    countries. The modeling initiative builds on existing partnerships to extend its
    scope.
  128: The analysis focuses on Country X, which has a high prevalence of undernourishment
    and a large livestock sector. The example is specific to SDGs 1, 2, 3 and 4 and
    the graphical model shown in Figure 2. The efficacy of production subsidies are
    considered in a global context.
  130: The model focuses on representing market equilibria for goods and factors of
    production to capture real income impacts and their social implications. The model
    is designed to be integrated with other modeling platforms.
  132: GIS tagging available in some surveys can be used to illustrate within-country
    heterogeneity.
  133: The model currently operates under perfect competition, which may lead to optimistic
    views on inequalities. Addressing imperfect competition within the model is identified
    as a major research question. The model could incorporate dynamic equations about
    soil quality productivity as a new form of capital in the farm sectors. The framework
    also lacks household data for developed countries.
  137: The analysis suggests a need for global coordination and solidarity to support
    the transformation of agrifood systems in low-income countries.
  138: "The interventions considered are Social Safety Net, School Feeding Program,\
    \ Farm Subsidy Repurposing, Consumer\u2019s incentive Reform, Innovation, Technology\
    \ and Knowledge for Farmers, and Reducing Food Waste and Loss. The effectiveness\
    \ of interventions varies by country income level (High, Middle, and Low)."
  139: The actions modeled will generate trade-offs in regard to GHG emissions, agricultural
    land, an increase in the use of chemical inputs, and biodiversity.
  141: The model explicitly represents household heterogeneity and inequalities. The
    model aims to capture macroeconomic linkages, multisectoral interactions within
    agrifood systems, and interactions for different households, including the poor
    and most vulnerable.
  144: The analysis uses two-dimensional choices for the sake of visual representation
    and does not consider trade or other economic activities. The paper uses production
    possibility frontiers (PPF) to illustrate trade-offs between Maize and Pulses.
  146: The paper uses an iso-utility function to represent social preferences, where
    the origin represents the ideal (but unachievable) state of 0 Poverty and 0 GHG
    emissions.
  161: There are significant knowledge gaps concerning rural out-migration trends,
    particularly for migration driven by distress, with a need for reliable, disaggregated
    data.
  162: This page focuses on the impact of shocks, particularly COVID-19, on vulnerable
    populations and does not directly address climate change or adaptation costs/benefits.
    The discussion is centered around equity, vulnerability, and pre-existing conditions
    that exacerbate the impact of shocks.
  182: The analysis has context-specific findings with limited generalizability across
    different geographic scales.

  220: The page focuses on the importance of diversifying food production systems
    as a means of building resilience to climate change but does not provide specific
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes.
  224: The AMIS (Agricultural Market Information System) was initiated to improve
    market information and document government interventions.
  301: This page focuses on recommendations for urban food systems, specifically upgrading
    MSMEs and changing consumer environments to enable healthier food while keeping
    costs affordable. It does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks
    of climate change or the costs and benefits of adaptation at a national level.
  342: Shift towards plant proteins, meat substitutes, insects grown on organic waste,
    and algae are discussed as potential solutions.
  370: The paper suggests that improving soil health is important for increasing the
    resilience of farming systems to extreme climatic events. Global livestock supply
    chains account for one-third of all human-induced nitrogen emissions.
  383: The page focuses on trends in demand for animal source foods, without explicitly
    linking these trends to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks or adaptation costs
    and benefits.
  387: The visualization indicates changes in animal product production over time
    and across geographic regions, potentially useful for assessing regional vulnerabilities
    and adaptation needs in the livestock sector.
  390: Suggests a negative relationship between the proportion of extensively raised
    chickens and pigs and the GDP per capita of different countries; economies grow,
    the smallholder monogastric sector will tend to reduce in importance as income
    grows and conditions become more favourable for private industry to industrialise
    the sector.
  391: The paper focuses on the environmental impacts of livestock production, particularly
    greenhouse gas emissions and land use change. It highlights the trade-off between
    increased productivity and the growing demand for livestock products, leading
    to overall environmental degradation.
  397: The economic mitigation potential of changing diets is not known and a crucial
    research area.
  398: The paper argues that current studies often use kilocalories as the currency
    for changing diets, overlooking the importance of protein and micronutrients,
    particularly from livestock. Mitigation of greenhouse gases from livestock depends
    on livelihood objectives of livestock farmers.

  408: The paper discusses the role of blue foods in supporting healthy diets and
    resilience in the face of climate change, primarily in the context of vulnerable
    communities and small-scale fisheries/aquaculture. It highlights the potential
    of blue foods to contribute to healthier food systems, but also acknowledges challenges
    related to sustainable management and environmental impacts.
  427: The adoption of biotechnology applications varies across developing economies
    because of differences in R&D capacity, delivery, adoption, and benefits. These
    differences often reflect disparities in socioeconomic and political factors.
  434: There's a significant human capital gap in LMICs, with a lower percentage of
    agricultural researchers holding PhD degrees compared to advanced countries or
    Brazil, China, and India.
  454: No relevant information
  467: This page focuses on the role of food system innovation hubs in LMICs and their
    potential to accelerate innovation, support sustainable agriculture, and create
    consumer demand for healthy foods. While it doesn't explicitly quantify macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes related to climate change adaptation, it suggests that these
    hubs can contribute to building more resilient and sustainable food systems, which
    could indirectly mitigate climate-related risks to food security and economic
    stability. The paper also identifies SMEs in LMICs face unique constraints compared
    to developed nations.
  476: Investments in research, practices, technologies, and incentives are necessary
    for rewarding farmers both for food and environmental services they produce.
  491: The paper emphasizes the need to address trade distortions and inequitable
    trade relationships between developed and developing countries resulting from
    heavily subsidized agricultural sectors in the Global North.
  515: Previous projections of climate change impacts on future crop yields underestimated
    the extent of potential yield declines.
  537: This page focuses on agroecology's role in climate change adaptation and mitigation
    within agriculture, primarily at the farm or system level. It does not explicitly
    address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level.
  545: The paper focuses on plant genetic resources within agriculture as a driver
    of risk.
  551: No relevant information
  559: This page focuses on safeguarding and using fruit and vegetable biodiversity
    through activities like school feeding programs, promoting local crops, and conserving
    genetic resources. It does not contain information about the macroeconomic or
    macro-fiscal impacts of climate change or the costs and benefits of adaptation
    at a national level.
  569: The alliance of actors must become broader in order to make significant improvements
    globally in reducing FLAW.
  571: The paper proposes increased commitment and actions to reduce food loss and
    waste (FLAW).
  587: There is limited information available at the national scale due to the young
    nature of TCA and the complexity of food chains.
  588: The study excludes economic externalities, social externalities, some environmental
    externalities (soil degradation, depletion of non-renewable resources, land use
    other than cropland, overuse of renewable resources, other air pollutants than
    NH3), and health costs such as antibiotic resistance, zoonoses and undernutrition,
    as well as productivity losses due to disease. The value chain scope for environmental
    externalities was primary production, feed for animal products, and inputs such
    as nitrogen and phosphate. Transportation, processing, and food preparation costs
    were not considered.
  589: There is substantial uncertainty in the estimates due to incomplete coverage
    of impacts, uncertainties in primary and trade data, uncertainties in modeling
    impact pathways, and uncertainty in the monetization of external costs.
  590: The analysis excludes some relevant externalities like undernutrition, zoonoses,
    AMR, productivity losses due to diseases, soil degradation, land use other than
    cropland, and depleted resources. There is a need for more research to quantify
    these externalities and social costs. Lack of a quantified dietary guide aligned
    with UNFSS ambitions limits comprehensive analysis.
  593: The bioavailability and quality of protein and nutrients were not considered
    in the dietary shifts. The analysis focuses on internalizing externalities and
    incentivizing sustainable practices within the food system.
  600: This paper focuses on the microeconomic aspect of food affordability and the
    obstacles to improved diet quality. It does not directly address the macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal risks of climate change or the costs and benefits of adaptation
    at a national level.
  602: The analysis focuses on the affordability of a basic meal based on the prices
    of food items like grains, pulses, oils, and animal-sourced protein, as well as
    staple vegetables. Images provide visual representation of the food items considered
    in the analysis.
  604: No relevant information
  605: The analysis uses the cost of cooking beans in East Africa as an example to
    address differences in fuel cost as one influence on the cost and affordability
    of food.
  610: The page focuses on defining reference food items and their energy content,
    which form the basis for calculating the cost of a basic meal.
  624: 'The study uses a global agricultural model that includes biophysical models
    and climate change to analyze food supply and demand. Investments/interventions
    considered include: agriculture, natural resources, agro-processing, infrastructure,
    institutional R&D, and Social Agricultural R&D'
  635: The magnitude of hunger reduction differs across modelling assessments.
  636: The paper compares investment options to a reference scenario to identify the
    incremental cost of implementing the investments.
  637: The MACC includes interventions related to agricultural productivity, food
    distribution efficiency, and social safety nets.
  638: The analysis considers different scenarios and options related to agricultural
    investments, including R&D, extension, and irrigation.
  640: The interventions being modelled are Rail, Road, Agricultural services, reduction
    in Food loss, and value chain improvements. The study uses data from FAO, Rosegrant
    et al., Hoddinott et al. and others.
  643: The figure is subject to considerable uncertainty given various assumptions
    made in the calculation, missed synergies, potential overlap between interventions,
    and impact of extreme events not considered when estimating the costs.
  644: Interventions include agricultural, social protection, ICT, and R&D programs;
    the results are specific to hunger and do not address broader macroeconomic or
    fiscal outcomes.
  646: "The study acknowledges that the estimates presented might understate the full\
    \ benefits of these investments because lagged benefits and impacts on development\
    \ outcomes beyond hunger have not been considered. The cost level of \u2018Agricultural\
    \ R&D efficiency enhancement\u2019 is subject to \u2018high\u2019 uncertainty\
    \ and hunger reduction potential is subject to \u2018moderate\u2019 uncertainty.\
    \ The cost of \u2018Agricultural extension services\u2019 is characterized with\
    \ \u2018low\u2019 uncertainty but its hunger reduction potential is characterized\
    \ with \u2018high\u2019 uncertainty."
  649: Investment options reviewed in this study did not explicitly include climate
    change or the effects of extreme events on hunger reduction.

    priorities of those who could mobilize resources are not sufficiently oriented
    toward overcoming hunger.
  665: The page discusses capital markets and socially/environmentally-oriented investments
    as potential sources of funds for food system transformation. It also mentions
    the issuance of Green Bonds (260 billion USD in 2019) and Social Bonds (131 billion
    USD in 2020).
  666: The analysis considers what amount of available financial resources there are,
    whether some of them can be reallocated towards desired objectives, and if that
    is not enough, then where the additional money may come from.
  677: The paper suggests using 2% of new SDR allocations to guarantee 'zero hunger
    bonds'.
  681: The paper focuses on the role of agricultural and food trade in ensuring food
    security and sustainability, highlighting the importance of comparative advantage
    derived from natural resource endowments and environmental conditions. The COVID-19
    pandemic has fueled fears about the functioning of global agricultural and food
    trade.
  689: Increased transport due to trade expansion can add to GHG emissions, negating
    some climate change mitigation efforts; Subsistence food requirements in developing
    countries could drive specialization towards agriculture, exacerbating losses
    from climate change.
  709: Africa is experiencing a widening food import gap due to higher food demand,
    impacting food production systems and foreign exchange resources.

    land improvement. The government initiated the first national program to protect
    natural resources in 2016 and implemented a series of directories and regulations
    to tackle environmental degradation and restore the agroecosystem. Regulations
    have been issued to manage livestock waste, agricultural plastics, and the overuse
    of fertilizers and pesticides, with a decline in fertilizer and pesticide use
    since the mid-2010s.
  779: Increasingly scarce resources, including land, water and raw materials puts
    pressure on society.
  781: This page focuses on China's agricultural trade and food security policies,

  141: Ending chronic hunger at a 5% level by 2030 is possible; Increased farm productivity
    and reduction of food loss and waste could cut the number of chronically hungry
    people by 314 million; 568 million people would be able to afford healthy diets
    by 2030; The cost of ending hunger represents 8% of the size of global food markets;
    Well-targeted social safety nets could provide an additional 2.4 billion people
    with access to healthy diets.
  142: Countries would have to redistribute $1.4 trillion annually to fill the income
    gap of the 3 billion people who cannot afford healthy diets. Investing in interventions
    can drive down the cost of safety nets by about two thirds, or $428 billion, globally
    in 2030.
