Drivers of Risk:
  1: Uncertainties in projections of climate change impacts on crop production, particularly
    due to temperature sensitivity, are a significant driver of risk.
  2: Temperature and precipitation changes impacting crop production.
  3: Changes in growing season average temperature and precipitation.
  5: Changes in temperature (T) and precipitation (P).
  7: Uncertainties in average growing season temperature changes, crop responses to
    temperature changes, and, to a lesser extent, changes in precipitation; extreme
    events, pests, diseases, changes in solar radiation.
Highlights:
  1: Temperature uncertainties have a greater impact on crop production uncertainty
    than precipitation uncertainties.
  2: Rainfall variability is a critical driver of year-to-year production for crops,
    but temperature plays a dominant role in contributing factors to variance in most
    cases.
  3: Uncertainty surrounding temperature projections is large relative to historical
    variability, while precipitation changes are less certain in sign but smaller
    in magnitude relative to historical variability.
  5: "Temperature terms generally contribute most of the total uncertainty, but precipitation\
    \ uncertainties become most important for high values of E[\u03B2P] coupled with\
    \ low values of E[\u03B2T] and Var(\u03B2T) and high values of Var(/Delta1P)."
  7: Uncertainties in crop temperature responses represent a greater source of uncertainty
    for future impacts than changes in precipitation; representing uncertainty by
    examining output from different climate models risks overestimating the ability
    to predict agricultural responses to climate change.
Methodology:
  1: Evaluated uncertainties for climate change impacts on crop production across
    94 crop-region combinations focusing on climate model projections of temperature
    and precipitation, and crop sensitivities to these changes.
  2: Uses statistical models with linear regression analysis and GCM forecasts to
    evaluate uncertainty in crop production changes by 2030.
  3: Analysis based on the predicted response of crop production to changes in growing
    season temperature and precipitation, using data from 20 GCMs for projections
    until 2030.
  5: "Histogram of estimates for each variable in equation (2) from 94 crop\u2013\
    region combinations; Sensitivity analysis of the fraction of total variance in\
    \ equation (2) contributed by the first three terms relating to temperature."
  7: Analysis based on time series models, not process-based models or cross-sectional
    data; considers uncertainties related to growing season average temperature and
    precipitation.
More Notes:
  1: The sensitivity of crop yields to temperature is identified as a critical source
    of uncertainty despite rainfall's known importance to crop yield variability.
  5: "The relative importance of climate change impacts rests largely on impacts of\
    \ rainfall changes; Results indicated that the relative importance of terms involving\
    \ temperature was most sensitive to the value of E[\u03B2P]."
  7: Adaptive management changes represent a poorly known source of uncertainty; crop
    model inter-comparison projects may be useful in the short-run; warming trials
    for major crops may be a useful means of prioritizing and focusing adaptation
    efforts.

    yields and the uncertainty surrounding these factors. It does not directly address
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes or the costs and benefits of adaptation

Quantitative material:
  3: Figure 1(c) shows the mean and standard deviation of projections for growing
    season average temperature (red) and precipitation (blue) changes by 2030, based
    on output from 20 GCMs and expressed as a multiple of the standard deviation of
    historical temperature or precipitation.
