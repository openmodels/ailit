Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate model projections of future temperature and precipitation, and the sensitivities
    of crops to temperature and precipitation changes.
  2: Growing season average temperature and precipitation.
  3: Changes in growing season average temperature and precipitation impact crop production.
  4: Precipitation and temperature changes.
  5: Changes in temperature and rainfall are identified as key drivers of climate
    impact risks on crops.
  6: Temperature and rainfall changes are the primary drivers of risk to crop production
    considered on this page.
  7: Average growing season temperature and precipitation changes.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Climate change impacts on crop production, specifically focusing on 94 crop-region
    combinations that account for the bulk of calories consumed by malnourished populations.
  2: The change in crop production due to changes in growing season average temperature
    and precipitation.
  3: The page provides an overview of the predicted response of crop production to
    changes in growing season average temperature and precipitation.
  4: Crop production sensitivity to precipitation and temperature.
  5: The page evaluates the relative importance of temperature and precipitation changes
    on climate impacts affecting U.S. crops.
  6: The paper evaluates the uncertainty in crop production impacts due to climate
    change, specifically focusing on temperature and rainfall sensitivity.
  7: Agricultural responses to climate change, specifically crop yields.
Highlights:
  1: Temperature sensitivity of crop yields is a critical source of uncertainty in
    climate change impact projections for agriculture.
  2: Uncertainty in the response of crop production to temperature is a significant
    source of overall uncertainty in crop production projections. Rainfall plays a
    critical role in year-to-year variability of production.
  3: Temperature changes have a larger impact on crop production than precipitation
    changes, with temperature uncertainty also being larger than precipitation uncertainty.
  4: Models with higher R^2 are more sensitive to precipitation. Uncertainty in future
    impacts for many models with high R^2 were still dominated by temperature.
  5: Temperature changes contribute significantly to the total variance in climate
    impact, but precipitation uncertainties become more important when crops are sensitive
    to rainfall and rainfall changes are uncertain.
  6: Reducing uncertainty in temperature sensitivity of crops could substantially
    improve the ability to predict agricultural responses to climate change.
  7: Uncertainties in average growing season temperature changes and crop responses
    to these changes represent a greater source of uncertainty for future impacts
    than do associated changes in precipitation, though this may not be true for all
    crops or spatial scales.
Methodology:
  1: The study evaluated uncertainties for projections of climate change impacts on
    crop production by focusing on the relative contributions of climate model projections
    of temperature and precipitation, and the sensitivities of crops to these factors.
  2: The paper uses a simple approximation (equation 1) for the change in crop production
    based on changes in growing season average temperature and precipitation. Multiple
    linear regressions are performed using first-differenced crop production, temperature,
    and precipitation data from 1961-2002 to compute the sensitivity of crop production
    to temperature and precipitation. Uncertainty is quantified using equation 2,
    assuming independence between temperature and precipitation changes.
  3: The analysis utilizes projections from 20 global climate models (GCMs) to evaluate
    changes in temperature and precipitation by 2030 as multiples of historical standard
    deviations.
  4: Statistical crop models were used across 94 crop-region combinations. The relationship
    between the model's R^2 and the sensitivity of crop production to precipitation
    and the fraction of variance attributed to temperature were analyzed. Models were
    tested with monthly precipitation and temperature-rainfall interaction terms.
  5: The page discusses a sensitivity analysis evaluating the contribution of temperature
    and rainfall terms to variance in climate impacts on U.S. crop regions.
  6: "Sensitivity analysis was performed by inflating the estimates of E[\u03B2P]\
    \ (sensitivity of crops to rainfall) by a factor of two and five, and regenerating\
    \ results from figure 1(b)."
  7: Time series models are used to analyze the impacts of temperature and precipitation
    on crop yields, rather than process-based models or cross-sectional data.
More Notes:
  1: The paper argues that understanding crop responses to temperature and the magnitude
    of regional temperature changes are two of the most important needs for climate
    change impact assessments and adaptation efforts for agriculture.
  2: The R2 values of the statistical models provide insights into the accuracy of
    the linear model and potential limitations, varying across crops and regions.
  3: Even in predominantly rainfed systems like maize and sorghum, temperature dominates
    as a factor influencing crop production.
  7: The study acknowledges limitations, including the exclusion of extreme events,
    pests and diseases, changes in solar radiation, adaptive management changes, and
    the distribution of rainfall within growing seasons.
Quantitative material:
  1: Uncertainties related to temperature represented a greater contribution to climate
    change impact uncertainty than those related to precipitation for most crops and
    regions.
  2: The paper uses 20 different general circulation models (GCMs) under three emissions
    scenarios (SRES B1, A1b, and A2) to project climate change impacts by 2030 for
    94 crop-region combinations. It finds that a one standard deviation change in
    growing season precipitation is associated with as much as a 10% change in production
    for South Asia millets. R2 values for the linear regression models varied from
    near zero to 0.67.
  3: The page provides quantitative information on the predicted response of crop
    production to changes equivalent to one standard deviation of historical variability.
  4: Models with higher R^2 tend to have greater sensitivity to precipitation (expressed
    as % change in production for each % change in precipitation), and a more important
    contribution from rainfall to uncertainty in future impacts.
  5: "The page includes quantitative assessments, such as percentages per changes\
    \ in temperature (\u03B2T) and rainfall (\u03B2P), but specific values are not\
    \ visible due to the image issue."
  6: Constraining temperature sensitivities of all crops to the level of precision
    in South Asia wheat would result in a reduction of total variance of impact projections
    by over half in most cases.
  7: "Fraction of total variance in climate change impact projections for 2030 remaining\
    \ if the estimated value of \u03C3(\u03B2T) is replaced by the lowest observed\
    \ value across all crops (0.7% per \u25E6C)."
