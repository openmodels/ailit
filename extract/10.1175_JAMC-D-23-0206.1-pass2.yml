Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in extreme daily precipitation events due to anthropogenic climate change
  2: Extreme daily precipitation.
  3: Daily precipitation amounts; Extreme precipitation; extreme value theory (EVT)
    characterizes the frequency and intensity of extremes
  4: Extreme precipitation events are the drivers of risk being investigated in this
    work, specifically the maximum 24-h precipitation value for each hydrologic year.
  5: "Annual and seasonal (December\u2013February, March\u2013May, June\u2013August,\
    \ September\u2013November) daily precipitation"

    impacting regional hydroclimate stability and water scarcity.
  7: Extreme precipitation, potentially underestimated tropical cyclone precipitation
  8: Increased precipitation in the Northeast, Midwest, and Southeast CONUS, potentially
    exacerbated by anthropogenic climate change.

    is similar to Fig. 2 but for June-August, and the mention of historical (HIST)
    vs. projected scenarios (EOC4.5, EOC8.5) for this period.

  21: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: Increasing variability in precipitation extremes for eight climatologically unique
    cities across the CONUS by the end of the twenty-first century and significant
    increases in return period precipitation amounts for most cities examined.
  3: Extreme precipitation changes over relatively short intervals are particularly
    important due to their potential societal impacts; Annual extreme events can be
    used to determine the probability of 100-yr return period precipitation values,
    which can then inform infrastructure design and mitigation efforts.
  4: HIST daily mean and extreme precipitation are compared favorably to PRISM, despite
    a few regional and seasonal biases.
  5: HIST admirably represented the mean and 99th percentile of daily precipitation
    annually and seasonally compared to PRISM; the HIST annual 99th percentile of
    daily precipitation was significantly wetter for a large area of the Intermountain
    West.
  6: Projected increases in the 99th percentile of daily precipitation in the Cascade
    Mountains and Ohio River Valley, and decreases in the Southwest and southern Great
    Plains. Decreases in the 99th percentile of daily precipitation are projected
    for the Southwest and Intermountain West under the EOC8.5 scenario.
  7: "EOC8.5 seasonal mean precipitation in the Midwest and Ohio Valley had statistically\
    \ significant increases in March\u2013May."
  8: "Most robust statistically significant increases in mean MCS precipitation are\
    \ in the Northeast into the Appalachian Mountains (June\u2013August), Ohio Valley\
    \ (December\u2013May), and Midwest (March\u2013May and September\u2013November)."
  9: The model tends to underestimate the highest extreme values, particularly when
    the difference between the largest extreme values is high. The estimation bias
    is larger for higher magnitude values, partly attributed to small input data amounts.
  10: Underestimation of high precipitation values is a recurring bias in the model.
    Reasonable model estimation exists for lower magnitude values. High correlation
    exists in the distribution patterns of the modeled EVA.
  11: No relevant information
  12: Most cities show an increase in return period daily precipitation values for
    25-500 years in one or both EOC scenarios. The Intermountain West, Midwest, Southeast,
    and Northeast all show increases in the 100-yr return period daily precipitation
    values in the EOC scenarios.
  14: Provides return periods of daily precipitation for historical and future climate
    scenarios, showing how precipitation extremes might change.
  15: There had statistically significant increases in EOC8.5 for areas of the Intermountain
    West, Southwest, and Northeast while EOC4.5 displayed only sporadic areas of significant
    increases.
  16: Results projected increasing values of extreme daily precipitation through the
    end of the twenty-first century for both RCP scenarios in many regions in the
    CONUS, such as the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, and Pacific Northwest.
  17: Sporadic increases in the Intermountain West in both EOC scenarios for December-February.
    Robust decreases of 100%-150% in the Intermountain West for March-May under EOC8.5.
    Sporadic decreases in the Southwest, northern Great Plains, and Southeast for
    June-August in EOC8.5. Increases of >100% in the central Midwest in September-November
    in EOC8.5.

Methodology:
  1: "Dynamically downscaled, convection-permitting regional climate model to investigate\
    \ extreme daily precipitation in the CONUS. Historical baseline (1990\u20132005)\
    \ and two epochs at the end of the twenty-first century (2085\u20132100) under\
    \ intermediate and pessimistic emissions scenarios are compared."
  2: Uses dynamically downscaled convection-permitting simulation (WRF-ARW version
    4.1.2 with 3.75 km horizontal grid spacing) forced by bias-corrected CESM GCM
    output to simulate precipitation during 1990-2005 (HIST) and 2085-2100 (EOC) epochs.
  3: "Daily precipitation amounts are derived from the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA)\
    \ total simulation precipitation accumulation variable; compares HIST daily extreme\
    \ precipitation to observations using the Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent\
    \ Slopes Model (PRISM); Implements univariate EVA using the Fisher\u2013Tippett\u2013\
    Gnedenko theorem with the daily precipitation time series for the PRISM, HIST,\
    \ EOC4.5, and EOC8.5 epochs; uses both block maxima (BM) and peak over threshold\
    \ (POT) methods in EVA"
  4: Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) is used to model extreme precipitation. The Block
    Maxima (BM) technique is used with a block size of 1 year. Extracted extremes
    are fitted to a right-skewed Gumbel distribution, selected based on AIC and log-likelihood
    metrics. A 1000-iteration bootstrap sample is used to calculate the 95% confidence
    interval of the 2-500-yr return periods. Statistical significance is determined
    when the median EOC epoch return period precipitation value is outside the 95%
    confidence interval from the 1000-iteration bootstrap sample for the HIST.
  5: "Comparison of the 99th percentile of daily precipitation from the HIST data\
    \ set and the PRISM data set for 1990-2005, assessing differences annually and\
    \ seasonally. A Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to determine statistically significant\
    \ differences (p < 0.05) between the epochs with a field significance false discovery\
    \ rate of a 5 0.1."
  6: "Compared HIST (historical) climate data to potential future climate scenarios\
    \ (EOC; 2085\u20132100) using RCP4.5 (EOC4.5) and RCP8.5 to assess future changes\
    \ in extreme precipitation.  Seasonal analysis of the 99th percentile of daily\
    \ precipitation was implemented to identify spatio-temporal changes through the\
    \ end of the twenty-first century."
  7: Uses HIST, EOC4.5, and EOC8.5 simulations. Employs a Mann-Whitney U test with
    a field significance false discovery rate of a = 0.1 to determine statistically
    significant differences (p < 0.05) between epochs.
  8: Analysis compares historical precipitation data (HIST) with mid-century (EOC4.5)
    and high-end (EOC8.5) climate scenarios for March-May (MAM).
  9: Extreme value analysis (EVA) is used to model distributions. Q-Q plots assess
    the fit of the WRF time series and modeled EVA distributions. Historical climate
    data (HIST) is compared to projected climate scenarios EOC4.5 and EOC8.5. The
    analysis covers eight cities (reference to Figure 6). The estimation bias may
    be partly due to the small amount of input data (15 values).
  10: The analysis involves comparing modeled extreme value analysis (EVA) with input
    WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting model) distributions and uses metrics such
    as r, p, RMSE, and R2 to evaluate the empirical relationship between the modeled
    EVA and input WRF distributions. Q-Q plots are used for visual representation.
  11: Q-Q plot of input WRF vs modeled EVA daily precipitation for 1990-2005 PRISM
    and HIST and 2085-2100 EOC4.5 and EOC8.5 epochs with a block size of 1 year resulting
    in 15 values for eight climatologically unique cities.
  12: Uses Probability Density Functions (PDFs) to assess variability in extreme daily
    precipitation values. Evaluates model performance using metrics like r, p, RMSE,
    and R2 for PRISM, HIST, EOC4.5, and EOC8.5 epochs (1990-2005 for PRISM & HIST,
    2085-2100 for EOC4.5 & EOC8.5).
  14: Analysis uses modeled return periods for eight climatologically unique cities.
    A 1000-iteration bootstrap sample is used to calculate 95% confidence intervals.
  15: "Investigated how extreme daily precipitation de\uFB01ned as the 99th percentile\
    \ value in a 24-h period may change by analyzing return periods (5\u2013500 years)\
    \ of daily precipitation (mm) for 1990\u20132005 (PRISM and HIST) and 2085\u2013\
    2100 (EOC4.5 and EOC8.5) for eight climatologically unique cities. The gradient\
    \ represents the median of a 1000-iteration bootstrap for each city and the brackets\
    \ contain the mean and 95% con\uFB01 dence interval."
  16: "Uses a novel convection-permitting dynamically downscaled RCM dataset with\
    \ two end-of-century (2085\u20132100) epochs under pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5."
  17: The analysis considers two emission scenarios (EOC4.5 and EOC8.5) and examines
    changes in the 99th percentile of daily precipitation across different seasons
    (December-February, March-May, June-August, and September-November). It looks
    at biases and statistically significant changes.

  4: The spatial plots of the 100-yr return periods of daily precipitation values
    were spatially aggregated to 30 km from the native 3.75-km horizontal grid spacing
    using both a spatial mean and a spatial maximum to account for spatial uncertainty.
  5: "The statistically significant wet bias in HIST compared to PRISM in regions\
    \ of the Intermountain West during September\u2013February and in the northern\
    \ Great Plains and Midwest during December\u2013February coincided with less than\
    \ 10-mm raw differences but made for large percent (e.g., 150%) differences due\
    \ to relatively small denominators."
  6: "The statistically significant HIST dry bias in the western CONUS for June\u2013\
    August may be related to the North American monsoon season. Decreases in the Southeast\
    \ and Atlantic coast during September-November under future climate scenarios\
    \ may be due to decreased tropical cyclone frequency and related precipitation."
  7: HIST showed a statistically significant dry bias for some regions.
  8: "The 99th percentile of daily precipitation displayed large areas of greater\
    \ than 50% increase by the end of the twenty-first century in all seasons except\
    \ June\u2013August."
  9: The paper mentions a dataset, but does not describe what it consists of other
    than it is derived from WRF output. The projected climate scenarios (EOC4.5 and
    EOC8.5) are compared to historical data to assess the impact of future climate
    change. The maps provide a spatial visualization of the changes across the United
    States, but the description of the maps do not clarify what is being measured
    or if all areas are at the same temporal resolution.

  11: The analysis compares WRF model input to modeled EVA outputs, focusing on extreme
    precipitation values.  It presents a 1:1 trend line for comparison and uses data
    from PRISM and HIST historical datasets, as well as future climate scenarios EOC4.5
    and EOC8.5.
  14: Figure focuses on precipitation extremes rather than a direct impact like mortality
    or productivity.
  15: "Increases in return period precipitation values have signi\uFB01 cant implications\
    \ for infrastructure, especially considering structures currently under construction\
    \ that assume historical values."
  16: "The study compares the simulated HIST epoch (1990\u20132005) of extreme daily\
    \ precipitation to an independent dataset of observations (PRISM)."
  17: The study mentions changes in lower probability events (e.g., 100-yr return
    period) and their socioeconomic implications, particularly concerning NFIP and
    Special Flood Hazard Areas. The analysis also suggests that changes in vulnerability
    are likely to occur, given increases in precipitation values for return periods
    greater than 25 years in most cities examined (except Seattle) under both EOC
    scenarios. Future work could focus on subdaily accumulation for precipitation
    extremes, larger ensemble approach by using further emissions scenarios, GCM members,
    and time slices would help discern uncertainty of potential future changes in
    extreme precipitation.
