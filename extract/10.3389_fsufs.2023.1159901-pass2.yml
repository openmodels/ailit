Drivers of Risk:
  1: Future projections imply that droughts would last longer, become more intense,
    and increase in frequency in southern Africa, specifically affecting food production,
    particularly maize.
  2: Future droughts in southern Africa
  3: "Drought reduces available food supply and drives up food prices, erodes consumers\u2019\
    \ income (especially for smallholder farmers)."
  6: Droughts.
  8: Drought events (frequency, duration, and intensity affecting crop yields and
    regional maize production).
  9: The study primarily focuses on population and income changes as drivers affecting
    food security, production, and consumption patterns. It also considers the impact
    of moderate economic growth and the absence of drought as baseline conditions.
  10: Recurrent droughts in Southern Africa.
  11: Recurrent droughts introduce volatility in maize trade and reduce regional maize
    consumption.
  12: Projected drought events across southern Africa between 2025 and 2040, and the
    resulting drought price effects.
  13: Regional consecutive droughts.
  14: Drought
  15: Drought.
  16: Droughts, dependence on drought-sensitive crops like maize.
  17: Droughts
  18: Regional two-year droughts
  19: Two-year droughts
  21: Droughts, specifically consecutive two-year regional droughts
Highlights:
  1: Consecutive two-year regional droughts could lead to an increase of at least
    10% in the number of people at risk of hunger within a single year in southern
    Africa.
  2: Southern Africa is more vulnerable to physical drought for maize. However, societal
    factors including national drought policy responses significantly influence maize
    vulnerability to drought across sub-Saharan Africa.
  3: Drought reduces maize production, impacting food prices and food security differently
    across Southern African countries.
  6: Droughts significantly impact crop production and yield across Southern African
    countries, with varying effects on different crops and countries. Food price indices
    and the proportion of the food insecure population are also affected by droughts.
  8: Drought events are projected to cause food price increases and increase the number
    of people at risk of hunger. The study assumes drought affects tobacco production
    in Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Zambia because tobacco dominates 'other crops' in the
    IMPACT model for these countries.
  9: Under a 'no drought' scenario with moderate economic growth, southern Africa
    is projected to experience significant changes in food consumption patterns, with
    increased consumption of stimulants, meat, fruits, and pulses. The region is expected
    to become more import-dependent for cereals, roots & tubers, vegetable oils, and
    meat by 2040 due to slower growth in food production compared to demand.
  10: Droughts significantly impact maize production, leading to food price hikes;
    some crops like cowpea and soybean may experience increased production under drought
    due to substitution effects; local price delinking from world markets can influence
    the impacts.
  11: Droughts reduce regional maize consumption, increase maize imports (especially
    when South Africa is affected by drought), and worsen food insecurity.
  12: Significant regional maize production decreases lead to large increases in food
    insecurity; regional price increases for maize, and specific nations like Mozambique
    and Zimbabwe have the highest increases in the at-risk population.
  13: Zimbabwe, followed by Mozambique, Malawi, South Africa, Madagascar, and Zambia
    would experience substantial increases in the number of people at risk
  14: Production changes due to drought are similar between reported and simulated
    results for all countries and across all crops; Malawi farmers reallocate maize
    acreage to other crops in a drought year, sometimes leading to increased production
    of other crops, which is not observed in Zambia due to different land tenure systems.
  15: Drought reduces agricultural production and net maize exports compared to base
    scenarios; the IMPACT model simulates potential crop shifts at the national level
    in response to drought.
  16: Droughts significantly reduce crop production, particularly maize, jeopardizing
    food security in Southern Africa. The number of people at risk of hunger increases
    substantially with consecutive drought years.
  17: Provides projected impacts of droughts on food security in Southern Africa,
    showing the number and share of people at risk of hunger in various countries
    from 2024 to 2041.
  18: Drought scenarios project lower and more variable agricultural production compared
    to base scenarios across ten crops in southern Africa from 2020 to 2040.
  19: The projected impact of two-year droughts on food security varies across southern
    African countries from 2024 to 2041, with the analysis projecting both the number
    of people and the share of the population at risk of hunger.
  21: Future droughts would lead to more erratic agricultural production, worsening
    regional food security. Maize production is particularly vulnerable. Consecutive
    two-year droughts could drastically reduce maize production and increase the number
    of people at risk of hunger.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis uses bio-economic modeling to simulate the impact of future droughts
    on food security in southern Africa, using an adjusted version of the International
    Model for the Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT),
    version 3.2.
  2: Simulation of the impact of future droughts on food security in southern Africa;
    Identification of plausible pathways for enhancing regional food security under
    drought
  3: A process-based structural framework which combines crop, climate, hydrology,
    and economic models to project production, consumption, and food security under
    drought scenarios.
  6: Computations from authors using data on production and harvested area from FAOSTAT
    (2018) to estimate yield/acreage penalty as % change in yield/acreage in drought
    years relative to non-drought years. Computations from authors using data on food
    price indices and consumer price indices from FAOSTAT (2018) to compute food price
    change.
  8: Uses the IMPACT model, which is a partial equilibrium model that simulates the
    effects of drought on national food prices and food security. Drought frequency
    between 2000 and 2016 is used to project future drought occurrences between 2020
    and 2035.
  9: The study uses a model to project food production, consumption, and trade in
    Southern Africa under a 'no drought' scenario, considering population and income
    growth. The baseline results are applicable to the period between 2010 and 2040.
  10: Modeling of agricultural production under drought scenarios, comparing outcomes
    to a 'no drought' baseline; focuses on the period between 2010 and 2040.

    acreage reallocation in response to drought.
  16: Uses the IMPACT 3.2 model to simulate the impact of drought on crop production
    and food security. Model is calibrated by comparing net import shares with FAOSTAT
    data.

    in southern Africa; IMPACT model (code found in Robinson et al. (2015))
More Notes:
  1: The study recommends measures like breeding stress-resilient maize, promoting
    crop and diet diversification, and investing in rainwater harvesting to enhance
    food security under drought conditions.
  2: The study aims to quantify the bio-economic impact of future droughts in southern
    Africa to support disaster policies.
  3: Malawian farmers are known to replace maize with groundnut when faced with drought
    (Okori, 2018). The two-year droughts of 2014/15 and 2015/16 cropping seasons are
    used to analyze the impact of drought on food prices in southern Africa.
  6: Drought years and non-drought years vary by country based on the data.
  8: The IMPACT model doesn't capture indirect effects of droughts on the industrial
    and service sectors. The observed price effects reflect both the impact of droughts
    and policy measures deployed for disaster management, potentially underestimating
    the impact of droughts.
  9: The study highlights the importance of non-climate drivers (population and income)
    in influencing food security, serving as a baseline to assess the impact of droughts
    in Southern Africa.
  10: The analysis considers both traded and non-traded agricultural commodities and
    their differential responses to drought; acreage allocation shifts to more profitable
    drought-resistant crops during droughts.
  11: "The analysis projects changes in consumption patterns in southern Africa under\
    \ a \u2018no drought\u2019 scenario - 2040 versus 2010."
  13: "Figure 4 shows projected production and consumption changes in southern Africa\
    \ under the \u2018no drought\u2019 scenario - 2040 versus 2010. The figure analyzes\
    \ changes in consumption vs production, net exports in consumption, maize and\
    \ cassava productivity, meat productivity, and oilseeds productivity."
  14: IMPACT model assumptions may not fully reflect the socio-economic environment
    affecting crop production under drought, leading to discrepancies between simulated
    and reported values.
  15: The model assumes farmers can reallocate crop acreage and adjust input allocation
    (labor, fertilizer, supplemental irrigation) when faced with a drought.
  16: The simulated results on food insecurity are considered a lower limit, as they
    don't fully capture the impact of drought on rural incomes and purchasing power.
  17: The study focuses on drought impacts specifically, not on a comprehensive set
    of climate change risks. The response and reconstruction times are recommendations
    sourced from the World Bank and not an outcome of the study.
  19: The analysis suggests diversification away from maize to drought-tolerant crops
    to mitigate food security risks in certain countries.
  21: The study focuses on Southern Africa.
