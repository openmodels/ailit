Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change scenarios (HadCM3 model under SRES A1FI, A2, B1, and B2); Socio-economic
    scenarios (SRES); CO2 levels; Population dynamics; Economic and political structures.
  5: Climate change altering regional agricultural productivity, global food prices.
  6: Climate change (specifically, changes as modeled under the HadCM3 SRES A1FI and
    A2a scenarios) affecting agricultural yields.
  8: Climate change, represented by the HadCM3 SRES B1a and B2a scenarios, with and
    without CO2 effects.
  10: Different SRES emissions scenarios (A1, A2, B1, B2) impacting global crop yields.
  11: Changes in temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations due
    to various SRES scenarios (A1FI, A2, B1, B2).
  12: Climate change scenarios (A1, A2, B1, B2) impacting temperature and precipitation,
    CO2 fertilization effects, population growth, economic development, and agricultural
    technology.
  13: Anthropogenic climate change (temperature increases), different SRES scenarios
    (A1FI, A2a, A2b, A2c, B1a, B2a, B2b), CO2 effects (fertilization), economic and
    population growth rates, income levels.
  14: Climate change effects on crop yields, specifically CO2 effects and climate
    change scenarios (A1, A2, B1, B2) impacting agricultural production and global
    food security.
Highlights:
  1: The world appears able to continue to feed itself under the SRES scenarios during
    the rest of this century, but this is achieved through production in developed
    countries compensating for declines in developing nations, leading to increased
    regional differences in crop production and a significant polarisation of effects,
    with substantial increases in prices and risk of hunger among the poorer nations,
    especially under scenarios of greater inequality (A1FI and A2).
  6: The trend suggests declining agricultural yields globally over time, with Africa,
    South America, and parts of Asia experiencing more severe impacts (substantial
    decreases in yield of -30% or more). The impact of CO2 effects are considered.
  8: Many equatorial and temperate regions show significant cereal yield decreases
    by the 2080s under both climate change scenarios, while some higher latitude regions
    show potential increases.
  10: Small changes in cereal yield are evident in all scenarios by the 2020s, but
    these fluctuations are within historical variations.
  11: Developing countries are projected to experience crop yield decreases, especially
    in Africa and parts of Asia, while developed countries may see yield increases
    or smaller decreases, depending on the scenario. The A1FI scenario results in
    the greatest decreases, while the B1 scenario results in the smallest decreases.
    The CO2 fertilization effect can partially compensate for negative climate impacts
    in some regions.
  12: Climate change can lead to significant reductions in cereal production, especially
    without CO2 fertilization effects. Disparities in cereal yields between developed
    and developing countries are likely to increase. In the A2 world, the number of
    people at risk of hunger remains high due to inequality.
  13: Without the counteracting direct CO2 effects, crop production responds approximately
    linearly to temperature increases across the suite of scenarios. The number at
    risk are very high under A2 partly because of higher temperature and reduced yields
    but primarily because there are many more poor people in the A2 world. Under both
    scenarios there is little sign of any effect until after 2020.
  14: Disparities in cereal yields are expected to increase significantly under scenarios
    A1 and A2, with a significant risk of hunger among poorer nations; the results
    highlight non-linearities in the food supply system due to CO2 fertilisation and
    climate change.
Limitations:
  5: The non-agriculture sector is poorly modelled in the BLS, leading to simplifications
    in the simulation of responses to climatic change.
Methodology:
  1: Uses transfer functions derived from crop model simulations with observed climate
    data and projected climate change scenarios to estimate impacts on crop yields.
    The Basic Linked System (BLS) model is used to evaluate consequent changes in
    global cereal production, cereal prices, and hunger risk. Applicable under SRES
    emissions scenarios.
  5: The Basic Linked System (BLS) world food trade model is used to simulate economic
    adjustments and their impact on national and regional production changes and price
    responses; Includes crop-switching and land reclamation as adaptations.
  6: The analysis uses the HadCM3 climate model under SRES A1FI and A2a scenarios
    to project changes in national cereal yields, and is applicable for the 2020s,
    2050s and 2080s, compared with 1990.
  8: The analysis uses the HadCM3 SRES B1a and B2a scenarios to model potential changes
    in cereal yields, with and without accounting for CO2 fertilization effects. Results
    are applicable to assessing the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity
    at a national level under these specific scenarios.
  10: BLS simulations using nationally averaged yield changes for wheat, rice, maize,
    and soybean estimates.
  11: Crop yield projections are modeled under different SRES climate change scenarios,
    considering temperature, precipitation, and CO2 fertilization effects. Analysis
    is based on results up to the 2080s.
  12: The BLS (Base Line Scenario) is used to estimate cereal production. The analysis
    is performed under different SRES scenarios (A1, A2, B1, B2) considering various
    factors like population growth, CO2 fertilization effects, agricultural technology
    advancements, and climate change impacts on temperature and precipitation. Results
    are applicable to the 2080s. The impact of climate change on global cereal production
    is determined as the reduction in million of metric tonnes from the reference
    case, the future without climate change.
  13: Comparison of cereal production and prices under different SRES scenarios with
    and without CO2 fertilization effects, relative to a reference scenario with no
    climate change. Risk of hunger is based on the number of people who can purchase
    sufficient cereals given their income and cereal prices.
  14: Analysis using SRES scenarios to simulate world crop yields and World Food Trade
    System model to demonstrate impacts on food security. Scenarios include different
    realizations of CO2 effects and climate change.
More Notes:
  1: The study highlights non-linearities in the world food supply system, both biophysical
    (CO2 levels) and socio-economic (population dynamics, economic and political structures).
  6: The color gradient on the maps provides a visual representation of the degree
    of change in agricultural yields, with dark brown indicating a significant decrease
    and dark green a significant increase. The study considers scenarios both with
    and without CO2 effects.
  8: The analysis considers the influence of CO2 effects on yield changes in addition
    to climate-related factors.
  10: The analysis considers the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations
    on crop yields, which helps to mitigate the negative impact of climate change.
    Regional variations within countries are not reflected.
  11: Multidecadal variability dominates the results in the 2020s. The impacts on
    cereal yields vary significantly depending on the climate change scenario and
    region.
  14: Emphasizes regional uncertainties in crop yield outcomes, sensitivity to CO2
    fertilization, and the importance of considering natural variability in climate
    model projections.

  6: Potential changes (%) in national cereal yields for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s
    compared to 1990, under specific climate scenarios (HadCM3 SRES A1FI and A2a),
    with and without CO2 effects. Examples include declines of up to -30% or more
    in some regions.
  8: Projected percentage changes in national cereal yields for the 2020s, 2050s,
    and 2080s, compared with 1990, under specific climate change scenarios.
  10: Figure 10 shows future reference case global cereal prices, relative to 1990
    prices, for the four SRES marker scenarios (no climate change). Figure 11 shows
    future reference case estimates of the numbers of people at risk of hunger, for
    the four SRES marker scenarios (no climate change).
  11: Under the A1FI scenario, cereal yields could fall by as much as 10% globally
    by the 2050s, and up to 20% in Africa by the 2080s without considering CO2 effects.
    Maize production in Africa could fall by as much as 30%. Under the B1 scenario,
    cereal yield decreases never exceed 10%.
  12: Cereal production increases to B3900, B4800, B3700 and B4100 million metric
    tons (mmt) by the 2080s under A1, A2, B1 and B2 SRES scenarios, respectively,
    without climate change.  Cereal price increases >160% in South America and Africa
    by the 2080s in the A2 world (compared to current day market prices). Cereal price
    increases of 30-70% by the 2050s under A1 and B1, followed by a decline. Reduction
    in cereal production due to climate change is about 5% for B1 and B2, and 10%
    for A1 and A2 by the 2080s (assuming no CO2 effects). The number of people at
    risk of hunger is largely unaltered in the A2 world, at around 800 million people.

    seven SRES scenarios with and without CO2 effects, relative to the reference scenario
    (no climate change), for 2020, 2050, and 2080. Figure 13 shows changes in global
    cereal prices (% change relative to 1990) under seven SRES scenarios with and
    without CO2 effects, relative to the reference scenario (no climate change), for
    2020, 2050, and 2080. Figure 14 shows the number of additional millions at risk
    of hunger due to climate change assuming no CO2 effects. World cereal production
    is estimated at 3900, 4800, 3700 and 4100 mmt in the 2080s under A1, A2, B1 and
    B2 SRES scenarios, respectively, assuming no effects of climate change on crop
    yields and current trends in economic and population growth rates.
