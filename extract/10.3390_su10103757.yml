Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, specifically temperature increases.
  2: Climate change impacts on crop yields and their subsequent socio-economic effects,
    including economic losses, influence cropland use decisions.
  9: Changes in temperature (GrsAvg), Precipitation, Irrigation Rate, Pesticide usage,
    Fertilizer usage, Farm Revenue, Planted Scale, and a Time trend.
Highlights:
  1: Temperature increases are projected to shift crop mixes, potentially impacting
    food security and requiring adaptation efforts.
  2: Climate change impacts have led to changes in cropland allocation and liberalization
    impacts on trade, with economic losses particularly in crops like corn and soybeans
    in China.
  5: The relationship between temperature and precipitation and the planted area shares
    of various crops (tubers, rice, wheat, maize, soybeans, oils, cotton, fibers,
    special crops, vegetables, and orchards) are examined.
  9: Temperature (GrsAvg) and Precipitation have statistically significant effects
    on crop yields. Irrigation Rate has a strong and statistically significant impact
    on Rice, Maize, and Wheat yields. Fertilizer usage and PlantedScale also have
    significant, often negative, effects on crop yields.
Methodology:
  1: Fractional multinomial logit (FMLOGIT) model used to examine the influence of
    climate on regional crop mixes in mainland China from 2001 to 2013, under historical
    and future climate conditions.
  2: The analysis includes estimating the economic losses due to climate impacts on
    crop yields and inferring alterations in crop land-use decisions based on past
    trends and liberalization efforts.
  5: The methodology is not explicitly stated on this page, but the table suggests
    a statistical analysis using explanatory variables to predict crop share proportions.
    The data covers the period 2000-2014, making the results applicable to that timeframe
    and potentially offering insights into similar agricultural contexts.
  9: Regression analysis with delta-method standard errors. Marginal effects are evaluated
    at the means of the variables. The model uses lagged values for IrrigRate, Pesticide,
    Fertilizer, FarmRev, and PlantedScale.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on crop mix land use and its relationship to climate, and identifies
    possible effects on regional food production and agricultural income, offering
    early warnings on required adaptation efforts.
  5: The pesticide data is sourced from a different set of statistical yearbooks than
    other variables. The pesticide variable is based on the raw commodity masses of
    the pesticide mix.
  9: The table only shows marginal effects and does not directly quantify the overall
    macroeconomic or fiscal impacts. The effects are crop-specific and may have different
    implications for countries depending on their agricultural composition.
No relevant information:
  15: This page primarily discusses future research directions and limitations of
    the original study, without presenting specific quantitative findings or conclusive
    results regarding macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, or concrete costs/benefits
    of adaptation at a national level.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Regional food security, agricultural income, and potential need for adaptation
    efforts to maintain food production.
  5: No relevant information
  9: Effects on the yields of various crops (Rice, Maize, Wheat, Soybean, Tubers,
    Oils, Cotton, Vegetables, Orchards, Special crops, Fibers) due to changes in GrsAvg
    (likely a measure of temperature), Precipitation, Irrigation Rate, Time trend,
    Pesticide usage, Fertilizer usage, Farm Revenue, and Planted Scale. Implied indirect
    impact on macroeconomic factors through agricultural productivity.
Quantitative material:
  1: Projected increases in wheat and tuber production, decreases in rice and maize
    production, increases in cash crops (vegetables, orchards) and fiber crops, decreases
    in oil-bearing and specialty crops, under future climate scenarios.
  2: "Climate change causes an economic loss in China\u2019s corn and soybeans sectors\
    \ amounting to $820 million cumulatively (in Year 2009 US dollars) during the\
    \ period of 2001\u20132009."
  5: The table provides summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max) for
    various explanatory variables (temperature, precipitation, planted area ratios,
    fertilizer usage, pesticide usage, gross farm revenue, time trend, average temperature
    across all years, and average total precipitation across years) and dependent
    variables (planted area shares for various crops).
  9: Table 3 provides marginal effects of the listed variables (GrsAvg, Precipitation,
    Irrigation Rate, Time trend, Pesticide usage, Fertilizer usage, Farm Revenue,
    Planted Scale, meanGrs, meanPrep) on the yields of various crops (Rice, Maize,
    Wheat, Soybean, Tubers, Oils, Cotton, Vegetables, Orchards, Special crops, Fibers),
    evaluated at the means of the variables. Statistical significance (p < 0.01, p
    < 0.05, p < 0.1) is indicated.
