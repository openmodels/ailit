Drivers of Risk:
  3: Urbanization, ageing population, migration processes, demographic imbalance between
    developed and developing nations, technological changes in the labor market (automation),
    falling demand for unqualified labor, transition to 'urbanist' consumption.
  4: Intensifying international conflict driven by new economic/technological centers
    and a crisis in international institutions. Growing migration leading to social,
    international, and interfaith conflicts. Global imbalances between debtor and
    creditor countries. Growing demand for environmentally friendly products. Intensifying
    specialization of regions globally, including identifying land for global environmental/resource
    reserves and, partly, the excessive environmental load in a number of developing
    countries. Deficit of vitally important resources like clean drinking water and
    fertile land. Rising prices for natural resources, especially hydrocarbons, uranium,
    and certain types of metal. Rapid obsolescence of existing technology and the
    increasing complexity of new solutions and platforms.
  5: Exhaustion of natural resources, deterioration of the environmental situation;
    development of targeted treatments based on genome mapping results.
  6: Environmental pollution impacting public demand for quality of life.
  7: Growth in production costs of oil and gas combined with stabilization of global
    hydrocarbon prices, Technological developments causing certain markets to 'close
    down', Environmental conditions deteriorating (Pacific Rim, Central Asia) leading
    to uncontrolled immigration
  8: New technologies (advanced 3D printing, new energy technologies, Internet of
    Things, etc.) can displace traditional industries and energy sources, and stricter
    environmental standards can close markets to traditional goods.
  9: Intensification of international conflicts making it more difficult for domestic
    companies to access key technological expertise; Low commodity prices; Growing
    cost and falling accessibility of technologies and funding; Increasing cost of
    basic resources and factors of production; Socio-economic imbalance and consolidation
    of the class structure.
  10: Growing capital expenditure and limited access to modern technologies amid the
    stabilization or even fall of global hydrocarbon prices; Negative demographic
    trends; Lack of specialists with a specific profile attributable to shrinking
    incomes of manufacturing companies; Reorientation of migration flows towards EU
    countries; Policy conducted by the Bank of Russia; Price uncertainty and reduced
    income in the global commodity markets; Change in traditional business models;
    Changes in technological and environmental standards
Highlights:
  3: Ageing populations can create shortcomings in pension and financial systems and
    the falling demand for unqualified labor globally is leading to guaranteed economic
    competitiveness through the continuous modernization of existing human capital.
  4: Intensifying international conflicts, global imbalances, environmental and climate
    problems, and technological developments pose risks to the global economy and
    national economies.
  5: Biomedicine is identified as a key and promising area of economic development.
  6: Russia faces demographic challenges similar to other industrially developed countries,
    influencing economic stability.
  7: Rising oil and gas extraction costs coupled with stable global prices pose a
    crisis risk for the Russian oil and gas industry due to financial resource shortages.
  8: New technologies and stricter environmental standards pose risks to the Russian
    economy by displacing traditional industries, especially hydrocarbons.
  9: Certain sectors of the Russian economy are already experiencing certain weaknesses.
  10: Several macroeconomic risks are identified for the Russian economy, including
    falling oil incomes, labor shortages, limited access to credit, technological
    backwardness, skills shortages, and market liquidation due to changing standards.
Methodology:
  3: Not explicitly stated, but it appears to involve analyzing trends related to
    demographic shifts, technological change, and consumption patterns.
  4: The paper discusses general trends and observations. By the early 2030s, the
    question of adapting to long-term and very long-term processes, including climate
    change, will be firmly rooted on the global political and technological agenda.
  5: Forecasts of a new mode of life form over the next 15 years right up to the 2030s.
  7: The demographic burden dynamics are based on Rosstat demographic forecast data,
    average variant, accessed 25.01.2015.
  8: Scenarios are used to project capital-output ratio and Urals crude oil prices.
  9: Industry analysis to outline current challenges to the development of certain
    sectors of the Russian economy.
  10: Forecasts are used.
More Notes:
  3: The paper mentions the development of technologies for the elderly, transitions
    to 'urbanist' consumption, and increased consumption of electricity alongside
    increased energy efficiency.
  4: The paper mentions Russia experiencing warming at a rate exceeding the global
    average but clarifies that, unlike the global trend, no slowing of warming has
    yet been detected on Russian territory.
  7: The paper suggests a potential macroeconomic risk associated with the oil and
    gas sector in Russia, driven by rising extraction costs and stable prices, which
    could lead to budgetary instability and balance of payments issues.
  8: The paper touches on reshoring (reverse transfer of production from developing
    to developed countries) due to technology, which could affect the competitive
    landscape for Russian companies.
  9: Focuses on the Russian context, specifically challenges facing the Russian S&T
    complex.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Shift in the balance between employed and those incapable of work may lead to
    a reduction in savings rates in developing countries. This wreaks havoc on the
    ability of economies to finance deficits in developed countries.
  4: Structural risks in relationships between developed debtor countries and developing
    creditor countries due to global imbalances.
  5: Increasing price volatility for natural resources as a result of simultaneous
    growth in the cost of extraction and tighter regulations regarding the efficiency
    of energy technologies used; increased migration flows, caused by exhaustion of
    natural resources/deterioration of the environmental situation; spread of conflicts
    over resources in developing countries.
  6: Increased social tension and state spending due to mass influx of migrants.
  7: Macroeconomic risks of losing budgetary stability and disruption of the balance
    of payments due to dependence on commodity exports.
  8: The development of new energy, energy saving technologies, batteries, and adaptive
    energy system management technologies are capable of removing domestic hydrocarbons
    from the market, which involve high production costs.
  9: Steady decline in the global situation leading to relatively low commodity prices
    and a negative impact on business income from the increasing cost of basic resources
    and factors of production.
  10: "Sharp fall in incomes in the oil industry; Intensified deficit in labor resources,\
    \ especially qualified labor; Reduced income in global commodity markets are forcing\
    \ players in the banking and financial sector to revise their risks upwards, which\
    \ means that corporate lending is more expensive; Backwardness of the technological\
    \ equipment at production facilities; Skills crisis as a result of a change in\
    \ traditional business models; Liquidation of markets due to changes in de facto\
    \ standards and the introduction of \u2018closing\u2019 technologies; Reduced\
    \ effectiveness of existing state support instruments for technological development"
Quantitative material:
