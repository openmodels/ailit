    specific to wildfire PM2.5.
  11: Mortality burden from exposure to PM2.5 due to wildland fire smoke is calculated.
  13: This paper evaluates health impacts, including mortality and morbidity, related
    to air pollution from wildfires.
Highlights:
  1: Wildfires have a greater mortality and economic burden than previously indicated.
  2: The study provides estimates of premature deaths due to wildland fires over an
    11-year period (2008-2018) in California, using a chronic dose-response coefficient
    for wildfire PM2.5.
  3: 2018 is highlighted as having the highest mortality impact due to wildfires;
    contrasts are made between wildfire-specific and general dose-response mortality
    estimates.
  4: Mortality impacts from wildland fire smoke are substantial.  The elevated number
    of fires in 2008, 2017, and 2018 led to large increases in mortality impacts.  Mortality
    impacts are more widespread throughout population centers such as Los Angeles
    County, the San Joaquin Valley, and the Bay Area.
  5: Approximately 19% of total premature deaths attributable to all sources of PM2.5
    in California during the 11-year period are from fire-only PM2.5.
  6: The study found that using a wildfire-specific dose-response value increases
    the magnitude of mortality estimates from PM2.5 exposure due to wildfires.
  7: The study provides a unique contribution by using longitudinal data and applying
    a wildfire-specific dose-response coefficient to estimate chronic mortality impacts
    attributable to wildfires.
  8: Wildfire PM2.5 elicits many of the same sub-acute biological processes as undifferentiated
    PM2.5, with some studies suggesting heightened toxicity in the lung. Studies that
    rely solely on acute estimates from undifferentiated PM2.5 may underestimate effects
    if wildfire PM2.5 exhibits heightened toxicity. Wildfire PM2.5 may have unique
    physical-chemical components that amplify its toxicity.
  9: Wildland fire PM2.5 caused over 50,000 premature deaths in California between
    2008 and 2018, resulting in over $400 billion in economic damages.
  10: Application of undifferentiated dose-response values may underestimate mortality
    impacts from wildfire-specific PM2.5.
  11: Mortality burden calculations consider the chronic undifferentiated PM2.5 dose-response
    value and the EPA's VSL.
  13: The study utilizes data from California to model air quality and assess health
    impacts, with links provided to relevant datasets.
Methodology:
  1: Using a Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system for PM2.5 estimates
    and a wildfire-specific dose-response coefficient for mortality, applied to ZIP
    code-level mortality data.
  2: The study uses modeled wildland fire-associated PM2.5 concentrations, California
    Department of Public Health (CDPH) mortality data, and a calculated chronic dose-response
    coefficient for wildfire PM2.5 exposures. The study period is 2008-2018.
  3: The analysis uses CMAQ model simulations to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations
    and applies wildfire-specific and general dose-response values to assess mortality
    impacts; excludes values falling outside the 99.9th percentile in a modified cap
    scenario.
  4: Mortality impacts estimated using wildfire-specific and undifferentiated chronic
    dose-response values for 2008 to 2018 in California.  Modeled PM2.5 concentrations
    are sometimes capped.
  5: The analysis uses modeled wildland fire PM2.5 estimates at a 12-km grid scale,
    applying a chronic dose-response value for wildfire-specific PM2.5 exposure and
    a CTM (CMAQ) capable of isolating wildfire-related fine particle concentrations.
  6: The analysis uses a more highly resolved health data approach, extends the temporal
    period to 11 years, and applies a chronic wildfire-specific dose-response value.
  7: The analysis uses 11 years of CMAQ model data to estimate wildfire PM2.5, employing
    a mod cap to address overprediction and two exposure scenarios to assess mortality
    impacts.
  8: Used a CTM for exposure assignment to separate annual wildfire PM2.5 concentrations
    from those generated by other sources. Modified existing estimates of long-term
    exposure to undifferentiated PM2.5 with adjustment for potentially different dose-response
    functions of wildfires compared to undifferentiated PM2.5. Included estimates
    of both the adjusted and unadjusted long-term mortality associated with fire-only
    PM2.5.
  9: "The analysis applies Chemical Transport Model (CTM) estimates of wildland fire\
    \ PM2.5 to estimate mortality outcomes using high-resolution health data over\
    \ an 11-year period. It uses a chronic dose-response value for wildfire-specific\
    \ PM2.5 exposure. The PM2.5 concentrations were modeled using the U.S. EPA\u2019\
    s CMAQ modeling system at a 12-km grid spatial resolution."
  10: Mortality burden is quantified at the ZIP code level using 11 years of CMAQ
    data (2008-2018) with a chronic dose-response value derived from pooling short-term
    dose-response values.
  11: Monte Carlo distribution is used to estimate dose-response values; mortality
    calculations use specific dose-response values; supplemental analyses evaluate
    different dose-response estimates.
  13: The study uses ensemble-based modeling and deep learning to estimate PM2.5 concentrations
    and assess health impacts.
More Notes:
  3: The study shows regional and temporal variations in PM2.5 concentrations, with
    higher impacts in more rural areas and during high-fire years.
  4: Choice of dose-response value significantly impacts mortality estimates.
  9: The study acknowledges the need for future research directly investigating the
    chronic mortality effects of wildfire PM2.5. The study adjusted for the higher
    dose-response observed from wildfire PM2.5 exposure versus undifferentiated PM2.5.
  13: The study was supported by the California Air Resources Board, NASA, DOE, and
    UCLA.
Quantitative material:

  2: Fire-only PM2.5 contributes between 6.9 and 49% of PM2.5 from all sources in
    California, depending on the year, during 2008-2018. Years with significant fires

    PM2.5.
  3: Estimated annual mortality impacts due to fire-only PM2.5 exposure range from
    1240 to 12,850 deaths in different years, with a total of ~55,710 deaths over
    the 11-year period using wildfire-specific dose-response values.
