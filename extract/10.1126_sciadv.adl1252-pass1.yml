  6: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  2: Increased wildfire exposure due to aridification intensifying with climate change.
  5: Wildland fire and related PM2.5 emissions in California are identified as significant
    contributors to premature mortality and economic burden.
  6: Exposure to PM2.5 during wildfires
Highlights:
  2: The importance of wildfire management will only grow in the coming decades as
    aridification intensifies with climate change.
  5: Significant economic valuation for premature deaths due to fire-only PM2.5 exposure
    in California, accounting for nearly 19% of total deaths attributable to all PM2.5
    sources in the state.
  6: Capping fire-only concentrations at the 99.9th percentile results in fewer fire-only
    PM2.5 attributed deaths, but the overall magnitude of impacts remains substantial.
Methodology:
  2: Uses modeled wildland fire-associated PM2.5 concentrations, high-resolution California
    Department of Public Health (CDPH) mortality data, and a calculated chronic dose-response
    coefficient for wildfire PM2.5 exposures and mortality to estimate premature deaths
    due to wildland fires over an 11-year period from 2008 to 2018.
  5: Modeled wildland fire PM2.5 estimates using a 12-km grid scale from the CMAQ
    model, with associated premature mortality calculated using a chronic dose-response
    value.
  6: A 'mod cap' scenario, where modeled values are capped, is used to account for
    uncertainties in the modeled PM2.5 estimates.

  2: Analysis focuses on California.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: No relevant information
  5: The economic valuation of premature deaths attributable to fire-related PM2.5
    in California is estimated at $432 billion to $456 billion over an 11-year period.
  6: Economic valuation of mortality impacts from wildland fires.
Quantitative material:
  2: ''
  5: The estimated range of premature deaths due to fire-only PM2.5 in California
    from 2008 to 2018 is between 52,480 and 55,710.
  6: The modeled values are in billion $ (2015 dollars, 3% discount rate, and 2015
    income year).
