Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climatic changes
  2: Ocean warming, deoxygenation, acidification, coastal flooding, droughts, rising
    seas, and extreme weather.
  5: Climate change (specifically warming oceans), human activities resulting in greenhouse
    gas (GHG) emissions.
  10: Climate change-related temperature increases and ocean acidification causing
    coral bleaching. Shifts in fish distributions due to changes in ocean temperature.
  14: Climate change and ocean acidification will likely reduce the distribution and
    species diversity of most coral reef ecosystems; coastal water temperatures and
    salinity, influenced by climate change, affect Vibrio abundance; environmental
    conditions directly influence the extent and distribution of harmful algal blooms
    (HABs); climate disruption impacts ocean health and public health risks.
Highlights:
  1: Climatic changes may significantly reduce the benefits or ecosystem services
    provided by U.S. ocean and coastal ecosystems.
  2: Indicators of climate impacts on ocean and coastal ecosystems are needed to help
    track changes, provide early warnings, reduce impacts, and increase resilience
    of these valuable systems and the many people, communities, and economies that
    depend on them.
  5: Climate change may require updating fishery management practices and initiating
    activities designed to mitigate and/or adapt to climate stressors. The goal of
    the NCIS is to provide an early warning of changes and how those changes might
    reverberate through the other system components.
  10: Fish stock distributions change, altering the composition of ocean ecosystem
    communities and impacting predator/prey dynamics and competitive interactions.
    Range shifts can represent species' disappearance at one end and introduction
    at the other.
  14: Marine mammals can serve as effective sentinels for ecosystem change and emerging
    diseases.
Methodology:
  2: The US National Climate Indicator System (NCIS) helps establish baselines for
    understanding how environmental conditions are changing in response to changing
    climate, assess risks and vulnerabilities, and to help inform resiliency and planning
    for climate impacts.
  5: The NCIS (National Climate Indicators System) aims to identify key points along
    the ecosystem services pathway impacted by climate change to provide early warning
    of changes and their system-wide effects, using representative indicators linked
    to climate change and measurable changes to services and benefits. The selection
    of indicators is based on alignment with a conceptual model and utility for tracking
    specific services.
  10: Using survey data, shifts can be measured as directional changes in range centroids.
    Life history attributes are used to classify the potential for fish distributions
    to shift due to climate change.
  14: The paper suggests integrating data from existing networks like the NOAA National
    Marine Mammal Stranding Network with other ocean observing systems to understand
    the impacts of climate disruption on ocean health.
More Notes:
  2: The oceans have absorbed 25% of anthropogenic carbon emissions and 84% of the
    heat since the Industrial Revolution.
  5: The NCIS team attempts to identify representative indicators that show changes
    to specific services and benefits, and the linkages between regulating, supporting,
    provisioning, and cultural services.
  10: Spatial distances between the new stock range and fishing communities affect
    the costs of fishing, social networks, and subculture cohesion. Indicators of
    fish distribution are important to fishery managers and those who depend on living
    marine resources.
  14: The paper identifies a need for more data collection, research, and monitoring
    of coral reef health, Vibrio abundance, HABs, and marine mammal morbidity and
    mortality to better understand and address the economic and public health implications
    of climate change.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Impact of climatic changes on ecosystem services (subsistence food provisioning,
    health benefits, shoreline protection, climate regulation, conservation of marine
    biodiversity, and preservation of cultural heritage).
  2: US ocean and coastal ecosystems generate ~US$370 billion of US gross domestic
    product, $617 billion in sales, and 2.6 million jobs each year; they also provide
    important non-market services including subsistence food provisioning, health
    benefits, shoreline protection, climate regulation, conservation of marine biodiversity,
    and preservation of cultural heritage.
  5: "Cultural livelihoods (e.g., native peoples\u2019 rituals, multi-generational\
    \ fishing traditions, and nature tourism) and economic livelihoods through ocean-related\
    \ jobs and activities."
  10: Impacts on provisioning services, cultural services, and related livelihoods
    due to climate change affecting fisheries and shorelines. Economic benefits through
    tourism and recreational and commercial fishing. Coastline protection from storm
    surges. Focal points for subsistence fishing.
  14: Healthy coral reef ecosystems support economically valuable tourism industries.
Quantitative material:
  1: The U.S. EEZ generates ~US 370 billion of U.S. gross domestic product, 617 billion
    in sales and 2.6 million jobs each year.
  2: US ocean and coastal ecosystems generate ~US$370 billion of US gross domestic
    product, $617 billion in sales, and 2.6 million jobs each year; the US exclusive
    economic zone (EEZ) encompasses approximately 3.4 million square nautical miles
    of ocean and a coastline of over 12,300 miles.
