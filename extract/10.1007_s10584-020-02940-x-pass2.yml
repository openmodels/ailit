Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climatic changes
  2: Changes such as ocean warming, deoxygenation, acidification, coastal flooding,
    droughts, rising seas, and extreme weather impact ocean and coastal ecosystems.
  4: Anthropogenic climate change, ocean circulation, temperature, carbon cycling,
    coastal protection, flood attenuation, pollution, over-exploitation, land-use
    changes.
  5: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions leading to a rise in ocean temperatures, causing
    poleward shifts in marine fish geographic range.
  6: Sea surface temperature (SST), arctic sea ice extent, ocean chlorophyll concentration,
    and sea level rise are identified as drivers of change.
  9: Increases in atmospheric CO2 are identified as the primary driver of long-term
    declines in aragonite saturation state.
  10: Changes in ocean temperature, climate change-related temperature increases,
    ocean acidification
  12: Sea level rise, climate change affecting fishery species (e.g., increasing sea
    surface temperature, ocean acidification), fishery species range shifts.
  13: Climate change is identified as a driver that can alter the abundance and distribution
    of living marine resources harvested in subsistence fisheries.
  15: The paper mentions changes in the depth of the ocean's mixed layer, absorption
    of carbon dioxide, ocean acidification, and bottom temperature as drivers of risk

    and coasts, and economic and cultural livelihoods through ocean-related jobs and
    activities.
  6: Identifies and recommends indicators of climate-related changes to the ocean
    and coast relevant to ecosystem services.

    impact various aspects of marine life and related industries such as tourism,
    commercial fisheries, and subsistence fishing.

    vulnerabilities, and preparedness in ocean and coastal systems.
  15: The paper discusses the need to develop and track indicators of climate change
    impacts in ocean and coastal ecosystems across a range of ecosystem services.
    It focuses on understanding, preparing for, and responding to these changes.

Highlights:
  2: The article highlights the role of the National Climate Indicator System in tracking
    climate-related processes and impacts on oceans and coasts.
  4: Identifies potential indicators with robust science-based connections to anthropogenic
    climate change and pre-existing time-series monitoring data to track ecological
    and societal changes, mitigate against some long-term changes, and adapt to others.
  5: Climate change may require updating fishery management practices and initiating
    activities to mitigate and/or adapt to climate stressors.
  6: 'Recommends several indicators for tracking large-scale changes to the marine
    environment and ecosystem services. Prioritizes four indicators: sea surface temperature
    (SST), arctic sea ice extent, ocean chlorophyll concentration, and sea level rise.'
  9: Ocean acidification can increase coral bioerosion, change phytoplankton community
    composition, reduce recruitment of calcifying organisms, alter development and
    neurobiology of some fish species, and reorganize ecosystems.
  10: As fish stock distributions change, the composition of ocean ecosystem communities
    also changes, thereby affecting predator/prey dynamics and competitive interactions.
    A range shift can represent a species' disappearance at one end of its range and
    introduction at the other end.
  12: Identifies vulnerable populations that may be less able to withstand and recover
    from climate change and socioeconomic impacts. Highlights the importance of coastal
    and ocean waters to cultural identity, food, employment, and recreation.
  13: The paper highlights the need for consistent funding for monitoring and assessment
    to track trends in climate change impacts. It identifies subsistence fisheries
    as a prime candidate for new indicators due to their links to climate impacts
    in ocean and coastal systems, and their importance for food security and cultural
    value.
  15: The paper identifies a conceptual framework and an initial suite of indicators
    to track impacts of climate change in US ocean and coastal ecosystems and emphasizes
    the need for increased commitment to long-term data collection, synthesis, and
    delivery. It also emphasizes the pressing need to improve the synthesis, delivery,
    and integration of indicator information into decision-making.
  16: No relevant information
  19: Impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms, increasing thermal stress
    for tropical coral reefs.
Methodology:
  2: Indicators were developed in collaboration with the U.S. National Climate Indicators
    System (NCIS) to track impacts on ocean and coastal ecosystems.
  4: A conceptual model is defined to connect climate processes, physical attributes
    of the ocean, living organisms, and people. The model is based on existing information
    and hypotheses.
  5: Identification of key points along the ecosystem services pathway impacted by
    climate change to provide early warnings. Identification of representative indicators
    showing changes to specific services and benefits, and linkages between regulating,
    supporting, provisioning, and cultural services. Criteria for indicator selection
    include representativeness of climate variable changes and their impacts, and
    strong support in peer-reviewed scientific literature.
  6: Indicators were selected based on criteria including scalability, relevance to
    existing efforts, and communication of climate impacts. Assessment based on existing
    literature.
  9: The evaluation uses laboratory experiments, modeling exercises, and limited field
    observations to determine species sensitivity to ocean acidification.
  10: Using survey data, shifts can be measured as directional changes in range centroids.
  12: Uses community social well-being indicators composed of indices created from
    NMFS landings data, NMFS recreational fishing effort data, and/or publicly available
    US Census data. Applicable to coastal communities.
  13: The paper suggests improving existing indicators by reducing data lags, improving
    spatial and temporal representation, and reducing costs of indicator production.
    It also recommends developing new indicators where data is lacking, especially
    focusing on linking climate changes and their impacts.

More Notes:
  1: Focuses on ocean and coastal indicators at the land-sea interface within the
    U.S. EEZ, which encompasses approximately 3.4 million square nautical miles of
    ocean and a coastline of over 12,300 miles.
  2: No relevant information
  5: The NCIS (National Climate Indicator System) aims to identify key points along
    the ecosystem services pathway that may be impacted by climate change and can
    provide an early warning of changes to come and, critically, how those changes
    might reverberate through the other system components.
  6: Some indicators needed further development before being considered operational.
  10: This paper mentions impacts on provisioning and cultural services and related
    livelihoods, including food from the ocean and cultural traditions related to
    fishing. The spatial distances between the new stock range and the fishing communities
    who target those species may change, affecting the costs of fishing, social networks,
    and subculture cohesion.
  12: Suggests the indicators provide building blocks for a system to track and assess
    the impacts of climate change on US ocean and coastal ecosystems.
  13: The current species distribution indicator is mentioned, and the paper suggests
    improving it by incorporating information on species shifting across governance
    boundaries.
  15: The paper highlights that only a small set of indicators are currently operational
    and ready for inclusion in the pilot National Climate Indicator System (NCIS),
    indicating a need for further indicator development. The paper also notes that
    information on climate impacts in ocean and coastal ecosystems lags behind other
    areas.

    Technical Team. The paper involves the development of indicators.
