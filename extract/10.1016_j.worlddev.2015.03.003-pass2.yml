  16: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Drought
  3: Drought, extreme weather events
  6: Drought increases the likelihood of illness, particularly affecting households
    with high agricultural dependency and limited income sources.
  7: External factors, such as poorly and unequally distributed rainfall, and internal
    factors, including ongoing deforestation, the cultivation of water-intensive crops,
    and increased unregulated industrial activity.
  16: Rainfall shortage (drought severity) varying between 55 and 993 mm.
  18: Drought severity, age, sex (Male/Female), and total consumption per capita.
  20: Drought severity, particularly in households more dependent on agriculture,
    impacts illness prevalence.
  21: Drought, agricultural dependency, asset position of households, availability
    of off-farm income sources.
  22: Drought severity (3-month average), ethnic fractionalization, ethnic minority
    status
  24: Drought severity, Illness in household
  25: Drought-related illness incidence
  26: Drought due to delayed rainfall, particularly affecting rural areas dependent
    on water-intensive crops.
  32: 'Drought incidence (measured in different ways: 3-month average drought severity,
    1-month drought severity, drought severity including excess rainfall, and number
    of drought months in a 3-month average).'
Highlights:
  3: Individuals affected by drought display a deterioration of health conditions
    and have significantly higher health expenditures; the effect prevails among households
    with a high degree of agricultural dependency and limited access to coping mechanisms;
    drought-related health shocks can cause non-negligible additional financial burden
    for many households vulnerable to poverty in rural Vietnam.
  6: Drought leads to deteriorated health conditions in rural households and significantly
    higher health expenditures, with a substantial financial burden.
  7: Droughts in Vietnam are increasing in severity and length, leading to increased
    economic costs, such as an estimated 0.2% of the country's GDP in 2005.
  18: Drought severity is significantly associated with increased incidence of serious
    illness. Age and sex also have statistically significant effects on health indicators.
  20: The impact of drought on illness is significant, especially in agriculturally
    dependent households.
  21: Drought negatively impacts household health, especially for those with lower
    asset holdings and limited access to off-farm income. Drought leads to an increase
    in rice prices.
  22: Formal (HCFP) and informal (social networks, ethnic composition) insurance mechanisms
    appear to play a role in mitigating the impact of drought on illness. The results
    suggest that the impact of drought on illness differs based on household access
    to the HCFP scheme, private health insurance, social networks, ethnic fractionalization,
    and ethnic minority status.
  24: 'Drought has a statistically significant effect on health expenditures. Different
    age groups are impacted differently by drought as can be seen from the coefficients
    associated to different age cohorts. The income levels also appear to moderate
    some impacts. '
  25: Drought-related illness has a major impact on the health component of household
    consumption.
  26: Drought leads to a deterioration of health conditions and significantly higher
    health expenditures in affected rural households; drought increases the likelihood
    of illness, particularly in the working-age population in households dependent
    on agriculture and livestock.
  32: Drought incidence is positively associated with illness incidence. The three-month
    average drought severity measure has the highest explanatory power (highest adjusted
    R-squared and lowest AIC) compared to other drought measures.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of the effect of drought on health outcomes and health expenditures
    in rural Vietnam.
  3: Uses local rainfall data to link drought incidence to health shocks and health-related
    expenditures from a multiple-wave panel of rural Vietnamese households; IV strategy
  6: 'The analysis uses a two-part empirical approach: linking variations in rainfall
    to health outcomes and using an Instrumental Variable approach to estimate health
    expenditure effects.'
  7: "This paper scrutinizes the relation between drought and health at the micro-level\
    \ by considering the distinct features of Vietnam\u2019s rural economy and how\
    \ various channels interlink drought and health. The results are applicable to\
    \ the rural economy of Vietnam."
  18: OLS regressions with household-level clustered standard errors, wave and province
    fixed effects. The analysis considers individuals across four survey waves.
  20: OLS regressions are used, with standard errors clustered at the household level,
    accounting for wave and province fixed effects.
  21: Household-level estimates of the reduced-form relation between subjective rice
    price valuations and drought using household survey data. Regression analysis
    to assess the impact of drought on illness incidence, considering asset index
    and off-farm income.
  22: OLS regressions with household-level clustered standard errors. Wave and Province
    fixed effects, and other control variables are included.
  24: Tobit and IV-Tobit regressions are used, along with wave and province fixed
    effects. Models include group and Income interactions.
  25: IV-Tobit estimation, instrumenting the share of ill household members by the
    severity of drought.
  26: Combines household panel data with local rainfall data to establish a link between
    rainfall, drought-related illness, and healthcare expenditures; employs an Instrumental
    Variable approach based on rainfall events to estimate self-reported health shocks.
  32: OLS regressions with wave fixed effects, province fixed effects, and other control
    variables. Standard errors are clustered on the household level. Different measures
    of drought are used as independent variables in separate regressions predicting
    illness incidence.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on rural Vietnam.
  3: The paper focuses on micro-level impacts (health and expenditures) rather than
    macro-level outcomes or national adaptation costs/benefits directly. However,
    the abstract suggests that these micro-level impacts can have non-negligible financial
    burdens for vulnerable households.
  7: The paper will present results with implications on health insurance and household
    finances in section 5.
  18: The analysis does not find a significant association between BMI levels or BMI
    drops and drought for individuals above the age of 15.
  21: The analysis relies on subjective rice price valuations reported by household
    heads, which are prone to measurement error but considered informative due to
    widespread rice production and consumption. Province fixed-effects are used to
    account for unobserved determinants of rice quality.
  24: Asterisks indicate statistical significance (* p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01).
    The dependent variable is 'Health expenditures'. The sample size varies across
    specifications (e.g., 7380, 3715, 3648). There are variables for Household size,
    Dependency ratio and Male Share. There are potentially group indicators related
    to budget.
  25: The analysis is performed on data from Vietnam.
  26: The study focuses on the immediate effects of drought on health outcomes and
    health-related expenditures in Vietnam; long-term impacts of drought (child mortality,
    reduced cognitive abilities, lower income trajectories) are acknowledged, but
    the paper primarily addresses the short-term, direct economic costs related to
    illness.
  32: The analysis uses data at the individual level and examines the relationship
    between drought and health outcomes. The paper tests the robustness of the relationship
    between drought and health outcomes by using alternative measures of drought.

Quantitative material:
  3: No relevant information
  7: "A single drought in 2005 caused an estimated 110 million USD in economic damage,\
    \ or roughly 0.2% of the country\u2019s GDP."
  18: Living in the most drought-affected district increases the probability of illness
    by about nine percentage points compared to the least drought-affected. A one
    standard deviation increase in drought severity (0.21) causes the propensity of
    illness to rise by two percentage points.
  20: Table 3 presents regression results showing coefficients linking drought severity
    with illness and economic variables.
  21: A change of one standard deviation in drought intensity is associated with an
    increase of 0.02 PPP USD in rice price, roughly 3 % of the mean price in the sample.
  22: Yes, the table presents regression coefficients and standard errors for the
    impact of drought and its interaction with insurance mechanisms on illness. For
    example, a 0.1 unit increase in drought severity is associated with a 0.08 to
    0.11 increase in illness depending on the model. The interaction between drought
    and ethnic fractionalization has a coefficient of 0.2472.
  24: The table contains coefficients and standard errors related to drought severity
    and illness on health expenditures. There are also estimates for different age
    cohorts (0-10 years, 11-20 years, etc.).
  25: For the lower part of the wealth distribution, the effect of drought-related
    illness on household budget is estimated close to 90 PPP USD.
  26: Additional expenditures due to drought-related illness can pose a non-negligible
    burden, representing 10% of median total per-capita consumption and 18% of average
    food consumption for the lower wealth group; 16% of average total per-capita consumption
    and 34% of average food consumption for the upper wealth group.
  32: The coefficients for the relationship between different drought indicators and
    illness, adjusted R-squared values, AIC values, and F-statistics are provided.
