Drivers of Risk:
  1: Milder winter temperatures and/or increased snow depth (which insulates the ground)
  2: Changes in air temperature, snow accumulation, and sea ice alter travel times.
  3: Climate change is leading to reduced sea ice concentration and thickness, impacting
    travel times and accessibility.
  4: Projected changes enable increased destination shipping and elevate the risk
    of environmental damage from spills and discharge with maritime development of
    resources.
Highlights:
  1: "All eight Arctic states are projected to suffer steep declines (\u221211 to\
    \ \u221282%) in accessibility inland, driven by lost potential for winter road\
    \ construction."
  2: Arctic littoral states are projected to gain increased maritime access to their
    EEZs, while inland areas face longer travel times due to declining winter road
    potential.
  3: By mid-century, there will be an increase in maritime access to Arctic offshore
    EEZs, and regions with current access will experience faster travel speeds.
  4: By mid-century, the Northern Sea Route and North Pole route will be fully accessible
    to Type A vessels from July to September.
Methodology:
  2: ATAM simulations of travel time to nearest settlement (TTNS) are presented for
    baseline (2000-2014) and mid-century (2045-2059) for November.
  4: "The analysis uses the Arctic Transportation Accessibility Model (ATAM) with\
    \ ensemble-mean simulations from the Community Climate System Model 3.0 (CCSM3)\
    \ for the periods 2000\u20132014 and 2045\u20132059 under the A1B SRES scenario."
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the impact of climate change on transportation systems in
    northern latitudes, specifically the accessibility of oceans and landscapes due
    to changes in sea ice and winter road conditions. The paper models the projected
    impacts of climate change on maritime and inland transportation systems using
    the Arctic Transport Accessibility Model (ATAM).
  2: The paper focuses on changes in transportation accessibility as a result of climate
    change.
Outcome(s) of Interest:

Quantitative material:
  2: Increased maritime access to EEZs for Greenland (+28%), Canada (+19%), Russia
    (+16%), and the United States (+5%).  Projected increase for Arctic Ocean high
    seas (+406%). Lost winter road potential in Canada (-13%), Finland (-41%), Greenland
    (-11%), Norway (-51%), Russia (-13%), and USA (Alaska) (-29%).
