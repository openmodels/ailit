Drivers of Risk:
  6: Projected changes in annual-average regional climate, specifically temperature
    and precipitation, in East Africa.
  8: The drivers of risk discussed are related to climate change, including changes
    in surface temperature and precipitation patterns affecting plant functional types
    and biome distributions.
  19: Increases in simulated Net Primary Productivity (NPP) leading to increased fuel
    load; Lack of substantial future change in dry season rainfall amount or timing;
    Changes in wet and dry season rainfall; CO2-induced reductions in stomatal conductance
    and evapotranspiration; Seasonality in precipitation and soil water balance
  20: Climate change (temperature, precipitation), leading to changes in land cover;
    human land-use change interacting with climate impacts; population increases;
    urbanization.
  21: Increasing temperatures impacting highland maize and bean production; Decreases
    in grass cover impacting pastoralism; Potential for increased freshwater availability
    countered by increased flood risk and soil erosion; Potential for increased pathogen
    loads; Water stress for maize in lower elevation areas.
Highlights:
  6: The page highlights projected changes in temperature and precipitation in East
    Africa using climate models.  It identifies model groupings based on projection
    similarities and differences.
  8: The LPJ model may be underestimating the carbon storage of East African forests
    due to the predicted occurrence of grasses and the limited representation of disjunct
    mountains at the grid cell size.
  19: Future climate change impacts wildfire carbon emissions (Cfire) through changes
    in fuel load, soil moisture, and fire season length. Different GCMs project different
    changes in precipitation and soil moisture, leading to variation in predicted
    Cfire. Some GCMs predict increased Cfire due to increased fuel load, while others
    predict decreased Cfire due to increased moisture levels. The HadGEM1 climate
    model, which predicts decreased precipitation, leads to the largest increases
    in burnt area and Cfire.
  20: Future climate-induced changes in land cover will occur concurrently with human-induced
    changes in land use. Human-driven transitions may have larger impacts on ecosystems
    than climate shifts. The impact of changes in climate and land use will be felt
    in agriculture. Projected population increases in East Africa are significant.
  21: Tropical maize may still thrive in the 2080-2100 period as average temperatures
    increase, but in many of these environments, water limitations may induce yield
    declines. Tropical highland maize and bean production is likely to decline in
    a warmer future climate. Decreases that are projected in grass cover may have
    potentially serious implications for pastoralism in the region.
Methodology:
  6: The analysis uses climate models (GCMs) and the CRU05 baseline dataset to project
    temperature and precipitation changes in East Africa from 1900 to 2100, calculating
    10-year running means. The projections are for the period 2080-2099 relative to
    1981-2000.  GCMs are grouped in terms of their climate projections.
  8: "The analysis uses the LPJ model and CRU05 dataset to simulate plant functional\
    \ types and biome distributions based on climate variables, averaging over the\
    \ period 1981\u20132000."
  19: LPJ dynamic global vegetation model driven by climate data (CRU05 and nine GCMs).
    Future climate projections are for the period 2080-2099, compared to a baseline
    of 1981-2000.
  20: LPJ model simulations are used to project changes in Net Primary Production
    (NPP) and carbon storage in East Africa under the SRES A2 emissions scenario,
    considering climate change impacts on vegetation. The model simulates stomatal
    conductance changes under higher CO2 concentrations. The results are applicable
    to broad, regional patterns, but not finer spatial detail, and don't account for
    human land-use, or phosphorous/nitrogen limitation.
  21: The study uses the LPJ model, simulating ecosystem function to project future
    impacts on ecosystem goods and services, with a focus on water and food security.
    It uses different GCMs and emission scenarios to assess future climate impacts.
    The LPJ model in this study does not take account of human-driven changes in land
    cover. The analysis considers annual mean temperatures and changes in runoff.
More Notes:
  6: "The study focuses on the East African region (12.51N\u201312.51S, 25\u201342.51E).\
    \ The table provides specific temperature and rainfall values and percentage changes\
    \ for various GCMs. Ensemble data is used by some models."
  8: The study emphasizes spatial patterns of dominant plant types and identifies
    various biomes like tropical evergreen forest (TEFO), tropical semi-deciduous
    forest (TSFO), etc., based on plant functional type and LAI distributions.
  19: The study acknowledges that future changes in human-induced fires, which are
    affected by demographic trends and practices, are not considered. The length of
    the fire season in LPJ is defined by the number of days the soil moisture is below
    a threshold for fuel ignition.
  21: The LPJ model incorporates physiological effects of elevated CO2, which leads
    to direct stimulation of plant productivity and indirect stimulation through increases
    in plant water-use-efficiency.

Quantitative material:
  6: "Table 3 provides annual-average surface temperature (\xB0C) and rainfall (mm\
    \ day\u207B\xB9) averaged over the East African region for 1981\u20132000 and\
    \ 2080\u20132099, as well as the absolute and percentage differences between these\
    \ periods for CRU05 and several GCMs (MRI, CCSM3, HADCM3, CNRM, CGCM3, HADGEM1,\
    \ GFDL, CSIRO, ECHAM5)."
  8: "The page includes quantitative data on surface temperature (\xB0C), precipitation\
    \ (mm day\u20131), and vegetation C storage (kg C m\u207B\xB2)."
  19: The length of the fire season is greatest for the Groups 3 and 4 GCMs. The wet
    Groups 1 and 2 GCMs simulate the lowest annual fire frequencies, i.e. lowest annual
    area burnt (Table 5). This translates into the lowest Cfire for the present-day
    (Table 4) for the Group 2 GCMs. The Group 1 GCMs simulate high Cfire due to the
    dominant effect of high fuel loads. This is especially the case for MRI. The dry
    GCM Groups, 3 and 4, generally lead to high simulated fire frequencies and the
    largest Cfire values (Tables 4 and 5). Under the future climate, Group 1 and 2
    GCMs generally result in the lowest simulated percentage changes in Cfire (Table
    4) due to high moisture levels. The Group 3 simulations exhibit the largest percentage
    increases in Cfire. Simulations driven by HadGEM1, which exhibits future precipitation
    decreases in the early part of the dry season, show the largest increase both
    in burnt area and Cfire.
  20: Table 6 presents absolute and percentage changes in carbon fluxes (NPP, NEE,
    Cfire) and carbon pools (VegC, SoilC) across East Africa between 1980-1999 and
    2080-2099. The changes are based on multi-GCM driven LPJ simulations and are compared
    to simulations using one GCM and four SRES emission scenarios.
  21: "Mean change in runoff across the simulations is 94 mm yr/C or a 19% increase\
    \ in 2080-2100 compared with 1981\u20132000; Projected increases in carbon storage\
    \ in the region (3\u201313%)."
