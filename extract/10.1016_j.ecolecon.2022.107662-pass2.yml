Drivers of Risk:
  1: Annual weather fluctuations.
  2: Temperature (increase) and precipitation (increase/decrease).
  3: Temperature changes and rainfall fluctuations
  4: Climate change affects livestock directly through reproduction processes, feed
    conversion ratio, and health (emergence/spread of diseases). Indirect effects
    include impacts on water availability, feed access/quality, and increased morbidity.
    Specific drivers mentioned are increased temperature, changes in precipitation
    patterns (droughts, floods), and pathogen/parasite activity.

Highlights:
  1: No relevant information
  2: Temperature increases reduce beef production, especially in hot, poor, and agriculture-dependent
    countries; the impact of precipitation varies by climate zone; climate change
    will significantly reduce animal output.
  3: Temperature changes have a robust negative effect on global livestock production;
    rainfall fluctuations have a positive impact. The effect of temperature is more
    concentrated in hot, poor, and agricultural-dependent countries. Rainfall in the
    tropical regions moderates temperature-caused adverse effects, while adverse affects
    are further aggravated by rainfall in the temperate regions.
  4: The study aims to analyze the general pass-through effect of annual weather fluctuations
    on global livestock production, not to determine the individual contributions
    of each channel.
  5: Weather variation does not Granger-cause beef production, but the reverse is
    not the case.
  6: "Temperature increases are predicted across all regions in the medium and long\
    \ term. Changes in precipitation and animal production vary by region and time\
    \ horizon. A 1\xB0C increase in temperature will lead to a 9.7% reduction in beef\
    \ production."
  7: The adverse impacts of temperature changes are more severe in hot, poor, and
    agriculture-dependent countries. Precipitation has a positive effect in tropical
    and agriculture-dependent countries. The quadratic term of temperature is significant,
    indicating a non-linear relationship between temperature and beef production.
  8: The various sensitivity tests show that the baseline estimates measuring the
    impact of annual weather fluctuations on beef production are robust.
  9: Temperature has a statistically significant negative impact on cereal yield and
    production, while precipitation has a statistically significant positive impact.
    The magnitudes of these impacts vary across aggregate, tropical, poor, and agriculture-dependent
    countries.
  10: Global warming plays a more significant role in determining livestock output
    than predicted changes in rainfall patterns in the longer term. Poor and agricultural-dependent
    countries located in the tropics are severely affected by warming. The overall
    adverse effect of climate change on beef production is almost completely centered
    in tropical countries.
  11: Spatial distribution of predicted climate change aggregate impact on beef production.
Methodology:
  1: Re-examining the impact of weather fluctuations. The results are applicable to
    global livestock production.
  2: Uses country-level panel data and an established econometric strategy; forecasts
    are based on the assumption of no adaptation other than the degree of adaptation
    observed in the historical period.
  3: Panel data analysis of national livestock production and local weather fluctuations
    from 187 countries; accounts for omitted variable bias; does not account for adaptation
    or inter-seasonal changes in weather.
  4: The study uses a reduced-form framework to analyze the general pass-through effect
    of annual weather fluctuations on global livestock production. It uses country-level
    cattle production data from FAOSTAT and historical weather data from the University
    of Delaware. Cattle population-weighted weather averages are used to account for
    heterogeneity.
  5: Panel data model at country/year level, with country fixed effects and region-specific
    trends. Spatial and serial correlation in standard errors are addressed using
    the approach described in Hsiang (2010). Panel Granger causality Wald test performed.
  6: The analysis uses error-corrected ACCESS SSP3.70, adjusted for spatial (1000
    km) and serial (3-years) correlation. It models changes in temperature and precipitation
    and their impact on log animal production.
  7: "Panel data analysis with country fixed effects and region-specific trends, sample\
    \ period 1961\u20132017. Standard errors are adjusted for spatial and serial correlation.\
    \ Countries are classified as tropical/temperate based on median temperature,\
    \ rich/poor based on World Bank classification, and agriculture-dependent based\
    \ on share of GDP in agriculture in 2000."
  8: "The analysis uses country fixed effects and region-specific trends, with standard\
    \ errors adjusted for spatial (1,000km) and serial (3-years) correlation. The\
    \ sample period is 1961\u20132017."
  9: The analysis uses a panel data model with country fixed effects and region-specific
    trends, covering the period 1961-2017. Standard errors are adjusted for both spatial
    (1,000km) and serial (3-years) correlation.
  10: Panel data from 1961 to 2017, Long difference estimations, ACCESS-ESM1.5 mid-term
    and long-run scenarios (SSP3-7.0, relative to a 1981-2010 baseline). Claims this
    method exploits the exogeneity of cross-time variations in weather.
  11: Panel data model; long differences method.

  2: Focuses on beef production. The introduction also notes agriculture is of global
    importance as it employs more than 70% of the world population.
  6: The predicted changes are based on a specific climate model (ACCESS SSP3.70)
    and scenario, so the results may vary with other models or scenarios. The impact
    of temperature is higher in tropical regions.
  8: The paper investigates the impact of weather changes on beef production via its
    impact on crop production, specifically cereal yields and cereal production. Table
    4 (described but not included) shows that increased temperature negatively impacts
    cereal yields and production, especially in hot countries. Increased precipitation
    positively impacts cereal yields.
  10: Study acknowledges limitations of panel data method in capturing inter-annual
    tradeoffs and potential short-run inventory changes.
  11: The model does not account for adaptation to gradual changes in climate.
Quantitative material:
  1: No relevant information
  2: "A 1\u25E6C increase in temperature will lead to a 9.7% reduction in global beef\
    \ production on average; marginal increase in annual precipitation would lead\
    \ to a 2.1% increase in beef production in tropical countries but a 1.9% decrease\
    \ in temperate ones; climate change will reduce animal output by a further 20%\
    \ in the mid-century and an additional 40% by the end of the century."
  3: Climate change will reduce animal output by a further 20% in the mid-century
    and an additional 40% by the end of the century.
  5: "The model predicts a 2.2\xB0C rise in global temperature in the mid-future (2041-2060)\
    \ with North America and MENA experiencing more warming. Latin America and Caribbean\
    \ (LAC) will experience a fall in total rainfall. By the end of the century (2061-2100),\
    \ global warming is predicted to double the mid-future change. North America and\
    \ ECA are predicted to have the highest temperature rise, and LAC and EAP will\
    \ experience reduction in total rainfall."
  6: "The paper includes summary statistics of historical data (1961-2017) and predicted\
    \ medium-term (2041-2060) and long-term (2061-2100) climate change, including\
    \ percentage changes from historical figures. It also states a 1\xB0C increase\
    \ in temperature leads to a 9.7% reduction in beef production overall."
  7: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature has a greater adverse effect on beef production\
    \ in agriculture-dependent countries (4x larger). A 1 mm increase in annual precipitation\
    \ would lead to a 2.1% increase in beef production in tropical countries, but\
    \ a 1.9% decline in temperate regions. An extra mm of annual precipitation would\
    \ generate a 3% improvement in beef production in agriculture-dependent countries."
  8: Table 3 shows the impact of various robustness checks on the coefficients for
    lagged temperature, lagged precipitation, log temperature, and weather interaction.
    The table includes coefficient estimates and standard errors. Significant levels
    are indicated by asterisks (***, **, * for 1%, 5%, and 10% respectively).
  9: Table 4 provides quantitative estimates of the impact of temperature and precipitation
    (and their squares) on cereal yield (ton/ha) and production (kg) for aggregate,
    tropical, poor, and agriculture-dependent countries. For example, a 1 degree Celsius
    increase in temperature is associated with a -0.0372 ton/ha change in aggregate
    yield [p<0.01] and a -0.076 kg change in aggregate production [p<0.01].
  10: "A 1 \xB0C increase in temperature will lead to a 9.7% reduction in beef production\
    \ on average, with most of this effect centered in tropical countries. Poorer\
    \ countries would also experience a 27% reduction as opposed to 4% in countries\
    \ with higher income levels. An additional mm increase in annual precipitation\
    \ would lead to a 2.1% increase in production in tropical countries but a 1.9%\
    \ decrease in temperate ones. Predicted loss in global beef production due to\
    \ climate change in 2060 ranges from 11% (in temperate regions) to 36% (in tropical\
    \ areas)."
