Drivers of Risk:
  2: Weather fluctuations, specifically temperature increase and changes in annual
    precipitation.
  3: Temperature changes and rainfall fluctuations as a result of climate change.
  5: "Annual average temperature (in \xB0C) and yearly total precipitation (in mm/year)."
  6: Average temperature (oC), Total precipitation (mm)
  7: Temperature changes and precipitation changes impact beef production.
  8: Weather changes, specifically temperature and precipitation fluctuations, are
    impacting beef and cereal production.
  9: Temperature (degrees Celsius), Precipitation (mm per year).
  10: Temperature changes (in degrees Celsius) and precipitation changes (in mm units
    per year).
  11: Temperature and precipitation changes (climate change).
Highlights:
  2: Temperature increases significantly reduce beef production, particularly in hot,
    poor, and agriculture-dependent countries. The effect of precipitation varies
    by climate zone.
  3: Temperature increases negatively impact global livestock production, especially
    in hot, poor, and agricultural-dependent countries, while rainfall has a positive
    impact.
  5: Weather variation does not Granger-cause beef production, but the reverse is
    not the case.
  6: Temperature has a negative and statistically significant relationship with beef
    production; a 1 oC increase in temperature will lead to a 9.7% reduction in beef
    production.
  7: Temperature changes have more severe negative impacts on beef production in hot,
    poor, and agriculture-dependent countries.
  8: The analysis shows that temperature increases have significant negative impacts
    on crop and beef production, especially in tropical, poor, and agriculture-dependent
    countries.
  9: Temperature has a negative impact on cereal yield and production, while precipitation
    has a positive impact. The magnitude of these impacts varies across different
    country groups (aggregate, tropical, poor, agriculture-dependent). The study does
    not find evidence that beef production is affected by changes in medium-term average
    weather conditions.
  10: Climate change negatively affects livestock production, especially in poor and
    tropical regions. Predicted loss in global beef production due to climate change
    in 2060 ranges from 11% in temperate regions to 36% in tropical areas. The effect
    of global warming dominates that of rainfall changes.
  11: Climate change is predicted to negatively impact beef production, with varying
    regional impacts and increasing severity over time (2041-2060 vs. 2081-2100).
Methodology:
  2: Country-level panel data analysis using an econometric strategy to examine the
    relationship between weather changes and global livestock production.
  3: Panel data analysis of national livestock production and local weather fluctuations
    from 187 countries, using group fixed effects to account for omitted variables.
  5: Panel data model at country/year level with country fixed effects and region-specific
    trends. Spatial and serial correlation in standard errors are controlled for using
    the approach described in Hsiang (2010) with an arbitrary distance of 1000 km
    and time lag of 3 years.
  6: Error-corrected climate change model. Errors adjusted for spatial (1000 km) and
    serial (3-years) correlation.
  7: Analysis includes panel data with temperature and precipitation variables with
    country fixed effects and region-specific trends; includes robustness checks with
    lagged weather outcomes and log transformations.
  8: "The analysis uses various specifications and robustness checks (e.g., excluding\
    \ SSA, using a balanced panel dataset) to assess the impact of weather changes\
    \ on beef production from 1961\u20132017."
  9: Panel data regressions with country fixed effects and region-specific trends.
    Standard errors are adjusted for spatial and serial correlation. Long differences
    (LD) approach. Climate change projection using regression estimates with forecasted
    climate changes.
  10: Panel data analysis from 1961 to 2017, using long differences and panel estimates,
    exploiting exogeneity of cross-time variations in weather.
  11: Panel data model (unspecified), long differences method.
More Notes:
  2: The study considers adaptation but only to the degree observed in the historical
    period when forecasting future impacts.
  3: The methodology does not account for adaptation, which would attenuate the damage
    estimate. The results should be seen as 'middle-of-the-road' estimates due to
    the lack of accounting for adaptation and inter-seasonal weather changes.
  6: The impact of temperature is higher in tropical regions than in temperate regions;
    a 1 oC increase in temperature will result in about a 20% fall in cattle production
    in tropical countries, but there is no significant effect in temperate regions.
    A 1 oC increase in temperature will reduce animal production by 27% in poor countries
    and 4% in rich ones.
  10: Study acknowledges limitations of panel data methods in accounting for inter-annual
    farmer tradeoffs and picking up short-run changes in inventory.
  11: The model does not fully account for adaptation strategies at the country level.
    Absence of adaptation should be considered in reference to country-level observation.

Quantitative material:
  2: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature will lead to a 9.7% reduction in global beef\
    \ production on average. A marginal increase in annual precipitation would lead\
    \ to a 2.1% increase in beef production in tropical countries but a 1.9% decrease\
    \ in temperate ones. Climate change will reduce animal output by a further 20%\
    \ in the mid-century and an additional 40% by the end of the century assuming\
    \ no adaptation other than the degree of adaptation observed in the historical\
    \ period."
  3: Climate change will reduce animal output by a further 20% in the mid-century
    and an additional 40% by the end of the century.
  5: "The model predicts a 2.2 \xB0C rise in global temperature in the mid-future\
    \ (2041\u20132060) and doubling of this change by the end of the century (2061-2100)\
    \ under the ACESSS SSP3.70 scenario."
  6: Table 1 presents summary statistics of historical data (1961-2017) and predicted
    changes in average temperature, total precipitation, and log animal production
    for the periods 2041-2060 and 2061-2100, broken down by world regions, under ACCESS
    SSP3.70.
  7: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature has an adverse effect that is four times larger\
    \ in agricultural vs. non-agricultural economies."
  8: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature is associated with a 3.7% drop in cereal yields\
    \ and a 7.6% drop in global cereal production."
  9: Table 4 provides quantitative estimates of the impact of temperature and precipitation
    (including squared terms) on cereal yield (ton/ha) and production (kg) for aggregate,
    tropical, poor, and agriculture-dependent countries, along with standard errors
    and significance levels. The sample period is 1961-2017.
  10: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature leads to a 9.7% reduction in beef production\
    \ globally, with larger effects in tropical (36% loss predicted by 2060) and poorer\
    \ countries (27% reduction). Additional mm increase in annual precipitation leads\
    \ to a 2.1% increase in production in tropical countries but a 1.9% decrease in\
    \ temperate ones."
  11: "Spatial distribution of predicted climate change aggregate impact on beef production\
    \ (in logs), maps show temperature increase of 0.2\xB0C to >0.8\xB0C in various\
    \ regions."
