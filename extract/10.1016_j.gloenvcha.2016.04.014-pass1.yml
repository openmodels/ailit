Drivers of Risk:
  1: Spatiotemporal variability in temperature and precipitation at the origin; increase
    in positive temperature extremes as well as positive and negative excess rainfall
    at the origin; adverse climatic conditions.
  3: Positive anomalies of 5-year averages of maximum temperature; Negative anomalies
    of 5-year averages of minimum temperature; Positive and negative anomalies of
    5-year averages of rainy-season precipitation; Measure of soil moisture.
  5: Positive temperature anomalies, negative precipitation anomalies, and soil moisture.
  7: "Precipitation and temperature anomalies (droughts, floods, cold spells, and\
    \ heat waves); drought stress during the flowering and grain-filling stages of\
    \ cereal crops; high temperatures (above 30\xB0C) impacting maize yields."
  8: "Projected temperature increase by 1.5-2.0 \xB0C under the RCP4.5 scenario in\
    \ 2081\u20132100 (over the 1986\u20132005 baseline). Projected precipitation decrease\
    \ by about 10% in the same period, especially in the southern and western interior."
Highlights:
  1: Climate acts as a push factor enhancing out-migration, but the significance of
    the effect varies by migrant characteristics, with Black and low-income South
    African migrants more strongly influenced by climatic variables. Agriculture may
    function as a transmission channel through which climate affects migration.
  3: Positive anomalies in maximum temperature and negative anomalies in precipitation
    are associated with increased migration flows.
  5: Climatic variables have a more significant and stronger effect on black and low-income
    migrants compared to white and higher-income ones.  Higher positive maximum temperature
    anomalies and lower values of soil moisture enhance migration more strongly in
    districts characterized by higher employment in agriculture.
  7: Agriculture is a possible channel through which harmful climatic impacts may
    induce population mobility; asymmetry of effects that precipitation and temperature
    anomalies have on migration; droughts tend to be more temporally persistent than
    wet periods; maize yields are particularly sensitive to drought stress and high
    temperatures.
Methodology:
  1: Gravity model approach where bilateral migration flows are explained by climate
    variability at the origin, along with geographic, socio-economic and demographic
    factors. Applicable to post-apartheid South Africa using census data from 1997-2001
    and 2007-2011.
  3: Panel data analysis using Poisson Pseudo Maximum-Likelihood (PPML) estimation.
    A gravity model is used to analyze inter-district migration flows in South Africa.
    The model includes bilateral variables (distance, contiguity), demographic and
    socio-economic factors, and climatic variables. The analysis uses data from 2001
    and 2011 and accounts for spatial autocorrelation and geographic factors.
  5: PPML panel gravity-model regressions are used to analyze the impact of climate
    variables on migration flows, conditioning on migrant characteristics. The analysis
    considers 5-year migration flows.
  7: Econometric specifications of a gravity model to analyze migration flows; panel
    gravity models to represent internal migration flows; the study acknowledges that
    their models do not take into account spatial autocorrelation.
More Notes:
  1: The paper investigates the impact of climate variability on internal migration
    flows in South Africa, framing migration as a potential adaptation strategy.
  3: The study focuses on internal migration within South Africa and doesn't directly
    estimate macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level. The climate
    variables are constructed using 5-year averages of temperature and precipitation
    anomalies relative to a long-run mean (1950-2011).
  7: The study acknowledges limitations regarding spatial autocorrelation in climate
    data and migration flows. It suggests future research could employ spatial econometrics
    to address this. The study also suggests complementing macro-level analysis of
    migration flows with a micro-approach to identify environmental and non-environmental
    determinants of individual migration decisions and potential constraints to individual
    mobility.
  8: The page provides a regional breakdown of South Africa by districts and provinces
    (Table A1) and describes the climatic zones of South Africa. It also includes
    maps of average precipitation and temperature from 1950-2011, disaggregated at
    the district council level.
  9: This page focuses on environmental migration as a consequence of climate change.
    It does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes or the costs
    and benefits of adaptation at a national level. It does provide context for how
    climate change can indirectly influence economies through migration patterns.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: "Indirect impact on income and employment opportunities of people working in\
    \ the agricultural sector (or in industries strongly dependent on it), household\
    \ consumption, urbanization via rural\u2013urban migration."
  3: Inter-district migration flow of adults (15-64 years old)
  5: Migration flows broken down according to age classes, gender, marital status,
    ethnic group, and income.
  7: Population mobility (migration) induced by harmful climatic impacts; impact on
    maize yields.
Quantitative material:
  1: "No specific quantitative estimates of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes are provided\
    \ on this page, but the paper uses a panel database covering the waves 1997\u2013\
    2001 and 2007\u20132011 to examine the effect of climate variability on inter-district\
    \ migration flows."
