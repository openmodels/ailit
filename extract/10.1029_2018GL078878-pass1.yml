Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate-driven changes in the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, changes in oceanic
    haline stratification, changes in gyre structure, a newly identified circulation-salinity
    feedback, increased density layering at the continental shelf edge, changes in
    the large-scale ocean circulation and salinity, disruption of the density-driven
    circulation of the North Sea, changes in the flow of water from the North Atlantic
    into the North Sea.
Highlights:
  2: Demonstrates a direct oceanic link between climate-driven change in the North
    Atlantic and Arctic Oceans and the circulation of the northwest European shelf
    seas, showing a shutdown of the exchange between the Atlantic and the North Sea
    and a substantial decrease in the circulation of the North Sea in the second half
    of the 21st century.
Methodology:
  2: Downscaling experiments using a high-resolution shelf sea model to demonstrate
    how end-of-century changes in the wider ocean can lead to a substantial reduction
    in the flow of water from the North Atlantic into the North Sea.
More Notes:
  2: The North Sea would become more estuarine and susceptible to anthropogenic influence
    with an enhanced risk of coastal eutrophication, The paper emphasizes the need
    to understand better the many ways climate change can influence the marine environment
    and its ecosystems.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Enhanced risk of coastal eutrophication, disturbances to marine ecosystems (e.g.,
    depletion of oxygen near the seabed), disruption of larvae transport, increased
    retention of pollutants.
Quantitative material:
  2: "Northern North Sea inflow decreases from 1.2\u20131.3 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3/s) to\
    \ 0.0\u20130.6 Sv."
