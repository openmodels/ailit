Drivers of Risk:
  3: Climate change, specifically changes in precipitation and temperature.
  4: Climate change impacts such as increased temperatures, desertification, salinization,
    flooding, salinization risks on coasts, and changes in water resource variability.
  5: Climate change and extreme weather events are threats to Colombian agriculture;
    Pests and diseases impact production costs.
  6: Shifts in geographic distribution and incidence of pests and diseases, extreme
    weather events, and changes in temperature, precipitation, and seasonality.
  8: "Projected increases in annual mean temperature (average of 2.5\xBAC increase\
    \ by the 2050s), with variations across regions. Projected increase in precipitation\
    \ (average of 2.5% by the 2050s), also with regional variations."
  9: Changes in precipitation and temperature impacting plant growth, soil water availability,
    and biotic factors (pests, diseases, weeds).
  10: Changes in phenology due to higher temperatures, increases in pest and disease
    prevalence, climate variability, flooding in coastal areas, progressive losses
    of crop and pasture suitability.
  11: Climate change impacts on agriculture; Phonological alterations; Climate variability;
    Temperature increases; Lodging in sugarcane
  15: Changes in crop phenology, shifts in pest and disease distribution, changes
    in climatic niche of coffee, potential decreases in sugarcane yields.
  22: "Changes in temperature (2-2.5\xBAC and 2.5-3\xBAC increases) and precipitation\
    \ (-3-0%, 0-3%, and 3-5% changes) under the SRES-A2 emission scenario."
  24: Predicted changes in climate (temperature and rainfall)
Highlights:
  3: Climate change could impact 14% of Colombia's national GDP (agriculture) by 2050
    under the SRES-A2 scenario. Without adaptation measures, 80% of crops would be
    impacted in more than 60% of their current areas of cultivation.
  4: Colombia's National Development Plan includes a framework for a National Adaptation
    Plan, focusing on sectors affected by climate impacts.
  5: Climate change will have severe impacts on Colombian agriculture and the socio-economic
    system; Colombian agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate change; Extreme
    weather events constrain Colombian agricultural systems.
  6: Climate change requires substantial and continued governmental support aimed
    at reducing short-term vulnerability and maintaining and enhancing food-security;
    The study analyzes the impact of climate change on Colombian perennial and annual
    crops by considering climatic changes and their distribution within these cropped
    surfaces.
  9: Climate change will impact agricultural production at different levels, particularly
    affecting smallholders. Precipitation is expected to be a fundamental factor driving
    impacts and adaptation.
  10: "Climate change could lead to yield reductions and increased production costs\
    \ in Colombian agriculture, especially for niche-specific crops like coffee. Sugarcane\
    \ is predicted to suffer yield loss if temperatures rise above +1\xB0C in the\
    \ Cauca river basin. There could be some yield-reduction mitigation due to the\
    \ increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations."
  11: Adaptation strategies can offset negative impacts of climate change on agriculture,
    specifically for rice and sugarcane. Coffee requires special attention due to
    its economic importance. Transversal adaptation measures are needed across all
    sectors and crops.
  15: Governmental support for research and agricultural insurance is critical for
    adaptation.
  22: "Significant variation in impacts across crops. For example, almost all sugarcane\
    \ experiences a 2-2.5\xB0C temperature increase with 98.9% experiencing a 3-5%\
    \ increase in precipitation, while soybeans almost exclusively experience a 2.5-3\xB0\
    C temperature increase and a 3-5% increase in precipitation. Some crops like plantains\
    \ and bananas are projected to experience a 100% area under 2-2.5 degree temperature\
    \ increases."

    along with associated uncertainties, using climate models
Methodology:
  3: Uses 17 Global Circulation Model (GCM) outputs to quantify how Colombian agricultural
    production may be affected by climate change under the A2 scenario of the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES-A2).
  5: Impacts of climate change on Colombian agriculture are analyzed using a set of
    17 global circulation models (GCMs) for the SRES-A2 emission scenario for the
    2050s time frame.
  6: Literature and statistical data review; Using the first communication to the
    UNFCCC as a baseline; Analysis of climate model data to draw conclusions on climate
    model skill in Colombia; Downscaling GCM data to a 10 arc-minute resolution using
    the method of Ramirez-Villegas and Jarvis (2010); Analyzing climatic changes and
    their distribution within cropped surfaces as derived from the latest census of
    the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE, 2007); Analysis of
    impacts and proposing major adaptation strategies for the sector.
  9: Classification of changes in precipitation and temperature for Colombian agriculture
    (see methods in supporting material, Sect. 5). Impacts up to the 2050s.
  10: Understanding impacts and testing adaptation options like varietal changes and
    changes in planting dates.
  11: "Analysis based on work by CIAT and EMBRAPA. Sugarcane research involves progenitor\
    \ selection, crosses and varietal evaluation in \u201Chomologue\u201D zones to\
    \ future conditions."
  15: Numerical and qualitative assessments of impacts and adaptation options were
    performed for agricultural sector.
  22: The analysis projects the impact of temperature and precipitation changes under
    the SRES-A2 emission scenario on different crops by calculating the percentage
    of current cropland area that will experience these changes.
  24: Analysis uses General Circulation Models (GCMs) and PRECIS regional climate
    model runs; details are in supporting materials Sect. 2 and reasons for model
    selection in Sect. 4 of supporting material
