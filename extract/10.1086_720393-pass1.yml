  1: Impacts of temperature during the Little Ice Age on agricultural productivity
    and mortality.
  2: Long-term temperature change (cooling and subsequent warming associated with
    the Little Ice Age).
  3: Relatively cool temperatures during the Little Ice Age.
  4: Cooler temperatures during the Little Ice Age
  5: Long-term and gradual temperature changes.
  8: Shorter growing periods reduce the harvest.
  10: Temperature changes during the Little Ice Age (1600-1850).
  11: A decrease in long-term mean temperature (specifically, the Little Ice Age)
    is associated with decreases in city size.
  12: "Change in mean temperature (\xB0C)"
  15: Changes in long-run mean temperature (specifically decreases during the Little
    Ice Age)
  17: Temperature changes, specifically the fraction of years with mean temperatures
    in different temperature bins.
  18: Temperature variations (yearly mean temperature, growing-season temperature,
    and nongrowing-season temperature)
  19: Mean temperature, Growing-season temperature, Nongrowing-season temperature
  20: Temperature changes during the growing season affecting agricultural productivity,
    specifically wheat prices.
  21: Temperature changes affecting mortality and agricultural productivity, indirectly
    impacting economic well-being.
  22: Temperature changes, specifically decreases in agricultural year and growing-season
    temperatures, and distance from markets (acting as a modifier of the temperature
    impact).

  40: No explicit shocks or changes impacting economic outcomes specified on this
    page.
Highlights:
  1: Important economic effects of long-term climate change observed during 1600-1850
    as economies adapted by increasing trade and altering land use.
  2: The study examines the economic effects of long-run temperature change over a
    period of 250 years, when people have time to adapt, using the Little Ice Age
    as a case study.
  3: Significant negative impact of cool temperatures on city size, with linear relationship
    fitting most of the temperature distribution.
  4: Cooler temperatures increased mortality, likely through impacts on agricultural
    productivity; Trade volumes increased in response to cooler temperatures, driven
    by cooler growing seasons; Cities participating in long-distance maritime trade
    experienced smaller economic effects from temperature change; Cities with larger
    trade opportunities were less affected by temperature change; Cities with flat
    terrain surrounding them were less affected by temperature changes.
  5: The study shows the vulnerability of economies heavily dependent on agriculture
    with restricted access to trade.
  8: Small changes in key agricultural dates (related to temperature) had potentially
    large effects on living standards.
  10: City growth was slowed down by relatively cold temperatures.
  11: There's a positive relationship between temperature and city size. During the
    Little Ice Age, cities that experienced a larger decrease in long-term mean temperature
    (strong cooling) had lower city growth (8.514) compared to cities with a smaller
    decrease (weak cooling) (17.589).
  12: The scatter plot and regression line indicate a positive correlation between
    change in mean temperature and change in city size.
  15: Relatively cool temperatures during the Little Ice Age had a negative effect
    on city size.
  17: "Cooler years are correlated with smaller city sizes; very cold years experienced\
    \ the smallest growth. The effect on city size increases almost linearly with\
    \ temperature until about 17\xB0C, after which the effect declines. Temperatures\
    \ above 19\xB0C had a negative, but not significant, impact on city growth. The\
    \ negative effect of especially cold years drives the relationship between temperature\
    \ and city size."
  18: Higher temperatures are associated with higher yield ratios.
  19: Mean temperature has a statistically significant positive effect on both Yield
    Ratio and Wheat Prices.
  20: Warmer growing season temperatures significantly increase yield ratios but decrease
    wheat prices.
  21: Temperature's impact on mortality through agricultural productivity, suggesting
    malnutrition as a potential driver.
  22: Lower temperatures, particularly during the growing season, led to increases
    in crisis mortality. Access to markets mitigated the adverse effects of temperature
    on crisis mortality; parishes far from markets experienced higher crisis mortality
    when temperatures fell.
  23: Increased temperatures (agricultural year mean, growing season) are statistically
    significantly associated with increased mortality crises.
  27: Cooler temperatures during the growing season led to an increase in the number
    of incoming ships and the value of imported goods. Cities with better access to
    trade (Sound toll traders) were significantly less affected by temperature changes
    compared with non-traders.
  30: Trade helps cities overcome adverse effects of temperature change, and the mitigating
    effect of trade is larger for cities that trade more.
  31: Trade served as an effective way of shielding an economy from the negative effects
    of temperature changes, especially for cities with many trading partners. The
    findings suggest that without trade, the impact of the Little Ice Age would have
    been significantly more severe for cities within the Sound toll trade network.
  32: Cities with high trade opportunities are less affected by temperature changes
    than cities with low trade opportunities. Ruggedness affects the degree to which
    temperature changes impacts trade.
  33: Cities with high trade opportunities and high ruggedness were negatively affected
    by temperature decreases. Cities with high trade opportunities and low ruggedness
    were not negatively affected and may have even benefited from temperature decreases.
  35: The results show a positive relationship between temperature and land use, suggesting
    that countries that were less cold during the Little Ice Age had more pasture
    and cropland.
  36: Trade is a key tool for adapting to long-term temperature changes. Economies
    that participate in long-distance trade are better able to respond to temperature
    changes. The agricultural sector is an important channel through which temperature
    affects the economy. Agriculture-dependent economies with limited access to trade
    are more vulnerable to climate change.
  40: No important outcomes of the analysis presented on this page.

    to estimate the impact of temperature on city size based on trade partner connections,
    specifically relating to the Sound toll and Hanseatic League trades.

More Notes:
  8: The study considers the impact of past temperature fluctuations (Little Ice Age)
    on the economy.
  11: The analysis is based on 2,120 European cities. The paper acknowledges that
    while current climate change is concerned with temperature increases, this study
    examines a period of temperature decrease (Little Ice Age) and its impact on city
    size. The paper also notes that agriculture in Northern Europe might benefit from
    small temperature increases given the area's cold climate.
  12: The analysis controls for city fixed effects (time-invariant city characteristics),
    time period fixed effects, and a number of other control variables interacted
    with time period indicator variables.
  17: The paper explores potential mechanisms through which temperature affects city
    size, including agricultural productivity, mortality, and migration.
  18: The analysis uses historical data to examine the impact of temperature on agricultural
    productivity. Access to Ocean and Atlantic Trader (interacted with time period
    indicator variables) are used as control variables
  19: The sample includes 12 cities in four European countries (France, Germany, Poland,
    and Sweden) for yield data and 10 European cities (Amsterdam, Antwerp, Leipzig,
    London, Madrid, Munich, Naples, Florence, Paris, and Strasbourg) for wheat price
    data.
  22: The paper uses crisis mortality as a proxy for the economic and social impact
    of climate variability. The study period is during the Little Ice Age, which has
    different economic characteristics than modern economies.
  23: The analysis considers both the impact of temperature in a single year and the
    average temperature over a 5-year period (t-1 to t-5).  It also examines differences
    in the effect of temperature on parishes close to and far from market towns.
  30: The paper explores the heterogeneity in the effect of temperature on trade based
    on trade intensity and participation in specific trade networks (Sound Toll Trade,
    Hanseatic League).
  31: The paper acknowledges that membership in the Hanseatic League may be correlated
    with other factors (e.g., human capital, diversified economy) that could have
    also helped overcome climate-related shocks.
  32: The study focuses on early modern Europe and uses the Sound Toll Registers as
    a source of trade data.
  33: The table examines how the impact of temperature on city size varies based on
    trade opportunities and terrain ruggedness.

Quantitative material:
  3: Panel data set for 2,120 European cities measuring annual temperatures and city
    size between 1500 and 1850.
  4: Data on mortality for 404 English parishes between 1538 and 1838; Data on location
    of birth and marriage for 6,350 couples in England between the years 1538 and
    1871; Data from the Sound Toll Registers on 900,000 ship passages to 750 European
    destinations between 1591 and 1857
  8: The main data set is a balanced panel of 2,120 European cities with annual temperature
    data.
  10: Roughly 80% of cities in the sample experienced temperature decreases between
    the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, with the remainder remaining close to
    zero (<0.0167C).
  11: The table provides summary statistics for city size in 1600, mean temperature
    in 1600, and city growth between 1600-1850, categorized by cities with strong
    vs. weak cooling.
  12: The figure displays a binned scatterplot corresponding to the estimates from
    column 2 of table 2, showing the relationship between change in mean temperature
    and change in city size.
  15: "A 1\xB0C change in long-term temperature changes city size by around 70%."
  17: The paper provides coefficient sizes and confidence intervals from regressions
    of log city size on temperature variables. Specific temperature bins and their
    corresponding impacts on city size are presented (e.g., cities with more cooler
    years tend to be smaller).
  18: Higher temperatures in 1 year are associated with higher yield ratios in the
    same year (based on regression analysis in column 1 of table 3)
  19: A 1 degree deviation increase in mean temperature increases yield ratio by 0.8
    (up from 5.57, an increase of 14%).
  20: A 1 standard deviation increase in growing-season temperature increases yield
    ratio by 0.58 (10.5% increase).
  22: A 1 standard deviation decrease in growing-season temperature increased the
    probability that mortality reached crisis level by 4.7% (compared with a mean
    of 5%). A 1 standard deviation decrease in agricultural year temperature in t-1
    increases crisis mortality by 8% in places far from markets and by 4.6% in places
    close to markets (the latter effect is not significant).
  23: Coefficients on temperature variables (agricultural year mean, growing-season,
    nongrowing season) in regressions predicting mortality crises, standard errors,
    number of observations, R-squared values for different model specifications.
  27: A 1 standard deviation decrease in growing-season temperature over the past
    25 years increases the number of incoming ships by 3%. For larger port cities,
    the same temperature change increases ship passages by 6.7%. Taxes representing
    1-2% of cargo value were used to assess the impact of temperature on the value
    of imported goods.
  30: A 1 standard deviation increase in mean temperature has a statistically significant
    impact on trade for cities with a higher number of trading partners.
  31: A 1 standard deviation decrease in temperature is estimated to reduce city size
    by 0.6% overall; for cities in the Sound toll trade with few trading partners,
    a 1 standard deviation decrease in temperature is estimated to reduce city size
    by 3.5%; not being part of the Sound toll trade network would have cost cities
    1,186,000 inhabitants or 3% of the total population of Sound toll cities over
    the study period, almost four times as high as the temperature effect that these
    trading cities actually experienced; Sound toll cities experienced a loss of 307,000
    inhabitants, or 1.6% of the total population over the study period due to temperature
    changes.
  32: The estimated effect of temperature on city size for cities with high trade
    opportunities is close to zero. The estimated effect of temperature on city size
    for cities with low trade opportunities is large and significant at 1%.

    city population in the full sample.
  35: Table 8 shows regression results with coefficients for the relationship between
    agricultural year mean temperature and the natural log of total pasture and cropland.
    For example, the coefficient for agricultural year mean temperature (years t-1
    to t-100) on Ln Total Cropland is 2.12***. Observations = 570, R^2 values are
    also reported.
