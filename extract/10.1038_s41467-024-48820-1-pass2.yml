Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate physical risk
  2: Climate-related hazards (acute risks like hurricanes) and long-run climate impacts
    (chronic risks).
  3: Climate physical risks (acute and chronic, including tropical cyclones), Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate scenarios (Representative Concentration
    Pathways (RCP) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP)), location of firm's production
    plants.
  4: Tropical cyclones, climate impact scenarios (SSP-RCP combinations), acute (RP250
    losses on assets) and chronic climate shocks on firms' long-run growth rate.
  5: Tropical cyclones, acute and chronic physical risks, neglecting asset-level information,
    using proxy data instead of asset-level data.
  9: Tropical cyclones (hurricanes) are the primary climate shock modeled, focusing
    on wind speed.
  10: Climate change physical risks, specifically chronic risks impacting output trajectories
    of business lines and acute risks (tropical cyclones) impacting assets.
  11: Tropical cyclones (acute physical risk) and chronic risks.
  12: Tropical cyclones impacting asset types, mostly energy-related, in Mexico.
  13: "Interplay of banks\u2019 lending and government's policy in the shock recovery."
Highlights:
  1: Asset-level assessment of climate physical risk matters for adaptation finance
  2: Neglecting the asset-level and acute dimensions of physical risks leads to large
    errors in the identification of adaptation policy responses, investments, and
    finance tools aimed to build resilience to climate change.
  3: Approximating firm locations with headquarters underestimates climate-related
    losses. Ignoring acute risks leads to underestimation of financial losses. Model
    provides a scenario-contingent financial valuation of firms accounting for both
    historical information and future climate scenarios.
  4: Chronic and acute shocks both contribute to higher equity shocks; Firms in the
    same sector can have different acute shocks based on asset locations; Substantial
    underestimation of investors' losses from neglecting tail acute risks.
  5: Asset-level information is key for climate physical risk assessment. Neglecting
    tail acute risks and asset-level data leads to large underestimations of portfolio
    losses.
  9: The research quantifies the macroeconomic impacts of tropical cyclones on Mexico,
    using the ICES model, under different climate scenarios and time horizons.
  10: Climate change physical risks are not accounted for in current valuations and
    will mostly impact the long-run part of the valuation. The model adjusts the long-run
    growth rate of dividends to reflect the heterogeneous impact of climate change
    on firms. The results are considered conservative due to the complexity of asset-level
    data, the compensation coming from positive macroeconomic shocks, and the consideration
    of only tropical cyclones.
  11: Equity value computed using EAI represents an average equity value from the
    distribution of possible values considering physical risks. Equity value computed
    using RP250 represents a percentile, or a VaR, of the distribution of possible
    equity values considering physical risks.
  13: Compounding risks of COVID-19 and climate change on macro-fiscal factors is
    important.
Methodology:
  1: Asset-level assessment of climate physical risk
  2: Asset-level climate physical risk assessment that translates the impact of both
    acute and chronic risk on the financial value of firms with productive assets
    exposed to climate impacts, and on financial securities (equity) associated with
    those firms.
  3: 'A five-step methodology is used: 1) database model for asset-level, business
    lines, ownership chain, and financial information; 2) probabilistic climate acute
    risk assessment at the asset level using the CLIMADA model; 3) connecting acute
    impacts with sector-level chronic impacts using a macroeconomic model (Intertemporal
    Computable Equilibrium System (ICES) model); 4) connecting asset-level impacts
    with the performance of the firm, and translating them into an adjustment of the
    financial valuation of the securities issued by the firm by developing a Climate
    Dividend Discount Model (CDDM); 5) translating climate physical risks into financial
    risk metrics for the investor.'
  4: Asset-level probabilistic risk assessment for tropical cyclones; macroeconomic
    impacts using the Intertemporal Computable Equilibrium System (ICES) macroeconomic
    model; 3-stage Climate Dividend Discount Model (CDDM) for climate-adjusted stock
    valuation; bootstrapping over 15,000 samples.
  5: Equity valuation adjustments using asset-level data compared to using firms'
    headquarters as proxy. Comparison of portfolio losses computed using asset-level
    data vs proxy data.  Consideration of acute and chronic physical risk scenarios.
  9: The study uses the ICES model to quantify macroeconomic impacts of climate change,
    specifically chronic risks. Hurricane tracks are simulated based on historical
    data and perturbed for future climate change impacts using CLIMADA. A Climate
    Dividend Discount Model (CDDM) is used to assess climate physical risk adjustments
    on equity valuation.
  10: 'A dividend discount model (DDM) is used to value equity, incorporating climate
    change impacts into the long-run growth rate of dividends. The model has three
    stages: explicit dividend estimation, linear decline modeling, and terminal value
    estimation. Climate change impacts are incorporated through the adjustment of
    the long-run growth rate (gL) based on sector-specific output trajectories under
    climate change scenarios and asset-level damage from tropical cyclones. This work
    considers the impact of climate change on equity valuations and can inform investment
    decisions.'
  11: Computes a Climate-Discounted Dividend Model (CDDM) conditioned on scenarios
    SSP2-RCP6.0, SSP3-RCP2.6, SSP3-RCP4.5, SSP5-RCP4.5, and taking into account climate
    impacts from 2035 onward. Uses 2040 as a reference year for climate impacts. Compares
    portfolio-level results using asset-level data versus proxy data (one location
    per firm).
  12: Analysis focused on direct impacts of tropical cyclones on a specific asset
    class, relying on interpolation and existing literature.
  13: Uses global CGE framework, interaction between COVID-19 and climate risks discussed,
    and the analysis involves a macroeconomic model from the ICES project.
More Notes:
  1: Published in Nature Communications, 15:5371
  2: The methodology is applied to a sample of 177 listed firms, owning 1820 physical
    assets located in Mexico.
  3: The analysis focuses on firms in Mexico and considers both acute (tropical cyclones)
    and chronic climate risks. The term 'assets' refers to facilities such as mines,
    power plants, and cement factories operated by a firm.
  4: Analysis considers both chronic and acute physical risks and their impact on
    firm-level equity losses and portfolio losses; Results are conditioned to climate
    scenario SSP3-RCP4.5.
  5: "The magnitude of financial shocks from climate physical risks can crucially\
    \ depend on the geolocation of firms\u2019 assets and on their business lines."
  9: The damage function used considers only wind speed, which is a limitation. The
    ICES model is used with assumptions of high climate change impacts and high capital
    mobility.
  10: The discount rate is assumed constant across firms and periods. The model simplifies
    asset-level risk assessment by using sector-specific trajectories, and risk is
    considered at the business line level. A firm cannot benefit from having physical
    assets less exposed to climate risk.
  11: The impact of acute shocks on the firm is captured in a reduced form as an adjustment
    in the growth rate of the firm. Consistent with macroeconomic model ICES, which
    represents climate change impacts as changes in productivity or losses on physical
    capital and land.
  13: Methodology and context involve a global framework that considers international
    trade and policy interactions.

    climate change impacts (~V0,I,j).
  11: Equity valuation of firms, measured as average equity value and Value at Risk
    (VaR) considering physical risks.
  13: The page references macro-fiscal implications of adaptation to climate change
    as outlined in an IMF Staff Climate Note.
Outcomes of Interest:
  12: Financial risk for investors is assessed conservatively, focusing on equities
    due to limited consideration of broader impacts.
Quantitative material:
  2: "Investor losses are underestimated up to 70% when neglecting asset-level information,\
    \ and up to 82% when neglecting tail acute risks; adaptation finance has increased\
    \ from 30 billion (annual) USD to 46 billion in the period 2017\u2013 2020; adaptation\
    \ finance needs are estimated to amount to 250 billion USD per year for low-income\
    \ and emerging countries alone by 2030."
  3: Approximation of firm's economic activity using headquarter location leads to
    underestimation of climate-related losses of up to 70% in terms of relative difference
    on Value at Risk (VaR) compared to granular asset-level data. Neglecting the component
    of acute risk can lead to underestimation of financial losses for investors up
    to about 82% in terms of relative difference on VaR. Tail risk losses (RP100)
    are at least ten times larger than EAI for 37% of assets. For about 73% of assets,
    RP250 losses are at least ten times larger than EAI. For 13% of assets, RP250
    losses are five times larger than RP100.
  4: VaR is between 5 and 38 times the mean loss; neglecting tail acute risk leads
    to an underestimation of losses up to 82.2%.
  5: Neglecting tail acute risks leads to underestimation of portfolio losses up to
    82.2%. Using proxy data instead of asset-level information leads to a relative
    underestimation of the VaR of the investor up to 70.8%. Magnitude of VaR is 3
    to 5.5 times larger when computed using asset-level data. Neglecting asset-level
    data leads to an underestimation of portfolio VaR between 67.4% and 92.3% when
    not considering chronic risks, and between 58.0% and 70.8% when considering chronic
    risks.
  9: Expected Annual Impacts (EAI) and 250 years Return Period (RP250) are used as
    measures of damages. These are combined with macro-economic impacts using the
    ICES model to quantify GDP impacts under different RCP/SSP scenarios (SSP2-RCP6.0,
    SSP3-RCP2.6, SSP3-RCP4.5, SSP5-RCP4.5) for the years 2035, 2040, 2045, and 2050.
  10: Formulas provided for calculating equity value (V0) and adjusted equity value
    (~V0,I,j) based on dividends, earnings per share, growth rates, discount rates,
    and climate change impacts on assets and business lines.
  11: Uses Expected Annual Impact (EAI) and 99.6th quantile (RP250) of tropical cyclone
    impacts as quantiles.
