Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature, moisture, and atmospheric CO2 concentration are drivers. Also, hydroclimatic
    variability impacting growth and rapid rise of summer temperature.
  2: Climate change, specifically increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations
  5: Unpredictable wildfires, insect population outbreaks, and other disturbances
    may yield counterbalancing effects on overall net carbon sequestration in boreal
    forests. Climate variations, specifically negative sensitivity to summer temperature
    (warmer summers leading to less growth) and positive sensitivity to summer soil
    moisture (more moisture leading to more growth), drive annual growth variability.
Highlights:
  1: No consistent boreal-wide growth response over the past 60 years across Canada.
    Southwestern and southeastern forests experienced a growth enhancement, while
    northwestern and maritime areas experienced a growth depression. An enhanced dependence
    of forest growth on soil moisture during the late-20th century is observed.
  2: Forest growth trends vary significantly across different regions and species
    of the Canadian boreal forest. While temperatures and CO2 have increased, overall
    growth across the boreal forest did not significantly change from 1950 to 2002.
    Declines in growth were observed in some regions (northwestern forests, Atlantic
    Maritime), while increases were seen in others (southeastern forests of the Boreal
    Shield).
Methodology:
  1: The study uses 873 newly developed tree-ring chronologies from Canada's National
    Forest Inventory from 1950 to the present.
  2: Analysis of tree-ring width measurements from 2,807 trees at 598 ground plots
    across Canada's National Forest Inventory (NFI) to assess aboveground growth responses
    of the Canadian boreal forest to climate change over the past ~60 years. Comparison
    with NDVI datasets and relating to seasonal temperature, soil moisture, and atmospheric
    carbon dioxide concentration. Use of GAMMNFI and GNE procedures to generate tree
    growth indices.
  5: Tree-ring width data from Canada's NFI plot survey were analyzed to estimate
    annual tree basal area increment (BAI). BAI data were then correlated with climatic
    variables (temperature, precipitation, soil moisture), atmospheric CO2, and remote-sensing
    NDVI data.  NDVI data was based on AVHRR raw data from the GIMMS dataset.
More Notes:
  1: "The study investigates species-specific spatiotemporal variability in terrestrial\
    \ aboveground biomass stem growth across Canada\u2019s boreal forests. Discrepancies\
    \ exist between remote sensing estimates and ground-based observations of forest\
    \ growth trends."
  2: The study highlights the complexity of forest response to climate change, with
    compensating positive and negative growth trends across wide regions. Discrepancies
    between tree-ring data and NDVI trends in some regions may point to artifacts
    in NDVI or other ecosystem processes not captured by tree growth estimates.
  5: The study cautions that mortality and disturbance impacts are not directly addressed,
    so extrapolation of future carbon is limited. There are disagreements between
    forest growth trajectories and remotely sensed NDVI trends.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No strong overall trend in forest growth when averaged across the Canadian boreal
    forest.
  2: No relevant information
  5: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: Circumpolar boreal forests are estimated to store ~53.9 Pg of carbon or ~14%
    of terrestrial vegetation biomass.
  2: "Declines in forest growth from 1982 to 2002 occurred in northwestern forests\
    \ east of the Rocky Mountains (up to -0.8%\xB7y\u22121) and also in the Atlantic\
    \ Maritime area (up to -0.6%\xB7y\u22121)."
  5: The correlation between residuals of mixed models (BAI variance unexplained by
    biological and climatic effects) and atmospheric [CO2] is r = 0.42. Mean correlation
    in Fig 4A is 0.16 and in 4B, it is 0.29.
