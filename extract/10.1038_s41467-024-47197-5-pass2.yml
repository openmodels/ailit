Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change leading to increasing heat exposures; population aging; biological
    and socioeconomic drivers of vulnerability to high temperatures
  2: The paper discusses ambient temperature distributions and exposure to high average
    temperatures as key drivers impacting elderly populations.
  3: Climate change leading to increased frequency and intensity of hot days and changes
    in demographic structures, especially aging populations.
  4: Key factors influencing future climate-related health risks include population
    growth, changes in age structure, and heat exposure.
  5: Climate change impacts on temperature exposure, particularly heat exposure in
    older adults, are identified as a key driver of risk.
  7: Climate change, population growth, and aging populations are identified as drivers
    of heat exposure.
  8: The paper discusses risks like the enhancement of the urban heat island effect
    and the vulnerability of older adults to heat extremes due to chronic health conditions
    and other factors.
  9: "The drivers of risk are meteorological indicators that vary by SSP scenario:\
    \ cooling degree days (CDD), 20-year average 95th percentile of daily maximum\
    \ temperatures (TMax95th), and 20-year average count of days with a dry bulb maximum\
    \ temperature of 37.5\xB0C (#HD)."
  10: The risk driver considered is population exposure to heat, with a focus on climate
    change-driven increases in heat.

Evaluation overview:
  1: Heat exposure of older adults
  2: The paper provides an overview of heat exposures and health impacts on elderly
    populations, focusing on chronic and acute heat exposure risks.
  3: The paper projects changes in heat exposure risks for populations, particularly
    the elderly, evaluating increases in heat days and high-temperature exposure.
  4: The analysis focuses on the heat exposure of individuals aged 69 and older, evaluating
    impacts such as increased exposure to cooling degree days, number of hot days,
    and acute extreme heat exposure.
  5: The article assesses acute exposure to climate-related stressors, focusing on
    temperature-related risks for different age groups and regions.

    (PHDs), and Billion Person Degrees (PD95th).
  8: The document highlights the evaluation of the impact of demographic changes on
    the vulnerability of older adults to heat extremes.
  9: "The study focuses on population heat exposures, using cooling degree days (CDD)\
    \ as a measure of chronic heat exposure, the 20-year average 95th percentile of\
    \ daily maximum temperatures (TMax95th) as a measure of acute heat extreme intensity,\
    \ and the 20-year average count of days with a dry bulb maximum temperature of\
    \ 37.5\xB0C (#HD) as a measure of acute \"extreme hot days\" exposure."
  10: This paper evaluates the accuracy of age-stratified population projections,
    specifically focusing on the population aged 69 and older.
  13: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: Chronic heat exposure is projected to double by mid-century; a significant increase
    in the number of older adults exposed to dangerous heat, particularly in Asia
    and Africa, where adaptive capacity is lower.
  2: The paper highlights the intersection of aging populations and heat exposure
    risks under current and mid-century climate projections.
  3: "Significant growth in heat exposure for populations aged 69+, particularly in\
    \ Asia, with a more than threefold increase in people living in climates with\
    \ TMAX95 > 37.5\xB0C."
  4: Growing acute heat exposure is highlighted as a cause for concern, particularly
    for older individuals, implying increased demand for thermal regulation with associated
    economic and health costs.
  5: In temperate nations like Europe and North America, climate change will be the
    prevailing mechanism of increased heat exposure, while population aging will be
    the key driver in warmer regions.
  7: Aging populations and rising heat exposures will likely lead to considerable
    demands on social and health services, requiring novel policy interventions.
  8: Emphasizes the need for adaptation solutions to consider the distinctive needs
    of large and rapidly growing populations of older adults.
  9: The projected elderly population in 2050 for the United States closely aligns
    with estimates from ref. 77 but has more bias in relation to ref. 78. For the
    European Union and the United Kingdom, SSP3 projections are similar to previous
    estimates from ref. 79 and ref. 81, while other SSPs diverge more. China shows
    a more significant absolute difference across scenarios, but moderate percentage
    errors given the large population size. India shows relatively good consistency
    for SSP2.
  10: The analysis decomposes exposure change into contributions from population,
    age structure, and meteorology at a regional level. It examines the accuracy of
    population projections under different SSP scenarios and geographic areas.
  13: No relevant information
Methodology:
  1: Combines age-stratified demographic projections with downscaled temperature projections
    to mid-century.
  2: The analysis is performed using global gridded age-stratified demographic projections
    and temperature projections from CMIP6 models, considering different socio-economic
    scenarios.
  3: Analysis uses projections under SSP-RCP scenarios integrating climate models
    (CMIP6 GCMs) to evaluate future heat exposure related to demographic changes up
    to 2050.
  7: Decomposes projected determinants of exposure by region and globally under different
    SSP scenarios. Results are applicable to understanding future heat exposure based
    on modeled climate and socioeconomic scenarios.
  8: Analysis uses demographic input data sources and age-stratified population projections,
    along with climate models, to understand future impacts and develop potential
    adaptation strategies.
  9: The study downscales demographic projections to 2050 and compares them with existing
    projections at a sub-national spatial resolution. It compares 2020 counts of individuals
    aged >69 obtained with a global method to regional projections from other studies
    for the United States, European Union, India, the United Kingdom, and China. The
    downscaling uses population growth factors by age-stratum, grid cell, and scenario,
    imputing unknown growth factors. The calculations for heat exposure metrics apply
    to current and future climate epochs/SSP scenarios.
  10: The analysis uses a grid-cell-based approach to decompose the fractional change
    in regional-scale exposure into contributions from age structure, population size,
    and meteorology. Equations (7a, 7b, 7c) define population hot days frequency (PHD),
    which includes acute (intensity and frequency) and chronic/cumulative changes.
    The equations and methodology are applicable for estimating and decomposing the
    impacts of climate change on older populations.
  13: The paper uses climate data processed by I.S.W. and experiments conducted by
    G.F. to generate figures and analyze results.
More Notes:
  1: Focuses on the intersection of population aging and climate change, highlighting
    the emergence of vulnerable hotspots.
  3: The analysis emphasizes regional differences, noting larger increases in heat
    exposure in regions like Africa and Asia compared to Europe and North America.
  7: The coming decade is critical for addressing both climate change and healthy
    aging agendas. Integrating adaptation planning and healthcare directives is needed
    to minimize heat's direct morbidity and mortality impacts.
  9: The paper uses Absolute Percentage Error (APE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error
    (MAPE) to evaluate the difference between the data sources. The study acknowledges
    that the EU projections are not based on any specific SSP, so discrepancies may
    be due to different underlying scenario assumptions.
  10: The paper uses data from WorldPop, indicating a reliance on existing gridded
    population data. The metrics in the table are error measurements of age-stratified
    population projections, not necessarily direct climate impacts. The analysis develops
    equations to express climate exposures that consider population, meteorology and
    population age-structure.
