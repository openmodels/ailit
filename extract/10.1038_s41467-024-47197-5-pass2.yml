  10: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increasing heat exposure due to climate change, global population aging
  3: Increasing frequency and intensity of acute heat exposure, with elevated projected
    heat stress in specific regions and among aging populations.
  4: Population growth and age structure changes, particularly an increase in the
    population aged 69+ and their exposure to heat-related climate risks.
  5: Climate change impacts (specifically, increasing temperatures and heat exposure).
    Population aging, particularly in specific regions.
  7: Climate change, Population growth, Aging, and Historical trends are identified
    as drivers of heat exposure.
  8: Increased heat exposure, particularly for older adults (69+), due to climate
    change (urban heat island effect) and demographic shifts (aging populations).
  10: Changes in age structure, population size, and climate change-driven increases
    in heat.
Highlights:
  1: Chronic exposure to heat doubles across all warming scenarios
  3: Projections show significant increase in heat exposure for older populations
    globally, particularly in Asia and Africa.
  4: Large increase in heat exposure, especially for older individuals, with potentially
    great private and social costs for energy use and health repercussions due to
    increased demand for indoor thermal regulation.
  5: Cumulative heat exposure of older individuals (PDDs) will at least triplicate
    in all continents by 2050, irrespective of the scenario. Asia will experience
    the highest levels of older adult heat exposure. Africa will see the largest impact
    from total population growth on overall heat exposure.
  7: The study decomposes the drivers of projected heat exposure by region and globally,
    highlighting the contributions of climate change, population growth, aging, and
    historical trends under different SSP scenarios.
  8: Provides age-stratified gridded population projections for 2050 under different
    SSP scenarios, which can be used for health-related assessments and adaptation
    planning. Focuses on the vulnerability of older adults (69+) to heat extremes.
Methodology:
  1: combine age-stratified demographic projections with downscaled temperature projections
    to mid-century
  5: GCM (General Circulation Model) projections are used to estimate future heat
    exposure under different SSPs (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways). Analysis is performed
    at both regional and country levels. Projections cover the period from 2020 to
    2050.
  7: Decomposition analysis of projected determinants of heat exposure.
  8: Downscales global population projections to a 1km grid for the year 2050 by age
    and SSP scenario using WorldPop data. The analysis uses R (terra, raster, sf,
    and tidyverse packages).
  10: The analysis uses grid cells as the fundamental unit and decomposes exposure
    change into contributions of population, age structure, and meteorology. Equations
    (7a), (7b), (7c), (8), (9), (10), and (11) describe the calculations of population
    exposure and decomposition of exposure change. The models use SSP1, SSP2, SSP3,
    and SSP5 scenarios.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the impact of heat exposure on older adults, particularly
    in Asia and Africa, which have the lowest adaptive capacity.
  5: "The paper focuses on the distribution of heat exposure across different age\
    \ groups and regions, highlighting the differential impacts of climate change\
    \ and demographic shifts. SI Appendix contains additional results at the country\
    \ level (Figs. SI-23\u2013SI-37) and for different SSP scenarios (Figs. SI-19\u2013\
    SI-21). The paper does not explicitly model macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes."
  7: The paper suggests that areas with aging populations and rising heat exposures
    will face considerable demands for social and health services.
  8: The paper acknowledges limitations related to the uncertainty of future population
    projections and the potential for autonomous adaptation (e.g., private actions
    like purchasing air conditioners or community-level investments in cooling interventions).
    Mentions that climate-induced migration may have direct impacts on demographic
    change.
  10: The analysis focuses on the population aged 69+ and their exposure to heat under
    different climate scenarios. The NUTS3 areas are a geographical subdivision used
    in the EU.

  5: No relevant information
  7: Billion Person Degrees (PD95th), Billion Person Degree Days (PDDs), Billion Person
    Hot Days (PHDs) are used to quantify exposure to heat.

Quantitative material:
  1: ">23% of the global population aged 69+ will inhabit climates whose 95th percentile\
    \ of daily maximum temperature exceeds the critical threshold of 37.5 \xB0C, compared\
    \ with 14% today, exposing an additional 177\u2013246 million older adults to\
    \ dangerous acute heat."
  3: "Projected increase in population aged 69+ exposed to high heat: 0.16\u20130.23\
    \ billion for hot days metric, 0.18\u20130.25 billion for TMAX95, and 0.23\u2013\
    0.32 billion for CDDs, depending on scenario."
  5: "The paper quantifies exposure in terms of number of individuals exposed to given\
    \ CDD (Cooling Degree Days) exposure levels, number of individuals exposed to\
    \ a given number of annual Days with TMAX95 > 37.5 \xB0C, and Cumulative heat\
    \ exposure of older individuals (Person Degree Days or PDDs)."
  7: Provides quantitative decompositions of PDDs, PHDs, and PD95th by region (Africa,
    Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South America) and globally under different
    SSP scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585).
