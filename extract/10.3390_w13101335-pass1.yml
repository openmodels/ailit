Drivers of Risk:
  1: Projected changes in mean temperatures, precipitations, droughts, and floods
    under various RCPs affecting regions in Italy.
  5: 'Climate change, specifically increases in seasonal mean temperature, driven
    by different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP 2.6 (mitigation),
    RCP 4.5 (partial mitigation), and RCP 8.5 (no mitigation).'
  10: Changes in seasonal climate conditions (specifically, changes in the number
    of days with certain climatic conditions) driven by different RCP scenarios (2.6,
    4.5, and 8.5), with a focus on temperature or precipitation anomalies in Italy.
  14: Changes in temperature and precipitation; greenhouse gas emission scenarios
    (RCP 8.5, RCP 4.5, and RCP 2.6); anthropogenic radiative forcing.
Highlights:
  1: Without mitigation (RCP 8.5), drought conditions and extreme precipitations are
    expected to intensify in Italy, becoming less critical with partial (RCP 4.5)
    or full mitigation actions (RCP 2.6).
  5: Significant temperature increases are expected everywhere. The magnitude of warming
    depends on the emission scenario (RCP) and the time horizon. The Alpine region
    is particularly vulnerable to warming in winter.
  10: The maps project seasonal climate anomalies in Italy under different RCP scenarios,
    showing the spatial distribution of changes in the number of days with certain
    climate conditions (likely temperature or precipitation).
  14: Warming is projected, with intensity depending on orography and greenhouse gas
    emission scenarios; Complex patterns of change are discovered at the local level,
    with areas of increasing and decreasing precipitation; Climate extremes will be
    much less critical if mitigation actions are undertaken.
Methodology:
  1: "Analysis based on a high-resolution model set (Euro-CORDEX) using horizontal\
    \ resolution of 0.11\xB0 to project climate scenarios for different RCPs and timeframes."
  5: The analysis uses Euro-CORDEX simulations and compares them with E-OBS and MESAN
    data for precipitation patterns (1971-2000 baseline). Temperature anomalies are
    calculated as differences between future climate values and reference values in
    four seasons (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test is applied to determine
    if changes are statistically significant.
  10: Climate anomaly maps are generated by comparing projected climate conditions
    (2021-2050 and 2041-2070) under different RCP scenarios to a reference period
    (1971-2000).
  14: Analysis of 11 high-resolution Euro-CORDEX models to characterize precipitation
    regime over Italy under RCP 8.5, RCP 4.5, and RCP 2.6 scenarios. The study uses
    climate extreme indices CDD and R99PTOT to describe drought conditions and extreme
    precipitation, respectively. Results are applicable to climate change projections
    over Italy.
More Notes:
  5: The page focuses primarily on temperature projections and associated uncertainties.
    It does not directly address macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, or the costs and
    benefits of adaptation strategies.  The stippling indicates statistically significant
    changes. Short-term, medium-term, and long-term refer to coming decades, middle
    of the century, and last thirty-year scenario respectively.
  10: The specific climate variable being analyzed (temperature or precipitation)
    is not explicitly stated, but it is related to Cooling Degree Days (CDD).
  14: "Con\uFB01dence in climate change projections varies by region and by climate\
    \ variable; The study focuses on local trends in the different Italian regions;\
    \ The availability of climate data does not automatically translate into usability,\
    \ as the uncertainty of regional climate changes projections is still large and\
    \ has to be accounted for."

Quantitative material:
  5: "Temperature increase projections are given in degrees Celsius (\xB0C) for different\
    \ RCPs and time horizons (short-, medium-, and long-term, with respect to the\
    \ baseline period 1971\u20132000).  Examples: RCP2.6 limited to within 1\xB0C\
    \ (short-term); RCP8.5 may be more than 5\xB0C (long-term)."
  10: The maps quantify changes in climate conditions in 'number of days', with a
    scale ranging from -10 to +30 days.
  14: "Temperatures are likely to increase from an additional 1\xB0C (RCP2.6) to about\
    \ 4\u20135\xB0C (RCP 8.5) with respect to the base-line period (1971\u20132000)\
    \ by the late 21st century; Total precipitation in winter over North Italy could\
    \ increase from 5% to 30% over the century; Total precipitation in summer could\
    \ decrease by about 5\u201310% up to 50%, respectively, in the short-, medium-\
    \ and long-term in RCP8.5 and RCP 4.5; Coastlines will be affected by an increase\
    \ of one or two more extreme precipitation events during the winter and autumn\
    \ under partial or no mitigation; The maximum length of dry spell is expected\
    \ to grow until 10\u201315 days during the summer in Southern Italy under RCP4.5\
    \ and RCP8.5."
