Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increasing peak electricity load caused by rising temperatures.
  3: Annual maximum temperature in provinces.
  4: Increase in maximum temperature leads to increased peak load demand by 0.385
    GW on average, with additional contributory factors being population growth, urbanization,
    and economic output.
  5: Temperature changes impact peak electricity load differently across China's regions.
  6: Climate change (maximum temperature increases), socioeconomic variables (population,
    urbanization rate, the economic share of secondary industry and GDP)
  7: Increased temperature due to climate change, socioeconomic factors (population
    growth, urbanization, total factor productivity, economic development), penetration
    of air conditioners.
  8: Climate change impacts on peak electricity load, climate variables, socioeconomic
    variables
Highlights:
  1: "Significant positive correlation between provincial highest temperatures and\
    \ peak loads; Eastern China region most affected; nationwide effect requires additional\
    \ infrastructure investment of 275\u2013617 billion yuan per year by end of century."
  3: The study uses a panel data of 31 provinces from 1998 to 2018 to estimate the
    response functions of peak loads to maximum temperatures.
  4: Temperature rises significantly impact peak electricity load, proving robust
    across different models and comparative analysis with other regions.
  5: Eastern China, with higher economic development, exhibits significant increases
    in peak load due to temperature rise, necessitating more attention for coping
    with climate-induced peak load impacts.
  6: Socioeconomic variables have larger impacts on the peak load than the temperatures.
  7: Climate change and socioeconomic factors significantly impact peak load demand.
    Air conditioner usage is a significant channel for peak load response to climate
    change. Eastern China Region will still have the highest peak load.
  8: Peak load in China is projected to grow significantly by 2100 under all scenarios,
    with significantly higher growth when socioeconomic variables are included in
    the model.
Methodology:
  1: Estimates response functions of annual peak loads to maximum temperatures in
    China under different scenarios.
  3: A two-way fixed effect panel data model is used to investigate the response functions
    of peak load to changes of maximum temperature, using a linear model; stepwise
    regression is adopted to estimate the regression model.
  4: Uses a Two-way Fixed Effects model with data from 1998 to 2018 for assessing
    temperature-related peak load responses, with robustness checks through Instrumental
    Variables (IV) method for endogeneity concerns.
  5: Load-temperature responses for three regions in China are analyzed using regression
    models; the focus is on the mediating effects of total air conditioner ownership.
  6: Forecasts peak load and required infrastructure investment in the future under
    different scenarios (SSP-RCP). Uses estimated temperature-load response functions.
    Considers wind and solar generators for infrastructure investment estimation.
  7: Estimated load-temperature response functions were used to project national peak
    load under different SSP-RCP scenarios.
  8: Peak load forecasting to 2100 under different SSP-RCP scenarios; includes models
    with only climate variables and models that include climate and socioeconomic
    variables.
More Notes:
  3: The study acknowledges that the response functions of electricity consumption
    to climate change exhibit asymmetric U-shaped curves, but uses a linear model
    for estimation. Control variables include total population, provincial GDP, the
    proportion of the secondary industry, and the urbanization rate.
  4: The study emphasizes the regional differences in responses to temperature changes,
    suggesting heterogeneity in economic impacts across regions.
  7: The study suggests integrating climate change into long-term power system planning,
    promoting energy efficiency in air conditioners, developing demand response programs,
    and utilizing electricity markets for optimal investment and planning. The study
    acknowledges limitations related to policy shocks, spatial granularity of data,
    and endogeneity issues.
  8: Includes a figure showing provincial peak load forecasts for 2030, 2050, and
    2100.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Annual peak load of electricity in provinces.
  4: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes directly discussed, primarily focused
    on power load dynamics in response to temperature changes.
  6: Additional investment demand for electricity supply infrastructure
  7: No relevant information
  8: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: "Increase of the highest temperature by 1\xB0C will, on average, rise the peak\
    \ load by 0.385 GW; national peak load predicted to reach between 3807 GW and\
    \ 6815 GW by end of century."
  3: The R2 of Model (4) is the highest (0.943) among all the four regression results
    when assessing impacts of temperature on peak load.
  4: "An increase in temperature by 1\xB0C increases the peak load by 0.385 GW, which\
    \ is a 2.33% increase compared to the historical average peak load."
  5: "A 1\xB0C rise in maximum temperature leads to a 0.708 GW increase in peak load\
    \ in Eastern China, 0.116 GW increase in Central China, and an insignificant effect\
    \ in Western China."
  6: Annual investment will range from 298 to 617 billion yuan for wind generators,
    and from 275 to 570 billion yuan for solar generators
  7: National peak load is expected to reach between 3807 GW and 6815 GW in 2100 under
    different climate and socio-economic scenarios. Impacts of temperature rise can
    contribute to 20% of the peak load increase. Load from air conditioners can account
    for as large as 50% of the peak load during hot summers.
  8: Peak load growth rates under different SSP-RCP scenarios for China (37% to 41%
    with climate variables included; 365% to 580% with climate and socioeconomic variables
    included)
