Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, population growth, and upstream land use changes increase the
    risk of water shortage due to droughts.
  2: Drought-induced water shortage impacting agriculture, shipping, industry, and
    drinking water sectors, also salt water intrusion due to low river flows.
  3: Drought hazard, specifically measured by cumulative precipitation deficit during
    the growing season (April to September), influenced by potential evapotranspiration
    and precipitation. Coinciding periods of low river flows in the Rhine and Meuse
    rivers. Changed water demand.
  4: Droughts, leading to water shortage, impacting agriculture, inland water transport,
    drinking water production and industry.
  6: Climate change scenarios including changes in temperature, sea level rise, precipitation,
    and evapotranspiration are considered as drivers of drought risk. Socio-economic
    factors like population and economic growth also contribute to the overall risk.
  7: A warmer climate leading to changes in precipitation and reference evapotranspiration,
    particularly during the growing season (April-September), impacting drought frequency
    and intensity.
  8: Increased drought and related saltwater intrusion, particularly affecting agriculture
    and other sectors.
  9: Drought, climate scenarios (GI2050, Wh2050), and continuing current policy.
  10: Drought and water shortages impacting various sectors are identified as key
    drivers of macroeconomic risk.
Highlights:
  1: "Presents a method to quantify drought risk in the Netherlands under changing\
    \ future conditions and in response to policy actions to support decision making\
    \ on the Netherlands\u2019 national drought risk management strategy."
  2: The integrated drought risk assessment framework is used to inform adaptation
    decisions and allocation of funds for drought risk mitigation in the Netherlands.
  3: Drought risk assessment framework combines drought probability, physical impacts,
    and societal cost-benefit analysis to inform adaptive strategy planning.
  4: The paper focuses on quantifying the national welfare effects of droughts in
    the Netherlands, considering impacts on agriculture, inland water transport, drinking
    water, and industry.
  6: Policy actions are evaluated based on the balance between avoided drought risk
    and the associated costs, from a societal welfare perspective.
  7: The current drought risk in the Netherlands is estimated at EUR372 million per
    year and may increase to 611 million until 2050 according to the worst-case scenario.
  8: Advises a phased strategy including certain policy actions deemed cost-effective
    or conditionally advantageous, such as N-2 and N-3, and delays others like N-1
    and S-1.
  9: "Drought risk is projected to increase significantly under the Stoom2050 scenario\
    \ (increased cumulative precipitation deficit and low river flows duration), with\
    \ total drought risk in the Netherlands rising from \u20AC372 million to \u20AC\
    611 million per year."
  10: The adjustment of river water distribution reduces costs in the drinking water
    sector but increases drought risk for shipping.
Methodology:
  1: Quantify drought risks, integrating drought probability and socio-economic consequences
    for all relevant sectors. Compare investment costs of policy actions with expected
    risk reduction in a societal cost-benefit analysis to build an adaptive long-term
    strategy.
  2: 'Presents an integrated drought risk assessment framework demonstrated on the
    Dutch Delta Programme. The framework consists of four steps: (1) analyzing drought
    probability using long time series of hydrological and meteorological variables,
    (2) simulating time series with a national hydrological model to obtain hydrological
    and human responses and estimating welfare effects of water shortage by coupling
    economic impact models for agriculture, shipping, industry, and drinking water
    with the hydrological model, (3) comparing the costs of proposed policy actions
    with the calculated change in drought risks, and (4) determining the opportune
    time to invest. An adaptive strategy is built by comparing the costs of policy
    actions with the change in drought risk and the opportune investment time. Finally,
    the evaluation based on societal costs and benefits supported the decision by
    the minister to allocate funds for drought risk mitigation.'
  3: The analysis uses a 100-year historic time series of precipitation and evaporation,
    hydrological models, and impact models to assess drought probability and physical
    impacts. Societal cost-benefit analysis is applied to evaluate policy actions.
    Future projections are based on transformed time series reflecting new hydrological
    conditions.
  4: Uses the National Water Model (NWM) to simulate droughts, AGRICOM model to propagate
    soil moisture deficits to crop yield reduction, economic tools to assess the impact
    of crop yield reduction and higher irrigation costs, and the BIVAS model for inland
    water transport impacts. Drought risk curves are used to determine the probability
    distribution of welfare effects.
  6: The study uses an integrated drought risk assessment framework involving climate
    change scenarios, hydrological modeling, and societal cost-benefit analysis. Stakeholders
    provide information on costs and benefits of policy actions. A transformation
    tool is used to project river discharge based on climate change scenarios. The
    equal annual annuity (EAA) method is used to compare measures with different lifespans
    and costs, using discount rates of 3%-4.5%.
  7: Model simulations are used to estimate drought risk, considering precipitation
    deficits and low-river-flow periods; Cost-benefit evaluation is conducted for
    policy actions, with interpolation between reference and Stoom scenarios to determine
    the opportune time to invest; Extrapolation is required beyond 2050, limited to
    100 years ahead in the analysis.
  8: A process-based, integrated drought risk assessment framework combining time-series
    analysis, hydrological models, impact models, and economic cost-benefit analysis.
  9: Integrated drought risk assessment using a dynamic simulation approach coupling
    impact models with a hydrological simulation model. Market price methods are used
    for agriculture and shipping. Avoided cost approach is used for drinking water
    and industry. Shadow price of water is used to monetize other effects.
  10: Dynamic simulation of drought risk, including quantitative evaluation of costs
    and benefits of adaptation strategies.
More Notes:
  1: A risk-based approach to support drought risk management is relatively new. The
    study focuses on quantifying meteorological or hydrological drought indicators
    and their impacts on specific user groups.
  3: The study area is the Netherlands, focusing on regions largely containing peat
    and clay soils.
  4: Some drought impacts like soil subsidence and biodiversity loss were monetized
    using a shadow price due to lack of specific impact models. Impacts outside the
    Netherlands are excluded from the national welfare analysis.
  6: The analysis is specific to the Netherlands, given the references to the Delta
    Programme, Rijkswaterstaat, salinized polder systems, and prescribed discount
    rates by the Dutch government.
  7: The opportune time to invest in policy actions is determined by the intersection
    of average avoided drought risk and annual costs.
  9: The analysis acknowledges the complexity of drought propagation to societal impact
    but is data- and computation-intensive. The paper recommends further improvement
    of impact calculation for drought-induced soil subsidence and incorporation of
    the impact on ecosystems and biodiversity.
  10: Uncertainties in model results are acknowledged, especially related to economic
    impact models and cost-benefit analysis.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Socio-economic consequences of drought, including direct effects such as crop
    losses and shipping delays; indirect effects on the economy as a whole, such as
    unemployment and price changes; and intangible effects such as deteriorated water
    quality and biodiversity loss.
  3: Societal costs and benefits of policy actions, including adaptation strategies
    in future scenarios, are considered.
  4: National welfare effects, measured as the change in consumer and producer surplus,
    and expected annual economic impact. Also looks at transport costs.
  6: Avoided drought risk is compared with the annual cost for each policy action
    to determine societal welfare. The analysis considers both monetized effects based
    on calculated change in drought risk and non-monetized effects provided by stakeholders.
  7: Drought risk in the Netherlands is estimated at EUR 372 million per year currently,
    potentially increasing to EUR 611 million by 2050 under the worst-case 'Stoom'
    scenario.
  8: The cost-benefit ratio, positive or negative, for various policy actions regarding
    drought risk adaptation is analyzed.
  9: Drought risk quantified in millions of euros per year for various sectors (agriculture,
    shipping, drinking water, industry) in the Netherlands and two specific regions
    (Southwest, North).
  10: "The analysis identifies avoided drought risk (measured in million \u20AC/year)\
    \ as an economic benefit of the adaptation strategies."
Quantitative material:
  1: Investment costs of proposed policy actions and strategies can be compared with
    the expected risk reduction to determine the cost-effectiveness.
  3: "Drought hazard is measured as the cumulative difference between potential evapotranspiration\
    \ and precipitation. Thresholds for low river flows are defined as 1000 m3s\u2212\
    1 for the Rhine and 50 m3s\u22121 for the Meuse with duration of 7 days or longer."
  4: Calculates annual crop yield reduction and irrigation costs. Calculates annual
    transport costs based on water levels. It also includes the costs of temporary
    storage of goods or transportation by other modalities.
  6: Table 1 provides quantitative scenario assumptions for climate change (temperature
    change, sea level rise, precipitation change, evapotranspiration change) and socio-economic
    change (population, economic growth, agricultural land use, nature/recreation
    area, urban area, irrigation area, water extraction, and water demand for flushing
    salinized polder systems).
  7: 'Current drought risk: EUR 372 million per year; Drought risk in 2050 (Stoom
    scenario): EUR 611 million per year; Drought risk in 2050 (Warm scenario): EUR
    607 million per year.'
  8: Estimated increase in drought risk costs for various sectors, including agriculture
    by EUR155 million, shipping by EUR72 million, drinking water supply by EUR9 million,
    and industrial risk by EUR3 million per year.
  9: Table 3 presents current and future drought risk in millions of euros per year.
    Figure 4 shows changes in meteorological and hydrological drought probability
    (cumulative precipitation deficit and duration of low flows).
  10: "Yes, the avoided drought risk is quantified in million \u20AC/year across different\
    \ sectors such as agriculture, shipping, and industry."
