Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change impacts on labor and capital productivity leading to firm bankruptcies
    and non-performing loans, and climate-related damages (floods, landslides, storm
    surges) threatening the financial system
  3: Climate change (temperature anomaly, cumulative emissions), labor productivity
    damages, capital stock damages, financial crises, non-performing loans.
  4: Climate change impacts on microeconomic behavior of firms and workers cause additional
    non-performing loans and threaten financial institution solvency.
  5: Climate change induced labour and capital damages; Financial distress; Temperature
    anomaly at 2100; Banks' allowance to lend
  6: Climate change, temperature increases, secondary systemic effects of banks' equity
    deterioration, firms' equity holding by banks, missing link between the energy
    industry and the banking system, contagion phenomena
  7: Climate change impacts leading to firm bankruptcies, financial system equity
    losses, and reduced credit supply.
  10: Climate impacts on the financial system
Highlights:
  2: Climate change will increase the frequency of banking crises and the fiscal burden
    of bailing out insolvent banks; Ignoring the financial system in climate-economy
    integrated assessments may underestimate climate impacts; Financial regulation
    can play a role in mitigating these impacts.
  3: Climate change significantly reduces economic growth and increases financial
    instability. Damages to labor productivity have a greater impact than damages
    to capital. Financial crises and bank bailouts are exacerbated by climate change,
    increasing public debt.
  4: Even with macroprudential regulation like Basel III, climate change impact on
    financial crises remains dominant.
  5: Climate change (labor and capital damages) can significantly impact GDP growth,
    potentially leading to lower growth rates and increased financial distress; Climate
    change can induce bank bailouts, leading to public costs that are sensitive to
    temperature anomalies and banks' allowance to lend.
  6: Climate damages reverberate to the financial system, inducing feedback loops
    that sharpen macroeconomic damages. Macroprudential policies are important for
    managing climate-induced financial risks. Both direct and indirect effects (linked
    to contagion phenomena) on the financial system need to be considered.
  7: Climate-induced financial instability can cause significant macroeconomic disruptions.
    Specifically, financial instability might necessitate government bailouts to prevent
    banking crises.
Methodology:
  2: Agent-based climate-macroeconomic model calibrated on stylized facts, future
    scenarios and climate impact functions affecting labour and capital; Monte Carlo
    analyses over 500 model runs; SSP5 central case; Sensitivity analysis around central
    values based on estimates from an earlier study.
  3: Monte Carlo simulation (size 500). Compares baseline (no climate change) with
    impact scenarios (labor productivity damages, capital stock damages, both). SSP1
    and SSP5 scenarios are also considered. An additional simulation experiments studies
    the effect of removing banks' equity and lending capacity to measure the contribution
    of climate-induced financial distress to the economy. Also there is an analysis
    of the effect of Basel-type capital requirements.
  4: Analysis uses simulations to model climate-induced effects on banking sector
    and public finances, with comparisons across different scenarios including a baseline.
  5: Climate economic modelling, including Monte Carlo simulations with parameter
    variations; Analysis of GDP growth rates over 25-year periods (2000-2099); Assessment
    of bank bailout costs under different climate scenarios
  6: Integrated assessment models of climate change should include a financial system
    and financial regulation authorities
  7: Performs Monte Carlo analyses over 500 model runs to evaluate variability and
    present average results.
  10: Agent based climate-economy integrated assessment model in SSP5 and SSP1 like
    scenarios
More Notes:
  2: "The paper focuses on the impact of climate change on the stability of the global\
    \ banking system and the public costs of rescuing insolvent banks; Macroprudential\
    \ regulation attenuates bailout costs, but only moderately; Historical records\
    \ suggest financial crises entail an average cost of around 35% of the gross domestic\
    \ product (GDP) of the countr y facing the event in terms of output lost and a\
    \ fiscal burden for the government of 13% of the countr y\u2019s GDP8."
  3: The study highlights the interconnectedness of climate impacts, financial stability,
    and economic growth. The results suggest a significant role for macroprudential
    regulation in climate risk management. The analysis considers both SSP1 and SSP5
    scenarios. Around 20% of growth rate reduction is attributable to financial distress.
  5: Analysis focuses on global GDP growth; Public costs of bank bailouts depend on
    Banks' allowance to lend which is measured as a multiplier of the Capital Adequacy
    Ratio (CAR) of banks.
  6: Suggests an optimal level of capital adequacy requirements for banks.
  7: Agent-based models are used to capture complex interactions neglected by top-down
    methods, particularly useful in studying climate change economics and finance.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: GDP effects, public debt to GDP ratio, fiscal burden (as % of GDP)
  3: GDP growth, firm insolvency likelihood, banks' equity-to-total asset ratio, public
    bailouts, cost of bailouts as % of GDP, average debt-to-GDP ratio.
  4: Historical average of financial crises was 3.5 per year globally, producing fiscal
    costs averaging 12% of GDP.
  5: Yearly GDP growth rate; Public costs of bank bailouts (% of GDP)
  6: Climate-induced financial risks, macroeconomic damages, bailout costs
  10: Public costs
Quantitative material:
  2: Banking crises frequency increase by 26-248%; Fiscal burden of rescuing insolvent
    banks of approximately 5-15% of GDP per year; Public debt to GDP ratio increases
    by a factor of 2; 20% of these effects are caused by the deterioration of banks'
    balance sheets induced by climate change.
  3: GDP growth reduction from 3.5% to 2.0-2.9% annually depending on the climate
    impact scenario. Firm insolvency likelihood increases from 15.2% to 32.4-38.8%.
    Public debt to GDP averages 250% in 2100 in SSP1. In an SSP5 world, average growth
    rates are between 91% and 48% of baseline for the first to fourth century quarters
    respectively. In SSP1, output growth contracts by 9%. The public costs of climate-induced
    bailouts increase approximately linearly with temperature anomaly.
