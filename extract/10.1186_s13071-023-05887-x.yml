Drivers of Risk:
  2: Burgeoning urbanization, climate change, and the urban heat island effect are
    likely to interact to favor invasive hematophagous arthropods and the diseases
    they can vector.
  3: Socioeconomic factors such as economic growth and international trade increasing
    the spread of alien species.
  7: Long distance transport and livestock trade facilitated tick translocations.
  8: Climate warming may foster hematophagous arthropod invasions by increasing favorable
    thermal niches.
  10: Climate change facilitates the poleward and elevational migrations of hematophagous
    arthropods, increasing the risk of disease spread.
  11: Climate change providing opportunity for new invasions and exacerbating current
    ones; urbanization and heat islands contributing to mosquito populations.
  12: Urbanization can be beneficial to Ae. albopictus but detrimental to Ae. japonicus
    and Ae. koreicus; urban heat island effect promotes rapid mosquito development
    and earlier seasonal population peaks; light pollution prolongs reproduction and
    biting seasons of Cx. pipiens; NPK fertilizers attract gravid female mosquitoes
    and enhance food biomass for larvae; insecticides favor the emergence of multiple
    lines of resistance among pests and mosquitoes.
  13: Climate change is predicted to further increase the worldwide invasion of hematophagous
    arthropods.
  14: Accelerated worldwide urbanization and interconnectivity, development of populations
    in human-made microhabitats, ecological niche shifts including niche inversion
    phenomenon.

  9: The spread and impact of hematophagous arthropods (disease vectors) and the risk
    of vector-borne diseases are being evaluated.
  10: The paper discusses the potential economic costs and health impacts of hematophagous
    arthropods on human societies.
  11: Economic damages and public health impacts (medical costs, nuisance biting,
    impacts on recreational and real estate values, productivity loss, tourism, blood-supply
    system, personal protection, and quality of life) due to invasive hematophagous
    arthropods and the diseases they vector.
  12: No relevant information
  14: Nuisances to wildlife, health and economic concerns posed to human populations,
    outbreaks
Highlights:
  2: Strong preventative monitoring and transboundary surveillance measures are urgently
    required to mitigate future invasions of hematophagous arthropods and novel disease
    outbreaks.
  3: Invasive hematophagous arthropods contribute to major ecological, economic, and
    health problems due to their role as disease vectors.
  7: Human-made microhabitats have amplified translocation rates and establishment
    possibilities for mosquito species with adaptations such as drought- and freeze-resistant
    eggs.
  8: Climate change is likely to worsen health risks by increasing zoonotic diseases,
    transmission and disease vector population growth after the arrival of alien hematophagous
    arthropods.
  9: Climate change is expected to influence the range and proliferation of vector
    species like mosquitoes and ticks, potentially increasing the risk of vector-borne
    diseases.
  10: Climate change will exacerbate economic and health impacts associated with the
    spread of hematophagous insects, serving as a significant risk factor for disease
    transmission.
  11: Failing to respond rapidly to invasive hematophagous arthropods could prove
    more costly in the future; climate change is likely to increase economic impacts
    from hematophagous arthropods that vector diseases.
  12: Urbanization can have both positive and negative impacts on different mosquito
    species; NPK fertilizers significantly increase mosquito larvae survival; light
    pollution extends mosquito breeding seasons; insecticide use leads to resistance.
  14: Knowledge gaps and growing risks posed by accelerated worldwide urbanization
    and interconnectivity; surveillance systems and strong political commitment are
    required for disease prevention programs; social-ethnological approaches are valuable
    for mitigation measures

  9: The paper suggests modeling efforts should concentrate on worldwide projections
    of vector-borne diseases under different future scenarios involving climate change,
    pollution, and urbanization. Results are applicable to future scenarios.
  12: Laboratory studies found survival rates differences in contaminated vs. uncontaminated
    waters.

  1: This page is primarily publication information and licensing details for the
    Cuthbert et al. (2023) paper. It does not contain specific research findings or
    data that would be directly relevant to the U.S. National Climate Assessment
  2: Proactive approaches, such as monitoring and increased engagement in citizen
    science, could reduce epidemiological and ecological risks and save millions of
    lives and billions of dollars.
  3: The paper discusses the urgent need for more research on the impact of global
    change on the population dynamics of invasive species and the epidemiology of
    diseases they might transmit.
  7: The trade of used tires since the 1950s and ornamental plants such as lucky bamboo
    are principal entry points for invasive mosquito species.
  8: The page also discusses surveillance techniques for alien insect species and
    the potential for these insects to spread via increased connectivity due to the
    BRI project.
  11: The paper highlights the underestimation of the global economic burden associated
    with invasive hematophagous arthropods and the importance of better biosecurity
    control.
  12: The paper discusses the interplay between urbanization, agricultural practices,
    environmental pollution, and mosquito populations. The distinction between 'health'
    versus 'environment' perspectives on hematophagous arthropods is also mentioned.
  13: The paper highlights the importance of shipping and air traffic, the transport
    of vertebrates (i.e. livestock and pets) and worn tires as prominent factors and
    sources assisting the introduction of hematophagous arthropods that vector diseases.
  14: Focuses on hematophagous arthropods (principally mosquitoes and ticks) and their
    role as disease vectors.

    (from 1999 in North America).
  8: For Ae. aegypti, an increasing global suitability for life cycle completion of
    +1.5% per decade between 1950 and 2000, with that trend predicted to accelerate
    and increase by +3.2% per decade, and even up to +4.4% per decade, by 2050.

    to survive.
  11: Current management delays of 55 years for the Aedes genus have led to an additional
    cost of US$ 4.57 billion that could have been avoided.
