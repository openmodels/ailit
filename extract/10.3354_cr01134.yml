Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased typhoon intensity due to rising greenhouse gas levels
  2: Climate change-induced increases in tropical cyclone intensity.
  4: Increases in tropical cyclone intensity due to climate change, assessed up to
    the year 2085, and the lengthening of the tropical cyclone season or increased
    storm frequency.
  5: Increases in the intensity of tropical storms due to global warming, specifically
    focusing on changes in maximum sustained wind speed and the size of the storm
    (radius of 50 kn winds).
  7: Global warming and the increased intensity/frequency of tropical cyclones, specifically
    the duration of high winds (50 knots)
  8: Tropical storms and cyclones, particularly affecting housing and vulnerable regions
    in the Philippines.
  9: Climate change-induced increases in tropical cyclone intensity is the primary
    driver of risk.
Highlights:
  1: Increased typhoon intensity could lead to a significant increase (17-58%) in
    direct damage to housing in the Philippines by 2085.
  2: Focuses on the less studied case of the Philippines to understand the economic
    effects of tropical cyclone intensity on housing damages.
  7: Direct damage from future tropical cyclones on housing could increase significantly
    in the Philippines due to climate change. In some regions, housing damage could
    increase by up to 58% over current expectations based on historical trends.
  8: The analysis focuses on the impact of tropical cyclones on housing damage, indicating
    significant increases in damage, especially in the northern regions of the Philippines.
  9: Climate change could significantly increase housing damage in the Philippines
    due to increased tropical cyclone intensity. The results are likely lower-bound
    estimates, and hence can be deemed conservative.
Methodology:
  1: Monte Carlo simulation magnifies the intensity of historical tropical cyclones
    (1978-2008) to project housing damage in the Philippines by 2085.
  2: Applies techniques used in studies of developed countries to the case of the
    Philippines, focusing on the impact of potential climate change-induced increases
    in tropical cyclone intensity on housing damage.
  4: "A Monte Carlo simulation methodology, based on Esteban et al. (2010), is used\
    \ to estimate the Expected Affected Time (\u02C6\u03D1) an area is under the influence\
    \ of wind of a certain strength in 1 future year. This involves generating a random\
    \ number of tropical cyclones per month based on historical probability distributions\
    \ (1971-2006), selecting random historical cyclone tracks (1978-2008), and simulating\
    \ storm intensity increase based on Knutson & Tuleya (2004)."
  5: The study simulates tropical cyclone size and intensity using historical data
    and climate change scenarios, modifying historical tropical cyclone data based
    on a random value drawn from a probability distribution function of intensity
    increases. The impact of storms on damage is assumed to be non-linear.
  7: Wind damage functions are derived based on analysis of 6 years of data. Linear
    regression is used to model the relationship between the duration of high winds
    and the number of damaged buildings. Results are deemed conservative due to data
    limitations and potential underestimation of damage from stronger storms.
  9: A model is used based on historical tropical cyclones and altered strength using
    estimates of typhoon intensity increases from Knutson & Tuleya (2004).  The model
    reproduces the number of storms that occur during each month, but does not do
    it temporally.
More Notes:
  1: The study assumes adaptive capacity remains constant between now and 2085. The
    percentage increase in damage depends on adaptive capacity of each region in the
    Philippines.
  4: "The study uses best track data from the Japan Meteorological Agency. The simulation\
    \ uses N = 5000 runs for >99% accuracy compared to N = 50000. The increase in\
    \ storm intensity by 2085 is based on simulations with a sea surface temperature\
    \ change of +0.8 to +2.4\xB0C, assuming a linear +1% compounded annual increase\
    \ in CO2 concentrations reaching 2.2 times the 2004 value by 2085."
  7: The analysis focuses solely on damage to housing and does not consider other
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. The damage functions used may underestimate
    the impact of the strongest storms.
  8: The study notes the complexity of policy-making in balancing adaptation strategies
    while considering regional vulnerabilities and socio-economic factors.
  9: The study acknowledges limitations related to changes in cyclone paths and translation
    speed, the temporal distribution of storms, and the lack of consideration for
    other types of damage (infrastructure, agriculture, human casualties). The model
    also assumes that the adaptive capacity for each area of the Philippines will
    remain unaltered.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Direct damage to housing
  2: The paper aims to estimate how climate change-induced increases in tropical cyclone
    intensity can affect damages to housing in the Philippines.
  7: Direct damage from future tropical cyclones on housing in the Philippines
  9: The research uses housing damage as a proxy for direct monetary damage from tropical
    cyclones.
Quantitative material:
  1: Direct damage to housing could increase between 17 and 58 % by 2085, depending
    on adaptive capacity.
  5: The study uses the equation R50 = -81.345 + 2.099 Wmax + e (R2 = 0.59) to model
    the relationship between the radius of 50 kn winds (R50) and maximum sustained
    wind speed (Wmax).
  7: 'Expected percentage increases in housing damage for two climate change scenarios
    (Scenario A and Scenario B) are provided for various regions of the Philippines.
    Increase in damage to houses (%) for Regions I, II, CARa: 18 (Scenario A), 37
    (Scenario B); III, IV-A, NCRb: 28 (Scenario A), 58 (Scenario B); IV-Bc: 29 (Scenario
    A), 58 (Scenario B); V, VI, VII, VIIId: 21 (Scenario A), 47 (Scenario B). Expected
    damage can be as high as 30 (Scenario A) to 36 (Scenario B) houses per 1000 inhabitants
    in worst affected areas (Regions V, VI, VII, and VIII) up from 25 in control scenario.'
  8: Simulations suggest housing damage can increase by up to 58% in some regions
    based on the climate scenario.
  9: Potential housing damage might increase significantly, up to 58% in certain regions
    of the Philippines by 2085, assuming no changes in adaptive capacity.
