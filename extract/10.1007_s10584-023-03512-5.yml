Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts on the Russian Arctic
  2: Climate change impacts, specifically accelerated warming, shrinking Arctic sea
    ice cover, permafrost thawing, and greater accessibility of Arctic hydrocarbons
    and bioresources.
  3: Permafrost thawing, increased frequency and intensity of catastrophic events,
    extinction of Arctic species, impact on the lifestyle of the indigenous population,
    global energy transition, physical climate risks.
  4: Global warming leading to Arctic ice melt, creating both opportunities and challenges.
  6: Permafrost melting, increase in air temperature, disruption of the icy transition
    layer, increased depth of seasonal thawing.
  7: Permafrost thawing leading to reduced ground bearing capacity.
  8: No relevant information
  9: Permafrost degradation affects transportation, oil extraction, and the release
    of hazardous substances.
  10: Lack of technologies in infrastructure and shipbuilding exacerbated by Western
    economic sanctions; Delay in launching Arctic LNG-2 project due to unspecified
    challenges.
  13: Permafrost melting, reduction of ice cover in the Arctic Ocean, coastal erosion,
    temperature, and precipitation changes.
  14: Climate change impacts in the Russian Arctic, including climate and socio-economic
    variations across territories. Transitional risks associated with the global low-carbon
    transition.
Highlights:
  1: Policies rhetorically aim at contributing to resilient and sustainable growth
    in the Russian North, but remain under-developed in accounting for multiple climate-related
    risks.
  2: Climate change in the Arctic, while presenting risks, also opens new possibilities
    for economic development for Russia. The scale and direction of climate change
    impacts on the Russian economy are still largely uncertain.
  3: Lack of comprehensive understanding of climate change impacts on economic development
    in Russia hinders effective Arctic policy implementation. The paper aims to systematize
    available estimates on climate change impact on economic development of the Russian
    North and identify key areas of state policy to minimize uncertainty, effectively
    manage climate risks, and exploit new opportunities, taking into account regional
    specifics of the Arctic territories of Russia.
  4: The Northern Sea Route has the potential to significantly contribute to the economic
    development of the Arctic region through domestic and export shipping, although
    it faces challenges in becoming a major transit route.
  6: Ignoring permafrost melting in models leads to inaccurate assessments of climate
    change impacts on the Russian economy, and can overestimate potential benefits
    while underestimating losses. Models frequently do not incorporate permafrost
    melting.
  7: Permafrost thawing poses a significant risk to infrastructure and facilities
    in Russia, with potential for substantial economic damage.
  8: No relevant information
  9: Permafrost degradation impacts transportation, reduces oil productivity, and
    poses health risks; implies economic loss.
  10: Russia views climate change in the Arctic primarily as an opportunity for economic
    development rather than a threat, as reflected in policy documents and public
    discussions.
  13: International cooperation is crucial but currently hindered by geopolitical
    barriers.
Methodology:
  1: Review of key policy documents issued in Russia and ongoing and planned development
    programs
  3: Analysis of domestic policy documents, available literature, analysis of implemented
    and scheduled infrastructure, and energy projects in the region.
  4: No relevant information
  8: No relevant information
  13: Needs regular knowledge base updates due to rapid climatic changes in Arctic.
More Notes:
  1: The paper suggests a comprehensive framework of Arctic policy measures centered
    around climate change.
  4: The paper highlights the increased accessibility of Arctic resources, including
    hydrocarbons and rare earth metals, due to ice melt, which could further contribute
    to economic development.
  6: The paper argues that negative consequences of Arctic warming will occur regardless
    of policy action, while opportunities to benefit from climate change require policy
    action, investment, and technological solutions.
  7: Russian Building Codes and Regulations require at least 40% reserve of bearing
    capacity, which will be violated in the coming decade on most of the permafrost
    area.
  8: This page primarily summarizes findings from other studies regarding the economic
    consequences of permafrost thaw in Russia. It doesn't contribute original methodology
    or findings to the literature, so it is of limited value for my analytical synthesis.
  9: High uncertainties exist due to sparse data and monitoring challenges in Arctic
    regions, complicating economic risk assessments.
  10: The page focuses on Russia's strategic development plans for the Arctic, particularly
    regarding resource extraction and the Northern Sea Route, and acknowledges some
    challenges to these plans.
  14: The paper acknowledges support from the HSE University Basic Research Program
    and the Faculty of World Economy and International Affairs. The research project
    focuses on climate change adaptation policies in the Russian Arctic.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Minimizing net costs of climate change; resilient and sustainable growth in the
    Russian North
  2: The paper mentions the potential for both positive and negative impacts of climate
    change on the Russian economy, including GDP effects (positive and negative),
    and regional development prospects.
  3: Economic development in Russia, specifically related to the Russian Arctic development
    policy.
  4: Economic development of the Arctic region, specifically related to domestic and
    export shipping using the Northern Sea Route.
  6: Climate change-induced damage for the Russian economy, including the economic
    challenges of permafrost melting, agricultural yields, winter mortality, heating
    requirements, and tourism.
  7: Potentially systemic macroeconomic risk to large parts of the Russian economy
    due to permafrost thawing.
  8: No relevant information
  10: Economic growth in the Arctic region is a key focus; Increased cargo traffic
    along the Northern Sea Route (NSR) is a target.
Quantitative material:
  2: "The northern regions of Russia make up about 10% of national GDP and contribute\
    \ around 20% to the Russia\u2019s total exports. The Arctic accounts for the production\
    \ of 18% of oil and 90% of natural and associated gas in Russia. About 90% of\
    \ nickel and cobalt, 60% of copper, and almost 100% of diamonds and rare earth\
    \ metals are extracted there. Around 2.5 million people in Russia live above the\
    \ Arctic Circle. The Arctic surface temperature has risen twice as fast as the\
    \ world average over the last two decades."
  4: No relevant information
  7: Maintaining and repairing infrastructure as well as its protection from the melting
    permafrost costs 55 billion rubles.
  8: No relevant information
  9: "Winter road operation period decreased by 7\u201310 days in the past 30 years;\
    \ oil extraction losses may reach 10\u201320%; healthcare costs could rise by\
    \ 3% of the total annual healthcare budget."
  10: Cargo traffic along the NSR amounted to 34.8 million tons in 2021, a six-fold
    increase from 2014; Strategy aims for 47 million tons of cargo traffic through
    the NSR by 2023 and over 238 million tons by 2035.
