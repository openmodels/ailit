Drivers of Risk:
  1: Methane emissions leading to ground-level ozone formation
  2: Methane emissions contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone, which affects
    respiratory health and causes premature mortality.
  3: The driver of risk is methane emissions, which affect ozone concentrations.
  4: Elevated atmospheric loading of methane.
  5: Changes in ozone concentrations due to methane (CH4) emissions.
  6: The analysis considers changes in respiratory mortality rates and their relationship
    with cardiovascular and pulmonary mortality, which are influenced by factors within
    the IFs model (unspecified on this page). It also acknowledges ozone mortality
    impacts.
  7: Shocks in methane emissions affect outcomes related to ozone-related mortality.
  9: Methane emissions, specifically through ozone concentration responses and influenced
    by factors like emission year, population, and income growth.
  11: Climate system changes lead to temperature increases, affecting climate and
    mortality damages.
  12: Reduction in ozone concentrations resulting from reduced CH4 emissions.
  14: Changes in methane emissions are impacting cardiovascular and pulmonary mortality
    through short-term and long-term ozone exposure.
  16: The exclusion of particulate matter concentrations and health impacts that may
    result from reduced methane emissions.
Evaluation overview:

    mortality due to cardiovascular and respiratory disease.
  6: This section focuses on the valuation of changes in mortality, specifically estimating
    the monetary value of reduced mortality due to indirect health benefits of CH4
    mitigation.
  7: The paper provides an overview of the valuation of avoided mortality from ozone-related
    health benefits due to changes in methane emissions.
  9: "Valuing the Ozone-Related Health Bene\uFB01ts of Methane Emission; focuses on\
    \ short-term mortality impacts."

  14: The paper evaluates the mortality outcomes related to reductions in methane

    to changes in ozone exposure.
  15: The paper provides an overview of ozone-related mortality outcomes as a result
    of methane emissions from 2010 to 2050, focusing on both short-term and long-term
    health benefits.
  16: The paper estimates premature mortality benefits from reducing ozone concentrations
    by decreasing methane emissions.
Highlights:
  1: "Reducing methane emissions slows climate change and reduces ozone-related mortality.\
    \ The global short- and long-term premature mortality benefits due to reduced\
    \ ozone production from methane mitigation are (2011) $790 and $1775 per tonne\
    \ methane, respectively. These correspond to approximately 70 and 150 % of the\
    \ valuation of methane\u2019s global climate impacts using the SCC. Most of the\
    \ global mortality benefits accrue in Asia, but 10 % accrue in the United States."
  2: Methane emission reductions have both climate and health benefits; the ozone
    response to methane reductions is largely insensitive to the location of emissions
    reductions, allowing global benefits per tonne of methane reduced.
  3: The paper produces monetized benefits of reductions that are consistent with
    the methodology used for development of the US Government calculations of the
    SCC and estimates avoided respiratory mortality associated with mitigating a marginal
    tonne of CH4 emissions in a given year.
  6: The study tests the sensitivity of results to baseline mortality rates, methods
    of extrapolating VSL, and different discount rates.
  7: Key outcome includes the estimation of mortality benefits from reduced atmospheric
    methane with economic valuations provided for these health benefits.
  9: Value of Statistical Life and Emission Year have the largest impact on the estimates;
    Ozone-mediated mortality benefits from methane emissions are less sensitive to
    discounting than the Social Cost of Carbon.
  11: Climate damages from future changes grow slower than temperature-independent
    mortality damages.
  12: The benefits accrued by individual regions is very sensitive to the VSL methodology.
  13: "East Asia and Southeast Asia show the highest positive benefits in response\
    \ to changes in VSL methodology, particularly in the scenario where \u03B5=1."
  14: Long-term mortality impacts are based on the population aged 30 and above, which
    is growing faster than the total population.
  15: The paper highlights that methane emissions have increasing costs over time,
    with Global Long-term costs rising more steeply than Global Short-term.
  16: "The mortality benefits are valued at (2011)$790/t\u2013CH4 for short-term peak\
    \ ozone exposure and $1,775/t\u2013CH4 for long-term peak ozone exposure."
Methodology:
  1: Consistent with methods used by the US Government to estimate the social cost
    of carbon (SCC).
  2: The benefits of methane reduction are quantified using the Social Cost of Methane
    (SC-CH4) and the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC).
  3: The approach calculates avoided respiratory mortality over several decades associated
    with mitigating a marginal tonne of CH4 emissions, then values and discounts the
    mortality reduction back to the year of emissions. It uses existing literature
    on the relationships between CH4 emissions and O3 concentrations, changes in O3
    concentrations and short-term mortality, future scenarios of population and income,
    and the value of lives lost. The methane is assumed to have a lifetime of 12 years,
    consistent with the IPCC AR4 (IPCC 2007).
  4: Uses epidemiologically-derived health impact functions and log-linear relationships
    between ozone concentration and relative risk to estimate mortality impacts. Applies
    concentration-response relationships globally.
  5: The analysis projects population and baseline mortality over the coming century.  They
    estimate the effects of long-term exposure to peak ozone concentrations only for
    the population ages 30 and above. Baseline death rates from cardiovascular and
    respiratory disease are applied to all socio-economic scenarios. Death rates are
    held constant at 2100 levels through 2120.
  6: The study estimates respiratory mortality rates for the population ages 30+ from
    2010-2100 by scaling 2010 respiratory mortality with cardiovascular and pulmonary
    mortality rates from the IFs model. It monetizes mortality changes using a Value
    of Statistical Life (VSL) approach, extrapolating VSL across regions and time
    based on income elasticity. Net Present Value (NPV) is calculated by discounting
    future benefits to the year of emission.
  7: The analysis uses a Ramsey discounting framework with different discount rates
    to test sensitivity and Monte Carlo simulations with various input parameters
    including socioeconomic scenarios, and VSL estimation methods.
  9: Sensitivity analysis performed, varying parameters such as Value of Statistical
    Life (VSL), emission year, CVP mortality response, discount rate, O3 concentration
    response, baseline CVP mortality, and scenario to assess their impact on mortality
    benefits. Applicable to evaluating short-term mortality impacts from methane emissions.
  11: Utilizes EMF 22 exercise scenarios from various models to project future socioeconomic
    impacts.
  13: The analysis uses a Value of Statistical Life (VSL) elasticity methodology,
    comparing scenarios with different elasticity values of 0, 0.4, and 1 across time
    and regions.
  14: The analysis tests sensitivity to various parameters, focusing on the concentration-response
    factor for long-term mortality, which has a large confidence interval.
  15: The analysis follows the decay of a pulse of methane over time, reflecting changes
    in mortality due to ozone concentrations applied to populations of corresponding
    years.
  16: The estimates align methodologically with those used in estimating the social
    cost of carbon values by the US Government for regulatory analyses.
More Notes:
  1: Monetized benefits are sensitive to the choice of elasticity to income growth
    used when calculating the value of a statistical life. The benefits increase for
    emission years further in the future.
  5: The authors acknowledge that detailed demographic projections are not available
    for the individual scenarios, so the values should be interpreted as a sensitivity
    test.
  6: GDP data for the EMF 22 scenarios is in 2005$ and is adjusted to 2011$ using
    a multiplier of 1.0608.
  9: The figure shows sensitivity of mortality estimates to various parameters. Estimates
    using a constant VSL are larger than the base method. The impact of discount rates
    on methane's mortality benefits are lower than on the SCC.
  12: Estimates are dependent not only on the VSL within a region, but also on the
    total population and the baseline cardiovascular and pulmonary death rates.
Quantitative material:
  1: Global short-term premature mortality benefits due to reduced ozone production
    from methane mitigation are (2011) $790 per tonne methane; long-term benefits
    are $1775 per tonne methane. 10% of the global mortality benefits accrue in the
    United States.
  3: The analysis estimates avoided respiratory mortality associated with mitigating
    a marginal tonne of CH4 emissions in a given year.
  4: "\u0394O3(t) = 13/12 * exp(-(t)/12): Ozone response in year t to a 1 Tg pulse\
    \ of methane at time zero."
  5: The analysis uses population projections from four integrated assessment models
    (MiniCAM, MESSAGE, MERGE, and IMAGE) aggregated to eight global regions. It also
    uses country-level projections of total cardiovascular and pulmonary deaths through
    2100.
  6: VSL is anchored to $8.84 million per premature death (2011$). Elasticity sensitivities
    of 0.0, 0.4, and 1.0 are used to extrapolate VSL. Discount rates of 2.5, 3.0,
    5.0, and 7.0% are tested.
  7: "The base estimate suggests a decrease of one million tonnes in methane emissions\
    \ would avoid 239 short-term and 591 long-term premature deaths globally, valued\
    \ monetarily at (2011)$790/t\u2013CH4 and (2011)$1,775/t\u2013CH4, respectively."
  9: Benefits per tonne more than doubling for methane emitted between 2010 and 2050;
    Assuming constant CVP mortality from 2010 to 2120, benefit per tonne in 2010 is
    6% lower, and in 2050 it decreases the estimate by 30%; 2020 estimate is roughly
    12% lower using constant mortality rate; Using a 2.5% discount rate yields an
    estimate 1.3 times the estimate with a 5% discount rate.
  11: Ozone-related mortality benefits are sensitive to the year of emission and socioeconomic
    scenarios.
  12: "With constant VSL (\u03B5 = 0), the US value is roughly 5 % of the global estimate,\
    \ while with a VSL that varies linearly with per capita income (\u03B5 = 1) increases\
    \ the fraction of benefits that accrue in the US to 25 %."
  13: Quantitative information includes avoided mortality per 1 MMT decrease in CH4
    for various regions and years, as well as percentage changes in response to different
    VSL methodologies.
  14: Short-term benefits per tonne increase from $634 to $1,428 over the same period.
  15: Quantitative information includes cost evaluations per metric ton of CH4 in
    2011 USD, starting at 1,000 USD for Global Long-term and 500 USD for Global Short-term,
    rising to approximately 3,500 USD and 1,500 USD by 2050, respectively.
  16: It is estimated that a one million tonne decrease in methane emissions in 2020
    will avoid 239 premature cardiovascular and pulmonary deaths globally due to short-term
    peak ozone exposure and 591 premature respiratory deaths globally due to long-term
    peak ozone exposure.
