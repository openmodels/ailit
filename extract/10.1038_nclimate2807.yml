Drivers of Risk:
  1: Thawing permafrost leading to CO2 and CH4 emissions increases climate warming.
  2: Permafrost emissions of CO2 and CH4, temperature increases, socio-economic scenarios.
  3: Thawing permafrost and CO2 and CH4 emissions are drivers impacting global mean
    temperature rise.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Global economic impacts of CO2 and CH4 emissions from thawing permafrost are
    evaluated.
  2: Economic and non-economic impacts of permafrost emissions, expressed in monetary
    terms.
  3: Global mean temperature rise relative to pre-industrial conditions.
Highlights:
  1: CO2 and CH4 released from permafrost increases the mean net present value (NPV)
    of the impacts of climate change by US$43 trillion, or about 13%.
  2: Permafrost emissions have significant economic impacts, and aggressive abatement
    strategies can substantially reduce these impacts. The extra impacts of the permafrost
    CO2 and CH4 emissions release are sufficiently high to justify urgent action to
    minimize the scale of the release.
  3: "Permafrost emissions increase global mean temperature rise. Under the A1B scenario,\
    \ CO2 emissions from thawing permafrost could add nearly 1\xB0C to global mean\
    \ temperature by 2200. The 5-95% confidence intervals suggest a wide range of\
    \ possible temperature outcomes."
Methodology:
  1: The study links the PAGE09 integrated assessment model with the SiBCASA biophysical
    land surface parameterization model. 100,000 simulations are run perturbing model
    parameters.
  2: Uses the PAGE09 model to estimate the extra economic impacts from permafrost
    emissions. Results applicable through 2200, contingent on emission scenarios and
    model parameters.
  3: Simulations were performed using the PAGE9 model, with and without permafrost
    emissions. Results are applicable for the IPCC AR4 A1B scenario.
More Notes:
  1: The study makes the conservative assumption that anthropogenic emissions stop
    after 2100, but permafrost emissions continue to affect global mean temperature
    to 2200 and beyond.
  2: 'The uncertainty range is wide due to the complex interactions within the model.
    Six inputs are the most influential: TCR, PTP, EMUC, permafrost emissions, FRT,
    POW_2.'
  3: The paper uses the IPCC AR4 A1B scenario to project future emissions and temperature
    changes.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Permafrost emissions increase the mean net present value (NPV) of climate change\
    \ impacts by US$43 trillion (5-95% range US$3 \u2013 166 trillion) under the A1B\
    \ scenario."
  2: Permafrost emissions represent about 10% of cumulative anthropogenic emissions
    since pre-industrial times by 2200 and contribute about 7% of the total mean warming.
    Extra impacts are about US $2.8 trillion in 2100 (about 0.35% of projected global
    GDP) and peaks at about US $30 trillion in 2200 (about 0.7% of projected global
    GDP). Mean NPV of extra economic impacts increases to US$54 trillion and US$91
    trillion under SSP2 and SSP3 scenarios, respectively. Under an aggressive abatement
    scenario (UK Met Office 2015r5low), the mean NPV of the extra impacts falls to
    US$6 trillion, with a 5-95% range of US$ 0.4-17 trillion.
  3: Estimated annual emissions of CO2 from thawing permafrost, global mean temperature
    rise relative to pre-industrial conditions. CO2 emissions from thawing permafrost
    are estimated to peak slightly above 8,000 MtCO2 around 2060 under the A1B scenario.
