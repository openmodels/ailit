Drivers of Risk:
  3: Temperature changes and rainfall fluctuations.
  4: Climate change is impacting livestock through changes in reproduction, feed conversion
    ratio, health, water availability, feed quality, and the frequency of diseases.
  6: The primary drivers of risk are changes in average temperature and total precipitation.
  7: The drivers of risk are temperature (degrees Celsius) and precipitation (mm units
    per year).
  8: The drivers of risk are temperature and precipitation fluctuations.
  9: The drivers of risk are temperature, temperature squared, precipitation, and
    precipitation squared.
  10: Temperature changes (tropical and temperate), Precipitation changes (tropical
    and temperate).
  11: Temperature + precipitation (aggregate impacts)
Evaluation overview:
  3: Global livestock production.
  6: This paper evaluates the impact of climate change on animal production (specifically,
    log animal production in tonnes).
  7: The paper evaluates the impact of temperature and precipitation on beef production.
  8: The paper evaluates the impact of weather changes on global beef production.
  9: This table evaluates the impact of weather fluctuations on cereal yield (ton/ha)
    and production (kg).
  10: Impact of weather variation and climate change on beef production.
  11: Aggregate impact on beef production
Highlights:
  3: Robust negative effect of temperature changes on global livestock production
    and a positive impact of rainfall fluctuations. The effect of temperature is more
    concentrated in hot, poor, and agricultural-dependent countries. Rainfall in tropical
    regions moderates temperature-caused adverse effects, while in temperate regions
    it aggravates them.
  4: Several channels through which weather shocks influence livestock production
    are explored, including mortality and productivity changes from direct and indirect
    climate impacts.
  6: Temperature increases are predicted to negatively impact animal production, with
    a more significant impact in tropical and poor countries.
  8: Temperature has a negative impact on both cereal yields and cereal production,
    especially in hot countries; Precipitation changes have a positive relationship
    with crop outcomes.
  9: Temperature generally has a negative impact on cereal yield and production, while
    precipitation generally has a positive impact. The impact magnitudes vary depending
    on the region (tropical, poor, agriculture-dependent).
  10: Warming has a greater negative impact on beef production than rainfall changes.
    Poor and agricultural-dependent countries in the tropics are most severely affected
    by warming. Adverse effect of climate change on beef production is almost completely
    centered in tropical countries.
  11: "Maps represent aggregate (temperature + precipitation) impacts (as log changes)\
    \ from ACCESS-ESM1.5 for (a) mid-term climate change (2041-2060) and (b) long-run\
    \ climate change (2081-2100) under SSP3-7.0 scenario. Changes are relative to\
    \ a 1981\u20132010 baseline."
Methodology:
  3: Panel data analysis of national livestock production and local weather fluctuations
    from 187 countries. Accounts for omitted variable bias and uses spatial and temporal
    dimensions to identify effects of short-term weather shocks. The methodology does
    not account for adaptation or interseasonal changes in weather.
  4: The analysis uses a reduced-form framework to assess the general effects of annual
    weather fluctuations on global livestock production, using a combination of cattle
    production data, historical weather, and climate change prediction data.
  6: The paper uses an error-corrected model and assesses predicted climate change
    impacts for the medium-term (2041-2060) and long-term (2061-2100) future periods,
    with spatial (1000 km) and serial (3-years) correlation errors adjusted.
  8: "The analysis uses country fixed effects and region-specific trends, with standard\
    \ errors adjusted for spatial (1,000km) and serial (3-years) correlation; Sample\
    \ period is 1961\u20132017."
  9: The coefficients are estimated from separate regressions with country fixed effects
    and region-specific trends, using data from 1961-2017. Standard errors are adjusted
    for spatial (1,000km) and serial (3-years) correlation. The level of significance
    is indicated by asterisks.
  10: Panel data analysis from 1961 to 2017, using long differences and panel estimates
    to measure the impact of weather fluctuations. Climate change projections are
    based on ACCESS-ESM1.5 mid-term (2041-2060) and long-run (2081-2100) scenarios
    under SSP3-7.0 relative to a 1981-2010 baseline.
  11: Panel data model; Long differences method; Applies econometric techniques
More Notes:
  6: The data is cattle population adjusted. The animal indicator is cattle stock.
  8: Table 3 shows the 'Robustness' of various changes in model specification on the
    relationship between temperature and precipitation on the beef production outcome;
    The analysis investigates how weather changes affect beef production via impacts
    on crop production, particularly cereal yields and production.
  10: The study acknowledges limitations related to inter-annual farmer tradeoffs
    not being captured by the panel data method, which may lead to picking up short-run
    changes in cattle inventory rather than long-run climate change impacts.
  11: The panel data model does not account for adaptation to gradual changes in climate
    at the country-level.
Quantitative material:
  3: Climate change will reduce animal output by a further 20% in the mid-century
    and an additional 40% by the end of the century.
  6: "The paper provides predicted changes in average temperature, total precipitation,\
    \ and log animal production for various regions under the SSP3.70 scenario for\
    \ medium-term (2041-2060) and long-term (2061-2100) periods, including percentage\
    \ changes from historical figures. It also includes summary statistics for historical\
    \ data (1961-2017) for each of the variables. A 1\xB0C increase in temperature\
    \ leads to a 9.7% reduction in beef production. A 1\xB0C increase in temperature\
    \ will reduce animal production by 27% in poor countries and 4% in rich ones."
  8: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature is associated with a 3.7% drop in cereal yields;\
    \ This impact is about 3.4 percentage points higher in tropical countries; a 1\xB0\
    C higher temperature is associated with a 7.6% drop in global cereal production;\
    \ A marginal increase in annual rainfall is associated with a 1.5% increase in\
    \ global cereal yield; This impact is larger in tropical countries where a similar\
    \ increase in annual precipitation will result in a 2.8% rise in cereal yield."
  9: The table provides quantitative estimates of the impact of temperature and precipitation
    (and their squares) on cereal yield and production. For example, a 1 degree Celsius
    increase in temperature is associated with a -0.0372 ton/ha change in aggregate
    yield, and a -0.076 kg change in aggregate production.
  10: "A 1 \xB0C increase in temperature leads to a 9.7% reduction in beef production\
    \ globally, with larger effects in tropical countries (27% reduction in poorer\
    \ countries). An additional mm of annual precipitation leads to a 2.1% increase\
    \ in production in tropical countries but a 1.9% decrease in temperate ones. Predicted\
    \ loss in global beef production due to climate change in 2060 ranges from 11%\
    \ (temperate regions) to 36% (tropical areas)."
  11: "Aggregate impacts (as log changes) from ACCESS-ESM1.5 for (a) mid-term climate\
    \ change and (b) long-run climate change under SSP3-7.0 scenario. Changes are\
    \ relative to a 1981\u20132010 baseline."
