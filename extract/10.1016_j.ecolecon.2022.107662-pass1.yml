Drivers of Risk:
  1: Annual weather fluctuations
  2: Temperature increases, changes in precipitation patterns.
  3: Temperature changes; Rainfall fluctuations; Climate change.
  4: Climate change (increased global surface temperatures, altered precipitation
    patterns) affecting livestock production.
  5: "Annual average temperature (in \xB0C) and yearly total precipitation (in mm/year)"
  6: Increase in average temperature affecting animal production across regions.
  7: Temperature and precipitation changes impacting beef production, with stronger
    effects in hot, poor, and agriculture-dependent regions.
  9: Temperature fluctuations (degrees Celsius) and precipitation fluctuations (mm
    per year).
  10: Temperature and precipitation changes due to climate change.
  11: Temperature and precipitation changes due to climate change
Highlights:
  1: Open access article published in Ecological Economics by Elsevier; discusses
    the impact of annual weather fluctuations on global livestock production
  2: Temperature increases significantly reduce beef production globally, particularly
    in hot, poor, and agriculture-dependent countries. The effect of precipitation
    varies by climate zone. Significant future reductions in animal output are projected
    due to climate change.
  3: Temperature increases negatively impact global livestock production, especially
    in hot, poor, and agriculture-dependent countries; Rainfall has a positive effect,
    though this varies regionally (benefits in tropical regions, aggravates in temperate
    regions).
  4: Analyzes the effect of annual weather fluctuations on global livestock production.
  5: Weather variations have heterogeneous impact on animal production based on country's
    temperature, income classification and agricultural role.
  6: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature reduces animal production by 27% in poor countries\
    \ and 4% in rich ones."
  7: Beef production is most at risk in hot, poor, and agriculture-dependent countries
    due to temperature changes; increased rainfall can mitigate negative temperature
    effects.
  9: Temperature increases negatively impact cereal yield and production. Precipitation
    increases positively impact cereal yield and production. The impact of weather
    fluctuations differs based on whether a country is tropical, poor, or agriculture-dependent,
    with tropical countries experiencing the largest impacts. The paper finds no significant
    evidence of adaptation in beef production in response to medium-term weather changes,
    but this conclusion may change with a more disaggregated dataset.
  10: Climate change affects livestock production and, consequently, food security,
    especially in poor and tropical regions; Global warming is expected to have a
    more significant role in determining livestock output than rainfall changes in
    the longer term; Mitigation and adaptation policies are important to protect the
    sustainability of livestock production.
  11: Climate change is predicted to have a negative impact on beef production. The
    model does not fully account for adaptation, and the absence of adaptation should
    be considered with reference to country-level data.
Methodology:
  1: Re-examining the impact of annual weather fluctuations on global livestock production.
  2: Panel data analysis using an econometric strategy to examine the relationship
    between weather changes and global livestock production, addressing shortcomings
    of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) and cross-sectional (Ricardian) methods.
  3: Panel data analysis using group fixed effects to account for omitted variables,
    exploiting cross-time variations in weather to identify causal effects.
  4: Employs a reduced-form framework to analyze the general pass-through effect of
    annual weather fluctuations on global livestock production using country-level
    cattle production data, historical weather data, and climate change projection
    data. Uses the ACCESS-ESM1.5 climate model (SSP3-7.0 scenario) to project temperature
    and precipitation from 1970 to 2100. Examines medium-term (2041-2060) and long-run
    (2081-2100) impacts. Uses cattle population-weighted weather averages.
  5: Panel data model at the country/year level with country fixed effects and region-specific
    trends. Spatial and serial correlation in the standard error terms are controlled
    for.  A panel Granger causality Wald test is conducted. Sensitivity checks are
    performed to ascertain robustness of results.
  6: Analysis includes temperature impact on animal production, adjusted for spatial
    and serial correlation, and uses cattle stock as an outcome variable.
  7: Analysis performed using country fixed effects and region-specific trends, considering
    both spatial and serial correlations; robustness tested with lagged weather outcomes
    and interaction terms.
  9: Panel data regressions with country fixed effects and region-specific trends.
    Standard errors are adjusted for spatial (1,000km) and serial (3-years) correlation.
    Sample period is 1961-2017. The model also considers adaptation using a long differences
    (LD) approach, but finds no significant evidence of adaptation in beef production
    related to weather changes. Climate change projections for 2041-2060 and 2081-2100
    are based on combining regression estimates with forecasted climatic changes from
    the ACCESS-ESM1.5 global climate model (GCM), downscaled to eliminate bias.
  10: Panel data analysis from 1961 to 2017, and long difference regressions, using
    weather variation to identify causal effects of temperature and precipitation
    on beef production. Results applicable to assessing impact on global beef production,
    especially in tropical and poor countries. The projections are based on the ACCESS-ESM1.5
    model under the SSP3-7.0 scenario, using a 1981-2010 baseline.

  2: The analysis focuses on the impact of weather fluctuations on global livestock
    production, emphasizing beef, and considers adaptation only to the degree observed
    historically.
  3: The methodology does not account for adaptation; The model does not account for
    inter-seasonal changes in weather.
  4: Focuses on cattle production as a proxy for livestock production due to beef
    consumption and the multiple uses of cattle (meat, dairy, manure, hides, etc.).
  5: The study uses country-specific fixed effects to account for time-invariant prevailing
    conditions and region-specific trends to account for time-changing determinants
    of beef production.
  9: The model does not account for seasonal weather measures or the beneficial effects
    of CO2 on crop fertilization. The study acknowledges potential reversed causality
    between crop and livestock changes. The paper uses ACCESS-ESM1.5 GCM to project
    future impacts.
  10: The study acknowledges limitations regarding inter-annual trade-offs made by
    farmers and suggests short-run changes in cattle inventory may not be indicative
    of long-run changes associated with climate change.
  11: The paper acknowledges the complexity of real-world agricultural processes and
    the limitations of the model. Farmers are expected to take adaptive measures (such
    as migrating animals to cool areas) in the face of climate change, but this is
    not fully captured in the model.

    (significant at the 1% level).

    \ globally; Poorer countries see a 27% reduction versus 4% in higher-income countries;\
    \ An additional mm of annual precipitation leads to a 2.1% increase in production\
