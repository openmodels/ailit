Drivers of Risk:
  9: Climate-driven changes in tropical forests, specifically declining carbon sink
    capacity due to increasing tree mortality, rising atmospheric CO2, increasing
    air temperature, and drought.
  14: Drought, Temperature, CO2 levels, Moisture Content, Carbon Residence Time, Nitrogen
    Deposition, Biogeographic History
  15: Increasing temperatures, changes in forest dynamics (CRT), hydrological changes
    (MCWD), CO2 emissions pathways (CO2-change)
  16: Reduced mean pan-tropical sink strength decline of 0.1 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 decade-1
    and ongoing forest area losses of ~13.5 million ha yr-1
  18: Increased CO2 emissions; Deforestation; Degradation; Atmospheric chemistry changes;
    Climatic changes.
  33: Declining carbon sink in intact forests in Africa, Amazonia, and the pan-tropics.
  45: Atmospheric CO2 concentration, mean annual temperature, and drought intensity
    (quantified as maximum climatological water deficit) are considered theory-driven
    potential predictor variables for each census interval.
  47: CO2-change, MAT-change (temperature change), MCWD (Precipitation-driven dry
    season deficit)
  49: No relevant information
  54: Future environmental conditions, RCP scenarios (climate change scenarios).
  62: Changes in atmospheric CO2, Mean Annual Temperature (MAT), and Maximum Climatological
    Water Deficit (MCWD) drive changes in carbon gain in tropical forests.
  63: Changes in mean annual temperature (MAT) and maximum cumulative water deficit
    (MCWD, representing drought) are drivers of risk.
  64: "Changes in CO\u2082 concentration, Mean Annual Temperature (MAT), Max. Climatic\
    \ Water Deficit (MCWD), Canopy Foliar Nitrogen (CFN), Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD),\
    \ and Water Demand, which in turn affect carbon gains from woody production and\
    \ carbon losses from tree mortality."
  65: Long-term trends in above-ground carbon gains, losses, and the resulting net
    carbon sink in African and Amazonian tropical forest plot networks.
  66: The length of the Census Return Time (CRT) impacts carbon losses. Shorter CRT
    (CRT <77 years) are associated with increased carbon losses. Changes in the rates
    of carbon gains and losses in African tropical forests.
  69: Loss of intact forest area in Africa, Amazon, and Southeast Asia between 1980
    and 2010.
Highlights:
  9: "The carbon sink responses of Earth\u2019s two largest expanses of tropical forest\
    \ have diverged, with African forests remaining stable until recently while Amazonian\
    \ forests declined; a post-2010 increase in carbon losses in African forests suggests\
    \ asynchronous carbon sink saturation; the uptake of carbon into Earth\u2019s\
    \ intact tropical forests peaked in the 1990s."
  14: Larger modelled increase in carbon gains in Africa relative to Amazonia is driven
    by slower warming, fewer/less extreme droughts, lower forest sensitivity to droughts,
    and overall lower temperatures. Changes in carbon losses appear to be largely
    a function of carbon gains, but are also impacted by temperature-induced tree
    mortality.
  15: The carbon sink in African tropical forests is predicted to decline by 14% by
    2030. The Amazon sink is predicted to reach zero by 2035.
  16: Earth recently passed the point of peak carbon sequestration into intact tropical
    forests.
  18: Intact tropical forests' ability to sequester additional carbon is waning; the
    intact tropical forest carbon sink is set to end sooner than even the most pessimistic
    climate-driven vegetation models predict; climate change impacts in the tropics
    may become more severe than predicted.
  33: The table provides quantitative estimates of carbon sink changes over time,
    including predicted declines in the future, which affects climate change.
  47: The optimal baseline period for MAT-change is 5 years, and for CO2-change it
    is 56 years. MCWD-change was not included in the models because it showed no clear
    trend.
  49: No relevant information
  54: Future sink strength is sensitive to future environmental conditions; decline
    in sink strength is projected in both continents over the 2020s under both RCP
    scenarios.
  62: Carbon gain in tropical forests responds most strongly to changes in CO2 when
    calculated over a 56-year prior interval.
  63: Drought impacts on tree growth fade rapidly after the drought ends, and MCWD-change
    is not included in the models because there's no relationship between carbon gains
    and changes in MCWD over intervals longer than 1 year.
  64: "The study analyzes the impact of various environmental drivers on carbon gains\
    \ and losses in African and Amazonian tropical forests, finding statistically\
    \ significant relationships for some variables like CO\u2082 concentration and\
    \ MCWD, but not for others."
  65: A statistically significant negative trend between carbon residence time (CRT)
    and change in carbon losses in forest plots indicates that longer CRT is associated
    with reduced losses.
  66: Plots with CRT <77 years show a recent long-term increase in carbon losses.
    There are reported changes in the trends of carbon gains and losses between the
    periods 1985-2000 and 2000-2015.
  69: Intact forest area declined significantly between 1980 and 2010 in all regions
    studied (Africa, Amazon, and Southeast Asia).
Methodology:
  9: Analysis of carbon sink trends in 244 structurally intact African tropical forests
    spanning 11 countries compared with 321 published plots from Amazonia; statistical
    model including CO2, temperature, drought and forest dynamics.
  14: Modelled increases in carbon gains and losses in tropical forests using explanatory
    variables like CO2-change, MAT-change, MCWD, and carbon residence time (CRT)
  15: Carbon gain and loss models are used to estimate the future size of the per
    unit area intact forest carbon sink. Extrapolations of predictor variables from
    1983-2015 forward to 2040 are used.
  16: Scaling our estimated mean sink strength by forest area for each continent
  18: Analyses based on observations of inter-hemispheric atmospheric CO2 concentration
    and carbon uptake into the Northern hemisphere landmass; analysis of intact tropical
    forest carbon sink capacity.
  33: Uses plots of intact forests to measure carbon sinks. Predictions for 2010-2040
    are based on parameters from another table (Table 2, not included here) with some
    adjustments for Africa and Asia.  Area-weighted mean used for pan-tropics based
    on values from Africa, Amazonia, and Southeast Asia.
  45: Estimates were adjusted to avoid bias due to seasonal variation by rounding
    census intervals to the nearest complete year and computing interval-specific
    means for environmental predictor variables.
  47: Linear mixed effects models (lmer function in R, lme4 package) are used to assess
    the correlation of carbon gains with changes in environmental variables. The optimal
    period for calculating environmental change is determined empirically by assessing
    the correlation of carbon gains with the change in each environmental variable,
    using linear mixed effects models (lmer function in R, lme4 package). An annualised
    change is calculated as the difference between the focal and baseline period for
    a time window of 1-80 years. Model selection is performed using AIC.
  49: This paper uses statistical modelling (lme function in R) to model carbon gains
    and losses in forests based on environmental drivers like CO2, MAT (presumably
    Mean Annual Temperature), and MCWD (presumably Moisture Content Weighted Density).
    It also considers rate of change of CO2 and MAT, as well as forest attributes
    WD and CRT. The analysis accounts for plot-level random effects and continent-specific
    slopes for some variables.
  52: "Confidence intervals for predictor variables and model predictions were calculated\
    \ using 2\u03C3 for uncertainties and model predictions were adjusted accordingly."
  54: Analysis based on modified slopes, and RCP scenarios.
  62: "Linear mixed effects models used to analyze correlations between carbon gain\
    \ in tropical forest inventory plots and changes in atmospheric CO2, temperature,\
    \ or drought calculated over varying prior intervals. Akaike\u2019s Information\
    \ Criterion (AIC) used to assess model fit."
  63: The analysis uses scatter plots and linear regression to examine the relationships
    between carbon dynamics (gains and losses) and factors like carbon residence time
    and wood density. The AIC minimum is used to determine the prior interval for
    calculating MAT-change.
  64: Uses linear mixed effect models with census intervals nested within plots, weighted
    by interval length and plot area, to analyze relationships between carbon dynamics
    and environmental variables in forest inventory plots.
  65: Future values estimated from linear trends on the historical data, with confidence
    intervals calculated using the standard deviation of the mean and regression model
    slope.
  66: Breakpoint regression was used to assess the CRT length below which forest carbon
    losses increase. Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze trends in carbon
    net carbon sink, carbon gains, and carbon losses, in the periods 1985-2000 and
    2000-2015.
  69: Exponential models were fitted for each continent to calculate intact forest
    area. Intact forest area is calculated by subtracting total forest area minus
    forest regrowth.
More Notes:
  9: This paper focuses on the role of tropical forests in global carbon sequestration
    and how climate change is affecting their ability to act as carbon sinks, which
    has consequences for climate stabilization policies.
  15: This paper focuses on the carbon sink capacity of tropical forests and does
    not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level.
    The decline in carbon sink may have economic consequences through climate change,
    but this is not quantified here.
  16: The study mentions that climate-driven vegetation model simulations have not
    predicted that peak net carbon uptake into intact tropical forests has already
    been passed.
  18: "Continued on-the-ground monitoring of the world\u2019s remaining intact tropical\
    \ forests will be required to test the prediction that the intact tropical forest\
    \ carbon sink will continue to decline."
  33: The continental sink in Southeast Asia is a modest and declining contribution
    to the pan-tropical sink.
  47: The analysis is performed on forest plots, specifically in Amazonia and West
    Africa. The study finds the response of forests to CO2 is maximized at a time
    equivalent to the carbon residence time of a forest stand. ET (evapotranspiration)
    is assumed to be 100 mm month-1.
  49: The paper focuses on carbon dynamics in forests, using statistical modelling
    to understand the relationships between carbon gain/loss and environmental factors.
    While the research may be indirectly relevant to understanding climate change
    impacts, it doesn't directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at
    a national level.
  54: The paper focuses on the impact of climate change on carbon sinks in continents,
    which is indirectly related to macroeconomic and macro-fiscal outcomes.
  62: The study examines the relationship between environmental changes and carbon
    gain in tropical forests. While it provides insight into ecological impacts, it
    does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national
    level.
  64: The study focuses on the ecological impacts of climate change, specifically
    on carbon dynamics in forests, rather than directly addressing macroeconomic or
    macro-fiscal outcomes.
  66: The analysis focuses on African tropical forests. The connection to specific
    national-level macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks and adaptation costs/benefits
    is indirect and would require further analysis.
  69: Data is for intact forest area, which is total forest area less forest regrowth.
    Data for 1990, 2000, and 2007 is from another publication.

Quantitative material:
  9: Intact African tropical forests carbon sink stable for three decades to 2015,
    at 0.66 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (95% CI:0.53-0.79).
  14: MAT-change further reduced gains by 1.1% (ten times the impact in Africa)
  15: "By 2030 the carbon sink in aboveground live biomass in intact African tropical\
    \ forest is predicted to decline by 14% from the measured 2010-15 mean, to 0.57\
    \ Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (2\u03C3 range, 0.16-0.96). The Amazon sink continues to decline,\
    \ reaching zero in 2035 (2\u03C3 range, 2011-2089)."
  16: From peak pan-tropical intact forest uptake of 1.26 Pg C yr-1 in the 1990s,
    we project a continued decline reaching just 0.29 Pg C yr-1 in the 2030s (multi-decade
    decline of ~0.24 Pg C yr-1 decade-1).
  18: The intact tropical forest carbon sink weakened by ~0.17 Pg C yr-1 between the
    1990s and 2000s. In the 1990s intact forests removed 17% of anthropogenic CO2
    emissions, which declined to 6% in the 2010s. Pan-tropical weighted average per
    unit area sink strength declined by 33%, forest area decreased by 19%, and CO2
    emissions increased by 46%.
  33: Presents data on carbon sink (Mg C ha-1 yr-1) and total C sink (Pg C yr-1) for
    Africa, Amazonia, and pan-tropics across different time periods (1980-2015) and
    predictions up to 2040, with associated uncertainties.
