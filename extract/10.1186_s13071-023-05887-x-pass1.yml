Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change, land-use change, intensive transportation of humans and goods,
    urbanization, and the urban heat island effect.
  3: Ongoing climate change (facilitating range shifts and establishment), increasing
    travel and trade (driving establishment success), land-use changes, other human
    pressures on the environment.
  5: Historical events such as European colonization, the transatlantic slave trade,
    the Industrial Revolution, World War II, the intensification of intercontinental
    trade, and global warming are identified as drivers of vector species dispersal.
  7: Increase in air transport and anthropogenic environmental disturbances facilitate
    the introduction and range expansion of invasive hematophagous arthropods.
  8: Climate change increases the range of hematophagous arthropods by expanding favorable
    thermal niches.
  9: Increasing temperatures and climate change are leading to range shifts in mosquitoes
    and ticks, potentially heightening disease risks.
  10: Hematophagous arthropods' range expansion due to anthropogenic climate change,
    and warmer conditions increasing mosquito populations and biting rates.
  11: Urbanization, climate change (increasing area occupied by arthropod invaders),
    and delays in management response.
  12: Intensive monoculture and sustained use of fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides
    favor the emergence of multiple lines of resistance among pests and mosquitoes.
  14: Accelerated worldwide urbanization and interconnectivity are identified as drivers
    supporting mosquito proliferation and adaptations to human-modified environments.

Evaluation overview:
  3: Ecological, economic, and social impacts of invasive hematophagous arthropods
    (vectors of pathogens and parasites).
  5: The chart depicts the global spread of various vector species (mosquitoes, fleas,
    ticks, etc.) over time, which is relevant to understanding disease transmission
    and associated health outcomes.
  7: No relevant information
  10: The paper discusses the economic costs incurred by the spread of hematophagous
    insects and their potential impacts due to climate change, particularly focusing
    on disease vector control and outbreak response costs.
  11: Economic damages and public health impacts related to invasive hematophagous
    arthropods (mosquitoes specifically).
  14: Discusses the growing risks posed by accelerated worldwide urbanization and
    interconnectivity on the proliferation and adaptation of hematophagous arthropods
    to human-modified environments.

Highlights:
  3: Invasive hematophagous arthropods can be major vectors of pathogens and parasites,
    leading to ecological, economic, and health problems. Climate change and socioeconomic
    factors are major drivers of their spread. There is a need to compile information
    on the historical and social aspects of hematophagous arthropod invasions to inform
    policymakers.
  5: The chart highlights the role of human activities and historical events in facilitating
    the global spread of disease vectors.
  7: Human-made habitats facilitate the spread and establishment of alien mosquito
    species; significant risk from initiatives like China's Belt and Road Initiative
    in increasing invasions.
  8: Hematophagous arthropods are likely to expand their range due to climate warming,
    increasing health risks via zoonotic diseases.
  9: The lessening of thermal barriers may allow Ae. aegypti and Ixodes tick species
    to expand their range into warming temperate regions.
  10: The economic costs of controlling hematophagous arthropods could be less than
    the costs associated with outbreak responses, with a potential reduction of populations
    by up to 90% with effective control measures.
  11: Rapid response to eradicate invaders post-invasion and effective biosecurity
    control pre-invasion are significantly cheaper than dealing with accrued damages
    from mosquito-borne diseases.
  14: Highlights the importance of placing the management of hematophagous arthropods
    in a wider biodiversity context, considering multispecies well-being.

Methodology:
  5: The chart visually maps the historical dispersal routes of various vector species
    from their origin locations to new regions, connecting these movements to major
    historical events. Time is coarsely represented along the x-axis.
  7: No relevant information
  9: The analysis suggests using population dynamics and distribution assessments
    of hematophagous arthropods to predict effects of climate change on disease transmission.
  14: The paper is a review synthesizing already published and publicly available
    data and information.

More Notes:
  2: The paper suggests stronger preventative monitoring and transboundary surveillance
    measures and promotes interactions among experts from different sectors to manage
    invasive arthropods effectively.
  5: The chart uses question marks to indicate uncertain dispersal routes. The quality
    of the page is low, because the character recognition is poor.
  7: Invasive arthropods can vector diseases, with air travel and international trade
    being significant factor in their spread.
  9: The paper emphasizes the potential for latent invasive species to become problematic
    under future climate conditions due to invasion debts.
  11: The paper emphasizes the underestimation of the global economic burden associated
    with invasive hematophagous arthropods and the potential for future increases
    due to climate change.
  14: The study emphasizes knowledge gaps related to the impacts of urbanization and
    interconnectivity on the spread of disease vectors, and advocates for proactive
    disease prevention programs and social-ethnological approaches to mitigation.

    over the last 4 decades. Potential cost of aquatic and semi-aquatic invaders:
    US$ 311 billion.'

  8: An increase in global suitability for Ae. aegypti life cycle completion is predicted
    to accelerate from +1.5% per decade between 1950 and 2000 to up to +4.4% per decade
    by 2050.
  11: Management delays of 55 years for the Aedes genus have led to an additional
    cost of US$4.57 billion.
