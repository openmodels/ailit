Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increase in the number of major tropical cyclones making landfall.
  4: Changes in intensity at landfall (LI) of tropical cyclones; Increase in landfalling
    major tropical cyclones
Highlights:
  1: The annual global number of major TC landfalls has significantly increased from
    1982 to 2020, approximately doubling from four to seven annually.
  4: "Significant global changes in the number of tropical cyclones making landfall\
    \ as major storms for the period 1982\u20132020. This significant change is observed\
    \ based on the intensity at landfall, rather than the lifetime maximum over oceans."
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of global TC landfall changes using historical data from 1982 to 2020.
    Linear trend analysis and Poisson regressions are used.
  4: "Analysis of best-track data (LMI \u2265 33 m/s) from the International Best\
    \ Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) v04r00. Trend analysis and synthetic\
    \ simulations of tropical cyclone landfalls. \"Landfall\" is defined as major\
    \ landfall events with LIs of at least major intensity (\u2265 50 m s\u22121),\
    \ and landfalling storms with LMIs of at least major intensity."
More Notes:
  1: "The paper focuses on major TCs at landfall (LI \u2265 50 m s\u22121) as they\
    \ account for most TC-related damage."
  4: Larger variability of LI compared to LMI may be caused by self-weakening process
    post LMI, variable decay distance and translation speed from LMI to LI, and changes
    in vertical wind shear and thermodynamic conditions when a TC approaches coastlines.
    The observed trends can be understood as a reflection of increases in LMI and
    the inherent large variability of the decay to landfall.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Socio-economic impact from tropical cyclone landfalls.
  4: Tropical-cyclone-related damage; Socio-economic threat
Quantitative material:
  1: "The number of annual global tropical cyclone (TC) landfalls with major landfall\
    \ intensity (LI \u2265 50 m s\u22121) has nearly doubled from 1982 to 2020. The\
    \ lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) of global major landfalling TCs has been increasing\
    \ by 0.8 m s\u22121 per decade (p < 0.05)."
  4: 'LI trend: 0.3 m/s per decade, p-value = 0.69; LMI trend: 0.8 m/s per decade,
    p-value = 0.05; Ratio of annual mean TC LI to LMI trend: 0.4% per decade, p-value
    = 0.77; Period of analysis: 1982-2020; Location of LMI is on average more than
    700 km away from the coastline.'
