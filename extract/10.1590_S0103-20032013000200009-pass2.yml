Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts (temperature and precipitation changes)
  4: None explicitly mentioned; focus is on irrigation as an adaptation strategy.
  5: Climate change impacts (temperature and precipitation changes) on small agricultural
    producers.
  8: Variability of precipitation; scarcity of rainfall impacting agricultural production
  12: Climate change impacts on agricultural productivity, particularly affecting
    rain-fed (non-irrigated) agriculture.
  13: Climate change impacts, specifically rising temperatures and reduced water availability,
    especially affecting rainfed agriculture.
  14: Climate change impacts on rain-fed agriculture (sequeiro production).
Highlights:
  1: Irrigation is an effective adaptation measure for smallholder farmers.
  4: Irrigation is seen as a more profitable form of agriculture compared to dry farming.
  5: The study focuses on whether irrigation reduces the vulnerability of small agricultural
    producers to climate change, particularly in the Northeast region of Brazil.
  8: Irrigated areas were exposed to lower rainfall, especially in the summer. When
    rainfall is abundant, farmers tend to practice rainfed agriculture; however, as
    precipitation becomes scarce, there is a gradual shift to irrigated systems.
  12: Irrigation is an effective adaptation measure against climate change, leading
    to increased land value and reduced variability in land value compared to rain-fed
    agriculture. Without irrigation, land value and agricultural productivity of small
    farms are expected to decline significantly under climate change.
  13: Small producers who do not adapt may face severe negative impacts, including
    land value loss and reduced productivity, leading to rural labor market imbalances,
    increased migration, and reduced food security.
  14: Irrigation can be an effective adaptive strategy for small farmers, leading
    to increased and more stable income in the medium to long term under climate change
    scenarios. Currently, rain-fed agriculture is more profitable due to high irrigation
    implementation costs and inefficient water management.
Methodology:
  1: "Treatment effect model using Propensity Score Matching (Pareamento por Escore\
    \ de Propens\xE3o); Climate projections from the IPCC 4th Assessment Report for\
    \ 2010-2099 under different climate scenarios."
  4: Uses a Treatment Effect model with Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to assess
    the impact of irrigation on agricultural land value.
  5: Uses a kernel method to estimate a counterfactual, comparing municipalities with
    irrigation to those without but with similar characteristics. Aims to determine
    if irrigation reduces vulnerability of small producers by examining the impact
    of irrigation on land value under current and future climate conditions.
  8: The study uses a database of areas. Urban areas and areas with missing or questionable
    data are excluded. Descriptive statistics of variables are observed for irrigated
    and non-irrigated agricultural production.
  12: Simulation of land values under different climate change scenarios (A1B and
    A2) for irrigated and non-irrigated small farms. Bootstrap is used to address
    sample bias, and land value captures benefits and costs of the irrigation system.
  13: The paper builds a scenario of climate change impacts based on differentiating
    between small producers who adapt and those who do not. The time horizons studied
    in the paper as a whole are the periods 2020-2050 and 2050-2080.
  14: Analysis of factors associated with irrigation adoption in Brazil, considering
    agronomic, socioeconomic, and climatic conditions. Comparison of returns to rain-fed
    versus irrigated agriculture under current and future climate scenarios.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on smallholder farmers in Brazil and advocates for public policies
    and credit access to promote irrigation as an adaptation strategy.
  5: "The unit of observation is '\xC1reas M\xEDnimas Compar\xE1veis' (AMC), an aggregation\
    \ of municipalities used to ensure comparisons across census years. The Northeast\
    \ region is specifically considered due to its expected adverse impacts from climate\
    \ change on small producers."
  8: AMC likely means "Comparable Minimum Areas". The study focuses on the economic
    aspects of irrigation as an adaptation strategy for small farmers to climate change
    in Brazil.
  14: The study highlights the need for policies to support irrigation adoption, especially
    for small farmers, and suggests potential subsidies for production aimed at domestic
    food security.
No relevant information:
  10: This page focuses on micro-level analysis of irrigation adoption by small farmers
    in response to climate variables, not macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at
    a national level.
  17: This page primarily presents supplementary tables (Annexes) with data on greenhouse
    gas concentrations under different scenarios and correlation coefficients between
    various variables. It does not directly discuss macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes, adaptation costs/benefits, or the methodology used to connect climate
    change risks to national-level economic impacts.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Land value of smallholder farmers
  4: The impact of irrigation on the profitability of agriculture by measuring the
    effect on land value.
  5: Impact of irrigation on the value of land for irrigators.
  8: No relevant information
  12: Changes in land value (a proxy for profitability) for irrigated vs. non-irrigated
    small farms under climate change scenarios.
  13: Impacts on small agricultural producers' land value, productivity, and employment;
    potential imbalances in the rural labor market; effects on migration and food
    security.
  14: Impacts on agricultural income and potential increase in rural poverty.
Quantitative material:
  1: Irrigated smallholder land value is expected to be approximately double that
    of non-irrigated (sequeiro) land value
  4: Quantitative measures of the average effect of irrigation on the treated group's
    land value, though specific numbers are not provided on this page.
  5: 'Uses projections of temperature and precipitation for three periods: 2010-2039,
    2040-2069, and 2070-2099 to simulate climate change impacts.'
  8: The database originally contained 3,659 observations, but after exclusions the
    final database was composed of 3,123 observations.
  12: The standard deviation of land values between 2020 and 2080 under climate scenario
    A1B is 5.8 for irrigated land and 57.8 for non-irrigated land.
  13: Mentions that around 2.4 million agricultural establishments in Brazil operate
    on areas of up to 10 hectares.
  14: Estimates of losses for rain-fed agriculture are considerably large.
