Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea-level rise (SLR) and storms are impacting coastal real estate values.
  2: Key risks include sea level rise, storm risks, increased erodibility of shorelines,
    sunny-day flooding, and total inundation.
  3: Sea level rise (SLR), storm risk, and influence of competing property markets.
  4: Sea level rise (SLR) beginning at year 50, erosion, and beach nourishment.
  5: The primary driver of risk evaluated is the reduction of the beach nourishment
    subsidy from 90% to 50%, in the context of ongoing sea-level rise (SLR).
  6: Shocks include rising outside market property values and sea-level rise (SLR).
  7: Sea Level Rise (SLR).
  8: Sea Level Rise (SLR)
  9: Drivers of risk considered are erosion, sea-level rise (SLR), and storms.
  10: Climate change impacts, specifically storm risk and beach nourishment decisions.
  11: Beach width, mean sea level (MSL), storms, sea level rise (SLR) and income are
    drivers of risk.
  13: Sea level rise is implicitly captured in the risk parameters used by the agents
    to make decisions. Shoreline retreat rate is also a driver.

    being evaluated.
  2: The paper examines the impact of sea level rise (SLR) and storm risks on coastal
    property values in the U.S.

    policy interventions on coastal housing markets and property values.
  10: Simulates coastal housing markets and property values in the face of climate
    change, focusing on the user cost of housing and investor behavior.
  11: Willingness to pay to live at the beach is the outcome being evaluated. This
    is reflected in the owner rent bids.
  13: This paper evaluates the economic impacts of shoreline management decisions,
    specifically beach nourishment, on property values.
Highlights:
  1: Subsidies for coastal management, tax advantages for high-income property owners,
    and stable or increasing property values outside the coastal zone dampen the effects
    of SLR on coastal property values, but only temporarily delaying precipitous declines.
    Removing subsidies would more accurately reflect risks but could lead to gentrification.
  2: Subsidies for coastal management, such as beach nourishment, and tax advantages
    temporarily dampen SLR impacts; prices would more accurately reflect SLR risks
    without these interventions.
  3: The paper studies the evolution of coastal real estate markets, incomes, and
    shoreline management, aiming to understand mechanisms that delay the collapse
    of coastal real estate and how interventions to defend the coast influence demographic
    changes. The results suggest a policy trade-off between slowing demographic transitions
    and allowing property markets to adjust smoothly to climate risks.
  4: SLR causes a modest decline in property values initially, with a substantial
    decline taking decades to manifest. An influx of high-income agents can temporarily
    dampen the property value decline due to SLR. If agents are not allowed to flux,
    SLR translates into an immediate decline in property value. Investor market share
    declines to zero as property values decline substantially.
  5: Key outcomes include reduced property values and beach width, increased income
    tax rates for property owners, and decreased investor market share.
  6: Rising outside market values can delay impacts of SLR on property values, maintain
    property values above baseline even with SLR after 100 years, and drive investors
    out of markets.
  7: When outside markets decline, expected returns and property values plummet sharply
    and risk increases despite continued beach nourishment. High-income owners leave
    the market, investors buy real estate, and rent it to lower-income occupants.
    Demographic shift to wealthier residents despite growing climate risks is a form
    of coastal gentrification.
  8: Subsidies for beach nourishment fail to promote adaptation in the long run and
    could be maladaptive, and at best, subsidies delay downward adjustments in real
    estate markets and demographic shifts.
  9: Public investments in adaptation and risk mitigation capitalize into real estate
    prices. Federal subsidies for beach nourishment can create a bubble in coastal
    real estate markets.
  10: The model determines equilibrium house price and investor market share by considering
    agents willingness to pay.
  11: "An agent\u2019s willingness to pay is influenced by income, preferences for\
    \ coastal living and beach width. Owner agent bid prices are sorted from lowest\
    \ to highest and the investor finds a market share where it outbids the highest\
    \ owner bid price and the investor\u2019s rent bid is below all rent bids for\
    \ non-owners to ensure zero vacancy. The risk premium augments the discount rate\
    \ in the user cost framework."
  13: The proposed nourishment plan is implemented if at least 50% of resident-owner
    agents vote to nourish.
Methodology:
  1: The Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM) is developed and used to analyze the
    long-term evolution of coastal real estate markets, incorporating physical attributes
    of the coast, economic values, and dynamic risks associated with storms and flooding.
    It is applicable to the US coast.
  2: The analysis employs a coupled human-natural systems model that links real estate
    markets, coastal amenities, hazards, and policies responding to coastal changes.
  3: Agent-based model (Coastal Home Ownership Model - C-HOM) simulating a coastal
    community over a 150-year time horizon. The model includes internal dynamics and
    external forcings. A 50-year period without SLR is used as an initial period.
  4: The analysis uses a baseline model scenario to simulate outcomes for oceanfront
    and non-oceanfront properties with consideration of beach width. The baseline
    case assumes SLR begins at t=50 and continues throughout the remaining periods,
    with subsidized beach nourishment. The initial 50-year period characterizes the
    system without SLR. The model includes agent flux and sensitivity analyses found
    in supplemental materials.
  5: This is a numerical experiment comparing the baseline model with a scenario where
    the nourishment subsidy is reduced, focusing on outcomes 60 years after the onset
    of sea-level rise.
  6: Numerical experiment compares baseline model with a scenario of appreciating
    outside markets, and simulations involve comparisons of worlds with various market
    and SLR conditions.
  7: The analysis uses a coupled human-natural systems model (C-HOM) to simulate coastal
    real estate markets. The model includes beach erosion dynamics, local public finance
    decisions, storm risk, and the effects of real estate markets in other locations.
    Scenarios include constant outside markets vs. outside markets declining to 10%
    of their initial levels over 50 years after SLR begins at t=50. The applicability
    of results is for coastal communities approaching the point of inundation.
  8: Modeling the coupled human-natural system, C-HOM provides a foundation for comparing
    business-as-usual with potentially more efficient approaches to coastal management
    and the equity implications of different policy approaches.
  9: The analysis uses a coupled human-natural system model (C-HOM) that combines
    theoretical, numerical modeling, and empirical literature from economics, finance,
    nonlinear systems, and coastal processes. It incorporates an asset-price approach,
    agent-based modeling, and considers feedbacks between human and natural systems.
    The model includes heterogeneity in risk preferences.
  10: Agent-based model (C-HOM) simulating a coastal community with owner agents,
    an investor agent, and fixed housing supply. The model uses a user cost of housing
    model to determine rent and price bids. It includes beach nourishment managed
    by the community. The model is smaller than a town but larger than a census block
    group.
  11: The analysis uses a user cost framework to model agent willingness to pay based
    on factors like beach width and sea level rise. It incorporates agent heterogeneity
    through randomly drawn parameters, influenced by local market conditions and demographics,
    to model housing market dynamics and investor behavior. It abstract from short
    time-scale processes and uses a linear erosion term to represent the long-term
    erosion signal.
  13: The analysis uses an agent-based model where agents (homeowners and institutional
    investors) vote on beach nourishment plans based on a cost-benefit analysis of
    property tax increases versus property value increases. The model considers different
    nourishment intervals and a 30-year time horizon.
More Notes:
  1: The study suggests a policy tradeoff between slowing demographic transitions
    in coastal communities and allowing property markets to adjust smoothly to risks
    from climate change. The paper argues that property prices do not fully reflect
    the risks from SLR and flooding.
  2: Modeling includes interactions between physical coastal systems and economic
    behavior, accounting for coupled system dynamics and long-term SLR scenarios.
  3: Income is defined in relative terms based on US marginal income tax rates. The
    model considers exogenous forces that influence internal dynamics, including SLR,
    storm risk, and the influence of competing property markets. The model accounts
    for the combined effect of state and federal subsidies, as well as hotel and other
    tourism-related taxes. Four model scenarios explore how internal and external
    dynamics affect the coupled coastal system.
  4: The analysis considers oceanfront and non-oceanfront properties separately. Fluctuations
    in property values are more pronounced in oceanfront properties because beach
    width has more effect on property value for oceanfront homes.
  8: 'Identifies three mechanisms that contribute to the persistence of high property
    values in coastal areas vulnerable to SLR: tax advantages for high-income owners,
    arbitrage opportunities with broader markets, and policies like beach nourishment
    subsidies.'
  9: The model incorporates income as an indicator of coastal gentrification, but
    future studies might consider race. Explicit spatial modeling could characterize
    variation in elevations within the community. The paper discusses the importance
    of incorporating climate belief heterogeneity.
  10: The model simplifies by fixing the housing supply, assuming structures are rebuilt
    after storms, and abstracting away from short-term vacation rentals.
  11: The paper assumes a linear rate of increase for mean sea level.
  13: The model incorporates both oceanfront and non-oceanfront properties and their
    respective tax burdens related to nourishment. Dune building is not explicitly
    modeled. The code is available on Github.
Quantitative material:
  1: Coastal real estate appreciates faster than non-coastal real estate.
  4: Property values decline modestly when SLR begins; SLR rises 1 m over 100 years;
    barrier height relative to sea level is 1 m for the first 50 years and 0 m by
    year 150; beach nourishment is subsidized at 90% of the cost.
  5: The analysis shows quantitative outcomes such as a precipitous decline in property
    values, increased volatility in property market for oceanfront properties, and
    changes in beach width.
  6: Model simulation shows percent change in property value, beach width differences,
    change in marginal income tax rate, and investor market share changes.
  7: Model simulations show declines in property value, beach width, investor share
    of housing, expected return rate, and increases in income tax rate and risk premium
    rate when outside markets decline. These changes are shown over a 150-year period
    after the onset of SLR.
  8: Cumulative federal expenditures on beach nourishment projects have exceeded 12
    billion USD in the past century (in 2022 dollars).
  9: Mentions property value increases with proximity to shoreline, coastal wetlands,
    beach width, and beach views. Also mentions property value decreases with exposure
    to storm risk and flood hazards.
  10: Formulas for capitalization rate (Eq. 2) and user cost of housing (Eq. 3).
  11: 'Equations are presented for: beach width at a given time (bwt+1), mean sea
    level at a given time (MSLt+1), Owner agent price bid (PO,bidj,t), and willingness
    to pay (WTPj,t).'
  13: The paper uses equations to calculate the total yearly cost of loan repayment
    (TCYi), the property tax rate (TCYi), and the cost of a nourishment event (cost(t)).
    It simulates property value changes due to nourishment plans.
