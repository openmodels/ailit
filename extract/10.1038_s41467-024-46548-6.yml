Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea-level rise (SLR) and storms.
  2: Sea level rise (SLR) and storm risk are identified as major shocks impacting
    coastal real estate markets.
  3: Sea level rise (SLR), storm risk, and the influence of competing property markets.
  4: Sea level rise (SLR), erosion, beach nourishment, investor behaviour, outside
    market prices, agent flux.
  5: Sea Level Rise (SLR) and reduction in beach nourishment subsidies.
  7: Sea Level Rise (SLR) and its impact on real estate markets along the US East
    and Gulf Coasts.
  10: Climate change, specifically coastal storms and beach erosion.
Highlights:
  1: Subsidies for coastal management, tax advantages for high-income property owners,
    and stable/increasing property values outside the coastal zone dampen the effects
    of SLR on coastal property values, but this effect is temporary.
  2: Subsidies and tax advantages can dampen the effects of SLR on property values,
    though these effects are transitory and delay rather than prevent price declines.
  3: Studies the trade-off between slowing demographic transitions in coastal communities
    and allowing property markets to adjust smoothly to risks from climate change.
  4: SLR initially has a mild impact on housing risk, leading to a delayed and gradual
    decline in property values. High-income agents entering the market can temporarily
    dampen the property value decline. Property values decline immediately if high-income
    agents are not allowed to enter the market.
  5: Reducing nourishment subsidies leads to more volatility in property values and
    a precipitous decline after several decades, more pronounced for oceanfront properties.
    It causes an immediate decline in mean beach width. It increases the median owner
    income tax rate. It leads to investors owning substantially less of the housing.
  7: Coastal property values may continue to rise despite increased climate-related
    risks; this can be attributed to demographic shifts and policy interventions like
    subsidizing beach nourishment.
  10: The paper simulates the effect of climate change (coastal storms and beach erosion)
    on coastal housing markets by decomposing the numerator and denominator in Eq.
    (1) and endogenizes a subset of the individual pieces. The model also represents
    beach nourishment as an adaptation strategy.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis uses the Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM) to analyze the long-term
    evolution of coastal real estate markets.
  2: The paper uses coupled human-natural systems modeling to study interactions between
    real estate markets and the physical coastal systems, emphasizing the importance
    of modeling to inform empirical specifications and uncover mechanisms.
  3: Develops the Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM) to study the evolution of coastal
    real estate markets, incomes of residents, and shoreline management decisions
    in response to SLR over a 150-year time horizon.
  4: Model simulation of oceanfront and non-oceanfront properties under a baseline
    scenario with SLR beginning at year 50. Analysis of the case in which agents are
    not allowed to flux in to exploit arbitrage opportunities with outside markets.
  5: Numerical experiment involving model simulation differences between a baseline
    model and a scenario where the subsidy rate is cut to 50% at the onset of SLR.
  7: Modeling of coastal real estate markets coupled to physical environment changes,
    particularly focusing on the effects of SLR.
  10: Agent-based model (C-HOM) simulating a coastal housing market with owner agents,
    investor agents, and beach management by communities. The model spatial resolution
    is smaller than a town but larger than a census block group. The time horizon
    is not explicitly stated on this page.
More Notes:
  1: Removing subsidies would more accurately reflect risks from SLR but could trigger
    coastal gentrification.
  3: The model considers exogenous forces that influence internal dynamics. It also
    accounts for the combined effect of state and federal subsidies as well as hotel
    and other tourism-related taxes that are not embedded in local property tax rates.
  4: The initial barrier height is 1 m for the first 50 years, and SLR causes it to
    decrease to 0 m by year 150. The model considers the impact of subsidized beach
    nourishment. Agent flux is a mechanism through which high-income agents can enter
    the market to exploit arbitrage opportunities.
  5: The baseline scenario demonstrates that property value does not immediately reflect
    SLR risks due to the interaction of risk, investment, and income. The study also
    suggests that a 90% nourishment subsidy leads to a wide beach being maintained
    with stable nourishment frequency, attracting relatively high-income agents.
  7: The paper discusses 'coastal gentrification' and the impact of persistent natural
    amenities on high income distributions in coastal areas.
  10: The model assumes a fixed supply of housing, reflecting the built-out nature
    of many coastal communities. The model considers a risk premium (rp) parameterised
    as a function of the physical system.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Coastal property values and demographic transitions in coastal communities.
  2: The paper discusses how subsidies for coastal management, such as beach nourishment,
    can temporarily dampen the impact of sea level rise (SLR) on coastal property
    markets but do not prevent eventual price declines.
  3: Evolution of coastal real estate markets, incomes of residents, and shoreline
    management decisions.
  4: Property value decline (oceanfront and non-oceanfront), beach width, investor
    share of housing, expected rate of return on coastal real estate, marginal income
    tax rate of property owners, and risk premium for coastal real estate.
  5: Property values, beach width, marginal income tax rate of property owners, and
    investor market share.
  10: Property values are affected by storm risk.
Quantitative material:
  1: No specific quantitative estimates of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes (GDP effects,
    productivity loss, interest, inflation, budget balance, borrowing costs, public
    expenditure or revenue, ROI, NPV of nation-wide adaptation) are given on this
    page.
  3: Model scenarios explore how internal and external dynamics affect the coupled
    coastal system (Fig. 2). Model parameters are in Supplementary Table S1. The first
    scenario is a baseline simulation used to evaluate the impacts of changing external
    conditions or policy, i.e., the counterfactual to which other scenarios are compared.
    In all scenarios, the physical environment has a constant rate of shoreline erosion,
    constant storm probability, and one meter of SLR over a 100-year period.
  4: Graphs showing changes in property value, beach width, investor share, expected
    return rate, income tax rate, and risk premium over time (150 years) under a baseline
    scenario with SLR beginning at year 50. Beach nourishment is subsidized at 90%
    of the cost.
  5: The study shows the percent difference in property value, difference in beach
    width in meters, difference in income tax rate, and difference in investor market
    share under different scenarios related to nourishment subsidy cuts.
