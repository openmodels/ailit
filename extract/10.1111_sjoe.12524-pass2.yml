Drivers of Risk:
  1: Monsoon rainfall shocks (droughts and excessive rainfall)
  2: Variation in monsoon rainfall shocks (both positive and negative).
  3: Monsoon rainfall shocks, particularly regional droughts.
  5: Summer monsoon rainfall shocks at the district level
  7: Monsoon rainfall shocks are a driver of changes in wages and prices in India.
  8: Variations in monsoon rainfall (standardized)
  9: Overall monsoon rainfall variation
  10: Overall monsoon rainfall variation, spatial distribution of rainfall shocks
    (regional vs. local), timing of rainfall shocks within the monsoon season
  11: Monsoon rainfall shocks (monthly standardized rainfall, both overall and separated
    into positive and negative shocks)
  12: Negative rainfall shocks (droughts) exceeding 1.5 standard deviations below
    the norm are the primary driver of risk.
  13: Negative monsoon rainfall shocks.
  14: Local and regional rainfall shocks (Rainr,n,t), overall monsoon rainfall being
    below the district mean (Rainn,t < 0), local irrigation share (Irrig_n,t), and
    average temperature in each district during the monsoon season (Temp_n,t).
  15: Monsoon rainfall shocks (negative and positive, local and regional).
  17: Negative rainfall shock (decrease in overall standardized kharif rainfall)
  18: Negative regional rainfall shock (one-unit decrease in overall standardized
    rainfall when overall standardized rainfall is below its mean, affecting the district
    and surrounding area with a 200km radius).
  19: Negative local/regional monsoon rainfall shocks
  20: Local and regional rainfall shocks (both positive and negative).
  21: Monsoon rainfall shocks
  22: A positive regional rainfall shock impacts kharif (summer) and rabi (winter)
    crop yields and prices.
  24: Negative regional rainfall shocks.
  26: Negative local/regional rainfall shocks.
  27: Monsoon rainfall shocks
  28: Negative rainfall shocks (local and regional); Poor state of transportation
    infrastructure; Trade barriers between Indian states; Congested highways with
    poor surface quality
  30: Local and regional rainfall shocks (one standard deviation decrease when overall
    standardized rainfall is below its mean).
  31: Negative regional rainfall shocks.
  32: Negative regional rainfall shocks (drought)
  33: Monsoon rainfall shocks (both positive and negative/droughts).
Highlights:
  1: Monsoon rainfall shocks have asymmetric effects on agricultural yield in India
    (droughts have a larger negative impact than excessive rainfall has a positive
    impact); drought-induced yield losses lead to persistent wage declines and food
    price increases lasting up to five years.
  2: The paper revisits the impact of monsoon rainfall shocks using a dynamic framework
    to capture the potentially long-lasting effects arising from sluggish price and
    wage responses, distinguishing between positive and negative monsoon rainfall
    shocks to account for their asymmetric effects, and controlling for the spatial
    dimension of rainfall shocks to study the potentially moderating effects of arbitrage
    trading and migration.
  7: Monsoon rainfall in the kharif season is a crucial determinant of agricultural
    yield in India.
  8: Negative deviations in standardized rainfall reduce agricultural yield substantially,
    while rainfall above the district-mean reduces agricultural yield only slightly;
    This non-linear effect is captured by LOWESS and linear regression with a breakpoint.
  9: Agricultural yield increases at higher levels of irrigation and the non-linear
    relationship between rainfall and agricultural yield is very strong at low levels
    of irrigation, but becomes weaker at higher levels.
  10: The relationship between rainfall variability and agricultural yield is subtle
    across different irrigation levels. Regional rainfall shocks tend to arrive in
    months most crucial for crop yield.
  11: Annual agricultural yield responds more sensitively to overall rainfall variations
    in June, September, and October than to mid-season variations (July and August).
    Negative rainfall shocks have a significant negative impact on annual agricultural
    yield in all months considered (June-October).
  12: Severe negative rainfall shocks lead to a sharp decline in rice yield. Rice
    yield recovers to pre-shock levels in the year after the shock. Nominal agricultural
    wages do not appear to be initially affected.
  13: Negative monsoon rainfall shocks lead to stagnant wage growth and increased
    rice prices, with lasting impacts on income and food prices.
  15: Examines the responses of agricultural yield, wages, and food prices to different
    types of monsoon rainfall variation at different levels of irrigation. Evaluates
    the impact of state-level agricultural policy and the role of barriers to trade
    and migration. Discusses welfare implications among different demographic groups
    in rural India.
  17: The paper examines the dynamic effects of monsoon rainfall shocks on wages and
    prices in India, distinguishing between local and regional rainfall shocks and
    considering different levels of irrigation.
  18: Negative regional rainfall shocks have a substantially larger impact on agricultural
    yield (particularly at low levels of irrigation) compared to local rainfall shocks.
    This stronger impact on agricultural yield translates into a roughly proportionally
    stronger response in agricultural wages.
  19: Negative rainfall shocks significantly decrease agricultural yield, with the
    effect diminishing at higher levels of irrigation. The impact on wages declines
    with higher levels of local irrigation and is no longer significant at the 75th
    percentile.
  20: Intra-regional arbitrage trading appears efficient at reducing the exposure
    to food price fluctuations due to local circumstances. Supra-regional agricultural
    trade networks in India are still incomplete. Positive local rainfall shocks have
    no significant effects, indicating asymmetry. Positive regional rainfall shocks
    initially decline agricultural yield.
  21: Illustrates impulse responses to local and regional rainfall shocks on wages
    and prices in India.
  22: Rabi crop yields increase due to additional water supply from above-average
    monsoon rainfall in the kharif season, which leads to a decrease in harvest prices
    of kharif crops in the following year.
  24: State-year fixed effects help to isolate the impact of state-level policy interventions
    (e.g., relief programmes) from the impact of rainfall shocks; relief programmes
    may not be focused on the most affected districts with low levels of irrigation.
  27: Positive local/regional rainfall shocks impact wages and prices in India. The
    effects vary based on different levels of irrigation.
  28: Intra-regional food trade (within the district and 200 km buffer) can completely
    dampen the rise in local food prices in response to purely local negative rainfall
    shocks; Distance is a key determinant of trade in food products in India.
  30: Negative rainfall shocks lead to welfare losses (decreased purchasing power)
    for both agricultural laborers and cultivators. The magnitude of the loss varies
    with the severity and scope of the shock, the level of irrigation, and the time
    horizon. Cultivators experience larger percentage losses in the immediate aftermath
    of a regional rainfall shock, but the impact on agricultural laborers is concerning
    given their typically lower income levels.
  31: Agricultural laborers and cultivators reduce their consumption expenditures
    on staple foods to a similar extent on impact from a negative rainfall shock.
  32: Both agricultural laborers and cultivators are negatively affected by drought,
    but the impact's time profile differs; cultivators can smooth staple food consumption
    better than agricultural laborers; agricultural laborers' staple food consumption
    remains below normal for several years after a shock
  33: Monsoon rainfall shocks have asymmetric effects on agricultural yield; negative
    rainfall shocks have a larger impact than positive; short-lived yield loss after
    a regional drought elicits a persistent decline in wages and a persistent increase
    in food prices; regional droughts have important distributional consequences,
    harming agricultural laborers due to wage decline and food price increases.

Methodology:
  1: Empirical analysis using National Sample Survey data; considers asymmetry in
    rainfall effects; examines determinants of internal migration and food arbitrage
    trading.
  2: "Panel vector autoregression (VAR) based on data from 310 Indian districts over\
    \ the period 1967\u20132005 to capture the persistent effects of monsoon rainfall\
    \ shocks."
  5: The authors standardize summer monsoon rainfall at the district level using gridded
    monthly rainfall data from Willmott and Matsuura (2012). They use this standardized
    rainfall measure to identify the effects of exogenous rainfall variations on male
    wages in agriculture and the share of irrigated cultivated land. The analysis
    covers the period 1967-2005.
  7: Rainfall shocks are decomposed into orthogonal series of regional and local shocks,
    contributing 64% and 36% to overall standardized rainfall variance respectively.
  8: Uses a binned scatterplot and LOWESS regression to illustrate the effects of
    variations in monsoon rainfall on agricultural yield; also uses a linear regression
    with a break point at mean district-level rainfall.
  9: LOWESS and linear spline fitted values are added to the scatterplot to outline
    the effect of monsoon rainfall on agricultural yield; analysis controls for interaction
    effects between rainfall and irrigation.
  10: Uses scatterplots with bins, LOWESS smoothing, and linear spline fitting to
    analyze the impact of rainfall variation on agricultural yield at different irrigation
    levels; decomposes rainfall shocks spatially.
  11: Univariate regressions with district-level clustered standard errors. Separate
    regressions analyze the impact of overall rainfall, and negative/positive rainfall
    shocks separately. De-meaning at the district level.
  12: Quasi-event study using averaged raw data across districts before, during, and
    after a severe negative rainfall shock. Effects are studied within a window of
    +/- three years around the shock. The analysis focuses on rainfall shocks exceeding
    1.5 standard deviations and requires no other shocks greater than one standard
    deviation within the defined window.
  13: Panel VAR estimation using data from 310 Indian districts; Helmert transformation
    to control for unobserved heterogeneity at the district level; demeaning variables
    by state-year fixed effects.
  14: Panel VAR (Vector Autoregression) with a third-order lag (I=3), using the Andrews
    and Lu (2001) lag-length selection criterion.
  15: Panel Vector Autoregression (VAR) model using district-level data in India.
    Includes district and state-year fixed effects.
  17: Impulse responses are calculated based on local/regional rainfall shocks when
    overall standardized kharif rainfall is below its mean. Standard errors are clustered
    at the district level over a horizon of five years. Results are based on 2,952
    observations at the selected lag-length.
  18: Analysis of the responses of agricultural yield, wages, and food prices to a
    one-unit decrease in overall standardized rainfall caused by a regional rainfall
    shock when overall standardized rainfall is below its mean.
  19: Regression analysis using different subsamples based on district size and level
    of irrigation. District-level clustered standard errors are reported in parentheses.
    Significance levels are indicated.
  21: Impulse response analysis, standard errors clustered at the district level over
    a horizon of five years
  22: The analysis utilizes impulse responses within a VAR framework, with adjustments
    to the confidence intervals at the 66% level due to observations' limitations.
  24: PVAR (Panel Vector Autoregression) with national-year fixed effects is used
    to analyze the impact of negative regional rainfall shocks.
  26: Regional shock analysis based on administrative divisions using NSS regions
    instead of a 200 km distance-based measure.
  27: "The analysis examines the impact of positive local/regional rainfall shocks\
    \ on wages and prices using data from administrative divisions in India. Regional\
    \ shock is based on NSS regions (as defined in the 44th round, 1988). Con\uFB01\
    dence intervals are based on standard errors clustered at the district level over\
    \ a horizon of \uFB01ve years."
  28: Analysis focuses on the group of agricultural laborers and cultivators to assess
    welfare effects.
  30: Partial equilibrium effects of rainfall shocks on purchasing power are shown.
    The analysis considers overall standardized rainfall below its mean. It assesses
    the impact on agricultural laborers and cultivators separately. The applicability
    is in settings that resemble the specific Indian agricultural context examined
    by the paper, as implied by the text.
  31: Estimation of endogenous response in consumption expenditures using individual-level
    consumption data from the NSS (National Sample Survey Organisation) combined with
    NSS region rainfall shocks, covering the time period 1989-2006.
  32: Regression analysis using NSS region level data matched to agricultural years,
    including NSS region and year fixed effects; Robust standard errors used for confidence
    intervals
  33: Dynamic approach to capture lasting effects arising from sluggish price and
    wage responses in agricultural markets; distinguishes between positive and negative
    rainfall shocks and explicitly considers their spatial dimension (local/regional).
More Notes:
  1: Affiliation to the same National Sample Survey region is a key determinant of
    internal migration; distance appears more relevant for food arbitrage trading.
  8: The non-linear relationship between rainfall and agricultural yield is attributed
    to the relationship between water supply and plant growth, where additional water
    beyond the maximum water demand of a certain plant has zero effect.
  9: The paper shows that the relationship between rainfall and agricultural yield
    is non-linear and is affected by irrigation levels.
  10: The study examines how regional and local rainfall shocks affect food prices
    and wages, allowing inference on the extent to which adverse effects can be mitigated
    by arbitrage trading and migration. The study references the importance of late
    Kharif season rainfall on crop yield.
  11: Coefficients for 'negative rainfall' can be interpreted as the effect of a one-unit
    decrease in overall standardized rainfall. The relative contribution of regional
    rainfall to overall standardized rainfall variability is a linear transformation
    of the coefficient of determination.
  13: The effects of monsoon shocks on agricultural wages are close to permanent.
  15: The stability condition of the panel VAR is satisfied (eigenvalues lie inside
    the unit circle). Sensitivity analysis is performed by excluding controls for
    irrigation share and/or the spatial dimension of rainfall variation.
  17: The analysis focuses on kharif rainfall.
  19: The arbitrage mechanism through (both intra- and supra-regional) migration is
    relatively weak.
  20: The study focuses on the effects of rainfall shocks on agricultural yield, wages,
    and food prices. Elasticities to negative rainfall shocks are two to three times
    larger than symmetric estimates in other studies.
  21: The analysis is based on standardized Kharif rainfall when it is above its mean,
    and the effects are presented for different levels of irrigation.
  27: The study focuses on the impact of positive rainfall shocks.
  28: The analysis considers the impact of cross-subsidization between freight and
    passenger services pushing up freight costs; one-third of Indian villages are
    not connected by all-season roads.
  30: The analysis assumes a 73% income share spent on food. The paper acknowledges
    potential limitations related to income shares spent on staple food and substitution
    towards expensive varieties.
  31: The partial equilibrium exercise likely underestimates (overestimates) the adverse
    impact on the purchasing power of agricultural labourers (cultivators). The study
    focuses on cultivators who own or control less than 3 ha of land.
  32: The study suggests a large fraction of agricultural laborers are credit-constrained
    'hand-to-mouth' consumers, unable to insure against income fluctuations.
  33: Irrigation dampens the fall in agricultural wages after a regional drought,
    but not the rise in food prices; Government support to affected individuals should
    be spread over several years due to lasting effects on real incomes.
