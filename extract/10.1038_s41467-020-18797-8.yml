Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature variability
  2: "Annual global mean temperature (GMT) anomaly, \u0394T, and variability in global\
    \ temperature."
  3: The drivers of risk include aleatory (inherent variability) and epistemic (model
    parameter) uncertainties, with scenarios including RCP8.5, 6.0, 4.5, and 2.6 pathways.
  4: Temperature variability and the interaction of aleatory and epistemic uncertainties
    are identified as key risk drivers.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Economic cost of climate change
  2: Economic damages from climate change, measured as a share of global annual output.
  3: The paper evaluates climate damages with both deterministic and stochastic temperature
    models, detailing risk premiums that a social planner would pay to eliminate temperature
    variability.
  4: The analysis highlights economic damages from climate change due to temperature
    variability and autocorrelation in climate models.
Highlights:
  1: Even modest variability implies trillions of dollars of previously unaccounted
    for economic damages.
  2: Adding realistic temperature variability creates substantial uncertainty in future
    damages, equivalent to trillions of dollars of previously unaccounted for economic
    costs of climate change. The benefits of adaptation are much greater than previously
    believed. Official assessments of climate damages rely on deterministic models,
    omitting uncertainty.
  3: Risk premiums for variability are substantial, with amounts up to over half of
    current global output under certain scenarios; aleatory uncertainty greatly increases
    costs when mixed with epistemic uncertainty.
  4: The inclusion of temperature variability in models reveals trillions of dollars
    in previously uncounted economic damages.
Methodology:
  1: Accounts for aleatory uncertainty (irreducible uncertainty that remains even
    when true parameter values are known) in a physically well-founded and tractable
    way
  2: Uses a stochastic model (equation provided) to represent the behavior of global
    mean temperatures (GMTs) over time. Calibrates model parameters to historical
    data. Compares results to a deterministic model.
  3: The analysis uses deterministic and stochastic temperature models, evaluating
    damages through temperature trajectories with different RCP pathways and calculating
    risk premiums using a 4.25% discount rate.
  4: Risk premia calculated using deterministic and stochastic energy balance models
    under different RCP scenarios with a log-normally distributed ECS.
More Notes:
  2: The risk premium represents the value of insurance against aleatory uncertainty
    about future temperatures.
Quantitative material:
  1: Trillions of dollars of previously unaccounted for economic damages
  2: "Deterministic model forecasts $486 trillion in total damages for RCP8.5, stochastic\
    \ model assigns a 5% chance to damages exceeding $563 trillion. 5\u201395% range\
    \ for the stochastic model is (\u221213%, +16%) of the deterministic forecast\
    \ for RCP8.5, and (\u221230%, +52%) of the deterministic forecast for RCP2.6 ($30\
    \ trillion)."
  3: Risk premiums are quantified for different RCP scenarios, such as $3 trillion
    for RCP2.6 and up to $32 trillion for RCP8.5, expressed as percentages of current
    global output (e.g., 4% for RCP2.6, 40% for RCP8.5).
  4: Risk premia quantified, showing values in trillions of USD under different RCP
    scenarios, e.g., 46 trillion USD for RCP8.5.
