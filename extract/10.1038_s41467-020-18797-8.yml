Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature variability (aleatory uncertainty)
  2: The interaction of aleatory and epistemic uncertainty magnifies economic costs
    of climate change.
  3: "Global mean temperature anomaly (\u0394T), RCP scenarios (Representative Concentration\
    \ Pathways), epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty about model parameters like equilibrium\
    \ climate sensitivity (ECS)), aleatory uncertainty (inter-annual temperature variability)."
  4: Aleatory uncertainty (inherent randomness) and epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty
    due to incomplete knowledge, specifically regarding Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity
    - ECS) related to climate change, temperature variability.
Highlights:
  1: Modest temperature variability implies trillions of dollars of previously unaccounted
    for economic damages.
  2: Stochastic models reveal substantial uncertainties in climate damages, with significant
    potential for unaccounted economic costs.
  3: Risk premia are substantially higher due to the interaction of epistemic and
    aleatory uncertainty; Epistemic uncertainty about the climate's response magnifies
    the cost of inter-annual and multi-decadal variability; Risk premia represent
    anywhere from 6 to 13% in additional damages relative to the projections of the
    deterministic model.
  4: Adding temperature variability to integrated assessment models results in greater
    economic damages from climate change. The interaction between aleatory and epistemic
    uncertainty can lead to significant additional costs (risk interaction effect)
    because a high draw from the ECS distribution produces both greater mean warming
    and greater variability.
Methodology:
  1: Physically well-founded and tractable way to account for aleatory uncertainty
    in climate-economy models
  2: The analysis extends standard deterministic models by incorporating stochastic
    behavior of global mean temperatures and its impact on economic damages.
  3: Deterministic and stochastic climate-economy model, ensembles of 10,000 temperature
    trajectories, discount rate of 4.25%; Calculations based on difference between
    the expected utility of the deterministic trajectory and that of the ensemble
    of stochastic trajectories; Risk premium calculated as the additional cost of
    living with aleatory uncertainty compared to a deterministic world.
  4: Uses a deterministic Energy Balance Model (EBM) to generate temperature trajectories
    based on a distribution of Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) values. Compares
    expected utility of damages between ensembles with and without aleatory uncertainty
    to calculate risk premia. The ECS is assumed to be log-normally distributed.
More Notes:
  1: The paper argues that current assessments underestimate economic damages from
    climate change by failing to account for aleatory uncertainty.
  2: The risk premium is highlighted as a measure of the cost of uncertainty, representing
    the value of avoiding an uncertain future.
  3: The paper distinguishes between risk premia (additional cost of aleatory uncertainty)
    and the social cost of carbon (SCC, cost of releasing an additional tonne of CO2).
  4: High discount rates are acknowledged as potentially leading to conservative damage
    estimates. The study suggests that the benefits of adaptation are much greater
    than previously believed. The model's handling of temperature autocorrelation
    is another potential source of conservative estimates, as it doesn't fully capture
    long-range dependence (the 'Joseph effect'). The risk premium tells us about the
    costs that we need to prepare for because they cannot be avoided through abatement
    and suggests that adaptation measures are most likely required.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic damages from climate change
  2: Total economic damages from climate change are estimated, with a focus on the
    variance between deterministic and stochastic models, including higher potential
    damages with stochastic models.
  3: Global economic damages in Trillion USD, risk premium as a percentage of current
    global output, willing to pay to avoid inter-annual temperature variability in
    Trillion USD and as a percentage of current global output.
  4: Economic damages from climate change, measured as risk premia in Trillions of
    USD.
Quantitative material:
  1: Trillions of dollars of previously unaccounted for economic damages
  2: The deterministic model forecasts $486 trillion in total damages under RCP8.5,
    while stochastic models show damages with a 5% chance of exceeding $563 trillion,
    a 16% increase.
  3: Under RCP2.6, damages of $3Tr, risk premium of 4% of current global output; Under
    RCP8.5, damages of $32Tr, risk premium of 40% of current global output; With epistemic
    uncertainty, under RCP2.6, willing to pay $9Tr to remove aleatory uncertainty;
    With epistemic uncertainty, under RCP8.5, willing to pay $32Tr to remove aleatory
    uncertainty.
  4: 'Risk premia estimates under different RCP scenarios: RCP8.5: 32Tr (Aleatory-only),
    14Tr (Aleatory x Epistemic risk interaction effect), 46Tr (Total). RCP6.0: 15Tr,
    16Tr, 31Tr. RCP4.5: 9Tr, 16Tr, 25Tr. RCP2.6: 3Tr, 6Tr, 9Tr. These values represent
    what a social planner would be willing to pay to avoid aleatory uncertainty.'
