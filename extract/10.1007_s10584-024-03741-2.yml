Drivers of Risk:
  3: No relevant information
  6: No relevant information
  7: Climate change effects on land or ocean resources; Sea level change, ocean warming
    and acidification, weather extremes (storms, cyclones) and sea ice loss; Water-related
    hazards (floods and droughts) and water quality deterioration; Extreme events
    leading to the breakdown of physical infrastructure and networks providing critical
    goods and services; Armed conflict as well as risks to low-agency human mobility
    within and across state borders, including the potential for involuntarily immobile
    populations
  11: Hazard exposure, pre-existing vulnerabilities, lack of coping capacity (infrastructural,
    institutional, and social). The risk of future hazards and exposure. Shocks impacting
    the population at risk and their capacity to cope.
  13: Risks to water security, food security, and human health are prioritized due
    to their potential to destabilize society at large.
Highlights:
  6: No relevant information
  11: People-centred criteria are predominantly the top criteria. The interplay between
    people-centred criteria, risk, and vulnerability is crucial. The most essential
    criteria could depend on the expected timewise sequence of interventions and disasters.
  13: The analysis emphasizes the importance of prioritizing funding for water and
    food security, identified as crucial for societal stability.
  14: The panel had a strong consensus on the ranking of priorities, as indicated
    by parametric measures (SD, Pearson's r).
Methodology:
  3: The study explores priority preferences for humanitarian aid and disaster management
    funding allocation using a Delphi panel of international experts, based on IPCC
    AR6 and INFORM decision-making indices.
  5: Experts prioritize funding preferences using a 4-point scale from low to high
    priority instead of typical Likert scale.
  6: "The study uses a panel of experts to prioritize risk factors related to climate\
    \ change using a 4-point scale in two rounds (R1 and R2) of surveys. The prioritization\
    \ focuses on criteria from the INFORM Climate Change Risk and INFORM Severity\
    \ suite. For Q2, the eight representative key risks (RKR) from IPCC\u2019s WG2\
    \ contribution to AR6 are taken as a thematic baseline."
  7: Survey of a panel of experts to prioritise climate change risks from low to high
    using a 4-point scale; Analysis of initial survey results (R1) provided to panellists
    to inform further deliberation in round 2 (R2); Minor amendments to question titles
    and descriptions, merging of equivalent question items, and formation of one new
    criterion between rounds.
  11: Expert panel assessment based on a survey with free-text justifications. Analysis
    is conducted in two rounds (R1 and R2) and the results are timeframe-dependent
    (short-term vs long-term focus).
  13: Prioritization is based on panelists' assessments of immediate and cascading
    risks, incorporating qualitative synthesis of free-text comments.
  14: A Delphi panel method was used to determine priorities for allocating scarce
    public resources to adapt and counter losses and damages related to climate change.
    Standard deviation (SD) was used as the leading consensus indicator. Pearson correlation
    coefficient was used to measure how stable or similar the panel's answers were
    between rounds.
More Notes:
  3: The paper highlights the increasing need for humanitarian and disaster aid due
    to climate change and aims to provide a framework for equitable resource allocation.
  6: The study focuses on identifying and prioritizing climate change risks for humanitarian
    aid and disaster management resource allocation, rather than directly quantifying
    macroeconomic or fiscal impacts or adaptation costs and benefits.
  11: The definition of risk should capture all the vulnerabilities. Risk is naturally
    irrelevant if the disaster has already happened (excluding residual risk) or the
    impact projection is reliable. Analysis includes consideration of forecast-based
    funding or anticipatory action, early action funding or post-disaster response.
  12: This page focuses on humanitarian and disaster aid funding priorities for climate
    change adaptation, not macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes directly.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: No relevant information
  6: No relevant information
  7: Economic impacts across scales, including impacts on GDP, poverty and livelihoods,
    as well as the exacerbating effects of impacts on socio-economic inequality between
    and within countries
  11: People-centred criteria, such as the number of people affected by disasters,
    are highly prioritized; saving lives and livelihoods.
