Drivers of Risk:
  1: Variation of weather variables (temperature).
  2: Annual variation of weather variables, particularly temperature and precipitation.
  3: Temperature and precipitation changes (weather variables).
  4: Weather shocks impact economic outcomes.
  5: Monthly temperature and precipitation anomalies (1951-2014), future climate change
    projections based on RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios
  6: Temperature is a driver of risk, impacting the economic outcomes.
  7: Temperature, precipitation
  8: Temperature change; Precipitation; Poverty (interaction with temperature)
  9: Temperature and precipitation, and their interaction with poverty levels.
  10: Temperature deviations from historical norms and variations in precipitation
    impact agricultural productivity and GDP per-capita growth.
  11: Temperature change (global warming) under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
  12: Climate change, specifically temperature changes under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
  13: Temperature change (global warming)
  14: Temperature change under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios.
  15: Temperature change (projected).
  16: Deviations in average temperature and precipitation (both positive and negative)
    from historical norms (30-year moving averages)
  17: Persistent increases in temperatures based on RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
Highlights:
  1: Considerable model uncertainty exists. Temperature has statistically significant
    effects on both GDP and agricultural production. Future climate change is projected
    to have slight average effects on GDP per capita but cause important losses in
    agriculture.
  2: The non-linear (quadratic) in temperature levels model performs best in econometric
    tests, suggesting a small and insignificant effect on GDP per capita at aggregated
    level but significant losses in agricultural GVA.
  3: Model specification matters greatly for long-run projections of climate damage.
  4: Estimated coefficients in the panel fixed-effects model capture a weighted average
    of long-term and short-term response functions, with a significant tendency to
    capture long-term effects if time-series variation in weather is small.
  5: Non-linear and concave-in-temperature relationship between economic outcomes
    and temperature, with a maximum around 12-14 degrees Celsius; agriculture is more
    sensitive to temperature than overall GDP
  6: Models including linear time trends perform poorly. DJO1 and NPS specifications
    are equivalent in terms of out-of-sample prediction accuracy for GDP per capita.
    For agricultural productivity, DJO1 and NPS specifications display the lowest
    RMSE.
  7: There is difficulty in discriminating between growth vs level models or between
    linear vs non-linear models in out-of-sample prediction, suggesting the existence
    of model uncertainty for Italian data. The linear temperature specification in
    growth rate is rejected by the data.
  8: A non-linear (quadratic in temperature) model in first differences performs better
    econometrically than linear growth models for GDP estimation. The optimal temperature
    for maximizing GDP is estimated at 17.5 degrees C (14.2, 20.9) degrees C with
    95% confidence range. Temperature increases reduce agricultural labor productivity
    in poor provinces.
  9: Temperature and precipitation have statistically significant effects on GVA per-worker.
    The effect of temperature and precipitation can be different in poor provinces.
  10: Temperature deviations have significant negative impacts on long-term economic
    growth and agricultural productivity, especially in poorer regions, with robust
    results in temperature deviation impacts for 'poor' provinces.
  11: Temperature projections under RCP 8.5 for some Southern provinces exceed historical
    data, so projections are done with and without capping the temperature at the
    historical maximum.
  12: Climate change is projected to have heterogeneous impacts across Italian provinces,
    with potential gains in the North and losses in the South. The agricultural sector
    is particularly vulnerable. Model selection is uncertain, but non-linear level
    models in first differences are favored.
  13: Global warming in Italy will disproportionally affect regions that are more
    vulnerable to weather variability due to their dependence on agriculture and lower
    development level. Important productivity losses in agriculture concentrated in
    the Centre and especially in Southern provinces.
  14: Temperature changes under RCP8.5 are projected to have more severe negative
    impacts on per-capita GDP and agricultural GVA per-worker than under RCP4.5, especially
    in Southern Italy.
  15: The NPS model has the lowest Backcast RMSE for Agr. GVA per-worker when no province-time
    trends are included.
Methodology:
  1: Panel of 110 provinces observed between 1980 and 2014. Explores to what extent
    these economic outcomes are affected by weather variables, linearly or non-linearly,
    as well as how their growth rate and levels are affected as a result. The most
    robust econometric results showing statistically significant effects of temperature
    for both the GDP and agricultural reaction function are from a levels specification,
    where temperature is included in a non-linear form while weather variables and
    economic outcomes enter in first differences.
  2: Modern panel data econometrics exploiting inter-annual variation of weather variables
    to study their impact on economic outcomes at NUTS3 level in Italy from 1980 to
    2014.
  3: Compares different regression model specifications to explain the impact of weather
    variables on the Italian economy; Uses cross-validation (forecast CV, backcast
    CV, and k-fold CV) to select the best-performing model based on RMSE.
  4: Analysis exploits Italian NUTS3 provinces' data from 1980 to 2014 and utilizes
    a panel fixed-effects model with a quadratic in weather variables specification.
  5: Anomaly method for weather data, high-resolution temperature data from COSMO-CLM
    regional circulation model forced by CMCC-CM global climate model, Downscaling
    of modelled scenarios using observed records, flexible fractional polynomial regression
    to examine the relationship between economic outcomes and temperature, cross validation
    exercises to assess model performance
  6: The analysis uses Fractional Polynomial (fp) regression and forecast cross-validation
    (CV) to evaluate out-of-sample prediction accuracy of different models. Forecast
    CV uses five training windows (1981-1990, 1981-1995, 1981-2000, 1981-2005, 1981-2010)
    and tests on periods following the training window (5 years each).
  7: The paper uses various econometric models (linear and non-linear specifications
    like DJO1, DJO2, BHM, NPS, KAHN) to analyze the relationship between weather variables
    and economic outcomes. It uses out-of-sample forecasting and cross-validation
    techniques (k-fold CV) to compare model performance. Welch t-tests are used to
    formally test for differences in RMSE. The models are estimated using Italian
    data, with standard errors clustered by province and region-year to account for
    spatial correlation.
  8: Panel data regressions with country-level data.  Uses both linear and quadratic
    specifications for temperature.  Includes precipitation controls. Employs robust
    standard errors clustered within NUTS3. Calculates maximizing GDP growth temperatures
    through bootstrapping.
  9: Panel regressions are performed using different specifications (DJO, BHM, NPS)
    and functional forms (linear, quadratic, growth, levels) to estimate the impact
    of temperature and precipitation on GVA per-worker. Robust standard errors are
    clustered within NUTS3 regions and region-year.
  10: The analysis uses non-linear growth models such as DJO and BHM, and the ARDL
    model of Kahn et al. (2019), employing estimators like the XTSPJ estimator.
  11: A model is used where the evolution of per-capita GDP (or GVA per-worker) is
    based on the previous year's value plus an economic growth rate without temperature
    change, plus a temperature-induced variation. The temperature-induced variation
    uses a non-linear relationship (NPS specification).
  12: Econometric analysis at the provincial level in Italy, using both growth and
    level models with linear and non-linear specifications. Model selection based
    on cross-validation and econometric tools. Focus on model uncertainty and within-country
    heterogeneity in climate.
  13: Uses COSMO-CLM model projected temperatures. Employs NPS econometric results
    (Table 4, column 5 for GDP and Table 5, column 5 for agricultural GVA). Uses both
    point estimates and 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. Distinguishes between
    temperature bounded and unbounded to the maximum historical distribution for agricultural
    GVA projections.
  14: NPS econometric results are used to project the impacts. The study employs non-linear
    panel methods, acknowledging they likely capture a mix of short- and long-run
    effects.
  15: Econometric modelling (specifically using models denoted as DJO1, DJO2, BHM,
    NPS, KHAN1, KHAN2) to project the effect of temperature change on per-capita GDP
    in Italy; Backcast Cross-Validation and K-fold Cross-Validation used to assess
    model performance.
  16: Panel data regressions (xtreg and xtspj) with country fixed effects and country-specific
    trends, using K-fold cross validation with Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for
    model selection. Xtreg is a fixed effects model, xtspj is the half-panel jackknife
    fixed effects estimator of Chudik et al. (2018).
  17: Estimates based on Kahn et al. (2019) using econometric coefficients from XTSPJ
    specifications and GDP weighted averages at the province level.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on Italy.
  2: Projection for the year 2100 under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios shows significant
    geographic heterogeneity in effects.
  3: The study focuses on static and dynamic panel data models, including autoregressive
    distributed lag (ARDL) models. The models include province and time fixed effects,
    and province-specific time trends.
  5: Data is from Italian provinces at NUTS3 level; Uses Cambridge Econometrics' Regional
    Database based on Eurostat for economic variables; Focuses on linearity vs. non-linearity
    and growth vs. levels effects of weather variables on economic outcomes.
  6: Backcast CV results (reported in Table A.1 in the Appendix) closely mimic the
    forecast CV results.
  7: The paper tests for heterogeneity with respect to income by interacting weather
    variables with a 'poor' dummy variable. Weather variables (temperature and precipitation)
    explain a small fraction of GDP growth (0.89%-1.02%) and GVA per-worker growth
    in agriculture (2.96%-4.19%).
  8: The paper compares its findings to other global studies (Newell et al., 2021)
    and discusses the implications for Italy. It emphasizes the importance of sub-national
    analysis. The temperature effect is significant when two-way clustered standard
    errors are considered. It also shows that a level specification for agricultural
    labor productivity is preferred.
  9: The study considers both linear and non-linear (quadratic) effects of temperature
    and precipitation. The analysis controls for temperature when estimating precipitation
    effects, and vice versa.
  11: Climate projections are based on one (high resolution) climate model and thus
    should be considered with caution; however, uncertainty due to the estimated reaction
    function and sampling uncertainty are higher than climatic model uncertainty.
    The approach to aggregating NUTS3 impacts is considered conservative.
  12: The study highlights the importance of accounting for within-country climate
    heterogeneity when assessing the economic impacts of climate change. Results are
    sensitive to modeling choices.
  13: The results suggest within country climate heterogeneity matters. Climate change
    can affect the Italian economy through channels different from the agricultural
    sector. Policies may be required to mitigate the impact of climate change on certain
    vulnerable agricultural sectors, such as specific agricultural practices that
    can be climate adapted
  14: The authors acknowledge model uncertainty and caution interpreting the size
    of future climate change impacts. The analysis focuses on historical data and
    might not capture extreme events outside this range. The paper suggests a policy
    mix that fosters the growth of economic activities other than agriculture in the
    Southern regions.
  15: The models' sensitivities to modelling choices are mentioned; Figure A.1 visually
    shows the projected effect of temperature change on per-capita GDP in Italy with
    confidence intervals. Different specifications including whether temperatures
    are bounded or unbounded to historical distribution.
  16: The models include lagged dependent variables. The analysis uses data for 110
    provinces over 31 years (N x T = 3410).
