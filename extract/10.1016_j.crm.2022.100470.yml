Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea level rise (SLR) along the Caribbean and Pacific coastlines of Colombia under
    different climate change scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5).
  2: Rising sea levels and increased occurrence of extreme events impacting coastal
    areas.
  4: Sea level rise (SLR) driven by different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)
    representing various emission scenarios and climate futures.
  5: Sea Level Rise (SLR) according to IPCC scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5,
    SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5).
  6: Sea level rise (SLR) is identified as a risk factor, particularly affecting areas
    within 1 km of the coastline.
  7: Potential land loss due to sea level rise (SLR) under SSP5-8.5 climate scenario
    impacting 12 departments and 86 municipalities.
  8: Sea level rise (SLR) leading to the need for population reallocation; High poverty
    indicators and informal labor rates impacting policy implementation and tax collection.
Highlights:
  1: Sea level rise threatens an area of 2840.64 km2 in Colombia under the worst-case
    scenario (SSP5-8.5), impacting 12 departments or 86 municipalities.
  2: 'Three aspects analyzed: land loss potential, land use assessment of threatened
    areas, socio-economic impact of SLR and land loss on local population.'
  4: Projects SLR for Buenaventura and Cartagena under various SSP scenarios, showing
    significant differences in potential SLR depending on the emission pathway. SSP5-8.5
    consistently projects the highest SLR.
  5: The Caribbean Sea coastline will experience a higher SLR than the Pacific Ocean
    coastline.
  6: The economic sectors of areas near coastlines are particularly vulnerable to
    SLR. 'Water bodies' are identified as the land type most affected by SLR, followed
    by other unspecified land types. Agriculture (A) and Construction (E) saw an increase
    from 2019 to 2020, whereas mining (B) reduced its share.
  7: Identifies departments and municipalities at risk of land loss due to SLR, along
    with population and GDP per capita. The Caribbean coastline is expected to experience
    greater impacts. Agriculture, livestock, hunting, forestry and fishing represent
    almost 10% of the national GDP and is threatened by sea level rise.
  8: Sea level rise will disproportionately affect vulnerable ethnic groups and populations
    with high rates of informal labor, making adaptation policies more challenging
    and expensive.
Methodology:
  1: Uses sea level rise projections published in August 2021 by the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change in the Sixth Assessment Report to identify area at risk
    of land loss; Examines five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) for the 21st
    century.
  2: Analysis using IPCC scenarios to determine land loss due to sea level rise; assessment
    of current land use in threatened areas; socio-economic discussion on SLR impact.
  4: "Uses the NASA Sea Level Projection Tool based on IPCC 6th Assessment Report\
    \ data to project SLR under different climate scenarios. Analyzes 'science-ready'\
    \ data from PSMSL \u2013 GLOSS and fast delivery data from UHSLC for tide gauge\
    \ stations."
  6: The analysis calculates the area under risk of permanent land loss due to SLR
    within 1 km of the coastline of the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The authors
    use data from DANE (2020b) to determine GDP percentages by economic activity and
    land use data.
  7: Estimates the population and GDP per capita in departments potentially affected
    by SLR based on existing data (DANE, 2020a, 2020b).
More Notes:
  1: The paper determines the land use in the affected zones.
  4: "The analysis uses data from specific tide gauge stations and focuses on sea\
    \ level projections. The paper relates SSPs with radiative force levels. The projections\
    \ are relative to a 1995\u20132014 baseline."
  6: The paper focuses on the potential impacts of sea-level rise on specific departments
    within Colombia. The supplementary materials contain additional detailed data
    used in the analysis. The information is limited to 2019 and 2020 GDP breakdowns.
    The pie charts show a very slight shift in the relative contributions of each
    sector between 2019 and 2020.
  8: The paper highlights the importance of considering the socio-cultural value of
    ethnic territories when planning for climate change adaptation, particularly population
    reallocation.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Socio-economic implications in regions affected by projected sea level rises;
    Impact on different social, environmental, economic, and cultural conditions along
    the coastline of Colombia.
  4: No relevant information
  5: Potential land loss due to sea level rise (SLR).
  6: GDP by branch of economic activity at the department level.
  7: GDP per capita in departments at risk of land loss due to sea level rise (SLR).
  8: Increased complexity and cost of adaptation (specifically, population reallocation)
    due to ethnic diversity and poverty.
Quantitative material:
  1: Sea level rise of 1.04 m in the worst-case scenario (SSP5-8.5) would threaten
    an area of 2840.64 km2; Impact on 12 departments or 86 municipalities.
  4: Presents projected sea level rise (SLR) in meters from 2020 to 2150 for Buenaventura
    and Cartagena under SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios.
    Provides 17th-83rd percentile ranges, reflecting uncertainty. The corresponding
    tabulated values are reported in Table SM.1.
  5: 'Area at risk on Caribbean coast: 1748 km2 (SSP1-1.9), 2232 km2 (SSP5-8.5). Area
    at risk on Pacific coast: 316 km2 (SSP1-1.9), 609 km2 (SSP5-8.5).'
  6: Table 1 presents the percentage of GDP contributed by different branches of economic
    activity for various departments. Fig. 6 shows GDP by branch of economic activity
    for the years 2019 and 2020.
  7: "Table 2 lists the population (2018) in municipalities at potential risk of land\
    \ loss due to SLR and GDP per capita by department within the at-risk area. Examples:\
    \ Antioquia (371,321 inhabitants, 5,898 USD GDP per capita), Atl\xE1ntico (2,001,531\
    \ inhabitants, 4,343 USD GDP per capita)."
  8: Almost 40% of the population in Choco and Guajira live in indigenous reservations
    or CCN territory. Informal labor rates in Choco and La Guajira are 92% and 93%
    respectively, with other affected departments having rates higher than 50%.
