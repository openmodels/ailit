Highlights:
  1: Increased demand for green firms would benefit long-term investors, banks, and
    passive investment advisors at the expense of hedge funds and small-active investment
    advisors.
  3: Substantial heterogeneity in demand curves of institutional investors both within
    and across groups.
  5: foreign investors help to lower the cost of capital for green firms in the US,
    conditional on the other characteristics
  12: The valuation impact of an investor depends on its size, heterogeneity in demand
    elasticities, and differences in the investor's demand for characteristics and
    latent demand.
  13: The paper focuses on pricing the largest firms in the economy.
  15: "The study classifies investors into eight groups: Investment Advisors \u2013\
    \ Large-Passive, Investment Advisors \u2013 Small-Passive, Investment Advisors\
    \ \u2013 Small-Active, Investment Advisors \u2013 Large-Active, Hedge Funds, Long-Term,\
    \ Private Banking, Brokers, and Households. FactSet data on investor location\
    \ is used to study differences between domestic and foreign investors."
  16: Sustainalytics environmental ratings are industry-adjusted and an important
    driver of flows, and the entrenchment index is used as an additional characteristic.
  19: No relevant information
  22: Estimates are robust to varying the window of past stock holdings used to define
    the investment universe.
  23: "Demand elasticity estimates are robust to varying the window to estimate the\
    \ investment mandate. Excluding hedge funds in the construction of the instrument\
    \ for market equity results in highly correlated estimates compared to the benchmark.\
    \ Corporate policy shocks, \u03BDxt (n), are assumed to be independent of latent\
    \ demand. Investors\u2019 demand can be estimated in two steps."
  24: The estimates are robust to certain endogeneity forms, and the influence of
    a firm's dividend policy on valuation ratios is relatively small.
  25: There is significant heterogeneity in demand elasticities across investors.
    Stronger demand for firms with higher environmental scores is found for large
    investment advisors and brokers. Hedge funds and small-active investors have the
    most elastic demand curves, while large investment advisors, brokers, and long-term
    investors have the most inelastic demand.
  27: "This paper endogenizes the distribution of assets, allowing exploration of\
    \ the impact on investors\u2019 assets and a measure of welfare."
  28: Small-active investment advisors and hedge funds have the largest impact on
    prices. Hedge funds play an outsized role in mispricing per dollar of AUM. Long-term
    investors and passive investment advisors have the smallest impact per dollar
    of assets managed.
  29: Small-active investment advisors have the largest effect on the pricing of the
    environmental index, while foreign investors have the largest negative effect
  30: Small-active investment advisors and hedge funds are important for the pricing
    of governance in US markets.
  31: Small-active investment advisors see a 4% valuation ratio change (20bp p.a.)
    from a one standard deviation change in the environmental index. The transition
    from active to passive management impacts valuations and investor welfare. Institutional
    investors have become more passive over time.
  32: Latent demand and demand elasticities contribute equally to the reduction in
    the active share of investor portfolios. Portfolio tilts to characteristics increased
    the investors' active share.
  33: "Re-activating investors leads to relatively higher valuations for firms with\
    \ positive average latent demand and positive \u03B2\u20321xt (n)"
  34: Passive management trends increase the importance of environmental and governance
    characteristics in explaining valuation ratios. Reactivating investors (returning
    to 2007 activity levels) would benefit small-active investment advisors and hedge
    funds.
  35: Respondents to a survey consider regulatory risk the main risk over the next
    five years, followed by "stakeholder risk", and physical risks are considered
    to be most important over longer horizons (30 years).
  36: A broad shift in investor preferences toward green firms (stakeholder risk)
    has a larger impact on asset prices than regulatory changes affecting only long-term
    investors. Long-term investors, banks, and passive investors benefit most from
    the transition, while hedge funds and active investors are most exposed to climate-related
    transition risk.
  38: Foreign investors are particularly important for the valuation of green firms,
    while small-active investment advisors are important for the valuation of well-governed
    firms. The methodology can be used to develop "climate-risk stress tests" for
    a broader set of climate-related risks.
  45: The table presents the firm size distribution based on market capitalization,
    sales, and net income. It shows how these are distributed across different deciles
    of firm sizes.
  47: Environment score has a statistically significant positive association with
    both valuation and earnings growth in both time periods, though the effect size
    is smaller for the 2000-2019 period than the 2010-2019 period.
  49: The table shows total repricing by investor type, along with their share of
    assets under management (AUM) and a scaled repricing metric.

    governance scores, foreign sales, earnings, sales-to-book, and dividends-to-book.
  52: Changes in valuation regression coefficients when investors emphasize environmental
    scores, showing how ESG considerations can affect firm valuation.
  54: The analysis examines the relationship between market-to-book ratios and investment
    decisions for different institutional investor types (Inv. Large Passive, Inv.
    Small Passive, Inv. Small Active, Inv. Large Active, Hedge Funds, Long-Term, Private
    Banking, Brokers, Households).

  65: "Valuation ratios depend on \u03BDx(n), making direct estimation of equation\
    \ (16) problematic and necessitating instrumental variables."
Methodology:
  1: "Asset demand is estimated as a function of prices and characteristics. Portfolio\
    \ tilts across investors affects firm\u2019s valuation ratios."
  5: re-estimate the cross-sectional valuation regression using the counterfactual
    prices and do cument how the regression co efficients and residuals change
  7: "Develops a framework to quantify how characteristics are priced in the cross-section\
    \ of valuations and expected returns through portfolio choice. Uses counterfactuals\
    \ to capture regulatory and stakeholder risk, computing asset prices and investors\u2019\
    \ AUM. The analysis utilizes portfolio holdings data to learn about valuations\
    \ and expected returns."
  9: The paper presents a model of investor preferences that could be extended to
    add a 'taste' for characteristics, such as a firm's impact on the environment.
    The model uses equations to define budget constraints, risk aversion coefficients,
    and return on equity (ROE). It also involves assumptions about investor beliefs
    and information.
  12: Describes an experiment where an investor's assets are removed and redistributed
    to other investors to quantify their importance in price formation.
  13: The paper develops an empirically-tractable asset demand system based on Koijen
    and Yogo (2019) to analyze asset pricing and investor behavior, focusing on the
    top 90% of stocks by market capitalization. It calculates expected returns based
    on investor characteristics and demand.
  15: The study analyzes firm characteristics, stock prices, and portfolio holdings
    to understand investor behavior. Data are sourced from CRSP, Compustat, and FactSet
    (13-F reports). Investors are classified into eight groups based on type and investment
    style (active/passive, size). The household sector is constructed to reconcile
    total holdings with market capitalization.
  16: The methodology can be applied to other characteristics or different environmental
    and governance scores. The sample begins in 2000 and ends in 2019, with a subsample
    from 2010 to 2019 based on the availability of environmental and governance scores.
    The model is estimated on long positions only due to data limitations on short
    positions.
  19: Estimates the asset demand system using equations (10) and (11) to estimate
    the demand curve of investor *i*, expressed in equation (14), where characteristics
    are standardized cross-sectionally by quarter.
  20: The instrument is constructed by assuming that any stock an investor holds during
    the current year or the previous two years is part of the choice set. Counterfactual
    prices are computed when investors hold an equal-weighted portfolio of stocks
    in their investment universe.
  21: The analysis uses quarterly data.
  22: "Investors are grouped by type and size (at least 2000 positions per group per\
    \ year). A shrinkage target is determined using pooled quarters and quarter fixed\
    \ effects. Demand curves are estimated for each investor, fixing \u03B20,i,t to\
    \ avoid weak instruments. The shrinkage parameter is determined using cross-validation,\
    \ splitting holdings randomly in half by investor by year. The model is estimated\
    \ on one sample, and mean-squared error is computed on the left-out sample. The\
    \ shrinkage penalty declines if an investor has a larger number of holdings."
  23: "Estimates demand elasticity by institutional type. Uses an instrumental variable\
    \ approach, excluding hedge funds as a robustness check. Models the dependence\
    \ of characteristics x1,t(n) on valuation ratios, mbt (n), using equation (16).\
    \ Estimates investors\u2019 demand in two steps, first estimating h0,k, h1,k,\
    \ and h2,k, using zi,t(n) as an instrument."
  24: The analysis involves estimating residuals and using them as instruments in
    an asset demand system to assess firms' dividend policies in relation to stock
    prices.
  25: The paper uses a ridge estimator to estimate investor demand curves, accounting
    for heterogeneity across investors. It regresses demand coefficients (averaged
    across time for each manager) on institutional-type fixed effects.
  27: A demand system is used to estimate the impact of different investors on valuations.
    The methodology involves considering an outflow equal to the assets of a specific
    investor or group of investors, setting their assets to zero, and adding a flow
    to the assets of all other institutional investors. The model then solves for
    prices so that markets clear.
  28: "The analysis reallocates the assets of one group of investors to all others\
    \ and reports the repricing measure (\u03B8) and the ratio of the repricing measure\
    \ relative to the AUM share."
  29: Computes counterfactual equilibrium prices and valuation ratios and re-runs
    regressions.
  30: Uses the valuation model of Cohen, Polk, and Vuolteenaho (2003) and Campbell,
    Polk, and Vuolteenaho (2009) to map changes in valuations and their connection
    to characteristics to expected returns.
  31: Uses an estimated asset demand system to analyze the impact of the transition
    from active to passive management on valuations and welfare of investors.
  32: Uses a portfolio decomposition to analyze changes in investor strategies over
    time. The analysis focuses on the period from 2007 to 2019. Portfolio weights
    are computed using a formula involving factors such as elastic demand, preference
    for characteristics, and latent demand.
  33: Counterfactual analysis adjusting demand system coefficients to match active
    share components in 2007 and solving for asset prices and assets under management
  34: Regressions of market-to-book ratio (mbt) and change in market-to-book ratio
    (mbCFt) on firm characteristics in the last quarter of 2019. The analysis examines
    the impact of reactivating investors to 2007 levels.
  35: The authors use their framework to quantify climate-related risks by considering
    counterfactual scenarios that model regulatory risk (increase in environmental
    score coefficient for long-term investors) and stakeholder risk (changing preferences
    of consumers and employees).
  36: Regression analysis using actual log market-to-book ratios in 2019 and changes
    in log market-to-book ratios in counterfactual scenarios.
  37: Suggests modeling the expected impact of physical damages on firms' future cash
    flows and investor perception of risk, constructing counterfactuals to assess
    changes in risk perception.
  38: "An estimated asset demand system is used to analyze the impact of trends in\
    \ asset management, including the transition from active to passive management\
    \ and climate-related risks, on firm valuations and investors\u2019 welfare. It\
    \ can be adopted to other characteristics and applied to individual institutional\
    \ investors as well as groups of institutions."
  45: The analysis uses annual firm-level fundamentals data from CRSP and Compustat.
  47: Regressions of valuation ratios on firm-level characteristics with year fixed
    effects. Regressions performed for 2010-2019 and 2000-2019. Characteristics are
    standardized cross-sectionally by year. T-statistics clustered by year.
  49: Analysis uses quarterly data from FactSet, CRSP, and Compustat from 2000 to
    2019.
  51: Analysis performed using regression of log market-to-book ratios on standardized
    characteristics, scenario analysis with 2019 projections and 2007 activation.
  52: Regression analysis of log market-to-book ratios on firm characteristics and
    ESG scores. Counterfactual scenarios are used to simulate increased investor emphasis
    on environmental scores. Data is end of year for 2019.
  54: Investment universes are computed for varying backward and forward windows.
    The first number measures the trailing window in years and the second number the
    forward window in years. Baseline estimates are 3 years back and 0 years forward.
  55: The alternative estimates in the top panel are from a model that allows for
    endogenous dividend-to-book. In the bottom panel, the instrument for market equity
    is constructed omitting hedge funds. Firm-level fundamentals are from CRSP and
    Compustat. Holdings data are from FactSet. The sample runs from 2000 to 2019.
  56: The analysis uses histograms of time-series averages of institutions' demand
    curve estimates. Weighted averages are computed for each investor type, using
    AUM-share averages for each investor group and year, then averaging across years.
    The sample runs from 2000 to 2019. Governance and Environment data begins in 2010.
  57: Summary of demand curves by investor domicile; parameter estimates are averaged
    across years from 2000 to 2019; Governance and Environment data begins in 2010.
  60: The aggregate active share is calculated as the AUM (Assets Under Management)
    weighted active share across all institutional investors. Active share is calculated
    as one-half times the sum of the absolute value of active weights, where active
    weights are portfolio weights minus market weights within the set of stocks held
    for each manager. The decomposition measures the change attributable to changes
    in latent demand, characteristics demand, and demand elasticities.
  61: Quarterly observations are averaged to present a single yearly observation for
    2019. Firm-level fundamentals are from CRSP and Compustat. Holdings data are from
    FactSet.
  64: The paper uses 60-month rolling regressions of excess returns on the excess
    returns of the CRSP Value Weighted index, using 1-month treasury bill rates to
    calculate excess returns. They winsorize beta at the 2.5% and 97.5% level and
    Winsorize dividend-to-book, and sales-to-book at the 97.5% level by quarter. Values
    of Lerner less than -1 are set to -1. Fundamentals data from CRSP and Compustat
    are merged to FactSet by CUSIP. Data from Sustainalytics on CUSIP is merged by
    taking the most recent observation up to 12 months before.
  65: Develops a model to solve for valuation ratios (equation 30) and identifies
    an estimation challenge, suggesting the use of an instrumental variables estimator
    (ridge-IV estimator) which is implemented in Section V.D. Modifies standard GMM
    moment conditions to impose a shrinkage penalty and chooses the shrinkage target.
    Performs a first-stage regression (equation 31).
  66: "This section describes a method for estimating investor behavior using a shrinkage\
    \ estimator with a ridge penalty. It involves moment conditions, shrinkage targets,\
    \ and cross-validation to choose a shrinkage parameter (\u03BB)."
  67: The paper uses a first-order Taylor expansion to iteratively estimate parameters
    until convergence. It employs moment conditions and adjusts parameters with limits
    on the updating step for numerical stability. Initial estimates are obtained by
    omitting zero holdings and using linear moment conditions.

    would be larger (smaller).
  32: The paper analyzes the decline in the 'active share' of investors' portfolios,
    which is related to investment strategies and market behavior. This may have some
    connection to how investors react to climate-related risks, but the link is not

  33: The analysis focuses on the impact of active vs. passive investing on firm valuations,
    with a counterfactual scenario of reactivating investors to 2007 levels.
  34: "The paper suggests that the trend towards passive management could lead to\
    \ hedge funds underperforming relative to other investors. The final effect is\
    \ due to changes in investors\u2019 demand elasticity."

  27: The average change in valuations is computed using equation (21), which measures
    the total repricing if capital flows from one investor or group of investors.
  28: If the assets of small-active investment advisors get reallocated, the total

    \ a 9% change in a firm\u2019s valuation ratio as opposed to a 10% decline if\
    \ assets of small-active investment advisors or hedge funds are assigned to other\
    \ institutions."
  31: A one standard deviation change in the environmental index changes valuation
    ratios by 4%, which translates to 20bp per annum. Scaling factor around 20 in
    mapping changes in valuations to changes in expected returns.
  32: 'Decomposes the decline in the active share of investors'' portfolios from 2007
    to 2019 into three components: latent demand, portfolio tilts to characteristics,
    and elastic demand.'
  33: Scaling factors (c1, c2, c3) = (1.93, 0.88, 1.34)
  35: An increase of 0.1 in the environmental score coefficient for long-term investors
    implies a 10% increase in portfolio weight for a one standard deviation change
    in the environmental score (e.g., from 5% to 5.5%).
  36: 'Stakeholder risk counterfactual: coefficient increases by 0.57 from original
    value of 0.23. Regulatory risk counterfactual: coefficient increases by 0.03 from
    0.23.'
  37: No relevant information
  38: No quantitative material is directly presented on this page, but the asset demand
    system is described as being used to analyze impacts.
  45: 'The table shows the distribution of firms by market capitalization, sales,
    and net income for two time periods: 2019 Q4 and 2000 Q1. It displays the cumulative
    percentage of firms, sales, and net income represented by the top deciles of market
    capitalization. For example, in 2019 Q4, the top 10% of firms by market cap account
    for 3% of the total number of firms, 6% of sales, and 6% of net income.'
  47: Provides regression coefficients and t-statistics for the "Environment" variable,
    along with other firm-level characteristics, in predicting firm valuation and
    earnings growth. Also provides R-squared values.
  49: Repricing AUM scaled ranges from 0.90 to 3.58 across investor types.
  51: Regression coefficients for changes in log market-to-book ratios and characteristics
    in a scenario with re-activated institutional demand curves for 2019.
  52: Regression coefficients showing the impact of changes in ESG emphasis on log
    market-to-book ratios. For example, increasing the environment coefficient by
    0.1 results in a 0.57 change (All) and 0.03 change (LT).
  54: Presents estimates of coefficients on log market-to-book for various constructions
    of the investment universe. Each bar represents the time series average of the
    within-year AUM weighted coefficients for each institutional type.
  55: The figure displays the coefficient on log market-to-book for two alternative
    estimates versus the baseline estimates.
  56: Demand coefficients are multiplied by 100 except for LN mebe.
  57: Demand coefficients are multiplied by 100 except for LN mebe.
  60: The first bar measures the total change in the active share from 2007 to 2019.
    The chart shows the values 0.000, -0.025, -0.050, and -0.075 on the y-axis, potentially
    indicating the scale of changes in the active share.
  61: Figure presents the percent change in AUM for each institution type in a scenario
    where institutional demand curves in 2019 re-activated so that components of active
    share are the same as in 2007. Each bar is the AUM share weighted log change in
    AUM for institutions of that type. The figure contains data for Brokers, Hedge
    Funds, Long-Term, Inv. Large Passive, Inv. Small Passive, Inv. Small Active, Inv.
    Large Active, and Private Banking.
