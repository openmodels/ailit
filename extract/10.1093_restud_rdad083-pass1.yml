Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate-related risks, trend from active to passive management
  4: Outflows of assets from investor groups and reallocation of assets to other institutional
    investors.
  5: Redistribution of assets among different types of institutional investors, differences
    in investors' demand curves (heterogeneity), investor size, elasticity of demand
    curves of other investors, changes in the environmental index.
  6: Climate-related risks
  7: Regulatory risk and stakeholder risk (changing preferences of employees and customers).
  18: Environmental scores (as a measure of environmental performance), Governance
    scores (as an entrenchment index, implying weaker governance with higher values)
  34: Changes in investors' demand elasticity (becoming more elastic) impact capital
    allocation. The trend from active to passive investment management.
  36: Changes in investor preferences (stakeholder risk) and regulatory policies (regulatory
    risk) that favor green firms.
  37: Regulatory risk (carbon tax policy), stakeholder risk, physical damages from
    climate change, uncertainty surrounding physical damages.
  38: "Climate-related risks (due to changes in regulation or stakeholders\u2019 preferences),\
    \ transition from active to passive management."

Highlights:
  1: Increased demand for green firms would benefit long-term investors, banks, and
    passive investment advisors at the expense of hedge funds and small-active investment
    advisors.
  4: "The paper measures the importance of groups of investors on valuations by calculating\
    \ the impact of an outflow of all assets from one group of investors and its redistribution.\
    \ The paper computes the change in market clearing prices and investors\u2019\
    \ assets after the outflow."
  5: Foreign investors help to lower the cost of capital for green firms in the US.
    Hedge funds and small-active investment advisors have the largest impact on valuations
    per dollar of assets managed. Passive investment advisors and long-term investors
    have a relatively small impact on valuations.
  7: Long-term investors, banks, and passive investment advisors benefit from the
    transition, while active investment advisors and hedge funds experience a decline
    in AUM. The framework can be used to develop and implement 'climate stress tests'.
  18: Environmental scores have a positive correlation with firm valuation, while
    governance scores (measuring entrenchment) have a negative correlation.
  34: The shift from active to passive investment management makes environmental and
    governance characteristics more important in explaining valuation ratios. Reactivating
    investors would primarily benefit small-active investment advisors and hedge funds.
  36: A broad shift in investor preferences toward green firms has a large effect
    on firm valuations, while a shift limited to long-term investors (insurance companies
    and pension funds) has a much smaller effect. Transition risk may affect the highly-levered
    insurance sector, but regulating insurance companies may have only a small impact
    on asset prices.
  37: A comprehensive framework to conduct climate stress tests useful for bank and
    insurance supervisors exploring such questions.
  38: Foreign investors are particularly important for the valuation of green firms,
    while small-active investment advisors for the valuation of well-governed firms.
    Hedge funds, per dollar of assets that they manage, have the largest impact on
    prices.
  40: Examines how investors hedge against climate change news.
  45: The table shows how the percentage of sales and net income are concentrated
    among the top market cap deciles.
  49: The table shows how different investor types react to an implied risk (presumably
    climate risk) by reallocating their assets, impacting market capitalization. Hedge
    Funds show the highest Repricing AUM Scaled (3.58), suggesting a larger impact
    on market capitalization relative to their AUM share. Small Active investors also
    exhibit a relatively high Repricing AUM Scaled (2.28).
  51: Environmental and Governance scores impact firm valuation; coefficients reported
    in the table reflect these impacts.
  52: Increasing investor focus on environmental scores has a positive impact on company
    valuation (log market-to-book ratio), particularly when considering all investors.
    Governance scores and log book equity have negative coefficients in the original
    regression of log market-to-book ratio.
  53: No relevant information
  62: The figure shows how AUM changes for different investor types (Brokers, Hedge
    Funds, Long-Term, Inv. Small Passive, Inv. Small Active, Inv. Large Active, Inv.
    Large Passive, Private Banking) when environmental scores are given more weight
    in investment decisions. Results are shown for scenarios where all institutions
    vs. only long-term investors increase environmental consideration.
  64: The model shows how an investor's demand for a stock depends on its expected
    return, riskiness, and hedging benefits.
  68: The analysis decomposes the variance of market-to-book ratios into components
    attributable to expected returns and expected growth rates.
Methodology:
  1: The paper develops a new framework to quantitatively connect valuations, expected
    returns, and characteristics to the demands of institutional investors and households;
    estimates asset demand as a function of prices and characteristics using investor-level
    holdings data.
  4: "Calculates the impact of an outflow of all assets from one group of investors,\
    \ which is redistributed to all other institutional investors in proportion to\
    \ their assets under management. Recomputes the market clearing prices and investors\u2019\
    \ assets, which are impacted by returns and flows. Repricing measure is the absolute\
    \ changes in market values summed across all stocks. Firm-level fundamentals are\
    \ from CRSP and Compustat. Holdings data are from FactSet. The sample runs from\
    \ 2000 to 2019."
  5: The paper uses an experiment where they redistribute assets from one type of
    institutional investor to others and observe the impact on stock prices and the
    pricing of firm characteristics. They also re-estimate cross-sectional valuation
    regressions with counterfactual prices.
  6: Framework is used to quantify two key dimensions of climate-related risks but
    analysis of all risks is beyond the scope of the paper
  7: "The paper designs two counterfactuals to capture regulatory and stakeholder\
    \ risk for long-term investors, computes asset prices and investors\u2019 AUM,\
    \ and assesses changes in these counterfactuals. Valuation regressions are used\
    \ to quantify how characteristics are priced in the cross-section of valuations\
    \ and expected returns through the portfolio choice of institutional investors\
    \ and households."
  18: 'Panel regression of valuation ratios on firm characteristics (environmental
    scores, governance scores, log book equity, productivity, markup, stock''s market
    beta) with year fixed effects. Analysis performed using annual end-of-year data,
    studying two samples: 2000 to 2019 and 2010 to 2019.'
  34: Regression analysis of firm valuations (mbt(n) and mbCFt(n)) on firm characteristics
    in the last quarter of 2019. Analyzing changes in assets under management based
    on investor activity levels compared to 2007.
  36: Regression analysis is used to assess the impact of counterfactual scenarios
    (increased investor demand for green firms) on firm valuations (market-to-book
    ratios). The baseline year is 2019.
  37: Framework to assess how investors contribute to incorporating information into
    prices and long-horizon expected returns; asset demand system estimation; construction
    of counterfactuals where investors' perception of risk changes; climate stress
    tests.
  38: Estimated asset demand system is used. The methodology can be adopted to other
    characteristics, and can be applied to individual institutional investors as well
    as groups of institutions.
  40: Analysis of hedging behavior in response to climate change news.
  45: The analysis uses firm-level fundamentals (annual data) from CRSP and Compustat
    to analyze firm size distribution.
  49: The analysis examines the impact of asset reallocation by investor type on market
    capitalization. It calculates the percentage change in market cap if assets of
    an investor type are reallocated to other institutional investors in proportion
    to their assets. Uses holdings data from FactSet and firm-level fundamentals from
    CRSP and Compustat. The sample period is from 2000 to 2019, and values are time
    series averages of quarterly values.
  51: Regression analysis of log market-to-book ratios on firm characteristics, comparing
    a base case with a counterfactual scenario where institutional demand curves are
    re-activated to 2007 levels. Characteristics are standardized cross-sectionally
    by year. Data is end of year for 2019.
  52: Regression analysis of log market-to-book ratios on firm characteristics and
    ESG scores. Counterfactual scenarios are used where institutions care more about
    environmental scores. Data is for the year 2019.
  53: Equity holdings data from FactSet is used. Share of ownership is the annual
    average by institution type. Holdings data is quarterly from FactSet from 2000
    to 2019.
  62: The analysis calculates the AUM share weighted log change in AUM for institutions
    of each type after an increase of environmental awareness. Quarterly observations
    are averaged to present a single yearly observation for 2019.
  64: The paper uses rolling regressions to calculate betas, winsorizes data at certain
    levels, merges data from various sources, derives first-order conditions for investor
    behavior, aggregates investor demands, and solves for equilibrium asset prices.
  68: Variance decomposition is used to analyze the fraction of market-to-book ratios
    explained by characteristics.
More Notes:
  1: The characteristics include environmental and governance measures, as well as
    traditional risk and return characteristics.
  4: The study focuses on US data.
  5: The analysis contributes to the active ESG research agenda by identifying which
    investors matter for the pricing of ESG scores.
  18: The characteristics used in the regression explain 64% of the variation in the
    panel of valuation ratios after projecting out year fixed effects.
  34: The analysis implies that the trend towards passive management could negatively
    affect hedge funds and small-active investment advisors' performance relative
    to other investors, due to their high latent demand for stocks with positive latent
    demand among institutions.
  36: The main beneficiaries of the transition are long-term investors, banks, and
    passive investors, while those exposed to climate-related transition risk are
    hedge funds and active investors.
  37: The framework can be extended to model the impact of a carbon tax on firm valuations
    and investors and to model the expected impact of physical damages and the uncertainty
    surrounding it.
  38: The paper discusses how the application of the asset demand system can be used
    to develop 'climate-risk stress tests' for a broader set of climate-related risks.
  40: The Engle et al. (2020) paper directly addresses climate change, focusing on
    investor reactions to climate news and hedging strategies within financial markets.
    This may be relevant for understanding how financial actors perceive and react
    to climate-related risks, potentially affecting investment decisions and capital
    allocation at a national level. It does not provide macroeconomic/fiscal outcomes
    or adaptation cost/benefit measures.
  45: The table provides a snapshot of firm size distribution and the concentration
    of sales and net income at two specific points in time (2019 Q4 and 2000 Q1).
    The relevance to macroeconomic and macro-fiscal risks of climate change and adaptation
    is not immediately apparent from this single page.
  49: The study implicitly links investor behavior and asset repricing to potential
    risks, though the specific risks are not explicitly mentioned as "climate risks"
    in the text. It uses a relative measure of repricing scaled by AUM share, allowing
    for comparison across investor types of different sizes.
  51: The study uses Sustainalytics environmental scores and an entrenchment index
    for governance. It examines the relationship between firm characteristics and
    market-to-book ratios.
  53: This paper studies the ownership of equities by different types of institutions,
    which is not directly related to climate change or adaptation costs and benefits.
  62: The data used are from CRSP, Compustat, and FactSet.
  64: The paper appears to build a model of asset pricing based on investor behavior
    and firm fundamentals, potentially incorporating environmental, social, and governance
    (ESG) factors via Sustainalytics data though this is not explicit from this page.
    The model could be extended to assess macroeconomic risks of climate change.
  68: The analysis appears to be focused on financial markets and the impact of firm
    characteristics, expected returns, and growth rates on market-to-book ratios.
    The relevance to macroeconomic risks of climate change and the costs/benefits
    of adaptation is unclear without further context.

  34: Firm valuations are affected, influencing investors' assets and potentially
    leading to lower returns for investors with positive latent demand for stocks
    with negative size-weighted average latent demand.
  36: Firm valuations (measured by market-to-book ratios) are affected by shifts in
    investor demand for green firms, representing a transition risk impact.

Quantitative material:
  1: "The paper quantifies how portfolio tilts across investors affects firm\u2019\
    s valuation ratios."
  4: Reports the fraction of assets under management and repricing; Repricing is the
    percent change in market cap if the assets of an investor are reallocated as flows
    to all other institutional investors in proportion to their assets; Change in
    market cap normalized by the fraction of ownership
  5: A one standard deviation increase in the environmental index leads to a 17% increase
    in valuations; reallocation of assets from foreign investors would drop this to
    14%, while reallocation from small-active investment advisors would increase it
    to 21%.
  6: No specific quantitative information on climate related risks is provided on
    this page, only that the framework can be used to quantify two key dimensions
    of climate risks.
  7: Long-term investors, banks, and passive investment advisors benefit from the
    transition, while active investment advisors and hedge funds experience a decline
    in AUM.
  18: "A one standard deviation increase in the environmental score is associated\
    \ with a 17% increase in a firm\u2019s market-to-book ratio. A one standard deviation\
    \ increase in the governance score is associated with a 10% lower valuation ratio."
  34: A one-standard deviation change in the environmental index increases valuation
    ratios by 23% in 2019, reducing to 14% if investors are as active as in 2007.
    A one-standard deviation increase in the entrenchment index leads to a valuation
    ratio response decreasing from -14% to -5% if investors are as active as in 2007.
    Reactivating investors leads to a 6.9% increase in assets under management for
    small-active investment advisors and a 14.1% increase for hedge funds, with a
    decline for other institutional investors.
  36: In the stakeholder risk counterfactual, the coefficient for the environmental
    score increases by 0.57 from its original value of 0.23. In the regulatory risk
    counterfactual, the coefficient increases by 0.03 from 0.23.
