Drivers of Risk:
  2: Failure of embankments during moderate to extreme floods; disruption in hydraulic
    connection between river and floodplain; prioritizing technical and economic viability
    of flood protection without considering hydromorphological features and socio-economic
    conditions.
  3: River flooding and drainage congestion during the monsoon, impacted by upstream
    interventions.
  10: Introduction of embankment (historical), spatial access to services and infrastructure
    (electricity/energy, proximity to services).
  12: Hydro-climatic events (specifically floods) are the primary drivers of risk.
  13: Flooding (inundated area) and tide levels are identified as potential drivers
    of risk.
Highlights:
  2: Flood protection measures have both positive (e.g., increased agricultural output)
    and negative (e.g., damage to fisheries) consequences; a shift from flood control
    to integrated flood management has occurred, but translating this into action
    remains a challenge; restoration and modification of existing embankments are
    emphasized in the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100.
  3: "The Meghna\u2013Dhonagoda Irrigation Project (MDIP) is one of the largest flood\
    \ control, drainage and irrigation projects in Bangladesh, implemented in 1988\
    \ with the objective to protect the area in Matlab North from river flooding and\
    \ drainage congestion during the monsoon via embankment and regulators, with the\
    \ primary aim was to improve agricultural conditions in monsoon, with special\
    \ reference to encouraging introduction to high yielding variety (HYV) monsoon\
    \ rice (Aman), and also to provide irrigation from surface water in the Rabi (dry)\
    \ season and early monsoon seasons."
  10: A significant relationship existed between embankment introduction and changes
    in land ownership patterns. More recent development progress is linked to electricity/energy
    access and proximity to services rather than just land changes.
  12: Embankments seem to have a statistically significant impact on internal movement
    rates (p < 0.01), as evidenced by the chi-squared test results in Table 2. The
    figures show a reduction in death rates, stabilization of internal movements,
    and a changing relationship between inside and outside in-migration rates following
    the embankment construction (around 1990).
  13: No relevant information
  14: Approaches may be relevant to address global flood risk challenges and evaluate
    both intended and unintended consequences of human interventions.
Methodology:
  3: "Machine learning approaches are used to evaluate the impacts of flood management\
    \ interventions in Bangladesh. It uses existing data set of Meghna\u2013Dhonagoda\
    \ Irrigation Project (MDIP) to provide robust metrics to evaluate the impacts\
    \ of interventions as well as identifying the most informative indicators."
  10: Socio-economic survey data aggregated over 'bari' (likely a geographical unit).  Wilcoxon
    statistic used to compare AUCs across years. Stacked Auto-Encoders used for dimensionality
    reduction and cluster identification. Gaussian Processes used to model event data
    over time. Spatial analysis to assess relationships between variables and geographic
    location.
  11: inundated areas in Matlab in two major flood years, delineated from LANDSAT4-5TM
    images using Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)
  12: "Generalized Pareto (GP)-based modeling is used to study the relationship between\
    \ hydro-climatic events and socio-economic behavior. Chi-squared tests are used\
    \ to compare event rates before and after embankment construction. Analysis of\
    \ temporal difference for three specific events: inward/outward movement, inside/outside\
    \ in-migration, and inside/outside mortality during 1983\u20132014."
  13: The analysis uses land elevation data and LANDSAT imagery with Normalized Difference
    Water Index (NDWI) to delineate inundated areas. Applicable to Matlab North, Matlab
    South and Daudkandi Upazilas.
  14: Quantitative analysis of embankment impacts using machine-learning approaches,
    integrating socio-economic and ancillary data to evaluate short-term and long-term
    consequences of interventions.
More Notes:
  3: The project area is 184.4 km2 with a population of 230,185 as of 30 June 2014.
    The analysis is done in Matlab North.
  10: The study area appears to be in Bangladesh based on the mention of icddr,b hospital.
    The primary goal of using Stacked Auto-Encoders was to learn useful lower-dimensional
    representation of data.
  11: No relevant information
  12: The study focuses on a specific geographic area with embankment construction
    as an adaptation measure. The results are limited to the context of this specific
    intervention and location.
  13: The study acknowledges limitations due to data availability, small study size,
    and lack of enough common indicators across different years. It also mentions
    the impact of other infrastructures (health, roads, electricity, education, etc.)
    in relation to the embankment.

  6: This page focuses on machine learning classification and regression techniques
    for analyzing socio-economic survey data, with no direct mention of macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal risks of climate change, costs/benefits of adaptation, or related
    economic outcomes at a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Increased agricultural output in flood-protected areas; damage from moderate
    to extreme floods is higher in protected areas due to accelerated economic activity;
    damage to fisheries and local boat transports; compromised livelihoods, especially
    for marginalized people.
  3: No relevant information
  10: Land ownership patterns, access to drinking water sources, primary fuel source,
    household proximity to services (e.g., hospitals, gaslines).
  11: No relevant information
  12: Mortality, internal movement, and in-migration are examined as socio-economic
    outcomes impacted by hydro-climatic events.

Quantitative material:
  3: No relevant information
  10: AUC values for discriminating between socio-economic conditions across four
    years (1982, 1996, 2005, 2014), standard errors, Z-scores, and p-values for comparing
    AUCs.
  12: "Table 2 provides \u03C7\xB2 values and p-values for comparing event rates (internal\
    \ movement, in-migration, and mortality) pre- and post-embankment. Figures also\
    \ give visualized values of death rates and in-migration and internal movement\
    \ per 1000 mid-year population."
  13: The graphs show monthly inward/outward movement of households and monthly high
    tide levels from 1984-2016. The maps show flooded areas for September 1988 and
    September 1998.
