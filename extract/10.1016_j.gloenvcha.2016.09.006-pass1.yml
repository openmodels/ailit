Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate variability including temperature anomalies and rainfall patterns
  2: Climate change impacts on rainfall and temperature, particularly affecting rain-fed
    agriculture; Warming temperatures and heat waves.
  7: Warming temperatures, frequency of heat waves, and changes in precipitation patterns
    impacting agriculture in Ethiopia.
  9: Fluctuations in both temperature and precipitation; climate change (deviations
    from long-term historical conditions); rainfall shocks
  11: No relevant information
  17: Early life climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation) during spring,
    summer, and winter.
  38: Number of hot winters, Number of cold winters, Number of wet winters, Number
    of dry winters
  39: Summer temperature, summer precipitation, winter temperature, winter precipitation,
    spring temperature, spring precipitation impact per capita food consumption, household
    food insecurity, and crop yields (Teff, Barley, Maize, Wheat).
Highlights:
  1: Climatic conditions like milder temperatures and increased rainfall are linked
    to better educational outcomes in rural Ethiopia
  2: Populations in sub-Saharan Africa are particularly vulnerable to climate variability
    due to high reliance on rain-fed agriculture.
  7: Significant reductions in agricultural production expected under conservative
    emissions scenarios.
  11: The study villages were selected to represent Ethiopia's varied agro-ecological
    zones, including the country's main farming systems as of 1994, but cannot be
    considered nationally representative as it does not include pastoralists or urban
    residents.
  17: Early life climatic conditions are important determinants of schooling.
  38: Number of hot winters has a statistically significant (p < 0.001) positive coefficient
    in one model (1.32 ***).
  39: Summer temperature has a significant negative impact on per capita food consumption
    and Teff yields, and a significant positive impact on household food insecurity.
Methodology:
  1: Use of longitudinal socioeconomic, demographic, and schooling data linked to
    high-resolution gridded climate data; multivariate regression models
  2: The analysis connects climate change impacts on agriculture to household investments
    in human capital.
  9: "Examines both rainfall and temperature over the first seven years of a child\u2019\
    s life; measure climate as deviations from long-term historical conditions; examine\
    \ the interactions between climatic conditions and the child\u2019s sex"
  11: This paper uses household survey data from the Ethiopian Rural Household Survey
    (ERHS), a large panel dataset collected from rural villages in Ethiopia conducted
    with approximately 1,500 households in 15 Ethiopian villages in 1994, 1995, 1997,
    1999, 2004, and 2009.
  17: Logistic regression of the likelihood of completing at least one grade of school,
    using climate z-scores (relative to 1970-2009) as predictors. Child labor data
    included participation in farm and domestic labor as well as hours per week spent
    on those activities. The data were collected in the 2004 and 2009 surveys
  38: The analysis uses regression models that include control variables (not shown).
    A Wald test is used to jointly test the significance of schooling coefficients
    for climate variables.
  39: The analysis uses regression models to predict per capita food consumption,
    rainy season food security, and crop yields based on recent climate variables.
    Household controls, community fixed-effects, and survey year fixed-effects are
    included in the models.
More Notes:
  1: No relevant information
  2: The paper suggests a 'resource degradation poverty trap' where climate change
    impacts limit investment in income-generating activities and human capital.
  9: The study focuses on Ethiopia.
  11: The study villages range in elevation from 1200 to 2900 m, mean annual rainfall
    ranges from 470 to 1300 mm, and rainfall is highly seasonal. The majority of study
    households rely on smallholder agriculture as their primary source of income.
  17: Climate variables were defined as z-scores for climate during specific seasons
    relative to all other periods from the same season from 1970-2009.
  25: This page focuses on micro-level impacts and adaptation strategies related to
    education and household welfare, not macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at
    a national level.
  38: The table presents coefficients and significance levels related to climate variables
    and schooling. The dependent variable and precise economic meaning of the reported
    coefficients are not stated on this page.
  39: The analysis is based on household-level data and crop yields in specific regions.
    The food security data was only collected in the 2004 and 2009 survey rounds.

  17: A child who experienced average spring temperatures 0.5 standard deviations
    (SD) above the village's long-term mean has a 21% lower odds of completing at
    least one grade of school (p=0.049). Experiencing summer temperatures 0.5 SD above
    the village long-term average is associated with a 28% lower odds of completing
    any schooling (p=0.001), and experiencing summer precipitation 0.5 SD above the
    mean is associated with a 22% higher odds (p=0.050). Experiencing average early
    childhood winter temperatures 0.5 SD above the village long-term mean is associated
    with an 43% higher odds of any schooling (p=0.016).
