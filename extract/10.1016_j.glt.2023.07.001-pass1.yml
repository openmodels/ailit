Drivers of Risk:
  1: Fossil fuel-driven climate change and air pollution.
  2: Air pollution and climate change, specifically driven by fossil fuel combustion,
    are identified as key drivers impacting children's health.
  3: Air pollution, fossil fuel combustion, and climate change contribute to health
    risks.
  4: The paper highlights climate change factors such as extreme temperatures, air
    pollution, and severe weather events as drivers impacting respiratory health and
    contributing to physical trauma and mental illnesses.
  5: The drivers of risk include exposure to high temperatures, air pollutants, climate-related
    undernutrition, and infections.
Evaluation overview:
  1: The impact of fossil fuel combustion on children's health and the associated
    losses of human capital.
  2: The paper focuses on the health impacts of fossil fuel combustion on children
    from fetal development through adolescence, considering outcomes like morbidity,
    mortality, labor capacity, and overall human capital development.
  3: Child health impacts and human capital losses due to environmental exposures
    outlined.
  4: This paper discusses the impacts of climate change and air pollution on human
    capital, particularly focusing on health, cognitive ability, and non-cognitive
    abilities.
  5: This paper evaluates the impacts of climate change and air pollution on cognitive
    and non-cognitive abilities, and the associated economic losses due to impaired
    labor productivity.
Highlights:
  1: Fossil fuel combustion can significantly impact the lifelong health and human
    capital for generations; climate change and air pollution not only deteriorate
    children's health but also affect the entire human capital in their adulthood;
    call for a more holistic assessment of the full range of impacts borne by children,
    including direct damages to children's health, losses of human capital, and associated
    economic costs.
  2: Children are uniquely vulnerable to air pollution and climate change due to immature
    physiology, metabolism, and unique behaviors and exposures, leading to adverse
    birth outcomes, effects on the neural system, malnutrition, respiratory effects,
    physical trauma, and mental illness.
  3: Environmental exposures result in adverse birth outcomes, neurodevelopmental
    effects, malnutrition, infectious diseases, respiratory diseases, mental illness,
    and physical trauma in children.
  4: Exposure to air pollution and climate change-related factors can adversely affect
    health and mental health, potentially influencing human capital development over
    the lifespan.
  5: Climate change and air pollution can impact life-time cognition and non-cognitive
    skills through health damages; these impacts can lead to lowered income and self-esteem
    in adulthood.
Methodology:
  2: The paper summarizes scientific evidence of the major health effects on developing
    fetuses and children to reflect the impacts of fossil fuel combustion through
    a life-course perspective.
  5: The paper reviews existing literature on the associations between early-life
    exposure to environmental stressors and cognitive/non-cognitive outcomes.
More Notes:
  2: The paper emphasizes the need for a more holistic assessment of the impacts of
    fossil fuel burning on current and future human health and potential, advocating
    for policies to facilitate clean energy transition.
  3: The flowchart provides a visual representation of the pathways from environmental
    exposures to child health effects and human capital losses.
Quantitative material:
  1: Air pollution leads to approximately 4.2 million premature deaths each year,
    and climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths every year from 2030
    to 2050.
  2: Cord plasma insulin levels significantly increased by 15.8% for each SD increment
    in PM2.5 levels during the entire pregnancy, with the most pronounced effect in
    the 2nd trimester.
  5: Average IQ scores of PTB-born children were 11e12 points lower than peers born
    typically. LBW children had similar reductions (10 points) in IQ scores.
