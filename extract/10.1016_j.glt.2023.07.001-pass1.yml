Drivers of Risk:
  1: Fossil fuel-driven air pollution and climate change impacting children's health.
Highlights:
  1: Fossil fuel combustion can significantly impact the lifelong health and human
    capital for generations. Early-life health damages from climate change and air
    pollution affect human capital in adulthood.
More Notes:
  1: The paper calls for a more holistic assessment of the full range of impacts borne
    by children, including direct damages to children's health, losses of human capital,
    and associated economic costs.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Losses of human capital due to the impact of fossil fuel combustion on children's
    health.
Quantitative material:
  1: Air pollution leads to approximately 4.2 million premature deaths each year.
    Climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths every year from 2030 to
    2050.
