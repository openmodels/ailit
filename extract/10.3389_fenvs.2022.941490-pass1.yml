Drivers of Risk:
  9: GHG emissions from various sectors, shorter-lived trace gases, climate feedbacks
    (clouds, aerosols, biosphere), vulnerability, exposure.
  16: No relevant information
  17: Sudden-onset events (cyclones, flooding, heat waves, fires); Slow-onset events
    (sea-level rise, glacier melting, drought); Climate-induced changes in snow cover;
    Thawing permafrost soils.
Highlights:
  16: It is arguably impossible to measure progress, adequacy, and effectiveness of
    enhancing resilience and reducing vulnerability of societies and individuals as
    foreseen in the Paris Agreement since these aspects are by definition counter-factual.
  17: EO has the potential to offer evidence-based information for risk mapping, building
    early warning systems, and conducting impact assessments related to loss and damage
    from climate change.
Methodology:
  9: Combining modeling and EO in data assimilation systems, using essential climate
    variables and derived climate data records, attribution of observed changes.
  16: Modelling systems with and without adaptation measures could be developed to
    quantify differences between the real world and the world that would have been
    without a given adaptation measure, offering the opportunity to explore inherent
    uncertainties.
  17: Using EO (Earth Observation) for risk mapping, building early warning systems,
    and conducting impact assessments; Combining EO imagery (e.g., Sentinel-1) with
    socio-economic information to derive each event's extent and impact.
More Notes:
  9: The figure depicts pathways from emissions to climate impacts and adaptation
    needs, highlighting the role of Earth observation (EO) in providing information
    and constraints on the Earth system.
  10: This page primarily focuses on satellite detection of methane emissions as a
    tool for identifying mitigation opportunities, rather than quantifying macroeconomic
    or fiscal risks and adaptation costs/benefits. It is more relevant to identifying
    sources of climate change risk than directly assessing its economic impacts.
  16: This page focuses on the role of Earth Observation (EO) data in informing adaptation
    efforts and developing adaptation indicators. It emphasizes the challenges in
    measuring the effectiveness of adaptation due to the counter-factual nature of
    the problem (i.e., comparing what happened with adaptation to what would have
    happened without it).
  17: The paper suggests leveraging progress made in the use of EO for disaster risk
    reduction within the sustainable development framework. The insurance and reinsurance
    sector is identified as a key user of such information for parametric insurance
    products to spread economic risk and increase financial stability.

  3: This page primarily discusses Earth Observation (EO) data, climate services,
    and international collaborations related to climate change. It does not directly
    address specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, economic costs/benefits of
    adaptation, or provide quantitative assessments of these aspects at a national
    level.
