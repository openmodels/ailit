Drivers of Risk:
  1: Simultaneous soybean failures in the Americas driven mostly by changes in mean
    climate; climate variability increases country-level failures.
  2: Climate change affects long-term trends of mean climate and climate variability
    impacting agricultural sectors.
  4: Projected changing climatic conditions and anomalous weather conditions impacting
    soybean yield.
  6: Future climatic forcing conditions, specifically increasing CO2 concentrations
    impacting climate sensitivity, and extreme weather events (analogous to the 2012
    event).
  7: Climatic conditions, specifically hotter and drier conditions compared to historical
    climatology and the 2012 event, although variability in climatic conditions is
    noted.
  8: Climate change impacts, specifically changes in precipitation and temperature
    during critical growing months (January, February, March), leading to regional
    and aggregated soybean failures
  9: Climatic conditions such as higher temperatures and lower precipitation during
    soybean production seasons contribute to risks.
  11: Weather extremes (precipitation and temperature anomalies) and deforestation
    associated with soybean expansion are drivers of risk.
  12: Increase of risk of simultaneous extreme soybean losses driven by the long-term
    mean effects of climate change and changes in climate variability regionally.
Highlights:
  1: Long-term mean climate changes increase frequency of 2012-like simultaneous soybean
    failures by 11-16 times; adaptation to mean climate changes may reduce future
    risks.
  2: The study focuses on climate change-induced risks of extreme simultaneous soybean
    failures in the Americas and disentangles changes in mean climate change from
    changes in climate variability.
  6: Adaptation significantly reduces the number and magnitude of future soybean yield
    losses due to climate change, making analog events of the 2012 event far less
    likely.
  7: Expected damages associated with 2012 analogs are shown to increase in the US,
    Brazil, and Argentina when compared to the 2012 event.
  8: Country-level analogs are more frequent than aggregated analogs in the future,
    and the average losses of country-level analogs increase with respect to the historical
    2012 event for all three countries individually. The US shows the highest number
    of country-level analogs.
  9: Adaptation to changes in mean climate significantly reduces the risk of soybean
    production failures in comparison to climate variability changes.
  11: The paper analyzes the impact of climate variability on soybean yields, considering
    both adaptation and no-adaptation scenarios, and acknowledges the importance of
    deforestation and irrigation in the context of soybean production.
  12: Successful adaptation to mean climate change can minimize the risk of extreme
    soybean losses.
Methodology:
  1: Use of a hybrid crop model, combining a process-based crop model with machine
    learning to simulate soybean production and assess future scenarios.
  2: The study develops a hybrid model to analyze how climate change affects soybean
    yields by linking weather conditions to crop yields and using impact analogs to
    identify future events with significant impacts.
  4: The study uses a hybrid model combining simulated soybean yields and climate
    indices in a multilayer perceptron to assess impacts on soybean production, complemented
    by the use of impact analogs for future risk predictions.
  6: The study investigates the total number of analog events of the 2012 soybean
    yield event under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and adaptation
    scenarios using a hybrid model.
  7: Spatial analysis of nine impact analogs in an adaptation scenario to determine
    production losses in each country. The 2012 event is compared with analog years.
    'Country-level analogs' are also explored.
  8: The study uses an analog approach, comparing simulated climatic conditions (precipitation
    and temperature) for a historical event (2012 soybean failure) with past climatic
    conditions to identify 'analogs'. It also examines the co-occurrence of country-level
    and aggregated analogs.
  9: Uses climate model simulations and a hybrid model approach to analyze the impacts
    of climatic conditions on soybean yields.
  11: The study uses climate models (GCMs) under different climate sensitivities and
    SSP scenarios to simulate future soybean yields. The analysis focuses on rainfed
    harvest areas based on 2010 data, and it removes long-term trends in the adaptation
    scenario, thus not considering CO2 fertilization effects in that scenario.
  12: The analysis involves using historic events, such as the 2012 aggregated crop
    yield failure, for assessing climate impacts and adaptation responses.
More Notes:
  6: The study emphasizes the importance of considering climate sensitivity to CO2
    concentrations when projecting future impacts and the dominance of trends in mean
    climate on the risk of 2012 analogs to occur.
  7: The analysis highlights the different ways that extreme impacts result from anomalous
    weather conditions, and that simultaneous soybean failures are impactful events
    for globalized markets.
  9: The analysis focuses on the effects of climate change on soybean production in
    the US, Brazil, and Argentina, examining analogs of the 2012 production failure
    event.
  11: The study acknowledges limitations, such as not considering the expansion of
    harvesting area or irrigation. The potential for extending the analysis to land
    use change, poverty vulnerability, and global hunger is mentioned. Sampling uncertainty
    is addressed through the use of large ensembles. Model or scenario uncertainty
    can be explored by adopting a larger set of GCMs and SSPs.
  12: Potential adaptation options vary greatly between changes in mean climate and
    changes in climate variability.

Quantitative material:
  6: Without adaptation, a high occurrence of 2012 analogs is estimated under SSP5-8.5
    (82 annual yield values at or below the 2012 yield), with mean climatological
    values crossing the 2012 threshold around 2060. Fewer analogs are observed under
    SSP1-2.6 (43). Mean production losses are 17% larger than the original 2012 event
    for SSP5-8.5 and 6% for SSP1-2.6 without adaptation. With adaptation, only 9 analogs
    occur in the future (4 for SSP1-2.6 and 5 for SSP5-8.5). Losses are 2.3% and 2.2%
    larger than the 2012 event for SSP5-8.5 and SSP1-2.6, respectively, with adaptation.
    2012 analogs are approximately 11 and 16 times more likely in the no adaptation
    scenario than in the adaptation scenario for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively.
    The average magnitude of the analogs is also 4% and 15% higher in the no adaptation
    scenario than in the adaptation for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. The 2012
    event had an accumulated loss of 21.1 Mt, with 7.2 Mt in the US, 4.9 Mt in Brazil,
    and 9 Mt in Argentina.
  7: Compared to the 2012 event, analog losses increase by -1.5 Mt (-4.1 Mt, 1.0 Mt)
    in the US, -0.5 Mt (-5.9 Mt, 4.8 Mt) in Brazil, and -0.6 Mt (-4.0 Mt, 2.8 Mt)
    in Argentina.
  8: "Average losses associated with country-level analogs increase by \u22122.7 Mt\
    \ (\u22123.1 Mt, \u22122.2 Mt) in the US, \u22122.5 Mt (\u22123.7 Mt, \u22121.4\
    \ Mt) in Brazil, and \u22122.4 Mt (\u22123.2 Mt, \u22121.6 Mt) in Argentina with\
    \ respect to the corresponding country-level losses observed in 2012."
  9: The adaptation scenario shows that risks similar to the 2012 event are 11 to
    16 times less frequent and 4% to 15% less intense for different scenarios.
