Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in mean climate and climate variability (hot and dry conditions).
  2: Adverse weather conditions, climate extremes, multivariate or temporally compounding
    events, long-term trends of mean climate, climate variability.
  3: Climate data (daily maximum and minimum temperature, and total daily precipitation)
    from GCMs drive the analysis. Specific climate indices are calculated using the
    R package Climpact.
  4: Climatic conditions, specifically temperature and precipitation, during a 3-month
    season based on the soybean reproductive stage.
  6: Future climatic forcing conditions, differences in climate sensitivity to increasing
    CO2 concentrations, and extreme weather events such as the 2012 drought.
  7: Dryer and hotter climatic conditions during the analog events, particularly in
    the first and second months of the season, contribute to the outcomes.
  8: Precipitation and average daily maximum temperature anomalies
  9: The risks are driven by changes in mean climate and climate variability, including
    compounding hot and dry conditions during the soybean reproductive season.
  11: Factors impacting outcomes include changes in sowing dates, regions planted,
    and genetic modification of soybean cultivars.
  12: Long-term mean effects of climate change are the primary driver. Changes in
    climate variability are expected to increase regionally in all three countries.
  13: Extreme weather events (droughts, heatwaves, hot-dry compound extremes), climate
    change, and changes in yield variability are identified as impacting crop yields.

  4: "Soybean yield losses, defined as the difference between annual soybean production\
    \ and the mean production for the 2000\u20132015 period."
  6: Projected soybean yields under different climate scenarios with and without adaptation.
  7: The page provides an overview of soybean yield anomalies and production losses
    in the U.S., Brazil, and Argentina under the adaptation scenario compared to the
    2012 event.
  8: Soybean yield loss
  9: The analysis evaluates extreme soybean failures in the US, Brazil, and Argentina
    with respect to climatic conditions analogous to the 2012 event.
  12: Extreme soybean losses in the Americas.
  13: This page includes a list of citations related to the impact of climate change
    on agriculture, particularly crop yields (wheat, soy, maize) and productivity.
Highlights:
  1: Long-term trends in mean climate increase the frequency of simultaneous soybean
    failures. Adaptation to long-term mean climate trends may reduce the future risk
    of simultaneous soybean losses.
  2: Analyzes potential changes in analog frequency and magnitude and the driving
    climatic conditions. Determines whether the risk of extreme soybean failures across
    the Americas is changing due to climate change, disentangling changes in mean
    climate change from changes in climate variability.
  4: The study investigates the risk of future soybean failures by identifying years
    with yield losses exceeding those observed in 2012, and analyzes associated climatic
    conditions and spatial distributions.
  6: Without adaptation, the occurrence of 2012-like drought impacts on soybean yields
    is heavily dependent on future climatic forcing conditions, with more analogs
    occurring under SSP5-8.5 than SSP1-2.6. Adaptation significantly reduces the number
    and magnitude of these analogs. Trends in mean climate dominate the risk of 2012
    analogs.
  7: Increased damages are observed across the U.S., Brazil, and Argentina during
    the analyzed analog years compared to 2012; there is significant variability in
    climatic conditions leading to extreme impacts.
  8: Country-level analogs are more frequent than aggregated analogs in the future,
    and the average losses of country-level analogs increase with respect to the historical
    2012 event for all three countries individually. The US shows the highest number
    of country-level analogs, significantly higher than the other two countries. The
    original 2012 event was the result of the three countries having low yields, and
    2012 analogs occur due to one or two countries presenting country-level analogs
    in the same year, but no single country dominates the frequency of 2012 analogs.
  9: Successful adaptation to changes in mean climate can minimize the majority of
    climate change-caused impacts on simultaneous soybean failures across the Americas.
  11: The removal of long-term trends in the adaptation scenario excludes the effects
    of CO2 fertilization for the 'no adaptation' scenario.
  12: Adaptation measures to mean climate change can minimize the increase of risk
    of simultaneous extreme soybean losses in the Americas. The difference in impacts
    to changes in mean climate and changes in climate variability is large.
  13: 'The citations point to research on the impacts of climate change on crop yields,
    including: impacts on wheat yield in south-eastern Australia, protecting the soy
    economy from warming, simultaneous soybean failures, global crop models underestimating
    yield responses to droughts and heatwaves, weather-induced crop failure events,
    and optimal soybean sowing dates.'
Methodology:
  1: A hybrid crop model, coupling a process-based crop model with a machine learning
    model, is used to improve the simulation of soybean production. Future scenarios
    with different levels of global warming are used to analyze soybean losses with
    respect to present day and future conditions.
  2: 'Develops a hybrid model to link weather conditions to crops yields and adopts
    the concept of impact analogs to identify events in the future with similar or
    larger impacts than the 2012 event. Analyzes two baseline scenarios: one with
    a static current climate baseline and one accounting for the trends in mean climate
    and crop yield.'
  3: A hybrid model is built using simulated climate data, simulated yields (from
    GGCM EPIC-IIASA), and observed yields (from USDA, IBGE, and MAGYP). The analysis
    uses climate data from 1901-2015 (historical) and projections from 2016-2100.
    Observed yield data from 1979-2015 is used to train and validate the hybrid model.
    Harvest areas are fixed to 2012 values for projections.
  4: A hybrid model combining simulated soybean yields from EPIC-IIASA and climate
    indices is calibrated to observed yields using a multilayer perceptron (MLP).
    Impact analogs are used to assess the future risk of soybean failures, defining
    analogs as years with larger negative yield anomalies than observed in 2012. The
    climatology is based on the 2000-2015 period.
  6: Uses a hybrid model to simulate soybean yields at the grid cell scale, comparing
    no adaptation and adaptation scenarios under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5. Analyzes the
    number of analog events of the 2012 drought event in future projections.
  7: Impact analogs are used to evaluate soybean yield anomalies in adaptation scenarios,
    considering climatic conditions and variations in analyzed years.
  8: Comparison of climatic conditions (precipitation, temperature) of 2012 analogs
    to the simulated 2012 event; Identification of country-level analogs to assess
    co-occurrences of regional and aggregated soybean failures.
  9: The study uses climate model simulations driven by future emission scenarios
    and applies a hybrid model to simulate climate conditions' effects on yields,
    focusing on years with extreme weather conditions.
  11: The study used soybean harvest areas documented for 2012 and focused on rainfed
    areas based on data from 2010.
  12: Uses simulations to assess the risk of simultaneous extreme soybean losses in
    the Americas. Analysis techniques may need to be specific to mean climate and
    climate variability impacts. Historic events like the 2012 aggregated crop yield
    failure are used as a framework.
  13: The citations reference various methodologies including machine learning, biophysical
    models, crop modeling, global gridded crop models, statistical models, and storyline
    approaches, but this page does not include the specific methodology.

Quantitative material:
  1: "Long-term trends in mean climate increase the frequency of 2012 analogs by 11\u2013\
    16 times and the magnitude by 4\u201315% compared to changes in climate variability\
    \ only."
  3: Simulations are performed using three GCMs (GFDL-ESM4, IPSL-CM6A-LR, and UKESM1-0-LL)
    under two SSPs (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5), resulting in six different future scenarios.
  4: Coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared
    Error (RMSE) are used to evaluate model performance.
  6: In the no adaptation scenario, for SSP5-8.5, 82 annual yield values are at or
    below the 2012 yield; for SSP1-2.6, 43 analogs are observed. Mean production losses
    are 17% larger than the original event for the SSP5-8.5%, and 6% for the SSP1-2.6
    (no adaptation). Adaptation scenario shows 9 analogs, four for SSP1-2.6 and five
    for SSP5-8.5. SSP5-8.5 and SSP1-2.6 mean losses are 2.3% and 2.2% larger than
    the 2012 event (adaptation).
  7: "Quantitative losses in soybean production are provided: a decrease of \u2212\
    1.5 Mt for the U.S., \u22120.5 Mt for Brazil, and \u22120.6 Mt for Argentina in\
    \ the adaptation scenario compared to the 2012 event."
  8: "Average losses associated with country-level analogs increase by \u22122.7 Mt\
    \ (\u22123.1 Mt, \u22122.2 Mt) in the US, \u22122.5 Mt (\u22123.7 Mt, \u22121.4\
    \ Mt) in Brazil, and \u22122.4 Mt (\u22123.2 Mt, \u22121.6 Mt) in Argentina with\
    \ respect to the corresponding country-level losses observed in 2012."
  9: The frequency and magnitude of impacts analogous to the 2012 event increase with
    high-emission scenarios; adaptation reduces the frequency of such impacts 11 to
    16 times and their intensity by 4% to 15% under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios.
  11: Box plots visually display distributions of historical precipitation and temperature
    anomalies.
  12: No change in the joint occurrence of extreme soybean losses in the Americas
    due to climate variability is evident from simulations.
