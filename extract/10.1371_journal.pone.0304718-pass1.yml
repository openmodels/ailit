Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (warming, sea ice concentration changes, net primary production
    changes) and future socio-economic pathways (SSPs).
  6: Changes in the abundance of fish stocks driven by redistribution of fishery resources.
  8: Climate change (warming scenarios SSP585), sea ice loss, changes in sea bottom
    and surface temperatures, shifts of marine resources.
  9: "Changes in summer sea bottom temperature (SSBT), winter sea bottom temperature\
    \ (WSBT), winter sea surface temperature (WSST), winter sea ice concentration\
    \ (WSIC), and summer net primary production (SNPP) between present (2000\u2013\
    2019) and future periods (2021\u20132100) under the SSP585 scenario."
  12: Climate change (specifically, the SSP585 scenario), leading to redistribution
    of fishery resources.
  14: Climate change impacts, including changes in sea surface and bottom temperatures,
    sea ice concentration, and primary production, are impacting the distribution
    and abundance of marine fauna.
  15: Future climate change; extreme warming; sea ice loss; changes in catch composition;
    shifting marine resources.
  17: Climate change leading to redistribution of fishery resources, increases in
    marine fisheries resources in NEBS and Chukchi Sea, movement of fish stocks out
    of traditional fishing grounds, declines in winter sea ice and summer cold pool
    extent in the EBS, poleward shifts in abundance and distribution of warm-adapted
    taxa
  18: Climate-driven changes in species abundance, catch, revenue, and profit.
Highlights:
  1: Future redistribution of fishery resources suggests biological and economic trade-offs
    according to the severity of the emission scenario.
  8: Species COGs are projected to shift northwards and result in large shifts in
    the optimal habitat due to significant sea ice loss and warming in the EBS under
    the extreme socio-economic pathway (SSP585).
  9: The study projects changes in key oceanographic and biological variables, indicating
    potential shifts in fishery resources and associated economic impacts.
  12: Climate change is projected to cause redistribution of fishery resources, with
    varying impacts on maximum catch potential, revenue, and profit potential, depending
    on the climate scenario and time horizon. The Chukchi Sea shows increased abundance
    of high-catch, low-economic value taxa under SSP585.
  14: Significant and steep declines in maximum revenue potentials and maximum profit
    potentials are projected under high climate scenarios (SSP585), with contrasting
    trends for different climate scenarios.
  15: "Future changes in catch composition can alter the potential economic benefits\
    \ from fisheries; projected increases in MCP in the NEBS and Chukchi Sea under\
    \ the extreme warming and sea ice loss scenario in 2081\u20132100 did not result\
    \ into significant increases in Marginal Revenue Product (MRP) and Marginal Profit\
    \ Potential (MPP); changes in MCP relative to distance from ports are likely to\
    \ impact the future fishing fleet mobility."
  17: Climate change impacts are expected to alter the distribution of fish stocks
    between US and Russian EEZs, potentially leading to governance and management
    issues, fishery conflicts, overexploitation, and shifts to lower-value species.
  18: Well-managed marine ecosystems can have limited economic impact in the near-term
    under low to moderate climatic changes.
Methodology:
  1: "Projections of future changes in the abundance of eight commercially important\
    \ fish and crab species under different CMIP6 Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)\
    \ leading to contrasting future (2021\u20132100) scenarios."
  6: The paper computes MSY, MCP, revenue, and profit based on equations using projected
    species abundance, reference exploitation rates, and ex-vessel prices. Calculations
    are performed for the present-day period (2000-2019) and future periods (2021-2100).
    Assumes constant prices and costs over time, while acknowledging limitations of
    this assumption.
  8: Bioeconomic changes between US and Russian waters of the Eastern Bering Sea are
    explored to examine the potential impact of future shifts of marine resources
    to fishing fleet dynamics; BSAI bioeconomic parameters are used; high aggregated
    fishing effort over the last nine years (2012-2020) is used to identify present-day
    fishing grounds; species-specific models account for 55%-87% of variance in species
    abundance from 2000-2019
  9: Spatial distributions of climate variables are modeled under the SSP585 scenario
    for various future time periods (2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2061-2080, 2081-2100) and
    compared to the baseline period (2000-2019).
  12: Spatial distribution analysis of species abundance and potential catch, revenue,
    and profit under different climate scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585)
    for present (2000-2019) and future (2041-2060; 2081-2100) periods.
  15: Implementation of simple bioeconomic analyses to spatio-temporal projections
    of species abundance; comparison of future averaged MCPs with distance away from
    major fishing and Arctic ports.
  17: Scenario-based projections of climate changes impacting commercially-exploited
    fisheries in the EBS and Chukchi Sea are made using models and scenarios. The
    analysis uses machine learning models to predict species-specific biomass and
    biological parameters from US BSAI species stocks.
  18: Analysis based on projections solely driven by changes in species abundance
    due to climate change; used fixed economic parameters based on published regional
    values.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the eastern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea.
  6: The paper acknowledges that the assumption of constant prices and costs is a
    limitation, as changes in subsidies, fuel prices, aquaculture, and demand for
    seafood could affect these parameters in the future.
  8: The study uses data from the global fishing watch online repository (https://globalfishingwatch.org/data-download/datasets/public-fishing-effort).
  9: "The results are specific to the SSP585 scenario, and figures for other scenarios\
    \ can be found in S3-S5 Figs in S1 File. The cold pool feature (SSBT < 2\u02DA\
    C) and bathymetric contours are also overlaid on the SSBT maps."
  12: The study focuses on the Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and Chukchi Sea regions, using
    scenarios like SSP585 to project future changes in fishery resources. The redistribution
    of resources involves trade-offs between biological and economic factors.
  15: The study area is the Eastern Bering Sea; The reference covers projections until
    2100.
  17: The paper focuses on the impact of climate change on fisheries resources and
    the implications for fishing communities, governance, and ecological stability.
    It highlights the uncertainties associated with model projections and the limitations
    of the analysis, including the use of simple biological and economic assumptions.

  5: This page focuses on modeling the biological and economic impacts on fisheries
    due to climate change in the Bering Sea, not macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes
    at a national level. It primarily discusses changes in fish biomass and maximum
    sustainable yield (MSY) under different climate scenarios.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Changes in productivity of commercial and subsistence fisheries.
  6: "The paper computes revenue (R) and profit (\u03C0) for each species of fish\
    \ and for all species combined, to assess the economic impacts of potential abundance\
    \ changes. Also computes maximum revenue potential (MRP), which is defined as\
    \ the total potential income from the catches of all species stocks."

  9: Future redistribution of fishery resources suggests biological and economic trade-offs.
  12: Potential changes in revenue and profit potential from fisheries.
  15: Potential biological and economic impacts of future climate change on major
    commercial fisheries; potential economic benefits from fisheries; present and
    future revenue and profit potential from fisheries; impact on the future fishing
    fleet mobility.
  17: Potential declines and/or extirpation of cold-adapted species of high economic
    value, leading to a switch to low-value commercially-targeted species; changes
    to landings of walleye pollock and Pacific cod within the US EEZ; potential for
    conservation concerns for salmon and halibut due to by-catch

    Chukchi Sea.
  6: "The paper provides equations for calculating Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY),\
    \ Maximum Catch Potential (MCP), Revenue (R), and, presumably, Profit (\u03C0\
    ). It uses species-specific population growth rates, species abundance from ensemble\
    \ models, and exploitation rates."

    \ percent differences in MCP, MRP (maximum revenue potential), and MPP (maximum\
    \ profit potential) relative to the present-day period (2000\u20132019) were also\
    \ highest during the late-century (2081\u20132100) under SSP585."

    \ (km)."
  17: No explicit quantitative estimates of macroeconomic or fiscal variables are
    presented, but the text refers to changes in species abundance and distributions,
    which implicitly has economic value associated with it.
