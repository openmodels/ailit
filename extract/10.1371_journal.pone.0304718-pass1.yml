Drivers of Risk:
  1: Warming, sea ice concentration, and net primary production changes due to different
    CMIP6 Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs).
  3: Changes in species distributions and abundances are driven by record-breaking
    changes in temperature and sea ice in the Arctic and surrounding marine areas.
  5: Fluctuations in future climate and primary productivity impact fish biomass.
  6: Changes in species-specific population growth rates, abundance, and exploitation
    rates influence maximum catch potential.
  8: Physical variables and primary production showed changes between present and
    future periods under different scenarios, with a prominent contrast under the
    highest warming scenario (SSP585). The cold pool declined and disappeared during
    2021-2040 and 2081-2100, respectively. Winter sea bottom and surface temperatures
    warmed, and winter sea ice was lost. Summer integrated primary production also
    declined. Environmental variables including depth, bottom temperatures, and summer
    net primary production were important factors influencing species distribution
    and abundance.
  9: Summer sea bottom temperature (SSBT), winter sea bottom temperature (WSBT), winter
    sea surface temperature (WSST), winter sea ice concentration (WSIC), and summer
    net primary production (SNPP) under the SSP585 scenario.
  10: Climate change scenarios SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585 are used to model
    future abundance and shifts in the center of gravity (COG) of commercial fish
    species.
  11: Changes in spatial distributions of fishery resources are driven by climate
    change scenarios under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs).
  12: Climate scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585)
  13: Changes in abundance and shifts in species distribution (e.g., snow crab, Greenland
    halibut), influenced by climate scenarios.
  14: Future redistribution of fishery resources driven by climate change, specifically
    changes in sea surface and bottom temperatures, sea ice concentration, and primary
    production.
  15: Future climate change, extreme warming, sea ice loss.
  16: Shifting fish abundance in response to climate change.
  17: Climate changes are a continuing risk for fisheries conflicts. Declines in winter
    sea ice and summer cold pool extent in the EBS increase predation intensity on
    juvenile walleye pollock by groundfish predators. Poleward shifts in warm-adapted
    taxa are disruptive to the ecological stability of Arctic marine ecosystems.
  18: Climate-driven changes in species abundance and future climate and shared socioeconomic
    pathways. Persistent regional uncertainties in projections of ocean net primary
    production (NPP).

Highlights:
  1: Species abundance and distribution changes show potential winners and losers
    under future climate change, with the least changes under SSP126 and significant
    changes (Pacific cod increase, snow crab decrease) under SSP585.
  4: Machine learning algorithms often outperform conventional regression models in
    predicting species distribution and abundance, as the former are able to better
    capture complexity and are more flexible relative to the latter.
  5: Projects future species abundance and estimates MSY, exploring the biological
    and economic implications of climate-driven changes in the Bering Sea-Aleutian
    Island (BSAI) area.
  7: Sensitivity analysis results suggest the findings are robust across different
    assumptions on prices and costs over time.
  8: Under future conditions, the COGs of abundance for all species are projected
    to shift northwards. There will be increasing overlap in areas of peak abundance
    within the present-day fishing grounds in both the US and Russia.
  9: Shows a clear pattern of environmental change over time, emphasizing warming
    ocean temperatures, potential changes in sea ice extent, and varying primary production
    levels in the Gulf of Alaska.
  10: Maps visualize potential future changes in marine habitats due to climate change,
    demonstrating how different scenarios might impact fish distribution in the Bering
    Sea and adjacent regions.
  11: Significant potential abundance declines and subsequent collapse are observed
    for high economic value species like snow crab and Greenland halibut under SSP585
    scenario.
  12: Projected changes in cumulative maximum catch potential were lowest under SSP126,
    moderate under SSP245 and SSP370, and highest under SSP585.
  13: MCPs show differences depending on the location relative to landing ports; Dutch
    Harbor shows minimal changes under SSP126 relative to SSP585; Port of Nome sees
    generally higher future MCPs under SSP126 and SSP585 than present-day.
  14: Under all SSPs, MRP and MPP are projected to decline throughout the study period.
    MCP shows more variability, with some initial increases followed by declines.
    Declines in MRPs and MPPs are steeper in SSP585 relative to SSP126.
  15: Future redistribution of fishery resources suggests biological and economic
    trade-offs. Projected increases in MCP in the NEBS and Chukchi Sea under extreme
    warming and sea ice loss did not result in significant increases in MRP (Marginal
    Revenue Product) and MPP (Marginal Physical Product), suggesting that future changes
    in catch composition can alter potential economic benefits from fisheries. Changes
    in MCP relative to distance from major fishing and Arctic ports reveal divergent
    patterns relative to the present, likely impacting future fishing fleet mobility.
  16: High greenhouse gas emissions could lead to serious economic impacts on fisheries,
    potentially from the loss of high-value taxa, even for well-managed ecosystems
    such as the EBS.
  17: Future MRPs near the major Arctic port showed potential increases above present
    levels; northern ports may become increasingly important for local fishing communities;
    the analyses highlight the future significance of shifting marine fisheries resources
    between the US and Russian EEZ leading to potential issues for governance and
    management of transboundary fish stocks, overexploitation, and the race-to-fish.
    There is the risk of declines and/or extirpation of cold-adapted species of high
    economic value at their current distributional ranges which may also lead to a
    potential switch to low value commercially-targeted species. Enhanced geographical
    overlap in species distributional ranges could lead to elevated resource and space
    competition, increased predation pressures, density-dependent population changes,
    overfishing of less productive taxa, and increased by-catch of non-target species.
  18: "For well-managed marine ecosystems like the EBS, the effects of climate change\
    \ can have limited economic impact in the near-term (2021\u20132040) under low\
    \ to moderate levels of climatic changes. Mitigation and conservation efforts\
    \ could demand changes in current conservation and management strategies. Forward-looking\
    \ and climate-smart solutions are necessary to manage, conserve, and rebuild marine\
    \ fisheries resources."

Methodology:
  1: "Future changes are projected using different CMIP6 Shared Socio-economic Pathways\
    \ (SSPs) leading to contrasting future (2021\u20132100) scenarios."
  3: The analysis is based on integrating historical and future climate data from
    various online repositories, including NOAA and CMEMS, and uses down-scaled CMIP6
    GCMs for future projections under different Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs).
  5: Uses ensemble model predictions/projections of species abundance (weighted average
    of RF and BRT models) under four alternative shared socio-economic pathways (SSP126,
    SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585) for two future periods (2061-2080 and 2081-2100).  Assumes
    present-day abundances are at carrying capacity and future changes reflect biomass
    changes.  Calculates maximum sustainable yield (MSY) using model outputs of species-specific
    abundance within the US exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the EBS, applying historical
    biological reference values of species-specific population growth rate and scaling
    parameter.
  6: "The study projects future Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) at 20-year intervals\
    \ using a Pella-Tomlinson yield curve and calculates maximum catch potential (MCP)\
    \ based on model-derived species biomass and reference exploitation rates. Economic\
    \ variables are computed assuming constant prices and costs over time. Data timeframes\
    \ vary between 36- and 61-year periods (1949\u20132013) and are standardized to\
    \ a common baseline year (2012)."
  7: Sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the impact of different price and
    cost scenarios on economic outcomes.
  8: Bioeconomic changes between present-day fishing grounds within the US and Russian
    waters of the Eastern Bering Sea were explored to examine the impact of future
    shifts of marine resources to fishing fleet dynamics. Present-day fishing grounds
    were identified as pixels of high aggregated fishing effort over the last nine
    years (>= 1000 fishing hrs) using annually aggregated fishing effort available
    from 2012 to 2020 from the global fishing watch online repository.
  9: Uses the SSP585 scenario to project future changes.
  10: Modeled abundance used to compute taxon-specific COGs throughout the basin;
    COGs were mapped, even on land, for species with abundance close to coasts (e.g.,
    snow crab, yellowfin sole, Greenland halibut, and Alaska plaice).
  12: "Spatial abundance distributions of different catch and value species are modeled\
    \ for present (2000\u20132019) and future (2041\u20132060; 2081\u20132100) periods\
    \ under the SSP585 scenario."
  13: Analysis of MCP under different SSPs, comparing changes relative to present-day
    conditions. Results are spatially resolved, showing differences by region and
    proximity to major landing ports.
  14: The analysis uses CMIP6 projections of climate and productivity to model future
    changes in fisheries. Results are applicable to the study area under the specified
    SSPs and time periods.
  15: Simple bioeconomic analyses are applied to spatio-temporal projections of species
    abundance. MCP (Minimum Convex Polygon) is computed at each 100-km buffer zone
    from Dutch Harbor and Port of Nome. Results are applicable to the Eastern Bering
    Sea fisheries, comparing present (2000-2019) and future (2021-2100) periods.
  16: Analysis used fishing mortality rates at healthy levels.
  17: Scenario-based projections of climate change impacts on fisheries in the EBS
    and Chukchi Sea were made using simple biological and economic assumptions, including
    machine learning models to represent species-specific biomass. Published species-specific
    biological parameters for the US BSAI species stocks were used to compute biological
    estimates for the present-day and future periods, assuming these parameters remain
    constant.
  18: The study uses economic analysis as a simple first-cut attempt to elucidate
    the potential impacts, relying on projected species abundance changes under future
    climate and shared socioeconomic pathways. Economic parameters like ex-vessel
    prices and fishing costs, based on published regional values, were assumed constant
    over time. The study considers climate scenarios for future time periods (e.g.,
    2021-2040).
  19: No relevant information.
More Notes:
  1: Fishing at the same distance from Dutch Harbor under SSP585 could lead to declining
    catches of valuable fisheries due to distributional shifts, despite minimal declines
    in maximum catch potential.
  5: The study acknowledges that biotic interactions and diseases, unaccounted for
    in the analysis, can influence species biomass and carrying capacity.
  9: The analysis uses maps with color gradients and scales to visualize and represent
    oceanographic data over time, focusing on the Gulf of Alaska. Other scenarios
    are evaluated as well, but not shown in this figure.
  10: The analysis focuses on shifts in the center of gravity of fish populations
    as a key indicator of climate-driven redistribution.
  12: Increases in the Chukchi Sea were accounted for by increases in the abundance
    of high catch and low economic value taxa (i.e., yellowfin sole and walleye pollock).
  13: Analysis considers changes in maximum catch, revenue, and profit potential for
    different present-day fishing grounds in U.S. and Russian waters.
  14: The study notes that increases in MCP do not always translate to increases in
    MRP and MPP. The analysis considers potential winners and losers under climate
    change, potentially leading to a restructuring of marine communities in the Pacific
    Arctic region.
  15: The study uses SSP126 and SSP585 scenarios. Figures show locations of fishing
    ports and MCP within the US EEZ. The analysis considers the economic value of
    shifting marine resources influencing revenue and profit potential from fisheries.
