  7: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Long-term environmental impacts, including climate change, ecosystem damages,
    and air pollution.
  6: Discount rates and time horizons used in cost-benefit analysis.
  7: Choice of discount rate; Length of time horizon in analysis; Failure to adequately
    include environmental costs and benefits; Greenhouse gas emissions; Impacts on
    biodiversity.
Highlights:
  1: Time horizon can greatly affect Cost-Benefit Analysis results, often more than
    the discount rate.
  6: Lower discount rates and longer time horizons significantly increase the estimated
    net benefits of projects. Moving from a 7% to a 3% discount rate over 25 years
    increases net benefits by 48.84%. Moving to a Stern discount rate of 1.4% or a
    zero discount rate further increases the discounted net benefits by 79.07% and
    93.92% respectively, compared to the 7% rate.
  7: Extending the time horizon can be more significant than reducing the discount
    rate, even to zero, for public project analysis. Shorter time horizons may lead
    to a 'pessimism bias' for environmentally beneficial projects and an 'optimism
    bias' for environmentally damaging projects.
Methodology:
  1: Time horizon in Cost-Benefit Analysis significantly impacts outcomes, suggesting
    use of scenarios and sensitivity testing for long-term effects (100+ years).
  6: Cost-benefit analysis using different discount rates and time horizons. The analysis
    considers constant annual benefit flows. Compares different time horizons, in
    line with OECD best practices and EU guidance on CBA.
  7: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) with varying discount rates and time horizons; Considers
    constant flow of benefits under different discount rates; Residual calculation
    to capture long-term externalities; Scenario and sensitivity analysis to address
    uncertainty.
More Notes:
  1: The importance of including long-term environmental impacts and using appropriate
    time horizons in economic evaluations to avoid bias towards environmentally damaging
    projects.
  6: The paper uses a constant annual benefit flow of $1000 to illustrate the impact
    of different time horizons and discount rates. The choice of discount rate has
    a considerable effect on the discounted net benefits.
  7: The paper advocates for longer time horizons (100+ years) in CBA for environmental
    impacts, depending on the type of environmental damage. The inclusion of environmental
    impacts requires early consideration during the scoping and screening phase to
    identify and quantify them.
  8: The paper argues for the enhancement and improvement of Cost-Benefit Analysis
    (CBA) to respond to environmental challenges, including encompassing long-term
    time horizons for analysis of environmental costs and benefits. The author, T.
    O' Mahony, is listed.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes quantitatively mentioned.
  6: Net benefits of adaptation, measured in USD.
  7: Net welfare loss/gain; Benefit-cost ratio; Accounting for the benefit flows from
    public projects; Economic analysis of environmental benefits and avoided damages.
Quantitative material:
  1: No concrete quantitative information on outcomes of interest.
  6: Table 2 shows the effect of time horizon (25, 50, 100, 120 years) and discount
    rates (7%, 5%, 3%, 1.4%, 0%) on a constant long-term flow of $1000 USD per annum.
    For example, at a 25-year horizon, the present value of $1000/year is $11,719
    at a 7% discount rate and $25,000 at a 0% discount rate.
