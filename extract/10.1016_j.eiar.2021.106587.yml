Drivers of Risk:
  1: Environmental costs and benefits accruing in the long-term; Carbon-intensive
    or environmentally damaging projects.
  2: No relevant information
  3: The document doesn't directly discuss specific drivers of climate change risk,
    but it mentions environmental impacts in general, as well as externalities like
    reduced air pollution and greenhouse gasses.
  4: Emission or avoidance of greenhouse gases from energy and transport projects,
    projects that may have high initial capital investment, but generate long-term
    streams of benefits, and decomposition of waste in a landfill.
  6: No relevant information
  7: Environmental costs and benefits through greenhouse gas emissions, climate change
    impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems, public project costs and benefits
Evaluation overview:
  1: The paper focuses on the environmental impacts of projects and policies, particularly
    those related to air pollution, climate change, and ecosystem damages.
  2: No relevant information
  3: The page discusses the application of Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) to environmental
    projects and policies, focusing on the valuation of environmental costs and benefits,
    discounting rates, and equity considerations.
  4: The welfare impacts of public investments, environmental externalities (air pollution,
    greenhouse gas emissions, climate change adaptation, damage to ecosystems), and
    project impacts (safety and efficiency benefits of projects like rail transport).
  6: No relevant information
  7: Environmental benefits and avoided damages, welfare (including intergenerational
    wealth transfer)
Highlights:
  1: The time horizon in Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) can significantly impact results,
    even more so than the discount rate. For projects with long-term environmental
    effects, timescales of 100+ years are recommended for economic evaluation. Failing
    to capture these long-term welfare gains and losses will bias analysis towards
    carbon-intensive or environmentally damaging projects.
  2: The paper emphasizes the importance of integrating sustainability science and
    environmental impacts into CBA. It argues that environmental considerations should
    be fundamental to the framing of public investment analysis and that aggregate
    analyses of planetary boundaries are necessary. It stresses that marginal gains
    in economic efficiency at the project level cannot be traded for an unsustainable
    pathway at the aggregate level.
  3: 'Key highlights include: the need to mainstream sustainability into government
    institutions, the trend towards lower and declining discount rates in CBA, the
    importance of valuing ecosystem services and co-benefits, the necessity of addressing
    equity considerations in CBA, and the influence of the time horizon on CBA outcomes.'
  4: Long time horizons are necessary to capture important long-term costs and benefits
    to welfare in CBA. Ignoring long-term impacts is ethically indefensible. Uncertainty
    in forecasting future costs and benefits and the impact of the discount rate influence
    the choice of time horizons.
  5: Highlights the importance of long-term time horizons in CBA to capture environmental
    costs and benefits, particularly for climate change risks and intergenerational
    wealth transfers.
  6: The impact on discounted net benefits is considerable when changing discount
    rates.
  7: "Extending the time horizon in CBA can be more significant than reducing discount\
    \ rates, particularly for projects with long-term environmental impacts; shorter\
    \ time horizons may introduce a \u2018pessimism bias\u2019 for environmentally\
    \ beneficial projects and an \u2018optimism bias\u2019 for those that are environmentally\
    \ damaging."
Methodology:
  1: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) with emphasis on the importance of the time horizon,
    use of scenarios and sensitivity testing.
  2: This paper provides a brief review of key developments in CBA, particularly changes
    in applied practice, and focuses on the time horizon of analysis. It reviews the
    evolution of CBA driven by sustainability science, the selection of time horizons,
    uncertainty, and discounting. It includes a simple quantification of the impact
    of different time horizons and discount rates on a theoretical flow of costs and
    benefits.
  3: The methodology discussed is Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) with a focus on incorporating
    sustainability, ecosystem services valuation, and equity considerations. It also
    mentions the 'Total Economic Value' (TEV) approach for identifying and valuing
    environmental impacts.
  4: Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) is used to assess the welfare impacts of projects.
    The time horizon used in CBA can significantly affect the results. Scenario approaches
    are recommended to explore key uncertainties.
  5: Discusses Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) time horizons and discounting approaches,
    including the use of declining discount rates and sensitivity analysis.
  6: The paper quantifies the impact of different time horizons and discount rates
    on a constant annual benefit flow of $1000 USD. Social discount rates of 3%, 5%,
    and 7% are applied in a constant form, along with a 1.4% discount rate. A zero
    discount rate is also explored.
  7: Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) with varying time horizons and discount rates; compares
    different constant discount rates using a constant flow of benefits; review of
    national and international practices for project appraisal.
More Notes:
  1: The paper notes that uncertainty is a technical challenge to longer-term analysis.
  2: No relevant information
  3: 'The paper stresses that the environmental externalities to GDP per capita growth
    can be used to take into account of unit prices. '
  6: The choice of time horizon can have an extremely important effect on the results
    of the appraisal process.
  7: The paper advocates for longer time horizons (100+ years) in CBA for environmental
    impacts, similar to the technical lifetimes of long-lived infrastructure; adopting
    a longer time horizon is preferred over bundling long-term impacts into a residual
    calculation; early consideration of environmental impacts during scoping and screening
    is necessary when implementing longer time horizons.

Quantitative material:
  2: No relevant information
  3: Table 1 (adapted from OECD, 2018) provides discounting rate guidance for selected
    OECD countries, illustrating differences between short to medium-term and long-term
    rates. Example includes the United States where the discount is 3-7% for CBA projects.
  6: Moving from a 7% discount rate to a 3% discount rate increases net benefits by
    $5,723, or 48.84% over 25 years; moving to a 1.4% discount rate increases discounted
    net benefits by 79.07% and moving to 0% increases benefits by 93.92%.
  7: A constant 3% discount rate extended from 25 to 50 years has more impact on results
    than moving from 3% to 1.4%, or even to a zero discount rate.
