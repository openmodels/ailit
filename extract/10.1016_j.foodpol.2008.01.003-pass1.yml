Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate, measured as changes in country-wide rainfall and temperature, is a major
    determinant of agricultural production in SSA.
  2: Climatic changes in Sub-Saharan Africa, including rising temperatures and declining
    rainfall.
  3: Changes in rainfall and temperature (climatic changes)
  4: Sub-Saharan African agriculture is particularly sensitive to climatic changes
    due to the diversity of geographic conditions and water availability variations
    across different regions.
  5: Failure of governments and aid agencies to invest in irrigation; African climate
    (leading to high evapotranspiration rates); desertification reducing vegetative
    productivity; reduced rainfall; interaction between land-surface and atmosphere
    conditions leading to further decrease in precipitation.
  7: Climatic changes impacting agricultural production.
  8: Rainfall (R) and Temperature (T) as climatic factors
  9: Climatic changes, specifically rainfall variability, normalised by the long-term
    mean.
  10: Climatic change/climate change.
  11: Rainfall, temperature
  12: Climatic changes, specifically mean rainfall; fertilizer, tractors, agricultural
    land area
  13: Decreases in rainfall and changes in temperature have impacted agricultural
    output in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
  14: Changes in rainfall and temperature
  15: Climatic changes (rainfall and temperatures).
Highlights:
  1: Climate changes since the 1960s account for a substantial portion of the agricultural
    production gap between SSA and other developing countries.
  2: The paper highlights that climatic changes (rising temperatures and declining
    rainfall) may be a largely neglected factor contributing to the poor performance
    of the agricultural sector in Sub-Saharan Africa.
  3: Agricultural production in SSA countries has been sensitive to climatic changes
    in the latter half of the 20th century. No such effects were found for non-SSA
    developing countries.
  5: Rainfall changes cause greater precautionary savings, diverting funds from investment
    in Africa. High evapotranspiration rates and desertification exacerbate the problem,
    creating feedback loops that reduce precipitation and negatively impact agricultural
    production and economic development.
  10: The production function approach controls explicitly for other inputs but does
    not take account of the full range of compensatory responses to changes in climate
    made by farmers, which will tend to bias the coefficient on the impact on the
    agricultural sector in our production function framework downwards. The results
    must thus be viewed solely as the difference in the final net impact that climate
    change has on agricultural output rather than measuring the full impact on the
    agricultural sector.
  11: Agricultural production rising for both SSA and NSSA countries, but NSSA rose
    proportionally more from mid 1970s to mid 1980s. SSA and NSSA temperature trends
    similar. Rainfall trends differ, relatively steady in NSSA countries but peaked
    in SSA in 1960s and declined subsequently.
  12: Differences in agricultural output between SSA and NSSA may be linked to climatic
    changes (mean rainfall). Inputs such as fertilizer, tractors, and land area are
    statistically significant determinants of agricultural output. Rainfall is not
    a significant determinant of agricultural output.
  13: Changes in temperature have significantly affected variations in agricultural
    output in SSA, while rainfall decreases have reduced agricultural output.
  14: Low annual average rainfall has kept agricultural production below what it would
    have been if the long-term mean had prevailed; the increase in temperature had
    a relatively modest impact on agricultural production in SSA (compared to rainfall).
  15: Climatic changes have had important effects on total agricultural output in
    Sub-Saharan Africa, but not in other developing countries. Maintaining pre-1960s
    climate conditions would have significantly reduced the agricultural production
    gap between Sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries.
Methodology:
  1: The study uses a new cross-country panel climatic dataset in an agricultural
    production framework to examine climatic impact.
  2: The paper argues for considering climatic changes as an important factor in explaining
    the poor performance of agriculture in SSA, alongside factors like poor policies,
    institutional failures, and adverse natural resource endowments.
  3: Empirical analysis using a production function framework with cross-country data.
    The analysis focuses on the latter half of the 20th century.
  7: 'The paper specifies a simple empirical production function where agricultural
    output is a function of inputs: labor, area of land, fertilizer, capital, and
    intermediate inputs.'
  8: Fixed effects estimator applied to panel data to estimate the impact of rainfall
    and temperature on agricultural output, controlling for other inputs (labor, livestock,
    fertilizer, capital, and land) and time-varying effects.
  9: A production function approach is used with inputs including land (agricultural
    area), fertilizer (quantity of plant nutrients consumed), capital (number of agricultural
    tractors), and livestock (total head count of cattle, sheep, and goats) to assess
    the impact of climatic changes on agricultural output.
  10: Production function approach to examine the effect of climatic change on agricultural
    production.
  11: Panel data analysis from 1961-1997 for 40 Sub-Saharan African (SSA) and 67 Non-Sub-Saharan
    African (NSSA) countries. Uses five-point moving averages for climatic proxies.
  12: Empirical estimation of a model (equation 1 - not shown) with agricultural output
    as the dependent variable and inputs like land, fertilizer, and tractors as explanatory
    variables. Regression analysis is performed separately for SSA and NSSA countries.
    Rainfall proxy is included as an additional explanatory variable. t-tests are
    used to assess differences in coefficients.
  13: The analysis is performed using empirical estimates to simulate agricultural
    production in SSA with and without climatic changes, specifically considering
    pre-1960 rainfall and temperature means.
  14: Uses cross-country data on rainfall to estimate agricultural production for
    SSA under different rainfall and temperature scenarios.
  15: The authors used estimates to conduct simple simulations.
More Notes:
  3: The paper aims to address the lack of attention given to the African context
    in research on the effects of climate change on agricultural production. The authors
    attribute the contrasting results between SSA and non-SSA developing countries
    to the different nature of agricultural production across the two groups.
  8: The study uses data from 1901 to 1998 and focuses on 289 'countries' (188 states
    and 101 islands and territories). It aims to purge unobserved country-specific
    effects that may bias the estimates.
  9: The choice of inputs was constrained by the availability of comparable cross-country
    data across sub-Saharan African and other developing countries. The paper focuses
    on climatic changes rather than permanent cross-country climatic differences in
    levels.
  10: Adaptation to climatic changes was relatively low in SSA (Sub-Saharan Africa),
    potentially producing relatively little bias for the SSA nations. There is a greater
    likelihood of a downward bias for the NSSA (Non-Sub-Saharan Africa) group.
  11: Includes summary statistics for inputs L, K, and F rescaled by agricultural
    area.
  12: The paper suggests a potential issue with controlling for the quality of inputs
    (fertilizer, tractors), which are likely higher in NSSA countries. The analysis
    focuses on the period after 1960, particularly after the mid-1970s, when SSA's
    agricultural performance declined relative to NSSA.
  14: The paper focuses specifically on the impact of climate change on agricultural
    production, and does not address broader macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  15: The authors suggest policy makers should take steps to lower African agricultural
    sector's sensitivity to rainfall variations, such as improving irrigation and
    crop grazing areas.

Quantitative material:
  3: The paper measures the impact of rainfall and temperature changes on agricultural
    performance using a cross-country climatic change data set in conjunction with
    agricultural output and input data.
  5: Desertification has reduced potential vegetative productivity by 25 per cent
    for nearly a quarter of Africa's land area (according to UNEP).
  9: Agricultural output is weighted by 1989-91 average international commodity prices,
    and the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the
    base period 1989-91.
  11: Mean values of agricultural production and climatic change measure over sample
    period normalised by their initial levels in Figures 1 through 3.
  12: R-squared values suggest the empirical specifications are explaining a large
    amount of variation in the dependent variable (agricultural output). Coefficient
    on fertilizer and tractors variables for NSSA are more than double the value of
    those found for SSA. Elasticity of agricultural output to a unit increase in agricultural
    land area is substantially higher in SSA.
  14: If climatic conditions had been similar on average to the first part of the
    century, one would have observed only about 32 per cent of the increase in the
    gap of agricultural production between the two country groups.
  15: If rainfall and temperatures had remained at pre-1960s level, only 32% of the
    agricultural production gap between Sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries
    would have been observed by the end of the 20th century.
