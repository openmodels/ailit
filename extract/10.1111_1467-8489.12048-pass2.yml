Drivers of Risk:
  2: Trends in agricultural productivity; complexities introduced by climate change;
    population, incomes, biofuel use, CO2 concentrations
  4: Average per capita dietary energy intake falling below minimum requirements.
  6: Demand changes, Climate change (with and without CO2 fertilization effects)
  8: Population, per capita incomes, bioenergy policies, agricultural productivity,
    climate change.
  10: Changes in dietary energy consumption (DEC) distribution due to climate change
    impacts
  11: Stagnant agricultural productivity (Total Factor Productivity - TFP) growth
  12: Climate change impacts on crop yields (temperature and precipitation), CO2 fertilization
    effects.
  13: Climate change (yield impacts), CO2 fertilization, population growth, income
    growth, TFP (Total Factor Productivity) growth, biofuel use.
  14: Population growth, increased biofuel use, and climate change all contribute
    to greater food insecurity on a global level.
  15: Population growth, income, TFP (Total Factor Productivity), increased biofuel
    use, climate change.
  16: Population, TFP, per capita income, biofuels, and climate change
Highlights:
  2: The paper quantifies the prevalence and depth of food insecurity, validates a
    food security module against historical data, and decomposes historical and projected
    drivers of food security, emphasizing the contribution of agricultural productivity
    and climate change.
  6: Climate change increases malnutrition in some scenarios, particularly sub-Saharan
    Africa.
  8: The growing importance of per capita income as a key driver of food demand, especially
    in developing regions.
  10: Globally, the volume of food consumption increases by about 31% between 2006
    and 2050, mainly from livestock and processed foods. Food prices in all regions
    are declining in 2050 under the baseline scenario.
  11: Improvements in nutritional outcomes are severely dampened if agricultural productivity
    stagnates; malnutrition incidence rises significantly in sub-Saharan Africa, Central
    America, and South East Asia under stagnant productivity; rising food prices due
    to lack of productivity growth disproportionately affect lower-income consumers.
  12: Climate change, without CO2 fertilization, increases global malnutrition incidence
    by about 16 per cent relative to the baseline. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia
    see a more than 20 per cent increase in malnutrition prevalence. CO2 fertilization
    leads to higher crop yields and improvements in food security.
  13: Climate change can either enhance or dampen improvements in nutritional outcomes
    depending on the strength of CO2 fertilization. Climate change could have significant
    implications on nutritional outcomes of millions of people, particularly in hunger-stricken
    regions. Impacts of climate change are magnified in lower-income regions.
  14: TFP growth and per capita income growth are key drivers of reduction in malnutrition
    headcount globally.
  15: Population growth is a more significant driver of global malnutrition than biofuel
    use or climate change (without CO2 fertilization), although climate change still
    poses significant risks in the poorest regions.
  16: Future nutritional outcomes will be mainly affected by socio-economic conditions
    as well as productivity trends in the agricultural sector. Climate change will
    still be a relevant driver of nutritional outcomes especially for those residing
    in regions of the world where chronic malnutrition is prevalent.
Methodology:
  2: Uses a model of global agriculture to project changes in crop production and
    food consumption and a food security module to extrapolate nutritional outcomes.
    Model is validated against past data.
  4: Uses the concept of poverty-growth elasticities, assuming a lognormal distribution
    of per capita dietary energy consumption. Applies to analyze changes in malnutrition
    indices in response to changes in average dietary energy intake.
  6: The paper uses a model, not fully specified on this page, to project food security
    statistics under different scenarios. The results are applicable to 2050 based
    on 2006 data.
  8: Model-based scenario analysis to assess future global food security. Scenarios
    include baseline (population, per capita income growth, biofuel use, productivity
    improvements), 'Demand only' (stagnant agricultural productivity), 'No CO2 fert.'
    (climate change yield effects without CO2 fertilization), and 'CO2 fert.' (climate
    change yield effects with CO2 fertilization).
  10: The reduction in malnutrition is determined by comparing caloric distribution
    curves between 2006 and 2050. Baseline scenario analysis projects food consumption
    changes.
  11: Scenario analysis comparing a baseline scenario with a 'Demand only' scenario
    where supply-side drivers (agricultural productivity growth) are ignored, projecting
    to 2050
  12: Simulation of nutritional outcomes in 2050 based on crop yield impacts of climate
    change, with and without CO2 fertilization.
  13: Simulation of changes in malnutrition count for historical period (1991-2001)
    and a 'Climate Change no CO2 fert.' scenario.
  14: Decomposition analysis of scenarios focusing on various contributing factors
    to global malnutrition, applicable from 2006 to 2050.
  15: Uses the SIMPLE model with a food security module to project food security outcomes
    in 2050, given projected trends in the underlying drivers of the world farm and
    food system. Model is evaluated based on an historical experiment from 1991 to
    2001.
More Notes:
  6: The model may have inconsistencies due to domestic agricultural policies, foreign
    trade agreements, and other barriers to international trade. Central Asia's economic
    transition is noted as a factor affecting food security. The paper acknowledges
    that the model failed to accurately capture the distribution of crop production
    across regions.
  8: The model, SIMPLE, captures productivity improvements through growth in total
    factor productivity (TFP). TFP growth in crops is assumed input neutral, while
    in livestock and processed food it is input-biased towards non-crop inputs.
  10: Agricultural productivity growth may exceed growth in future food demand due
    to rising population and incomes.
  11: Consumer responses to income and prices decline as per capita income rises,
    and declines faster for crops relative to livestock and processed foods.
  12: The effect of climate change on food security is evident in the prevalence of
    malnutrition.
  15: The model's performance is less satisfactory at the regional level, particularly
    in South Asia.
  16: The impact of climate change on future nutritional outcomes is uncertain, depending
    on the strength of the yield impacts of CO2 fertilization.

Quantitative material:
  4: "Presents equations (1) and (2) to calculate growth elasticities for the malnutrition\
    \ index (\u025BMI) and the malnutrition gap index (\u025BMGI), linking them to\
    \ changes in average dietary energy intake."
  6: Table 1 provides quantitative data for the outcomes of interest under baseline
    (2006) and future scenarios (2050).
  10: Figure 2 shows probability densities of dietary energy consumption for South
    Asia and Australia/New Zealand in 2006 and 2050. Figure 3 shows composition of
    food consumption in 2006 and 2050, with global food consumption increasing by
    about 31%.
  11: Malnutrition prevalence exceeds baseline by more than four times (7.9% vs. 1.9%);
    Sub-Saharan Africa malnutrition headcount rises by 193 million relative to baseline;
    global malnutrition count declines slightly to 729 million people; food consumption
    increases by around 56 to 75 percent in Central Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and South
    Asia.
  12: Without CO2 fertilization, global yields will decline by around 1.3 per cent
    per decade. With CO2 fertilization, crop yields are higher (by 2.2 per cent per
    decade globally).
  13: With CO2 fertilization, global malnutrition incidence declines by 20 per cent
    relative to the baseline. The number of malnourished persons globally further
    declines by around 35 million relative to the baseline with CO2 fertilization
    effects. Population growth alone contributed to an increase in the global malnutrition
    count by 266 million persons between 1991-2001. Income growth reduced malnutrition
    by 47% the amount it was increased by population growth, and TFP growth reduced
    it by 109% the amount it was increased by population growth.
  14: Quantitative data on malnutrition count changes across regions and the impact
    of factors like population growth, TFP growth, and climate change without CO2
    fertilization from 2006 to 2050.
  15: Increased biofuel use has roughly 6 per cent of the contribution of population
    growth on global malnutrition count. Climate change (no CO2 fertilization) has
    around 16 per cent of the contribution of population on the changes in the malnutrition
    count.
  16: From 1991 to 2001, population and TFP were the dominant drivers of malnutrition
    count. Impact of population on malnutrition headcount exceeds that of per capita
    income at the global level. Going forward to 2050, the relative impact of population
    on malnutrition count will be offset by the relative contribution of per capita
    income and TFP growth.
