Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change
  2: Changes in precipitation, carbon dioxide emissions, and temperature
  3: COVID-19 epidemic and Climate change (temperature increases, changes in humidity,
    floods, droughts, and unpredictable weather conditions) are impacting tourism.
  5: Temperature, precipitation, and CO2 emissions, coral reef degradation.
  6: CO2 emissions, Precipitation, Temperatures, Gross capital formation, Arable land
  7: Variables like CO2 emissions (LCO2), precipitation (LPRECIPITATION), temperature
    (LTASMEAN), gross domestic investment (LGDITOTL), and land use (LLAND) impact
    international tourism.
  8: Average annual temperatures, gross capital formation, percentage of arable land,
    carbon dioxide emissions, rainfall
  9: Climate change indicators (including CO2, average temperature, and land area)
    are the drivers of risk.
  10: Carbon dioxide emissions (negative impact on tourism revenues), climate change
    (long-term impact on tourism), temperatures (positive relationship with rainfall),
    energy consumption causing greenhouse gas emissions.
Highlights:
  2: Carbon dioxide emissions have a long-term negative impact on international tourism
    revenues in Egypt.
  3: The tourism sector in Egypt is negatively impacted by the effects of the COVID-19
    epidemic and is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
  5: Climate change negatively impacts tourism revenues in Egypt.
  7: The model is significant with an F-statistic significant at a level below 5%.
  8: Long-run inverse relationship between international tourism and carbon dioxide
    emissions; long-run positive relationship between international tourism and gross
    capital formation and percentage of arable land; short-term correlation between
    the international tourism index and average annual temperatures, gross capital
    formation, and the percentage of arable land.
  9: There is a cointegration relationship between climate change indicators and international
    tourism, suggesting environmental changes impact tourism revenues.
  10: Carbon dioxide emissions have a significant negative long-term impact on international
    tourism revenues. Climate change has a long-term impact on tourism due to its
    impact on tourist seasons and tourist attractions. The study also found a positive
    relationship between temperatures and rainfall in the short and long term.
Methodology:
  1: Empirical analysis related to the impact of climate change on international tourism
    in Egypt.
  2: Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model used to investigate short and long-run
    estimates.
  5: This study models international tourism revenues as a function of climate variables
    (temperature, precipitation, and CO2 emissions), using an empirical model with
    variables like tourism revenue, CO2 emissions, precipitation, temperature, GDP,
    land area.
  6: The study uses an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to investigate
    both the short-and long-term relationships between climate change and international
    tourism. The ARDL technique is used because it can separate the long-term effects
    from the short-term effects and can be used regardless of whether the underlying
    variables are purely I(0), I(1), or mutually co-integrated. The Phillips-Perron
    (PP) unit root test is used to test for the stability of time series data and
    determine if variables are stationary at level I(0) or first difference I(1).
  7: Analysis performed using the ARDL model; involves cointegration and error correction
    to assess relationship between variables from 1990 to 2020.
  8: 'Autoregressive Distributed Lagged (ARDL) model for both short-run and long-run
    estimates, ARDL bounds testing for cointegration, Diagnostic tests: Autoregressive
    conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH), Breusch-Godfrey serial correlation LM test,
    Normality distribution (Jarque-Bera), Stability of short run model (CUSM-CUSM
    square test), Predictive Capacity Test of the Unrestricted Error Correction Model'
  9: Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model is used to examine the impact of
    climate change on international tourism from 1990 to 2020 in Egypt. Error correction
    model (ECM) is also estimated.
  10: The study used an unrestricted error correction model. Cointegration relationship
    was found between the international tourism index and independent variables.
More Notes:
  1: The page provides metadata about a research article and general terms of use
    rather than specific findings.
  2: Study focuses specifically on Egypt.
  3: The study aims to investigate the impact of climate change on international tourism
    in Egypt, complementing prior literature due to a lack of research on the effects
    of climate change on the Egyptian tourist sector.
  5: The study aims to address the gap in research on the impact of climate change
    on Egyptian tourism, focusing on the impact of climate variables on tourism revenues
    rather than the other way around.
  6: The dependent variable is International tourism, revenues (% of total exports).
    Unit root tests are performed to ensure the stability of time series before applying
    ARDL modeling.
  7: The Durbin-Watson statistic suggests no spurious relationship; stationary tests
    confirm residuals and variables are appropriate for the model.
  8: The model is deemed structurally stable during the study period based on CUSUM
    and CUSUM of Squares tests, and it is deemed to have predictive power according
    to the Theil Inequality Coefficient.
  9: The model is considered free of major problems and reliable for economic analysis,
    forecasting, and policymaking. Gross capital formation is confirmed as an important
    macroeconomic indicator.
  10: The paper focuses on Egypt.

Quantitative material:
  2: Study period is 1990-2020; Two climate variables (precipitation rate and temperature)
    have a positive but not significant impact on international tourism revenue; Carbon
    dioxide emissions have a long-term negative impact on international tourism revenues.
  3: Tourist arrivals in Egypt reported roughly 4 million visitors in 2020-2021 compared
    to 9.24 million visitors in 2019 (a 56.7% decline). Tourism revenues in Egypt
    dropped from $9.85 billion in 2019-2020 to $4.86 billion in 2020-2021.
  5: A United Nations Development Program report predicted a 20% decrease in annual
    tourist arrivals for Egypt in 2060, reducing tourism revenues by (13-17) billion
    pounds annually. Tourism losses due to coral reef degradation would be around
    19 billion pounds in 2030 and 85 billion pounds in 2060 (Smith et al., 2013, attributed
    this information to the UNDP report).
  7: Model explains 71% of changes in tourism (Adjusted R2 = 0.71).
  8: F-statistics for ARDL bounds testing = 8.052331, Error correction coefficient
    = -1.835255 (implying a return to equilibrium in approximately 0.544 years), R2
    = 0.84, Theil Inequality Coefficient = 0.034, Long-run coefficients for LCO2 =
    -0.314565, LPRECIPITATION = 0.235993, LTASMEAN = 3.644415, LGDITOTL = 1.578827,
    LLAND = 1.262658
  9: Table 8 presents an error correction model with coefficients, standard errors,
    t-statistics, and probabilities for various variables including lagged tourism
    receipts (LRCPT), CO2 emissions (LCO2), average temperature (LTASMEAN), gross
    capital formation (LGDITOTL), and land area (LLAND).
  10: 1% increase in capital formation increases tourism revenues by 1.37%. Tourism-related
    investments accounted for only 0.7% of total capital investments in 2019 and 2020.
    Total GHG emissions increased by 31% between 2005 and 2015, with CO2 emissions
    accounting for 73% of total emissions. Since 1990, carbon dioxide emissions have
    increased by 141.93%.
