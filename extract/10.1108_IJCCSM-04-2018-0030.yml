Drivers of Risk:
  2: Seasonal temperature, rainfall, climate change scenarios
  3: Climate change leading to more frequent natural disasters, sharp rise in temperature,
    and changes in rainfall patterns
  5: Changes in the local climatic patterns observed by farmers over the past decades.
  7: Spatial variations in climate attributes (temperature and rainfall) impact net
    crop income. Other factors include input prices, soils, and socio-economic factors.
  8: Changes in temperature and rainfall
  9: Climate variables (wet and dry season temperatures, rainfall), climatic zones
  10: Temperature and rainfall variations in both wet and dry seasons affecting net
    crop incomes.
  11: Changes in temperature and rainfall during wet, dry, summer cropping, and winter
    cropping seasons.
  12: Temperature increase; Rainfall increase
  13: Changes in rainfall and surface temperature in Bangladesh due to climate change.
  14: Climate change (seasonal temperature and rainfall)
Highlights:
  2: Net crop income in Bangladesh is sensitive to climate, particularly to seasonal
    temperature; There will be significant seasonal and spatial variations in the
    impacts.
  3: This paper attempts to answer three important questions about the effect of climate
    change on net incomes from crop farming, the future profitability of crop farming
    under climate change scenarios, and the necessary policy steps to minimize negative
    impacts.
  7: The Ricardian model accounts for adaptation because farmers tend to adapt to
    the climate to maximize outputs and farm incomes. The model is also relatively
    easy to implement, does not require time-series data, and is flexible in considering
    major enterprise activities.
  8: The paper estimates the marginal impacts of changes in temperature and rainfall
    on net crop income using regression coefficients from the Ricardian models.
  9: Climate variables show a nonlinear relationship with net crop incomes. Wet and
    dry season temperatures showed an upward and downward trend respectively. Rainfall
    trends for wet and dry seasons were found hill-shaped.
  10: Access to irrigation and agricultural extension services significantly influences
    net crop income.
  11: Seasonal variations in temperature and rainfall are vital factors for net income
    in both cropping seasons. Net crop income is more elastic to changes in temperature
    than rainfall.
  12: Most climatic zones in Bangladesh would experience a positive effect on net
    crop incomes from a temperature increase, but some colder zones would experience
    a negative impact.
  13: Future climate change will impact net crop incomes in Bangladesh. Different
    climatic zones will not be uniformly affected. Temperature and rainfall changes
    are projected, leading to changes in net crop incomes.
  14: Farmers' current net incomes are sensitive to climate. Seasonal temperature
    has a more pronounced effect on net incomes than seasonal rainfall. Net crop income
    is more elastic to changes in temperature than rainfall, but with significant
    seasonal and spatial variations. Climate change is projected to increase net crop
    income in Bangladesh.
Methodology:
  2: Econometric model, Ricardian model
  3: Answers three questions about the impact of climate change on crop farming in
    Bangladesh; however, the authors claim existing studies are insufficient and limited
    in scope, suggesting their own research will contribute to filling this gap.
  5: Ricardian methodology is used to model the relationship between climate and agriculture.
  7: The Ricardian model is used, a cross-sectional model that assesses the performance
    of farms across landscapes, capturing impacts of climate attributes and other
    factors. It relies on the observation that land rents capture the long-term productivity
    of the farm. The model uses a quadratic formulation of climate variables.
  8: A Ricardian model is used to analyze the data. STATA (version 14.0) was used
    for the analysis. Reduced-form model used to address endogeneity. Robust estimation
    was applied to minimize heteroscedasticity. Outliers (24 households) were excluded
    based on income and farm size.
  9: Estimated models explain 3 to 16 percent of the observed variations in net crop
    income hectare. The analysis uses household characteristics variables to control
    for additional extraneous elements.
  10: Ricardian regression models used to explain net crop incomes across seven climatic
    zones in Bangladesh.
  11: The paper estimates the marginal impacts of climate variables on net crop incomes
    per hectare. The results are statistically significant (p < 0.05) for rainfall
    in the winter cropping season. The exchange rate used is US$1 = 80.64 BDT.
  12: Ricardian regression model; Examining the marginal impacts of climate across
    different climatic zones
  13: 'Uses two Coupled Atmospheric Oceanic General Circulation Models (AOGCMs): BNU-ESM
    and CanESM2, under Representative Concentration Pathway RCP8.5. Simulates daily
    surface rainfall and mean temperatures to produce estimates of monthly mean climatological
    changes for the periods 2021-2060 and 2061-2100 (relative to 1971-2005). Estimates
    impacts of climate scenarios on net incomes using a fitted net income model.'
  14: Ricardian regression model to assess the economic impacts of climate change
    on crop farming in Bangladesh.
More Notes:
  2: The study is the first attempt to measure the economic impacts of climate change
    on overall crop farming sector in Bangladesh using an econometric model.
  3: The paper highlights the vulnerability of the Bangladeshi agricultural sector
    to climate change due to its dependence on it; the authors claim that their study
    will measure the economic impacts of climate change on overall crop farming in
    Bangladesh, which they claim has not yet been done.
  5: The study area covers seven climatic zones of Bangladesh.
  7: The Ricardian model has limitations, including the possibility of omitted variable
    bias, inefficiencies of land and labor markets, and it does not account for CO2
    fertilization effects or transition costs of adaptation. The model uses net crop
    income (V) as the total crop income (farm gate price multiplied by quantity sold)
    less the total cost of production.
  8: Quadratic terms for climate variables are included to capture nonlinear relationships,
    with U-shaped or hill-shaped forms depending on the sign of the coefficient. The
    paper accounts for other variables, although age and distance to market are omitted
    from the final model.
  12: Adaptation techniques undertaken by farmers in the study area may explain the
    positive effect of temperature rise on net incomes.
  13: Farmers in some regions may have already adjusted crop management practices
    to changing climatic conditions. Marginal impacts of increased rainfall in the
    dry season showed positive relations with net crop incomes. Policy planners need
    to reduce losses and take benefit of the gains by selecting and assessing the
    efficiency of existing adaptation mechanisms.
  14: The study suggests climate adaptation policy recommendations including strengthening
    research capacity for the development of new cultivars and farming techniques,
    enhancement of various enterprise diversification activities, making provision
    of crop insurance program and strengthening agricultural extension systems.

Quantitative material:
  2: "1 mm/month increase in rainfall and 10\xB0C increase in temperature will lead\
    \ to about US$4-15 increase in net crop income per hectare in Bangladesh; Future\
    \ impacts under climate change scenarios projected by Global Circulation Models\
    \ indicated an increase in net crop income from US$25-84 per hectare in the country."
  3: No relevant information
  5: Collected 46 years (1971-2016) climate data on monthly average temperature and
    monthly average rainfall from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department, Dhaka.
  8: "Mean net crop income is US$410.34/Ha with a standard deviation of US$249.95/Ha.\
    \ The paper uses a Ricardian model to estimate the marginal impacts of temperature\
    \ and rainfall changes on net crop income, expressed as: @ NR=@ T \xBC b 1 \xFE\
    \ 2 b 2 T and @ NR=@ R \xBC b 3 \xFE 2 b 4 R"
  9: Mean net crop income (US$/Ha) and standard deviation (SD) reported for seven
    climatic zones in Bangladesh. Adaptation strategies practiced by farmers are listed
    with the percentage of sample households using each strategy.
  10: Temperature and rainfall coefficients are provided for wet and dry seasons,
    influencing net crop income.
  11: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature during the wet season results in an income\
    \ gain of about US$15.64 per hectare. A 1\xB0C increase in temperature during\
    \ the dry season causes a decrease of net income by about US$0.22 per hectare.\
    \ A 1 mm/month increase in rainfall results in an increase in net incomes in both\
    \ the wet (US$0.30/Ha) and dry (US$3.94/Ha) seasons. Total impact of a 1\xB0C\
    \ increase in temperature and 1 mm/month increase in rainfall would cause an increase\
    \ in income by US$19.66 per hectare. Net crop income is more elastic to changes\
    \ in temperature (1.13 per cent) than rainfall (0.42 per cent)."
  12: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature leads to an increase in annual net incomes\
    \ between $11 to $48 (USD) per hectare in most climatic zones, but a decrease\
    \ of US$9.51-16.31 per hectare in colder climate zones such as south-eastern and\
    \ north-eastern Bangladesh. A 1 mm/month increase in rainfall leads to an increase\
    \ in net crop income between $1.56-$5.71."
  13: "Temperature increases of 1.81-2.04\xB0C by 2021-2060 and 3.68-4.47\xB0C by\
    \ 2061-2100. Rainfall changes: BNU-ESM projected decreasing rainfall (-4.8%) by\
    \ 2021-2060, increasing (5.47%) by 2061-2100; CanESM2 projected increasing rainfall\
    \ (3.39-19.97%) during both periods. Net income increases per hectare are greater\
    \ in 2061-2100 than 2021-2060 under both scenarios, specifically increases of\
    \ 24.77, 44.29, 60.82, 93.82 US$/Ha."
  14: Net crop income in Bangladesh would increase in the range of US$25-84 per hectare,
    with variations across climatic zones and climate models (BNU-ESM, CanESM2) and
    time periods (2021-2060, 2061-2100).
