Drivers of Risk:
  9: Climate change impacts on agricultural productivity; population growth; consumption
    demand; freshwater availability; land use; energy use.
Highlights:
  9: Maintaining per capita food production and reducing hunger/malnutrition is a
    major challenge; there are opportunities for yield growth through science; significant
    yield gains can be obtained by working with farmers and fishermen to deploy existing
    knowledge; the food system should be viewed in the broader context of freshwater,
    land, and energy competition and its connection to climate change mitigation and
    adaptation.
Methodology:
  9: The paper reviews published literature and synthesizes information.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
