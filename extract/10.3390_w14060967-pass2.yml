    across different continents and river basins with and without flood protection.
  17: Examines the relationship between business interruption (BI) loss and asset
    damage from floods across global river basins.
  18: The paper provides an overview of flood-related business interruption (BI) loss
    and asset damage, focusing on historical and future projections.
Highlights:
  1: "Future flood risk projection under RCP8.5 and SSP3 scenarios showed increases\
    \ in BI loss and asset damage per GDP by 0.32% and 1.78% (2061\u20132090 average)\
    \ compared with a past period (1971\u20132000 average), respectively."
  2: The study focuses on BI loss and compares its importance relative to asset damage.
    It aims to explore potential changes in flood risk impact under present and future
    scenarios.
  3: Application of bias-corrected atmospheric forcing improves the representation
    of river hydrodynamics simulations, including daily inundation depth and extent.
    The CaMa-Flood model, when implemented with this bias-corrected weather scheme,
    detected similar inter-annual and annual variations, as well as similar inundation
    extent and duration, between modeled discharge and in situ observations.
  7: BI loss is influenced by the inundation period, and a BI period constant derived
    from past flood cases is utilized; this constant is assumed to be two in this
    study.
  8: The paper estimates asset damage from floods using a damage-depth function and
    validates the method using the EM-DAT database and World Bank reports.
  9: CaMa-Flood was able to reproduce the general trend of global flood risk. Estimated
    BI losses calculated for Namibia, Moldova, Pakistan (2011), Thailand, and Malawi
    were similar to the World Bank values.
  11: America and Europe had greater absolute BI loss, but a smaller relative BI loss
    (% of GDP) than other regions. River basins with shallow slopes and long inundation
    periods had high BI loss as a percentage of GDP.
  12: Global annual BI loss and asset damage are projected to increase dramatically
    by 2061-2090 compared to 1971-2000.
  13: BI loss relative to GDP is projected to increase in some regions (e.g., Nile
    and Niger Rivers) and decrease in others (e.g., South America, Middle East, Australia).
  14: Previous asset damage-focused studies underestimated the economic impacts of
    floods, particularly in regions where the percentage of BI loss relative to asset
    damage was high.
  15: Flood protection significantly reduces both BI loss and asset damage from floods.
    In some areas, BI loss exceeded asset damage.
  16: Flood protection significantly reduces BI loss more than asset damage across
    continents; the effect is variable depending on the flood protection level (FPL)
    and location.
  17: BI loss to asset damage ratio is expected to increase in some major river basins
    despite existing flood protection, such as the Mississippi River.
  18: BI loss is projected to exceed 1.5% of local GDP in flat terrain regions, such
    as the Nile, Indonesia, and Chao Phraya River basins.
Methodology:
  1: Global river and inundation model driven by a bias-corrected meteorological forcing
    scheme.
  2: The study expands on the modeling framework established by Tanoue et al. [19]
    to include global river basins. The approach uses bias-corrected meteorological
    forcing data (S14FD) to simulate daily inundation depth and estimates BI loss
    based on simulated flood duration.
  3: Uses bias-corrected meteorological forcing data with the MATSIRO land surface
    model to generate daily runoff. The runoff is used in the CaMa-Flood inundation
    model to simulate daily total storage and depth. Inundation is determined when
    modeled daily total storage exceeds local flood protection standards. Downscaling
    transforms data to daily flood depth at a finer scale. BI loss is modeled using
    inundation period. Damage modeling uses annual maximum flood depth, landuse, damage-depth
    function, GDP, asset coefficient and GDP ratio of secondary and tertiary industry.
  4: Asset damage in urban areas is determined using land use data from the GLCNMO
    product, aggregated with the GRUMPv1 mask for national scale analysis.
  5: "Gridded GDP is derived according to the weighted distribution of country GDP\
    \ with respect to building height data. Building height data is derived from the\
    \ Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer global digital\
    \ elevation model at 30\u2033 \xD7 30\u2033 resolution. The relationship between\
    \ subnational GDP ratio and subnational building ratio is assumed to be linear."
  6: Derived the ratio of gridded GDP to country GDP from the ratio of gridded building
    height to total building height, using a correlation coefficient and a linear
    equation.
  7: The analysis calculates BI loss by comparing secondary and tertiary industry
    production during non-flood and flood periods, using factors like inundation periods
    and GDP data.
  8: "Asset damage is calculated through the multiplication of asset value (based\
    \ on GDP and an asset coefficient) by the fraction of assets with flood-related\
    \ damage. The damage fraction is derived using a damage\u2013depth function from\
    \ Huizinga et al. [46], and they use annual maximum inundation depth to calculate\
    \ asset damage."
  9: "The study uses a reanalysis simulation (S14FD-Reanalysis forcing dataset and\
    \ past GDP data for 1960\u20132013) and a GCM simulation (historical S14FD-GCM\
    \ (1961\u20132005) dataset and GDP data to estimate past flood impacts; future\
    \ S14FD-GCM dataset for Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) (2006\u2013\
    2098) and GDP data for Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 3 (SSP3) to estimate future\
    \ flood impacts)."
  11: Projected future BI loss and asset damage using bias-corrected S14FD-GCM forcing
    data, S14FD-Reanalysis data, and output from CaMa-Flood driven by S14FD-GCM. Averaged
    values produced by five GCMs.
  12: "Comparison of historical GCM simulation (1961\u20132005) against reanalysis\
    \ simulation to validate GCM results. Estimation of future BI loss and asset damage\
    \ for near-term (2021\u20132050) and long-term (2061\u20132090) and comparison\
    \ with the past period (1971\u20132000)."
  14: BI loss is defined as loss related to business interruption caused only by floods,
    not including indirect losses.
  15: Reanalysis simulation with and without flood protection from 1960 to 2013. BI
    loss and asset damage were derived from annual average reanalysis simulation values.
  16: Analysis involves comparing BI loss to asset damage ratios in river basins with
    different levels of flood protection and calculating flood occurrence based on
    annual maximum inundation depth.
  17: Uses simulations to estimate future BI loss and asset damage ratios relative
    to flood protection levels across river basins.
  18: The analysis estimates historical and future flood-related BI loss and asset
    damage globally, using flood return periods and scenarios RCP8.5 and SSP3.
More Notes:
  2: The study does not estimate high-order propagation effects.
  5: The authors used data from 11 countries to obtain the relationship between building
    height and gridded GDP and applied it globally. Subnational GDP data was obtained
    from government or public institutions of each country.
  7: The selection of the BI period constant is acknowledged as a simplistic assumption,
    suggesting it should be updated with more data.
  8: The validation dataset includes specific flood events and their corresponding
    losses in USD 2005 PPP, categorized by country, year, targeted industry, and characteristics
    of the flood.
  9: The paper describes a method for estimating BI loss and asset damage with flood
    protection. Losses are expressed in USD (2005 PPP) after converting from nominal
    GDP in local currency.
  12: BI loss and asset damage are expressed in 2005 PPP (Purchasing Power Parity)
    USD.
  14: The study's BI loss estimates are smaller than World Bank estimates because
    the study excludes indirect losses.
  15: The effect of flood protection on BI loss appears greater than its effect on
    reducing asset damage.
