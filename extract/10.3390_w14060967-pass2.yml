Drivers of Risk:
  1: Flood risk increases due to global warming and socioeconomic changes, impacting
    flood-related economic losses.
  2: Flood hazard (inundation depth and duration) driven by river flooding. Meteorological
    forcing data and climate change (warmer climate leading to increased flood frequency).
  3: Inundation period and inundation depth
  5: The paper implicitly considers flood risk as a driver impacting GDP.
  7: Inundation period due to flooding.
  9: Floods caused by heavy rainfall.
  10: "River basin drainage area (\u226510,000 km2)."
  11: Prolonged inundation periods in river basins with shallow slopes.
  12: Climate change, specifically increases in flood events as simulated by Global
    Climate Models (GCMs).
  13: Flooding causing business interruption and asset damage.
  14: Shocks impacting outcomes include floods and related indirect losses, exemplified
    by severe floods in Nigeria affecting productivity in commercial sectors.
  15: Flooding, flood protection (or lack thereof).
  16: Floods (specifically, the number of years where inundation depth exceeds flood
    protection levels) are a key driver. Lack of flood protection increases the ratio
    of BI loss to asset damage.
  17: Flood protection levels (FPL) and the frequency of floods in river basins impact
    the business interruption (BI) loss to asset damage ratio.
  18: Flooding; Climate change (RCP8.5 and SSP3 scenarios)
Highlights:
  1: "Future flood risk projections indicate increases in BI loss and asset damage\
    \ per GDP by 0.32% and 1.78% (2061\u20132090 average) compared with the past period\
    \ (1971\u20132000 average)."
  2: BI loss can be as extensive as asset damage and should be included in global-scale
    flood risk assessments. Previous studies primarily focused on asset damage.
  3: "Estimation of BI loss and asset damage based on inundation period and depth\
    \ data, using bias-corrected meteorological forcing data, at a high resolution\
    \ (30\u2033 \xD7 30\u2033)."
  7: "The paper estimates BI loss as a consequence of flooding, linking it to inundation\
    \ period and production in secondary and tertiary industries.  The study simplifies\
    \ the estimation of the constant (\u03B1) used to estimate business interruption\
    \ period based on an analysis of past flood events from Japan, USA and Thailand."
  9: CaMa-Flood was able to reproduce the general trend of global flood risk. Estimated
    BI losses calculated for Namibia, Moldova, Pakistan (2011), Thailand, and Malawi
    were similar to the World Bank values.
  10: The method of calculating asset damage was sufficiently accurate for global
    long-term averages.
  11: America and Europe have high absolute BI loss but lower BI loss as a percentage
    of GDP compared to global average due to higher GDP.
  12: Significant increases in flood-related BI loss and asset damage, both in absolute
    terms and relative to GDP, are projected due to climate change.
  13: Severe BI losses projected in China, Thailand, and Nile River; increases in
    losses and as GDP percentage in several regions.
  14: The study finds BI losses often underestimated when compared to asset damage,
    with significant BI loss observed in African and European regions.
  15: Flood protection significantly reduces both BI loss and asset damage, with BI
    loss experiencing a greater reduction than asset damage.
  16: Flood protection has a greater effect on BI loss than on asset damage. Higher
    flood protection levels (FPL) lead to a significant decrease in both the number
    of floods and the ratio of BI loss to asset damage. The effectiveness of flood
    protection varies depending on the specific context (e.g., FPL relative to inundation
    depth).
  17: BI loss to asset damage ratio is projected to increase in most parts of China,
    India, central Africa, Europe, and America, despite high FPL.
  18: "BI loss is not negligible in the estimation of global flood risk; the projected\
    \ risk changes with local FPL and flood magnitude; Future flood risk projection\
    \ using the same framework under RCP8.5 and SSP3 scenarios showed increases in\
    \ BI loss and asset damage per GDP by 0.32% and 1.78% (2061\u20132090 average),\
    \ compared with values from the past interval (1971\u20132000 average)."
Methodology:
  1: The study uses a global river and inundation model driven by a bias-corrected
    meteorological forcing scheme to estimate BI loss and asset damage.
  2: Uses a modeling framework established by Tanoue et al. [19] to estimate global
    flood-related asset damage and BI loss for present and future scenarios. Leverages
    bias-corrected meteorological forcing data (S14FD) to simulate daily inundation
    depth.
  3: Uses bias-corrected meteorological forcing data; Land Surface Model (MATSIRO);
    Inundation Model (CaMa-Flood); Land Use and Damage-depth Function; GDP and Asset
    Modeling; BI loss modeling
  5: The paper calculates gridded GDP based on the weighted distribution of country
    GDP with respect to building height data at a finer resolution. The relationship
    between building height and gridded GDP is developed using subnational GDP data
    from 11 countries. This relationship is assumed to be linear.
  7: "BI loss is estimated based on gridded GDP, the GDP ratio of secondary and tertiary\
    \ industries, and the inundation period. The BI period is assumed to be proportional\
    \ to the inundation period.  Inundation period and annual maximum inundation depth\
    \ is calculated from daily water storage at 0.25\xB0 \xD7 0.25\xB0 resolution\
    \ using the FLOPROS dataset and a high-resolution digital elevation model, downscaled\
    \ to a horizontal resolution of 30\u2033 \xD7 30\u2033.  Calculation is done only\
    \ when calculated daily total storage exceeds the total storage, which is equivalent\
    \ to the current flood protection standard."
  9: Reanalysis simulation using S14FD-Reanalysis forcing dataset and past GDP data
    (1960-2013). GCM simulation using historical S14FD-GCM (1961-2005) and future
    S14FD-GCM dataset for RCP8.5 (2006-2098) and GDP data for SSP3 to estimate past
    and future flood impacts.
  10: Asset damage estimation methodology validated against previous studies by comparing
    calculated global asset damage with values obtained from those studies. Spatial
    distribution of annual BI loss and BI loss per GDP are shown according to river
    basin drainage area.
  11: Analysis using bias-corrected S14FD-GCM forcing data and output from CaMa-Flood
    driven by S14FD-GCM, with average values from five GCMs.
  12: Future BI loss and asset damage are estimated for near-term (2021-2050) and
    long-term (2061-2090) periods and compared with estimates for the past period
    (1971-2000).
  13: "GCM simulation results comparing past (1971\u20132000) and future (2061\u2013\
    2090) BI losses."
  14: BI losses are estimated using reanalysis simulation results for historical flood
    events from 1960 to 2013.
  15: Reanalysis simulation with and without flood protection, averaged from 1960-2013.
  16: Uses annual averaged reanalysis simulation values to derive data for the ratio
    of BI loss to asset damage. Targets four river basins with similar ratios of BI
    loss to asset damage without flood protection to analyze the impact of flood protection
    levels.
  18: A method was developed to estimate flooding-related BI loss on a global scale;
    Future flood risk projection using the same framework under RCP8.5 and SSP3 scenarios
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on BI loss and compares its importance relative to asset damage.
    It does not estimate high-order propagation effects.
  3: The study uses a gridded GDP dataset. It defines inundation occurrence based
    on exceeding local flood protection standards.
  5: The study uses National GDP data, World Bank Open Data, and building height data
    from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer global
    digital elevation model.
  7: "The authors acknowledge that the constant used to estimate the BI period (\u03B1\
    =2) is a simplistic assumption and recommend it be revised when more data becomes\
    \ available. They assume no daily production occurs during inundation periods."
  9: Losses from EM-DAT or World Bank are converted to USD (2005 PPP) using nominal
    GDP ratios due to missing data.
  10: The data covers the period from 1960 to 2013.
  12: Maximum deviations from the average BI loss and asset damage among all GCMs
    were 137.9% and 101.2%, respectively.
  15: In Malawi in 2012, the BI loss estimates with and without flood protection were
    USD 0.35 and 138 million (2005 PPP), respectively. However, this information may
    be drawn from sources other than the current article.
  16: The paper focuses on the impact of flood protection on the ratio of BI loss
    to asset damage, suggesting that BI is more sensitive to flood protection measures
    than direct asset damage. It doesn't directly quantify macroeconomic impacts,
    but it suggests a mechanism through which floods and flood protection can influence
    economic activity.
  18: The estimation values in this study might remain the scope of first order estimation
    due to the uncertainties of model, dataset, and methods; River basins with mild
    slopes such as the Amazon have long inundation periods and greater BI loss; The
    BI loss to asset damage ratio is projected to increase in river basins with high
    FPL presumably because of the increase in the number of floods with large return
    periods.

  5: "s_GDPratio = 0.9634 \xD7 s_bldratio + 0.0011.  This equation estimates the relationship\
    \ between the ratio of subnational GDP to country GDP (s_GDPratio) and the total\
    \ building height within each subnational region to the total building height\
    \ within the country (s_bldratio)."
  7: "BI loss is calculated using the formula: BI loss = (IP + BIP/2) / Nd * AP, where\
    \ IP is the inundation period, BIP is the BI period, AP is the annual production\
    \ of secondary and tertiary industries, and Nd is the number of days per year.\
    \  BIP = IP * \u03B1, where \u03B1 is a proportional constant set to 2 in this\
    \ study."
