Drivers of Risk:
  2: Continued emissions of greenhouse gases; changes in temperature, precipitation
    patterns, and CO2 concentrations; extreme weather events (cyclones, floods, hailstorms,
    droughts); increased climate variability.
  3: Climate change impacts such as temperature increases, extreme rainfall, and flooding
    affecting food safety and availability.
  4: Climate change, socio-economic development paths, absence of CO2 fertilization
    effects on crops.
  5: Socio-economic development paths, climate change (specifically, changes in mean
    climate and extreme events), population growth, competition between food production
    and bio-energy, and uncertainties related to General Circulation Model (GCM) projections.
  6: 'Climate change will affect all four dimensions of food security: food availability,
    access to food, stability of food supplies, and food utilization.'
Highlights:
  2: Net decline of 110 million ha in cropland, massive decline in agricultural prime
    land offset by increase in moderately suitable land.
  3: Climate change impacts are likely to have small effects on global agricultural
    GDP, but significant for regions like sub-Saharan Africa, which is expected to
    experience a substantial decline in this GDP sector.
  4: Climate change is likely to increase the number of people at risk of hunger compared
    with reference scenarios with no climate change. The exact impacts strongly depend
    on projected socio-economic developments.
  5: Socio-economic development has a more significant impact on future food security
    than climate change. Sub-Saharan Africa is likely to become the most food-insecure
    region, largely independent of climate change, but dependent on socio-economic
    pathways.
  6: The socio-economic environment is more important than the biophysical changes
    of climate change in determining impacts.
Methodology:
  2: Based on FAO/International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) agro-ecological
    zone (AEZ) methodology to estimate changes in land suitability, potential yields,
    and agricultural production on current crops and cultivars.
  3: Agro-ecologic and economic models are coupled to gauge the impact of climate
    change on agricultural GDP and prices.
  4: Uses AEZ and DSSAT crop modeling systems coupled to the BLS economic model to
    project the number of people at risk of hunger under different SRES scenarios
    with and without climate change and CO2 fertilization effects. Models are calibrated
    to 824 million undernourished people in 2000.
  5: Relies on the FAO/IIASA AEZ model and IIASA BLS system, combined with various
    GCM models. Analysis is based on IPCC SRES scenarios, which are not probability-based
    forecasts. The models primarily focus on food availability and access, with limitations
    in quantifying food safety and stability impacts.
  6: The quantitative assessments review impact on the four dimensions of food security
    over time, considering socio-economic status of countries.
More Notes:
  2: The study implicitly includes adaptation using available management techniques
    and crops, but excluding new cultivars.
  3: No other relevant notes.
  5: The existing global assessments largely focus on the impacts on food availability
    and access, without quantification of the likely important climate change effects
    on food safety and vulnerability (stability). The robustness of the assessments
    strongly depends on the performance of the underlying models developed at IIASA.
  6: The first decades of the 21st century are expected to see lower impacts of climate
    change but also lower overall incomes and still a higher dependence on agriculture;
    the second half of the century is expected to bring more severe biophysical impacts
    but also a greater ability to cope with them.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Impacts on agriculture and food supply (crop yields, land suitability, food security),
    with associated economic consequences.
  4: Number of people at risk of hunger in developing countries.
  5: Focuses on food security and hunger as key outcomes, with indirect implications
    for macroeconomic stability (though these aren't explicitly quantified).
  6: Climate change will adversely affect food security.
Outcomes of Interest:
  3: Impact of climate change on agricultural GDP and food security in various regions.
Quantitative material:
  2: Total land and total prime land would remain virtually unchanged at current levels
    of 2,600 million and 2,000 million hectares, respectively.
  3: Estimates of changes in agricultural GDP due to climate change, ranging from
    a decline of 2% to an increase of 12.6% by 2080 at a global level.
  4: Table 1 presents the number of people at risk of hunger in developing countries
    (in millions) for years 2020, 2050, and 2080, under different SRES scenarios (A1,
    A2, B1, B2) with and without climate change (CC) and CO2 fertilization effects,
    using AEZ and DSSAT crop modeling systems coupled with the BLS economic model.
  5: Estimates reductions of 110 million to 700 million undernourished people by 2080
    under scenarios A1, B1, and B2 compared to FAO estimates; exception is scenario
    A2.
  6: All quantitative assessments reviewed show that climate change will affect all
    four dimensions of food security.
