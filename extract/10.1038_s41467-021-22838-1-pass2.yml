Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea level rise caused by anthropogenic climate change.
  2: Anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR) and cyclonic coastal storms.
  3: Global mean temperature (GMST) changes influenced by historical and natural forcings.
  4: The primary driver of risk is anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR) impacting coastal
    flooding.
  5: Anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR) causing increased flood extent and depth.
  6: Sea level rise associated with anthropogenic climate change, coastal water levels,
    and flooding
  7: ASLR (accelerated sea-level rise), Storm Surge, Floods, Water Depth
  8: Storms, Hurricane Sandy, sea-level rise.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Economic damages and flood area extension affecting additional people.
  2: Hurricane Sandy damages in New York City and the Atlantic coast of New Jersey.
  3: Sea level rise (GMSL) from 1900 to 2012 and its attributable anthropogenic component
    (ASLR).
  4: This study evaluates damages (in $Million) from sea level rise in Manhattan and
    surrounding areas. The study also examines the portion of Sandy damages attributable
    to climate-mediated anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR).
  5: Property damage, population exposure, and housing unit exposure.
  6: Economic damages of Hurricane Sandy and other coastal storms
  7: Property damage is calculated using the standard HAZUS-MH method.
  8: Damage assessment was performed.
Highlights:
  1: Approximately $8.1B of Hurricane Sandy's damages and flood area expansion affecting
    71,000 additional people are attributable to anthropogenic sea level rise.
  2: Human-caused sea level rise has contributed to damages associated with past coastal
    floods and will increasingly aggravate damages in the future.
  3: Anthropogenic climate change has contributed significantly to sea level rise
    between 1900 and 2012.
  4: A significant portion of the damages from Hurricane Sandy in the New York tri-state
    area is attributable to climate-mediated anthropogenic sea level rise.
  5: Anthropogenic sea level rise significantly increases exposure and damage in the
    tri-state area, with specific percentage increases quantified for population,
    housing, and property damage.
  6: Applying the relationship found between global and New York ASLR in the budget
    approach to downscale our semi-empirical results reduces independence between
    approaches to a small degree; Estimates of damages associated with ASLR would
    be biased low, but this effect should be small, as our study concerns the difference
    between two very similar floods.
  7: Provides block-level differences in modeled damages for three increments, each
    vs. actual sea level. The areas with flood damages during Sandy had hobs from
    2.5 to 4.2 m, and raw model results have a bias of -1.2 cm and root mean square
    error (RMSE) of 35.5 cm. After spatial bias correction, the mean bias is reduced
    to -0.1 cm and RMSE is 22.3 cm.
Methodology:
  1: Simulated water levels and damage as they occurred and as they would have occurred
    across a range of lower sea levels corresponding to different estimates of attributable
    sea level rise.
  2: The study uses a high-resolution dynamic flood model, spatially varying error
    correction, and estimates of ASLR to simulate Hurricane Sandy's peak flood under
    actual and counterfactual conditions. They construct a global mean sea-level-rise
    budget based on contributions from land-ice melt, ocean thermal expansion, and
    land-water-storage changes. They also develop semi-empirical estimates using a
    function of global mean temperature. Analysis is applicable to past coastal floods.
  3: Semi-empirical modeling based on global temperature timeseries (HadCRUT4 and
    CMIP5), counterfactual scenarios (stable and cooling temperatures), and natural-forcing-only
    CMIP5 experiments. The differences between historical and counterfactual scenarios
    were used to estimate anthropogenic contributions. Ensemble results were developed
    by pooling simulations from stable, cooling, and CMIP5 approaches.
  4: The study uses hydrodynamic modeling and spatial bias correction to simulate
    Sandy's flood under actual and counterfactual sea levels. They estimate fractions
    of damages attributable to ASLR and apply these to total state-reported costs.
    Different ASLR estimates are used to develop a range of damage estimates.
  5: Total ensemble ASLR estimates are used with hydrodynamic simulation, spatial
    bias correction, and flood-depth-based assessment of property damage. The global
    ASLR estimates are divided into two fully independent sets based on sea-level-budget
    reconstruction and semi-empirical modeling.
  6: Builds budgets of global mean and climate-linked New York sea level rise from
    literature-derived estimates of each contributing component during the study period;
    Uses a semi-empirical sea level model that relates the rate of global mean sea-level
    change to global mean temperature.
  7: Hydrodynamic flood simulations are performed using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
    Coastal Storm Modeling System (CSTORM-MS). Damage is calculated using HAZUS-MH
    method, based on depth-damage curves and maximum damages differentiated for 33
    building types per census block.  A spatially coherent bias correction is utilized
    to correct model error.  Attributable damages are estimated from state-reported
    costs and fraction of damages attributable to ASLR.
  8: Damage assessment was performed using HAZUS-MH software version MR4; standard
    GIS software was used.
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on the influence of climate-linked sea level rise alone, excluding
    other possible climate warming effects.
  5: The study uses both budget-based and semi-empirical models for ASLR estimation
    and compares them against observations. The study notes that there is potential
    mismatch between observed and modeled results. The marginal contributions to flood
    extent and depth are visualized for different amounts of ASLR. The ensemble approach
    is noted as a reasonable and robust characterization of ASLR.
  6: 'The study considers three attribution scenarios: high, central, and low, based
    on literature estimates of attributable fractions for different components of
    sea level rise; Includes potential ASLR predating 1900, which was neglected in
    the main analysis, and estimates that this would increase overall estimates slightly
    further.'
  7: The study focuses on estimating relative damages among simulated floods starting
    from slightly different baseline sea levels.
