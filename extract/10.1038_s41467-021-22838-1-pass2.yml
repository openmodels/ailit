Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea level rise driven by anthropogenic climate change
  2: Climate-mediated human contribution to sea level rise (ASLR) driven by anthropogenic
    warming.
  4: Anthropogenic sea-level rise is identified as a driver impacting damages in the
    New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut tri-state area during Hurricane Sandy.
  5: Anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR) is the primary driver of increased flood
    risk and associated damages.
  6: Anthropogenic sea level rise due to climate change, influenced by factors such
    as ice-sheet mass loss, glacier melt, thermal expansion, and regional ocean dynamics.
Highlights:
  1: Climate-mediated anthropogenic sea level rise contributed significantly to the
    economic damages of Hurricane Sandy
  2: Human-caused sea level rise has contributed to damages associated with past coastal
    floods and will increasingly aggravate damages in the future as sea levels continue
    to rise.
  4: "The estimated damages for New York City alone, attributable to total ensemble\
    \ ASLR, were $1.5 billion ($0.9B\u2013$2.5B)."
  5: "ASLR is estimated to expose an additional 71 (40\u2013131) thousand more people\
    \ and 36 (21\u201366) thousand more housing units in the Tri-State area, representing\
    \ 9.2% (5.3\u201317%) and 8.8% (5.0\u201316%) increases, respectively."
  6: Sea-level rise is strongly linked to climate change, supporting event and impact
    attribution of storm damages.
Methodology:
  1: Simulate water levels and damage both as they occurred and as they would have
    occurred across a range of lower sea levels corresponding to different estimates
    of attributable sea level rise
  2: High-resolution dynamic flood model and spatially varying error correction to
    simulate Sandy's peak flood under actual and counterfactual conditions with lower
    baseline sea levels. Multi-method estimates for global and New York-area ASLR
    through 2012 are developed.
  4: The study uses hydrodynamic modeling, spatial bias correction, and damage modeling
    to estimate the damages attributable to ASLR during Hurricane Sandy.
  5: The analysis uses total ensemble ASLR estimates, hydrodynamic simulation, spatial
    correction, and flood-depth-based assessment of property damage to quantify the
    impact of ASLR.
  6: Sea-level rise attribution using both sea level budgets and semi-empirical models,
    including global climate model simulations and temperature-based scenarios.
More Notes:
  1: The approach can be applied to impact assessments for other past and future coastal
    storms
  2: The study focuses on the influence of linked sea level rise alone, excluding
    other possible effects of climate warming on storm track and intensity. The study
    quantifies a lower bound for the effect of anthropogenic climate change.
  5: The study acknowledges potential biases in the estimates, such as the inclusion
    of land subsidence effects in observed sea level rise and potential omission of
    other climate-linked local sea-level rise.
  6: Models account for sea-level contributions from glaciers and ice sheets, and
    for regional ocean dynamics, despite potential slight mismatches between observed
    and modeled changes.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic damage due to flooding
  2: Dollars of damage from Hurricane Sandy attributable to climate-mediated anthropogenic
    sea level rise (ASLR).
  5: Property damage (in $ Billions), population exposed (thousands), and housing
    units exposed (thousands) are used as measures of economic costs associated with
    sea level rise.
  6: Total economic damages linked to anthropogenic sea level rise (ASLR) during coastal
    storms like Hurricane Sandy.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Extension of the flood area to affect 71 (40\u2013131) thousand additional people"
  2: Climate-mediated ASLR drove multi-billions of dollars of damage from Hurricane
    Sandy.
  4: "ASLR (anthropogenic sea-level rise) accounts for 13% of Sandy damages in the\
    \ tri-state area, translating to $8.1 billion ($4.7B\u2013$14B) in climate-mediated\
    \ damages."
  5: "The paper provides quantitative estimates of the percentage increase in damage,\
    \ population exposed, and housing units exposed in the Tri-State Area, New York\
    \ City, New Jersey, and Connecticut due to ASLR, along with absolute numbers (e.g.,\
    \ 71 (40\u2013131) thousand more people exposed in the tri-state area)."
  6: Estimates of ASLR in New York are provided, with stated minimum values of sea
    level rise for New York and NE America before Hurricane Sandy.
