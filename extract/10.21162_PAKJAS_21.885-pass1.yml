Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increasing temperature, heavy rainfall, and CO2 levels.
  3: Climate change variables (average temperature, average rainfall, CO2), government
    subsidy, economic constraint, individual household social-economic status, education,
    cultivated area under cotton crop, agriculture labor force for cotton, electricity
    consumption, infrastructural changes, fertilizer consumption for the cotton crop,
    seed consumption for cotton crop
  6: Climate variables such as average temperature change, average rainfall, and CO2
    levels are impacting productivity.
  7: Climate change (temperature, CO2), non-climate change factors
Drivers_of_Risk:
  4: The study examines the impact of average temperature, rainfall, CO2 emissions,
    infrastructure, labor, and other variables on productivity.
Highlights:
  1: Increases in temperature and rainfall positively affect cotton productivity,
    while CO2 harms it. Infrastructural changes positively affect productivity, while
    labor is negatively related.
  3: The study comprehensively analyzes maximum variables to assess the effect of
    climate change on cotton productivity in Pakistan.
  4: The results indicate all selected variables are non-stationary at level except
    productivity and infrastructure, highlighting the need for ARDL bound testing.
  6: Average temperature change and average rainfall positively affect productivity,
    while CO2 has a significant negative relation.
Methodology:
  1: Autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) was employed on time series data
    from 1970 to 2018.
  3: Stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) approach to decompose total factor productivity
    and measure technical efficiency; ARDL bounds testing model approach to examine
    the long-run co-integration relationship.
  4: The analysis uses time series data with unit root tests and ARDL bound testing
    to explore stationarity and long-run and short-run relationships between productivity
    and selected variables.
  6: The study uses an ARDL (Autoregressive Distributed Lag) error correction model
    to analyze the impact on productivity, with results applicable for the period
    studied (1990-2015).
  7: Investigating impact of CO2, climate, and non-climate change factors on cotton
    productivity using primary data at the district level.
More Notes:
  1: The model can be generalized to all the developing countries. Agriculture sector
    contributes 18.9% to the national GDP, and approximately 42.3% labor force is
    employed in this sector.
  3: The study uses time-series data from 1971-2018, but is restricted by data availability.
  7: The paper recommends that the government should focus on R&D to introduce new
    cotton varieties tolerant to high temperatures.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Cotton productivity is affected by climate change, CO2 levels, and infrastructural
    changes.
  3: Cotton total factor productivity (TFP)
  6: The study investigates the effect of climate variables like average temperature,
    rainfall, and CO2 on productivity in Pakistan, specifically in cotton production.
  7: Cotton productivity
Outcomes_of_Interest:
  4: Productivity is analyzed in relation to various factors, indicating a focus on
    productivity loss or gains.
Quantitative material:
  1: Increases in temperature and rainfall positively affected cotton productivity,
    while CO2 harms cotton productivity.
  3: Time-series data from 1971 to 2018 is used to estimate the total factor productivity
    of cotton, includes a graph showing the trend of cotton total factor productivity
    from 1971 to 2017.
  6: Specific coefficient values are provided for variables affecting cotton productivity;
    e.g., CO2 has a long-run negative coefficient of -0.59310 on productivity.
Quantitative_material:
  4: The descriptive statistics provide quantitative values for productivity and other
    variables, such as mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation.
