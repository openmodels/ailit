Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global climate change
  3: Extreme weather events such as heat waves, heavy precipitation, tropical cyclones,
    storm surges, droughts, and dry spells are impacting food systems.
  11: Climate change impacts on mycotoxins, longer-term temperatures, new plant fungal
    diseases, rising incidence of disease, increasing climate variability and longer-term
    trends in climate, increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events.
  13: Climate change impacts on agriculture (reduced consumption due to higher food
    prices, reduced income generation, reduced adaptive capacity).
  14: Increasing climate variability, weak access to public services and humanitarian
    assistance, isolation from market signals, rising food prices, decreases in food
    quality, safety, and availability at the local level.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change will affect agricultural yields and earnings, food prices, reliability
    of delivery, food quality, and food safety.
  3: The need to focus on managing short-term climate risks rather than just long-term
    changes in mean values remains crucial.
  11: Climate change can impact volume, quality, safety, and delivery of food in the
    postproduction stages of the food chain via amplifications of climate change impacts
    on agricultural production.
  13: Climate change disproportionately impacts the poor, increasing inequality over
    time.
  14: Climate change is expected to increase child malnutrition by 20% by 2050.
Methodology:
  1: Historical statistical studies and integrated assessment models.
  11: Models of future yield changes, integrated economic models (e.g., Mideksa (90)
    for Ethiopia, Hassan (91) for Africa).
More Notes:
  1: Low-income producers and consumers will be more vulnerable due to limited ability
    to invest in adaptive institutions and technologies.
  3: Food systems are highly interconnected and impacted by climate-related changes
    and governance issues.
  11: This page primarily focuses on the impact of climate change on agricultural
    systems and food security, with specific attention to mycotoxins and post-production
    activities.
  13: Vulnerability to climate change (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity)
    is not evenly distributed.
No relevant information:
  8: No relevant information
  19: This page does not contain material directly relevant to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    risks of climate change, or costs/benefits of adaptation at the national level.
    It primarily discusses agricultural mitigation strategies and their trade-offs.
  33: This page primarily contains a table of contents and does not directly address
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks of climate change, or costs/benefits of adaptation
    at a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Agricultural yields and earnings, food prices, reliability of delivery, food
    quality, and food safety.
  11: Impacts on agricultural economies and food systems, problems of increasing inequality
    and lack of reinvestment in agricultural development.
  13: Poverty reduction rate will slow, but not reverse globally due to climate change.
  14: Climate change impacts affordability, especially for poor urban consumers, though
    their vulnerability is generally lower than rural consumers; Direct impacts on
    human health and well-being due to rising food prices and associated social unrest;
    Unchecked climate change will result in a 20% increase in child malnutrition by
    2050, particularly in Africa and Asia.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Food systems contribute 19%\u201329% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas\
    \ (GHG) emissions, releasing 9,800\u201316,900 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent\
    \ (MtCO2e) in 2008. Agricultural production contributes 80%\u201386% of total\
    \ food system emissions."
  14: Estimate that unchecked climate change will result in a 20% increase in child
    malnutrition by 2050.
