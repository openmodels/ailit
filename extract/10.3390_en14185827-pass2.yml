  8: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: No relevant information
  2: Climate change impacting hydropower generation.
  7: Reliance on coal-fired power plants; Water scarcity impacting power plant operations.
  8: Climate change is considered as a vulnerability for Zimbabwe's energy sector,
    but not directly modelled on this page.
  10: Climate change causing drought, impacting water availability for power generation
    (hydropower and coal), biomass growth for cooking, and overall agricultural output.
    Dependence on regional power pool makes Zimbabwe vulnerable to water shortages
    in neighboring countries.
  11: Projected long-term droughts leading to decreased hydropower generation and
    increased reliance on coal-based generation or imports, risking economic damage
    and missing NDC targets.
  12: Climate change impacts (drying climate/water shortages impacting hydropower),
    over-dependence on hydropower, inaction, emissions from fossil fuels
  13: The graphs likely suggest changes in energy strategies as drivers, such as coal
    vs. clean energy adaptation, impacting outcomes.
  14: The analysis considers the impact of different energy adaptation strategies
    (coal vs. clean) on direct costs and emissions. Climatic change leads to limited
    supplies from hydropower.
  16: Risk arises from climate change future, specific to coal-based reinforcement
    leading to loss of emissions gains.
  17: Lack of aggressive action on Zimbabwe's NDCs
  18: Infrastructure and objectives at risk due to climate futures and other development
    uncertainties.
  19: Upstream water diversion and pumping for agriculture can reduce hydropower generation
    while increasing electricity demand for pumping, creating reinforcing vulnerabilities.
    Ineffective or limited clean adaptation policies and measures (PAMs).
  21: Anticipated hydropower capacity factors are provided but assumed to be *without*
    climate change.
Highlights:
  1: No relevant information
  2: NDCs that focus on mitigation should include resilience in their design, otherwise
    they can introduce deep vulnerability.
  7: The System Development Plan (SDP) has a Net Present Value (NPV) of $6.541 billion
    USD. The SDP is being updated to SDP+ to account for project delays.
  8: The SDP+ scenario results in deep emissions reductions. Increased energy efficiency
    leads to a future scenario with significant potential.
  10: Zimbabwe's economy is vulnerable to climate change due to its reliance on water-dependent
    power generation and biomass for cooking. Climate change threatens the achievement
    of NDCs. Droughts lead to power cuts, food shortages, and economic disruption.
    The NDC infrastructure itself is vulnerable to future climate conditions.
  11: The analysis suggests three options for responding to climate risks, with the
    clean adaptation scenario offering economic benefits and low emissions if aggressively
    pursued.
  12: Inaction results in high economic damage; poorly planned NDC investments can
    lead to economic calamity. Coal reinforcement avoids economic damage but significantly
    increases emissions. Clean adaptation, balancing renewables, energy efficiency,
    and hydropower, can lower emissions and have lower fuel costs, but requires significant
    institutional and market changes.
  13: Key highlights include contrasting trends for coal and clean energy adaptation
    strategies, with clean energy showing fluctuating but generally increasing trends.
  14: Clean adaptation results in significantly lower emissions than coal adaptation
    and the 'no adaptation' scenario. Clean adaptation requires significant investments
    in renewable energy technologies due to their relatively low capacity factors.
    Coal adaptation requires comparable energy generation quantities to clean adaptation
    which uses renewables and displaced energy from efficiency measures.
  16: Climate proofing NDCs and exceeding mitigation targets is feasible and potentially
    economically beneficial.
  17: "Without aggressive action, Zimbabwe\u2019s NDC gains may be lost at high economic\
    \ and environmental costs."
  18: Integration of analyses in the electricity sector allows for cost harmonization
    and capturing co-benefits of off-grid electrification and reduced emissions.
  19: Harmonization between hydropower planning and water and agriculture policy is
    crucial. Developing a balancing market to absorb electricity from intermittent
    sources is recommended. A special reserve fund should be developed to allow for
    the stockpiling of coal when it is not needed. Energy efficiency and demand-side
    measures are growing in importance.
Methodology:
  1: No relevant information
  2: Uses the Open-Source energy Modelling SYStem (OSeMOSYS) to consider two adaptation
    pathways.
  5: The analysis is performed using the Open-Source energy Modelling SYStem (OSeMOSYS),
    which is a bottom-up, technology-rich, linear programming energy systems model.
  8: 'Scenario modeling is used to analyze the electricity system under different
    futures: a fossil fuel future, an updated System Development Plan (SDP+), and
    a scenario meeting Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC). The NDC scenario
    is created by reducing energy demand by 5% compared to the SDP+ scenario.'
  10: The paper uses three climate futures from the World Bank's ECRAI study, specifically
    selected to represent relatively dry scenarios. These scenarios are based on downscaled
    rainfall data to calculate projected runoff in the Zambezi basin. Hydropower production
    data from a water systems model is fed into an energy systems model of Zimbabwe
    to estimate an electric energy price trajectory.
  12: The analysis considers different climate futures (GISS-E2-H) and scenarios (NDC
    investments, coal reinforcement, clean adaptation). Results are shown for electricity
    production, emissions, and economic damage. Timeframe is 2020-2050/2060.
  13: The analysis involves projecting different energy adaptation scenarios (NDC1
    coal vs. clean) over 2020-2050, but specific methodologies are not detailed.
  14: The analysis compares direct costs and emissions under different energy adaptation
    scenarios (NDC 'no adaptation', coal adaptation, and clean adaptation) from 2020
    to 2050. It models energy generation and consumption under each scenario.
  16: Analysis is a proof-of-concept with limitations such as limited climate runs
    and scenario calibrations.
  17: The model assumes a perfect market is adopted to new renewables and hydropower
    investment; this is not realistic.
  18: Systematic planning approach accounting for uncertainty using a large ensemble
    of potential climate futures.
  19: The paper outlines a clean adaptation strategy including changes to the regulatory
    framework and market rules that govern the power sector and coal-purchases, as
    well as energy efficiency markets. Recommends developing a pathway and milestone
    approach. Analysis extended from Zimbabwe to assess the Southern African region.
  21: The analysis uses OSeMOSYS, an open-source energy system model, with exogenously
    entered demand.
More Notes:
  2: Zimbabwe's electricity system is both carbon intensive and highly rainfall dependent.
  8: The analysis focuses on the energy sector in Zimbabwe and does not provide direct
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, or costs/benefits of adaptation. The reference
    to 'vulnerability to climate change' indicates that climate change risk will be
    considered subsequently in the paper.
  12: Short-term power shortages can occur even with adaptation measures due to the
    time needed to build new plants and reliance on hydropower. Clean adaptation needs
    less hydropower and coal compared to other scenarios. The study looks at the power
    sector specifically.
  13: The page predominantly focuses on energy projection graphs and does not provide
    detailed methodology or specific macroeconomic outcomes.
  14: The analysis does not fully account for the market and institutional restructuring
    costs associated with clean adaptation. Regional power trade could play a critical
    role in addressing climate change by enabling burden sharing across regions.
  16: Structural changes and market adjustments are required for clean growth scenarios.
    Specific regional market and technology characteristics need local adaptation.
  17: Clean adaptation requires strong commitment, political will, and restructuring
    of the power sector.
  18: Policy coherence within and across sectors is emphasized, particularly in energy
    infrastructure deployment.
  19: The work could be valuably extended from Zimbabwe to assess the Southern African
    region due to the impact and transboundary nature of power trade and river basins,
    as well as the deep vulnerabilities counterbalanced by the opportunity for climate
    compatible growth (CCG).
  21: Data is based on official national documents (helpful for dialogue) but is limited
    and should be updated as data are available. Electricity demand is taken directly
    from the SDP and extended with a constant growth rate of 1.9% from 2035.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  2: Economic damage due to constrained electricity supply.
  7: No relevant information
  10: Food shortages, power cuts, crippled economy due to drought impacting key economic
    sectors like mines and farms. Deforestation due to biomass shortages.
  12: Economic damage (due to inaction or poorly planned action), cost to the economy
    of action/adaptation, energy-not-served (leading to economic damage)
  13: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes are detailed for nation-wide adaptation.
  14: Direct costs of adaptation (capital, operating and maintenance, fuel, and unserved
    energy costs) are lower in both coal and clean adaptation scenarios compared to
    the NDC 'no adaptation' scenario. Clean adaptation has marginally lower direct
    costs than coal adaptation.
  16: Meeting NDC targets without a climate resilience plan is economically dangerous
    and risks losing emissions gains.
  17: Economic damage (in billions of USD) or livelihood loss
  18: No relevant information
  19: "Zimbabwe's economic and environmental performance is at risk if clean adaptation\
    \ policies and measures (PAMs) are not implemented sensibly. There is potential\
    \ for Zimbabwe\u2019s growth to be both low carbon and economic if PAMs are implemented\
    \ sensibly."
Quantitative material:
  1: No relevant information
  2: Emissions will be reduced by 33% per capita by 2030 compared to a coal-based
    future.
  8: The NDC indicates a 5% reduction in energy demand by 2030 due to energy efficiency
    measures.
  10: Projected changes in precipitation, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration
    (PET) are presented for three climate scenarios (GISS-E2-H_run1, MIROC-ESM-CHEM,
    run1, bcc-csm1-1) through 2031-2040 compared to a 1950-1999 baseline. Precipitation
    changes range from -32.5% to +2.9%, temperature changes range from +2.06 to +2.60
    degrees Celsius, and PET changes range from +8.3% to +11.3%.
  12: Damage of inaction is more than double the cost to the economy of action, coal
    reinforcement case leads to a more than quadrupling of emissions, cost of the
    system to the economy in coal reinforcement case is less than half of that when
    there is inaction.
  13: Quantitative information related to energy projections under different adaptation
    scenarios with numerical trends from 2020 to 2050 is present.
  14: Coal adaptation direct costs are approximately -130 billion USD. Clean adaptation
    direct costs are approximately -115 billion USD.
  17: Billions of USD of economic damage are at stake.
  18: No relevant information
  21: Provides capital costs (USD/kW), variable costs (USD/GJ), fixed costs (USD/kW),
    fuel costs (USD/GJ), and efficiency for various energy technologies (Coal, Gas,
    Hydropower, Wind, Solar, Energy Efficiency). Also, provides anticipated capacity
    factors for specific hydropower stations.
