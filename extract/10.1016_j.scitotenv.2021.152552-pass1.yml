Drivers of Risk:
  2: The paper identifies natural hazards (geophysical, hydrological, climatological,
    meteorological) and their future evolution under climate change, population and
    socioeconomic growth, and land-use change as drivers of risk. It focuses on how
    these factors impact hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.
  3: Future emissions are a primary driver of climate-related hazards. Dynamic hazard
    features, like non-stationary annual maximum discharges and windspeeds, and ground-cover
    change, influence future projections of flooding and landslide hazards.
  8: The drivers of risk discussed are natural hazards, including those exacerbated
    by increasing human populations, urbanization, and climate change.
Highlights:
  8: The paper highlights the obstacles to quantifying future risk for management
    and mitigation purposes, including the uncertainty associated with future risk
    projections and the lack of a standard framework for end-to-end future risk modelling.
Methodology:
  2: The paper reviews state-of-practice methods and approaches in the literature
    to quantify and model risk from natural hazards in the future, focusing on hazard,
    exposure, and vulnerability. It focuses on the physical sciences and engineering
    perspective, with social vulnerability broadly outside the scope of the study.
    It also reviews the metrics used to define future risk. The approach is applicable
    to future risk assessments of natural hazards, focusing on climate-related and
    geophysical risks.
  3: The paper presents a typical methodological approach to modeling future climate-related
    hazards, involving emission scenarios, climate models, downscaling, event generation,
    and local intensity calculation.
  7: Uses an end-to-end risk quantification framework to account for the dynamic nature
    of hazard, vulnerability and exposure, incorporating climate change and socioeconomic
    factors.
  8: The paper reviews state-of-the-art approaches to future natural-hazard risk quantification,
    including methodologies to model future hazards, exposure, and vulnerability.
    It also suggests integrating cost-benefit analyses (CBA) into risk assessment
    procedures and incorporating an additional decision-making module.
More Notes:
  2: "The paper de\uFB01nes risk as the convolution of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.\
    \ It explicitly examines attempts to model each of these separate components into\
    \ the future."
  7: The paper discusses the challenges in modeling future risks due to inherent uncertainties
    in hazard, exposure, and vulnerability components and identifies a lack of a commonly
    accepted analytical framework for complete end-to-end risk quantification.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  8: The paper discusses risk metrics such as asset damage, business interruption,
    welfare losses, and travel-time delays, which can impact macroeconomic outcomes.
