Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, population growth, asset accumulation, and urbanization are identified
    as key drivers increasing risk from natural hazards.
  2: Changing climate conditions affecting natural hazards, such as storms, temperatures,
    and precipitation patterns, potentially increase future risks.
  3: Shocks or changes impacting outcomes include future climate-related hazards derived
    from emission scenarios and dynamic weather variables.
  4: Increases in population (urbanization), socioeconomic growth, choices on land
    use.
  5: Unplanned/informal modifications, maintenance/degradation challenges, environment-induced
    deterioration, accumulation of damage due to cascading hazard events (e.g., aftershocks),
    rising carbon dioxide levels.
  6: The changing climate is likely to inflict more damage on engineering assets,
    even if design standards remain unchanged. Hazards such as wind, cyclones, non-cyclonic
    windstorms, floods, sea-level rise, and tsunamis are considered.
  7: Natural variability, greenhouse gas emissions leading to climate change and extreme
    weather, population size, and economic growth drive future risk.
  8: The analysis considers modelling future hazards, exposure, and (physical) vulnerability
    in a changing climate.
  9: Multiple natural hazards are considered in the risk assessment framework.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Future risks from natural hazards are evaluated, considering interconnected factors
    like exposure, vulnerability, and hazards.
  2: The paper aims to provide an overview of methodologies and approaches in the
    literature to quantify and model risk from future natural hazards.
  4: Exposure to natural hazards leading to potential losses.
  5: Physical vulnerability of infrastructure, specifically the tendency of exposed
    assets to suffer adverse effects when impacted by natural hazards.
  6: This paper provides an overview of quantitative natural-hazard risk assessments
    centering on the future vulnerability of the built environment and socioeconomic
    factors.
  7: No relevant information
  8: The frameworks discussed assess future risk in terms of asset damage, business
    interruption, welfare losses, and travel-time delays.
  9: The paper proposes a risk modelling framework that aims to produce consequence
    values related to socio-economic and technical network impacts, not just economic
    and building-level loss.
Highlights:
  1: 'The paper explores work modeling and quantifying future risks from natural hazards
    and focuses on the individual components of risk: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.'
  2: There is a critical importance of evaluating risks to natural hazards with a
    future-focused lens for informed decision-making.
  5: Vulnerability can increase due to modifications or degradation but can be reduced
    by adapting infrastructure. The paper highlights studies incorporating future
    weather and climate conditions in assessing corrosion and damage to concrete infrastructure.
  6: Studies examine the risk, costs, and benefits of climate adaptation strategies,
    the economic viability of mitigation strategies, and the effect of future flooding
    risk.
  7: Modeling future risk is challenged by inherent uncertainty in hazard, exposure,
    and vulnerability, and there is a lack of a commonly accepted analytical framework
    for complete end-to-end risk quantification.
  8: The paper highlights the need for a standard framework for end-to-end future
    risk modelling that captures multiple hazards, accounts for network-level disruptions,
    incorporates a broad set of risk metrics, and facilitates diverse stakeholder
    perspectives.
  9: The proposed framework advances conventional risk assessment by including multiple
    hazards, a flexible suite of risk metrics (including socio-economic and technical
    networks), and stakeholder perspectives.
Methodology:
  1: The paper reviews work that models and quantifies individual components of risk
    (hazard, exposure, and vulnerability) to understand future risks. It examines
    future natural hazards affected by climate change, future exposure, and evolving
    physical vulnerabilities.
  2: Future risk assessment involves analyzing the interplay of hazard, exposure,
    and vulnerability; incorporates climate models with information on possible future
    scenarios.
  3: The analysis is performed through a methodological process involving emission
    scenarios, climate models, downscaled climate models, event generation, and local
    intensity calculation.
  4: Future population and economic growth are commonly modeled on the basis of socioeconomic
    scenario storylines (SRES, SSPs).
  5: Review of modeling approaches, including time-dependent earthquake fragility,
    Markov chains to quantify building transitions, and models coupling convection,
    chloride binding, and concrete ageing.
  6: The paper discusses approaches to accounting for adapted vulnerability, including
    climate adaptation engineering, adaptation policies, and GDP growth. Risk metrics
    are used to bridge the gap between quantitative risk assessment and decision-making.
  7: Discusses challenges in modeling future risk from natural hazards due to uncertainties
    in hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, and inconsistencies in approaches for
    calculating future loss projections. Describes end-to-end risk quantification
    frameworks.
  8: The paper reviews state-of-the-art approaches to future natural-hazard risk quantification,
    including various methodologies to model tomorrow's hazards, exposure, and (physical)
    vulnerability.
  9: The paper outlines a stakeholder-centered end-to-end risk modelling framework
    for future natural hazards. This framework expands upon conventional risk assessments
    by incorporating multiple hazards, a flexible suite of risk metrics, and stakeholder
    perspectives. Feedback loops are used to incorporate stakeholder perspectives,
    plans, and priorities into the quantification and selection of risk metrics.

    uncontrolled development in hazardous areas, aligning with the Sendai Framework
    for Disaster Risk Reduction.

    of dynamic changes in structural vulnerability and the potential impact of adaptation
    measures.
  7: Decision makers can influence future risks through choices on strategies/policies
    that control future risk drivers.
