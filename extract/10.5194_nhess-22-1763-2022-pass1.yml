Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, population growth, and upstream land use changes increasing the
    risk of water shortage due to droughts.
  2: Drought-induced water shortage, climate change (historical situations and future
    projections), socio-economic developments, salt water intrusion, low river flows.
  3: Drought hazard measured as cumulative precipitation deficit (difference between
    potential evapotranspiration and precipitation) in the growing season (April to
    September); low river flows in the Rhine and/or the Meuse rivers.
  4: Droughts causing water shortage, reduced water levels in waterways, soil moisture
    deficits, salinity stress, deteriorating water quality.
  5: Climate change (temperature rise, changes in circulation patterns), Socio-economic
    developments (population and economic growth), Declining water quality during
    droughts.
  6: Climate change scenarios affecting precipitation, evapotranspiration, and sea
    level rise; Socio-economic scenarios impacting population, economic growth, and
    land use; Changes in irrigation, water extraction for industry and drinking water,
    and water demand for flushing salinized polder systems.
  7: A warmer climate is expected to increase annual precipitation and evapotranspiration,
    with uncertainty in precipitation patterns during the growing season potentially
    increasing droughts.
  8: Increased drought, related salt water intrusion, and low-flow periods in the
    Rhine river are identified as key drivers of risk.
  9: Changes in meteorological and hydrological drought probability under different
    climate scenarios (G and W H), land use, population, and policy actions. Specifically,
    the maximum cumulative precipitation deficit and the duration of low flows in
    the Rhine and Meuse rivers.
  10: Drought, Water shortage
  11: Drought-induced water shortage, future uncertainty in water supply and demand.
Highlights:
  1: "Presents a method to quantify drought risk in the Netherlands under changing\
    \ future conditions and in response to policy actions to support decision making\
    \ on the Netherlands\u2019 national drought risk management strategy."
  2: Presents an integrated drought risk assessment framework applicable to the Dutch
    Delta Programme; demonstrates applicability of the framework by showing results
    of a selection of policy actions for two regions in the Netherlands; framework
    helps the minister to allocate funds for drought risk mitigation.
  4: Drought risk curve shows the probability distribution of the welfare effects,
    from which risk indicators such as the expected annual economic impact can be
    derived. The impact of droughts was quantified in monetary terms for shipping,
    drinking water, industry, and agriculture.
  5: Industry invests in adaptation measures to keep the probability of production
    stops very low under changing conditions; Drinking water companies will increase
    consumer prices to cover adaptation costs.
  6: Policy actions are evaluated based on a societal welfare perspective, considering
    both monetized effects (drought risk reduction) and non-monetized effects. Policy
    actions are selected through a funneling process, considering drought risk reduction,
    societal goals, and political support. A standard discount rate of 3%-4.5% is
    used.
  7: Drought risk in the Netherlands is projected to increase significantly by 2050
    under the worst-case climate change scenarios.
  8: Drought risk in the Netherlands is projected to increase, especially impacting
    agriculture and shipping, requiring adaptation strategies with specific policy
    actions.
  9: Drought risk in the Netherlands is projected to increase from 372 million euros
    per year to 611 million euros per year under the 'Stoom2050' scenario.
  10: Dynamic simulation of drought risk allows quantitative evaluation of costs and
    benefits of planned drought adaptation investments. The emergency supply route
    for the region North could further increase water shortage in the region Southwest,
    and adjusted distribution of river water significantly reduces the adaptation
    costs of the drinking water sector but increases drought risk for shipping.
  11: Drought risk assessment can support the development of adaptive strategies through
    determining the opportune time to invest, considering the uncertainty about future
    developments in both water supply and demand. National-scale risk assessment provides
    insight into how costs and benefits are distributed over the different regions
    and sectors.
Methodology:
  1: Quantifies drought risk by integrating drought probability and socio-economic
    consequences. Used in a societal cost-benefit analysis to build an adaptive long-term
    strategy.
  2: 'Integrated drought risk assessment framework with four steps: (1) Analyze drought
    probability using a long time series of hydrological and meteorological variables.
    (2) Simulate time series with a national hydrological model and couple economic
    impact models for agriculture, shipping, industry, and drinking water. (3) Compare
    costs of policy actions with changes in drought risks for different climate change
    and socio-economic scenarios. (4) Determine the opportune time to invest. Evaluation
    based on societal costs and benefits. Dynamics simulation of the hydrological
    system and couple impact models that propagate water shortage to societal and
    economic impact.'
  3: Drought risk assessment framework using a 100-year historic time series of precipitation
    and evaporation; hydrological models to predict future drought probability; impact
    models to assess physical impacts and welfare effects.
  4: Uses the National Water Model to simulate drought propagation, AGRICOM model
    to assess crop yield reduction and irrigation costs, an economic tool to assess
    impact of crop yield reduction and higher irrigation costs on national welfare,
    BIVAS model to calculate transport costs based on water levels, and an economic
    module to add costs of temporary storage.
  5: Risk analysis assumes adaptation investments are aimed at maintaining the failure
    probability of production stops under future scenarios; Required adaptation investment
    estimated by calculating the additional treatment capacity required due to increased
    exceedance of concentration of indicating substances at water intakes; Shadow
    price of water is derived from the agricultural impact model outcomes, as a regression
    between crop evapotranspiration and crop yield minus the additional costs of irrigation;
    The effect of policy actions was analysed for the reference situation and Stoom
    scenario only.
  6: "A societal cost\u2013benefit analysis is used to evaluate policy actions, considering\
    \ investment costs, operation and maintenance costs, and hydrological effects.\
    \ Stakeholder input is used and tested for consistency, relying on previous cost-benefit\
    \ analyses and expert information. Costs are translated into equal annual annuity\
    \ (EAA) to compare measures with different lifespans. Risk reduction is compared\
    \ to annual cost, and policy actions are evaluated based on whether the avoided\
    \ drought risk is greater than or equal to costs."
  7: Investment timing is determined by interpolating results between scenarios and
    averaging them; the opportune time to invest is where costs and benefits intersect.
  8: The paper uses process-based hydrological models, impact models, and economic
    cost-benefit analysis to quantify changes in drought risk. The analysis appears
    to be specific to the Netherlands and considers scenarios up to 2050.
  9: A dynamic simulation approach is used, coupling impact models with a hydrological
    simulation model. Market price methods are used for agriculture and shipping.
    Avoided cost approach is used for drinking water and industry. Water shortage
    is monetized using an assumed shadow price of water.
  10: Dynamic simulation of drought risk, cost-benefit analysis, national-scale hydrological
    model
  11: Process-based method for integrated drought risk assessment, coupling hydrological
    models with socio-economic impact functions. Dynamic impact model lacking for
    certain effects, using a shadow price of water instead.
More Notes:
  3: The study focuses on the Netherlands and considers the influence of major rivers
    (Rhine, Meuse) and their low-flow periods on drought conditions. The framework
    includes both current and future projections and aims to inform adaptive strategy
    development through cost-benefit evaluations of policy actions.
  4: Focuses on national welfare effects within the Netherlands, excluding costs of
    foreign consumers or producers.
  5: The shadow price of water is defined as the marginal value of an additional cubic
    metre of water during periods of water shortage.
  6: The analysis is part of the national Delta Programme, involving government authorities
    and fresh-water users. The analysis uses climate change scenarios adapted from
    Wolters et al. (2018) and river discharge data from Rijkswaterstaat.
  8: The paper considers both monetized and non-monetized effects (e.g., recreational
    value, supply reliability, urban heat stress reduction) in the cost-benefit analysis
    of adaptation measures.
  9: The paper recommends improving impact calculations for drought-induced soil subsidence
    and developing a method to better incorporate the impact on ecosystems and biodiversity.
  10: "The model has limitations related to the large spatial scale, level of detail,\
    \ and computation times. Uncertainties exist in the hydrological system representation,\
    \ future scenarios, economic impact models, and cost-benefit analysis. The agricultural\
    \ impact model does not include the impact on farmers\u2019 livelihoods."
  11: The study uses a discount rate of 4.5%, but a sensitivity analysis with 3% did
    not change preferred strategies; A dynamic impact model is lacking for the economic
    effect of water shortage for flushing and water level management, which introduces
    uncertainty.
