Drivers of Risk:
  1: Exposure to floods and droughts.
  2: Floods and droughts.
  4: Floods and droughts (exposed areas).
  7: Floods (linked to monsoon rain) and droughts (linked to below average monsoon
    rain).
  8: Floods (above-average monsoon and annual rainfall), Droughts (below-average rainfall),
    Cyclones.
  9: Floods and Droughts.
  10: Area exposed to floods (FLEA) and area exposed to droughts (DREA).
  11: Exposure to floods and droughts.
  12: Percentage area exposed to floods, percentage area exposed to droughts, and
    lagged values of these exposures.
  13: Floods and Droughts
  14: Floods and droughts.
  15: Floods and droughts are identified as drivers of risk. Over-exploitation of
    groundwater resources is mentioned as a factor contributing to unsustainable growth
    trajectories in some regions.
  17: Natural disasters; Floods; Drought; Climate Change
Highlights:
  1: Floods expose a large area, but droughts have the most significant impact at
    the sub-national level in India.
  2: "Sub-national analysis of impacts of \uFB02oods and droughts exposure is vital\
    \ given the massive investments on mitigation and adaptation to natural hazards."
  4: Study assesses trends of exposed areas and GSDP to floods and droughts; Panel
    data analysis evaluates impacts on GSDP, state HDI, and economic growth.
  7: Floods and droughts can have carry-over effects on economic growth. Growth of
    GSDP and human development enhances the adaptation and mitigation capacity to
    floods and droughts.
  8: Eastern region states (Bihar, Assam) have high exposure to floods and low GSDP.
    Drought exposure was most extensive in the southern, western, and central states,
    decreasing over time. Punjab, Haryana, and Gujarat have increasing flood exposure
    after 2010 despite mitigating drought impacts.
  10: FLEAs are generally associated with significantly higher GSDP, except in the
    NWR. There seem to be statistically significant impacts of flood mitigation investments,
    especially in the ER, and SWR.
  11: Drought exposure generally had a negative impact on GDP.
  12: Lagged drought exposure negatively influences non-agriculture sector GDP in
    the ER. Flood exposure in the NWR has a positive influence on non-agriculture
    GDP. Floods generally have a negative influence on HDI, except in the NWR. Lagged
    drought exposure has a negative influence on HDI.
  13: Floods do not significantly affect GSDP and HDI in the Eastern Region (ER) due
    to mitigation and adaptation investments. Droughts generally impact GSDP in all
    states, but significantly through the non-agriculture sector. Droughts significantly
    negatively impact agriculture GSDP only in the NCR, indicating inadequate adaptation.
  14: Floods have localized destruction but contribute to groundwater recharge, benefiting
    industries and service sectors. Droughts have significant spatial distribution
    and impact both agriculture and non-agriculture sectors.
  15: Flood exposure has a positive impact in North Western Region (NWR) states (e.g.,
    Punjab and Haryana) due to groundwater recharge. Flood mitigation and adaptation
    are critical in Eastern Region (ER) states to assist livelihoods, where there
    is the lowest GSDP and highest poverty. Diversification of economic activities
    is needed in South Western Region (SWR) states to high-value crops in agriculture,
    and high-value industries and services in non-agriculture.
Methodology:
  1: Fixed-effect panel regression using satellite data to estimate flood and drought
    exposure in 19 Indian states (representing 95% of the population and 93% of national
    GDP) from 2001-2015.
  2: The analysis uses gridded time-series information of floods and droughts exposed
    areas derived from fine-scale satellite data. Considers 19 major states, which
    account for 95% of the total population and 93% of the national GDP in 2015. Excludes
    union territories and northeastern states due to data unavailability.
  4: Panel data analysis at the state level to evaluate the impacts of floods and
    droughts.
  7: State and time fixed effect panel regression models are used to assess the impact
    of flood and drought exposed areas on GSDP, sectoral GDP per capita, and HDI.
    Equations (1) and (2) assess the influence of flood and drought exposed areas
    on the GSDP exposed to floods and droughts. Equation (3) assesses the impact of
    current and previous years flood and drought exposed areas on sectoral and total
    GSDP per person and HDI.
  8: Two-stage least-squares regression analysis with monthly rainfall and deviation
    of monsoon and non-monsoon season rainfall from the averages as instrumental variables.
    Wu-Hausman test for endogeneity. Wald and Sargens test for suitability and overidentifiability
    of models.
  10: Time and state fixed panel regressions. The analysis considers all states, and
    also breaks them into ER (Eastern Region), SWR (South Western Region), NCR (National
    Capital Region), and NWR (North Western Region).
  11: Fixed effects panel regression analysis at the state level.
  12: Panel regressions with state fixed effects are used to estimate the impact of
    flood and drought exposure on per-capita GSDP and HDI. Results are presented for
    all states, and for the Eastern Region (ER), Southern and Western Region (SWR),
    North Central Region (NCR), and North Western Region (NWR).
  14: State-level analysis of the intra-country impacts of natural disasters (floods
    and droughts).
  15: The study uses remote sensing data assessment, exposure analysis, and statistical
    data analysis.

    temporal changes in flooding using MODIS time-series imagery; Remote Sensing;

More Notes:
  1: GSDPs in non-agriculture sectors are positively impacted by floods and negatively
    impacted by droughts; no significant influence on HDI was found.
  2: The paper attempts to shift the focus from the national to the sub-national level
    assessments on the relationship between natural disasters and economic growth.
  4: States are divided into four groups (ER, SWR, NCR, NWR) based on geography, hydrogeology,
    and GSDP to account for regional differences in flood dynamics and water availability.
  7: The drought-exposed area (DREA) is the maximum area exposed to meteorological
    or agricultural droughts. The Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI) identifies
    the drought-exposed pixels, which is a function of the Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) estimated from satellite
    images. For floods, the analysis considers data of years with above-average monsoon
    rainfall, mainly between June and September, while for droughts, the focus is
    on years with below-average monsoon rainfall, mainly between October and May.
  8: The study uses FLEA, DREA, and GSDP to assess the economic impact of floods and
    droughts in different states of India. The paper studies the years 2003, 2010,
    and 2013 for floods and years with below-average rainfall for droughts.
  9: The page provides a figure illustrating exposure but lacks specific quantitative
    data or analysis.
  10: The relationship between flood and drought exposure and GSDP varies by region.
    The Wald and Sargen tests show that the instrumental variables are very weak.
    The aggregated state-level data used in the analysis generally hid these locally
    concentrated positive impacts.
  11: Groundwater recharge from floods is critical for livelihood and economic activities
    in many states during the non-rainy period.
  12: The study notes that varying exposures to floods and droughts were associated
    with significant growth in GDP per capita across all regions. Adaptation actions
    by the non-agriculture sector may explain different results in the SWR. Increased
    groundwater supply from floods in the NWR may explain the positive impact of floods
    on HDI. Investments on flood mitigation may have had secondary impacts, facilitating
    water supply, sanitation, and education, which are the other components of HDI.
  13: The paper focuses on intra-country variations in India and suggests the need
    for boosting investments in flood and drought mitigation and adaptation measures.
    Different regions require different strategies.
  14: Adaptation to droughts is crucial for growth in both agriculture and non-agriculture
    sectors in the absence of adequate water resources.
  15: The study acknowledges that results are confounded by large intra-state variation
    in hydro-geological and socio-economic conditions. The authors call for future
    research to focus on risk profiling at finer spatial resolution (districts or
    sub-districts) to better target mitigation and adaptation responses.
