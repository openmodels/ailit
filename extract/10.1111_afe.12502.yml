Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5)
  2: Climate change, specifically global warming and increasing CO2 levels, and invasive
    species are identified as drivers of risk.
  3: Climatic variables from the WorldClim database (19 bioclimatic variables from
    1970-2000).
  4: No relevant information
  5: No relevant information
  6: Temperature seasonality (bio_4), annual average temperature (bio_1), and annual
    precipitation (bio_12) are identified as important environmental variables influencing
    the occurrence of Aceria guerreronis.
  7: Climate change (future predictions under SSP2.6 and SSP8.5)
  8: Climate conditions in 2040 and 2060 under shared socio-economic pathway (SSP2.6).
  11: "The key climatic factors influencing the distribution of A. guerreronis are\
    \ temperature (ideal range 9.3-33.6\xB0C, detrimental above 40\xB0C, can survive\
    \ brief frost), drought, and high temperatures. The model predicts a contraction\
    \ of suitable areas from SSPs 2.6 to 8.5 due to rising global temperatures and\
    \ a shift of ecological range in certain areas."

  11: The paper evaluates the potential distribution of the coconut mite (A. guerreronis)
    and how climate change impacts this distribution.
  14: The listed papers cover impacts on species distributions, crop loss, pest management,
    and extinction/survival of species.
Highlights:
  1: The MaxEnt model predicts the habitat suitability for A. guerreronis outside
    its present distribution, with suitable habitats in Oceania, Asia, Africa, and
    the Americas.
  2: The coconut mite (Aceria guerreronis) is an invasive pest that poses a serious
    threat to the coconut industry worldwide, and climate change affects its distribution.
  3: Provides information for the implementation of quarantine measures and highlight
    the need for policy formulation regarding coconut mite distribution.
  4: MaxEnt model provided satisfactory results with an AUC value of 0.975 for predicting
    the distribution of *Aceria guerreronis*.
  5: Persistent correlation between Aceria guerreronis occurrence and environmental
    conditions such as seasonality of temperature and annual precipitation.
  6: Temperature seasonality, annual average temperature, and annual precipitation
    are the best predictors of Aceria guerreronis occurrence.
  7: Future predictions show an expansion of habitat suitability from the current
    time to the future under SSP2.6. Major coconut-producing countries like Indonesia,
    India, Sri Lanka, Brazil, Vietnam, and the Philippines will continue to remain
    suitable in the future under SSP2.6.  Under SSP8.5, the model predicts that suitable
    areas for A. guerreronis will decrease from 2040 to 2060, but the areas with medium
    to high suitability will mainly be found on the west and east coasts of Africa,
    the east coast of South America, south and east coasts of Asia, and the north
    coast of Oceania.
  8: The model predicts shifts in habitat suitability for Aceria guerreronis under
    future climate conditions, with variations depending on the dataset used (all
    occurrences, excluding Ghana, only Ghana).
  11: Climate change will significantly impact the global distribution of A. guerreronis.
    The model predicts an expansion of habitat suitability outside the known distribution,
    particularly in Indonesia, Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, Mexico, Thailand, and Myanmar.
    The model also predicts that regions currently unsuitable for coconut mites (e.g.,
    Brazil, India, Australia, Nigeria, and Kenya) will become suitable habitats by
    2040.
Methodology:
  1: Machine learning algorithm based on maximum entropy (MaxEnt), AR6
  2: Species distribution models (SDMs), particularly Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), are
    used to predict habitat suitability based on environmental data. SDMs are identified
    as useful tools for evaluating potential pest responses to climate change at large
    spatial and temporal scales.
  3: Used MaxEnt to model and map regions suitable for coconut mites, using climatic
    data from WorldClim. Spatial filtering using the R package spThin was used to
    reduce spatial autocorrelation. The Maximum Test Sensitivity Plus Specificity
    (MTSPS) threshold was used to extract suitable/unsuitable areas.
  4: "MaxEnt model based on 19 bioclimatic datasets; 80% of occurring sites used as\
    \ training data, 20% as test data; four suitability classes (unsuitable: 0-MTSPS;\
    \ low: MTSPS-0.5; medium: 0.5 \u20130.7 and high: 0.7 \u20131.0) used to predict\
    \ future areas."
  5: Environmental niche models were developed using MaxEnt model and jackknife tests
    to evaluate contribution of environmental variables.
  6: The analysis uses a jackknife test of regularized training gain and a jackknife
    of AUC to assess the relative importance of environmental variables. Response
    curves are generated to show the relationship between environmental variables
    and Aceria guerreronis occurrence, based on regularized training gain. The model
    is based on 10 replicates (for response curves).
  7: Species distribution modeling based on current distribution and future climate
    scenarios (SSP2.6 and SSP8.5).
  8: Species distribution modeling was used to predict habitat suitability based on
    climate scenarios and occurrence data of Aceria guerreronis. The model was run
    using all occurrences, occurrences excluding Ghana, and only Ghana occurrences.
  11: The study uses bioclimatic variables and elevation datasets to model the distribution
    of A. guerreronis under two socioeconomic pathways (SSPs 2.6 and 8.5), projecting
    from the current time to 2060. The authors used a filtering method to reduce spatial
    aggregation of records in their models.
  14: MaxEnt modeling is used in several studies to predict species distributions
    under climate change scenarios.
More Notes:
  1: Areas with the highest risk have annual average temperature of around 25 degrees
    Celsius, mean annual precipitation of about 1459 mm, mean precipitation seasonality
    close to 64%, average variation of daytime temperature of about 8.6 degrees Celsius,
    and mean seasonality of temperature of about 149.7 degrees Celsius.
  3: Occurrence data was gathered from a nationwide survey in Ghana (April 2019 -
    February 2021) and supplemented by a literature search and online databases.
  4: The study models the distribution of *Aceria guerreronis*, a species illustrated
    in the figure. The maps (A, B, C) depict the initial, thinned, and final occurrences
    used for modelling.
  5: The analysis primarily focuses on the predicted distribution of A. guerreronis,
    with no direct mention of broader climate-related impacts.
  6: The paper examines the impact of climate variables on the occurrence of the species
    Aceria guerreronis, likely a pest based on the journal title. The analysis focuses
    on identifying key environmental drivers and quantifying their influence on the
    species distribution using training gain and AUC. Logistic output responses of
    the species to temperature seasonality, annual average temperature, and annual
    precipitation are shown.
  7: The analysis appears to be focused on habitat suitability rather than direct
    impacts such as coconut yield or mortality.
  8: The maps show that the spatial distribution of suitable habitats for the pest
    will likely shift across South America, Africa, and Asia in 2040 and 2060.
  11: The model predictions are consistent with the historical records of the pest.
    The authors acknowledge limitations, including the lack of consideration of host
    plants in the model, anthropogenic activities, and other factors like geographic
    barriers and land-use changes. The authors suggest the model should be continually
    run when A. guerreronis records are updated.

  6: AUC values range from 0.72 to 0.98 for the jackknife of AUC analysis.
  7: Model predicts a reduction in habitat suitability from 2040 to 2060 under SSP8.5.
  8: Projections of habitat suitability (high, medium, low, unsuitable) are presented
    visually in maps for 2040 and 2060 under SSP2.6, but no specific numbers are given.
  11: The study predicts a shift in the ecological range of A. guerreronis such that
    areas presently highly suitable will become less so by 2060.
