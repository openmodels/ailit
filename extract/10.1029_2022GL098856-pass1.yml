Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increasing frequency and intensity of very wet monsoon seasons due to climate
    change (specifically under SSP5-8.5 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios).
  4: Unabated climate change (SSP5-8.5) leads to a general shift of the precipitation
    distribution toward wetter seasons in the Indian monsoon region.
  5: Increased frequency of very wet Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) seasons due to climate
    change. Projected changes in daily precipitation amount and number of wet days.
  8: Increased frequency and severity of very strong monsoon rainfall seasons, shift
    from light to moderate/heavy rainfall days, and projected population growth in
    India.
Highlights:
  1: Very wet monsoon seasons are projected to increase significantly in frequency
    and intensity under climate change, with the increase being lower under a moderate
    mitigation scenario (SSP2-4.5) compared to a high emission scenario (SSP5-8.5).
  4: The Indian monsoon region is projected to experience more frequent and severe
    wet seasons under unabated climate change. Dry seasons are projected to be rarer.
    A significant increase beyond the observed natural variability emerges in 2027,
    which accelerates non-linearly.
  5: "We found a clear, general increase of the yearly ISM rainfall between 1965-2015\
    \ and 2050\u20132100 toward wetter seasons. Under SSP5-8.5, the increasing trend\
    \ becomes significant in 2027."
  8: Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and severity of very wet
    ISM seasons, potentially threatening food security in India.
Methodology:
  1: Uses the latest generation of coupled climate models to project changes in monsoon
    seasons.
  4: CMIP6 models are used to project future monsoon rainfall patterns under different
    SSP scenarios. Historical data from 1965-2015 are used as a baseline. The 90th
    percentile of rainfall during the baseline period is used as a threshold for defining
    'very wet' seasons.
  8: Analysis of 32 CMIP6 climate models to project changes in very wet Indian Summer
    Monsoon (ISM) seasons under different climate change scenarios (SSP5-8.5, SSP2-4.5,
    SSP1-2.6) between 1965-2015 and 2050-2100.
More Notes:
  1: The study also finds a shift from days with light rainfall to days with moderate
    or heavy rainfall, and an increase in the number of wet days.
  4: The Himalayan region, Bangladesh, the west coast, and central India are projected
    to experience the most intense monsoon rainfall intensification. The study acknowledges
    that water availability also depends on evaporation, which was not the focus of
    the study.
  5: Focuses on changes in rainfall patterns (frequency and intensity) during the
    Indian summer monsoon. Includes some spatial distribution of the changes, but
    focused on rainfall metrics, not macroeconomic effects. Mentions different SSP
    scenarios.
  8: The study focuses on changes in daily rainfall patterns within monsoon seasons,
    finding a shift from light to moderate/heavy rainfall days. The increased frequency
    of very strong ISM rainfall seasons needs further study to implement adaptation
    strategies in agriculture.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Mentions potential impacts on crop yields, food security, water management, and
    the country's economy due to changes in monsoon rainfall.
  4: No relevant information
  5: No relevant information
  8: Impact of monsoon rainfall changes on crop yields and food security in India.
Quantitative material:
  1: Under SSP5-8.5, very wet monsoon seasons (as observed in 5 years in 1965-2015)
    are projected to occur 8 times more often in 2050-2100. Under SSP2-4.5, these
    seasons become 6 times more frequent.
  4: "The Indian monsoon region will experience a general increase from mean seasonal\
    \ summer rainfall of the Indian monsoon toward wetter years between the historical\
    \ (1965\u20132015) and the future period (2050\u20132100) in the Indian monsoon\
    \ region under unabated climate change (SSP5-8.5). In SSP1-2.6 the increase is\
    \ to 6.2 mm/day. The variation is within multi-model mean plus one standard deviation\
    \ (based on the historical CMIP6 data ranging from 1950 to 2015) for 1950\u2013\
    2027, but a significant increase beyond the observed natural variability emerges\
    \ in 2027, which accelerates non-linearly."
  8: Very wet seasons that used to occur in 5 out of 50 years (1965-2015) are projected
    to appear in 39 out of 50 years (2050-2100) under SSP5-8.5, and 29 out of 50 years
    under SSP2-4.5.
