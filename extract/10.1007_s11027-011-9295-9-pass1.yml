Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts across regions and economic sectors. Vulnerability factors
    in rural communities (demography, occupations, earnings, literacy, poverty incidence,
    dependency on government funds). Water stress and increased energy costs.
  3: Climate change and climatic variability.
  5: Adverse climatic impacts on agriculture; lower shares of highly skilled jobs
    and lower returns to college degrees in rural labor markets; high unemployment
    in rural areas.
  8: Climate change altering or shifting job opportunities in recreation, potentially
    reducing winter recreation (e.g., skiing) and increasing summer recreation (e.g.,
    golf, hiking).
  11: Higher temperatures; increased CO2 levels; invasive weed species; premature
    plant development; late-season frosts; increased winter and spring precipitation
    and flooding; increased intensity of precipitation and heavy downpours; climate
    change
  12: No relevant information
  15: Increased wildfire risk, increased disturbances from insects and invasive species,
    changes in temperature and precipitation affecting composition and diversity of
    native animals and plants, higher levels of atmospheric CO2.
  16: Climate change impacts on forest harvesting, including altered harvesting frequency,
    wildfire risk, pest attacks, and tree diseases; Warmer winters with sporadic freezing
    and thawing leading to increased erosion and landslides on forest roads, and reduced
    access for winter harvesting; Increased incidences of droughts, changing precipitation
    intensity and runoff, lower availability of water for irrigation, changing water
    demands, and lower water availability for energy production.
  17: Increases in temperature and demand for energy; climate change impacting fisheries
    and marine ecosystems; shifts in species composition affecting subsistence and
    commercial fishing livelihoods.
  19: Climate change impacts resources availability affecting rural communities, including
    ecosystem services and vulnerability to climate change.
Highlights:
  1: Rural U.S. population is more vulnerable to climate change than urban counterparts.
    Climate change impacts differ across regions and economic sectors. Geography and
    vulnerability of rural communities impact climate change tradeoffs.
  5: Rural counties tend to be poorer than their urban counterparts, with lower per
    capita income and slower earnings growth. The Southeast stand out as being plagued
    by high unemployment, suggesting lower coping capacities to the adverse impacts
    of climate change.
  8: Rural communities, heavily reliant on recreation-related jobs, are particularly
    vulnerable to climate change impacts on the recreation sector.
  11: Climate change may increase agricultural production costs and impact crop yields.
    Weed control is a significant cost that is likely to increase. Climate change
    impacts forage production and quality, and can increase livestock production costs.

  15: No relevant information
  16: Climate change impacts on water resources could result in increasing incidences
    of droughts, changing precipitation intensity and runoff, lower availability of
    water for irrigation, changing water demands, and lower water availability for
    energy production, particularly in the Southwest.
  17: Rural communities may be more vulnerable to increased electricity demand costs;
    potential reductions in salmon populations and shifts in fisheries due to climate
    change.
  19: Increased use of renewable energy sources can mitigate adverse effects of climate
    change while enhancing rural community resilience; stakeholder involvement and
    indigenous knowledge integration are essential for effective climate policy.
Methodology:
  1: Extensive literature review to make inferences about the rural communities' vulnerability
    to climate change based on IPCC scenarios.
  3: Analysis based on inferences from Global Climate Models (GCMs) under three SRES
    emissions scenarios (B1, A2, A1F1), only drawing inferences when climate variable
    trends are consistent across all three scenarios.

    on energy and fisheries, but specific methodologies used are not detailed on this
    page.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the socio-economic impacts of climate change on rural communities
    in the United States, highlighting vulnerabilities and regional differences. It
    suggests that rural communities in agriculture and forestry in the Northeast may
    benefit, while those in the Southwest and Southeast could face challenges.
  3: The paper focuses on social and economic impacts of future climate variability
    on rural communities in the U.S.
  11: The graph illustrates that yields have generally increased despite fluctuations,
    emphasizing the role of technology, and also the risks of climate events, in particular
    droughts, wet springs and early frosts.

  15: The page focuses primarily on the impact of climate change on forest resources
    and related rural communities, but doesn't provide quantification of macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level, only referencing regional/state
    level effects from other studies.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  3: Economic impacts include increased risk and uncertainty of forest and agricultural
    production; alteration in productivity for crops and forest products; changes
    in supply of ecosystem goods and services; altered cost of utilities and services.
  5: Rural communities are expected to disproportionately experience the adverse climatic
    impacts on agriculture.
  8: Potential shifts in job opportunities and economic activity within the recreation
    sector, impacting the livelihoods of communities.
  11: Agricultural production costs (weed control, herbicide use); crop yields; livestock
    production costs; forage production and quality; damage to crops and natural vegetation
    from events like frost and flooding

  15: No relevant information
  16: Contracting forest industry leading to loss of employment for many rural communities.
  17: Energy sector pressures could impact rural communities' access to traditional
    energy sources, with potential implications for increased electricity costs.
  19: Research into alternative energy sources, specifically cellulosic based energy
    sources, may have economic benefits in terms of rural job creation and improving
    rural economy and quality of life.

  5: Per capita income in urban areas ($32,077) far exceeded per capita income in
    micropolitans ($23,338) and non-core counties ($21,005). Between 1993 and 2004,
    rural areas averaged 0.5% annual growth in real earnings compared to 1.2% per
