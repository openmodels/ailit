Drivers of Risk:
  2: Weather fluctuations, specifically temperature increases and changes in precipitation.
  3: Temperature changes and rainfall fluctuations
  4: Climate change impacts livestock production via altered reproduction, feed conversion
    ratio, diseases, and migration of herders leading to communal clashes.
  6: Average temperature (oC), Total precipitation (mm)
  7: Temperature and precipitation changes
  8: Temperature and precipitation fluctuations.
  9: The primary shocks or changes impacting the outcomes are temperature fluctuations
    and precipitation changes, affecting cereal and beef production.
  10: Temperature and precipitation changes.
  11: Temperature and precipitation changes due to climate change.
Highlights:
  2: Climate change is projected to significantly reduce animal output in the future.
  3: Temperature changes have a robust negative effect on global livestock production,
    while rainfall fluctuations have a positive impact. The negative effect of temperature
    is more concentrated in hot, poor, and agricultural-dependent countries.
  4: No relevant information
  6: Temperature has a negative and statistically significant relationship with beef
    production; a 1 oC increase in temperature will lead to a 9.7% reduction in beef
    production. The impact of temperature is higher in tropical regions than in temperate
    regions.
  7: Temperature changes are more severe in hot, poor, and agriculture-dependent countries.
    The positive effect of precipitation changes in these regions attenuates the negative
    impact of temperature rise on beef production.
  8: Annual weather fluctuations have a statistically significant impact on beef production.
    There is a negative impact of temperature on cereal yields and production, more
    pronounced in hot countries. A 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature is associated
    with a 3.7% drop in cereal yields. A 1 degree Celsius higher temperature is associated
    with a 7.6% drop in global cereal production. Increased precipitation is associated
    with increased cereal yield.
  9: Higher temperatures negatively affect cereal yields, with the impact being more
    pronounced in tropical countries. The analysis suggests limited evidence of medium-term
    adaptation in beef production to these weather changes.
  10: Climate change, particularly warming, negatively affects livestock production,
    especially in poor and tropical regions, impacting food security; temperature
    changes have a larger effect than rainfall changes; agricultural-dependent countries
    are more affected by warming than non-agricultural economies.
  11: Climate change is predicted to negatively impact beef production. The model
    suggests damage estimates even when accounting for adaptation, though the absence
    of adaptation should be considered with reference to the country-level unit of
    observation.
Methodology:
  2: Re-examines the relationship between weather changes and global livestock production.
  3: Panel data analysis using group fixed effect to account for omitted variables.
    Employs national livestock production and local weather fluctuations from 187
    countries. Accounts for omitted variable bias and allows for substantial variation
    through which to identify the effects of short-term weather shocks on livestock
    production.
  4: The analysis uses country-level cattle production data, weather data, and climate
    change prediction data to examine climate impacts on cattle production using a
    reduced-form framework.
  6: Error-corrected ACCESS SSP3.70, errors adjusted for spatial (1000 km) and serial
    (3-years) correlation. Using live animal indicator (cattle stock) as outcome variable.
  7: Panel data analysis with country fixed effects and region-specific trends, standard
    errors adjusted for spatial and serial correlation. The sample period is 1961-2017.
  8: "Regression analysis with country fixed effects and region-specific trends. Standard\
    \ errors adjusted for spatial (1,000km) and serial (3-years) correlation. Different\
    \ model specifications are tested for robustness, including excluding outlier\
    \ countries, excluding Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), using only SSA data, and using\
    \ a balanced panel. Sample period is 1961\u20132017."
  9: The analysis uses a panel data econometric model with fixed effects and region-specific
    trends, examining the period from 1961 to 2017, and considers temperature and
    precipitation data to estimate their impact on cereal production.
  10: Panel data analysis from 1961 to 2017 examining the impact of weather fluctuations
    on global livestock production; uses long differences and panel estimates to analyze
    the impacts of weather variation on beef production.
  11: Panel data model is used, but does not account for adaptation to gradual changes
    in climate. Long differences method was also used to account for adaptation, but
    did not dampen the damage estimate from the model. The paper applies econometric
    techniques to understand the interaction between weather factors and livestock
    production.
More Notes:
  3: The methodology does not account for adaptation or inter-seasonal changes in
    weather, so the results should be seen as ''middle-of-the-road'' estimates. Adaptation
    often occurs at a smaller spatial unit (farm or household level) rather than national
    level.
  4: No relevant information
  6: Figures in bracket are percentage changes from historical figures.
  7: The quadratic term of temperature is significant across all specifications, indicating
    a potential nonlinear relationship between temperature and beef production.
  8: The paper investigates the channel through which weather changes affect beef
    production by analyzing the impact of temperature and precipitation on crop production.
    Results suggest that the negative impact of temperature on crop production may
    affect beef production through reduced availability of feed for cattle.
  10: The study acknowledges limitations related to the panel data method not accounting
    for inter-annual farmer tradeoffs and potentially capturing short-run inventory
    changes rather than long-run climate change impacts.
  11: The model does not account for heterogeneity in several channels through which
    climate change affects animals productivity. The model's limitations include the
    complexity of real-world agricultural processes.
