Drivers of Risk:
  1: Annual weather fluctuations
  2: The analysis focuses on changes in temperature and precipitation as drivers impacting
    livestock production.
  3: Temperature changes, rainfall fluctuations
  4: Changes in climatic patterns affect livestock directly by altering reproduction
    processes, feed conversion ratio, and health via the emergence of new diseases.
    Indirect effects include climate impacts on the availability of water, the access
    to and quality of feed, as well as the likelihood of morbidity when disease does
    occur.
  5: "Annual average temperature (in \xB0C) and yearly total precipitation (in mm/year)."
  6: The primary drivers of risk are changes in average temperature and total precipitation,
    as projected under the SSP3.70 climate scenario.
  7: The drivers of risk considered are temperature (in degrees Celsius) and precipitation
    (in mm units per year).
  8: Temperature and precipitation
  9: Temperature and precipitation (and their squared terms) are the drivers of risk
    examined.
  10: Temperature changes (tropical and poor countries are specifically mentioned),
    precipitation changes.
  11: Temperature and precipitation changes.
  12: This page provides references to studies examining drivers of risk, but does
    not contribute any new analysis of drivers of risk itself.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Global livestock production
  2: The paper re-examines the relationship between weather changes and global livestock
    production, specifically focusing on productivity loss in beef production.
  3: Livestock production
  4: Country-level cattle average production (tonnes).
  5: Impact of weather changes on beef production (log of beef production in tonnes).
  6: The paper evaluates changes in average temperature, total precipitation, and
    log animal production (tonnes) across different regions of the world.
  7: The paper evaluates the impact of temperature and precipitation changes on beef
    production.
  8: Beef production
  9: This page evaluates the impact of weather fluctuations on cereal production,
    measured in yield (ton/ha) and production (kg).
  10: Impacts of weather variation and climate change on beef production (in logs).
  11: Aggregate impact on beef production (in logs).
  12: This page provides references to studies evaluating various climate-related
    outcomes, but does not contribute any new evaluation overview itself.
Highlights:
  2: No adaptation beyond historical levels could lead to a 20% reduction in animal
    output by mid-century and an additional 40% by the end of the century due to climate
    change.
  3: Temperature changes have a robust negative effect on global livestock production,
    while rainfall fluctuations have a positive impact. The effect of temperature
    is more concentrated in hot, poor, and agricultural-dependent countries.  Benefits
    of rainfall moderate temperature-caused adverse effects in tropical regions, but
    aggravate adverse effects in temperate regions.
  5: Weather variation does not Granger-cause beef production, but the reverse is
    not the case.
  6: Temperature increases are projected across all regions under the SSP3.70 scenario.
    Changes in temperature have a negative and statistically significant relationship
    with beef production. The impact of temperature on animal production is more significant
    in tropical and poorer regions.
  7: Temperature increases are more severe in hot, poor, and agriculture-dependent
    countries. Precipitation has a positive effect on beef production in tropical,
    poor, and agriculture-dependent countries, while it has a harmful effect in temperate
    economies. The quadratic term of temperature is significant across all specifications,
    indicating a potential nonlinear relationship between temperature and beef production.
  8: Weather fluctuations influence beef output by affecting crop production through
    changes in the quantity and quality of feed available for cattle. There is a negative
    impact of temperature on cereal yields and production, especially in hot countries.
    There is a positive relationship between precipitation and crop outcomes.
  9: The impact of temperature and precipitation varies depending on the region (aggregate,
    tropical, poor, agriculture-dependent). Adaptation isn't apparent using country-level
    data.
  10: Global warming plays a more significant role than rainfall changes in determining
    livestock output in the longer term. Poor and agricultural-dependent countries
    located in the tropics are severely affected by warming. Agriculture-dependent
    countries are more affected by warming than non-agricultural economies.
  11: Presents spatial distribution of predicted climate change aggregate impact on
    beef production.
Methodology:
  1: Ecological Economics journal; data will be made available on request.
  2: The study uses an econometric strategy with country-level panel data to address
    the shortcomings of integrated assessment models and cross-sectional methods.
  4: "Reduced-form framework to analyze the general pass-through effect of annual\
    \ weather fluctuations on global livestock production. Uses historical weather\
    \ data from the University of Delaware and climate change projection data from\
    \ the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS-ESM1.5).\
    \ Examines medium-term (average over 2041\u20132060) and long-run (average over\
    \ 2081\u20132100) impacts of climate on cattle production."
  5: Panel data model at country/year level with country fixed effects and region-specific
    trends. Spatial and serial correlation in standard errors accounted for using
    the approach described in Hsiang (2010). Panel Granger causality Wald test is
    conducted.
  6: The analysis uses error-corrected ACCESS SSP3.70 climate model projections to
    predict changes in temperature, precipitation, and animal production. The results
    are adjusted for spatial (1000 km) and serial (3-years) correlation.
  7: The analysis uses panel data from 157 countries over the period 1961-2017. The
    regressions include country fixed effects and region-specific trends, with standard
    errors adjusted for spatial and serial correlation. The analysis includes both
    aggregate estimates and estimates for heterogeneous parts based on classifications
    such as tropical/temperate, rich/poor, and agriculture-dependent/not agriculture-dependent.
  8: "Estimates are from separate regressions with country fixed effects and region-specific\
    \ trends, adjusting standard errors for spatial (1,000km) and serial (3-years)\
    \ correlation. Sample period is 1961\u20132017."
  9: The analysis uses panel data models with country fixed effects and region-specific
    trends, covering the period 1961-2017. Standard errors are adjusted for spatial
    and serial correlation. The analysis also uses projected climate data from the
    ACCESS-ESM1.5 global climate model.
  10: Panel data analysis from 1961 to 2017. Long differences (15-year, 10-year, 20-year,
    29-year) analysis. Projections based on ACCESS-ESM1.5 model under SSP3-7.0 scenario
    relative to a 1981-2010 baseline, climate change projections out to 2041-2060
    and 2081-2100.
  11: Panel data model (but does not account for adaptation). Long differences method
    was used, but did not dampen damage estimates. Employs econometric techniques
    to understand the interaction between weather factors and livestock production.
  12: This page lists references to studies using various methodologies for climate
    impact assessment, but does not describe any methodology directly used in the
    paper itself.

  7: A country is defined as tropical if its median temperature is above the global
    median; otherwise, it is temperate. A country is rich if it is higher income or
    upper-middle income by World Bank classification, else it is poor. A country is
    agriculture-dependent if it has above median share of GDP in agriculture in 2000.

    production.
  10: The study acknowledges limitations of the panel data method in accounting for
    inter-annual farmer tradeoffs and the potential for picking up short-run inventory
    changes rather than long-run climate change effects. Study assumes climate will
    continue to affect livestock production.
  11: Absence of adaptation should be considered with reference to country-level observation.

Quantitative material:
  2: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature will lead to a 9.7% reduction in global beef\
    \ production on average; a marginal increase in annual precipitation would lead\
    \ to a 2.1% increase in beef production in tropical countries but a 1.9% decrease\
    \ in temperate ones."
  3: Climate change will reduce animal output by a further 20% in the mid-century
    and an additional 40% by the end of the century.
  4: "Uses the \u2018\u2018middle-of-the-road\u2019\u2019 scenario (SSP3-7.0) of the\
    \ ACCESS-ESM1.5 model to construct country-year panel for average temperature\
    \ and total precipitation from 1970 to 2100."
  5: "The model predicts a 2.2\xB0C rise in global temperature in the mid-future (2041-2060).\
    \ Global warming is predicted to double the mid-future change by the end of the\
    \ century (2061-2100)."
  6: "The table provides mean, min, max, and standard deviation for historical data\
    \ (1961-2017) and predicted medium-term (2041-2060) and long-term (2061-2100)\
    \ changes for temperature, precipitation, and log animal production. Percentage\
    \ changes from historical figures are included in parentheses for the predicted\
    \ changes. A 1\xB0C increase in temperature leads to a 9.7% reduction in beef\
    \ production. A 1\xB0C increase in temperature will result in about a 20% fall\
    \ in cattle production in tropical countries. A 1\xB0C increase in temperature\
    \ will reduce animal production by 27% in poor countries and 4% in rich ones."
  7: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature has a four times larger adverse effect in agricultural\
    \ economies than in non-agricultural ones. A 1 mm increase in annual precipitation\
    \ would lead to a 2.1% increase in beef production in tropical countries and a\
    \ 1.9% decline in beef production in temperate regions. An extra mm of annual\
    \ precipitation would generate a 3% improvement in beef production in agriculture-dependent\
    \ countries."
  8: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature is associated with a 3.7% drop in cereal yields.\
    \ A 1\xB0C higher temperature is associated with a 7.6% drop in global cereal\
    \ production. A marginal increase in annual rainfall is associated with a 1.5%\
    \ increase in global cereal yield. In tropical countries, a similar increase in\
    \ annual precipitation will result in a 2.8% rise in cereal yield."
  9: The table provides quantitative estimates of the impact of temperature and precipitation
    on cereal yield and production, with standard errors and significance levels.
    For example, a 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature is associated with a -0.0372
    ton/ha change in aggregate cereal yield [p < 0.001].
  10: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature will lead to a 9.7% reduction in beef production\
    \ on average, with most of this effect centered in tropical countries. Poorer\
    \ countries would also experience a 27% reduction as opposed to 4% in countries\
    \ with higher income levels. An additional mm increase in annual precipitation\
    \ would lead to a 2.1% increase in production in tropical countries but a 1.9%\
    \ decrease in temperate ones. Predicted loss in global beef production due to\
    \ climate change in 2060 ranges from 11% (in temperate regions) to 36% (in tropical\
    \ areas)."
  11: "Maps represent aggregate (temperature + precipitation) impacts (as log changes)\
    \ from ACCESS-ESM1.5 for (a) mid-term climate change (2041-2060) and (b) long-run\
    \ climate change (2081-2100) under SSP3-7.0 scenario. Changes are relative to\
    \ a 1981\u20132010 baseline."
