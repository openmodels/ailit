Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change due to global warming impacting tropical cyclones (TCs), Baiu,
    precipitation, and seasonal storms.
  3: Climate change effects on tropical cyclones (TCs), precipitation (Baiu-related),
    river and coastal floods (storm surges, storm waves) are identified as drivers
    of risk.
  7: Climate change impacts on tropical cyclone (TC) wind and rainfall patterns.
  10: Extreme rainfall events, particularly quasi-stationary, band-shaped precipitating
    systems (senjo-kousuitai), heavy rainfall due to organized mesoscale convective
    systems (MCSs), tropical cyclones and stationary fronts, and climate change induced
    increases in water vapor content and atmospheric energy.
  11: Increased rainfall intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall events due to
    climate change.
  12: Changes in annual maximum 24-hour rainfall and river discharge due to climate
    change (specifically, a 4-degree temperature rise scenario); extreme rainfall
    events.
  16: Climate change leading to increased storm surge risk, including insufficient
    knowledge of TC systems.
  18: Climate change impacts, specifically coastal hazards in Osaka Bay, Japan.
Highlights:
  1: Projected future changes in precipitation, river flooding, and coastal hazards,
    and their associated economic impacts in Japan and East Asia are the focus of
    the reviewed assessments.
  3: The TOUGOU program is highlighted as the only Japanese program supporting active
    development of a GCM, providing global projections for CMIP6, and bridging the
    gap between seamless projections and impact assessments.
  7: Rainfall in northern Japan is projected to increase under a warmer climate condition.
  10: Future warmer climate conditions are attributed to (1) decreases in the temperature
    lapse rate and (2) increases in atmospheric water vapor and atmospheric energy,
    leading to the formation of more precipitation under the PGW conditions.
  11: Future rainfall and river discharge are projected to increase significantly
    in three highly urbanized river basins in Japan (Arakawa, Shonai, and Yodo Rivers).
    Extreme rainfall biases in climate models may depend on river basin size and regional
    climate.
  12: Future climate scenarios (4-degree temperature rise) lead to significant increases
    in both rainfall and river discharge, increasing the risk of extreme flood events
    and associated economic damages.
  16: Risk and uncertainty premiums are not negligible in size and occur unevenly
    among areas where there is risk of flood damage. Risk and uncertainty premiums
    cannot be ignored when evaluating the economic value of a policy that mitigates
    storm surge flood risk under ambiguity.
  18: Bias correction in climate projections is essential for adaptation planning,
    and the interaction of different natural hazards can lead to compound events whose
    combined impacts are important to assess.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis is based on local-scale and large-ensemble numerical experiments
    to project long-term changes in natural hazards in Japan and East Asia.
  3: "The TOUGOU program integrates global projections to regional impact assessments\
    \ using ensemble and downscaling methods. TOUGOU-D utilizes climate projections\
    \ from Themes A\u2013C as well as CMIP5/6 projections."
  7: PGW (pseudo-global warming) experiments are conducted to project the influences
    of global warming on TC hazards in northern Japan, focusing on rainfall increases
    and wind speed changes. High-resolution simulations (1km) are used to investigate
    TC-related rainfall, projecting changes in the frequency of strong and weak rainfall
    events. Analysis uses the d4PDF dataset as initial and boundary conditions.
  10: Statistical analysis of precipitating systems, radar and rain-gauge precipitation
    data, automatic MCS detection algorithms, pseudo-global warming (PGW) experiments,
    dynamical downscaling experiments, and multi-model approaches using the d4PDF
    dataset (downscaled to 20 km).
  11: Analysis using d4PDF climate projection dataset, hydrological models, statistical
    tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), and comparison with observational data (APHRODITE,
    RAR). Applicable to assessing future changes in rainfall and river discharge in
    Japan.
  12: Uses d4PDF (Database for Policy Decision-making for Future climate change) to
    derive flood risk curves for historic and future ensemble experiments; calculates
    exceedance probabilities for flood damage.
  16: A Global Stochastic Tropical Cyclone Model was used to generate storm surge
    simulations. A web-based survey was conducted to assess willingness to pay for
    eliminating storm surge risk and ambiguity. A Limited Degree of Confidence (LDC)
    model was used to estimate preferences on risk and ambiguity. The economic value
    of a policy mitigating storm surge risk by raising a dike by 1 m was calculated
    using the estimated LDC model.
  18: The paper discusses the use of d4PDF and PGW experiments for assessing climate
    change impacts. A combination of the two approaches are important for conducting
    impact assessment of extreme events.
More Notes:
  1: The paper is a review of climate change impact assessments from a collaborative
    research program in Japan.
  7: The study focuses on the regional impacts of climate change on TC hazards in
    northern Japan, with a specific focus on rainfall and wind patterns. The impact
    on forest in Hokkaido from TC-induced winds is also noted to decrease.
  10: The d4PDF dataset is used to detect future changes in the frequency of the largest
    class of floods and resulting flood damages; however, the reliability of the results
    depends on the reproducibility of extreme rainfall against historical events.
  11: The study focuses on hydrological impacts (rainfall and river discharge) and
    doesn't directly assess macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  12: The study uses the Yodo River basin in Japan as a case study, so the findings
    are most directly applicable to that region, but the methodology could be adapted
    for other river basins; the histogram of exceedance probability shows a long tail,
    indicating that extreme rainfall events have a disproportionate impact on flood
    risk.
  16: The study focuses on Osaka Bay in Japan as a case study.
  18: The study focuses on a case study in Osaka Bay, Japan, and assesses the economic
    impact of coastal hazards and a dike rise mitigation policy.

  10: "Hourly extreme rainfall intensity is ~3% \xB0C\u207B\xB9 in the present climate\
    \ and is anticipated to rise to ~3.5% \xB0C\u207B\xB9 under future climate conditions."
  11: "The 200-year annual maximum 24-h rainfall for the d4PDF future experiment is\
    \ 1.3\u20131.4 times larger than the historic experiment; the annual maximum river\
    \ discharge is 1.5\u20131.7 times larger. The 200-year annual maximum 24-h rainfall\
    \ for the d4PDF future experiment is equivalent to the 900-year rainfall in the\
    \ historic experiment."
  12: "The 200-year annual maximum 24-h rainfall for the d4PDF future experiment is\

    \ maximum river discharge for the d4PDF future experiment is 1.5\u20131.7 times\
    \ larger than the historic experiment; exceeding flood damage of 800 billion Japanese\
    \ yen has an exceedance probability that could be as high as 0.01."
