Drivers of Risk:
  3: Climate change impacts on agricultural production, including changes in precipitation
    and temperature.
  5: Climate change impacting Colombian agriculture, extreme weather events, pests
    and diseases
  6: Shifts in the geographic distribution and incidence of pests and diseases and
    extreme weather events, which are determinants of crop yields.
  7: Climate change impacting agricultural yields and sustainability.
  8: "Projected increases in annual mean temperature (2.5\xB0C by the 2050s) and precipitation\
    \ (2.5% by the 2050s) across Colombia, with regional variations. Increased temperature\
    \ is expected to be more severe below 1,000 m.a.s.l, and between 2,700 and 4,500\
    \ m.a.s.l; while precipitation changes are expected to be stronger between 2,200\
    \ and 4,000 m.a.s.l."
  10: Changes in phenology due to higher temperatures; Increased pest and disease
    prevalence; Flooding in coastal areas; Increased climate variability-related vulnerability
    in small producers; Progressive losses of crop and pasture suitability.
  11: Phonological alterations due to climate change impacting growing seasons; Climate
    variability impacting smallholders; Temperature increases impacting coffee production;
    Climate change impacting sugarcane production (lodging, yields).
  14: Climate change impacts on agriculture, especially affecting small producers.
  15: Changes in crop phenology in lowlands, changes and shifts in distribution of
    pests and diseases, changes in the climatic niche of coffee, possible decreases
    in sugarcane yields, high temperature stress, drought, effects of CO2 fertilization.
  20: "Projected climate changes by administrative departments and ecogeographic regions\
    \ in Colombia by 2050 (2040-2069): AMT1 change (\xBAC), MxAT2 change (\xBAC),\
    \ MnAT3 change (\xBAC), ATR4 change (%), MxAR5 change (%), MnAR6 change (%), PS7\
    \ change (%)"
  25: Projected changes in annual mean temperatures and annual total rainfall by the
    2050s under the SRES-A2 emission scenario.
Highlights:
  3: Climate change will likely impact 14% of national GDP corresponding to agriculture
    and 3.5 million people by 2050.
  5: Climate change will severely impact Colombian agriculture, posing a threat to
    the socio-economic system.
  7: Agriculture is a key sector for Colombia, with significant inequality in farm
    size, income, and yields. Sustainability is challenged by both commercial agriculture's
    environmental impacts and low-input smallholdings' limited yields.
  10: Climate change is expected to cause yield reductions and increased production
    costs in the Colombian agricultural sector, with specific crops like coffee, sugarcane,
    and others being particularly vulnerable to pests, diseases, and changing climatic
    conditions.
  11: Adaptation strategies in rice can be completely offset by agricultural yields
    and income increases by the 2030s. Sugarcane adaptation costs can be completely
    offset.
  15: Governmental support to research and creation of an agricultural insurance scheme
    is critical for adaptation in the agricultural sector. Data availability is critical
    to adaptation plans on a sector basis.
  20: Presents projected changes in temperature and rainfall across different regions
    of Colombia, with variations across departments. The table highlights the spatial
    heterogeneity of climate change impacts within the country. For example, the Guaviare
    department is projected to experience a significant increase in rainfall (75.4%),
    while some regions might see decreases.
Methodology:
  5: "Analysis of climate change impacts on Colombian agriculture using 17 global\
    \ circulation models (GCMs) for the SRES-A2 emission scenario (\u201Cbusiness\
    \ as usual\u201D) and the 2050s time frame"
  6: Literature and statistical data review, use of the first communication to the
    UNFCCC as a baseline, analysis of climate model data, analysis of climatic changes
    and their distribution within cropped surfaces as derived from the latest census,
    analyzing the impacts and proposing major adaptation strategies for the sector,
    whilst at the same time assessing the possible political constraints that the
    sector could face when seeking adaptation to climate change.
  11: "Analysis based on work of CIAT (for rice) and EMBRAPA (for maize, soybean,\
    \ common beans, cassava, and sugarcane) and Cenica\xF1a (for sugarcane). Time\
    \ horizon up to 2050s for sector-based adaptation."
  14: Comprehensive and holistic sector-based and regional assessments (including
    economic, biophysical and social aspects) are needed to determine both negative
    impacts and future possible opportunities.
  15: Numerical (although limited) analysis and a qualitative assessment of impacts
    and adaptation options.
  20: No relevant information
  25: Projections performed using the SRES-A2 emission scenario and averaging results
    of 17 GCMs.
More Notes:
  3: The paper emphasizes the need for adaptation measures and investments in data
    collection, impact assessments, research and development, and technology transfer.
  5: The analysis proposes adaptation measures including definition of key financial
    flows and stakeholders.
  10: The paper suggests that adaptation measures like varietal changes and altered
    planting dates should be tested in the Colombian context.
  11: Personal communications cited from Tapasco J. (2011), Assad E. (2011), and Palmer
    N. (2010).
  14: Highlights the need for prioritization of geographic areas and crops to obtain
    national and international funds for adaptation.
  15: The study highlights the need for comprehensive, sector-based and regional assessments
    of climate change impacts, particularly in agriculture in Colombia. There's a
    significant lack of data and appropriate modeling approaches for assessing impacts
    and adaptation costs. The research acknowledges funding from UNDP and the Colombian
    Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MADR).

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Climate change in Colombia will likely impact 14% of national GDP corresponding
    to agriculture.
  5: GDP effects on agriculture (10-14% of national GDP)
  6: Short-term vulnerability and maintaining and enhancing food-security.
  7: Agricultural GDP.

    prevalence and loss of crop climatic niches, especially for very niche-specific

    costs of adaptation strategies like building irrigation systems and establishing
    a rice genetic improvement and research center.

Quantitative material:
  3: Climate change in Colombia will likely impact 3.5 million people and 14% of national
    GDP corresponding to agriculture by 2050. 80% of crops would be impacted in more
    than 60% of their current areas of cultivation.
  5: Agriculture contributes 10-14% to Colombian GDP; 40% of total Colombian exports
    are from agricultural trade; 3.7 million people employed in agriculture
  7: In 2007, 17% of the total value of crop production corresponded to coffee production
    (1,451 million USD of 1994). Fruit production is 13% of the total value. Cattle
    slaughter in 2007 was 2.4 million head. Milk production ranges were 20 to 23 million
    liters, with an average production rate of 4.5 liters/animal/day.
  8: "Average estimated increase in annual mean temperature to the 2050s is 2.5\xBA\
    C, with a maximum of 2.7\xBAC in the Arauca department and a minimum of 2\xBA\
    C in Choc\xF3 and Nari\xF1o. Precipitation is projected to increase 2.5% by the\
    \ 2050s, with a minimum change of -1.4% in Cesar and a maximum of 5.6% in Huila."
  10: "Yield loss is predicted in the Cauca river basin if temperatures rise above\
    \ +1\xB0C."
  11: Rice adaptation strategies completely offset by increases in agricultural yields
    and income by 2030s.

    more than 2.5 million US dollars; MAVDT funds that have already been allocated
    to the IDEAM (~1.5 million USD).
