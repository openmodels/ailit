Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sustained hotter, drier conditions associated with reductions in forage quality;
    Reduced nitrogen availability in grasslands due to higher temperatures.
  2: Climate change, specifically geographic patterns in mean annual temperature (MAT)
    and mean annual precipitation (MAP) and interannual variation in climate.
  5: Future climate change (higher temperatures, changes in precipitation), potentially
    compounded by decreased forage quality due to higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
  6: Warming leading to reduced forage quality, affecting cattle weight gain.
Highlights:
  1: Long-term effects of higher temperatures likely to accrue over time as nitrogen
    availability in grasslands is reduced and forage quality declines, potentially
    leading to significant economic consequences for the US cattle industry.
  5: Climate change is likely to cause greater nutritional stress for bison and reduce
    their body size. Geographic patterns of bison mass show a relatively greater sensitivity
    to temperature than precipitation.
  6: Warming could cost US cattle producers around $1 billion per degree Celsius of
    warming.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of over a quarter million bison weights distributed across 22 US herds;
    Analysis with respect to differences in geographic patterns of climate and interannual
    variation in climate.
  2: 'A two-stage analysis is used: First, mean body mass of each sex standardized
    for age is determined for each herd. Second, relationships between climate and
    standardized body mass are tested using a linear regression model with age and
    site as factors (MASS~AGEzSITE).'
  5: Analysis of bison mass with age in relation to June precipitation and mean annual
    temperature, using smoothing splines. Critical climate period analysis using regression
    models. Geographic patterns are used as an imperfect guide.
  6: Transferring observed reductions in weight gain for bison to cattle to estimate
    economic costs of warming.
More Notes:
  1: The paper suggests that relationships observed for bison may be general for cattle,
    providing a basis for estimating economic consequences. The study emphasizes the
    importance of long-term monitoring of forage quality and grazer performance to
    better understand climate change effects.
  5: The study focuses on bison mass as a proxy for economic returns for bison producers.
    The paper acknowledges that the ecological effects of reduced weight gain may
    affect the ecological roles of bison in native grasslands.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: "Potential economic consequences of higher temperatures due to decreased weight\
    \ gain in US cattle, estimated at US$1B per 1\xB0C increase in temperature."
  2: Bison body mass as a measure of grazer performance.
  5: Potential negative effect on economic returns for bison producers due to reduced
    weight gain affecting bison fecundity and body size.
  6: Economic costs to US cattle producers due to warming.
Quantitative material:
  1: "US$1B per 1\xB0C increase in temperature (estimated economic consequences)."
  2: Data on over 290,000 body masses of bison from 22 US herds are used. Latitudes,
    longitudes, elevation, mean annual precipitation, mean June precipitation, mean
    annual temperature, and years of measurement are provided for each herd.
  5: Table 2 provides regression estimates for the effect of precipitation during
    specific periods (days 170-214, 170-189) on bison weight (intercept and coefficient
    estimates with p-values) for All-Female, Calf-Female, and Calf-Male bison populations.
    Figure 3 shows age-specific sensitivity of bison mass to climate variables. Table
    2 notes no significant predictors of male bison weight when using all age classes
    (0.5-6.5y).
  6: "Costs to US cattle producers of 1\xB0C warming could be in the range of US$1\
    \ billion either through direct reductions in weight gain or costs of dietary\
    \ supplement."
