Drivers of Risk:
  2: Sea-level rise (SLR) is the primary driver of risk, posing a threat to low-lying
    atoll nations.
  3: Sea-level rise (SLR) poses long-term threats to small islands, particularly atolls,
    making them vulnerable.
  4: Sea Level Rise (SLR), extreme inundation (flood) events, coastal erosion.
  10: Sea level rise (SLR) is the primary driver of risk.
  14: Sea Level Rise (SLR), pluvial flooding
  16: Sea-level rise (SLR) affecting agriculture and rural islands, potentially leading
    to abandonment.
  17: Sea-level rise (SLR), flooding, and erosion are key drivers impacting island
    nations.
  18: Sea-level rise, disasters (e.g., tsunamis)
  20: Rising sea levels; Climate impacts; Rising sea temperatures and coral bleaching
    and mortality; Pressure on emissions from flights.
Highlights:
  2: Atoll nations can persist and prosper for many centuries with the adaptation
    approach of land advance/raising, contrary to assumptions of forced migration
    and national abandonment.
  3: Adaptation to SLR is needed, but the appropriate measures differ based on island
    type (e.g., sea-walls and beach nourishment for larger, higher islands vs. different
    approaches for smaller atolls). Planned displacement may be seen as a last resort
    for atolls when in-situ adaptations fail. Migration can be a means to adapt or
    a failure to adapt, and can be a positive anticipatory response if implemented
    appropriately.
  4: Land raising and advance are presented as potentially transformative adaptation
    approaches for SLR in atoll nations.
  10: A tourist island has a rapid payback time of around five years, at a timescale
    where the impacts of climate change are not considered a risk. Hence, there is
    high economic productivity and appropriate cost-benefit conditions, space to build
    and engineering design possibilities, but low social acceptability for hard structural
    solutions unless they are aesthetically pleasing. This means it is financially
    viable for land raising/advance to take place.
  14: Raising of land is the only way to guarantee that coastal flooding will not
    occur with SLR.
  16: Strategic island raising can provide an adaptive approach for urban areas that
    can continue far into the future even with large amounts of SLR.
  17: Island advance and raise greatly increases adaptation options in an acceptable
    way to Maldivian society; large port facilities and energy infrastructure are
    economically affordable to protect/enhance.
  18: Adaptation is possible across land use types consistent with existing development
    trends and driven by choices made by the Maldivian population.
  20: Adaptation needs to be suitable for the present and over longer timescales,
    when conditions may be quite different; Land advance has great potential to be
    integrated into coastal management.
Methodology:
  2: The paper proposes structural adaptation using land claim and island raising
    within an adaptation pathway approach, particularly using the case study of the
    Maldives.
  3: The paper classifies islands based on morphology, slope, and elevation to assess
    vulnerability to SLR.
  4: The paper uses a case study of the Maldives to explore land raising and advance
    as adaptation strategies. It assesses the background of environmental change in
    atoll environments and develops a methodology to adapt to SLR using land raising
    and advance. The analysis aims to determine how these methods can provide a transformative
    adaptation approach for SLR for atoll nations over multiple centuries.
  10: Analyzes adaptation pathways for mitigation and non-mitigation SLR scenarios
    per island, then combines islands for a multi-island adaptation pathway, considering
    migration. Engineering design conditions, space and material availability, cost-benefit
    conditions, social acceptability, and economic productivity are considered for
    different land use types. Options were considered by island function.
  14: Overtopping and inundation analysis, comparing land height to SLR.
  16: Demonstrates that if adaptation aligns with present and future development,
    and builds flexibility, it can provide development opportunities and improved
    livelihoods.
  18: Illustrative technical approach of land advance/raising and adaptation pathways.
More Notes:
  2: The paper emphasizes that while land advance and island raising provide technical
    solutions for SLR, they must address various policy, human, physical, engineering,
    and economic/financial challenges.
  3: The paper discusses the debate around climate change-related migration as adaptation
    versus a failure to adapt, and the need for orderly governance and community-level
    considerations in relocation efforts. It also emphasizes that migration can be
    an anticipation of change that reduces exposure to a hazard.
  4: The paper acknowledges the need for significant social, political, and cultural
    debate, including ethical dimensions, to determine adaptation futures, but primarily
    focuses on technical and environmental perspectives.
  10: 'The analysis focuses on land advance and raising, plus the associated movement
    of people. It categorizes islands by land use (agricultural, energy, heritage,
    natural, port, rural, tourism, and urban) and groups them into four classes for
    analysis: agriculture/rural housing; port/energy; urban development; and tourism.'
  14: Adaptation measures should fit with wider development and government vision.
    Island topography and associated infrastructure could be designed to roll back
    with SLR. Population movement between islands is a key part of the adaptation
    strategy.
  16: The advance and raise approach provides an opportunity to reverse the apparent
    adaptation lock-in of simply reinforcing and raising sea walls, and create land
    as needed for development.
  17: Adaptation responses on tourist islands are often driven by extremes and erosion
    (short timescales) rather than SLR (long timescales).
  18: The paper acknowledges financial and human costs, such as socio-political integration,
    associated with adaptation strategies like population consolidation.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: The paper does not provide specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, but it
    discusses the concept of land advance and island raising as a technical solution
    to address the challenges posed by sea level rise.
  3: No relevant information
  4: This paper focuses on adaptation strategies to rising sea levels in atoll nations,
    particularly land raising and advance (strategic land claim), which could have
    implications for long-term economic viability and population displacement, but
    does not explicitly discuss macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. The paper implies
    that without adaptation, there will be negative impacts, but the specific measures
    are not quantified.
  10: Cost-benefit conditions of adaptation options are considered for different island
    land use types.
  14: Major responses to flooding include accommodation of more frequent flooding
    and forward planning like raising land/buildings, with the potential for island
    abandonment and reconfiguration as an ultimate outcome.
  16: Improved livelihoods due to adaptation aligning with present and future development,
    including building new islands and raising them to cope with sea-level rise (SLR).
  17: Maintaining two of three urban islands provides a solution to sustain the capital,
    if well connected with food supplies and desalinated water.
  18: Reduced risk, prevention of potential future loss and damage, and alignment
    with development plans through population consolidation in response to tsunami
    threats.
  20: "Higher adaptation costs for SIDS need to be continually recognized; Detrimental\
    \ effect if adaptation is not fully financed; Growing and urbanizing populations\
    \ allow for concentration of wealth, and thus pooling of finance to adapt to SLR;\
    \ Rising sea temperatures and coral bleaching and mortality will likely profoundly\
    \ change the Maldives\u2019 tourist industry; Pressure on emissions from flights\
    \ could reduce European tourists, but allow increased tourism from south Asia\
    \ as flight distances are shorter."
