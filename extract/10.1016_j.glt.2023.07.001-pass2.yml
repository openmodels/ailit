Drivers of Risk:
  1: Fossil fuel combustion leading to air pollution and climate change.
  3: Climate change impacts child health outcomes which can lead to human capital
    losses and broader societal and economic losses.
  6: fossil fuel-driven climate change and air pollution
Highlights:
  1: Fossil fuel combustion can significantly impact the lifelong health and human
    capital for generations.
  3: Climate change and environmental exposures are linked with a wide array of health
    effects on children which can contribute to human capital losses.
  6: health effects from early-life exposure may result in more substantial socio-economic
    losses
Methodology:
  3: No relevant information
  6: collaborative and interdisciplinary efforts to monetize child health and human
    capital impacts
More Notes:
  1: The paper calls for a more holistic assessment of the full range of impacts borne
    by children, including direct damages to children's health, losses of human capital,
    and associated economic costs. The paper aims to summarize the current evidence
    on the health effects of fossil fuel-driven air pollution and climate change on
    children and the consequent effect on human capital stemming from these early
    health damages.
  3: Environmental exposures due to fossil fuel combustion and climate change have
    direct negative impacts on child health and subsequent societal impacts.
  6: the need for a holistic assessment of the impact of fossil fuel combustion on
    children and the potential for economic losses due to reduced human capital
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Loss of human capital due to the health impacts of fossil fuel combustion on
    children. Associated economic costs stemming from damaged early-life health and
    losses of human capital in adulthood.
  3: No relevant information
  6: macroeconomic losses due to children's potential productivity loss
