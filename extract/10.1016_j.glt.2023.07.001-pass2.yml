Drivers of Risk:
  1: Fossil fuel-driven climate change and air pollution are impacting children's
    health.
  5: Early-life exposure to high temperatures and air pollutants, climate-related
    undernutrition and infections, and adverse birth outcomes (PTB/LBW).
Evaluation overview:
  1: The paper provides an overview of the impact of fossil fuel combustion on children's
    health and the associated losses of human capital.
  5: The paper discusses the impacts of climate change and air pollution on cognitive
    and non-cognitive abilities, which in turn affect individual earnings and economic
    productivity.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change and air pollution deteriorate children's health and affect human
    capital in adulthood.
  5: Climate change and air pollution can negatively impact cognitive development
    (IQ, academic achievement) and non-cognitive skills (personality traits, behavioral
    tendencies), potentially leading to reduced earnings and economic productivity
    in adulthood. PTB/LBW induced by air pollution and climate change could further
    lead to specific behavior tendencies in children.
Methodology:
  1: The paper summarizes current evidence on the health effects of fossil fuel-driven
    air pollution and climate change on children.
  5: The paper reviews existing literature and meta-analyses to assess the impact
    of climate change and air pollution on cognitive and non-cognitive skills.
More Notes:
  1: The paper calls for a more holistic assessment of the full range of impacts borne
    by children, including direct damages to health, losses of human capital, and
    associated economic costs and emphasizes cross-disciplinary collaboration to enrich
    our understanding of the multifaceted impacts of fossil fuel combustion.
  5: The paper calls for a holistic assessment of the direct and indirect impacts
    of health damages on children due to climate change and air pollution, including
    the long-term effects on human capital and associated economic costs.
Quantitative material:
  1: Air pollution leads to approximately 4.2 million premature deaths each year,
    and climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths every year from 2030
    to 2050.
  5: Mentions meta-analyses showing 11-12 point lower IQ scores for children born
    preterm and 10 point lower scores for children born with low birth weight.
