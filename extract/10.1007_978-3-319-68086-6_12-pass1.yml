Drivers of Risk:
  2: Human interventions and natural processes dynamically couple, impacting barrier
    island evolution and response to climate change.
  6: Sea-level rise and coastal erosion rates increase the risk to barrier islands.
  7: Climate change impacts on barrier islands (unspecified on this page), divestment
    from developed barrier islands turning into abandonment, boom-bust cycles in tourist-driven
    economies
  15: Shoreline management decisions in one place becoming an indirect function of
    uncoordinated actions elsewhere, potential changes to policy regarding nourishment
    subsidy and insurance coverage
  17: Sea-level rise (SLR); agents being non-believers in projected environmental
    change.
  18: Sea level rise, storm surge magnitude.
  19: Percent increase in mean storm surge magnitude and sea-level rise (worst-case
    and calm scenarios).
  20: Sea-level rise (worst-case and calm scenarios); Belief in 'science-based' forecasts;
    Percent increase in federal nourishment subsidy.
  21: Sea-level rise rates, storm surge size, rate of nourishment subsidy, and belief
    in forward looking models.
  22: Sea-level rise, storm events (overwash, storm surge), shoreline erosion.
  24: Rising sea level and large storm events.
Highlights:
  2: "Developed barrier islands must be treated as coupled human\u2013natural systems\
    \ to understand future responses to climate change."
  6: Economic markets may anticipate the increasingly precarious nature of barrier-island
    real estate as sea level rises, and perhaps drive divestment from barrier-island
    property.
  7: Traditional approaches treat human activity or physical change as unidirectional
    cause-and-effect; coupled dynamics of change along developed coastlines are feedback-driven;
    beach nourishment is a specific linking mechanism.
  15: A more holistic management approach is necessary to avoid rapid depletion of
    coastal sediment resources and severe economic disparities in defense capacity.
  17: Property damage is larger when model predictions do not inform beliefs, and
    the magnitude of this difference rises as the rate of sea-level rise increases;
    non-believers are more likely to own property during periods of high risk, leading
    to an equity issue where broader society funds repairs for damages they wouldn't
    have suffered.
  18: Time to abandonment is reduced as storm magnitude increases. The amount of damage
    that occurs prior to abandonment increases significantly with larger increases
    in mean storm surge magnitude. Cumulative damage prior to abandonment constitutes
    the majority of total damage.
  19: A subsidy for beach nourishment costs increases both the time to abandonment
    and the amount of damage prior to abandonment.
  20: Increasing the weight agents give to forecasts of barrier evolution causes both
    time to abandonment and damage to decrease when the rate of sea-level rise is
    high.
  21: Physical forcing (storm surge size), policy forcing (rate of nourishment subsidy),
    and psychological forcing (belief in forward looking models) can play an important
    role in systemic instability under conditions representative of developed barriers
    today.
  22: Developed coastlines and coastal resort economies may experience boom and bust
    cycles beyond the time of initial abandonment of barrier islands due to natural
    physical processes and the interactions of economic agents and policy agents.
  24: Mitigating against coastal hazards by filtering out the cumulative impacts of
    small-scale storms can lead to large storm events becoming even more destructive.
    Even moderate amounts of development are associated with reduced erosion
Methodology:
  6: The paper uses the concept of 'dynamical attractors' to describe the possible
    evolutionary states of developed coastal systems.
  7: Conceptual frameworks for spatio-temporal patterns in tourist-driven economies;
    Coupled human-natural systems dynamics analysis
  15: Optimization functions as the primary coupling mechanism between the system's
    physical and economic components
  17: Coupled model investigating factors influencing coastal homeowners' decisions
    to abandon coastal property; the model begins with an initial physical barrier-island
    state similar to barriers found along the North Carolina Outer Banks, USA.
  18: 'Simulations of coastal inhabitants abandoning property on a barrier island
    are run under different sea-level-rise and storm surge magnitude scenarios. '
  19: The model examines the role that policy plays in abandonment by introducing
    a subsidy for beach nourishment costs.
  20: Simulations are run to examine how individual perceptions of environmental change
    might impact abandonment; Simulations examine the impact of increasing the weight
    agents give to forecasts of barrier evolution.
  21: Extension of a coupled model by McNamara and Keeler (2013).
  22: Coupled a three-dimensional numerical model of barrier-island evolution with
    an agent-based model of tourism development to simulate long-term dynamics of
    developed coastlines and coastal-resort economies over centuries.
  24: The work uses a model to simulate the development of barrier islands.
More Notes:
  2: High-density development on U.S. barrier islands is unlikely to persist without
    major technological advancements or geotechnical transformations.
  6: The study focuses on human-landscape coupling in developed coastal barrier islands.
  17: The model uses agents to represent coastal homeowners; the model extends previous
    work on developed barrier abandonment.
  18: The study focuses on a barrier island and might not be directly scalable to
    a national level assessment without considering the specifics of the coastlines
    of a country.
  19: The study raises equity issues related to the national populace funding beach
    nourishment subsidies and emergency repairs through taxes.
  20: The study focuses on abandonment and damage related to barrier islands in response
    to sea-level rise and subsidies; The model uses 'agents' with a 'belief' in forecasts.
  21: The model focuses on the timing of systemic instability under conditions representative
    of developed barriers.
  22: The model includes heterogeneous economic agents (developers, hotel owners,
    and tourists) interacting in a simulated market for tourism real-estate, and a
    policy agent that decides when to implement beach and dune nourishment based on
    cost-benefit analysis.
  24: The model showed good agreement when tested against the historical development
    of Ocean City, Maryland.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  6: Property value and investment in mitigation practices are macroeconomic outcomes
    of interest, specifically on barrier islands.
  7: Economic drivers intensifying coastal development; Costs/benefits of coastal
    adaptation (abandonment or reinforcement of economic drivers)
  15: Unequal access to nourishment sand as a resource, advantages for towns with
    high property values in withstanding coastal hazard, property-value loss, severe
    economic disparities in defense capacity across coastal towns
  17: Disaster assistance represents income transfers from taxpayers as a whole to
    affected populations; broader society is funding repairs for damages that the
    average citizen would not have suffered.

  19: Total damage sustained before abandonment of a hypothetical barrier island.
  20: Total damage sustained as a function of percent increase in federal nourishment
    subsidy.

    respectively.
