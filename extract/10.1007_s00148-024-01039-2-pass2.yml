  6: 'The study uses multi-model ensemble climate projections from CMIP6 for three
    emissions scenarios: SSP1-1.9, SSP2-4.5, and a high emissions scenario.  This

Highlights:
  1: Global warming has significantly increased obesity rates in countries located
    in temperate zones, while only causing a reduction in a small number of tropical
    countries; long-term adaptation may not significantly mitigate the impact of global
    warming on obesity in temperate zones; heterogeneity in the impact across countries
    with varying income levels, age structures, and education levels.
  3: Global warming significantly increased obesity rates in countries within temperate
    zones while reducing obesity only in tropical countries; Adaptation cannot significantly
    offset the impact of warming on obesity; warming initially increases and then
    reduces obesity, although the turning point is lower
  4: The study is the first to directly examine the overall impact of warming on obesity
    based on long-run global data and to evaluate the potential of long-run adaptation
    in offsetting this impact.
  6: No relevant information
  8: The study aims to capture the causal effect of temperature on obesity using temperature
    fluctuations. It also explores how the effect of warming on obesity varies across
    countries with different incomes.
  10: Warming has a significantly positive impact on the adult obesity rate.
  11: "Obesity rate increases with temperature for most countries, but decreases above\
    \ 27\xB0C. Income (GDP) has a limited moderating effect."
  12: Warming has a statistically significant impact on obesity rates, with a non-linear
    relationship indicated by the figures, where GDP moderates the effects of temperature
    on obesity.
  13: The estimated effect of temperature on obesity is robust to various controls
    and weighting schemes, suggesting a connection between temperature and obesity
    rates; within-country population migration has a minor effect on the estimated
    effect.
  15: The impact of warming on obesity is higher in poorer countries, countries with
    older populations, and countries with higher average schooling of adults.
  16: The impact of warming on obesity varies depending on GDP per capita, age, and
    education levels.
  17: Males are more exposed to the impact of global warming on obesity. The impact
    on Africa and the Americas is smaller, the impact on the Eastern Mediterranean
    and Asia is larger.
  19: "The analysis suggests a positive relationship between temperature and obesity\
    \ rates. The marginal effect on obesity rates tends to increase as temperature\
    \ increases, especially in bins greater than 18\xB0C. The marginal effect on obesity\
    \ rate increases as the seasonal mean temperature rises."
  20: Warming of high-temperature seasons increases obesity rates. The effect of temperature
    variation on obesity first increases with temperature variation and then levels
    off at very high variation.
  21: Positive temperature shocks initially enhance and then reduce the adult obesity
    rate, consistent with the effect pattern of annual mean temperature found in the
    baseline model.
  23: Global warming might increase obesity through a decrease in calorie expenditure
    due to reduced outdoor sports and working hours, higher temperatures, and persistent
    consumption preferences not aligning with declining energy demand.
  25: Higher temperatures initially increase and then reduce obesity in both long-run
    and short-run models. The estimated threshold temperatures differ significantly
    between the long-run and short-run models.
  26: Global warming is likely to increase obesity in most countries according to
    the short-run model, with a significant impact on the number of obese individuals
    and associated economic losses. The long-run model predicts that global warming
    is likely to increase obesity in most countries from temperate zones while reducing
    obesity in most countries from subtropical and tropical zones.
  27: Global warming may increase obesity in temperate zones and decrease obesity
    in subtropical and tropical zones.
  28: Long-term adaptation may not significantly reduce the impact of global warming
    on obesity. Global warming may increase obesity in temperate zones, while reducing
    it in subtropical and tropical zones due to income reduction.
  29: Global warming significantly increased obesity in most countries, with the exception
    of a small number of tropical countries; long-term adaptation may not significantly
    mitigate the impact of global warming on obesity in temperate zones; substantial
    heterogeneity in the impact across countries in various regions and with differing
    income levels, age structures, and education levels.
Methodology:
  1: Analyzing year-to-year temperature fluctuations in 152 countries from 1975 to
    2016; comparing a baseline model with a long-difference model.
  3: 'Employed four alternative model settings: third-degree temperature polynomial;
    temperature bins; seasonal mean temperature, temperature variation; temperature
    shocks. Also estimated a ''long-difference'' model that relies on long-term temperature
    trends. Examined six potential channels: income, food prices, minimum calorie
    requirements, working hours, physical activity, and consumption preferences.'
  4: The study examines the overall impact of warming on obesity based on long-run
    global data and evaluates the potential of long-run adaptation in offsetting this
    impact.
  5: The study uses country-level climate measures calculated as the population-weighted
    average across all climate grids within each country, derived from the LandScan
    Program.
  6: The study utilizes multi-model ensemble climate projections from the Coupled
    Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) for three emissions scenarios. Annual
    mean temperature across 152 sampled countries averaged from 1975 to 2016 is displayed.
  7: The analysis uses a fixed effects panel model, comparing the same country over
    time to estimate the causal effect of warming on obesity, applicable from 2016
    to 2050.
  8: The analysis uses country fixed effects to account for cross-country temperature
    differences. The baseline model employs a J-degree temperature polynomial to capture
    the nonlinear effect of temperature. The authors also investigate the interaction
    between income and temperature.
  10: Compares a short-run model (year-to-year temperature variations) with a long-run
    model (30-year temperature trends) to infer the effect of adaptation; uses a long
    difference approach by comparing 30-year periods (e.g., 1945-1975 vs 1946-1976);
    uses year fixed effects instead of country-specific year trends; estimates models
    over the period 1975-2016 for 152 countries, based on temperature data from 1945-2016;
    uses first to fifth degree temperature polynomials as explanatory variables.
  11: Regression models using first- to fifth-degree temperature polynomials and interaction
    with log GDP per capita to estimate response functions of obesity to temperature;
    standard errors clustered at the country level.
  12: The analysis uses a third-degree model to estimate the marginal effect of warming
    on obesity, accounting for the interaction effect of income in some models. Robustness
    checks were performed by excluding control variables, fixed effects, and population
    weights.
  13: Regression analysis with various control variables (carbon emissions, crude
    death rate, year fixed effects) and population weighting schemes (2016 population,
    population in each year) to assess the robustness of the estimated impact of temperature
    on obesity. Standard errors clustered at the country level.
  15: 'A linear regression model (equation 8) is used to assess the heterogeneity
    effect of global warming on obesity across models. The model includes country
    fixed effects, country-specific time trends, and the square of country-specific
    time trends. Three moderating variables are examined: Log GDP per capita, average
    adult age, and average adult years of schooling, using 1975 values to avoid the
    ''bad control problem''.'
  17: "Excludes one geographic region at a time from the sample to assess the significance\
    \ of each geographic region in the estimated impact of warming on obesity. Constructs\
    \ 3\xB0C temperature bins from country-level monthly minimum and maximum temperatures.\
    \ Regression model used with country fixed effects and controls."
  19: The analysis uses models (9) and (10) to estimate the impact of temperature
    bins and seasonal temperature on obesity. Standard errors are clustered at the
    country level. Seasons are defined based on ranking of monthly mean temperatures.
  20: Uses country fixed effects to eliminate the mean temperature of the country.
    Employs regression analysis with fixed effects to assess the relationship between
    temperature, temperature variation, and obesity rates. Averages monthly temperature
    data and uses third-degree polynomial regression to measure obesity as a function
    of temperature variation.
  21: The analysis uses a modified baseline model (Eq. 13) to estimate the impact
    of positive temperature shocks on obesity, considering months where temperature
    exceeds one standard deviation above the long-run average. A third-degree polynomial
    of the temperature shock is used.
  23: The analysis relies on a review of existing literature to infer channels through
    which global warming impacts obesity and uses a modified model to estimate effects
    on dietary and exercise patterns.
  25: A long-run model (6) based on 30-year temperature trends using a third-degree
    temperature polynomial as the primary explanatory variable to estimate the impact
    of warming on obesity.
  26: The analysis combines estimated country-level marginal effects of temperature
    on obesity with projected temperature changes for each country from 2016 to 2050
    under different emissions scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP1-1.9, SSP5-8.5). The marginal
    effects are estimated using a third-degree version of model (1). The results are
    applicable for the period between 2016 and 2050.
  27: Combine estimated marginal effects of temperature on obesity with projected
    warming scenarios to predict impact on obesity in 2050. Compare short-run and
    long-run models to infer the effect of adaptation.
  28: The authors compare short-run and long-run models to estimate the impact of
    global warming on obesity, considering adaptation, income variation, and cumulative
    effects over time.
  29: The study estimates the causal effect of global warming on obesity using plausibly
    exogenous year-to-year temperature fluctuations; long-term adaptation assessed
    by comparing baseline model with a long-difference model.
More Notes:
  6: The inclusion of Fig. 2, displaying the distribution of annual mean temperature
    across countries, suggests the study will likely use these temperature distributions
    as a basis for analyzing climate change impacts.
  10: The effect of adaptation is inferred by comparing estimates from the two models
    (short-run and long-run), but this difference is not solely driven by adaptation.
  11: Analysis limited for countries with mean temperatures below zero due to insufficient
    variation in the data.
  12: The effect of temperature on obesity is moderating by income (GDP).
  13: Examines the heterogeneity of the impact concerning income level, age structure,
    education level, gender, and geographic region (though details are on subsequent
    pages).
  19: "The sixth temperature bin (12-15 \xB0C) was excluded due to perfect collinearity.\
    \ Estimating effects of seasons in a single model could mitigate biases from temperature\
    \ correlations across seasons."
  20: The seasonal model provides more detailed information than an annual average
    temperature model, but does not capture non-linear effects observed in other analyses.
  21: The temperature variation is defined according to Eq. (11), and the positive
    temperature shock is based on the number of months in each year with temperatures
    exceeding one standard deviation above the long-run average for that month.
  23: The flowchart provides a visual summary of the factors influencing obesity,
    emphasizing the interplay between economic, physical, and environmental factors.
  25: The response function has been normalized to start from zero, comparable to
    the short-run marginal effect presented in panel B of Fig. 4.
  27: The analysis distinguishes between short-run and long-run marginal effects to
    account for potential adaptation. The maps visually depict the projected changes,
    with panel C showing the difference between long-run and short-run impacts.
  28: The study suggests a more active role for the public sector in addressing the
    effect of global warming on obesity.
  29: The study is limited by the lack of long-term sub-country data on obesity and
    the lack of annual data on the share of the population with different BMI scales.

    \ on obesity, expressed as yit = \u2211Jj=1 \u03B1j temjit + Xit \u03B4 + \u03C4\
    i + yearit + year2it + \u03B5it, where yit is the adult obesity rate, and the\

  11: "Warming has a significantly positive impact on the adult obesity rate for most\
    \ countries, except for the 21 tropical countries with an annual mean temperature\
    \ above 27 \u25E6C, where it has a reducing effect."
  12: "A 1\xB0C increase in temperature can lead to a \u22120.56 to 1.87 percentage\
    \ point change in obesity rates across countries, with a population-weighted average\
    \ of 1.06 percentage points. This translates to 79.7 million more obese adults\
    \ worldwide based on a 2016 population of 7.49 billion."
  13: Presents robustness checks for baseline estimates of the relationship between
    temperature and obesity rates under different control variables and weighting
    conditions; provides graphs showing trends and confidence intervals.
  15: A marginal effect of 1.13 percentage points of warming on obesity. A one-unit
    increase in log GDP per capita would reduce the impact of warming on obesity by
    0.202 percentage points. A 1-year increase in the adult average age would raise
    the impact of warming on obesity by 0.026 percentage points. A 1-year increase
    in the average schooling of adults would increase the impact of warming on obesity
    by 0.019 percentage points.
  16: The marginal effect of warming on male obesity is roughly one-third larger than
    that on female obesity.
  17: Global warming increase the female obesity rate by 0.81 percentage points.
  19: The analysis quantifies the marginal effect of temperature bins and seasonal
    mean temperature on obesity rates in percentage points (ppt).
  20: Uses a third-degree polynomial of temperature variation in a regression model
    (equation 12) to estimate the effect of temperature variation on obesity.
  21: "The response function of obesity to temperature variation is shown in Figure\
    \ 9, with obesity rate (%) ranging from 0 to 30 as temperature variation (\xB0\
    C) ranges from 1 to 13. The response function of obesity to positive temperature\
    \ shocks is presented in Figure 10."
  23: No specific quantitative information is provided on this page.
  25: "Long-run model estimates a threshold temperature of 18.5\u25E6C, while the\
    \ short-run model estimates a threshold temperature of 27.3\u25E6C for the effect\
    \ of temperature on obesity rates."
  26: Short-run model predicts global warming will increase obesity in the majority
    of countries. 77 countries are expected to experience an impact greater than 1
    percentage point, 41 exceeding 2 percentage points, and 7 surpassing 3 percentage
    points. Population-weighted average impact of warming on obesity across 152 sample
    countries is 1.2 percentage points. Global warming is estimated to increase the
    number of obese individuals worldwide by 89.9 million from 2016 to 2050, resulting
    in an economic loss of approximately $276.6 billion.
  27: Global warming from 2016 to 2050 would result in 76.8 million more obese individuals
    in temperate zones and 106.9 million fewer obese individuals in subtropical and
    tropical zones.
  29: "A 1\xB0C rise in annual mean temperature would increase the number of obese\
    \ adults worldwide by 12.3%."
