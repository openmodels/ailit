  5: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global warming (measured via CO2 emissions)
  3: Global warming, violence, climate change, inflation, soaring food prices, lower-income
    families
  5: Climate Change (CLC); Food price (FP); Food supply (FS); Real per capita income
    (Y); Population growth rate (PG)
  7: Climate change (CLC), which measures the impact of CO2 emissions levels. Climate
    unpredictability and inadequate technology in developing countries significantly
    affect food security. Population growth (PG) limits food availability.
  8: CO2 emissions per capita, population growth rate, food imports, arable land
  9: Previous Malnutrition (LNprevmalnutri), Price Growth (LNPG), Inflation (LNINF),
    Net Foreign Import (LNFIMPORT), Net Foreign Direct Investment (LNFDI), CO2 Emissions
    per Capita (LNCO2EMISSIONSPERCAP), Land area used for agriculture (LNAL)
  10: CO2 emissions (as a proxy for global warming), FDI inflows, income inequality.
  12: LNPG (likely agricultural production growth), LNINF (likely inflation), LNGDPPCAPITA
    (GDP per capita), LNFIMPORT (likely food import), LNFDIdoesnot (foreign direct
    investment), LNCO2_EMISSIONS__PER_CAP (CO2 emissions per capita), LNAL (likely
    agricultural land area)
  13: Climate change (CO2 emissions), global warming, rainfall variability, temperature
    extremes, global commodity prices shifts
Highlights:
  1: The study finds evidence of a positive long-term correlation between food insecurity
    and climate change in West Africa.
  3: Food insecurity and undernourishment are increasing in Africa and West Africa.
    West Africa experiences declining per capita food production.
  7: "All variables show positive skewness, suggesting right\u2011skewed distributions\
    \ with longer tails on the right side. This indicates a tendency towards higher\
    \ values in each variable."
  8: A 1% change in CO2 emissions leads to an 18.3% change in the prevalence of malnutrition.
    Increase in population growth and food imports lead to higher malnutrition rates,
    while an increase in arable land decreases malnutrition rates.
  9: LNPG does not Granger-cause LNPREVMALNUTRI (p=0.0071), indicating a causal relationship.
    LNGDPPCAPITA and LNPREVMALNUTRI do not Granger-cause each other.
  10: Increased CO2 emissions correlate with higher per capita GDP and higher incidence
    of malnutrition in West Africa. There is a negative long-run relationship between
    food insecurity and FDI inflows in GLM estimates for West Africa.
  12: The table highlights causal relationships (or lack thereof) between different
    macroeconomic variables and a variable likely related to malnutrition prevention
    (LNPREVMALNUTRI). The results indicate unidirectional causality in some cases,
    independence in others.
  13: Climate change impacts food insecurity in West Africa; Climate-smart agriculture
    programs, climate-resilient infrastructure, and agricultural research are crucial
    for adaptation
Methodology:
  1: Kaoco-integration, FMOLS, and GLM techniques are used to analyze panel data from
    2000 to 2020 for West African countries.
  3: Utilizes secondary data from 2000 to 2020 and employs panel FMOLS and GLM econometric
    techniques to analyse food security in West Africa, examining per capita GDP,
    population growth, and level of food importation. Employs livelihood-based and
    scenario-based methodologies to identify location-specific adaptation methods.
  5: The demand, supply, and utility theories are combined and modified using a Cobb-Douglas
    function to model food utility, with climate change as the input factor and food
    security as the output. The model is applicable to evaluating the relationship
    between dependent variables and other factors.
  7: "The Jarque\u2011Bera test used to assess the normality of distributions yielded\
    \ probability values greater than 0.05 for all variables, supporting accepting\
    \ the Ho of normally distributed data."
  8: Panel FMOLS (Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares) estimation is used to determine
    the relationship between the prevalence of malnutrition and the listed variables.
    The Kao co-integration test is done to test for co-integration.
  9: Panel Granger causality test and generalised linear model (GLM) are used.
  10: Panel unit root tests (LLC, IPS, FISHER-ADF, PP-FISHER) and Kao co-integration
    test. The analysis is for West Africa. Also uses GLM estimates.
  12: Panel Granger causality tests are used to examine the relationships between
    the variables. Wald test and heteroskedasticity tests are also conducted. Results
    applicable when the observations in the panel are independent of each other.

More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the agricultural sector's vulnerability to climate change
    and its impact on food insecurity. It recommends climate-smart agricultural practices,
    carbon emission reduction, increased agricultural investment, improved incomes,
    enhanced farming techniques, climate change mitigation programs, agricultural
    research investment, and economic diversification.
  3: The study aims to inform policies and interventions to help farmers adapt to
    the challenges of global warming and food insecurity.
  7: The study focuses on West African countries and uses food prices as a proxy for
    inflation due to its correlation with food insecurity.
  8: The paper focuses on the prevalence of malnutrition as the primary outcome, which
    is influenced by macroeconomic and environmental variables. It does not directly
    address macroeconomic or fiscal risks of climate change or the costs/benefits
    of adaptation, but it explores how CO2 emissions, arable land, and other variables
    are statistically associated with malnutrition.
  9: The paper uses panel data analysis to explore relationships between various macroeconomic
    and agricultural variables. Several tests were conducted to assess data stationarity,
    including VIF, correlation analysis and multiple unit root tests
  10: The results regarding GDP per capita and food insecurity contradict some previous
    findings in Africa, highlighting regional specificities. Misappropriation of FDI
    may be a factor in the unexpected negative relationship between FDI and food security.
  12: The variables are log-transformed (LN). The paper checks if residual is normally
    distributed. The Wald test results show that each variable in the model is significant
    at 0.05.
  13: Study acknowledges limitations including data unavailability, generalization
    constraints, and exclusion of socioeconomic factors
