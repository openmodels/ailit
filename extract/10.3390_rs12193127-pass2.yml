Drivers of Risk:
  1: "The 1997/98 El Ni\xF1o and positive Indian Ocean Dipole event; anomalous wind\
    \ stress curl over the central Indian Ocean; shift of upwelling system."
  4: "The southward migration of the South Tropical Convergence Zone (SZCZ) during\
    \ the 1997/98 El Ni\xF1o event, attributed to anomalous Wind Stress Curl (WSC)\
    \ over the central Indian Ocean, is identified as a driver of changes in Chl-a\
    \ concentrations and productivity."
  10: "Super El Ni\xF1o and positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD+) events, specifically\
    \ the 1997/98 event, causing a reorganization of surface circulation in the Western\
    \ Indian Ocean (WIO) and displacement of the NKBs upwelling."
Highlights:
  1: "A major ecosystem shift in coastal East African waters occurred during the 1997/98\
    \ Super El Ni\xF1o, leading to a southward migration of the Somali\u2013Zanzibar\
    \ confluence zone and a reorganization of surface currents."
  10: "The 1997/98 El Ni\xF1o and IOD+ event caused an unprecedented displacement\
    \ of the NKBs upwelling from Kenyan national waters to south of Zanzibar Island\
    \ in Tanzanian national waters."
Methodology:
  1: "Combination of remote sensing and ocean modelling to show how a stable seasonal\
    \ upwelling off the Kenyan coast shifted into the territorial waters of neighboring\
    \ Tanzania during the 1997/98 El Ni\xF1o. Comparison with other super El-Ni\xF1\
    o events of 1972,73, 1982\u201383 and 2015\u201316."
  4: The study uses satellite altimetry data from AVISO/CMEMS to derive Sea Surface
    Height Anomalies (SSHA), geostrophic velocities, and Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE).
    It also uses satellite-derived Chl-a concentration data from Ocean-Colour Climate-Change
    Initiative (OC-CCI) and CZCS Level 3 products. Climatological monthly means are
    calculated for EKE and Chl-a concentrations.
  10: "Combination of marine technologies to investigate the effects of the 1997/98\
    \ super El Ni\xF1o and IOD+ event on the NKB upwelling. The model's ability to\
    \ simulate the 1997/98 event allows for investigation of events before satellite\
    \ observation."
More Notes:
  1: Satellite observations may assist fisheries management bodies to anticipate low
    productivity periods.
  10: "The study acknowledges the difficulty in separating the effects of widespread\
    \ warming due to El Ni\xF1o from the temporary 'regime swing' of the upwelling\
    \ cell. It also discusses conflicting reports on the impact on fisheries, with\
    \ some studies showing declines and others showing stability in certain areas."

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: "Negative impacts on local fish stocks in Kenya, affecting fishers\u2019 livelihoods\
    \ and food security; temporary increase in pelagic fishery species\u2019 productivity\
    \ in Tanzania; potentially negative economic impacts on fisheries management bodies."
  4: The study suggests that changes in chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a, index
    phytoplankton biomass) can be an indicator of productivity changes, with implications
    for regions south of Zanzibar Island and near Dar es Salaam.
  10: "Potential negative impact on local fish stocks at the North Kenyan Banks (NKBs)\
    \ due to reduced nutrients and phytoplankton biomass; potential increase in pelagic\
    \ fishery species\u2019 productivity near Zanzibar due to a short-lived upwelling\
    \ cell."
Quantitative material:
  1: Lowest observed chlorophyll-a over the North Kenya banks (Kenya), historical
    maximum off Dar Es Salaam (Tanzanian waters).
