Drivers of Risk:
  230: Global warming; Intense human mobility; Trading of agricultural goods; Pest
    invasions; Range expansion
  231: Biological invasions of insect pests, accelerated by global warming as well
    as increased human travelling and product trading worldwide
  234: Invasive fruit flies expanding their geographic distribution.
  244: Establishment of invasive fruit flies; Global climate change (leading to increased
    global average temperatures).
  245: "Climate change, specifically warming temperatures; Expansion of geographic\
    \ range of insect pests; Shift of species\u2019 geographic ranges; Increasing\
    \ number of arrivals of new pests; Dramatic increases of some insect pest populations."

  449: Mediterranean fruit fly outbreaks, biological and execution mistakes in eradication
    programs, public opposition to malathion spraying, failures to properly manage
    the pest (e.g., not recognizing overwintering, accidental release of fertile flies).
  492: No relevant information
  622: Biological incursion (banana fly Bactrocera musae) into a new region (Gazelle
    Peninsular)
Highlights:
  244: Establishment of invasive fruit flies can lead to significant revenue and job
    losses; Global climate change is unequivocal and leading to increasing temperatures.
  245: Climate change may lead to expansion of insect pest ranges, increased pest
    populations, and a resulting economic impact on crops. The complexity of interactions
    makes prediction of invasion patterns difficult, potentially leading to costly
    missteps in control efforts.

  449: Public concern over aerial malathion bait spraying was a major challenge in
    eradication programs. Early programs primarily focused on biological and economic
    problems, while later programs also addressed environmental, property rights,
    and human health concerns.
  492: No relevant information
  495: Bait station technology (PLMs) can be more cost-effective than foliar application
    for fruit fly control. Bait stations are also a more cost-effective way of managing
    C. capitata than mass trapping.
  611: Trapping is a fundamental component of pest risk management and protects a
    significant horticultural industry.
  622: Accurate diagnostics must be closely aligned with trapping programs; presence
    of cryptic complexes can confuse identification; mistakes can be made even in
    dedicated taxonomy labs.
Methodology:
  230: Historical perspectives; Detection and monitoring of invasion events; Methods
    and strategies to confront invasive fruit flies; Discussion regarding prospects
    for research and policy regarding fruit fly invasions
  245: Modeling techniques are employed to predict the potential distribution of invasive
    species.

  495: Compares the costs of different pest management strategies (application of
    GF-120 via protein-lure matrices (PLMs) versus foliar application; bait stations
    versus mass trapping). Applicable in commercial papaya orchards (Hawaii) and potentially
    European crops.
  622: Trapping network followed by lab identification; post-hoc assessment of daily
    data sheets to map spread; eventual investigation after reported fruit damage.
More Notes:
  234: Invasive fruit flies may have major effects on the ecology of native species,
    and eradication campaigns can lead to secondary pests and altered ecosystems.

  302: The data presented pertains to wild captures in traps and related statistics,
    which doesn't directly translate to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes of
    climate change or adaptation costs/benefits at a national level, and is therefore
    irrelevant to the purpose of the review.
  318: This page describes a methodology for tracking sterile fly recapture rates
    in pest control programs. It uses spatial analysis and mapping techniques to identify
    areas where control efforts are succeeding or failing, which is not directly relevant
    to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks of climate change and adaptation.
  435: This page primarily discusses the history of fruit fly infestations and control
    measures in the US and Mexico in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It does
    not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks of climate change or
    the costs/benefits of adaptation at a national level in a way that would be applicable
    to the prompt.
  449: The paper details the evolution of concerns from damage to car finishes to
    public health and environmental issues, highlighting the increasing complexity
    of eradication programs.
  492: This page describes bait stations used for fruit fly suppression in the USA-Mexico-Guatemala
    Moscamed Regional Program, which is an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) intervention.
    While pest management can have indirect economic benefits by protecting agricultural
    yields, the page itself does not provide any macroeconomic or macro-fiscal analysis,
    cost-benefit analysis, or national-level adaptation strategies. Therefore, it
    has no relevant information for this review.
  611: The Moscamed Regional Program illustrates a case where investment in pest control
    infrastructure protects a large agricultural sector.
