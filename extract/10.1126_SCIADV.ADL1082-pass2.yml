Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased extreme heat due to anthropogenic global warming is a key driver, particularly
    impacting tropical regions.
  2: Intensity of extreme heat waves (Tx5d), annual average temperature, and temperature
    variability
  3: Extreme heat (measured by Tx5d - the intensity of the hottest 5-day period),
    annual mean temperature, and daily-scale temperature variability.
  4: Anthropogenic increases in extreme heat (Tx5d), changes in average temperatures,
    heat waves
  5: Anthropogenic changes to extreme heat are identified as a primary driver of GDPpc
    changes across various regions.
  6: Anthropogenic changes to extreme heat intensity (specifically changes in Tx5d
    intensity, the hottest 5 days of the year); Increases in average temperatures;
    Increased temperature variability; Fossil fuel CO2 emissions
  7: Increased extreme heat intensity, anthropogenic climate change (leading to increased
    frequency and intensity of heat extremes), average temperatures, temperature variability.
  9: Extreme high temperatures (Tx5d), temperature variability (V), and annual mean
    temperature (T) are key drivers of risk. Anthropogenic warming's contribution
    to extreme temperatures is analyzed.
  10: Anthropogenic changes in Tx5d (a climate variable, presumably related to extreme
    temperature) are the driver of risk considered, with the impact measured as change
    in growth rate.
Highlights:
  1: The studies show a significant disparity in economic impacts due to extreme heat
    between the poorest and wealthiest regions globally.
  2: "Extreme heat significantly decreases economic growth in warm regions, weakly\
    \ affects growth in temperate regions, and increases growth in cold regions. The\
    \ annual mean temperature at which extreme heat becomes harmful is ~14\xB0C. Tropical\
    \ low-income regions suffer the most from increased extreme temperatures."
  3: Extreme heat has a distinct spatial pattern, causing large damages in low-latitude
    regions and transitioning to modest damages/benefits as latitude increases. The
    interaction between mean temperature and Tx5d is significant, meaning increases
    in mean temperatures are harmful in warmer locations, and this harm arises because
    of interactions between warmer mean temperatures and increased extreme heat intensity.
    Temperature variability has a strong negative effect on growth, even when controlling
    for extreme heat.
  5: Regions with lower income per capita experience greater relative damages from
    extreme heat, with some regions losing more than 6.7% of GDPpc annually.
  6: Poorer regions suffer most when extreme heat increases. Rich countries, large
    emitters of fossil fuel CO2, are primarily responsible for increases in global
    temperatures and associated heat extremes, and therefore the income losses suffered
    by individual regions. High-latitude regions have suffered losses by anthropogenic
    forced changes in extreme heat, contrary to the original expectation that they
    would benefit. Historical changes in average temperatures have caused greater
    losses than changes in extreme heat. Inequality of climate change extends to its
    causes and effects
  7: Increased extreme heat intensity significantly decreases economic growth in relatively
    warm tropical regions and weakly affects it in relatively cool midlatitude regions;
    climate change has amplified underlying inequality, disproportionately harming
    low-income, low-emitting regions, with major emitters shouldering primary responsibility
    for billions of dollars of losses in the tropics; the economic costs of temperature
    extremes are distinct from the costs of average temperatures and temperature variability;
    the true economic costs of temperature changes depend on which moment of the temperature
    distribution an analysis considers.
  9: The study finds that extreme heat has a statistically significant negative impact
    on economic growth. Anthropogenic warming is found to contribute to extreme temperatures,
    thereby affecting economic growth. Regions with modest annual cycles are also
    regions with high temperatures (i.e., the tropics), so the damages associated
    with both extremes and variability fall disproportionately on low-income tropical
    regions.
  10: The analysis produces a global sample of continuous GDPpc data at the regional
    level with an explicit treatment of parametric and residual uncertainty.
Methodology:
  1: The effect of extreme heat on economic growth is quantified using subnational
    economic data, extreme heat metrics, and an ensemble of climate models.
  2: Empirical model includes Tx5d, annual average temperature, their interaction,
    and temperature variability. Historical climate model simulations are used to
    assess the economic effects of anthropogenic changes in extreme heat intensity
    to date. Regression uncertainty is quantified via bootstrapping.
  3: Panel regression with fixed effects, interacting Tx5d with annual mean temperature.
    Likelihood ratio tests are used to compare models. Additional models include interactions
    with average income and the Palmer Drought Severity Index.
  5: The analysis uses distributed lag coefficients to model GDPpc growth changes
    due to heat intensity, bootstrapping for confidence intervals, and a Monte Carlo
    analysis to quantify uncertainty.
  6: Monte Carlo simulations are used to generate uncertainty ranges. Least-squares
    regression is used to determine the relationship between GDP and the regional-average
    effect of anthropogenic changes to extreme heat. The study focuses on the historical
    effects of extreme heat.
  7: Econometric analysis using subnational spatial scales to measure the effect of
    extreme heat on economic growth; extrapolation procedure assuming average temperature
    controls the marginal effect of extreme heat globally; focuses on the peak intensity
    of extreme heat.
  9: Panel regression with fixed effects is used to model economic growth. A distributed
    lag version of the regression equation is used to examine whether the effects
    of extreme temperatures persist over time. Bootstrap resampling is used to estimate
    sampling uncertainty. They are using CMIP6 climate data. The results are applicable
    to understanding the historical impact of extreme heat on economic growth at a
    regional level.
  10: A statistical model predicts regional GDPpc using country-level GDPpc and regional
    nightlights via ordinary least squares regression over the period 1992-2013. A
    Monte Carlo analysis (N=10,000) is used to propagate uncertainty. A 10-fold cross-validation
    analysis tests out-of-sample predictive power.
More Notes:
  2: Extrapolation to regions without economic data highlights the latitudinal structure
    of the effect of extreme heat.
  3: The authors suggest that current adaptations to extreme heat have not been successful
    in eliminating negative effects. The paper finds independent effects of average
    and extreme temperatures. The value of incorporating Tx5d relative to a model
    that only includes annual average temperature is supported by a likelihood ratio
    test (P < 0.0001).
  5: High-income countries see significant absolute losses, but less relative impact,
    while low-income regions face more substantial relative economic damage.
  6: The spatial pattern of damages is different from the original pattern of the
    marginal effect of extremes, as high-latitude regions that were initially expected
    to benefit have suffered losses. The damages calculation incorporates changes
    in mean temperatures along with extremes.
  7: "Analysis is limited by missing data in many of the world\u2019s poorest and\
    \ hottest regions, such as Africa; results should be viewed as conservative, as\
    \ incorporating additional periods of extreme heat would likely enhance the effect."
  9: The Tx5d metric (annual maximum of 5-day running means of daily max temperature)
    is chosen for its simplicity and geophysical meaning. The analysis incorporates
    heterogeneity in the response of regions to extreme heat by interacting Tx5d with
    annual average temperature.
  10: Uzbekistan and Kenya appear to be outliers, potentially due to errors in the
    country-level GDPpc data.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Cumulative global losses from anthropogenic extreme heat between 1992 and 2013
    are estimated to be between $5 trillion and $29.3 trillion.
  2: Economic growth (percentage points)
  3: Economic growth is affected by extreme heat, average temperatures, and temperature
    variability.
  4: Economic production, GDP per capita (GDPpc), income trajectory, income loss/gain
  5: Macroeconomic outcomes include GDP per capita (GDPpc) changes, with regional
    GDPpc used to assess economic impacts of extreme heat.
  6: Average annual change in regional GDP per capita; Cumulative change in regional
    GDP; Cumulative global GDP change
  7: Economic growth, specifically GDP effects at the country and subnational level.
  9: Economic growth (g) is the primary outcome variable, modeled as a function of
    temperature extremes, variability, and mean temperature.
  10: Regional GDPpc is the predictand of interest, used to calculate accumulated
    economic damages from warming. The effect of anthropogenic changes in extreme
    temperatures on GDPpc is calculated as the difference between observed and counterfactual
    GDPpc time series.
Quantitative material:
  1: Economic losses from extreme heat are estimated at 6.7% of GDP per capita per
    year for regions in the bottom income decile and 1.5% for regions in the top income
    decile.
  2: "An SD increase in Tx5d intensity depresses growth by 0.63 percentage points\
    \ in Brazil (average temperature 23.8\xB0C), and enhances growth by 0.62 percentage\
    \ points in Norway (average temperature 4\xB0C)."
  3: "Annual average temperatures explain ~40% of the variation in raw Tx5d values.\
    \ Annual average temperature anomalies explain less than 13% of the variation\
    \ in Tx5d anomalies. A negative effect of temperature variability (\u22122.01\
    \ percentage points per SD). Without extreme heat, variability effect is \u2212\
    2.21 percentage points per SD"
  5: Cumulative global losses due to extreme heat average more than $16 trillion in
    2013, with regional impacts varying significantly.
  6: "Fig. 4 shows average annual change in regional GDPpc due to anthropogenic changes\
    \ in Tx5d intensity over 1992\u20132013. Fig. 4 shows cumulative 1992\u20132013\
    \ change in regional GDP in 2010 U.S. dollars due to anthropogenic changes in\
    \ Tx5d intensity. Fig. 4 shows cumulative global GDP change due to anthropogenic\
    \ changes in extreme heat, with mean and uncertainty ranges. Also mentions 2 to\
    \ 4% GDPpc losses in tropical regions if average temperatures are held constant."
  7: Extreme heat intensity accounts for almost 10% of overall damages despite being
    based on <2% of days in the year, indicating that the hottest few days of the
    year have an outsize influence on the economic effects of warming.
  9: "The study estimates the change in economic growth (\u0394g) attributable to\
    \ anthropogenic changes in Tx5d."
  10: Country-level GDPpc explains 87% of the variation in regional GDPpc in their
    sample. The model including country-level GDPpc and regional nightlights has out-of-sample
    prediction errors of less than 7% of the average regional log GDPpc.
