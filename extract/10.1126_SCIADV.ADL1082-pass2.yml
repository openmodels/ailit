Drivers of Risk:
  1: Human-caused increases in heat waves, specifically the temperature of the hottest
    several days in each year (Tx5d).
  2: Extreme heat intensity (Tx5d) and annual average temperature.
  3: The drivers of risk examined are annual mean temperature, extreme heat (measured
    as the intensity of the hottest 5-day period - Tx5d), daily-scale temperature
    variability, and interactions between mean temperature and Tx5d. Drought and income
    are also considered as potential moderators.
  4: The drivers of risk include anthropogenic increases in extreme heat, specifically
    changes in the frequency and intensity of the hottest 5-day periods (Tx5d) influenced
    by anthropogenic warming.
  5: Anthropogenic changes in extreme heat (Tx5d).
  6: Anthropogenic changes in Tx5d intensity (intensity in the hottest 5 days of the
    year), changes in average temperatures and variability, fossil fuel CO2 emissions.
  7: Increased extreme heat intensity (specifically the temperature of the hottest
    5-day heat wave in each year (Tx5d)), anthropogenic climate change increasing
    the frequency and intensity of heat extremes, average temperatures, and temperature
    variability
  8: Extreme heat is identified as a risk factor impacting economic outcomes.
  9: Extreme high temperatures and temperature variability are identified as factors
    affecting economic growth.

Evaluation overview:
  1: Economic growth globally, particularly in poor tropical regions.
  2: Economic growth
  3: This study evaluates the impact of temperature (average, extreme, and variability)
    on growth, likely economic growth, though not explicitly stated on this page.
  4: The paper evaluates the economic impacts of anthropogenic extreme heat, focusing
    on how it affects economic production and income trajectories through changes
    in extreme heat.

    measures and early-warning capabilities in response to extreme heat events.

Highlights:
  1: Human-caused increases in heat waves have depressed economic output most in the
    poor tropical regions least culpable for warming. Global inequality is both a
    cause and consequence of the unequal burden of climate change.
  2: Extreme heat significantly decreases economic growth in warm regions, weakly
    affects growth in temperate regions, and increases growth in cold regions. Warm
    tropical regions both tend to have lower incomes and suffer the most from increased
    extreme temperatures.
  3: Extreme heat causes large damages in low-latitude regions and transitions to
    modest damages and lastly benefits as latitude increases. There are significant
    independent effects of both average and extreme temperatures. Increases in average
    temperatures have weakly positive effects in cold regions and increasingly harmful
    effects in warmer regions. Temperature variability has a strong negative effect
    on growth. The effect of temperature variability increases in magnitude when extreme
    heat is not explicitly considered.
  4: The paper highlights that anthropogenic warming has increased the frequency and
    intensity of extreme heat events, with tropical regions particularly vulnerable
    to losses due to stronger economic effects from extreme heat.
  5: Anthropogenic changes to extreme heat have primarily harmed tropical regions.
    Regions with lower income per capita experience greater relative damages from
    heat extremes.
  6: Poorer regions suffer most from extreme heat increases due to higher baseline
    temperatures and lower temperature variability. Rich, high-emitting countries
    are primarily responsible for increases in global temperatures and associated
    heat extremes, leading to income losses in other regions. Historical changes in
    average temperatures have caused uniform losses globally, with greater magnitudes
    than the losses from extreme heat.
  7: Increased extreme heat intensity significantly decreases economic growth in relatively
    warm tropical regions and weakly affects it in relatively cool midlatitude regions;
    anthropogenic climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of these
    economically consequential heat extremes; the effects of climate change on extreme
    heat have amplified underlying inequality, disproportionately harming low-income,
    low-emitting regions.
  8: Investments in heat resilience and early-warning systems, especially for the
    hottest days of the year, could provide significant economic benefits.
  10: The model explains 87% of variation in regional GDP per capita using country-level
    GDPpc and nightlights; this improves to ~90% when excluding outliers such as Uzbekistan
    and Kenya.

Methodology:
  1: Uses subnational economic data, extreme heat metrics, and an ensemble of climate
    models to quantify the effect of extreme heat intensity on economic growth globally.
    Empirically estimates the effect of extreme heat intensity on observed economic
    growth using data from a global sample of subnational regions.
  2: Empirical model includes Tx5d, annual average temperature, their interaction,
    and temperature variability. Historical climate model simulations are used to
    assess the economic effects of anthropogenic changes in extreme heat intensity.
    Regression uncertainty is quantified via bootstrapping.
  3: A fixed effects model is used, purging time-invariant regional characteristics.
    The study interacts Tx5d with annual mean temperature. The Palmer Drought Severity
    Index and average income are also used as interaction terms. Likelihood ratio
    tests are used to compare models. The analysis controls for mean temperatures.
  4: The analysis uses a distributed lag model and CMIP6 climate models to estimate
    the effects of anthropogenic changes in extreme heat and the persistence of these
    effects over time.
  5: The study uses a combination of climate model simulations and econometric modeling
    to estimate the impact of extreme heat on GDPpc. It addresses missing GDPpc data
    by downscaling country-level GDPpc to regional levels using nighttime luminosity.
    A Monte Carlo analysis is performed to quantify uncertainty. The analysis covers
    the period 1992-2013.
  6: Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 runs) to estimate cumulative global GDP change.
    Least-squares regression to assess the relationship between GDPpc percentile and
    the effect of anthropogenic changes to extreme heat, considering fossil fuel CO2
    emissions anomaly.
  7: Econometric analysis at the subnational spatial scale, focusing on the peak intensity
    of extreme heat (Tx5d). Extrapolation procedure assumes the underlying average
    temperature controls the marginal effect of extreme heat globally. The effects
    of temperature variability are recovered after 4 years.
  8: The analysis includes estimating the effects of extreme heat on economic growth
    using empirical regression methods at the subnational level, climate model simulations
    for counterfactual heat series, and a Monte Carlo approach for uncertainty.
  9: The analysis uses a panel regression with fixed effects to model economic growth
    as a function of extreme temperatures, including interactions with variables like
    mean temperature and temperature variability, with a bootstrap resampling procedure
    to estimate sampling uncertainty.
  10: The analysis uses a statistical model predicting regional GDP per capita based
    on country-level GDPpc and regional nightlights, validated using a 10-fold cross-validation
    and Monte Carlo analysis.

More Notes:
  1: The paper aims to quantify the global macroeconomic effects of extreme heat and
    close a gap in climate-economic research, particularly concerning high-resolution
    economic and disaster data in the world's poorest and warmest regions. It uses
    the temperature of the hottest 5-day period in each year (Tx5d) as a primary metric
    for extreme heat.
  2: "The effects of extreme heat must be inferred for regions for which economic\
    \ data is unavailable. The sample on which the estimate is based covers ~66% of\
    \ the world\u2019s population."
  3: The study suggests that the effect of extreme heat is primarily moderated by
    temperature rather than income or drought. The study emphasizes that current adaptations
    have not been successful in eliminating the negative effects of extreme heat.
  6: The paper focuses on the historical effects of extreme heat and quantifies the
    effects of increased intensity in the hottest 5 days of the year to inform adaptation
    strategies. Damages from changes in average temperatures and variability are also
    calculated for comparison.
  7: "The analysis focuses on extreme heat intensity (Tx5d) as opposed to extreme\
    \ heat frequency or duration. The results are viewed as conservative. The analysis\
    \ is limited by missing data in many of the world\u2019s poorest and hottest regions.\
    \ Damages from anthropogenic changes in variability are spatially complex and\
    \ smaller than the damages from extreme or average temperatures. When combined,\
    \ damages associated with all three variables appear primarily driven by changes\
    \ in average temperatures."
  10: The study provides a global sample of continuous GDP per capita data at a regional
    level, including treatment of parametric and residual uncertainty.

Quantitative material:
  1: "Cumulative 1992\u20132013 losses from anthropogenic extreme heat likely fall\
    \ between $5 trillion and $29.3 trillion globally. Losses amount to 6.7% of Gross\
    \ Domestic Product per capita per year for regions in the bottom income decile,\
    \ but only 1.5% for regions in the top income decile."
  2: "In Brazil (23.8\xB0C average), an SD increase in Tx5d intensity depresses growth\
    \ by 0.63 percentage points. In Norway (4\xB0C average), an additional SD in Tx5d\
    \ intensity enhances growth by 0.62 p.p."
  3: "Annual average temperatures explain ~40% of the variation in raw Tx5d values.\
    \ When expressed as deviations from regional means, annual average temperature\
    \ anomalies explain less than 13% of the variation in Tx5d anomalies. A model\
    \ including Tx5d has greater explanatory power than a model that does not (P <\
    \ 0.0001). Variability has a negative effect on growth (-2.01 p.p. per SD) in\
    \ a model that includes Tx5d, which increases to \u22122.21 p.p. per SD when Tx5d\
    \ terms are removed."
  4: "The analysis provides quantitative data showing regional Tx5d values have increased\
    \ by an average of 0.77\xB0C globally over 1992\u20132013, with probabilities\
    \ of extreme Tx5d values rising by 13 percentage points across regions, and even\
    \ more in South America, Africa, and the Middle East."
  5: Cumulative global losses due to extreme heat average more than $16 trillion in
    2013. Some tropical countries have GDPpc >5% per year lower due to extreme heat.
    High-latitude nations have depressed GDPpc by ~1% per year. Regions in the lowest
    income decile experienced losses of 6.7% of GDPpc per year, compared to 1.5% in
    the top income decile.
  6: "Average annual change in regional GDPpc due to anthropogenic changes in Tx5d\
    \ intensity over 1992\u20132013; Cumulative 1992\u20132013 change in regional\
    \ GDP in 2010 U.S. dollars; Average annual change in regional GDPpc binned by\
    \ regional income deciles; Damages calculated as 2 to 4% GDPpc losses in tropical\
    \ regions when holding average temperatures constant."
  7: Extreme heat intensity accounts for almost 10% of the overall damages despite
    being based on <2% of days in the year.
  10: Models that include country-level GDP per capita have prediction errors of less
    than 7% of the average regional log GDP per capita.
