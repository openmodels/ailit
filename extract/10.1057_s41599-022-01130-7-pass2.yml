Drivers of Risk:
  1: Emission levels, economic, social, and governance adaptation readiness; Climate
    change exposure and sensitivity; low income
  7: Climate change and its impacts. GHG emissions.
  9: Rising levels of anthropogenic GHG emissions intensify climate vulnerability
    across sectors.
  11: Income level (GDP per capita), climate change vulnerability
  12: Climate change vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability); low
    climate readiness (social, governance, economic); GHG emissions; habitat loss
    and fragmentation; extreme weather events.
  14: Stocks of periodic GHG emissions spur sectoral climate change vulnerability
Highlights:
  1: High-income economies with high social, governance, and economic readiness have
    low climate vulnerability; developing economies with low income have high climate
    change exposure and sensitivity; climate change has become a global burden
  7: Countries with high sectoral climate vulnerabilities are mostly located in Sub-Saharan
    Africa, Southern Asia, Eastern Asia, and South-East Asia.
  9: 'The climate reduction effect is highest on health services compared to water
    services, in the order: health > food > habitat > ecosystem services > infrastructure
    > water.'
  11: The paper explores the relationship between GHG emissions, income levels, climate
    change readiness, and climate change vulnerability across different regions and
    countries.
  12: There is a negative relationship between climate change readiness and climate
    change vulnerability; High governance readiness coupled with high social and economic
    climate readiness decline climate change vulnerability; developing economies generally
    exhibit high climate change vulnerability attributed to low social readiness,
    poor governance readiness, reduced income level, and low economic readiness.
  14: Outgrowth in income level and investment (economic, social, and governance adaptation
    readiness) decline investment cost by reducing long-term environmental damage;
    implies income level and adaptation readiness play essential role in mitigating
    climate change and its impacts.
Methodology:
  1: "Romano\u2013Wolf technique to test multiple hypotheses and present the spatial\u2013\
    temporal severity of climate vulnerability and readiness."
  7: Country-level data categorization based on quantiles to capture continuous intervals
    with uniform distribution. Examined the geographical risk distribution of sectoral
    climate vulnerabilities across economies.
  11: "The analysis uses average data spanning 2016\u20132017 to account for the inception\
    \ and impact of the SDGs. It captures regional convergence of sampled economies."
  12: The paper analyzes the relationship between climate vulnerability and climate
    readiness (social, governance, and economic) based on average annual frequency.
  14: Uses cross-section dependence test and Romano-Wolf estimation technique to assess
    heterogeneity across 192 countries. The study accounts for non-cooperative business-as-usual
    scenarios and dynamic games indirectly.
More Notes:
  1: The study examines climate change vulnerability across sectors, focusing on the
    nexus between emission levels, economic, social, and governance adaptation readiness.
  7: The vulnerability scores indicate the tendency of economies to experience the
    negative impacts of climate risks.
  11: The paper uses a cross-sectional analysis of countries, grouping them by region.
    The figures seem to show general relationships, not specific estimates of adaptation
    costs/benefits.
  12: The paper mentions the importance of income in reducing climate change vulnerability
    and the limited ability of low-income countries to take precautionary measures
    against future climate events due to limited resources.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Sectoral climate vulnerabilities (ecosystem services, food, health, human habitat,
    infrastructure, and water)
  7: Vulnerability of Food Sector, Ecosystem Services, Human Habitat, Health Sector,
    Water Sector, and Infrastructure Sector to climate change.
  11: Anthropogenic GHG emissions and climate change readiness and vulnerability
  12: No relevant information

  7: 'Country-level GHG emissions (e.g., Rwanda: 0.54 ton CO2eq/cap).'
  9: "Shows percentage decline in ecosystem services vulnerability (0.28\u20131.48%)\
    \ and sectoral climate vulnerability mitigation due to income level rise (0.02\u2013\
    0.15%)."
  11: Figure 7 shows the nexus between anthropogenic GHG emissions and income level
    across income groups, presenting data from 2016-2017. Figure 8 shows the relationship
    between climate change readiness and climate change vulnerability.
  12: Figure 9 presents a scatter plot relating Climate Change Social Readiness Score
    (1.0 = High) and Climate Change Vulnerability Score (1.0 = High) across sampled
    economies, showing regional convergence.
