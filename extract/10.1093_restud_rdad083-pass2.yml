Drivers of Risk:
  6: Climate-related risks, physical damages, policy and regulatory risks, shifts
    in preferences.
  7: Regulatory risk and stakeholder risk are identified as the main drivers affecting
    long-term investors.
  18: Environmental scores, governance scores (entrenchment index), firm productivity,
    markup, book equity, stock market risk (beta)
  34: "Shift from active to passive investment management by institutional investors,\
    \ changes in investors\u2019 demand elasticity."
  35: Climate-related risks including physical damages, policy and regulatory risks
    (e.g., carbon tax, capital regulation), and shifts in preferences (stakeholder
    risk including changing preferences of employees and customers).
  36: Stakeholder risk (shifts in investor preferences towards green firms) and regulatory
    risk (insurance companies and pension funds increasing demand for green firms).
  38: "Climate-related risks (due to changes in regulation or stakeholders\u2019 preferences),\
    \ transition from active to passive management"
  40: Climate Change News (Engle et al., 2020)
  47: Environmental scores (from Sustainalytics), Governance scores (entrenchment
    index), Foreign sales (fraction of sales from abroad), Lerner index (operating
    income after depreciation divided by sales), and Market beta (60-month rolling
    market beta).
  51: Environmental scores, governance scores (entrenchment index), foreign sales,
    operating income after depreciation divided by sales (Lerner), market beta.

  56: Environmental scores (from Sustainalytics), Governance Scores (entrenchment
    index from Bebchuk, Cohen, and Ferrell (2009)), Foreign sales (fraction of sales
    from abroad), Lerner (operating income after depreciation divided by sales), and
    market beta (60-month rolling market beta where the market is the local MSCI index)
    are used as factors.

Highlights:
  7: Long-term investors, banks, and passive investment advisors benefit from the
    transition, while active investment advisors and hedge funds experience a decline
    in AUM.
  18: Environmental score is positively correlated with firm valuation, while governance
    score (entrenchment index) is negatively correlated. The characteristics included
    account for a large fraction of the cross-sectional variation in prices.
  34: A shift towards passive investment management makes environmental and governance
    characteristics increasingly important in explaining valuation ratios. Reactivating
    investors (to 2007 levels) increases assets under management for small-active
    investment advisors and hedge funds while decreasing it for other institutional
    investors.
  36: A broad shift in investor preferences towards green firms (stakeholder risk)
    has a much larger impact on firm valuations than a shift by only long-term investors
    (regulatory risk). Regulating insurance companies may not have much of an impact
    on asset prices, yet it may have important financial stability advantages in the
    insurance sector. Long-term investors, banks, and passive investors are the main
    beneficiaries of the transition, while hedge funds and active investors are exposed
    to climate-related transition risk.
  38: Foreign investors are particularly important for the valuation of green firms,
    while small-active investment advisors are important for the valuation of well-governed
    firms. Hedge funds, per dollar of assets that they manage, have the largest impact
    on prices.

    Climate Change News (Engle et al., 2020)
  45: The table illustrates how market capitalization relates to sales and net income
    across firms of different sizes at two points in time.
  47: Environmental scores have a positive and statistically significant effect on
    the valuation ratio. Governance scores have a negative and statistically significant
    effect on the valuation ratio.
  51: Environmental and governance scores have statistically significant coefficients
    in explaining valuation ratios. The adjusted R-squared values indicate the explanatory
    power of the models.
  52: Increasing the weight institutions place on environmental scores leads to a
    statistically significant positive change in valuation. The impact is greater
    when only long-term investors increase their coefficient on environment.
  53: Time Series of Ownership by Institutional Type
  56: Figure 5 shows 'Demand Curve Summary by Investor Type'.
  62: The figure shows how AUM changes for different types of investors (Brokers,
    Hedge Funds, Long-Term, Private Banking, Inv. Small Passive, Inv. Small Active,
    Inv. Large Active, Inv. Large Passive) when they increase their focus on environmental
    scores.
  68: Decomposes the fraction of market-to-book ratios explained by characteristics
    into the fraction due to expected returns and the fraction due to expected growth
    rates.
Methodology:
  6: Uses a framework to quantify two key dimensions of climate-related risks on asset
    prices; not a comprehensive analysis of all risks.
  7: The analysis uses a framework that involves counterfactuals to capture regulatory
    and stakeholder risks, calculating changes in asset prices and investors' AUM,
    and involves developing climate stress tests.
  10: The paper develops a model of investor beliefs and asset pricing, where investors
    rely on public information ('characteristics', x) to estimate expected returns
    and risk. The model incorporates a budget constraint and assumes a normally distributed
    background risk factor. An extension of the model considers the feedback from
    valuation ratios to firm characteristics.
  18: 'Panel regression of valuation ratios on characteristics, using annual end-of-year
    data, cross-sectionally standardized. Two samples are studied: 2000 to 2019 and
    2010 to 2019.'
  34: Regression analysis of firm valuations on firm characteristics in the last quarter
    of 2019. The analysis examines the impact of re-activating investors to 2007 levels
    of activity.
  35: Uses a framework to quantify key dimensions of climate-related risks. Considers
    counterfactual scenarios where the element of environmental score increases for
    long-term investors and where preferences of consumers and employees change.
  36: Regression analysis using actual log market-to-book ratios in 2019 and changes
    in log market-to-book ratios in two counterfactual scenarios (stakeholder and
    regulatory risk).
  38: "Estimated asset demand system is used to analyze the impact of key trends in\
    \ the asset management industry on firm valuations and investors\u2019 welfare.\
    \ The methodology can be adopted to other characteristics and applied to individual\
    \ institutional investors as well as groups of institutions. Can be used to develop\
    \ 'climate-risk stress tests' for a broader set of climate-related risks."
  40: Analysis of investor behavior related to index funds, working paper (Egan et
    al., 2020); Hedging strategies based on Climate Change News (Engle et al., 2020)
  45: The table is based on firm-level fundamentals from CRSP and Compustat (annual
    data).
  47: Regressions of end-of-year valuation ratios on firm-level characteristics, including
    year fixed effects. Columns 1 and 2 are from 2010-2019, and Columns 3 and 4 are
    from 2000-2019.
  49: Analysis involves calculating the percent change in market cap if assets of
    an investor type are reallocated to other institutional investors in proportion
    to their assets. The values presented are the time series average of quarterly
    values. The sample runs from 2000 to 2019.
  51: Regression analysis of firm-level data (market-to-book ratios) on firm characteristics.
    The analysis is performed using data from 2019, with a counterfactual scenario
    where institutional demand curves are re-activated to 2007 levels.
  52: Regression analysis of log market-to-book ratios on firm characteristics, including
    ESG scores; counterfactual scenarios where institutions place more weight on environmental
    scores. The model is applicable to 2019 data.
  53: Equity holdings data are from FactSet. Share of ownership is the annual average
    by institution type. Holdings data is quarterly from FactSet.
  56: Analysis uses histograms of time-series averages of institutions' demand curve
    estimates, with weighted averages reported for each investor type, calculated
    using AUM-share averages across years for each investor group; Firm-level fundamentals
    are from CRSP and Compustat, holdings data from FactSet; sample runs from 2000
    to 2019; Governance and Environment data begins in 2010.
  62: The analysis examines the impact of increasing the coefficient on environment
    by 0.1 for all institutions (red bars) and only for long-term investors (blue
    bars). The results are AUM share-weighted log changes in AUM for institutions
    of that type, averaged to present a single yearly observation for 2019.
  68: Variance decomposition of market-to-book ratios based on characteristics, expected
    returns, and expected growth rates. The analysis is cross-sectional and assumes
    characteristics are standardized and potentially uncorrelated.
More Notes:
  10: The paper seems to be focused on asset pricing and investor behavior in response
    to firm characteristics. It does not explicitly mention climate change, adaptation,
    or any direct macroeconomic or macro-fiscal variables. The analysis is theoretical
    and may not directly translate into quantifiable impacts on GDP, fiscal balances,
    or adaptation costs and benefits.
  18: The governance score is an entrenchment index, implying that higher values are
    associated with weaker governance.
  34: The paper implies that if the trend of declining activeness in institutional
    investors continues, hedge funds and small-active investment advisors would underperform
    relative to other investors.
  36: The effect is noticeable only for the environmental score. Insurance regulators
    are concerned about how transition risk may affect the highly-leveraged insurance
    sector.
  38: The paper focuses on how investors price environmental and governance characteristics.
  40: Several papers are focused on financial market reactions and risk factors, which
    could be indirectly relevant if they inform macroeconomic modeling or risk assessment
    of climate change impacts. Climate Change News is being used as a specific risk
    factor. (Engle et al., 2020)
  45: The number '45' appears at the very end of the paper
  47: Regressions control for Log Book Equity, Foreign Sales, Lerner, Sales to Book,
    Dividend to Book, and Market Beta. T-statistics are clustered by year. Data is
    firm-level, from CRSP and Compustat. The data are valuation ratios based on firm
    level data, not macroeconomic data.
  49: The study uses holdings data from FactSet and firm-level fundamentals from CRSP
    and Compustat. The analysis focuses on the impact of asset reallocation (driven
    by climate-related repricing) on market capitalization, not directly on macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes at a national level, but does highlight changes in investor
    behaviour.
  51: The table presents regression coefficients and associated t-statistics (in parentheses).
    All characteristics are standardized cross-sectionally by year. Data sources include
    Sustainalytics, FactSet, CRSP, and Compustat.
  52: The table examines the impact of environmental scores on valuation, with different
    scenarios reflecting institutional investor preferences.
  53: The page analyzes the share of total ownership by type of institution over time,
    which is not directly related to macroeconomic/fiscal risks of climate change
    or adaptation costs/benefits at a national level.
  56: The paper examines demand curves by investor type, seemingly in relation to
    environmental and governance factors. However, it is unclear if any connection
    between the factors and macroeconomic outcomes is explicitly stated on this page.
    The focus appears to be on investor behavior and demand curves of different investor
    types, rather than on macroeconomic or fiscal risks of climate change and the
    costs/benefits of adaptation at a national level.
  62: Firm-level fundamentals are from CRSP and Compustat. Holdings data are from
    FactSet.
  68: The paper deals with financial ratios (market-to-book) and their relationship
    to expected returns and growth rates, not directly with macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    impacts of climate change or adaptation costs/benefits.

Quantitative material:
  18: "A one standard deviation increase in the environmental score is associated\
    \ with a 17% increase in a firm\u2019s market-to-book ratio. A one standard deviation\
    \ increase in the governance score (entrenchment index) is associated with an\
    \ 10% lower valuation ratio."
  34: A one-standard deviation change in the environmental index increases valuation
    ratios by 23% in 2019, this would reduce by 14% if investors are as active as
    in 2007. Entrenchment index response would reduce toward zero from -14% to -5%
    per one standard deviation increase if investors are as active as in 2007. Small-active
    investment advisors experience a 6.9% increase in assets under management if investors
    are as active in 2019 as they were in 2007, and hedge funds experience a 14.1%
    increase under the same conditions.
  35: Simulates an increase of 0.1 in the environmental score coefficient for long-term
    investors, which implies a 10% increase in portfolio weight for a one standard
    deviation change in the environmental score (from a baseline level of 5% to 5.5%).
  36: In the stakeholder risk counterfactual, the coefficient for environmental score
    increases by 0.57 from an original value of 0.23. In the regulatory risk counterfactual,
    the coefficient increases by 0.03 from 0.23.
