Highlights:
  1: Increased demand for green firms would benefit long-term investors, banks, and
    passive investment advisors at the expense of hedge funds and small-active investment
    advisors.
  2: The portfolio tilt of a group of investors toward certain characteristics only
    has a small impact on asset prices because other investors quickly rebalance to
    other stocks, mitigating price impact; active strategies or portfolio tilts toward
    certain characteristics can have a large impact on asset prices
  5: Foreign investors help to lower the cost of capital for green firms in the US
  7: The paper finds that long-term investors, banks, and passive investment advisors
    benefit from the transition, while active investment advisors and hedge funds
    would experience a decline in AUM. The framework can be used to develop and implement
    climate stress tests.
  8: The paper presents a simple model to illustrate how the importance of various
    investors in the price formation process can be measured.
  14: No relevant information
  16: The paper documents firm characteristics along the firm size distribution, as
    measured by market capitalization, showing how market capitalization, sales, and
    profits are distributed across different segments of firms.
  18: The environmental score is positively correlated with the market-to-book ratio.
    Governance score (entrenchment index) is negatively correlated with valuation
    ratio. Firm characteristics account for a large fraction of the cross-sectional
    variation in valuation ratios.
  26: Larger, passive, and foreign investors show a stronger demand for greener firms.
    Foreign investors tilt away from firms with entrenched management, while larger
    investors show the opposite tendency. Demand is more elastic for smaller and more
    active investors. Foreign investors tilt their portfolios more strongly toward
    greener and less entrenched firms. Foreign investors prefer to hold safer firms
    relative to domestic investors.
  27: This paper endogenizes the distribution of assets to explore the impact on investors'
    assets and a measure of welfare.
  28: Small-active investment advisors and hedge funds have the largest impact on
    prices. Hedge funds play an outsized role in repricing per dollar of AUM. Long-term
    investors have a modest impact on prices.
  29: Small-active investment advisors are the most influential on pricing of the
    environmental index; foreign investors influence pricing of the environmental
    index the least.
  30: Small-active investment advisors and hedge funds are important for the pricing
    of governance in US markets.
  31: Institutional investors have become more passive over time, and this trend has
    impacted different firms and investors.
  32: "Latent demand and demand elasticities contributed equally to the reduction\
    \ in the active share between 2007 and 2019, while portfolio tilts to characteristics\
    \ increased the investors\u2019 active share."
  33: No relevant information
  36: A broad shift in investor preferences (stakeholder risk) has a larger impact
    on firm valuations than regulatory risk focused on long-term investors. Regulating
    insurance companies may not have a large impact on asset prices but could have
    financial stability advantages. Long-term investors, banks, and passive investors
    are the main beneficiaries of the transition to green firms. Hedge funds and active
    investors are exposed to climate-related transition risk.
  37: The paper highlights the development of a framework to conduct climate stress
    tests for financial institutions and to quantitatively assess how much different
    investors contribute to incorporating information into prices and long-horizon
    expected returns.
  38: Foreign investors are particularly important for the valuation of green firms,
    while small-active investment advisors are important for the valuation of well-governed
    firms.
  42: The importance of climate risks for institutional investors and the impact of
    these risks on market efficiency are highlighted.
  45: The table shows a shift in the firm size distribution and concentration of sales
    and net income among top market capitalization deciles between 2000 Q1 and 2019
    Q4.
  46: Lists the largest investors by type based on assets under management in 2019
    Q4. Examples include Households, Large Passive Investors, Large Active Investors,
    etc.
  47: Environmental scores have a positive and statistically significant association
    with firm valuation ratios (market-to-book ratio and cumulative earnings growth)
    in the 2010-2019 period. This suggests that firms with better environmental performance
    tend to have higher valuations.
  48: Analysis explores the relationship between institutional investor behavior,
    fund manager characteristics, and firm-level environmental/governance factors.
  49: Provides data on how repricing varies by investor type (Large/Small, Passive/Active,
    Hedge Funds, Long-Term, Private Banking, Brokers, Foreign).
  51: Environment shows coefficient of 0.23 (t=4.61) in the original regression and
    -0.14 (t=-4.43) in the changed regression.
  52: The analysis shows how changes in investor preferences for environmental scores
    impact company valuations (log market-to-book ratios), with the coefficients indicating
    the magnitude and direction of these effects.
  54: Shows the time series average of within-year AUM weighted coefficients for different
    institutional investor types.
  55: Comparison of baseline estimates with alternative estimates, specifically focusing
    on the coefficient on log market-to-book.
  56: The vertical lines report the weighted average of the estimates for each investor
    type.
  57: Summary of demand curves by investor domicile. Environmental scores are from
    Sustainalytics, Governance Scores are the entrenchment index from Bebchuk, Cohen,
    and Ferrell (2009), Foreign sales is the fraction of sales from abroad, Lerner
    is operating income after depreciation divided by sales, and market beta is 60-month
    rolling market beta where the market is the local MSCI index.
  66: Developed a simple numerical algorithm to solve the non-linear moment conditions
    efficiently.
  67: The analysis highlights the connection between valuation regressions, earnings
    predictability regressions, and traditional variance decompositions.
Methodology:
  1: Asset demand is estimated as a function of prices and characteristics; portfolio
    tilts across investors affect firm's valuation ratios.
  2: "Develops a framework to quantitatively assess the importance of individual investors\
    \ or groups of investors for the pricing of characteristics in the cross section\
    \ of valuation ratios and expected returns; develops a simple model in which investors\
    \ use a set of characteristics to assess each firm\u2019s expected future profitability\
    \ and riskiness"
  5: counterfactual prices are used to re-estimate cross-sectional valuation regressions
    and document how the regression coefficients and residuals change.
  7: The paper develops a new framework to quantify how characteristics are priced
    in the cross-section of valuations and expected returns through the portfolio
    choice of institutional investors and households. It uses portfolio holdings data
    to learn about valuations and expected returns, employing a demand system asset
    pricing model. The results are applicable to long-term investors (pension funds
    and insurance companies).
  8: The paper develops an instrumental variables shrinkage estimator to estimate
    investor-specific demand curves.
  9: The paper models investor preferences and firm behavior to analyze asset pricing,
    considering factors like risk aversion, expected growth rate, and riskiness of
    future profits. It uses equations to model the intra-period budget constraint,
    absolute risk aversion coefficients, and return on equity. The model assumes investors
    may disagree on the systematic exposure of stocks to a factor and expected growth
    rate, but have full information about other investors' beliefs and agree to disagree.
  13: The paper uses an empirically-tractable asset demand system, building on Koijen
    and Yogo (2019). It focuses on the top 90% of stocks by market capitalization.
  14: The paper models investor's portfolio allocation across stocks based on choice
    sets, considering factors like market-to-book ratio, firm characteristics, and
    latent demand. The model uses a demand curve where portfolio holdings are log-normally
    distributed. Market clearing condition is included to complete the model.
  16: The paper uses Sustainalytics environmental ratings and an entrenchment index
    to assess firm performance related to environmental and governance factors. A
    quarterly sample from 2000-2019, with a subsample from 2010-2019 (due to data
    availability of environmental and governance scores) is used. The methodology
    can be applied to other characteristics or environmental/governance scores.
  18: 'Panel regression of valuation ratios on firm characteristics with year fixed
    effects. Characteristics are cross-sectionally standardized by quarter. Two samples
    are studied: 2000 to 2019 and 2010 to 2019 (due to data availability on environmental
    and governance scores). Annual end of year data is used.'
  19: The asset demand system is estimated using equations (10) and (11), with investor
    demand curves estimated using equation (14). Characteristics are standardized
    cross-sectionally by quarter. The analysis uses a decomposition of the market-to-book
    ratio.
  21: Uses a ridge instrumental variables estimator of the asset demand curve, augmenting
    GMM moment conditions with a ridge penalty to address limited data due to concentrated
    portfolios. The model is estimated using quarterly data.
  26: The paper uses regression analysis to examine the relationship between investor
    characteristics (AUM, active share, foreign investor status) and coefficients
    related to demand elasticity and firm characteristics.  Institutional type fixed
    effects are not used when size and active share are already controlled for.
  27: Uses a demand system to estimate the impact of different investors on valuations
    by considering an outflow equal to their assets.  It solves for market-clearing
    prices using an algorithm from Koijen and Yogo (2019), updating the distribution
    of assets in each iteration.
  29: Counterfactual equilibrium prices and valuation ratios are computed, and regressions
    in (13) are re-run.
  30: Uses the valuation model of Cohen, Polk, and Vuolteenaho (2003) and Campbell,
    Polk, and Vuolteenaho (2009) to map changes in valuations to expected returns.
  31: The authors use an estimated asset demand system to analyze the impact of the
    transition from active to passive management and the pricing of climate-related
    risks. They also define an aggregate measure of active risk taking by institutions.
  32: "The active share (ASit) is decomposed into components related to latent demand,\
    \ portfolio tilts to characteristics, and elastic demand using a specific formula\
    \ involving portfolio weights, market portfolio weights, and combinations of parameters\
    \ (\u03B20i,\u02C6\u03B21i, \u03F5it (n))."
  33: The analysis involves adjusting demand system coefficients and scaling factors
    to match 2007 active share components, solving for asset prices and assets under
    management.
  34: "We rep ort the impact on firm valuations by regressing mbt (n), in the first\
    \ column, and the change, mbCFt (n) \u2212mbt (n), in the second column, on firm\
    \ characteristics in the last quarter of 2019"
  35: "Uses a framework to quantify key dimensions of climate-related risks, focusing\
    \ on regulatory and stakeholder risk. Examines counterfactual scenarios including\
    \ an increase of 0.1 in the element of \u03B2i,t associated with the environmental\
    \ score for long-term investors and a second counterfactual designed to capture\
    \ stakeholder risk."
  36: 'Regression analysis with changes in log market-to-book ratios in two counterfactual
    scenarios: stakeholder risk and regulatory risk. Based on 2019 data.'
  37: The paper proposes using observable characteristics to capture risks and developing
    a comprehensive framework for climate stress tests, involving the adjustment of
    characteristics and asset demand.
  38: "An estimated asset demand system is used to analyze the impact of key trends\
    \ in asset management on firm valuations and investors\u2019 welfare."
  42: The methodologies employed include analysis of financial data, econometrics,
    and demand system approaches to asset pricing. Some papers are working papers.
  45: The analysis is based on firm-level annual data from CRSP and Compustat. It
    examines the firm size distribution by market capitalization deciles.
  46: Data is from FactSet, and the figures represent assets under management (AUM)
    for 2019 Q4.
  47: Regressions of end-of-year valuation ratios on firm-level characteristics, including
    environmental and governance scores. Year fixed effects are included, and t-statistics
    are clustered by year. Data from CRSP and Compustat are used. Environmental scores
    from Sustainalytics are used.
  48: Analysis involves time-series and cross-sectional regressions; regressions are
    estimated with data from Compustat, CRSP, Sustainalytics
  49: Analysis uses holdings data from FactSet and firm-level fundamentals from CRSP
    and Compustat, from 2000 to 2019. Values are time series averages of quarterly
    values.
  51: Regressions of log market-to-book ratios and changes in log market-to-book ratios
    on characteristics, standardized cross-sectionally by year.  The new market-to-book
    ratios are calculated in a scenario where institutional demand curves in 2019
    re-activated so that components of active share are the same as in 2007. Data
    is end of year for 2019.
  52: The analysis uses regressions to assess the impact of various factors, including
    environmental scores, on company valuations. The data covers the end of the year
    2019. Characteristics are standardized cross-sectionally by year.
  54: Uses an expanding window approach to compute investment universes for varying
    backward and forward looking periods, with baseline estimates using 3 years back
    and 0 years forward. The numbers on the x-axis are trailing window in years and
    the second number the forward window in years.
  55: Compares baseline estimates with alternative estimates from a model that allows
    for endogenous dividend-to-book, and with an instrument for market equity constructed
    omitting hedge funds; firm-level fundamentals are from CRSP and Compustat, holdings
    data are from FactSet.
  56: Each panel is a histogram of the time-series average of each institutions demand
    curve estimate. To average the coefficients, we first compute the AUM-share average
    for a given investor group and year. We then average these across years for a
    given investor group.
  57: We report the weighted average of the parameter estimates for each investor
    in that group. To average the coefficients, we first compute the AUM-share weighted
    average for a given investor group and year. We then average these across years
    for a given investor group. The sample runs from 2000 to 2019. Governance and
    Environment data begins in 2010.
  64: The paper uses 60-month rolling regressions of excess returns on the excess
    returns of the CRSP Value Weighted index, with excess returns calculated using
    1-month treasury bill rates. Betas are winsorized at the 2.5% and 97.5% levels.
    Dividend-to-book and sales-to-book are winsorized at the 97.5% level by quarter.
    Lerner values less than -1 are set to -1. Data from CRSP and Compustat are merged
    to FactSet by CUSIP. Sustainalytics data are merged on CUSIP by taking the most
    recent observation up to 12 months before.
  66: "Uses a shrinkage estimator with a ridge penalty to estimate investor-specific\
    \ parameters (\u03B2i) based on moment conditions related to investor behavior.\
    \ Implements cross-validation to choose the shrinkage parameter (\u03BB) by splitting\
    \ holdings randomly in half by year, estimating the model on one half, and computing\
    \ the mean-squared error on the left out sample."
  67: The methodology involves an iterative procedure using a first-order Taylor expansion
    to estimate coefficients in a moment condition framework. It uses initial estimates
    based on linear moment conditions omitting zero holdings. The analysis connects
    valuation and earnings predictability regressions to variance decompositions.
    The analysis is applicable to understanding how characteristics influence valuation,
    earnings, and returns.

    investors; increase to 21% if assets were reallocated from small-active investment
    advisors to the other institutional investors
  7: The paper computes asset prices and investors' AUM under different counterfactual
    scenarios to quantify the impact of regulatory and stakeholder risks. It finds
    that long-term investors, banks, and passive investment advisors benefit from
    the transition, while active investment advisors and hedge funds experience a

  29: A one standard deviation increase in the environmental score would move prices
    by 17%. If foreign investors would leave the US and their assets are allocated
    to all other domestic institutions, a one standard deviation increase in the environmental
    score would move prices only by 14%.
  30: A one standard deviation change in the entrenchment index would lead to a 9%
    change in a firm's valuation ratio, as opposed to a 10% decline.
  31: A one standard deviation change in the environmental index changes valuation
    ratios by 4%, which translates to 20bp per annum.
  32: "Decline in active share (ASit) is decomposed into three components between\
    \ 2007 and 2019. Latent demand and demand elasticities contributed equally to\
    \ the reduction in active share. Portfolio tilts to characteristics increased\
    \ investors\u2019 active share."
  33: The page includes a quantitative finding where the scaling factors for the counterfactual
    demand system are given by (c1, c2, c3) = (1.93, 0.88, 1.34).
  35: "A shift of 0.1 in \u03B2i,t associated with the environmental score increases\
    \ portfolio weight by 10% for a one standard deviation change in the environmental\
    \ score (e.g., from 5% to 5.5%). A 0.1 adjustment in the coefficient is approximately\
    \ one standard deviation in the cross-sectional distribution of this coefficient\
    \ across investors."
  36: Stakeholder risk counterfactual increases the coefficient for environmental
    score by 0.57 from an original value of 0.23. Regulatory risk counterfactual increases
    the coefficient by 0.03 from 0.23.
  37: The paper discusses adjusting profits for a given carbon tax policy and constructing
    counterfactuals to assess investor risk perception, suggesting a quantitative
    approach, although specific quantities are not mentioned on this page.
  38: This paper can be used to develop 'climate-risk stress tests' for a broader
    set of climate-related risks.
  42: The papers provide quantitative analysis related to financial metrics, stock
    returns, and investment decisions.
  45: Provides data on the distribution of firms by market capitalization deciles,
    showing the percentage of firms, total sales, and net income concentrated within
    each decile for 2019 Q4 and 2000 Q1.

  47: Regression coefficients and t-statistics for "Environment" variable in valuation
    and earnings regressions for 2010-2019 and 2000-2019 periods. Adj. R2 and Within
    Adj. R2 are also provided.
  48: No relevant information
  49: Shows percentage changes in market capitalization ("Total Repricing") if assets
    of an investor type are reallocated to other institutional investors, as well
    as the percentage of assets under management ("Share AUM") for each investor type.
    Also, it provides a "Repricing AUM Scaled" value, which is the total repricing
    divided by the share of assets under management.
  51: Change in Valuation Regression Coefficients are provided for several variables
    including Environment, Governance, Foreign Sales, and Lerner; also reports Adj.
    R2
  54: Presents estimates of coefficients on log market-to-book for various constructions
    of the investment universe, averaged across time series and weighted by AUM.
  55: Figure displays the coefficient on log market-to-book for two alternative estimates
    versus the baseline estimates; sample runs from 2000 to 2019.
  56: Demand coefficients are multiplied by 100 except for LN mebe.
  57: Demand coefficients are multiplied by 100 except for LN mebe.
  64: Presents equations (25), (26) and (27) which can be used to quantitatively derive
    asset prices and investor demand.
  66: "Shrinkage parameter \u03BB = 0.2 in the US and \u03BB = 0.3 in GB."
  67: "The page presents equations for calculating coefficients (\u03B2), but there\
    \ are no specific quantitative results presented on this page."
