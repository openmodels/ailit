Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased risks of wildfires as a consequence of climate change
  2: Increasing risk of forest fires, climate change impacts such as increased temperature
    and decreased precipitation
  3: Changes in climate (falling annual precipitation, increasing annual temperature)
    lead to more frequent and pronounced heat waves; Weather conditions and fuel loading
    are the main causes of forest fires in Portugal; Forest fire severity has increased
    and climate change scenarios suggest that this trend will continue.
  6: Burned area (Burned Areait), temperature (Tempit), precipitation (Precipit).
  7: Burned areas (forest and shrub lands), temperature, and rainfall.
  8: Burned areas (current and lagged), population density, crime rate.
  9: Temperature (third quartile), Precipitation (third quartile)
  10: Increase in burned areas due to climate change, specifically related to average
    temperature and precipitation (A1B scenario).
  11: Future burned area projections (linked to climate change); Weather condition
    changes
  12: Burned area projections impacting inbound tourist arrivals; weather conditions
    (temperature and precipitation changes).
  13: Burned areas negatively impacting domestic and inbound tourist arrivals in Portugal.
Highlights:
  1: Forest fires have a considerable negative impact on the number of tourist arrivals
    in Portugal, both domestic and inbound; the estimated annual costs to the Portuguese
    economy due to the impact of burned areas in 2030 range between e17.03 and 24.18
    million for domestic tourist arrivals and between e18.26 and 38.08 million for
    inbound ones, and in 2050 those costs will increase at least fourfold.
  2: Burned areas have a considerable negative impact on the number of tourist arrivals;
    Portugal's economy will face increased annual costs due to burned areas, impacting
    domestic and inbound tourist arrivals.
  6: Burned areas and weather conditions (temperature and precipitation) affect the
    number of tourist arrivals.
  7: Burned areas have a significant negative impact on both domestic and inbound
    tourist arrivals, with a cumulative effect spanning multiple years.
  8: Burned areas have a negative and statistically significant impact on both domestic
    and inbound tourist arrivals, even when lagged.
  9: Temperature has a statistically significant positive impact on the share of burned
    area, while precipitation has a statistically significant negative impact. The
    share of burned areas is expected to increase in most municipalities in Portugal
    by 2030 and 2050, with inland municipalities close to Spain suffering the most.
  10: Projected increase in burned areas will lead to a reduction in domestic tourist
    arrivals in the majority of Portuguese municipalities by 2030 and even more so
    by 2050.
  11: Burned areas are projected to negatively affect tourist arrivals, particularly
    in the Porto and Lisbon metropolitan areas; The impact is expected to worsen from
    2030 to 2050; Some municipalities may benefit from weather condition changes
  12: Hotel revenue losses due to weather conditions are projected to increase significantly
    from 2030 to 2050, especially for inbound tourism. Under an optimistic scenario
    losses could reach as high as 17.46% of 2016 revenue by 2050.
  13: Tourism decline in Portugal linked to increased burned areas, affecting local
    economies and suggesting prolonged impacts.
Methodology:
  1: "Using data for 278 municipalities for the 2000\u20132016 period to estimate\
    \ the impact of forest fires on tourism, providing predictions for 2030 and 2050."
  2: Uses data from 2000 to 2016 on 278 municipalities to estimate the impact of burned
    areas on the number of inbound and domestic tourists; provides predictions for
    2030 and 2050.
  6: Panel linear regression model with fixed effects is used to estimate the relationship
    between tourist arrivals and burned areas. A panel data model with fixed effects
    is used to estimate the relationship between burned area and weather conditions.
    The model can make predictions for the number of tourist arrivals that will be
    affected by burned areas in 2030 and 2050.
  7: Panel data analysis using data from 278 municipalities in Portugal from 2000
    to 2016. Includes a Heckman procedure to address non-random missing values. Models
    the impact of burned areas, temperature, and precipitation on tourist arrivals.
    Projections extend to 2030 and 2050.
  8: Regression analysis with fixed effects (time and municipality) and municipality
    trends. Standard errors are robust to heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation, and
    spatial correlation. The analysis considers the impact of burned areas on tourist
    arrivals, controlling for population density and crime rate.
  9: Regression analysis with time and municipality fixed effects and municipality
    trends; Analysis of share of burned area in Portuguese municipalities based on
    weather data. Model considers burned areas increases from 0 to 1.32 per cent.
  10: The study estimates the future cost for the tourism sector due to increased
    burned areas under the A1B scenario, projecting impacts on domestic tourist arrivals
    for each municipality in Portugal. Results are based on average temperature and
    precipitation during the study period.
  11: The impact of burned area projections on tourist arrivals is estimated using
    the A1B scenario; Results are interpreted with respect to the average temperature
    and precipitation of the period studied
  12: 'The analysis estimates hotel revenue losses based on the difference in temperature
    and precipitation between the 2002-2016 period and projections for 2030 and 2050,
    using the A1B scenario. Two scenarios are considered: a ''realistic'' scenario
    with annual tourist arrival growth rates half of those in an OECD report and an
    ''optimistic'' scenario based on OECD tourism growth rates (5.2% and 11.4% for
    domestic and inbound tourists).'
  13: Analysis uses econometric modeling with municipality-level data on burned areas
    and tourist arrivals, with temperature and precipitation added for robustness
    checks, and projections under the A1B scenario for 2030 and 2050.
More Notes:
  2: Focuses on the particular case of Portugal, where tourism represents an important
    portion of GDP and employment; the A1B scenario is based on rapid economic growth,
    low population growth and rapid introduction of new and more efficient technology.
  7: The impact of burned areas appears to be persistent. The study utilizes data
    from Statistics Portugal (INE) and the National Water Resources Information System
    (SNIRH).
  8: "The analysis uses the Mill\u2019s inverse ratio to account for potential bias.\
    \ The paper also considers the impact of temperature and precipitation on the\
    \ annual share of burned areas, finding statistically significant effects."
  10: The study simplifies the exposure of results to municipalities and presents
    them in figures. Some municipalities may initially benefit from climate change
    in 2030, but fewer are expected to do so by 2050.
  12: The maps indicate the impact of burned area projections on inbound tourist arrivals.

Quantitative material:
  1: Estimated annual costs to the Portuguese economy due to the impact of burned
    areas in 2030 range between e17.03 and 24.18 million for domestic tourist arrivals
    and between e18.26 and 38.08 million for inbound ones; in 2050, those costs will
    increase at least fourfold.
  2: "Under the A1B scenario for future burned area projections, results show that\
    \ in 2030 most municipalities will face a reduction in domestic and inbound tourist\
    \ arrivals up to 2 and 0.5 per cent, respectively. This situation will be aggravated\
    \ in 2050 when the reduction in domestic and inbound tourist arrivals for most\
    \ municipalities will range between 2\u20134 per cent and 0.5\u20131 per cent,\
    \ respectively. Overall, the estimated annual costs to the Portuguese economy\
    \ due to the impact of increased burned areas in the year 2030 range between e17.03\
    \ and 24.18 million for domestic tourist arrivals and between e18.26 and 38.08\
    \ million for inbound tourist arrivals, depending on the assumptions made about\
    \ overall growth of the tourism sector. In 2050, those costs will increase by\
    \ a factor of at least four."
  3: "Tourism in Portugal directly contributed 9.2 per cent of GDP and 9 per cent\
    \ of the total employment in 2016, generating e12.7 billion in international tourism\
    \ revenues; tourism constitutes 16.7 and 48.3 per cent of total exports and service\
    \ exports, respectively; burned area reached about 40 per cent of Portugal in\
    \ the 1975\u20132007 period."
  6: The equations (3) and (4) are provided, showing how the number of tourist arrivals
    and burned area are modeled.
  7: Overall, a 1 per cent increase in burned areas in a given year reduces the number
    of domestic and inbound tourist arrivals in that year and in the following year
    by 3.53 and 1.12 per cent, respectively.
  8: Burned Areas have a statistically significant negative impact on tourist arrivals.
    Specifically, in the domestic model, a one-unit increase in current burned area
    leads to a -1.6634 change in log of tourist arrivals, while a one-unit increase
    in lagged burned area leads to a -1.3848 change in log of tourist arrivals. In
    the inbound model, the coefficients are -0.4199 and -0.5969 respectively.
  9: A 0.0014 increase in the share of burned area for each unit increase in temperature
    (statistically significant at the 5% level); A -0.0001 decrease in the share of
    burned area for each unit increase in precipitation (statistically significant
    at the 10% level).
  10: In 2030, 193 municipalities will face a reduction in domestic tourist arrivals
    in the 0-2% range, 74 in the 2-4% range, and 1 above 4%. Some municipalities benefit,
    with the largest benefit being 1.086 percentage points, the smallest 0.10 percentage
    points, and the mean 0.47 percentage points. In 2050, fewer municipalities benefit,
    with the largest, smallest and mean benefits being 0.816, 0.05 and 0.26, respectively.
  11: "Reduction in domestic tourist arrivals in municipalities in 2030 and 2050 (0-2%,\
    \ 2-4%, >4% ranges); Impact on inbound tourist arrivals in municipalities in 2030\
    \ and 2050 (-0.35-0%, 0-0.5%, 0.5-1%, 1-1.48% ranges); Estimated losses of Hotels\u2019\
    \ Revenues in 2030 and 2050 under a 'Realistic' scenario (2.6% and 5.7% respectively)"
  12: "Estimated annual losses of hotel revenues in 2030 and 2050 under realistic\
    \ and optimistic scenarios for domestic and inbound tourism, expressed in euros\
    \ and as a percentage of 2016 revenues. For example, under the realistic scenario,\
    \ inbound tourism is estimated to lose \u20AC18,256,655 (0.63%) in 2030 and \u20AC\
    84,841,559 (2.93%) in 2050."
  13: "Estimated losses include a 0\u20132% reduction in domestic tourist arrivals\
    \ by 2030 and 2\u20134% by 2050; 0\u20130.5% reduction in inbound tourist arrivals\
    \ by 2030 and 0.5\u20131% by 2050."
