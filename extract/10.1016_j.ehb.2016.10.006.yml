Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increasing purchase prices and droughts are identified as key shocks impacting
    Senegalese subsistence farmers.
  2: Vulnerability to climate variability and international food price shocks impacting
    Senegal's economic outcomes.
  4: Droughts, increasing purchase prices (price shocks), idiosyncratic natural, biological,
    economic or health shocks
  7: Droughts and floods are the hazards that have most affected the Senegalese population.
  14: Increased prices and drought episodes (both considered shocks)
  16: Shocks from natural, biological, economic, and health spheres impact child health
    and wellbeing.
  17: Concomitant price and drought shocks; shock effects unmanaged.
  24: Economic shocks (increase in purchase prices, decrease in sales prices, loss
    of key income source), natural hazards (drought, cold wave), biological hazards
    (crop pest/insects invasion), and health shocks (death of a member).
  25: Drought, extreme cold, crop pest, increase in purchase prices, decrease in sales
    prices, loss of key income source, death of a household member.
  28: Drought, extreme cold, crop pest, increase/decrease in purchase/sales prices,
    loss of key income source, and death of household member.
  29: Shocks impacting outcomes include Drought, Extreme Cold, Crop Pests, Increase
    in Purchase Prices, Decrease in Sales Prices, Loss of Key Income Source, and Death
    of Household Member.
  30: Drought, Extreme cold, Crop pest, Increase in purchase prices, Decrease in sales
    prices, Loss of key income source, Death of HH member
Highlights:
  1: Senegal is very vulnerable to climate variability and international price developments.
  2: Emphasis on the compounded effects of multiple shocks, which may worsen household
    welfare more than single shock analyses predict.
  4: Drought and price shocks significantly impact child health, particularly for
    poor farming households; the effects of multiple shocks are interdependent and
    must be carefully dealt with.
  14: Increased prices and drought have a negative effect on child weight-for-age.
    The combined effect of drought and price shocks can be mitigating, possibly due
    to income effects for net producers during times of scarcity.
  16: Households dependent on agriculture and asset-poor households are most adversely
    affected by these shocks.
  17: Positive income effects from price and drought shocks on rural children; urban
    effects not analyzed but expected to differ.
  24: Several shocks show a statistically significant difference in incidence between
    2009 and 2011 (increase in purchase prices, loss of key income source, drought,
    death of a member). There are also statistically significant correlations between
    various shocks in both 2009 and 2011.
  25: Drought has a statistically significant negative impact on child weight-for-age.
    Death of a household member has a statistically significant positive impact on
    child weight-for-age. Year 2011 * Increased Prices has a statistically significant
    negative impact on child weight-for-age. Year 2011 * Drought has a statistically
    significant negative impact on child weight-for-age.
  28: Drought has a statistically significant negative impact on households that cultivate
    peanuts, particularly if the main occupation of the male breadwinner is farming.
    Extreme cold has a statistically significant positive impact on households where
    the main occupation of the male breadwinner is not farming. Death of household
    member has a statistically significant positive impact on households where the
    main occupation of the male breadwinner is farming.
  30: Drought has a statistically significant negative impact on girls. Extreme cold
    has a statistically significant positive impact on boys. Loss of key income source
    has a statistically significant negative impact on boys.
Methodology:
  1: The study employs a dataset of children in rural Senegal from 2009 and 2011 and
    accounts for structural changes between survey periods. It uses a multi-shock
    approach to assess the impact of shocks on child health.
  2: Multi-shock analysis focusing on the impact on subsistence agriculture in rural
    Senegal.
  4: Inter-temporal utility model with income uncertainty; uses geo-referenced precipitation
    data and controls for access to markets, child health history, and farming decisions;
    analysis based on survey indicators and descriptive statistics in Senegal
  14: The analysis uses multi-shock estimates, conditional on child, household, and
    village observables and survey year (2009 and 2011). Triple interaction terms
    are used to account for competing effects of shocks (price increases and drought
    after 2011). Robustness checks include redefining shock measures, adding control
    variables, and using sub-samples.
  24: The analysis is based on survey data from the years 2009 and 2011. Correlations
    between different types of shocks are calculated. Significance levels are indicated
    by asterisks.
  25: "Village-year fixed effects estimations with standard errors clustered at the\
    \ village level. Data from 165 villages with a total of 3,810 observations. Additional\
    \ control variables include age and gender of the child, head of the household\
    \ and mother\u2019s age and gender, if the mother resides in the household, mother\u2019\
    s literacy, if the mother is related to the head of the household, number and\
    \ size of parcels of land cultivated, ownership of poultry, livestock, radio and\
    \ mobile phone, dummy variables for water, toilet facilities and migrant members."
  28: Village-year fixed effects estimations with standard errors clustered at the
    village level. The analysis uses dummy variables for shock events and controls
    for various household and individual characteristics.
  29: Village-year fixed effects estimations with standard errors clustered at the
    village level.
  30: Village-year fixed effects estimations with standard errors clustered at the
    village level. All shock variables are dummy variables.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the micro-level impact of shocks on child health in rural
    Senegal, rather than macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level.
  2: This page sets up the context for analyzing the impact of environmental and price
    shocks but does not provide specific outcomes or quantitative data.
  4: Focuses on household level analysis, especially farming households in Senegal.
  7: The paper focuses on the impact of shocks on child health indicators, rather
    than macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes directly. While it mentions price
    shocks, the emphasis is on household-level effects, not nation-wide economic impacts.
  14: The study uses data from 2009 and 2011. The effect of shocks is considered in
    the context of overall improvements in child health during this period. The impact
    of shock intensity is also considered on a Likert scale.
  24: The 'difference' in shock incidence is significantly higher in 2011 for shocks
    with p-value <0.01. The absence of data on 'Decrease in sales prices' and 'Increase
    in purchase prices' for 2011 prevents calculation of correlation between all shocks.
  25: The table explores interaction effects between drought, increased prices, and
    the year 2011.
  28: The outcome variable is not explicitly defined in the provided text. The inclusion
    of interaction terms with 'Year 2011' and 'Increased Prices' suggests an attempt
    to capture time-specific or price-specific effects of the shocks. The P-value
    F-test for joint significance of drought coefficients is reported.
  30: The table presents robustness checks for boys and girls subsamples; Significance
    levels are denoted by */ **/ *** at 10/5/1%. The dependent variable is not explicitly
    stated.
