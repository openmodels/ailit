Drivers of Risk:
  9: Higher vulnerability indicated by the WRIv and INFORMv indices.
  10: Climate-related hazard events (floods, storms, and droughts); national vulnerability
    (based on WRI and INFORM indices).
  11: Hazard events (floods, droughts, storms) and vulnerability levels (Very Low
    to Very High) drive the outcomes.
  12: Vulnerability (as measured by combined index, WRIv index, and INFORMv index).
  13: Climate threats like sea-level rise; being landlocked increases vulnerability
    in some regions.
  15: Climate-influenced hazards, including increasing frequency and intensity of
    hazards, droughts, flash floods, extreme heat events, and coastal flooding/sea-level
    rise.
Highlights:
  9: WRIv and INFORMv indices are valid predictors of disaster outcomes at national
    and regional levels.
  10: Mortality per hazard event is significantly higher in countries with very high
    vulnerability. There are statistically significant correlations between vulnerability
    indices and disaster impacts.
  11: Mortality per event generally increases with vulnerability. Economic losses
    per event are compared between very high vulnerability countries and other categories.
    The analysis focuses on the relative impact of hazards in very highly vulnerable
    countries. Significant differences in mortality per event are indicated across
    all index systems, based on the Kruskal-Wallis test results.
  12: Countries with wealth and exposed capital assets face the highest absolute economic
    losses, while BRICS countries face the highest number of affected people. Economic
    damages per event are higher in countries with low vulnerability than in very
    highly vulnerable countries. Countries with high vulnerability have a higher mortality
    per hazard event.
  13: Vulnerability rankings of SIDS differ, with Pacific SIDS generally more vulnerable
    than Caribbean SIDS; Landlocked countries in Africa, Southern Asia, and South
    America have higher average vulnerability; Vulnerability differs significantly
    in the Global South, particularly in Asia and Africa.
  15: Vulnerability assessments, combined with climate information, are highly relevant
    to informing adaptation policies; hazard information alone might lead to misdirected
    priorities. Adaptation requires financial, institutional and human resources to
    address existing adaptation gaps.
Methodology:
  9: Sensitivity analysis performed on vulnerability components of WRIv and INFORMv
    indices; both indices have explanatory power for disaster outcomes.
  10: Analysis of national-scale data from the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT)
    for storms, floods, and droughts hazards between 2010 and 2019. Calculation of
    combined vulnerability index based on WRI and INFORM indices. Nonparametric test
    to see if the impact of mortality differs significantly according to five vulnerability
    categories. Correlation analysis between vulnerability indices and various disaster
    impacts (number of events, mortality per event, economic losses per event, people
    affected per hazard event).
  11: The analysis uses clustered boxplots and bar graphs to compare mortality, economic
    losses, and population affected per hazard event across different vulnerability
    categories and index systems (Combined, INFORMv, WRIv). The Kruskal-Wallis test
    is used to assess statistical significance.
  12: The analysis uses the Combined Index, World Risk Index (WRIv), and the INFORM
    Risk Index (INFORMv) to categorize countries by vulnerability and then examines
    mortality, economic damages, and affected populations. The analysis utilizes descriptive
    statistics and comparisons across vulnerability categories. They also look at
    insurance coverage.
  13: Calculates the average of WRI and INFORM vulnerability components, aggregates
    them to UNSD regions; uses boxplots to visualize vulnerability.
More Notes:
  10: The study uses both national and regional level data. Fig. 3A was classified
    using a manually modified classification in order to account for extreme outliers.
    Correlation results are presented at both national and regional levels for the
    combined vulnerability index.
  11: The paper focuses on comparing impacts across vulnerability categories but does
    not provide direct estimates of national-level macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
    The selected hazards are floods, droughts, and storms.  The analysis is limited
    to vulnerability components of WRI and INFORM indexes when comparing indices.
  12: Economic loss trends from EMDAT database must be interpreted with caution, since
    economic loss reporting is often underdeveloped and contains missing or underestimated
    data for many disasters. There is a lack of reliability for the scores of small
    countries with low vulnerability in Europe like Liechtenstein.
  13: Includes a boxplot of vulnerability by region, differentiating SIDS; The INFORM
    Index includes all SIDS, however, 37% of the SIDS are in the top 25% of countries
    lacking reliable data; SIDS omitted from other analyses (SDG index) due to missing
    data.

    using mortality and affected population data. It does not directly address macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes related to climate change or adaptation costs and benefits
    at a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  9: Higher vulnerability correlates with higher mortality and less economic loss
    per event.
  10: Economic losses and mortality per hazard event (floods, storms, and droughts)
    at the national and regional level.
  11: Economic losses per hazard event are examined, though not directly tied to macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes at the national level.
  12: Economic damages per event, number of people affected per hazard event, mortality
    per 100,000 inhabitants, economic losses as a percentage of GDP.
  13: No relevant information
  15: The paper discusses economic damages due to natural hazards modified by climate
    change, and highlights the importance of societal vulnerability as a metric, suggesting
    that even normal hazards can result in ill health or damage to physical assets,
    particularly for the poor.
Quantitative material:
  10: Mortality per event is 15 and 7 times higher in countries with very high vulnerability
    compared to countries with very low and low vulnerability, respectively. Correlation
    analysis between loss due to past disaster events and vulnerability, with significant
    correlations (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05) reported for mortality per event, economic
    losses per event, and people affected per hazard event, correlated with WRI, INFORM,
    and combined vulnerability indices. Table 5 shows correlation coefficients such
    as -0.278 for Economic losses per event and WRI vulnerability
  11: The paper provides quantitative comparisons of mortality, economic losses, and
    population affected in very highly vulnerable countries compared to others, expressed
    as 'number of times higher/lower'. Kruskal-Wallis H statistics and p-values are
    included for mortality per event.
  12: Economic damages per event are higher in countries with low vulnerability than
    in very highly vulnerable countries; countries categorized as very highly vulnerable
    in the combined index have 16 times lower economic damages per event compared
    to countries with very low vulnerability; very highly vulnerable countries in
    the WRIv and INFORMv indices have 18 times and 8 times less economic damages per
    event to report compared to countries categorized as having very low vulnerability;
    number of affected people per hazard event was about 11 times higher in countries
    categorized as very high vulnerable compared to very low vulnerable; high and
    very high vulnerable countries in Africa, Asia, and Small Island States had a
    higher mortality per 100,000 inhabitants compared to other countries classified
    as low vulnerable; economic losses (in the last ten years) as a percentage of
    GDP is higher in very high vulnerable countries compared to very low vulnerable
    countries as per INFORMv.

    Haiti 7.0/0.75, Guinea-Bissau 5.6/0.71).
