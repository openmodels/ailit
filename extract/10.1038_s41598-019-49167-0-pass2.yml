Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Historical global warming in West Africa, leading to a 1\xB0C temperature increase\
    \ (2000-2009) with more frequent heat and rainfall extremes."
  2: Human-induced climate change, specifically focusing on the impact of changes
    in temperature and precipitation on crop yields.
  5: Historical climate change, specifically changes in daily mean, maximum and minimum
    2-m air temperatures, precipitation, downward shortwave radiation flux, relative
    humidity and 10-m wind speed.
  6: Technological advancements (increased use of N fertilizer and improved varieties)
    contribute significantly to the yield trends.
  7: Historical climate change (temperature and rainfall changes).
  8: Negative yield impacts and production losses due to historical climate change,
    particularly temperature change, are observed, with more severe impacts in the
    northern Sahel.
  9: Increased evapotranspiration due to warming leads to water deficit stress, significantly
    impacting yields.
  10: Higher frequency and intensity of heavy rains in West Africa, potentially attributable
    to global warming, impacting agricultural production.
  12: Human-influenced climate change (temperature and precipitation changes)
  13: Climate change impacts, particularly increasing temperatures, lead to crop yield
    losses in Niger.
Highlights:
  1: Historical climate change has already led to significant yield losses (10-20%
    for millet, 5-15% for sorghum) in West Africa, resulting in substantial economic
    losses (billions of USD annually).
  2: "This study aims to estimate the average crop production losses of millet and\
    \ sorghum in West Africa due to human-induced climate change during the last decade\
    \ 2000\u20132009, offering a basis to depict a more specific view of the adaptation\
    \ costs in crop production systems in that region."
  5: The study simulates the impact of historical climate change on crop yields and
    production, comparing outcomes under factual climate conditions with counterfactual
    scenarios without human influence on the climate.
  6: Both crop models (CYGMA and SARRA-H) generally overestimated sorghum yields,
    with varying performance in reproducing regional average yields and interannual
    variability.
  7: Simulated impacts on average crop yields in 2000-2009 due to historical climate
    change varied by location and between the two crop models.
  8: Significant crop yield and production losses in West Africa due to climate change,
    especially for millet and sorghum, with the greatest impacts in Niger, Senegal,
    Mali, Nigeria, and other key producing countries.
  9: CYGMA model suggests CO2 fertilization and technological improvements do not
    compensate for increased heat and water stress.
  10: The CYGMA model captured yield growth driven by CO2 fertilization and technological
    advancements better than SARRA-H.
  12: Climate change has already had a substantial negative impact on millet and sorghum
    yields in West Africa.
  13: Climate change has already had a significant impact on the regional climate
    in the Sahel, with negative consequences for the production of major cereals in
    the region, with Niger as a specific example.
Methodology:
  1: Used a large ensemble of historical climate simulations from an atmospheric general
    circulation model and two process-based crop models (SARRA-H and CYGMA). Generated
    two ensembles of 100 historical simulations of yields of sorghum and millet, one
    based on actual climate and the other on a non-warming counterfactual climate.
    Applied to conditions in West Africa during the period of 2000-2009.
  2: A modeling framework is used to estimate historical yield without human influence
    on climate, then compared to realistic climate simulations (including natural
    and human factors).  MRI-AGCM3.2 climate model with ensemble simulations; SARRA-H
    and CYGMA crop models; statistical tests (Student's t-test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov)
    to assess robustness of changes.  Analysis applies to West Africa.
  5: Crop simulations are performed using factual and counterfactual (no human influence
    on climate) climate data as inputs to crop models (CYGMA and SARRA-H) to estimate
    the impacts of historical climate change on crop yields.  Yield impacts are calculated
    at a grid-cell level by comparing historical and non-warming counterfactual crop
    simulations. These are then aggregated to country level.  Production impact is
    calculated from yield impact, baseline yield, harvested area, and producer prices.
  6: Crop models (CYGMA and SARRA-H) used to simulate historical yields of millet
    and sorghum, with post-processing used to improve agreement.
  7: "Two crop models (CYGMA and SARRA-H) were used to simulate impacts on crop yields\
    \ in West Africa (20\xB0W to 15\xB0E; 4\xB0N to 18\xB0N) during 2000-2009, comparing\
    \ counterfactual climate conditions to factual climate conditions. Student t-tests\
    \ and Kolmogorov tests were used to assess the statistical significance of the\
    \ differences."
  8: Climate and crop modeling using SARRA-H and CYGMA models to simulate yield impacts
    and economic losses due to historical climate changes over 2000-2009; comparison
    to counterfactual climate conditions.
  9: SARRA-H and CYGMA models are used to simulate crop yields and assess the impacts
    of temperature and rainfall variations.
  10: The study used a large ensemble of climate simulations and two crop models (SARRA-H
    and CYGMA) to estimate the effects of historical climate change on crop production
    in West Africa.
  12: Two independent crop models (SARRA-H and CYGMA) simulated millet and sorghum
    yields with and without human-induced climate change in West Africa for 2000-2009.
  13: "Crop models (CYGMA and SARRA-H) were used to estimate yield impacts, comparing\
    \ factual climate conditions to a counterfactual climate condition. A simple multiplication\
    \ method was used as well: (3.4 billion USD \xD7 0.35 \xD7 0.50 \xD7 0.22) to\
    \ determine a production loss of 0.13 billion USD."
More Notes:
  1: The estimated production losses can be a basis for loss and damage associated
    with climate change and useful in estimating the costs of adaptation.
  5: "The study focuses on rainfed crops, particularly pearl millet and sorghum in\
    \ West Africa. The study uses a bias-corrected MRI-AGCM3.2 climate model. CYGMA\
    \ model required a 60-yr long soil moisture spin-up (1958\u20131960 \xD7 20 times)\
    \ before crop simulation. It makes assumptions on annual nitrogen application\
    \ rates."
  6: The SARRA-H model was noted for its better performance in capturing interannual
    variability compared to the CYGMA model.
  7: The CYGMA model accurately reproduces yield trends, while the SARRA-H model better
    reproduces year-to-year variability. FAO yield statistics in West Africa might
    be derived from data imputation or unofficial data sources.
  13: The models simulated more important impacts in the north of the Sahel, where
    the warming is the highest; Niger, Senegal and Mali are most affected by climate
    change. Limitations exist due to the quality of the reported data in the studied
    region, including data imputation by the FAO.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Estimated production losses in West Africa (2000-2009) associated with historical
    climate change (relative to a non-warming counterfactual) are valued at 2.33-4.02
    billion USD for millet and 0.73-2.17 billion USD for sorghum.
  2: Financial production losses due to human-induced climate warming, specifically
    for millet and sorghum in West Africa.
  5: Impact on annual production of crops at a country level (USD); simulated country
    annual yield impact relative to the simulated average factual yield in the baseline
    period (ratio); Grid-cell yield impact (ratio).
  7: Crop yields (millet and sorghum) are impacted by climate change.
  8: "Estimated economic losses over West Africa from climate change in 2000\u2013\
    2009 amounted to 2.99 billion USD for millet and 1.89 billion USD for sorghum\
    \ using the SARRA-H model, and 1.65 billion USD for millet and 0.69 billion USD\
    \ for sorghum using the CYGMA model."
  12: Crop production losses (millet and sorghum yield)
  13: Crop production losses have likely led to important financial losses in several
    Sahelian countries, specifically focusing on millet production in Niger.
Quantitative material:
  1: Millet yield reductions of 10-20% and sorghum yield reductions of 5-15% due to
    altered climate conditions. Production losses of 2.33-4.02 billion USD for millet
    and 0.73-2.17 billion USD for sorghum (2000-2009).
  2: Estimates of average crop production losses (millet and sorghum) due to human-induced
    climate change during 2000-2009.  Crop price data are used to quantify financial
    production losses.
  5: Equations (1), (2) and (3) provide formulas for calculating yield and production
    impacts. Baseline period is 2000-2009.
  6: Significant increase of 27.7% in number of rainy days exceeding 50 mm/day in
    the last decades between factual and counterfactual simulations.
  7: Table 4 shows changes in climate indices between counterfactual and factual climate
    conditions. For example, Annual Mean Temperature increased by 1.0 degrees, Annual
    Rainfall increased by 0.9%, Heavy Rainfall Events increased by 11.6%, Very Heavy
    Rainfall Events increased by 27.7%, Very Hot Days increased by 841.0%, Onset Day
    increased by 0.6 days.
  8: 'Predicted yield losses for millet and sorghum across West Africa; Millet yield
    loss: 17.7% (SARRA-H) and 10.9% (CYGMA); Sorghum yield loss: 15.0% (SARRA-H) and
    5.9% (CYGMA). Estimated economic losses: 2.99 billion USD for millet and 1.89
    billion USD for sorghum using SARRA-H; 1.65 billion USD for millet and 0.69 billion
    USD for sorghum using CYGMA.'
  12: Millet yield would have been 11% to 18% higher and sorghum yield 6% to 15% higher
    in West Africa in 2000-2009 if human influence on climate was excluded.
  13: "In Niger, climate change impact on millet production cost between 0.47 and\
    \ 0.54 billion USD per year during the decade 2000\u20132009, while the average\
    \ GDP of the country was 3.4 billion USD during the same decade."
