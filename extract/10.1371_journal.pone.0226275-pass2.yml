Drivers of Risk:
  1: Storm surge and sea level rise (SLR).
  2: Storm surge, sea level rise, changes in tidal range, salinity, sediment supply,
    human interventions for residential purpose, coastal dike construction.
  3: Coastal flooding, storm wind-driven wave effects (wave setup), sea level rise
    impacts on coastal wetlands and marshes, hurricanes
  5: Historical and synthetic storms (Hurricane Sandy (2012), 25-year storm, 50-year
    storm) were selected to capture variations in coastal flooding.
  7: Floods, Sea Level Rise (SLR), Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes, marsh migration.
  8: Sea level rise (SLR) leading to increased flood depths and inundation of residential
    parcels.
  9: Hurricane Sandy storm event, sea level rise, storm events (25-year and 50-year).
  11: Storm surge flooding, Sea level rise (SLR).
  12: Storm surge, sea level rise, extreme flooding events.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Property damage from storm surge and sea level rise.
  2: Coastal flooding from storm surge is a major concern for coastal communities
    worldwide, and is expected to increase with potential changes in storm climatology
    and projected sea level rise.
  3: Coastal resilience enhancements and the protection of communities from recurrent
    coastal flooding are being evaluated.
  5: No relevant information
  7: This study evaluates the ecosystem service of shoreline protection provided by
    coastal wetlands and marshes for residential properties.
  8: Reduction in flooding and property damage due to natural habitats.
  9: Reduction in flooding and property damage due to natural habitats.
  11: Property damage from storm surge flooding.
  12: The study evaluates the flood protection provided by natural habitats to residential
    structures.
Highlights:
  1: Protecting and preserving natural habitats can contribute to enhance coastal
    resilience.
  2: The study aims to integrate the natural variability of coastal storm surge and
    impacts of SLR on the natural habitats into the economic valuation of the flood
    protection services.
  3: Improves upon existing literature by using parcel-level property values, accounting
    for storm wind-driven wave effects, and incorporating SLR impacts on coastal wetlands
    and marshes; provides insights on valuing natural habitats for coastal resilience
    and supporting natural habitats restoration initiatives.
  5: Hurricane Sandy (2012), a 400-year storm event, was selected as the historical
    storm as it is currently the most catastrophic storm event in the Mid-Atlantic.
    The 25-year storm and Hurricane Sandy passed through the study area, whereas the
    selected 50-year storm traveled parallel to the shoreline.
  7: Natural habitats provide shoreline protection to residential properties by reducing
    flood damages. SLR and marsh migration are predicted to reduce marsh area.
  8: Natural habitats can significantly reduce the number of inundated residential
    parcels, flood depths, and property damage during storm events, both under current
    and future sea level rise scenarios. Regularly flooded marsh expands by 274.65%,
    Tidal Flat expands by 2,506.14%
  9: Natural habitats reduce flood elevation and property damage, particularly during
    extreme storm events. The percentage changes are highest under the 50-year storm
    event.
  11: Marsh shows higher potential in the 25-year and 50-year storms than in Hurricane
    Sandy, indicating higher efficacy of natural flood protection during relatively
    frequent, low intensity storms.
  12: Natural habitats can reduce both storm surge flood depth and property damage
    under current and future marsh conditions and under sea level rise. Natural habitats
    may offer better protection from relatively frequent, low intensity storms.
Methodology:
  1: Combined coastal storm surge modeling (ADCIRC+SWAN) and economic analysis to
    evaluate the role of natural habitats in coastal flood protection. SLAMM was used
    to project potential migration and habitat transformation in coastal marshes due
    to SLR in 2050. A counterfactual land cover approach was implemented to estimate
    the amount of flooding avoided due to the presence of natural habitats.
  2: The coupled version of the Advanced Circulation model (ADCIRC) and Simulating
    Waves Nearshore model (SWAN) was applied to compute the storm surge flooding for
    historical and synthetic storms. The Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM)
    was used to simulate the potential changes in the natural habitats, especially
    coastal wetlands and marshes, due to SLR. Simulated flood depths were combined
    with publicly available parcel-level property data to compute flood damages for
    selected storms in both current and future conditions. The reduction in damages
    due to the presence of the natural habitats are estimated based on the value of
    protected residential properties.
  3: An interdisciplinary team collaborated to integrate scientific solutions into
    effective ecosystem management plans; incorporates SLR and its impacts on coastal
    wetlands and marshes; uses parcel-level property values; accounts for storm wind-driven
    wave effects
  5: A storm surge model was used with LULC to assess coastal resilience. SLAMM was
    applied to project potential changes in natural habitats due to SLR in the year
    2050.
  8: SLAMM (Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model) simulation of land cover change under
    different scenarios. Flood modeling using ADCIRC+SWAN to assess flood depths and
    property damage with and without natural habitats.
  9: ADCIRC+SWAN model was used to simulate flooding with and without habitat present
    under current and Hurricane Sandy storm conditions.
  11: The SLAMM model addresses eco-geomorphic feedbacks in the coastal marshes.
  12: The study uses a model formulation to compare flood depth with and without natural
    habitats under different storm events and sea level rise scenarios. The results
    are applicable to coastal communities and ecosystems.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on three coastal counties in New Jersey adjacent to the Jacques
    Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve (JCNERR).
  2: The study focuses on protected coastal wetlands and marshes adjacent to the Jacques
    Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve (JCNERR) in New Jersey.
  3: Study area is the JCNERR and portions of three surrounding counties in New Jersey.
  5: The study acknowledges limitations in representing vegetation in the storm surge
    model, specifically the lack of explicit accounting for vegetation heights, density,
    or diameter, and notes that improvement of model parameters and processes is beyond
    the scope of the study.
  8: The paper highlights the role of natural habitats in enhancing coastal resilience
    by mitigating flood impacts.
  9: The study focuses on the flood protection value of coastal marshes and wetlands,
    specifically in the JCNERR.  The study considers current and future (2050) conditions.
  11: One potential limitation of this study is the representation of wave energy
    dissipation by vegetation in modeling the interaction between storm surges and
    natural habitats, as the model does not account for different plant characteristics
    and their wave dissipation mechanisms.
  12: The study only considered three storm events, which is a limitation. The authors
    emphasize the need for primary data collection in coastal wetlands and marshes
    during storm events for improved quantification of their flood reduction capacity.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Wetlands can reduce up to 14% of both the flood depth and property damage during\
    \ relatively low intensity storm events. Avoidance of up to $13.1 million and\
    \ $32.1 million in residential property damage in selected coastal counties during\
    \ the \u201850-year storm\u2019 simulation and Hurricane Sandy under current sea\
    \ level conditions, and in the year \u20182050 SLR scenario\u2019, respectively."
  2: The study estimates the value of flood protection services provided by protected
    coastal wetlands and marshes adjacent to the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine
    Research Reserve (JCNERR) to a cross-section of three coastal counties in New
    Jersey.
  3: Uses parcel-level property values when estimating avoided damages; wave setup
    can contribute significantly to the increase in water levels due to hurricanes
  5: "Synthetic storms have a 4% (\u201C25-year storm\u201D) and 2% (\u201C50-year\
    \ storm\u201D) respective probability of occurrence in any given year."
  7: Marsh area is predicted to reduce by about 5.4% due to SLR and marsh migration.
    Transitional salt marshes and irregularly flooded marshes are predicted to decrease
    by around 38% and 36%, respectively.
  8: 'SLAMM simulated land cover change, including changes in tidal and non-tidal
    swamp, marsh, and open water areas (Table 2). Up to 23.1% fewer residential parcels
    inundated under current conditions and up to 3.7% fewer under future conditions
    when natural habitats are present. Mean parcel-level flood depths reduced by up
    to 4.8% (current) and 13.9% (future). Property damage can decrease up to 4.4%
    (current) and 4.0% (future). Table 3 shows estimated flood depth and property
    damage changes from each storm event. Example: Under current conditions, 25-year
    storm flooded parcels decrease by 23.13% due to habitat presence.'
  9: Coastal wetlands and marshes in the JCNERR can lower the flood elevation by a
    maximum of 0.2 to 0.4 meters; averaged reduction in flood elevation and depth
    varies from 0.03 to 0.06m; natural habitats can reduce total property damage in
    the study area up to 13.8% under current conditions and up to 6.1% in future conditions;
    avoided damage by natural habitats during a single storm event can range from
    $8,500,000 to $13,000,000 under current conditions and from $1,500,000 to $32,000,000
    under 2050 conditions.
  11: Area of tidal flats are predicted to increase nearly twenty-six-fold.
  12: The study uses the relative difference between two scenarios to estimate the
    potential of natural habitats to relatively reduce flood depth.
