Drivers of Risk:
  1: Storm surge and sea level rise affecting coastal communities and ecosystems.
  2: Storm surge, sea-level rise, changes in natural habitats (coastal wetlands and
    marshes).
  3: Coastal flooding, hurricanes, sea level rise (SLR), storm wind-driven wave effects.
  4: Coastal flood hazards from storm surge and sea level rise (SLR) are the primary
    drivers of risk identified in this study area.
  5: Storm surge, waves, sea level rise, hurricanes (specifically, Hurricane Sandy
    and synthetic storms from the USACE NACCS database).
  6: Sea level rise (SLR), storms (Sandy, 50-year storm, 25-year storm).
  7: Storm events, future land use/land cover (LULC) conditions, sea level rise (SLR),
    marsh migration.
  8: Sea level rise, storms (25-year, 50-year, Sandy).
  9: Storm events (Hurricane Sandy), sea level rise conditions.
  10: Storm events (25-year, 50-year, Hurricane Sandy), Sea Level Rise (SLR).
  12: Storm surge; sea level rise; extreme flooding events.
  14: Sea-level rise; related stresses; storm surge; wave erosion.
Highlights:
  1: Salt marshes can reduce up to 14% of flood depth and property damage during low-intensity
    storm events; monetary avoidance of up to $13.1 million in residential property
    damage during '50-year storm' and up to $32.1 million during Hurricane Sandy under
    current sea level conditions.
  2: The study estimates the value of flood protection services provided by protected
    coastal wetlands and marshes in three coastal counties in New Jersey. The study
    also integrates the natural variability of coastal storm surge and impacts of
    SLR on natural habitats into the economic valuation of flood protection services.
  3: Quantifies the capacity and value of natural habitats to protect communities
    from recurrent coastal flooding. Improves upon existing literature by using parcel-level
    property values, accounting for wave effects, and incorporating SLR impacts. Provides
    insights for valuing natural habitats and supporting restoration initiatives.
  7: Natural habitats like coastal wetlands and marshes provide shoreline protection,
    reducing flood damages to residential properties. Sea level rise is expected to
    decrease the amount of marsh available.
  8: Natural habitats can significantly reduce flooding and property damage. The impact
    is greater in terms of flood depth reduction under future conditions (13.9%) compared
    to current conditions (4.8%), while number of flooded parcels reduced is greater
    under current conditions (23.1% fewer) compared to future conditions (3.7% fewer).
  9: Natural habitats reduce flood elevation and property damage during storm events;
    the percentage change in avoided damage is highest under the 50-year storm event;
    flood protection value in absolute terms is highest for the 50-year storm and
    Hurricane Sandy under current and 2050 conditions.
  10: Natural habitats can protect up to $13.1 million of residential property damage
    in the current condition and $32.1 million in the future scenario (2050) in the
    study area during selected storm events; The per square kilometer value of flood
    protection services varies from $53,000 to $138,000 under current and future conditions.
  12: Natural habitats can reduce both storm surge flood depth and property damage
    under current and future marsh conditions and under sea level rise; Natural habitats
    may offer better protection from relatively frequent, low intensity storms; Ecosystem
    service values (flood protection) are conservative estimates.
  14: Natural habitats, particularly coastal wetlands and marshes, provide valuable
    services in reducing storm surge and wave impacts, offering coastal resilience
    and flood protection.
Methodology:
  1: Combination of coastal storm surge modeling (ADCIRC+SWAN) and economic analysis;
    SLAMM used for habitat transformation projections; counterfactual land cover approach
    for flooding estimation.
  2: The study uses the Advanced Circulation model (ADCIRC) coupled with the Simulating
    Waves Nearshore model (SWAN) to compute storm surge flooding for historical and
    synthetic storms. The Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) simulates changes
    in natural habitats due to SLR. Flood depths are combined with parcel-level property
    data to compute flood damages. The reduction in damages due to the presence of
    natural habitats is estimated based on the value of protected residential properties.
    This analysis is applied to three coastal counties in New Jersey, adjacent to
    the Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve (JCNERR).
  3: Uses parcel-level property values for damage estimation, accounts for storm wind-driven
    wave effects, incorporates SLR impacts on coastal wetlands and marshes. Interdisciplinary
    team (coastal engineers, marine and social scientists) collaborated with natural
    resources managers. Spatially explicit results.
  4: The study uses the coupled ADCIRC and SWAN models to simulate coastal flooding
    from storm surge and waves. ADCIRC computes water surface elevation and current
    velocity, while SWAN computes the wave spectrum, considering wave breaking, shoaling,
    refraction, and wind-induced wave generation. The models use the same computational
    mesh, domain, and boundary. Land use and land cover information from the C-CAP
    database are used to represent wetlands and marshes and their dissipation mechanisms
    through frictional drag coefficients.
  5: The study uses historical and synthetic storm data to model coastal flooding
    variations, applying SLAMM to project natural habitat changes due to sea-level
    rise (SLR) in 2050. The modeling approach considers storm surge and wave dynamics,
    including the representation of vegetated canopies through frictional parameters,
    but acknowledges limitations in explicitly accounting for vegetation heights and
    density.
  6: The SLAMM (Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model) model is used to simulate the impact
    of sea level rise (SLR) on coastal ecosystems. It uses coastal elevation, land
    use/land cover (LULC), tidal and shoreline information, wave action, accretion
    rate, and the rate of SLR to model changes in coastal ecosystems, such as wetland
    conversions and shoreline modification. The model applies different threshold
    values for tidal range, salinity, and proximity to shoreline to determine whether
    coastal marshes can sustain their elevation relative to sea level or if they will
    migrate inland, convert into other land cover, or submerge under the sea. The
    model was set up with a start date of 2010 and run to 2050.
  7: The damages avoided method is used, simulating flood elevations for 'habitat
    present' and 'habitat absent' scenarios using the ADCIRC+SWAN model. The difference
    in residential flood damages between the two scenarios is the value of avoided
    damages. Flood damages are estimated using depth-damage functions, property data,
    and mean flood depth.
  8: ADCIRC+SWAN model used to estimate flood depths and property damage. SLAMM (Sea
    Level Affecting Marshes Model) simulated land cover change. Analysis applicable
    to current conditions and future (2050 SLR) scenarios.
  9: Uses the ADCIRC+SWAN model to simulate flooding with and without habitat present
    under current and future conditions.
  10: Parcel-level property damage estimation with and without the presence of natural
    habitats (coastal wetlands and marshes) under current and future (2050 SLR) scenarios
    for selected storm events. Analysis focused on three coastal counties in New Jersey
    adjacent to the JCNERR.
  12: Model formulation used to estimate the potential of natural habitats to relatively
    reduce flood depth; analysis based on the relative difference between two scenarios
    using the same model; analysis based on three storm events.
  14: Broad-scale modelling of coastal wetlands; DIVA Wetland Change Model; hydrodynamic
    and geospatial framework; choice experiment; field-based numerical model investigation
    of wave propagation across marshes.
More Notes:
  3: Study area includes JCNERR and portions of Ocean, Burlington, and Atlantic Counties
    in New Jersey. The JCNERR is a protected area with more than 45,000 hectares of
    terrestrial and estuarine ecosystems.
  5: The study focuses on modeling storm surge and wave impacts on coastal areas and
    habitats, considering the role of natural habitats in coastal resilience. It selects
    storms based on recommendations from protected area managers and uses the SLAMM
    model to project future habitat changes due to SLR. The study acknowledges limitations
    in current modeling approaches and focuses on improving parameterization.
  6: The study acknowledges uncertainties and limitations in projecting future SLR
    and coastal landscape or salt marshes response to the projected SLR. It utilizes
    available data and recommendations by natural resources managers of the JC NERR
    based on their natural habitats restoration initiatives to develop the future
    scenario.
  8: The table shows the simulated land cover change and the estimated flood depth
    and property damage changes from each storm event under current and future scenarios.
    The statistically significant increases are flagged.
  9: The analysis focuses on the JCNERR area and its findings might not be generalizable
    to other regions without considering local environmental conditions.
  10: The value of protective services for Sandy and the 50-year storm increased in
    the SLR scenario, but decreased for the 25-year storm. Results suggest that one
    square kilometer of natural habitats can reduce residential property damages in
    the study area from $34,000 to $53,000 per square kilometer under current conditions
    and from $7,000 to $138,000 per square kilometer under future conditions for the
    selected storm events.
  12: Study focuses on flood protection provided by natural habitats; Findings emphasize
    on primary data collection in coastal wetlands and marshes during storm events
    for improved quantification of their flood reduction capacity; The study analyzed
    only the protection to residential structures, which suggests that these ecosystem
    service values are conservative estimates.
  14: The research covers a range of methodologies and geographic locations (US Gulf
    Coast, Southeast Louisiana, Southern Thailand, Chesapeake Bay) indicating broad
    applicability but also the need for context-specific assessments.

Quantitative material:
  3: "Uses parcel-level property values to estimate avoided damages; A recent study\
    \ [39] suggested that wave setup contributed to 17% of the peak water level during\
    \ most of the hurricane events during 1988\u20132015 in the US coast."
  5: The study uses synthetic storms with a 4% ('25-year storm') and 2% ('50-year
    storm') probability of occurrence in any given year. It also considers a 400-year
    storm event (Hurricane Sandy).
  6: SLAMM estimated a total 0.1332m of SLR in the year 2050 for the study area. A
    1.7 millimeters per year of SLR is used based on the IPCC's Special Report on
    Emissions Scenarios A1F1. An average of 4 millimeters per year of accretion is
    applied in the model.
  7: Total marsh area is predicted to reduce by 5.4% due to SLR and marsh migration;
    transitional salt marshes and irregularly flooded marshes are predicted to decrease
    by around 38% and 36%, respectively.
  9: Coastal wetlands and marshes can lower flood elevation by a maximum of 0.2 to
    0.4 meters; averaged reduction in flood elevation and depth varies from 0.03 to
    0.06m; presence of natural habitats can reduce total property damage up to 13.8%
    under current conditions and up to 6.1% in future conditions; avoided damage ranges
    from $8,500,000 to $13,000,000 under current conditions and $1,500,000 to $32,000,000
    under 2050 conditions.
  10: Property damage with and without natural habitats present for different storm
    scenarios and SLR scenarios; Flood protection value in dollars; Percentage change
    in damages avoided; Unit value of flood protection services (dollars per square
    kilometer).
  12: Large difference between maximum and average reduction in flood elevation due
    to presence of the natural habitats.
  14: Studies quantify the attenuation of storm surge components by coastal wetlands,
    wave attenuation over saltmarshes, and the value of wetlands in protecting against
    storm surges.
