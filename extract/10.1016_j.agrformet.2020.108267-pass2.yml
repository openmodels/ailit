Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Minimum temperature, fluctuating temperatures above and below 0\xB0C, and windchill\
    \ during the cold period."
  2: Temperature and precipitation during the winter period; rainfall and temperature
    during the winter season; meteorological factors.
  3: Daily minimum and maximum temperatures, precipitation, wind velocity, solar radiation,
    vapor pressure deficit, and evapotranspiration are used to characterize winter
    harshness and identify cold periods (CP).
  4: Meteorological variables (Table 2, Table 3), including temperature-related metrics
    (minimum, mean, and maximum temperatures), precipitation, wind, and solar radiation,
    are used to predict survival risk.
  5: Cold periods, specifically related to variables like 'Colder' (likely referring
    to number of cold days), 'cET' (cumulative evapotranspiration), 'ncycle' (number
    of freeze-thaw cycles), 'Colder_pct' (percentage of cold days), 'maxTmean' (maximum
    mean temperature), and 'meanWindchill' (mean windchill).
  6: Meteorological survival clusters (poor, medium, high) defined by cold period
    (CP, mean temperature below 0oC) are impacting canola survival.
  7: "Meteorological variables during the cold period (CP), including Colder (5 days),\
    \ ncycle (24 cycles), cET (465 mm cumulative ET), meanWindchill (-3.6\u25E6C),\
    \ Colder_pct (3%), and maxTmean (13.4\u25E6C)."
  8: "Minimum temperature, fluctuations in temperature above or below 0\xB0C, and\
    \ wind chill temperature. Number of days with temperatures between -10\xB0C and\
    \ -15\xB0C."

    impacts.
Highlights:
  1: Meteorological variables related to minimum temperature, fluctuating temperatures,
    and windchill were the main factors accounting for winter kill. Areas of adaptation
    for current canola germplasm were defined. Four genotype survival groups were
    identified.
  2: Determine the area of adaptation of current winter canola germplasm based on
    winter survival.
  3: The study aims to estimate the contribution of genotype, environment, and their
    interaction to canola winter survival based on meteorological variables during
    the cold period.
  4: The study aims to estimate the area of adaptation of canola germplasm based on
    the risk of survival as predicted by meteorological variables.
  5: Identifies key meteorological variables that significantly influence canola survival
    during cold periods and shows regional differences in survival clusters across
    the US.
  6: Genotype by environment (GxE) interaction is an important determinant of survival,
    being twice as large as G. Environmental factors (E) explain the majority of the
    variation in winter canola survival.
  7: 'Four genotype-specific behaviors were identified: tolerant, semi-tolerant, semi-susceptible,
    and susceptible. Tolerant genotypes showed significantly greater survival (40%)
    in poor meteorological survival clusters compared to other groups (17-19%).'
  8: Identified key meteorological variables affecting winter canola survival. Determined
    areas with potential for near 100% winter survival. Found that broadly-adapted
    genotypes are semi-tolerant or semi-susceptible to winter kill.

    2000s, 2010s), and their type (open-pollinated or hybrid).

Methodology:
  1: A regression tree analysis was performed on a winter survival dataset from the
    National Winter Canola Variety Trials from 2003 until 2018 (190 site-years) and
    auxiliary meteorological data over the last 40 years. Probabilities of different
    winter survival conditions were calculated for 94 US sites.
  2: Analysis of a dataset compiled from the National Winter Canola Variety Trials
    (NWCVT).
  3: Daily weather data from Google Climate Engine (1979-2019) were used to create
    secondary weather variables, identify the beginning and end of the cold period,
    build a model to predict meteorological survival clusters, and predict the probability
    of occurrence over 40 years.  A series of analyses divided into seven steps were
    conducted to estimate the contribution of genotype (G), environment (E), and interaction
    (GxE) to the overall variance for canola winter survival (S).
  4: A multi-step process is used, including mixed models, cluster analysis (k-means),
    and conditional inference trees to model meteorological survival class (MSc) as
    a function of meteorological factors. Long-term daily weather records (1979-2019)
    are used.
  5: Uses a conditional inference tree to classify meteorological survival clusters
    based on summarized meteorological variables from 190 site-years. The analysis
    covers the period 1979-2019, with sites included in the National Winter Canola
    Variety Trial dataset.
  6: Mixed-effect models were used to analyze genotype survival across meteorological
    survival clusters. Pairwise comparisons were performed with alpha=0.05. Tree models
    and cluster analyses were also employed. Analyses were conducted in the R framework
    using packages lme4, partykit, and stats. The study only used years with a cold
    period (CP).
  7: A conditional inference tree was used to classify site-year cold periods (CPs)
    into seven terminal nodes based on meteorological variables. The model was used
    to classify each CP for all 94 sites during the 1979-2019 period.

More Notes:
  1: The research aims to identify meteorological factors underpinning winter canola
    survival, build probabilistic response models, and define areas of adaptation.
  2: Focuses on understanding how meteorological factors impact winter survival and
    yield to facilitate winter canola production in new areas.
  3: "The cold period (CP) is defined as the period when temperatures were below 0\xB0\
    C.  Windchill calculations were performed following the equation presented by\
    \ Osczevski and Bluestein (2005)."
  4: The conditional inference tree model uses maximum depth and alpha as hyperparameters,
    optimized via leave-one-out cross-validation. Three survival classes (poor, medium,
    and high) are defined using k-means clustering of environment BLUEs for survival.
  5: The decision tree visually represents how different meteorological conditions
    lead to varying levels of canola survival, which can provide insights into climate-related
    risks for canola production.
  6: Four distinct genotype survival behaviors across meteorological survival clusters
    were identified (tolerant, semi-tolerant, semi-susceptible, susceptible).
  7: The study uses data from the National Winter Canola Variety Trial. The distribution
    of different genotype survival groups varies geographically across the US, with
    latitude being a factor.
  10: The 'Genotype group' column suggests some genotypes are 'Semi-susceptible' to
    something. This list may be a part of a study on climate impacts on maize.

Quantitative material:
  1: "Cold periods were classified into three clusters with high (96%), medium (70%),\
    \ and low (28%) average plant winter survival. A map defines areas of adaptation,\
    \ and a large area south of 35\xB0N latitude in the US was identified with greater\
    \ potential for overwintering success. Four distinct genotype survival groups\
    \ were identified (tolerant, semi-tolerant, semi-susceptible, and susceptible)."
  2: Data from 2003 to 2018 across 94 unique sites, with auxiliary weather data for
    each site-year were assembled and analyzed.
  3: The study calculates various metrics related to temperature (minimum, mean, maximum,
    DeltaT), precipitation, wind velocity, solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit,
    and evapotranspiration during the cold period, including cumulative values, counts
    of days within specific temperature ranges, and percentages relative to the total
    days of winter duration.
  4: Table 3 provides summary statistics (minimum, mean, median, maximum, and coefficient
    of variation) for meteorological variables during the cold period and canola survival
    percentage.
  5: Provides proportions of site-years within each meteorological survival cluster
    (high, medium, and poor) at each node of the decision tree, represented by bar
    graphs. Pie charts show the proportion of cold periods classified into high, medium,
    and poor meteorological survival clusters over a 40-year period (1979-2019) for
    each site.
  6: G, E and GxE explained 3%, 71%, and 7% of the variation in winter canola survival,
    respectively. Model residuals account for 19%.
  7: Overall winter survival averaged 84%. Conditional inference tree model accuracy
    was 58% overall, with 48%, 40%, and 60% accuracy for poor, medium, and high meteorological
    survival clusters, respectively.
  8: Found that meteorological variables explained mean winter survival across 190
    site-years.
