Drivers of Risk:
  3: Pest outbreaks, changes in weather, decades of intensive production draining
    soil of organic matter (leading to vulnerability to drought and erosion), policies
    encouraging corn for ethanol, speculative investment instruments based on commodity
    prices, problems in logistics systems, natural disasters, global crops failure.
  6: Fluctuations in global grain reserves (carry-over stocks).
  7: Variation of country-level reserves; Extreme variability in food reserves (region
    to region and year to year); Food deficits and surpluses; Volatility at the regional
    level in terms of grain reserves; Increasing volatility of grain reserves
  15: The spatial variation of cereal stocks from 2005 to 2009, though the underlying
    drivers of this variation are not explicitly stated on this page.
  18: Over-production, collapsing grain prices, drought, other calamities, fluctuating
    commodity markets.
  20: Droughts and other crop failures, volatile international food prices, corruption
    and mismanagement, and policy advice from international financial institutions
    (e.g., IMF).
Highlights:
  3: The paper argues that the global food system is vulnerable to disruption due
    to factors like industrial monocultures, soil degradation, and destabilizing policies.
    Food storage is presented as a potential strategy to increase resilience against
    shocks that can disrupt people's access to food.
  6: Low global grain reserves may have contributed to the 2008 food price shock;
    there was an inverse relation between grain reserves and price between 1991 and
    2005.
  7: Grain stocks are inversely correlated with price between 1991 and 2005, but not
    since; Variability of country-level reserves may be increasing and growing more
    extreme; World's food system may be becoming more volatile; Current National Grain
    Reserves contain about 3 months worth of food
  15: North America (USA) shows a consistent cereal surplus, while many regions in
    Africa and parts of Asia show a deficit.
  18: The U.S. 'ever-normal granary' aimed to support farm prices and consumer access
    to affordable food using a USDA-managed grain reserve. It allowed farmers to store
    crops and use their value as collateral for loans when prices were low, and the
    government would hold grain until prices rose to protect consumers.
  20: Strategic grain reserves in Africa were intended to address market failures,
    smooth price volatility, complement the private sector, and prepare for food emergencies.
    However, mismanagement, corruption, and policy shifts (influenced by the 'Washington
    consensus') led to criticism and failures, such as the Malawi famine in 2001 where
    reserves were empty despite the need.
Methodology:
  3: 'Exploration of food storage as a strategic tool to build food system resilience,
    building on literature dealing with the resilience of social ecological systems.
    Attempts to answer four key questions: 1) Are grain reserves significant in determining
    food price? 2) How long will the current global reserves of grain last in the
    event of a global crops failure? 3) Is it the amount of reserves or their ownership
    that lead to resilience? 4) What policies can promote effective food reserves?'
  6: "Analysis of FAO data on year-end stocks of cereals; Comparison of global grain\
    \ reserves with the UN\u2019s food price index."
  7: Regression analysis where food price was used as the dependent variable and grain
    stocks was the explanatory variable (1991-2005 and since 2005); FAO cereal data
    used for calculations
More Notes:
  3: The paper highlights the shift from strategic grain reserves managed by countries/international
    bodies to reliance on less regulated private companies' commodity chains.
  6: The paper acknowledges that the FAO data on grain reserves is incomplete, as
    it does not include household-level food storage or food held in retail warehouses.
  15: The page highlights potential vulnerabilities to cereal shortages in specific
    geographical areas, which could be relevant for assessing the macroeconomic impact
    of climate-related disruptions to agriculture and the benefits of adaptation measures
    focused on food security. However, the paper does not explicitly link cereal stock
    variations to climate change or adaptation strategies on this specific page.
  18: The program was cancelled in the 1970s in favor of free market deregulation
    of agriculture.
  20: The paper emphasizes the role of public policy and international institutions
    in shaping food reserve policy and its effectiveness. It also points out the tension
    between maintaining reserves for emergencies and pressures to reduce government
    spending and embrace free-market principles.
No relevant information:
  9: This page primarily discusses the structure and vulnerabilities of the food supply
    chain, the concentration of power within it, and the lack of readily available
    data on food storage. While it touches on potential disruptions, it does not provide
    specific information on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, or any kind of cost/benefit
    analysis or quantitative information on the impact of those potential disruptions.
    It mostly highlights the lack of visibility into private food storage and the
    potential fragility of the 'just-in-time' food supply chain model.
  12: This page contains only a figure title and source information, making it impossible
    to extract any relevant information on the specified categories.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Food price stability and food security, particularly during production/distribution
    crises; political unrest tied to food prices; disruption of people's access to
    food.
  6: Food prices; potential impacts on national economies through price volatility.
  7: Relative market stability, especially in terms of rice price; Resilience of food
    system
  15: Implies impact on food security and potentially GDP through changes in cereal
    availability.
  18: Price stability for farmers (fair prices) and consumers (affordable food).
  20: Potentially lower food prices and greater food security for vulnerable populations
    during food emergencies.
Quantitative material:
  6: Global cereal reserves have generally ranged between 400 and 600 million tonnes
    annually (18-23% of total annual food use); stocks varied between 413 million
    tonnes (2007-8) and 565 million tonnes (2014-2015 forecast); largest global stock
    in 2013-14 when the world had a cereal reserve that equaled 23.3% of its utilization;
    the lowest level since the early 1990s was 18.4% in 2007-8.
  7: Overall grain stocks are significant predictor of price and that stocks and prices
    are inversely correlated between 1991 and 2005; Since 2005 food stocks are not
    significant in explaining price; In 2014, the world's reserves could cover ~3
    months of consumption
  15: Provides visual (map-based) quantitative data on cereal stock levels (surplus/deficit)
    across countries from 2005-2009.
