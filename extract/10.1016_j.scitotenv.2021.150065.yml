  3: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate hazards (floods, droughts, storms), underlying societal vulnerability
  8: Climate-related hazards (storms, droughts, floods) and vulnerability (susceptibility,
    lack of coping capacity, lack of adaptive capacity), exposure.
  10: Floods, storms, and droughts (climate-related hazard events)
  12: Hazard events, vulnerability (as measured by INFORMv, WRIv, and a combined index).
Highlights:
  2: Countries with high vulnerability have significantly higher mortality rates from
    climate-related disasters. Priority should be given not just to those regions
    that are likely to face more severe climate hazards in the future but also to
    those confronted with high vulnerability already.
  8: Vulnerability correlates with mortality and the number of people affected by
    hazard events. Higher vulnerability is associated with greater mortality and more
    people affected. Vulnerability also correlates with economic losses but shows
    an inverse relationship.
  10: Mortality rates from extreme weather events are highest in Central Africa and
    South Asia, reflecting higher vulnerability in these regions.
  12: Countries with wealth and exposed capital assets experience the highest absolute
    economic losses, while the most vulnerable countries or least developed countries
    have higher mortality per hazard event. Low-income countries experience disproportionately
    high losses as a proportion of GDP.
Methodology:
  2: Review of global vulnerability index systems (WorldRiskIndex and INFORM index)
    and new analysis of linkages between vulnerability and disaster outcomes. Statistical
    validation methods used. Analysis of the link between indicators, data, and the
    indicandum. Internal validation (reliability and sensitivity) and external validation
    (how vulnerability metrics explain disaster outcomes).
  3: The paper focuses on the validity of global comparative vulnerability indicator
    systems, statistically reliability of indicators and index approaches, the relationship
    between these vulnerability assessments and actual loss data from past disasters
    due to climate influenced hazards, blind spots and missing data, the extent to
    which global vulnerability approaches can be used to inform adaptation planning
    and priority issues for further research.
  8: Correlation analysis between vulnerability indices (WRIv, INFORMv) and hazard-induced
    losses (mortality, number of people affected, economic losses) at national and
    regional levels (UNSD regions). Uses EM-DAT database for mortality data.
  10: "Analysis uses data from the Emergency Events Database\u2014EM-DAT (https://www.emdat.be/database)\
    \ for storms, floods and droughts hazards between 2010 and 2019."
  12: Analysis of economic damages and affected populations based on vulnerability
    classifications using INFORMv, WRIv, and a combined index.
More Notes:
  2: The paper focuses on validating vulnerability assessments at the global scale.
    Vulnerability is defined as the propensity and predisposition of a system to be
    adversely affected by external shocks. Systemic societal vulnerability refers
    to characteristics of society that are largely independent of the specific climatic
    hazard.
  3: The paper examines the WorldRiskIndex (WRI) and the INFORM index. The WRI is
    composed of exposure, susceptibility, lack of coping capacity and lack of adaptive
    capacity. The INFORM index consists of three components of risk, namely hazard
    and exposure, vulnerability and lack of coping capacity.
  8: The study uses mortality per hazard event as a measure of disaster outcome. Mortality
    data may be underestimated in low-income countries.
  10: Vulnerability indices from WRI and INFORM are correlated with mortality and
    economic losses.  The paper finds statistically significant correlations between
    vulnerability indices and mortality per event, people affected per hazard event,
    and economic losses per event.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Mortality per hazard event (floods, drought, and storms)
  8: Mortality per hazard event, number of people affected per hazard event, economic
    losses per event.
  10: No relevant information
  12: Economic damages per event are higher in countries with low vulnerability than
    in very highly vulnerable countries. Economic losses (in the last ten years) as
    a percentage of GDP is higher in very high vulnerable countries compared to very
    low vulnerable countries as per INFORMv. Some countries that are categorized as
    very low or low vulnerable face relatively high economic losses as a percentage
    of GDP.
Quantitative material:
  2: Mortality per hazard event from floods, drought and storms is 15 times higher
    for countries ranked as highly vulnerable compared to those classified as low
    vulnerable.
  8: 'Positive and significant correlation between vulnerability values of WRIv, INFORMv,
    and combined indices with mortality and number of people affected per hazard event.
    Negative and significant correlation between vulnerability and economic losses
    per event (stronger at regional level: r = 0.500, p = 0.01).'
  10: Mortality per event is 15 and 7 times higher in countries with very high vulnerability
    compared to countries with very low and low vulnerability, respectively.
  12: Economic damages per event are 16 times lower in very highly vulnerable countries
    compared to countries with very low vulnerability (combined index). Very highly
    vulnerable countries have 18 times and 8 times less economic damages per event
    to report compared to countries categorized as having very low vulnerability (WRIv
    and INFORMv indices). The number of affected people per hazard event was about
    11 times higher in countries categorized as very high vulnerable compared to very
    low vulnerable (combined index).
