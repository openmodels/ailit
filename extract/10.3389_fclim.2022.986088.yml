Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increasing extreme temperatures and storms in arid and semi-arid zones
  9: Average temperature, annual (t-1); Average precipitation, annual (t-1); Drought
    (t-1); Earthquake (t-1); Landslide (t-1); Storm (t-1); Fire (t-1); Extreme temperature
    (t-1); Flood (t-1)
  10: Extreme poverty, average annual temperature, average annual precipitation, drought,
    earthquake, landslide, storm, fire, extreme temperature, and flood.
  11: Climatic events such as average temperature, precipitation, droughts, earthquakes,
    landslides, storms, fires, extreme temperatures, and floods are analyzed as drivers
    impacting bilateral international migration per capita.
  12: The drivers of risk include conflict, average temperature, average precipitation,
    drought, earthquake, landslide, storm, fire, extreme temperature, and flood. These
    climate events are interacted with conflict to assess their combined impact.
  13: Climatic events like storms, droughts, wildfires, and increases in average temperature
    impact international migration patterns, particularly from arid and conflict-ridden
    areas.
  14: "Higher average temperatures are related to a rise in out-migration in all country\
    \ groups except for the upper-middle income countries; earthquakes are linked\
    \ to more out-migration in almost all country groups, except for the upper-middle\
    \ income countries; poverty seems to decrease out-migration, whereas, for con\uFB02\
    ict, the opposite is the case; climatic events impact di\uFB00erently out-migration\
    \ depending on the climatic zones."
Highlights:
  1: Increasing extreme temperatures and storms in arid and semi-arid zones act as
    triggers of bilateral migration from South to North and that the estimated effects
    are non-negligible.
  9: An increase in average temperatures is related to a rise in out-migration in
    the total sample and all country groups except for upper-middle-income countries.
    Drought has a negative impact on migration. The impact of other climate-related
    variables varies with the country sub-sample.
  10: Extreme poverty, average temperature, and the interaction between average temperature
    and poverty are consistently significant predictors of out-migration across different
    economic sub-samples. Precipitation is positively related to out-migration, while
    storms have a negative impact on out-migration (total and upper-middle income
    countries) with varying significance across sub-samples.
  11: The study finds droughts typically reduce out-migration due to increased poverty
    and decreased availability of resources to migrate; extreme events have a varying
    impact across different climatic zones.
  12: Several climate event/conflict interactions are statistically significant in
    specific income groups. For example, in LDCs, the interaction between average
    temperature and conflict, extreme temperature and conflict is highly significant.
    Also, in Lower-Middle income countries, Drought and Conflict are significant drivers.
    For Upper-Middle income countries Storm and Fire when combined with Conflict show
    significant changes.
  13: Rising temperatures and droughts lead to increased migration from arid and conflict-ridden
    areas, while storms promote migration from tropical zones.
  14: Higher average temperatures are related to a rise in out-migration in all country
    groups except for the upper-middle income countries; an increase in average temperatures
    is related to increased out-migration in the overall sample but to diminished
    emigration from tropical countries; an increase in average temperatures correlates
    with reduced emigration when controlling for poverty.
Methodology:
  1: A gravity model is estimated using panel data techniques to investigate the link
    between climatic events and bilateral migration from countries in the Global South
    to OECD countries.
  9: PPML estimation with dyadic and destination-year fixed effects. Standard errors
    are clustered at the origin-destination level. Results are presented for the total
    sample, Non-OECD countries, Least Developed Countries (LDC), Lower-middle income
    countries, and Upper-middle income countries.
  10: The analysis applies PPML (Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood) regression with
    dyadic and destination-year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the
    origin-destination level. The time frame is not explicitly specified but uses
    one-year lagged values (t-1) for explanatory variables.
  11: The analysis uses PPML estimation to assess the impact of climatic events on
    bilateral international migration per capita, including dyadic and destination-year
    fixed effects, and standard errors clustered at the origin-destination level.
  12: The analysis uses a regression model to assess the impact of climate events
    and conflict on bilateral international migration per capita. The results are
    applicable for understanding how climate events, in the presence of conflict,
    can influence migration patterns across different country income groups. The data
    is lagged by one period (t-1).
  13: Analysis is performed using PPML estimation results with bilateral migrant inflow
    per origin country population as the dependent variable and includes dyadic and
    destination x year fixed effects.
  14: "This study uses bilateral migration data to analyze the e\uFB00ect of climatic\
    \ variables on international population displacements to OECD countries."
More Notes:
  1: The analysis considers climatic zones, income levels, and incidence of conflict
    as factors influencing migration.
  9: Negative values of average temperature are not considered. The joint significance
    of climatic variables and extreme events variables are also reported (p-values).
  10: The study examines the impact of climate events and poverty on international
    migration, differentiating effects across countries with different income levels.
    The interaction terms between poverty and climate variables are included to assess
    whether the effect of climate variables on migration differs depending on the
    level of poverty.
  12: The study focuses on migration as an outcome variable, which is an indirect
    measure of macroeconomic or fiscal impact, but can be linked to effects on labor
    supply, remittances, and demand for social services.
  14: The increasing frequency of climatic events and the related increasing population
    movements generate a pressing need to increase coordination at the international
    level in relation to SDG17.
