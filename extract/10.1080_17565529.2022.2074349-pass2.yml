Drivers of Risk:
  2: Higher temperatures negatively impact the working hours of low-skilled labour,
    especially among women in high-exposure sectors.
  4: "Weekly maximum temperature increases above 30\xB0C."
  5: Changes in temperature, particularly maximum temperature, and to a lesser extent
    precipitation.
  7: Weekly maximum temperature, cumulative warming over a year, cumulative precipitation
    in the 12 months before the interview
  8: Cumulative precipitation, maximum temperature
  9: Climate change affects labour market dynamics through temperature rise impacting
    labour availability and productivity, particularly in vulnerable sectors.
  10: Climate change impacts on labor supply (considering four different RCP scenarios);
    temperature changes
  11: Climate change (rising temperatures, climate-induced damages), differential
    impacts on the supply of male and female labor, sectoral productivity damages.
  14: Daily maximum temperature; Climate change impacts (projected)
  15: Climate change impacts to productivity captured by productivity factors Da and
    Db, which are functions of mean temperature.
  16: Maximum temperatures affecting labor supply; average temperature affecting labor
    demand; Sectoral productivity impacted by mean temperature rise.
  17: Mean temperature changes impacting productivity in high- and low-exposure sectors;
    Climate change impacts on the demand and supply sides of the labor market, but
    the main results are driven by the change in labor supply.
  18: Different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) representing varying
    levels of greenhouse gas concentrations drive the projected changes in supply
    and wage ratios. Climate change impacts are implicitly considered drivers of changes
    in the supply factor.
  19: Climate change impacts on the supply side of labor (differentiated by skill
    and gender) and the demand side of the economy.
Highlights:
  2: Climate-induced reduction in labour availability increases relative wages for
    low-skilled female labour and reduces the wage gap between male and female labour
    in high-exposure sectors.
  4: Weekly labour supply in South Africa is more responsive to weekly maximum temperature
    instead of mean temperature.
  5: Increases in maximum temperature are likely to have a greater adverse impact
    on female working hours compared to male counterparts due to lower optimal temperature
    maximizing female labor supply. Labor supply is maximized at different temperatures
    for high vs. low exposure sectors.
  7: ''
  8: Cumulative precipitation has a positive impact on total income. Optimal temperatures
    maximizing labour supply differ between male and female workers, and between skill
    levels.
  9: Long-term wage inequality is driven by climate change impacts on labour availability,
    while short-term wage shocks can also result from sectoral productivity changes.
  10: High-skilled labor supply is insensitive to temperature changes; low-skilled
    female labor is particularly vulnerable in high-exposure sectors; climate change
    decreases the wage gap between high-skilled and low-skilled labor, more noticeably
    among female laborers.
  11: Climate change reduces the relative availability of low-skilled labor in high-exposure
    sectors, translating into a spike in prices and a long-term increase in relative
    wages of this group, especially female labor, closing the gender pay gap.  However,
    the overall impact of climate change on the economy remains negative due to damages
    to labor availability and sectoral productivity, potentially shrinking output
    per adult by up to 11%.
  14: Temperature has a non-linear impact on labor supply, with both positive and
    negative effects depending on the temperature range. The effect varies by skill
    level and gender. Parents make decisions regarding the number of children and
    their education level based on consumption, future wages, and climate change impacts.
  15: Climate change affects productivity differently in high-exposure and low-exposure
    sectors. The ratio of wages of children is proportional to the ratio of child
    rearing. The wage ratio of male to female labor in each sector is proportional
    to their supply ratio.
  16: Climate change impacts both the supply of and the demand for labor in both sectors.
    Damages to labor availability are related to the maximum temperature instead of
    mean temperature.
  17: 'The main results are driven by the change in labor supply. Productivity factor
    depends on mean temperature. Climate change is projected to have negative impacts
    on output per adult, with the magnitude varying depending on the climate scenario.
    Figure A2 illustrates this impact. '
  18: Climate change is projected to affect the supply of skilled labor differently
    for men and women. Wage ratios between high-skilled and low-skilled labor, and
    between men and women within each skill level, are also projected to change under
    different climate scenarios.
  19: In the climate demand model, wage ratios remain constant over time and across
    different RCP scenarios because they are only a function of fixed child-rearing
    costs and supply factors. However, overall damages to the output per capita are
    comparable to the climate supply model.
Methodology:
  2: The analysis uses a structural model calibrated with empirical evidence and incorporates
    findings into an overlapping generations (OLG) model.
  4: Econometric analysis of longitudinal survey data (NIDS) in South Africa using
    a truncated Poisson model and panel data techniques with fixed effects, clustering
    standard errors at the individual level. The analysis is applicable to the period
    2008-2017.
  5: Econometric analysis using regression models (Equation 1) to estimate the marginal
    effects of temperature changes on labor supply, focusing on household-level data
    in South Africa. OLG model calibrated with marginal effects from the econometric
    analysis and global estimates of productivity loss. Robustness tests include differentiating
    by exposure level and using a log transformation of weekly hours worked.
  7: ''
  8: 2SLS regression analysis of South African household-level data with cumulative
    precipitation in the previous 12 months used as an instrument for income. The
    model is an overlapping generation (OLG) framework with two periods, two genders,
    two skill levels, and two economic sectors (high-exposure and low-exposure). Fixed
    effects are included.
  9: The analysis utilizes an overlapping generations (OLG) model focusing on education
    decisions, wage dynamics, and labour market adjustments, projecting climate impacts
    on labour for each generation.
  10: 'Development of two cases: Reference case (climate conditions remain unchanged)
    and climate change damages to labour supply under four RCP scenarios; Examines
    the effect of different climate pathways on labour supply and wage differences'
  11: Calibration of an Overlapping Generations (OLG) model to study the impact of
    climate and socioeconomic changes on the gender pay gap. Uses empirical evidence,
    including binned and 2SLS regressions. Examines historical evidence from a nationally
    representative longitudinal survey in South Africa.
  14: "The paper uses individual survey data to estimate the loss in labor supply\
    \ due to increases in mean temperature. A theoretical model of utility maximization,\
    \ incorporating consumption and children\u2019s future wages is developed. The\
    \ impact of temperature on labor supply is incorporated into the model as a \u2018\
    supply factor\u2019 ranging from 0-100%."
  15: A computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is used with a focus on labor market
    dynamics and sectoral production functions, specified as constant elasticity of
    substitution (CES) functions. It incorporates differentiated impacts of climate
    change on high-exposure and low-exposure sectors. The model is dynamic, with technological
    change evolving exogenously (A13).
  16: Calibration of a model using initial wages, temperature data in year 2000, concentration
    projections from four RCP scenarios, and SSP2 projection of skill ratio in year
    2100 to obtain wage ratios and supply factor values. A quadratic relationship
    between sectoral damages and mean temperature is used. The model is solved simultaneously
    for the number of children of each gender and skill level, by temperature given
    from RCP projections.
  17: An overlapping generations (OLG) model is used. Calibration of the model is
    based on historical data. The model incorporates climate impacts on both demand
    and supply of labor. Equations are presented that govern fertility and education
    decisions to determine the labor force composition. Climate change supply and
    climate change demand models are used.
  18: The analysis uses a 'climate supply model' to project the impact of climate
    change on gender pay gaps, focusing on the supply side of the labor market. The
    applicability of the results depends on the assumptions and structure of this
    specific model.
  19: 'The authors construct two alternative models: a climate supply model (only
    considers impacts on the supply side) and a climate demand model (only considers
    impacts on the demand side). The models analyze the impact of climate change under
    four RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5).'
More Notes:
  2: The paper calls for adaptation policies that leverage the potential benefits
    of climate change in reducing gender inequality and empowering women.
  4: The study differentiates impacts by gender and by exposure level of the sector
    (high, low, services).
  5: Analysis focuses on labour supply, not equilibrium effects of wage adjustments.
    Unemployment is not considered as an alternative to decreased working hours.
  8: The model incorporates gender-specific labour force participation, gender-specific
    climate impacts, and gender-specific outcomes. The model considers both the availability
    of labour and the productivity of production, each of which is impacted by climate
    change. The analysis is based on South African data.
  10: Empirical analysis was performed in Section 2 of the paper.
  11: The model assumes a clear labor division (high-exposure sector employs low-skilled
    labor; low-exposure sector employs high-skilled labor). The study does not account
    for the potential impacts of future gender pay equalizing policies. The analysis
    focuses on South Africa.
  14: "The model incorporates two economic sectors: a high-exposure sector (e.g.,\
    \ agriculture) using low-skilled labor, and a low-exposure sector (e.g., manufacturing)\
    \ using high-skilled labor. The model accounts for the \u2018quantity\u2013quality\
    \ trade-off\u2019 in child rearing."
  15: The model is calibrated to South African data (year 2000) for some parameters.
    The elasticity of substitution between male and female labor is assumed to be
    equal to 2.9 in both sectors.
  17: The paper utilizes Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to project impacts
    over time (Figure A2).
  18: The analysis focuses on the labor supply side and may not capture all the factors
    influencing wage outcomes. The specific mechanisms through which climate change
    affects labor supply and wages are not explicitly detailed on this page.
  19: The analysis suggests that climate change impacts on the supply side of labor
    do not significantly alter wage ratios within this specific model framework. The
    climate demand model assumes productivity factors are constant.

  4: Equation (1) presents an econometric framework relating labour supply to temperature,
    individual covariates, household income, and fixed effects.
  5: "Optimal weekly maximum temperatures for maximizing labor supply are identified:\
    \ Male workers in high-exposure sector: 27.6\xB0C; Female workers in high-exposure\
    \ sector: 26.7\xB0C; All workers in low-exposure sector: 28.6\xB0C; Labor supply\
    \ in the high-exposure sector is maximized at 26.3\xB0C."
  7: ''
  8: "Optimal temperature maximizing labour supply for low-skilled male workers is\
    \ 25.3\u25E6C, for low-skilled female workers 24.3\u25E6C, for high-skilled male\
    \ workers 26.5\u25E6C, and for high-skilled female workers 25.9\u25E6C."
  10: Projections of climate change impacts on gender pay gap in South Africa under
    four RCP scenarios; ratio of supply factor for high-skilled male to female; ratio
    of supply factor for low-skilled male to female; wage ratio of male high-skilled
    to low-skilled labour; wage ratio of female high-skilled to low-skilled labour;
    wage ratio of high-skilled male to female labour and wage ratio of low-skilled
    male to female labour.
  11: Under RCP8.5, the wage ratio of high-skilled to low-skilled female labor reduces
    by about 5% from 1.32 in 2000 to 1.24 in 2100; for male labor, it reduces by just
    2% from 1.39 in 2000 to 1.36 in 2100.  Climate change could shrink total economic
    output per adult by up to 11% depending on the future RCP scenario.
  14: Table A1 presents coefficients from regressions modeling the non-linear relationship
    between temperature (in bins of daily maximum temperature) and labor supply for
    different skill and gender groups. These coefficients are used to estimate the
    loss in labor supply due to increases in mean temperature.
  15: Equations provided to calculate labor supply (A15), wages (A16-A19), wage ratios
    (A20, A21), labor ratios (A22, A23), the relationship between high and low exposure
    sector wages (A24, A25), and production outputs (A11, A12).  The parameters za
    = 0.61 and zb = 0.63 are calculated based on wage and skill ratios in South Africa
    in year 2000.
  16: "Productivity factor reaches its peak at 21.1\xB0C (high-exposure sector) and\
    \ 17.4\xB0C (low-exposure sector) with a maximum productivity loss of 90%."
  17: "Table A2 provides parameter values used in an OLG model, including elasticity\
    \ of substitution between male and female labor (\u03B7 = 2.900), share of male\
    \ labor in high- (za = 0.610) and low-exposure sectors (zb = 0.630), elasticity\
    \ of substitution between goods (\u03B5 = 0.500), consumption share of goods from\
    \ the high-exposure sector (\u03B8 = 0.275), child rearing costs, total parenting\
    \ time (\u03B3 = 0.400), and annual growth rates of technology in the low- (gb\
    \ = 0.010) and high-exposure sectors (ga = 0.089). Figure A1(b) shows productivity\
    \ factors for high- and low-exposure sectors as functions of mean temperature.\
    \ Figure A2 shows the relative change in output per adult compared to a reference\
    \ case without climate change."
  18: The graphs provide quantitative projections of supply factor ratios and wage
    ratios between different skill levels and genders under four RCP scenarios (2.6,
    4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) from 2000 to 2100.
  19: Figure A2 (mentioned in the text) shows overall damages to output per capita,
    which are comparable between the climate supply and climate demand models. Figures
    A4 (a) to (f) provide quantitative information on wage ratios under different
    RCP scenarios from 2000 to 2100.
