Drivers of Risk:
  1: Persistent changes in temperature above or below historical norms.
  2: Deviations of temperature and precipitation from their long-term moving-average
    historical norms (climate).
  3: Persistent temperature increases and climate variability impact economic growth,
    affecting both poor and rich countries.
  5: Deviations of temperature and precipitation from historical norms.
  6: Changes in temperature and precipitation relative to historical norms
  7: Weather shocks, specifically temperature changes from the moving-average norm
  8: Persistent increases in annual temperatures above historical norms or thresholds.
  9: Changes in temperature relative to its historical norm
  10: Increases in average global temperature, climate variability, and delays in
    adaptation.
  11: Annual increases in temperature deviating from historical norms, climate variability
  12: Persistent increases in temperatures based on RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
    Climate variability (Table 7).
Highlights:
  1: Marginal effects of temperature shocks vary across climates and income groups;
    abiding by the Paris Agreement substantially mitigates GDP losses.
  2: A series of positive (or negative) weather shocks has a long-term negative effect
    on per capita GDP growth.
  3: All countries experience GDP per capita losses under high-emission scenarios;
    adaptation reduces but does not eliminate negative growth effects.
  5: Persistent deviations of temperature from historical norms have negative effects
    on long-run economic growth. Bias correction is important to avoid underestimating
    cumulative effects of climate change. Permanent deviations of precipitation from
    their historical norms do not affect long-term growth.
  6: The core finding is that deviations in temperature and precipitation from historical
    norms have a negative impact on per capita real GDP growth. The magnitude of this
    impact varies depending on the specification and estimation method. The effects
    of adaptation may have been offset by structural changes to the economy or that
    adaptation is not keeping pace with the unprecedented rate of global warming.
  7: No statistically significant differential effects of climate change on poor versus
    rich nations or hot versus cold countries were found.
  8: Negative growth effects of weather shocks are more severe in hot countries compared
    to cold countries, but impacts are negative in both climates.
  9: "The estimated coefficient \u0302\U0001D703\U0001D6E5|\u0303\U0001D447\U0001D456\
    \U0001D461(\U0001D45A)| represents the long-run effect of climate change on per\
    \ capita real GDP growth."
  10: Climate change can lead to substantial output losses, especially with persistent
    temperature increases and high climate variability. Adaptation can reduce negative
    economic effects, but is unlikely to offset them entirely.
  11: Persistent changes in temperature above time-varying norms has long-term negative
    impacts on economic growth; Negative long-run growth effects are prevalent in
    all countries but vary across climates and income groups; Adaptation is unlikely
    to entirely offset the negative growth effects; Abiding by the Paris Agreement
    objective would go a long way in limiting economic losses from climate change
  12: Provides estimates of GDP per capita loss for several countries and regions
    under different climate scenarios and time horizons, highlighting potential economic
    impacts of climate change. Table 7 highlights role of climate variability
Methodology:
  1: Analysis uses a stochastic growth model with panel data set of 174 countries
    from 1960 to 2014; considers deviations of temperature and precipitation from
    long-term historical norms.
  2: The paper develops a theoretical growth model that links deviations of temperature
    and precipitation from their long-term moving-average historical norms to per
    capita real output growth, and uses a half-panel Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE) estimator
    to deal with potential biases.
  3: Empirical regressions linking temperature changes to income growth, counterfactual
    exercises projecting temperature impact on GDP under different emission scenarios.
  5: Panel ARDL regression with fixed effects (FE) and half-panel Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE)
    estimator. Focus is on long-run estimates. Uses lag order of 4 for all variables/countries.
    Climate norms constructed as moving averages of the past 20, 30, and 40 years.
  6: 'The analysis uses a panel data regression with country fixed effects (FE) and
    a half-panel Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE) estimator to correct for bias. The model examines
    the impact of deviations in temperature and precipitation from historical norms
    on per capita real GDP growth from 1960 to 2014. Two specifications are used:
    one including both temperature and precipitation variables, and another including
    only temperature.'
  7: ARDL specification; panel data models with interactive terms to capture differential
    effects for poor/rich and hot/cold countries; Half-Panel Jackknife Mean Group
    (HPJ-MG) estimator.
  8: Counterfactual analysis using HPJ-FE estimates based on ARDL specification, comparing
    GDP growth under no change and increased temperature scenarios.
  9: The analysis uses a half-panel Jackknife mean-group estimator to estimate the
    impact of temperature changes on per capita real GDP growth. Two specifications
    are used, one excluding and one including the lagged world real GDP per capita
    growth rate. The models relate changes in the log of real GDP per capita to historical
    temperature norms.
  10: Half-panel Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE) procedure with ARDL equation using data from
    174 countries over the period 1960-2014. A historical temperature norm is constructed
    based on moving averages of the past 30 years. Analysis is performed under RCP
    2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios compared to a historical trend scenario (1960-2014).
  11: Panel data analysis with heterogeneous effects across countries, counterfactual
    exercises of temperature increases under mitigated and unmitigated scenarios during
    2015-2100, allows for non-linearity, and implicit model of adaptation.
  12: The analysis considers persistent increases in temperatures and calculates PPP
    GDP weighted averages to estimate GDP per capita loss.
More Notes:
  1: Temperature effects are statistically significant, but no significant effects
    are found for precipitation changes.
  2: The paper distinguishes between level and growth effects, considers asymmetric
    weather effects, and tests for differential impacts of weather shocks across climates
    and income groups. It also allows for country-specific and time-varying climate
    thresholds and introduces an implicit model of adaptation.
  5: The study uses a panel of 174 countries with an average time dimension of approximately
    38 years. They re-estimate their preferred model over different time windows to
    investigate adaptation.
  7: The paper explores the heterogeneity of climate change effects across climates
    and income groups. Adaptation is mentioned but the paper's analysis is counterfactual
    given the current state of adaptation.
  9: The authors assume temperature shocks are serially uncorrelated, Gaussian random
    variables. They acknowledge that their assumption about volatility is conservative
    and likely underestimates the adverse effects of temperature increases. They use
    IPCC projections under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios for future temperature values.
  10: The economic effects estimated in the study are larger than those obtained in
    existing studies in the literature.
  11: The size of income effects varies significantly across countries depending on
    the pace of temperature increases and variability of climate conditions.
  12: The parameters h and m are used in the calculation, with h representing the
    years 2030, 2050, and 2100 and m taking values of 20, 30, and 40.  The paper also
    considers the role of climate variability in affecting GDP loss under the RCP
    8.5 scenario.

Quantitative material:
  1: "A persistent increase in average global temperature by 0.04\xB0C per year reduces\
    \ world real GDP per capita by more than 7% by 2100; abiding by the Paris Agreement\
    \ could reduce the loss to about 1%."
  2: The study covers 174 countries over the period 1960 to 2014.

    C annual temperature rise; global GDP per capita potentially drops 7.22% by 2100\
    \ under RCP 8.5."
  5: "A 0.01\xB0C annual increase in temperature above its historical norm reduces\
    \ real GDP per capita growth by 0.0577 percentage points per year. A 0.01\xB0\
    C annual decrease in temperature below its historical norm reduces real GDP per\
    \ capita growth by 0.0505 percentage points per year."
  6: "Table 1 and Table 2 show estimated coefficients (\u0302\U0001D703) representing\
    \ the long-run effects of climate change (temperature and precipitation) on per\
    \ capita real GDP growth. These coefficients are negative and often statistically\
    \ significant, indicating a negative impact of climate change on economic growth.\

    deviations, especially when lagged world output growth is included.
  9: Table 4 provides mean group estimates of the long-run effects of climate change
    on per capita real GDP growth from 1960-2014 for various country groupings (all
    countries, cold, temperate/hot, poor, rich) and using different historical norms
    (m=20, 30, 40) and specifications.
  10: "Under RCP 8.5 and m=30, real per capita output reduces by 0.80%, 2.51%, and\
    \ 7.22% in 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. For the same scenario, the income\
    \ losses vary between 0.50 and 1.20 percent, 1.53 and 3.77 percent, and 4.35 and\
    \ 10.52 percent in 2030, 2050 and 2100, respectively. Limiting temperature increase\
    \ to 0.01\xB0C per annum (RCP 2.6) substantially reduces losses. Allowing temperature\
    \ increases to affect the variability of temperature shocks (RCP 8.5 and m=30)\
    \ almost doubles the GDP losses at the global level by 2100 to 13.11 percent.\
    \ The United States losses are likely to be 70 percent higher if there is temperature\
    \ variability compared to the baseline counterfactual scenario."
  11: "A 0.01 \u25E6C annual deviation in temperature from historical norm reduces\
    \ long-term income growth by 0.0543 percentage points per year; RCP 8.5 scenario\
    \ reduces world's real GDP per capita by 7 percent by 2100; Country-specific climate\
    \ variability increases with temperature increases under RCP8.5 scenario would\
    \ almost double losses to 13 percent by 2100; Paris Agreement limits global income\
    \ loss to 1 percent by 2100 under RCP 2.6."
