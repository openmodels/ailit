Drivers of Risk:
  1: Persistent changes in temperature above or below historical norms impact economic
    outcomes, but precipitation changes do not show significant effects.
  2: Deviations of temperature and precipitation from long-term moving-average historical
    norms impact economic growth.
  3: Temperature changes that deviate from historical norms, particularly persistent
    increases.
  4: Temperature and precipitation relative to their historical norms per annum, specifically
    positive and negative deviations.
  5: Deviations of temperature and precipitation from historical norms.
  6: Changes in temperature and precipitation relative to their historical norms.
  7: The analysis considers temperature shocks and changes as the primary drivers
    impacting economic outcomes.
  8: Persistent increases in annual temperatures above their norms (or thresholds).
  9: "The primary driver of risk is changes in temperature relative to historical\
    \ norms, denoted as \u0303\U0001D447\U0001D456\U0001D461(\U0001D45A). The analysis\
    \ considers different historical norms (m = 20, 30, 40 years)."
  10: The shocks impacting outcomes include significant increases in average global
    temperatures and climate variability, which affect productivity, health, infrastructure,
    and supply chains.
  11: Annual increases in temperatures, temperature deviations from historical norms,
    climate variability
  12: Persistent increases in temperatures based on the RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.

  11: GDP per capita loss by 2100
  12: Percent loss in GDP per capita by 2030, 2050, and 2100 under different climate
    scenarios.
Highlights:
  1: The paper suggests that the negative impacts of climate change on economic growth
    are significant and varied across countries, with potential GDP per capita losses
    globally reaching 13 percent if climate variability increases.
  2: Positive or negative weather shocks have a long-term negative effect on per capita
    GDP growth.
  3: Under RCP 8.5, U.S. GDP per capita loss is estimated at 10.52% by 2100; adaptation
    can reduce but not completely offset these long-term negative effects.
  4: Increases in temperature are generally projected to negatively affect GDP. Different
    countries may experience varying degrees of GDP loss or gain depending on whether
    they are classified as 'hot' or 'cold' countries.
  5: Long-run economic growth is adversely affected when temperature deviates from
    its time-varying historical norm persistently. Deviations of precipitation variables
    from their historical norms are not statistically significant. Half-panel Jackknife
    FE (HPJ-FE) estimates are robust to alternative ways of measuring historical temperature.
  6: The long-run effects of temperature deviations on per capita real GDP growth
    are generally negative and statistically significant.  Precipitation effects are
    less consistent and often not statistically significant.
  7: Finds that the coefficients of temperature shock effects on poor versus rich
    and hot versus cold countries are not statistically significant.
  8: Persistent temperature deviations from historical norms negatively affect long-run
    per capita GDP growth.  Negative growth effects of weather shocks may be less
    severe in cold climates. Poor countries are disproportionately affected by weather
    shocks, but rich countries are not immune. Lagged world output growth accounts
    for global output trends interacting with climate.
  9: The analysis finds a statistically significant negative impact of temperature
    increases on per capita real GDP growth. The magnitude of the impact varies across
    different groups of countries, with larger negative effects generally observed
    for temperate/hot and poor countries. Inclusion of the lagged world GDP growth
    rate generally increases the magnitude of the negative impacts.
  10: RCP 8.5 without mitigation leads to substantial GDP losses globally, with significant
    variability across countries. Mitigation policies under RCP 2.6 substantially
    reduce these losses, but adaptation alone is unlikely to fully offset the impacts.
  11: Persistent changes in temperature above time-varying norms have long-term negative
    impacts on economic growth; Negative long-run growth effects are prevalent in
    all countries but to different degrees; Income losses are sizable even in cold
    climates; Adaptation is unlikely to fully offset negative growth effects; Paris
    Agreement objective significantly limits economic losses.
  12: The analysis forecasts substantial GDP per capita losses by 2050 and 2100, especially
    under the RCP 8.5 scenario, with the United States facing a potential 14.32% loss
    by 2100.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis uses a stochastic growth model and a panel data set of 174 countries
    from 1960 to 2014, focusing on temperature and precipitation deviations from historical
    norms.
  2: Theoretical growth model links temperature and precipitation deviations to real
    output growth; empirical approach considers dynamics, feedback effects, and distinguishes
    between growth and level effects.
  3: "Uses empirical analysis and counterfactual exercises to estimate income effects\
    \ from temperature increases, comparing scenarios against historical trends from\
    \ 1960\u20132014."
  4: Panel ARDL model is used to analyze the relationship between changes in GDP per
    capita and deviations from historical temperature and precipitation norms. Historical
    norms are computed using moving averages with m = 20 and 40. The model accounts
    for asymmetrical effects of climate change on growth. The reasons for using ARDL
    growth regressions in deviations form are discussed in Appendix A.2.
  5: Panel ARDL regression with fixed effects (FE) and half-panel Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE)
    estimator. The analysis considers long-run estimates rather than specific dynamics
    and sets the lag order p=4. Climate norms are constructed as moving averages of
    the past 20, 30, and 40 years. Addresses bias from weakly exogenous regressors.
  6: Uses a panel data model with country fixed effects (FE) and a half-panel Jackknife
    FE (HPJ-FE) estimator to correct for bias, analyzing data from 1960-2014.  Historical
    norms are calculated as the average temperature/precipitation over the preceding
    *m* years, where *m* is 20, 30, or 40.
  7: Utilizes an ARDL specification and panel data models with interactive terms to
    analyze heterogeneous effects of temperature shocks across different countries
    based on income and climate.
  8: Uses an ARDL specification with country fixed effects (FE) and HPJ-FE (presumably
    a Hodrick-Prescott filter). Performs counterfactual analysis to estimate cumulative
    output per capita effects of temperature increases from 2015-2100.  Estimates
    consider countries with at least 30 years of GDP growth data (1960-2014).  Examines
    heterogeneous responses in cold, temperate, and hot climates, as well as poor
    and rich countries.
  9: "The analysis uses a half-panel Jackknife mean-group estimator to estimate the\
    \ impact of temperature changes on GDP growth from 1960-2014. Two specifications\
    \ are tested, one excluding and one including the lagged world GDP growth rate\
    \ (\U0001D6E5\u0304\U0001D466\U0001D464,\U0001D461\u22121). The analysis also\
    \ uses IPCC's projections under the RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios to project temperatures\
    \ out to 2099."
  10: The analysis uses a half-panel Jackknife fixed effects (HPJ-FE) procedure on
    data from 174 countries, examining the effect of deviations from historical temperature
    norms on GDP growth, considering counterfactual scenarios for RCP 2.6 and RCP
    8.5.
  11: "Panel data estimates with heterogeneous effects across climates and income\
    \ groups; Counterfactual exercises investigating output effects of annual increases\
    \ in temperatures under mitigated and unmitigated scenarios during 2015\u2013\
    2100."
  12: Analysis performed using climate scenarios (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) and calculates
    GDP per capita losses as PPP GDP weighted averages.
More Notes:
  3: The analysis finds no asymmetric growth impact from positive and negative temperature
    deviations and shows that both rich and poor countries are affected, with varying
    degrees.
  4: "The analysis uses an unbalanced panel dataset of 174 countries between 1960\
    \ and 2014. The paper checks the robustness of results by using moving averages\
    \ with m=20 and 40 to calculate historical norms. The long-run effects, \u03B8\
    , are calculated from the OLS estimates of the short-run coefficients in Eq. (1):\
    \ \U0001D73D  = \U0001D719\u22121 \u2211\U0001D45D\U0001D4C1=0  \U0001D737\U0001D4C1\
    , where  \U0001D719= 1\u2212  \u2211\U0001D45D\U0001D4C1=1 \U0001D711\U0001D4C1\
    ."
  6: The analysis considers both positive and negative deviations from historical
    temperature and precipitation norms, and also absolute values of these deviations.  It
    finds that adaptation efforts might be concentrated in certain countries and sectors,
    and may not be keeping pace with climate change.
  7: Statistical insignificance may be due to lack of power; hence, further exploration
    with HPJ-MG estimator is suggested to assess heterogeneity in effects.
  9: The analysis assumes temperature shocks are serially uncorrelated, Gaussian random
    variables. It also considers country-specific changes in trend temperature based
    on IPCC projections. The paper notes that the assumption of constant temperature
    volatility is conservative and may underestimate the adverse effects.
  11: The figures show the percent loss in GDP per capita by 2100 under RCP 8.5 and
    RCP 2.6 scenarios, respectively.
Quantitative material:
  1: "A persistent increase in average global temperature by 0.04\xB0C per year could\
    \ reduce world real GDP per capita by more than 7 percent by 2100, while abiding\
    \ by the Paris Agreement goals could reduce the loss to about 1 percent."
  3: "A 0.01 \xB0C annual temperature rise reduces income growth by 0.0543 percentage\
    \ points per year; a 0.04 \xB0C increase reduces global GDP per capita by 7.22%\
    \ by 2100 under RCP 8.5."
  4: "Projected GDP impact for some future year, typically 2100, showing potential\
    \ GDP per capita losses with varying temperature increases. Shaded area represents\
    \ the GDP per capita losses from counterfactual exercise in Section 3 with the\
    \ upper bound based on \U0001D45A = 20 and the lower bound based on \U0001D45A\
    \ = 40."
  5: "A 0.01 \u25E6C annual increase in temperature above its historical norm reduces\
    \ real GDP per capita growth by 0.0577 percentage points per year. A 0.01 \u25E6\
    C annual decrease in temperature below its historical norm reduces real GDP per\
    \ capita growth by 0.0505 percentage points per year."
  6: "Provides estimates of the long-run effects (\u0302\U0001D703) of temperature\
    \ and precipitation changes on per capita real GDP growth, e.g., -0.373*** for\
    \ the effect of positive temperature deviations with m=20 under Specification\
    \ 1 (FE)."
  7: Rolling estimates of long-run effects of temperature increases are depicted,
    with a line chart indicating a downward trend from approximately -0.80 to -1.20
    in the ARDL specification.
  8: "Table 3 presents coefficients (\U0001D703) that quantify the impact of temperature\
    \ deviations from historical norms on per capita real GDP growth. For example,\
    \ in Specification 3 (FE), a coefficient of -0.551** is reported, significant\
    \ at the 5% level, suggesting a negative impact of temperature deviations. The\
    \ counterfactual analysis projects output changes under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios\
    \ compared to a historical trend baseline."
  9: "The table presents estimates of \u0302\U0001D703\U0001D6E5|\u0303\U0001D447\U0001D456\
    \U0001D461(\U0001D45A)|, which represents the estimated impact of temperature\
    \ changes on per capita real GDP growth. These estimates are provided for different\
    \ groups of countries (all, cold, temperate/hot, poor, rich) and for different\
    \ historical norms (m)."
  10: Under RCP 8.5, real per capita output is projected to reduce by 0.80, 2.51,
    and 7.22 percent in 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. Under a high climate variability
    scenario, GDP losses could reach 13.11 percent by 2100 globally and 70 percent
    higher for the U.S. compared to a baseline.
  11: "0.01 \u25E6C annual deviation from historical norm lowers long-term income\
    \ growth by 0.0543 percentage points per year; RCP 8.5 scenario reduces world's\
    \ real GDP per capita by 7 percent by 2100; Country-specific climate variability\
    \ rising commensurate to temperature increases under RCP 8.5 would cause income\
    \ losses amounting to 13 percent by 2100; Abiding by the Paris Agreement objective\
    \ will reduce global income by 1 percent by 2100."

    2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios across the years 2030, 2050, and 2100.
