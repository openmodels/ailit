    hurricanes, bark beetle outbreaks); Slow onset events (desertification, loss of
    biodiversity, land and ecosystem degradation, ocean acidification, sea level rise).
  17: Uncertainty related to future emission scenarios, climate model projections,
    socio-economic scenarios, the physical impacts of climate change, and the potential

  125: Climate-related risks are impacting the agricultural sector, particularly reducing
    yields of staple foods.
  126: Heavy rains, heat waves, drought
  127: Imperfect forecasts of weather indices can lead to stable or decreasing numbers
    of insured farmers in Weather Index Insurance (WII) schemes.
  128: Future climate change impacts, such as increased droughts due to global warming
    and the expansion of subtropical dry zones, are highlighted as key drivers of
    risk affecting economic activities, especially agriculture.
  130: Climate change intensifying the hydrological cycle
  138: Weather- and climate-related extremes; market and technology shifts, loss of
    reputation and policy and legal challenges.
  141: Changes in climate (temperature, precipitation, atmospheric greenhouse gas
    concentrations), land management practices.
  144: Shocks such as flood, drought, yield shocks, price shocks, pandemic, and cyber-attacks;

  145: Climate change impacts on surface runoff (drought and flood risk) due to different
    greenhouse gas emission scenarios (SSP1-RCP4.5 and SSP5-RCP8.5). Autonomous adaptation
    in land manager choices driven by economic interests can negatively impact environmental
    externalities.
  149: Climate uncertainties impacting water resources necessitate adaptive decision-making.
  160: Climate change, specifically changes in precipitation and temperature, impacting
    water availability.
  163: Climate change; Land use changes; Climate uncertainty

  180: Techno-institutional lock-in in water resources management; Incremental change
    in public institutions; Limited technology-led transformational responses.
  183: Physical risks and transitional risks are drivers of risk. Climate-related
    policies and shifting demands from customers and investors are also drivers of
    risk.
  184: Systemic societal responses to climate change induced by governments (e.g.,
    increasing CO2 pricing and taxes) and novel demands from investors, customers,
    and the marketplace.
  185: "Policy changes driven by GHG emission reduction targets, including the EU's\
    \ goals to limit temperature increase to well below 2\xB0C and closer to 1.5\xB0\
    C; Demands for enhanced GHG emission reduction targets are considered as conditions\
    \ in COVID-19 recovery support to private companies."
  191: More common extreme weather events due to climate change making insurance unaffordable
    or unavailable.
  192: Climate-related hazards and the potential impact and interconnectivity of risks
    posed by climate change.
  193: Flood depth is a key driver of risk. The effectiveness of flood-resilience
    technologies (dry proofing) influences the extent of damage.
  194: Natural disasters leading to property damage and interruption of business activities;
    non-damage business interruption (NDBI) where businesses are affected even without

  233: Climate change drivers must be considered jointly with socio-economic ones.
  236: Climate change; Cross-sectoral climate impacts
  243: Storm surge floods
Highlights:
  7: The page highlights the existing gap between adaptation science and modeling
    and the usability of information by policymakers at various levels.
  17: Adaptation does not involve a single quantitative objective and cannot be assessed
    with a single common metric. Adaptation involves complex temporal dimensions and
    uncertainty.
  23: Adaptation is incorporated into IAMs in very different ways, ranging from implicit
    inclusion in damage functions to explicit cost-benefit analyses of specific adaptation
    measures. Some models also consider geoengineering as an extreme form of adaptation.
  25: IAMs may underestimate the benefits of adaptation and make rough, ad-hoc assumptions
    on adaptation costs and benefits, lacking technological details.
  27: Bottom-up approaches neglect potential remote impacts, whereas top-down approaches
    capture remote impacts through cross-sectoral and cross-regional interactions.
    The authors present main findings of their economic impact assessments of climate
    change and adaption modelling and discuss the challenges for incorporating adaptation
    measures and policies into macroeconomic models.
  28: GRACE is a flexible and consistent modelling framework that can depict cross-sectoral
    and cross-regional interactions to project economic development, and it can be
    used to assess the trade-offs between climate change mitigation and adaptation
    policies.
  29: Without mitigation policies, the impacts of climate change on economies can
    be large, implying high costs of adaptation; RCP4.5 may represent an optimal,
    global strategy as it leads to stabilization of climate change impacts in the
    long term; adaptation among economic agents can result in price effects with impacts
    on sector composites and trade
  31: Macroeconomic analysis may underestimate the vulnerability of people in the
    agricultural sector compared to micro-level studies.
  32: Heat stress leads to GDP decline, autonomous adaptation (mechanization) reduces
    the impact, GDP decline is greater under RCP8.5 than RCP2.6.
  33: Adaptation plays a key role in diminishing adverse impacts of climate change.
  34: Climate change can result in economic costs due to heat-induced reductions in
    worker productivity.
  46: Storylines enrich the understanding of potential causal chains leading to unexpected
    impacts, helping to manage uncertainty better.
  48: Traditional model validation relying solely on historical data comparison is
    insufficient. Global sensitivity analysis can improve model evaluation, transparency,
    and robustness, strengthening stakeholder confidence in adaptation strategies.
  51: Global climate change scenarios only matter for long-term planning while local
    factors such as near-shore coastal bathymetry reflected in the wave setup parameter
    dominated in the short and mid-term (~over the next 50 years).
  65: Managing uncertainty in agricultural projections to avoid maladaptation and
    improve applicability of scientific results
  68: The use of EOA value enables more informed decision-making by allowing for the
    selection of adaptation options with higher confidence, enhancing the effectiveness
    of adaptation strategies under varying conditions.
  69: Focus on local optimal combinations of wheat cultivars and management strategies
    to adapt to climate change with high confidence under moderate perturbations.
  73: Selection of best possible coastal management measures (considering costs, effectiveness,
    and acceptance) is mandatory in the future to reduce risks at coastal areas.
  76: Models can be used to simulate and evaluate the effectiveness of current and
    potential future DRR measures under storm conditions and climate change; DRR measures
    can be split into exposure-reducing and pathway-obstructing types, requiring different
    modelling approaches.
  77: The DRR assessment can be performed ex-ante, allowing for the development of
    the best possible DRR solutions before climate impacts manifest, improving preparedness
    and resource optimization.
  78: Indirect impacts of climate change (like disruptions to coastal economies) are
    often not accounted for and should be included in future impact assessments. Cost-benefit
    analyses of DRR measures are highly advised.
  81: Identified key challenges include ensuring the salience and credibility of impact
    modeling, co-exploration of current model capabilities, and co-identification
    of critical impact thresholds and uncertainties representation.
  86: Adaptation measures reduce the likelihood of crossing an impact threshold.
  88: The approach is currently being tested in five sectors at national scale in
    Finland.
  93: Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) can represent a sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective
    approach to reduce societal risk associated with climate change and enhanced precipitation.
  108: Observed increase in damage is due to societal change and economic development;
    effect on damage from climate change has hardly been observed until now; increase
    in flood hazard is counteracted by a decrease in vulnerability via effective flood
    risk management; vulnerability can be positively influenced by integrated flood
    risk management; recent modern buildings with good thermal insulation and innovative
    building materials tend to increase average building losses due to their high
    susceptibility to flooding.
  116: No relevant information
  121: Urban climate services can provide scientific support through maps, data and
    climate scenarios leading to potential improvement of the effectiveness into a
    range of public services and the development of evidence-based urban policies.
  125: Weather-Based Index Insurance (WII) is suggested as a cost-effective mechanism
    to mitigate agricultural risks and support sustainable development goals, particularly
    helping to address hunger, reduce inequalities, and promote climate action.
  126: WII could have a great impact on making access to insurances easier for farmers
    than it is today. The quality of the forecast would affect the optimal strategy
    to be selected by an insurance policy buyer under conditions of inevitable uncertainty.
  127: Imperfect weather forecasts can destabilize Weather Index Insurance (WII) participation.
  128: Future droughts will likely have increased negative impacts on agriculture
    as a sensitive sector, highlighting the importance of adaptation measures through
    improved forecasting and insurance models.
  130: Better modelling of flood hazard is needed as a prerequisite to understanding
    how flood risk might change in the future with climate.
  138: Contemporary climate risk models do not adequately take into account the sensitivities
    of cascading failure mechanisms across infrastructure networks; Socio-hydrological
    models help to overcome the gap of reciprocal feedbacks between human and water
    systems.
  141: The LandSyMM model can be used for climate adaptation assessment in the food
    system by simulating the impact of climate and land management on crop yields,
    food security, and trade.
  144: LandSyMM offers the opportunity to represent trade-offs, responses, and cross-scale
    and international interactions within a dynamic system. It can assess the impacts
    of mitigation policies on the land and food systems, including the removal of
    agricultural land and increases in prices for agricultural commodities.
  145: Land manager adaptation decisions driven by economic interests may negatively
    impact environmental externalities like greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater use,
    and biodiversity loss. LandSyMM can inform policymakers on the trade-offs between
    different policy options and impacts on the food system.
  148: Methods for risk analysis and decision analysis provide powerful tools for
    informing climate change adaptation in the water sector.
  149: Key decision-making principles include promoting flexibility and robustness,
    as well as exposing trade-offs using multi-objective optimization.
  155: The framework aims to support the selection of adaptation measures at the river
    basin level by integrating the goals of economic efficiency, social acceptability,
    environmental sustainability, and adaptation robustness, leading to robust, reliable
    and resilient water management portfolios.
  160: High uncertainty exists in future water availability. Spatial variability of
    climate change impacts exists in the basin, with temperature increase and precipitation
    decrease higher in the upper basin. Meteorological and hydrological droughts are
    expected to grow in intensity, magnitude, and duration.
  168: Investing in reducing the duration of disruption should be a priority of adaptation
    planners in Argentina.
  169: Network analyses are becoming more prevalent and achievable due to increased
    data availability and can help prioritize investments to build systemic resilience.
  173: "Standard decision-making based on a complete probabilistic description of\
    \ future conditions and optimization of expected performance is no longer appropriate;\
    \ priority should be given to robustness, through the identi\uFB01cation of policies\
    \ that are (i) insensitive to foreseeable changes in future conditions and (ii)\
    \ adaptive to unforeseen contingencies."
  180: Techno-institutional complexes create barriers to the diffusion of new, transformational
    policies in water resources management.
  183: The European Green Deal suggests the EU to reduce its emissions from 40 to
    55% by 2030, aiming to enable European countries to meet their Paris Agreement
    targets. Science-based targets need to be adopted to measure and manage emissions,
    specifically focusing on Scope 3 emissions embedded in the value chain in the
    private sector.
  184: Transitional risks are not only negative, but also represent opportunities
    for diligent and responsible companies through new market developments, improved
    reputation, and branding.
  185: Transition risks must be expected in the private sector due to policy changes
    and GHG emission reduction demands; GHG accounting and reporting are moving from
    an area of relatively lower importance to a higher degree of concern and risk
    for companies.
  191: Insurers can contribute to climate change adaptation by including risk reduction
    measures in insurance products, helping to reduce avoidable damages and build
    a more resilient society.
  192: Insurance can contribute to climate change adaptation by incentivizing risk
    reduction measures through premium discounts, and that this can be a financially
    beneficial decision for policyholders.
  193: Flood-resilience measures like elevating houses can lead to significant premium
    reductions (e.g., >80% in A zone, >60% in V zone), demonstrating the financial
    benefits of adaptation. Insurance can play a significant role in climate change
    adaptation by incentivizing risk reduction measures.
  194: There is a significant protection gap for BI risks, and risk transfer alone
    is not sufficient to ensure sustainable insurance coverage. BI risk assessment
    and modeling lag behind property damage assessment in catastrophe models.
  195: Adaptation measures in property and NDBI insurance can reduce climate change
    risk in mortgage and trade credit insurance; climate change related costs are
    a source of credit risk affecting household and firm creditworthiness.
  196: Natural catastrophes can significantly increase mortgage delinquency rates,
    even for properties not directly damaged. Adaptive measures in property and NDBI
    insurance, and improved business contingency planning, can reduce insured risk
    and vulnerability to payment defaults. Credit insurers can contribute to climate
    change adaptation by supporting insureds in buyer/sectoral risk assessment and
    improving country/region risk assessment.
  218: No relevant information
  220: The impact chain approach is perceived as (1) an appropriate means for risk
    analysis, (2) a useful tool for communication of complex cause-effect relationships
    in climate change impacts and risks, and (3) a great approach to identify entry
    points for adaptation measures.
  236: JPI Climate aims to assist practitioners to adequately transform society towards
    climate resilience and consequently providing integrated climate knowledge and
    decision support services for societal innovation; Key projects include ERA4CS
    and AXIS.
  243: The figure shows changes in average event mortality related to storm surge
    floods for different world regions between 1900 and 2013.
Methodology:
  7: The book presents an overview of the technical, financial, economic, and non-monetary
    models and tools for climate change adaptation assessments; however, no specific
    methodologies are detailed on this page.
  17: Adaptation modelling supports informed decision-making for implementation; Prioritization
    of adaptation options requires extended decision support methods which include
    consideration of risk and uncertainty.
  21: The paper reviews Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), distinguishing between
    cross-sectoral optimization models (POMs) and economic assessment of climate policies
    (PEMs). It identifies 'generations' of IAMs that have enhanced the scientific
    understanding of climate change and influenced economic recommendations for climate
    policy.
  23: The page describes how different IAMs (DICE, FUND, PAGE, ICAM, MERGE, IMAGE)
    incorporate adaptation. DICE implicitly includes adaptation in the damage function,
    while AD-DICE explicitly disaggregates damage into adaptation costs and residual
    damages. FUND includes a cost-benefit analysis of coastal protection and assumes
    autonomous adaptation in agriculture. PAGE introduces a tolerable temperature
    that increases with adaptation. ICAM, MERGE, and IMAGE consider geoengineering
    as a form of adaptation.
  25: Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are used to analyze adaptation, but they
    often blur the line between direct damages and adaptation costs.
  27: The authors use top-down approaches, such as multi-region, multi-sector computable
    general equilibrium (CGE) models, and a macroeconomic model GRACE to assess economic
    impacts of climate change and adaptation.
  28: GRACE is a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model calibrated using
    the GTAP database to simulate supply and demand functions and find equilibrium
    prices and quantities.
  29: The GRACE model is used to assess the global consequences of climate change
    on standardized, economic indicators for evaluation of economic development.
  31: GRACE model is used to assess the macroeconomic impact. Household surveys in
    Bamrang Khola village are used to assess impacts on smallholders. The macroeconomic
    analysis is projected up to 2050 under a high emission pathway (RCP8.5).
  32: Economic impact assessment using the GRACE model, implementing autonomous adaptation
    (air conditioners, mechanization), projections of mechanization based on regression
    analysis (tractors per hectare as proxy, GDP per capita as explanatory variable),
    comparison of RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, comparison of mechanization vs. no
    mechanization.
  33: Notes that CGE models often use static or recursive-dynamic approaches, limiting
    the representation of anticipatory adaptation.
  34: Uses the GRACE model.
  44: "The Dutch climate change scenarios (KNMI\u201914) aggregated ~250 global and\
    \ regional climate change projections into four discrete narratives based on global\
    \ warming level and regional atmospheric circulation response."
  46: Climate risk storylines are developed to map potential socio-economic consequences
    of extreme climate events outside Europe, utilizing experience from practitioners
    and new simulation and analysis techniques.
  48: Impact models are used to translate climate conditions into variables of interest
    (like drought or flood risk). The paper suggests using global sensitivity analysis
    in addition to historical data comparison to evaluate these models and ensure
    robustness. Sensitivity analysis can assess the impact of intervention options
    (e.g., land use choices) on model outputs and understand the robustness of outputs
    to input uncertainties.
  51: Time-varying global sensitivity analysis is used to determine the factors that
    most strongly control the vulnerability of coastal flood defences over time.
  54: Global sensitivity analysis can strengthen confidence in climate change impact
    models, even for complex or global domain models.
  61: Systems modelling offers a means of evaluating adaptation options through simulations
    with and without adaptations, using varied inputs representing expected boundary
    conditions.
  63: Field experimentation is informative when adaptation outcomes are observable
    under extreme weather or controlled laboratory conditions; Systems modelling credibility
    depends on plausible narratives of change to bound simulation inputs and model
    parameters; Strong counterfactuals are needed to assess outcomes.
  65: Combination of techniques to identify uncertainties, exclude unviable outcomes,
    consider possible futures probabilistically, and select the most robust projections
    for adaptation
  68: An Impact Response Surface (IRS) and Adaptation Response Surface (ARS) are used
    to assess impacts and adaptations qualitatively, and an Ensemble Outcome Agreement
    (EOA) index is developed to assess the confidence in adaptation option outcomes.
  69: Use of EOA (ensemble of opportunities analysis) for evaluating adaptation options
    and managing uncertainty in agricultural projections.
  73: Presents a generic approach to model disaster risk reduction measures at coastal
    areas, including climate change effects; adaptable to any coastal region; can
    be used to test and improve management options; can be used to define a timeframe
    for implementation of defined measures.
  76: Simulating historical and climate change-related storm scenarios with and without
    DRR measures to predict local flooding and erosion, which are then combined with
    characteristics of the local population, built environment, and infrastructure
    to compute storm impact and the effectiveness of the measures.
  77: The analysis involves using models that incorporate future climate scenarios
    and DRR measures to assess their effectiveness, requiring input variables like
    wave height and total sea-level, and may include rerunning the models for different
    scenarios and years.
  78: "Process-based models for DRR measures, historical analysis of damage from past\
    \ events, cost\u2013benefit analysis including ecosystem services."
  81: Model-based response surface approach using impact response surfaces (IRSs)
    from simulations with sectoral impact models across climate-sensitive sectors
    to assess sensitivity, urgency, and response.
  86: Combining the IRS method with probabilistic projections of driving variables
    to estimate future climate-related risks; site-based modelling study
  88: The approach to risk assessment can be updated as new scenarios appear without
    needing to re-run the underlying impact models.
  108: Temporal trend analyses on flood damage data; paired event case studies; modeling
    approaches considering drivers of risk along with their interactions and feedbacks.
  111: 'The Regional Flood Model (RFM) uses a multi-step approach: (1) Weather Generator
    to create 10000 years of spatially consistent meteorological series, (2) Rainfall-Runoff
    SWIM model to generate river discharge series, (3) a 1D hydrodynamic model for
    river network routing and dike overtopping discharge, (4) a 2D raster-based hydrodynamic
    model for hinterland inundation, and (5) FLEMOps+r to calculate direct damage
    to residential buildings.'

    local scale of the city, perturbing local time series of measured precipitation
    intensity according to climate change signals.
  121: Data gathering and analytical methods employed according to the specificities
    of each demonstration case, the goal of the climate service, and the kind of available
    data and stakeholders
  126: Theoretical modelling of dynamical features of Weather Index Insurance (WII)
    project implementation, simulating strategies of producers in drought-prone regions
    regarding WII policy purchase, and the dynamics of aggregate demand for this kind
    of insurance.
  127: A simple conceptual model for WII using a simple power law to parameterize
    the dependence of crop yield on the weather index, and a simple random process
    to represent the dynamics of both actual and forecasted weather index.
  128: The paper uses a weather index insurance (WII) model with hypothetical perfect
    and imperfect forecasts and a stationary random process to simulate stochastic
    dynamics, proposing potential adaptation through climate services.
  130: Numerical modelling of flood hazards; Global flood models
  138: Bottom-up (BU) approach through participative methods combined with a systematic
    approach; modelling vulnerability of large-scale infrastructure networks; interdisciplinary
    framework combines socio-hydrology and economics; Environmentally Extended Input
    Output models, Life Cycle Assessments or a combination of both (hybrid models).
  141: Simulation using the Land System Modular Model (LandSyMM), which integrates
    climate impacts, land management, commodity consumption, land use, vegetation,
    and climate into a worldwide dynamic economic system. It considers fine spatial
    scales and can simulate over long-term predictions.
  144: "The LandSyMM model captures dietary requirements and preferences at the country\
    \ level and how consumption changes in response to income levels as well as endogenous\
    \ country level food commodity prices. It also models land management practices,\
    \ the effects of autonomous decisions from the food system\u2019s actors, and\
    \ their interactions with mitigation policies. It can simulate the changing risk\
    \ of shocks. Policy levers like international trade tariff barriers and agricultural\
    \ subsidies can be implemented."
  145: The LandSyMM model is used to predict surface runoff changes between 1971-2000
    and 2071-2100 under different SSP and RCP scenarios.
  148: Water resource system simulation is used to predict the hydrologic, socioeconomic,
    and environmental consequences of water management, especially in the face of
    climate change. This includes modelling the connected hydrologic, infrastructure,
    ecologic, and human processes that involve water.
  149: Decision-making methods under uncertainty leverage hydrological simulation
    models to manage water resources with an emphasis on flexibility, robustness,
    and trade-off analysis; results are applicable when dealing with long-term climate
    uncertainties.
  155: A 'top-down meets bottom-up' approach is used for climate change adaptation
    in water resource systems. The top-down approach uses a chain of models to assess
    the impact of global change on water resources, while the bottom-up approach identifies
    future demand scenarios and locally prioritized adaptation measures through a
    participatory process. Cost-effective combinations of adaptation measures are
    selected using a hydro-economic model at basin scale, and then climate checked.
  160: Local climate change projections are used as input to hydrological models to
    simulate impacts on available resources, and agro-climatic models. For the Orb
    case, climate scenarios downscaled from nine GCMs were used. A monthly lumped
    two-parameter rainfall-runoff model was calibrated and validated on 11 sub-basins
    using observed monthly discharge. For the Jucar case, combinations of GCMs-RCMs
    were selected by comparing observed versus simulated time series of mean annual
    precipitation and temperature. Hydrological changes were obtained from a Temez
    rainfall-runoff model. A hydroeconomic model of the basin selects the most cost-efficient
    combination of adaption measures for future scenarios.

  166: A hybrid top-down and bottom-up climate vulnerability, risk, and adaptation
    assessment of infrastructure networks is proposed, combining climate hazard information,
    spatial representations of network assets, vulnerability measures, network connectivity
    effects, and indirect socio-economic impacts.
  168: Incorporating the sensitivities of climate models and scenarios with transport
    and economic growth forecasts. BCRs of upgrading roads and bridges to higher climate
    resilience designs are assessed.

More Notes:
  7: The page discusses the integration of expert opinions and case studies to propose
    practical guidelines for decision-makers without specific details on macroeconomic
    or fiscal implications.
  23: The page notes that literature on adaptation costs is scarce and that local
    damages are uncertain.
  25: Adaptive capacity, as defined by Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), is not
    yet harmonized into damage functions in IAMs.
  28: The regional and sectoral aggregation is flexible depending on the scope and
    focus of a study.
  31: "The study highlights the importance of considering constraints related to farm\
    \ size and the division between food products sold in markets and food for farmers\u2019\
    \ own consumption."
  32: Autonomous mechanization is linked to SSPs.
  33: There is a need for a better integration of proactive adaptation under uncertainties
    into macroeconomic models.

  44: Additional tailoring and user guidance are indispensable for efficient societal
    uptake of climate information (Berkhout et al. 2014).
  48: The paper focuses on the evaluation of climate change impact models, rather
    than providing direct quantitative results on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
    It advocates for better model validation to improve the reliability of downstream
    analyses that would inform adaptation decisions.
  51: Wave setup uncertainty is often neglected in coastal hazard assessments studies,
    potentially invalidating conclusions and overestimating the effects of other drivers
    for short and mid-term planning periods.
  54: The research was supported by the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC),
    a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award, and an Alexander von Humboldt Professorship.
  63: Stress-testing requires long-term monitoring, evaluation, and learning to benchmark
    performance metrics and to confirm that expected project outcomes are achieved.
  65: The study focuses on agricultural adaptation (winter wheat in Spain) as a case
    study and may not directly translate to nation-wide macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes.
  68: The focus is on adaptation strategies for wheat in Spain, particularly emphasizing
    the need for confidence in adaptation proposals using the EOA index.
  69: Maladaptation could result from not considering the full analysis; focus on
    switching to spring cultivars with certain sowing dates in Spain for better adaptation.
  76: The described flowchart shows a process from validation and calibration to decision-making
    based on risk assessment, DRR assessment, and effectiveness in relation to current
    conditions and climate change.
  77: The page discusses vulnerability-reducing measures and the importance of using
    expert judgment in selecting DRR measures and involving stakeholders in the process
    to ensure sustainability and acceptance.
  78: The paper emphasizes limitations of current models due to data limitations and
    difficulty in direct use by end-users. It recommends better determination of vulnerability
    relationships between indicators of damage and exposed elements and improved knowledge
    transfer from scientists to end-users. DRR measures are beach nourishment, dune
    recovery, and rising buildings.
  81: The approach is being tested for different sectors in Finland, focusing on risks
    in areas like agriculture and water management.
  86: The paper mentions the method has 'limited uptake' and is 'subject of ongoing
    research' beyond water resource management and agriculture.
  108: Knowledge about changes in vulnerability and risk is scarce so that more monitoring
    and empirical data analyses are necessary; modelling approaches are necessary
    for projecting future trends or developing future scenarios for flood risk.
  111: The model aims to simulate flood events and assess the direct damage to residential
    buildings based on water depth, return period, building type, and quality.
  116: This page focuses on urban climate change impacts and the Climate-fit.City
    project. While it mentions economic impacts related to disrupted transportation
    networks due to flooding, it doesn't provide specific macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    details at a national level or discuss the costs and benefits of adaptation in
    a quantifiable way.
  117: Focus is on urban adaptation, which is relevant as a subnational component
    of national-level adaptation, though the paper does not aggregate to the national
    level. The Climate-fit.City project provides customized information and services
    to urban administrations/institutions and territorial entities as well as private
    companies.
  121: The Climate-fit.City service uses the same urban climate data across all components,
    streamlining the application of multiple services.
  125: Crop insurance, especially index-based schemes, redistributes risk and enhances
    resilience against climate-related agricultural risks.
  127: The model's current form is generic and requires crop- and region-specific
    adaptations for successful real-world WII implementation.
  130: The paper discusses recent progress in the development of global flood models
    (GFMs) and potential areas for model improvement, focusing on topography, extreme
    flow estimation, river network parameterisation and numerical modelling of inundation.
  141: The model considers both direct and indirect adaptation mechanisms. Indirect
    mechanisms include responses to market movements or policy decisions created by
    environmental changes.

    codebases for Vietnam and Argentina transport risk and adaptation analysis. Data
    collection is highlighted as key to reduce uncertainties in model estimates.
  170: The paper acknowledges limitations in current climate hazard models and emphasizes
    the need for improved data collection on impact assessment elements.
  173: Integration among disciplines (socio-hydrology and institutional economics)
    remains weak and allows only for a fractioned understanding and partial representation
    of uncertainty.
  179: This paper focuses on the adaptively efficient institutions in water resource
    management, but it does not explicitly provide information on national-level macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal outcomes related to climate change adaptation. It primarily discusses
    the challenges of measuring and analyzing the performance of institutions involved
    in water management and the issue of institutional lock-in.
  180: The page recommends developing a flexible, interdisciplinary modular hierarchy
    for multi-system ensembles to understand the adaptive behavior of human-water
    systems. It also calls for gathering longitudinal transaction cost data to analyze
    institutional performance and drivers of adaptive robustness. Stakeholder integration
    in the generation of methods and results is emphasized to strengthen science-policy
    synergies.
  183: "The ultimate goal is a harmonized methodology to create a detailed emissions\
    \ inventory and risk disclosure of a company\u2019s operations."
  184: The paper focuses on transitional risks and how they affect the private sector,
    aiming to point out the challenges facing the private sector in adapting decision-making
    and business models to transitional climate risk.
  191: The paper distinguishes between climate change mitigation (avoiding catastrophic
    events) and adaptation (limiting the impact of events).
  193: The paper suggests insurance can incentivize pro-active management of business
    interruption risks related to climate change.
  194: Standard BI insurance is often considered an 'annexe' to property insurance,
    with no individual assessment of BI risk, which may be insufficient in the event
    of a widespread natural catastrophe. BI value represents only a small percentage
    of the total sum insured for the commercial sector compared to Buildings and Contents
    value.
  196: The study uses Corelogic 2018 data and focuses on the 90+ day delinquency rate
    in Texas. FEMA designation of affected counties is used to partition the data.

  220: The framework has been applied in almost twenty national climate risk assessments
    worldwide (e.g., Burundi, Bangladesh, Thailand, Vietnam, Madagascar).
  233: The paper emphasizes that decision-making for climate change adaptation is
    affected by deep uncertainty and that model outputs need to be integrated with
    other sources of knowledge for decision support.
