  11: comprehensive review providing an up-to-date and forward-looking overview of
    models and tools, highlighting main research and policy gaps, proposal of recommended
    approaches for modelling climate-related risks and impacts
  17: Adaptation does not have a single quantitative objective, making it different
    from mitigation. Adaptation involves complex temporal dimensions and high uncertainty,
    complicating modeling. The benefits of adaptation are difficult to model quantitatively
    due to sector-, location-, and context-specificity, along with the involvement
    of non-technical options.
  18: Adaptation modelling is evolving, addressing previous challenges, and focusing
    on interdisciplinary and decision-maker-informed approaches.
  19: Highlights the need for climate change impact models to improve analysis of
    local/regional implications for adaptation strategies. Emphasizes the importance
    of managing uncertainty in agricultural projections to increase adaptation effectiveness
    and avoid maladaptation.
  21: "An evolutionary \u201Cfamily research\u201D of IAMs helps to identify \u201C\
    generations\u201D of models, where each generation enhanced the scientific understanding\
    \ of climate change and influenced the economic recommendations for climate policy\
    \ based on these models."
  24: Adaptation measures are categorized as quick-acting or precautionary with long
    life spans, addressing average climate change or extreme events.
  27: Bottom-up approaches to adaptation often neglect potential remote impacts, whereas
    top-down approaches can capture cross-sectoral and cross-regional interactions.
  28: GRACE can depict cross-sectoral and cross-regional interactions and integrate
    lessons from adaptation research to project economic development. It can also
    be used to assess the trade-offs between climate change mitigation and adaptation
    policies.
  30: Without adaptation, climate change leads to a reduction in the value added from
    forests world-wide; adaptation related to management turns the impacts on the
    value of forests positive; adaptation related to harvesting further increases
    the positive economic impacts.
  31: Macro-level constraints like farm size limit adaptation efforts, highlighting
    a disconnect between macroeconomic assessments and individual household impacts,
    with household-level impacts being more significant.
  32: Mechanization reduces the decline in GDP by approximately 0.4 percentage points
    under RCP8.5 by 2100 compared to no mechanization.
  33: Adaptation plays a key role in diminishing adverse impacts of climate change.
    Top-down economic models capture cross-sectoral and cross-regional interactions
    but are highly aggregated. Bottom-up models neglect potential remote impacts.
    There's a potential in the complementarity of top-down and bottom-up approaches.
    Proactive adaptation under uncertainties needs better integration into macroeconomic
    models.
  35: Remaining and emerging gaps in climate services are identified, including those
    related to breadth, quality, relevance, infrastructure, and factors enabling market
    growth.
  36: Climate services include data and information supporting adaptation, mitigation,
    and disaster risk management, consisting of guidance for adaptation/resilience,
    supporting data/information, tools/resources, and enablers like knowledge brokering
    and training. Climate services aim to inform decision-making across public, community,
    civil society, business, and individual levels.
  37: "Identified gaps suggest a need to continue efforts focusing on building the\
    \ market framework and also recognised the need to retain an appropriate balance\
    \ in investments that continued supporting the underpinning research and associated\
    \ infrastructure, in addition to supporting innovations, Climateurope recommendations\
    \ directly related to climate services: Supporting the formulation of adaptation\
    \ strategies\u2014systematic availability of impact-oriented projections and up-to-date\
    \ near-term predictions downscaled to local scale"
  38: "Research projects often stop before becoming operational climate services.\
    \ Many potential users are not convinced of the value of climate services. Users\
    \ prefer an integrated approach to risks, not just climate change. The development\
    \ of climate services is hampered by scientific and communication difficulties.\
    \ Recommendations are consistent with and build on the challenges and activities\
    \ comprising the Roadmap. Breadth re\uFB02ects the interests and perspectives\
    \ of the community engaged in developing and articulating this set of recommendations."
  40: The demand-side of the climate service market has broadened and deepened. There
    is an increased focus on services supporting solutions and actions, particularly
    within the European Green Deal and EU Horizon Europe missions. A systematic assessment
    of remaining and emerging challenges in the climate service market is needed.
  42: To support climate adaptation decision-making, a picture of current and upcoming
    climate and socio-economic conditions is required, including an overview of intervention
    scenarios and their impact. This picture needs to rely on credible, relevant,
    and legitimate information, which implies the use of tested models and concepts,
    tailored to the decision context, and with transparent and understandable assumptions
    on boundary conditions and process representation.
  43: Climate scenario storylines are used to aggregate global climate change projections
    into stakeholder-oriented national scenarios; Climate risk storylines map climate-related
    shocks in globalized systems (trade, food security, finance).

    \ climate change projections into four discrete narratives, mutually discerned\
    \ by choosing two elementary drivers of national climate."
  45: "Temperature rises will continue, mild winters and hot summers will become more\
    \ frequent, an increase in precipitation is expected during winter, intensity\
    \ of extreme precipitation will rise, drier conditions will be more common in\
    \ summer, sea levels will continue to rise, rising sea levels lead to increased\
    \ flood risks, number of days with low visibility will rise, solar radiation will\
    \ increase at the earth\u2019s surface."
  48: Global sensitivity analysis can be used to demonstrate that the parameters defining
    intervention options (such as land use choices) adequately control the model output
    (even under potential future conditions); it can be used to understand the robustness
    of model outputs to input uncertainties over different projection horizons, the
    relevance of model assumptions, and how modelled environmental processes change
    with climatic boundary conditions.
  50: Identifies dominant processes by quantifying sensitivities in model parameters;
    intervention levers (land use, human activities) should adequately control model
    output; relevant sensitivities to other parameters may not be found, which may
    suggest that certain intervention strategies cannot be assessed using the model.
  51: Global climate change scenarios are crucial for long-term planning, while local
    factors like wave setup are more significant in short to mid-term planning.
  52: Dominant drivers of coastal defense vulnerability change significantly over
    time, and the most influential factors vary depending on temporal and climatic
    conditions.
  53: Sensitivity of a rainfall-runoff model (SAC-SMA) to its parameters changes strongly
    along a climatic gradient (aridity index). Dominant modeled processes change along
    a climatic gradient, which can be understood via sensitivity analysis.
  60: Riparian tree cover can significantly lower daily maximum water temperatures
    in summer, particularly under hotter conditions; Cool refugia created by spring
    flows should be protected.
  61: Systems modeling allows comprehensive integrated assessment of risks. Modest
    adaptation benefits can be achieved. Exhaustive stress-testing exposes system
    vulnerabilities.
  62: Deep uncertainty about the future climate and other major drivers of global
    change are not impediments to adaptation planning and options appraisal provided
    that decision-led frameworks are implemented.
  65: Approach is effective in increasing the probability of avoiding maladaptation
    and improving the applicability and assimilation of scientific results by users.
  68: An EOA value is assigned to adaptation options, allowing for the discarding
    of promising options with low confidence in favor of those with more confidence.
    Revisiting previous recommendations with the EOA index narrowed the range for
    which adaptation options were effective. Adaptation is possible under a wide range
    of future conditions, with at least one adaptation option (mainly based on spring
    wheat) found with a high EOA value for every perturbation combination of P and
    T.
  71: Components such as natural variability, anthropogenic climate change, emissions,
    land-use change, and socioeconomic processes interact to create climate risk.
  72: The need for better quantification of hazard-reducing effects of nature-based
    solutions, and the importance of high-resolution data in climate and weather services.
  73: The methodology can define a timeframe for implementing risk reduction measures,
    optimizing costs and reducing risks associated with occupation and people.
  74: The need for testing and validating DRR and adaptive measures to minimize the
    impacts of coastal storms is emphasized.
  75: Process-based models, requiring high computational complexity and data availability
    for calibration, provide confidence in application due to their extensive validation.
  77: Continuity of the use of models for the evaluation of DRR effectiveness would
    allow the definition of local timeframes for coastal management, defining the
    optimal management approach at each moment within the next decades. The final
    decision on DRR measures should consider the measured effectiveness, the social-cultural
    and the ecological acceptance to ensure their sustainability and approval.
  78: The page highlights the limitations of current models, including a lack of high-quality
    quantitative validation data and the difficulty of direct use by end-users. It
    emphasizes the need for better determination of vulnerability relationships between
    indicators (e.g., water discharge, shoreline retreat) and exposed elements (e.g.,
    type of building). The importance of including indirect impacts and cascade effects
    in impact assessments is also emphasized.
  79: The proposal aims to contribute to the extended use of validated coastal models
    to enhance disaster preparedness and risk reduction at coastal areas.
  81: The approach aims to examine sensitivity of sectors to climate change, estimate
    risks of exceeding critical thresholds to determine response urgency, and determine
    the effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation responses. Ensuring salience and
    credibility of modelling through stakeholder engagement, co-exploration of model
    capabilities for adaptation representation, and co-identification of critical
    thresholds are key challenges.
  82: Proposes a systematic method of climate change impact and adaptation assessment
    at national or sub-national scale within a risk framework.
  86: IRS analysis can be used to estimate regional risk. Adaptation measures can
    shift the risk curve, changing the impact of temperature change. The likelihood
    of a threshold in 2060 can be quantified both without and with adaptation.
  87: The study highlights the increasing risk of water scarcity in the Vale do Gaio
    reservoir and demonstrates the potential of adaptation measures, such as switching
    to crops with lower water demand, to mitigate these risks.
  91: "Thresholds for landslide triggering are affected by long-term precipitations\
    \ in areas that are covered by deep deposits of \uFB01ne-grained soils, while\
    \ they are controlled by short-term precipitations in areas with shallower deposits\
    \ with coarse-grained soils."
  92: The use of vegetation for landslide risk mitigation is not yet sufficiently
    addressed in the modeling methods discussed.
  94: 'The use of vegetation for landslide protection has two positive effects: (i)
    increased soil strength due to roots, (ii) reduced pore water pressure due to
    plant uptake and canopy cover.  However, vegetation may destabilize slopes in
    connection with strong winds (trees).'
  95: Vegetation, through its roots and canopy, significantly influences soil parameters
    and hydrological processes, impacting slope stability.
  96: The effect of vegetation is complex and varies with time, type of soil, and
    atmospheric conditions.
  97: Need for combined efforts in local instrumentation and modelling development
    is pronounced; possible extreme events related to vegetation need to be studied
    with regard to initiation of extreme surface runoff and flash floods due to heavy
    rainfall.
  99: Diversification of crop rotations can increase resilience; integrated assessment
    requires long-term crop sequence analysis; crop models need more experimental
    data for parametrization of additional crops.
  100: Warming has prolonged the thermal growing season and frost-free period for
    crops across all of Europe since the 1980s; Crop diversification is considered
    an option to increase the resilience of European crop production under climate
    change.
  101: No single model performed best across all conditions; model ensembles provide
    better estimates. The interaction between heat and drought stress is genotype
    dependent and not sufficiently understood.
  105: No relevant information
  107: Focus on system-wide adaptation measures to reduce risk, but highlights the
    challenge of unexpected behavior such as the levee effect.
  110: SYMs allow for quantitative estimation of flood risk based on general system
    characteristics. SSMs can produce risk scenarios relevant to regional/local scales.
    ABMs capture characteristics of individual components and their interactions.
  113: Highlights the importance of adaptation to flood risk and the need for improved
    attribution of changes in drought and flood impacts.
  115: The Climate-fit.City service (https://www.climate-fit.city) provides scientific
    urban climate data for public and private end users.
  116: "Climate-\uFB01t.City translates the best available scienti\uFB01c urban climate\
    \ data into relevant information for public and private end users operating in\
    \ cities. Climate services raise awareness by end users, policymakers and the\
    \ general public about climate change."
  117: Increases visibility, awareness, and ownership of the adaptation challenge
    at both the policy and citizen levels; supports the development and adoption of
    adaptation strategies and action plans.
  119: "Climate-Fit.City demonstrated the use of urban pluvial \uFB02ooding risk maps\
    \ for climate change resilient emergency management."
  120: The most important outcomes are climate-inclusive bicycle traffic planning,
    building designs better adapted to urban climates, climate change management in
    zoos, and urban planning that mitigates heat stress.
  121: Urban climate services represent a relevant tool that can provide scientific
    support and lead to potential improvement of the effectiveness into a range of
    public services; potential support for the development of evidence-based urban
    policies.
  126: WII schemes can make insurance more accessible to farmers compared to traditional
    agricultural insurances, potentially enhancing resilience in farming systems.
  127: Perfect weather index forecasts lead to steady growth in WII demand, while
    imperfect forecasts can lead to stable or decreasing demand.
  130: Advances in flood inundation modeling in data-scarce areas and the emergence
    of GFMs that could form the foundation of global impact assessments.
  132: Airborne LiDAR data offer the most accurate terrain data for flood mapping;
    SRTM data has been the preeminent terrain data source for flood inundation mapping
    in data sparse regions; TanDEM-X DEM at 90 m can in theory support more accurate
    flood simulation than SRTM-based DEMs.
  134: Recent development of comprehensive data sets on river width and location,
    and the emergence of improved GFM hydrography are expected to advance flood modelling
    accuracy.
  135: Higher resolution and improved process representation in flood models have
    substantial impacts on flood exposure estimation over large scales; resolution
    and process inaccuracy tend to bias simulations towards greater exposure estimates;
    global flood models have different mixes of component parts, making uncertainty
    assessment and benchmarking difficult; a sophisticated GFM can be undermined by
    limitations in its components; validation studies may not be comprehensive and
    GFM accuracy is highly variable.
  137: The socio-economic model is also able to capture the relationship between food
    demand, income levels and food prices.
  138: Contemporary climate risk models inadequately capture cascading failure mechanisms
    in infrastructure networks; Socio-hydrological models can help capture reciprocal
    feedbacks between human and water systems; Only entire value chain emission analysis
    methods foster needed transparency of emissions accounting; Insurance and risk
    transfer can reward risk reduction and adaptation
  140: Land-based actions are seen as essential in the effort to mitigate climate
    change, but these tend to reduce areas available for food production.
  142: LandSyMM aims to support future climate research by assessing the interplay
    between natural system dynamics and socio-economic processes related to supply
    and demand. LandSyMM enables exploration of adaptation measures related to crop
    productivity variations from changes in management practices (e.g. fertilizer
    and irrigation rates), or management in forests.
  143: LandSyMM allows for flexible adjustments of irrigation and fertilizer as part
    of mitigation strategies and captures the relationship between changes in water
    resources and plant requirements under future climates, driving adaptation responses
    in land management.
  145: The analysis highlights the trade-offs and potential negative environmental
    impacts of autonomous agricultural adaptation to climate change.
  146: The current implementation of LandSyMM provides a platform to better understand
    the interactions between land-based climate adaptation and mitigation and to identify
    suitable policies and actions.
  148: Simulation models and decision analysis methods are considered mature and are
    increasingly applied by practitioners for climate adaptation in the water sector.
  149: The discussed decision analysis methods promote flexibility (ability to switch
    decisions depending on outcomes), robustness (decisions performing acceptably
    well under a wide range of plausible future conditions), and exposing trade-offs
    to mitigate undesirable impacts.
  150: System stress testing through computer simulation is an important tool for
    water resources planning in the face of climate change.
  151: "Recent advances in smart metering technology provide a promising avenue to\
    \ advance residential water demand modelling; Advances in economic analysis allow\
    \ for improved understanding and modelling of the impact of water use restrictions\
    \ on multiple users, feeding into cost\u2013benefit assessment of policy options\
    \ needed to reduce the risk of water shortages."
  153: "Intensifying calls for \u2018outcomes-based\u2019 management of water resources\
    \ and for reporting of climate-related risks are now providing a powerful motivator\
    \ for the wider adoption of water resource system models."
  155: The approach provides a systematic method for supporting the selection of adaptation
    measures by integrating economic efficiency, social acceptability, environmental
    sustainability, and adaptation robustness. The approach aims to define a robust
    program of measures based on trade-offs between adaptation costs and reliability,
    and to select robust, reliable, and resilient water management portfolios.
  156: Effective adaptation should combine both structural and non-structural measures,
    including regulatory and economic instruments; Selected adaptation is expected
    to be economically efficient, environmentally sustainable, socially acceptable,
    and robust
  158: Characterization of future scenarios of the agriculture sector is crucial for
    water management.
  164: The paper identifies existing gaps and future opportunities in bottom-up infrastructure
    network vulnerability, risk, and adaptation assessments.
  165: The paper addresses key questions related to climate adaptation of infrastructures
    such as identifying network vulnerabilities, cascade risks, socioeconomic impacts
    of failures, and adaptation investments and strategies.
  167: The purpose of the methodology outlined is to create an effective high-level
    screening whereby the efficacy of different types of adaptation options can be
    compared and locations and assets with high (or low) adaptation benefits can be
    narrowed down for further investigation.
  168: Transport networks in Vietnam and Argentina are increasingly exposed to more
    severe and frequent extreme hazards, requiring significant investments to upgrade
    to higher climate-resilient design standards; investing in reducing the duration
    of disruption should be a priority of adaptation planners in Argentina; Studies
    provide scientific evidence to transport ministries to develop a national strategy
    for climate-resilient transport and plans.
  170: Risk visualization tool outputs show the benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) of investing
    in climate adaptation.
  171: Need for multi-sectoral and multi-organizational commitment to address infrastructure
    resilience as a system-of-system problem; global call for integrating adaptation
    needs in infrastructure decision-making.
  172: The research explores disruptions across interdependent national infrastructure
    networks.
  174: Advocates for robustness in decision-making under deep uncertainty and addresses
    integration among disciplines to improve policy design.
  177: Identify futures where proposed policies meet or miss their objectives, explore
    potential tipping points, and inform the development of robust policies that show
    a satisfactory performance under most conceivable futures.
  180: Emphasizes creating valuable science-policy synergies to strengthen research
    and identify robust policies.
  181: Understanding the implications of adaptation in terms of water reallocation
    and rationing and related uncertainties is relevant for policymakers.
  183: Adaptation to climate change poses physical and transitional risks to the private
    sector. The European Green Deal presents both challenges and opportunities for
    innovation and development in the private sector.
  184: Transitional risks are systemic societal responses to climate change and can
    represent opportunities for companies via new market developments, improved reputation,
    and branding.
  185: Emphasis on the need for companies to assess, disclose, and explain their GHG
    emissions.
  186: Scope 1 includes direct emissions, Scope 2 includes indirect emissions associated
    with purchase of electricity, heat, steam or cooling, and Scope 3 encompasses
    upstream and downstream emissions, embedded in the value chain.
  187: Collaboration across the value chain is essential for companies aiming for
    GHG reduction targets aligned with the Paris Agreement; ISO standards may require
    significant upgrades in inventorying efforts if made mandatory.
  189: Emphasis on the pivotal period for companies to acknowledge and reduce emissions
    in line with EU Green Deal targets.
  191: Including risk reduction measures in an insurance product helps to better adapt
    to climate change by not only transferring the risk but by directly reducing avoidable
    damages when an event strikes.
  192: Insurers can contribute to climate change adaptation by incentivizing risk
    reduction through premium discounts, particularly for flood prevention measures.
    This can make risk reduction measures more likely to be adopted by policyholders.
  193: Flood-resilience technologies, such as elevation above Base Flood Elevation,
    can significantly reduce flood damage and insurance premiums.
  196: Mortgage delinquency rates increase significantly after natural disasters,
    even for properties with no damage, suggesting indirect climate impacts. Adaptive
    measures in property insurance and NDBI insurance can reduce insured risk.
  197: Prevention measures aimed to reduce the insured risk can only be properly quantified
    and thus reflected in the premium if adequate models are available.
  200: The page highlights the need for societal transformation to address climate
    change and the importance of engaging all members of society using health behavioral
    change models.
  205: The concept of 'Planetary Health' emphasizes the intersection between environmental
    sustainability and human health.
  209: Major gaps remain in adaptation modeling, including coarse spatial-temporal
    resolution, and limitations in funding/technical capacity for smaller administrations.
    The analysis release time often exceeds the decision-making timeline.
  210: The page highlights the need to improve the communication of uncertainty, increase
    the availability and accessibility of climate information, improve the quantitative
    basis on the cost and effectiveness of climate change adaptation, and develop
    systematic guidance tools and case studies. It also emphasizes the importance
    of understanding local capacities, governance, and preference for determining
    feasible adaptation strategies.
  212: Risk metrics alone are insufficient to predict adaptation outcomes; they must
    be placed in the local context. Many current climate risk products may fall short
    of informing adaptation decision-making.
  214: "Losses from extreme weather events have risen because of an increase in exposure;\
    \ Socio-economic developments amplify the impacts from changes in climate and\
    \ are essential to include in risk assessments; Vulnerability changes also shape\
    \ past impacts; Socio-economics are not included for many climatic hazards and\
    \ risk is simply projected forward using present socio-economic exposure and \uFB01\
    xed vulnerability"
  215: Mortality rates from storm surge floods have substantially declined in most
    world regions between 1900 and 2013, despite a strongly increasing coastal population,
    sea-level rise, and land subsidence. The highest risk of deaths from storm surge
    flooding today is located in the Pacific and Southeast Asia.
  216: Ignoring changes in vulnerability could overemphasize the effect of adaptation
    measures. Climate risk interpretation depends on the local population, development
    status, income, and capacities. Adaptation can be limited by local capacities,
    leading to soft adaptation limits even when physical/technical solutions exist.
  220: Impact chains are perceived as (1) an appropriate means for risk analysis,
    (2) a useful tool for communication of complex cause-effect relationships in climate
    change impacts and risks, and (3) a great approach to identify entry points for
    adaptation measures.
  222: Climate risk is a function of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure. Impact chains
    can be developed in a participatory manner to understand root causes of climate
    risks.
  225: Impact chains can foster discussion on adaptation demand in an early, qualitative
    stage of risk assessment; stakeholder involvement guarantees higher commitment
    and a smooth transition from risk assessment to adaptation planning.
  228: Presents an operational approach to include consideration of global change
    drivers in local policies or investment plans, to identify preferable solutions.
  229: Integrated modeling is important for assessing the performance of adaptation
    options and informing decisions about adaptation strategies.
  232: Participatory qualitative scenarios are used to create new ideas and strategies,
    clarify the options and identify future problems and opportunities.
  233: Decision support system helps decision-makers mitigate impacts of uncertainty
    and increase system adaptation and resilience. Identifies most robust solution
    that ranks best under most simulated alternative scenarios.
  236: JPI Climate aims to bring together existing and developing new excellent scientific
    knowledge that is needed to assist practitioners to adequately transform society
    towards climate resilience and consequently providing integrated climate knowledge
    and decision support services for societal innovation.
  239: Highlights the need for assessments and communication processes related to
    climate change at the European level; the establishment of Knowledge Hubs (KH)
    on climate neutrality and sea level rise; and the ambition to create a European
    Facility for Climate Change (EFCC).
  243: Presents changes in average event mortality for storm surge floods in different
    world regions between the two time periods.
Methodology:
  7: Presents results from an up-to-date overview of models and tools for climate
    change hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and adaptation assessments. Proposes practical
    approaches to conduct adaptation assessments as guidelines for decision-makers.
  11: review of climate change adaptation modelling methods and tools, development
    of guidance for application, provision of use-cases
  17: Discusses challenges in adaptation modeling, emphasizing the move from theoretical
    to applied adaptation and the need for modeling to support decision-making. Highlights
    issues like the lack of a single quantitative objective for adaptation, complex
    temporal dimensions, uncertainty related to future scenarios, and the difficulty
    in modeling the benefits of diverse adaptation actions.
  18: Discusses adaptation modelling challenges and solutions, emphasizing the need
    for integrated approaches and real-world applicability.
  19: Discusses improving climate change impact models for adaptation decisions, advocating
    for Global Sensitivity Analysis to understand model output robustness to input
    uncertainties over different projection horizons. Also recommends stress-testing
    adaptation options to evaluate project performance under climate change uncertainty
    using field experiments and model simulations.
  21: gives a targeted review on Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) with a focus
    on damage functions and adaptation modelling.
  24: The paper discusses adaptation modeling approaches within Integrated Assessment
    Models (IAMs), differentiating between implicit and explicit adaptation modelling.
  27: The authors use multi-region, multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE)
    models (top-down approaches) and the macroeconomic model GRACE, which is based
    on relationships between economic activities in countries and how they depend
    on activities in other countries.
  28: The GRACE model is a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model using
    data from the GTAP database to calibrate demand and production systems. It simulates
    interactions between sectors (Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, Energy, Transport,
    Services) and regions under market assumptions.
  30: 'Uses the GRACE model with a modified module for forest management, interpreting
    standing biomass as wealth and harvesting as the return of this wealth; considers
    three adaptation scenarios: no adaptation, adaptation in forest management, and
    adaptation in management and harvesting; estimates economic consequences of climate
    change on biomass in forests in 27 countries.'
  31: The analysis is based on interview data from 60 households in Bamrang Khola
    village, examining constraints ignored in macroeconomic models like GRACE, and
    focusing on local impacts.
  32: The analysis is performed using the GRACE model, incorporating autonomous adaptation
    strategies like air conditioner penetration and mechanization, linked to different
    SSPs.
  33: Compares and contrasts top-down (CGE models) and bottom-up modelling approaches
    for adaptation, identifies limitations of each, and suggests ways to integrate
    them. CGE models are often static or recursive-dynamic.
  35: The paper calls for a systematic assessment of the impacts of previous investments
    in climate services and identification of where and what type of investments could
    enhance the impacts.
  36: The Roadmap defines climate services as the transformation of climate-related
    data into customized products, such as projections, forecasts, information, trends,
    economic analyses, assessments, and counseling on best practices, for use by society.
  37: Stakeholder engagement workshop (November 2017) held at the request of the European
    Commission, A position paper was prepared by Climateurope (2018) summarizing deliberations
    in the form of recommendations for climate services science, research and innovation,
    Recommendations for the Horizon Europe (HEUR) framework programme on research
    needs for climate modelling and climate services, Recommendations were elaborated
    within Climateurope by a group of European experts in climate modelling and climate
    services
  38: Recommendations and research needs are derived from a workshop held in June
    2020 under the auspices of the JPI Climate ERA4CS to support the JPI Climate Strategic
    Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA).
  40: The page describes an overview of the current status and emerging challenges
    in the climate service market. It suggests a systematic assessment of remaining
    and emerging challenges related to the climate service market.
  42: Explore storyline development approaches that help in selecting relevant and
    credible pathways and events that enrich the understanding of the risks and options
    at stake. Explores two categories of storylines (climate scenario storylines and
    climate risk storylines) by discussing use cases in which these were developed.
  43: Exploration and contrast of climate scenario and climate risk storylines to
    condense climate change projections into a range relevant for impact assessment.
  44: 'Condensing the available ~250 global and regional climate change projections
    into four discrete narratives based on two elementary drivers: global warming
    level and regional response of atmospheric circulation.'
  45: "The KNMI\u201914 scenarios use four scenario storylines varying in their level\
    \ of global warming (W denoting high warming levels, G implying moderate warming)\
    \ and the response of the regional atmospheric circulation (subscript L denoting\
    \ a small change, H implying a large change)."
  48: The author suggests that comparison with historical observations alone is insufficient
    for model validation and that global sensitivity analysis provides additional
    possibilities for model evaluation to ensure greater transparency and better robustness
    of model-based analyses.
  49: The page discusses model evaluation strategies for climate impact models, emphasizing
    using historical observations to validate models and the limitations of such approaches.
  50: Global sensitivity analysis used to evaluate model elements; comparing historical
    data is insufficient, not useless. Variance-based sensitivity analysis.
  51: Time-varying global sensitivity analysis is used to determine which factors
    dominate model output uncertainty over long-term projections.
  52: The analysis employs global sensitivity analysis to examine model outputs' sensitivity
    to various parameters over time.
  53: Global sensitivity analysis is proposed as a tool to complement data- and performance-based
    validation strategies for impact models. This allows the model behavior to be
    better understood under potential future conditions, even when system response
    observations are not available. Testing models along climatic gradients is also
    suggested to understand changing model behaviour.
  54: Global sensitivity analysis can be a valuable component to strengthen confidence
    in climate change impact models. Sensitivity analysis can be performed even on
    highly complex models or on those covering a global domain.
  60: "A high-density network of air and water thermistors was installed in the Rivers\
    \ Dove and Manifold, UK, to gather data on space\u2013time variations in primary\
    \ variables; 36 test sites were chosen to represent a wide range of catchment,\
    \ channel, and bankside conditions; Long-term monitoring with modelling of shade"
  61: Empirical models can be fit to field data and extrapolated under climate change
    scenarios. Plot-scale or laboratory experiments can manipulate environmental factors.
    Systems modeling uses simulations with and without adaptations given varied inputs.
    Stress-testing of adaptation measures involves allowances for climate change and
    simulating performance metrics. Stochastic weather generation can be used.
  62: Stress-testing of physical or virtual systems under climate change, with and
    without adaptation, can reveal the efficacy of adaptations, as well as key system
    vulnerabilities and residual risks. Expert elicitation and ranking of options
    performance under different storylines may also be applied.
  63: Field experimentation under extreme weather or controlled laboratory conditions,
    systems modelling with plausible narratives of change, stress-testing with long-term
    monitoring, evaluation, and learning.
  65: Managing uncertainty in agricultural projections using a combination of techniques
    to identify uncertainties, exclude unviable outcomes, consider possible futures
    probabilistically, and select the most robust projections for adaptation.
  68: Uses Impact Response Surfaces (IRS) and Adaptation Response Surfaces (ARS) to
    depict the response of crop yield to combined changes in P and T, with and without
    adaptation. Develops an Ensemble Outcome Agreement (EOA) index to assess the confidence
    of adaptation decisions. Multi-model ensembles (MME) are used to evaluate the
    level of agreement between outcomes.
  72: The paper describes methods using stress tests to analyze vulnerability and
    model climate and socioeconomic driver sensitivity, with specific approaches for
    flood risk analyses and crop sensitivity to climate and soil-hydrology changes.
  73: The paper presents a generic approach to modeling disaster risk reduction measures
    in coastal areas, which includes considerations of climate change effects and
    can be adapted to any coastal region.
  74: The paper presents models for estimating the impacts of coastal storms using
    empirical formulations and simple analytical models, considering factors like
    offshore wave conditions, beach slope, and sea level.
  75: The analysis uses process-based models like XBeach for coastal erosion and overwash,
    and XBeach coupled with LISFLOOD for marine flooding.
  77: DRR assessment can be performed ex-ante. Models are rerun with future climate
    scenarios (e.g., wave height, total sea-level) as input variables for defined

    highlighting the potential for insurers to influence behavior through pricing
    and contract terms.
  196: The study mentions the role of credit insurers in climate change adaptation
    through risk assessment and support for insured parties. It also discusses the
    potential for flexible premium payments or lower deductibles from credit insurers
    following a disaster.
  197: "Premiums may become unaffordable or insurers\u2019 financial capacity may\
    \ be lacking to cover for losses arising from climate change if no adaptation\
    \ measures are being taken."
