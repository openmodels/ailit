Drivers of Risk:
  1: Growing water demand, socioeconomic scenarios (SSP1, SSP2, SSP3)
  3: Aridity, limited alternative water sources, and socioeconomic factors influencing
    water demand (population, GDP, water use efficiency).
  9: Hyper-arid coastal regions experiencing water scarcity and economic growth increasing
    water demand.
  10: Climate change and socioeconomic factors like income growth drive changes in
    seawater desalination needs and distribution.
  11: "Increased water demand due to GDP per person growth exceeding a threshold of\
    \ 14000 USD PPP person\u22121 yr\u22121 in certain regions."
  14: Climate change (specifically growing water demand in arid regions), socioeconomic
    conditions (income growth), and the relative cost of desalination versus alternative
    water sources.
Highlights:
  1: Usage of seawater desalination will expand considerably; Production of desalinated
    water will increase significantly; Estimated global costs for desalination production
    are quantified as a percentage of global GDP
  3: The study focuses on the potential role of seawater desalination in addressing
    water scarcity, particularly in arid regions. It utilizes socioeconomic and climate
    scenarios to project future water demand and assess the potential contribution
    of desalination.
  9: The SDM model effectively reproduces regions relying on seawater desalination
    and reasonably captures the total global volume of desalination. The model's limitations
    stem from data scarcity and model simplicity.
  10: Growth in desalination is primarily attributed to increased water demand due
    to climate change and income growth; highest volumes projected under SSP3 due
    to higher water demand.
  11: "MENA projected to produce the largest desalination volume; costs are higher\
    \ in MENA representing 0.032\u20130.306% of regional GDP."
  14: Desalination is presented as a practical engineering measure for meeting growing
    water demand in arid regions and for adapting to climate change. Income growth
    plays a primary role in the expansion of desalination plants.
Methodology:
  1: "Developed a model to estimate areas where seawater desalination is likely to\
    \ be used and the volume of production; Model is designed to be incorporated into\
    \ global hydrological models (GHMs); Applied the model to historical year 2005\
    \ and future periods (2011\u20132040 and 2041\u20132070)"
  3: The study uses a model applicable to the global domain for long-term water scarcity
    projections, incorporating data from major seawater desalination plants, socioeconomic
    pathways (SSPs) for population and GDP, historical water use data from AQUASTAT,
    and climate projections from a global climate model (MIROC4-ESM-CHEM). It analyzes
    desalination production and usage at national and subnational levels, considering
    aridity conditions and distances to plants and cities.
  9: The study uses a Seawater Desalination Model (SDM and SDM2) to simulate and validate
    desalination capacity and production. Validation is based on geographical extent
    of areas using desalination (AUSD), total desalinated water production, and temporal
    changes in production. The models' results are compared with AQUASTAT and MDPS
    (2016) data on municipal and industrial water withdrawal.
  10: Future desalination projections are based on scenarios using a Spatial Dynamic
    Model (SDM) with varying socioeconomic pathways (SSPs).
  11: The economic cost of seawater desalination estimated using costs per unit production
    based on 186 global plants; regional analysis informed by GDP and aridity thresholds.
  14: 'The study developed two models: (1) identifying climatic and socioeconomic
    conditions common to areas with seawater desalination to reproduce present AUSD
    cells; (2) using the SDM and SSP socioeconomic scenarios to project future desalination
    water production globally. Applicable when assessing future water demand and desalination
    production under different socioeconomic scenarios.'
More Notes:
  1: The large spreads in projections are primarily attributable to variations within
    the socioeconomic scenarios (SSP1, SSP2, SSP3).
  3: The study excludes plants with erroneous data, focusing on 559 large plants that
    account for 81% of the total capacity of active seawater desalination plants.
    It considers three socioeconomic scenarios (SSP1, SSP2, and SSP3) to project future
    water withdrawal.
  9: The study acknowledges uncertainties in its results due to data limitations and
    model simplicity. The discrepancies between AQUASTAT data and inferred water withdrawal
    based on economic growth in UAE suggest potential data quality issues.
  10: Regions such as MENA are highlighted as significant contributors to desalination
    production, with potential variations depending on technological advancements
    in areas like CSP desalination.
