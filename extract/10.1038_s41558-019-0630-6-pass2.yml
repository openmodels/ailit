Drivers of Risk:
  3: Extreme droughts amplified by climate change are projected to have an increasingly
    strong impact on terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) over the 21st century.
  5: Increase in frequency of extreme and moderate droughts under future climate scenarios
    (RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5).
  6: Increased frequency of extreme drought events, low humidity, low precipitation,
    high temperature, high radiation, increased carbon release from fire disturbances.
  7: Emission scenarios RCP8.5 and RCP4.5, droughts (mild, moderate, extreme), changes
    in environmental drivers (PASW, temperature, humidity, radiation, vegetation states),
    CO2 fertilization.
  8: Droughts of varying intensity (mild, moderate, extreme), CO2 concentration.
  9: Drought, warming climate, and insect dynamics influence carbon cycles and tree
    mortality.
  13: Drought defined by plant available soil water (PASW) impacting gross primary
    productivity (GPP).
  19: Droughts
Highlights:
  3: "The frequency and impact of extreme droughts are projected to nearly triple\
    \ the reduction in GPP by 2075\u20132099 when compared to the historical period,\
    \ under both high and intermediate greenhouse gas emission scenarios."
  5: Extreme droughts are projected to become significantly more frequent under future
    climate scenarios.
  6: The increasing impact of drought upon GPP mainly resulted from the increased
    frequency of drought events, especially extreme droughts.
  7: Extreme droughts are projected to significantly increase their contribution to
    total GPP reduction by the end of the 21st century. While overall GPP is projected
    to increase due to CO2 fertilization, extreme droughts are still expected to have
    a significant negative impact on GPP relative to the overall increase.
  8: Extreme droughts are projected to have a significantly larger impact on GPP in
    the future. Tropical and temperate regions are projected to experience larger
    GPP reductions due to droughts than high-latitude regions.
  9: ESMs project an increase of mean GPP and an increase of variability in GPP in
    the future. The high risk of increasing impact of extreme droughts on GPP could
    be mitigated by positive impacts on GPP in the future under favorable environmental
    conditions of temperature, soil moisture, and radiation.
  13: The study quantifies drought impacts on GPP by analyzing the deviation of GPP
    during drought months from a smooth spline representing mean GPP.
  19: The magnitude of GPP reduction due to droughts is projected to change in the
    future (2075-2099) relative to the historical period (1850-1999). Spatial distribution
    of GPP anomalies is shown.
Methodology:
  3: Analysis based on outputs from 13 Earth System Models (ESMs) to evaluate the
    impact of extreme and moderate droughts on global GPP.
  5: Droughts are defined based on plant accessible soil water (PASW) falling below
    certain percentiles (10th, 5th, and 2nd) of historical data (1850-1999). GPP during
    drought months is compared to non-drought months to ensure drought definition
    validity. Future droughts are sorted into categories using grid-cell-, model-,
    and month-specific historical simulations. The drought-associated change in GPP
    is calculated based on deviations from the mean for each month of a specific location
    during 1850-2099.
  6: The analysis projects future drought events and associated reductions in GPP
    under different climate change scenarios (RCP8.5 and RCP4.5) and examines the
    changes in GPP reductions under different drought conditions.
  7: Earth system model projections were used to project GPP reductions associated
    with droughts under different emission scenarios (RCP8.5 and RCP4.5) for the period
    2075-2099 compared to the historical period (1850-1999). The analysis includes
    CO2 fertilization effects. The contribution of various environmental drivers to
    GPP reduction was also assessed.
  8: The study projects drought impacts on Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) under
    RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios for the period 2075-2099, relative to a
    historical period of 1850-1999.
  13: Droughts are defined based on PASW and its impact on GPP. A smooth spline is
    fitted to GPP simulations to represent mean GPP. The deviation of actual GPP during
    drought months from the spline is used to quantify the drought's impact. Impacts
    are summed across months and spatial locations to estimate the global impact of
    drought on GPP. Standard errors are also estimated.
  19: "Analysis uses 13 Earth system models to project GPP anomalies associated with\
    \ droughts during 2075\u20132099 relative to the historical period of 1850\u2013\
    1999. Bootstrap sampling is used to test the significance of changes in mean GPP\
    \ reduction."
More Notes:
  3: Results indicate a high risk to the global carbon cycle from extreme droughts,
    but this risk can potentially be mitigated by positive anomalies of GPP under
    favorable environmental conditions.
  5: The study focuses on the impact of droughts on Gross Primary Productivity (GPP).
  6: The paper focuses on the impact of drought on Gross Primary Productivity (GPP),
    but does not directly address macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes at a national level.
    The drought risks are particularly high for the Amazon, South Africa, Mediterranean
    Basin, Australia, and southwest USA.
  7: The analysis focuses on GPP, which is a component of ecosystem productivity.
    It does not directly quantify macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, although GPP reductions
    could have implications for agriculture, forestry, and related sectors, which
    in turn could affect national economies.
  8: The beneficial impact of higher CO2 concentrations on plant production during
    mild and moderate droughts may partially offset the negative impacts of droughts
    on GPP under RCP 8.5. The magnitude of extreme-drought-associated GPP reduction
    increases faster than the mean GPP in the future.
  13: The analysis focuses on the impact of drought, as defined by PASW impacting
    GPP, and aggregates this to a global scale. The CMIP5 database only had single
    total GPP for each grid cell.

Quantitative material:
  6: Global Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) reductions associated with droughts will
    rise from ~2.8 Pg C per year during 1850-1999 to ~4.5 and ~4.7 Pg C per year during
    2075-2099 under emission scenarios RCP8.5 and RCP4.5, respectively (p-value <0.01).
  7: "Extreme droughts are projected to cause a ~56% and 49% contribution to total\
    \ GPP reduction during 2075\u20132099 under RCP 8.5 and RCP4.5, respectively,\
    \ compared to ~28% during 1850\u20131999. Globally-averaged mean GPP is projected\
    \ to be ~50% and ~31% higher for 2075\u20132099 compared to 1850\u20131999 under\
    \ RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5, respectively, due to CO2 fertilization and higher temperatures\
    \ at high latitudes. The GPP reduction associated with extreme droughts was projected\
    \ to increase by a factor of ~2.9 (p < 0.001) and ~2.7 (p < 0.001) under emission\
    \ scenarios of RCP8.5 and RCP4.5, respectively, compared to their historical mean\
    \ values during 1850\u20131999."
  8: The percentage reduction in GPP due to droughts is projected to increase from
    ~1.8% per year (1850-1999) to ~2.3% per year (2075-2099) (p-value < 0.01). Extreme
    droughts are projected to double the percentage reduction in GPP (p-value < 0.001)
    under both RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 scenarios.
