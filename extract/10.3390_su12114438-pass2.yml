Drivers of Risk:
  1: GDP, public debt, population, agricultural coverage and sociopolitical and institutional
    conditions
  2: The analysis highlights key drivers such as agriculture severely impacted by
    climate change, economic burden due to poor communities' higher exposure to weather
    changes, and the role of political stability and institutional effectiveness in
    climate change adaptation.
  3: The paper explores the impact of indicators such as GDP, public debt, population,
    agricultural coverage, and sociopolitical and institutional conditions on climate
    vulnerability.
  5: Covariates of GDPC, EDLT, PD, NODAC, POP, PD, UPOP, AGR, FOR, MYS, PS, GE, RQ,
    PR and CL are level 1 predictors.
  8: Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI), Electricity Dependence Level to total (EDLT),
    Percentage of forest area (FOR), Percentage of agricultural land (AGRI), Population
    density (POPD), Urban population (UPOP), Rural population (POP), Mean years of
    schooling (MYS), Political stability (PS), Government effectiveness (GE), Regulatory
    quality (RQ), Property rights (PR), Control of corruption (CL), Percentage of
    deforested area (PD), Number of Disasters Affecting Country (NODAC)
  10: Public debt accumulation (PD), official development assistance (NODAc), total
    population (POP), population density (POPD), agricultural land use (AGR) all lead
    to increased vulnerability levels
Highlights:
  1: Country-level climate change vulnerability is responding (strongly) to the majority
    of the explanatory variables considered; less-developed countries demonstrate
    increased vulnerability compared to the developed ones and those in transition
    stages
  2: The study's primary aim is to explore how different macro-level characteristics
    affect national climate change vulnerability using the ND-GAIN CVI.
  8: 'CVI (Climate Vulnerability Index) is significantly negatively correlated with
    GDPC (GDP), indicating that higher climate vulnerability is associated with lower
    GDP. GDPC is correlated at the 1% significance level with: CVI, ELDT, PD, MYS,
    PS, GE, and RQ.'
  10: Economic growth (GDPc), demographic transition from rural to urban areas (UPOP),
    human capital development in terms of educational attainment (MYS) as well as
    formal institutional arrangements (PS, GE and RQ) all contribute to reduced vulnerability
    to climate change; public debt accumulation (PD), official development assistance
    (NODAc) total population (POP) and population density (POPD) as well area dynamics
    in terms of agricultural land use (AGR), all lead to increased vulnerability levels
Methodology:
  1: "Hierarchical linear multilevel modeling approach using the Notre Dame Global\
    \ Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN) Climate Change Vulnerability Index as the dependent\
    \ variable; 1995\u20132016 annual time series panel dataset of 192 countries"
  2: The study employs the ND-GAIN Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CVI) as a dependent
    variable to explore how country-level indices influence vulnerability.
  3: The analysis employs a hierarchical linear multilevel model to examine the effects
    of explanatory variables on country-level climate vulnerability.
  4: The HLM model accounts for the nested structure of the data, leading to more
    efficient and valid estimates by considering within-variable correlations.
  5: Linear mixed effects hierarchical models are used. The analysis involves fitting
    a null model and then adding blocks of predictor variables (country, macroeconomic
    stability, population dynamics, institutional maturity and efficiency) and using
    likelihood ratio tests to compare nested models. R software and the lme4 library
    are used.
  8: Correlation analysis. Significance levels are reported (1% and 5%).
  10: 3-level hierarchical linear multilevel model
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on vulnerability, which is related to macroeconomic and macro-fiscal
    risks, but does not directly quantify the economic costs and benefits of adaptation.
  2: The study emphasizes a multi-dimensional approach to understanding vulnerability,
    considering ecological, economic, and human capital dimensions.
  8: The table shows pairwise correlations between the listed variables. Correlation
    does not imply causation. The meaning of the abbreviations (e.g., CVI, EDLT, etc.)
    is not defined on this page.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  2: The paper explores the national climate change vulnerability using ND-GAIN Climate
    Change Vulnerability Index (CVI) to inform decision-making and facilitate adaptation
    planning.
  5: Vulnerability (yijk) is the continuous estimation variable of vulnerability
  8: GDP (GDPC)
  10: Country-level climate change vulnerability (CVI)
Quantitative material:
  1: No relevant information
  2: No specific quantitative information on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes is provided.
  8: Correlation coefficients between CVI, GDPC, EDLT, PD, NODAC, POP, POPD, UPOP,
    AGRI, FOR, MYS, PS, GE, RQ, PR, and CL are presented in a correlation matrix.
  10: PD has a positive effect on the CVI (beta= 0.0054; p-value< 0.05). NODAC (beta=
    0.0071; p-value< 0.05), POP (beta= 0.000106; p-value< 0.05), POPD (beta= 0.0034;
    p-value< 0.05) and AGR (beta= 0.0012; p-value< 0.05) also have positive effects
    on CVI.
