Drivers of Risk:
  2: No relevant information
  3: Global temperature change above pre-industrial.
  5: Fires, storms, accidents due to human error (normal accidental damage); major
    earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tidal waves or exceptionally severe hurricanes
    (infrequent major natural disasters).
  6: Extreme weather events becoming more frequent
  7: Hurricanes Katrina and Rita
  8: Disasters include floods, storms, fires, droughts, and heat waves.
  9: Not explicitly stated, but implied to be weather/climate-related events captured
    in NOAA data.
  10: Billion-dollar weather and climate disasters are named as drivers impacting
    economic outcomes.
  15: Major earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tidal waves, exceptionally severe hurricanes,
    drought and other natural disasters; acts of war, riots and other political events;
    and technological accidents.
Evaluation overview:
  2: No relevant information
  3: Economic impact estimates associated with different levels of global warming.
  5: Losses of fixed assets due to normal accidental damage, losses of fixed assets
    due to infrequent major natural disasters.
  6: Asset damage from weather and climate disasters
  7: No relevant information
  9: BEA and NOAA costs
  10: The paper assesses the impact of billion-dollar weather and climate disasters
    on economic metrics like Net Domestic Product (NDP) and Consumption of Fixed Capital
    (CFC).
  15: Volume changes recorded as catastrophic losses in the other changes in the volume
    of assets account.
Highlights:
  2: No relevant information
  3: As global temperature change increases, the economic impact appears to become
    more severe, depicted by the rising trends in the graphs.
  5: Normal accidental damage is treated differently than infrequent major natural
    disasters in economic accounting.
  6: Extreme weather events are more frequent and likely to become more so; Scientific
    progress has made these events more predictable
  7: Including full disaster costs in CFC introduces volatility; using a trend is
    proposed as a proxy for expected costs.
  9: Real value (BEA and NOAA costs) is increasing over time; Raw data shows substantial
    volatility; Trend result is robust.
  10: The economic impact of weather and climate disasters on fixed capital and net
    domestic product is increasing over time.
Methodology:
  2: No relevant information
  3: Statistical modeling, structural modeling, meta analyses, and AR5 various methods
  5: Distinguishes between normal, expected accidental damage (treated as consumption
    of fixed capital) and infrequent major natural disasters (recorded in the other
    changes in the volume of assets account).
  6: The trend for asset damage from weather and climate disasters should be included
    in consumption of capital rather than Other Changes in the Volume of Assets
  7: Compares the US BEA's prior (pre-2008 SNA) method of including full disaster
    costs in Capital Fixed Consumption (CFC) with a proposed method of including only
    the trend.
  8: Both NOAA and BEA data can be used to estimate asset costs of disasters, with
    NOAA roughly 2/3 capital loss and BEA covering larger scale events.
  9: Uses a trend analysis, finding the result is robust to different methods for
    calculating the trend. Data is deflated by CPI-U to 2023 US Dollars.
  15: Identifies large-scale, discrete, and recognizable events that destroy a significantly
    large number of assets.
More Notes:
  2: No relevant information
  3: The graphic is from IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (2022).
  7: SNA refers to System of National Accounts; BEA refers to Bureau of Economic Analysis
  9: BEA and NOAA costs are used as a proxy for the direct climate impacts.
Quantitative material:
  2: No relevant information
  3: Displays graphs with economic impact estimates for different temperature change
    scenarios using statistical modeling, structural modeling, meta-analyses, and
    AR5 methods.
  7: quarterly annualised CFC fell by 5.8% in Q2 2005, and rose by 18.9% Q3
  9: Real midpoint costs and Real Midpoint Trend in billions of 2023 US Dollars, deflated
    by CPI-U; figure shows costs increasing over time with substantial volatility.
  10: The portion of NDP from billion-dollar disaster costs increased from 0.12% in
    1980 to 0.40% in 2023; the portion of adjusted CFC constituted by disaster costs
    was 0.67% in 1980 and 1.95% in 2013.
