Drivers of Risk:
  3: Global temperature change above pre-industrial levels.
  6: More frequent extreme weather events becoming more normal.
  7: Disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
  9: Climate events (implied by the mention of BEA and NOAA costs).
  10: Billion-dollar weather and climate disasters.
  11: No relevant information
  15: Catastrophic losses from natural disasters, political events, and technological
    accidents can destroy a large number of assets.
Highlights:
  3: Higher global temperatures are generally associated with negative economic impacts.
    Projected future temperatures and their economic impacts vary significantly based
    on different socioeconomic scenarios (SSP scenarios).
  6: The paper highlights the increasing frequency and predictability of extreme weather
    events and proposes a change in accounting methodology to reflect the impact of
    these events on asset value.
  7: Including full disaster costs introduces volatility into measures of capital
    consumption.
  9: Real costs are increasing over time; raw data is volatile; using a trend is important;
    the trend calculation is robust.
  10: Disaster costs as a percentage of NDP were relatively small but growing, with
    an increase from 0.12% in 1980 to 0.40% in 2023.

Methodology:
  3: Statistical modeling, structural modeling, meta-analyses, and various methods
    (AR5) are used to estimate economic impacts. The results are applicable to global
    aggregate economic impacts at different global warming levels.
  6: Proposal to change the System of National Accounts (SNA) to include asset damage
    from weather/climate disasters in consumption of capital.
  7: Compares the impact on capital consumption figures depending on whether disaster
    costs are included as shocks versus including the trend of disaster costs.
  8: NOAA data includes floods, storms, fires, droughts, and heat waves.
  9: Calculates a trend of the average annual midpoint of BEA and NOAA costs; the
    trend calculation is robust to different methods.

More Notes:
  3: The page emphasizes the feedback loop between economic activity and the environment
    and the need for macroeconomic statistics to reflect this relationship.
  6: The paper suggests extreme weather events are becoming more predictable due to
    scientific progress.
  8: NOAA data does not include mortality, morbidity, or indirect costs like business
    interruption.
  15: The page discusses various events leading to macroeconomic and macro-fiscal
    losses but does not provide specific quantitative outcomes or methodological details.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Percentage change in global aggregate economic impact (both loss and gain).
  6: Asset damage from weather and climate disasters.
  7: Capital consumption falls as a result of disaster costs.
  9: Average annual midpoint of BEA and NOAA costs related to climate events, in billions
    of 2023 US dollars, deflated by CPI-U.
  10: Considers the impact of billion-dollar weather and climate disasters as a percentage
    of Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFC) and Net Domestic Product (NDP).
  11: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  3: "Estimates of percentage change in global aggregate economic impact for temperature\
    \ changes ranging from 0\xB0C to 7\xB0C, displayed in multiple subgraphs and associated\
    \ trendlines."
  7: Quarterly annualized CFC fell by 5.8% in Q2 2005, and rose by 18.9% Q3 (associated
    with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita).
  8: Estimates asset costs of disasters as roughly 2/3 of NOAA data or double BEA
    data.
  9: Figure 6 shows costs in billions of 2023 US dollars over time; raw data is volatile;
    trend is increasing over time; costs are derived from BEA and NOAA data.
  10: Provides quantitative data on disaster costs and trends as a percent of NDP
    from 1980 to 1985, and from 2015 to 2023.
