Changes in mean climate are a greater source of risk than variability; adaptation targeting mean changes is more effective. The exact value is not provided here, but is assessed to be a positive number given avoided impact."

Changes in mean climate are a greater source of risk than variability; adaptation targeting mean changes is more effective. Refers to potential damages exceeding those of the 2012 event. The exact value is not provided here, but is assessed to be a positive number given economic benefit."
