Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in land use, vulnerability, exposure, heavy rainfalls.
  2: Floods (including flash floods) driven by intense precipitation; initial soil
    moisture conditions; rainfall intensity; runoff coefficient variability due to
    complex interactions between precipitation, land use, vulnerability, and exposure.
  5: Floods, particularly hydrometeorological floods, are identified as a socio-natural
    hazard, meaning their occurrence is increased due to land and environmental degradation.
  7: Precipitation is expected to decrease with rising temperatures, notably a 4%
    decline per degree Celsius increase, especially impacting the South.
Drives of Risk:
  7: An increase in heavy rains in the northern Mediterranean is anticipated, heightening
    flood risks, while southern regions face more frequent droughts.
Highlights:
  1: Floods in this region are mainly a consequence of flash-flood events; a common
    positive trend of flash floods in the past probably due to land use changes and
    the occupation of flood-prone areas has been found (high confidence); vulnerabilities
    to water-related hazards are expected to be influenced by the future socio-economic
    conditions at the regional scale (medium confidence); flood impacts will increase
    in the entire Mediterranean region, mainly as a consequence of global changes
    in the catchments (land use, vulnerability, exposure), joined in the Northern
    part of the basin to the increase of heavy rainfalls (medium confidence).
  2: Floods are the natural risk with the greatest impact globally due to their frequency
    and socioeconomic and environmental losses.
  5: The paper highlights the increased occurrence of floods as socio-natural hazards
    due to land and environmental degradation.
Methodology:
  1: Synthesis of the state of the art, with particular incidence in the first results
    of MedECC and the most recent bibliography on floods trend.
  2: No relevant information
  5: Risk is defined as the combination of the probability of a hazard event and its
    negative consequences. This is used to build risk maps based on hazard and vulnerability
    factors, often with a color code matrix.
More Notes:
  1: Paper focuses on floods in the Mediterranean region and their causes and impacts,
    with an emphasis on flash floods. It doesn't directly address macroeconomic or
    macro-fiscal implications, but it does highlight the increasing impacts of floods.
  2: The paper acknowledges multiple factors influencing flood impacts, including
    rainfall characteristics, water flow, evacuation means, and awareness.
  5: The paper provides a framework for categorizing hazards and defines key terms
    like 'vulnerability'. It also describes a method for creating risk maps based
    on hazard and vulnerability.
