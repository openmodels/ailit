Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased heavy precipitation and flooding events leading to excess soil moisture.
  2: Flooding and excess precipitation are identified as significant risks impacting
    crop yields.
  3: Excess soil moisture, simulated using a modified CERES-Maize model that incorporates
    a damage function limiting root growth after three consecutive days of soil saturation.
  4: Impacts on yield due to excess soil moisture, driven by extreme precipitation
    events that are projected to increase under climate change scenarios.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Crop production losses due to increased heavy precipitation and flooding, focusing
    on US corn production.
  2: The paper investigates the potential damages to agricultural production from
    flooding and excess soil moisture, particularly under climate change.
  3: Crop yield loss due to excess soil moisture.
  4: The paper evaluates the impact of excess soil moisture on US maize yields, noting
    that the negative effects are low over the long term under the current climate
    regime but could increase significantly under climate change scenarios.
Highlights:
  1: Increased heavy precipitation may cause US corn production losses to double,
    resulting in $3 billion per year in additional damages.
  2: Despite increased risk of crop losses due to flooding and excess precipitation
    with climate change, damages remain under-quantified due to limitations in current
    dynamic crop models.
  3: The modified CERES-Maize model improved yield predictions in years characterized
    by high precipitation during the growing season, and was able to simulate the
    yield anomaly observed during the 1993 US Midwest floods, which the original model
    could not. The modified model predicts a 23% yield reduction at the calibration
    site due to the 1993 floods.
  4: US maize production losses due to extreme precipitation events could nearly double
    by 2030; projected annual agricultural losses from increased precipitation could
    reach $3 billion by 2030.
Methodology:
  1: A dynamic crop model is modified to simulate the effect of heavy precipitation
    on crop growth, specifically plant damage from excess soil moisture. The analysis
    is applicable to the next thirty years.
  2: The analysis employs a modified CERES-Maize model to simulate crop damage due
    to excess soil moisture, focusing on nine sites in the American Midwest.
  3: The CERES-Maize crop model was modified to simulate negative effects on maize
    growth and yield caused by excess soil moisture by introducing a damage function
    that limited root growth after three consecutive days of soil saturation. The
    modified model was calibrated using county-level yields for the period 1951-1998
    at Des Moines, IA. Simulations were conducted at nine sites in the US Corn Belt.
    The difference in yields predicted by the original and modified models indicates
    yield reduction due to excess soil moisture.
  4: The analysis uses GCM climate change scenarios from the Hadley and Canadian Climate
    Centres, extending the US National Assessment methodology to simulate excess soil
    moisture impacts on maize yields.
Quantitative material:
  1: US corn production losses may double in the next thirty years, causing an estimated
    $3 billion per year in additional damages.
  2: Federal disaster-related payments in the US amounted to $119 billion from 1993
    to 1997, with crop insurance losses growing tenfold in recent decades.
  3: The modified CERES-Maize model computed a 23% reduction of yield in 1993 at Des
    Moines, IA, compared to the original model, due to excess soil moisture. Average
    damage for all sites was 3%.
  4: The modified model projects that the probability of damage due to excess soil
    moisture could be 90% greater by 2030 and 150% greater by 2090 compared to present
    conditions.
