Drivers of Risk:
  1: Large cyclonic storm surges, global climate change, population growth, and economic
    development
  2: Storm surges caused by tropical cyclones are identified as drivers of risk.
  4: Storm surges are the primary driver of risk. The intensity of storm surge is
    related to the yearly maximum water level.
  5: Tropical cyclones cause storm surges that lead to increased water levels.
  6: The primary drivers of risk highlighted are storm surges, particularly those
    triggered by tropical cyclones affecting global coastal zones.
  7: Storm surges are the primary shocks impacting outcomes.
  8: The primary driver of risk is storm surge intensity, measured by the yearly expected
    value of maximum relative water level rise at each tide gauge.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Potential impacts on global population and economy from storm surge
  2: The study aims to assess potential storm surge impacts on global populations
    and economies.
  4: The paper evaluates the impact of storm surges on global population and economy,
    specifically related to the inundation area.
  5: The paper evaluates potential inundated area, affected population, and affected
    GDP due to storm surges.
  6: This page discusses the spatial distribution of risk, particularly economic losses
    in certain coastal areas, and includes a country ranking of risk in terms of inundated
    areas, affected population, and GDP loss.
  7: Potential impacts of storm surges on global populations and economies are evaluated.
  8: This study focuses on the economic and population impacts of storm surges globally,
    specifically inundation area, affected population, and affected GDP.
Highlights:
  1: Provides a preliminary outlook on risks that may help governments of countries
    to make storm surge disaster prevention and reduction plans.
  4: The paper focuses on estimating the probability of storm surge intensity and
    the potential inundated area using a combination of tide gauge records, information
    diffusion methods, and GIS analysis.
  5: Areas with high potential affected population are located in the Caribbean region,
    the Bay of Bengal, and East Asia.
  7: Inundated coastal areas due to storm surges show significant correlation with
    global population and GDP impacts.
  8: The study identifies countries most at risk from storm surges in terms of inundated
    area, affected population, and affected GDP. Top countries for each area include
    Australia, United States, Mexico, Bangladesh, Cuba and India for inundated area,
    Bangladesh, India, China, Vietnam, United States and Sri Lanka for affected population,
    and United States, China, Japan, Australia, and Ireland for affected GDP.
Methodology:
  1: Projects potential inundated area of global coastal zones using information diffusion
    theory, based on historical hourly sea-level observation records from the University
    of Hawaii Sea Level Center (UHSLC), considering variations in coastal morphology
    and tropical cyclone tracks.
  2: The study uses information diffusion theory and global databases to analyze storm
    surge intensity and impacts, including the use of GIS tools for mapping affected
    populations and economies.
  4: The paper uses a diffusion function and GIS analysis (inverse distance weighted
    interpolation) to extrapolate the expected annual maximum of relative water level
    rise (storm surge intensity) and to calculate the potential maximum inundated
    area. The information diffusion method is used to obtain the probability distribution
    curve of the relative water level.
  5: The potential maximum inundated distance is calculated from the slope dataset
    with Eq. (8). Potential maximum inundated area at the global scale is delineated
    by using the area-altitude analysis in ArcGIS. The global population and GDP that
    can be potentially affected by storm surges are calculated by superimposing the
    global population density and GDP distribution data on the inundated area map.
  6: The study uses historical storm surge disaster records from the Global Risk Data
    Platform (GRDP) to assess risk and validate results through a comparison of country
    rankings.
  8: The study simulates potential annual maximum inundation areas based on the yearly
    expected value of maximum relative water level rise, then calculates the population
    and GDP potentially affected. The methodology uses historical storm surge losses
    to validate the results. The study acknowledges the limitations of not including
    shoreline protection and natural coastal protective features.
More Notes:
  1: Storm surge in this article refers to the combination of mean sea level, tidal
    wave, and storm surge
  4: The paper emphasizes the importance of considering the complexity of the coastal
    environment and uneven distribution of tidal stations when assessing storm surge
    impacts. The length of tide gauge records is considered (Fig. 2).
  8: The study highlights the absence of a global database on shoreline protection
    as a limitation and suggests future work should incorporate the effects of man-made
    and natural coastal protection measures.
Quantitative material:
  1: Calculates and maps population and GDP at risk of storm surge impacts
  4: The paper uses equations to calculate various parameters related to water level
    and probability, like yearly maximum water levels datasets (Hmax), annual maximum
    relative water level (Hrelative), probability distribution curve of Hrelative,
    and exceedance probability. It assumes maximum relative water level is 5m for
    calculation.
  5: "Maximum relative water level rise is mainly in the 60\u2013160 cm range, with\
    \ the total number of stations of 224, 71 % of all stations."
  6: The analysis provides data on potential inundated area, affected population,
    and GDP loss, along with a map indicating maximum relative water level rise in
    global coastal zones.
  7: Correlation coefficients of 0.72, 0.47, and 0.57 are provided for global inundation,
    population impact, and GDP impact respectively at the 0.01 confidence level.
  8: The study provides rankings of countries based on potential inundated area, affected
    population, and affected GDP due to storm surges. The paper also includes a map
    visualizing GDP density globally.
