Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global climate change, population growth, and economic development, specifically
    large cyclonic storm surges.
  3: Storm surge events triggered by tropical cyclones.
  4: Storm surges
  5: Storm surges; Tropical cyclones; Maximum relative water level rise; Inundated
    area
  6: Storm surges, especially those triggered by tropical cyclones, are drivers of
    risk.
  7: Storm surges associated with extreme precipitation and strong winds.
  8: Storm surges and their intensity impact macroeconomic factors like GDP.
Highlights:
  1: Provides a preliminary outlook on risks that may help governments of countries
    to make storm surge disaster prevention and reduction plans.
  4: The paper focuses on estimating storm surge intensity and potential inundated
    area, but does not provide specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  5: High risk areas for population exposure to storm surges are located in the Caribbean
    region, the Bay of Bengal, and East Asia; Higher economic losses will be encountered
    following rapid economic development of a country.
  6: High economic losses are mainly distributed in some coastal areas of England,
    other developed countries in Europe, the Yangtze River Delta in China, the eastern
    coast of the United States, and the Gulf of Mexico.
  7: Storm surge disasters are usually associated with extreme precipitation and strong
    winds and pose a risk to populations and economies.
  8: Global storm surge risks affect GDP in countries like the United States, China,
    and Bangladesh.
Methodology:
  1: Information diffusion theory is used to project the potential inundated area
    of global coastal zones, based on historical hourly sea-level observation records
    from the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center (UHSLC), considering variations
    in coastal morphology and tropical cyclone tracks. Validation is performed through
    comparison with historical losses.
  3: Fuzzy information processing is used to estimate the maximum relative sea level
    from hourly sea-level data and historical tropical cyclone surge events. GIS is
    used to determine the area inundated by storm surges. A Markov chain process is
    assumed for storm surge as a stochastic process.
  4: Uses tide gauge records, diffusion functions, and GIS analysis (inverse distance
    weighted interpolation) to estimate storm surge intensity and potential inundated
    area. It models the probability distribution of relative water levels using historical
    data.
  5: Interpolating the H values at each tidal station in each zone through the inverse
    distance weighted interpolation method in ArcGIS; Calculating the potential maximum
    inundated area based on slope; Superimposing global population density and GDP
    distribution data on the inundated area map
  6: The analysis involves comparing country rankings based on GRDP data with rankings
    from their study to test the reliability of estimated inundated area and economic
    losses due to storm surges, with data of storm surges triggered by tropical cyclones
    from 1975 to 2007.
  7: The study examined the potential global impact of storm surges on populations
    and economies using available and recent global datasets from various sources.
    A sample size of 57 countries was used, with the top 10% listed in Table 2. The
    paper notes that there is no model currently capable of performing global storm
    surge simulation.
  8: Utilizes a fuzzy information processing method for calculating yearly expected
    water level rise and simulates potential impacts without protective measures.
More Notes:
  4: The study extrapolates storm surge intensity using inverse distance weighted
    interpolation, considering the complexity of the coastal environment and uneven
    distribution of tidal stations. The maximum relative water level is assumed to
    be 5m based on another study.
  5: The study calculates potential maximum inundated area, affected population, and
    affected GDP based on storm surge intensity.
  6: The study uses historical storm surge disaster records from the Global Risk Data
    Platform (GRDP).
  7: Figures 5 and 6 visually depict expected inundation areas and demographic risk
    of storm surge impact, respectively. The focus is on coastal zones.
  8: Study acknowledges the data limitations and calls for considering existing protection
    measures in future analyses.
Outcome(s) of Interest:

  5: GDP effects; potential affected GDP is calculated.
  6: Affected GDP is an outcome of interest, specifically at the country level, related
    to storm surges.

    inputs.
  4: No relevant information
  5: "Maximum relative water level rise of 300 cm or more are found along the western\
    \ European coast, northern Australia, the Gulf of Alaska, and East China Sea;\
    \ Maximum relative water level rise is mainly in the 60\u2013160 cm range, with\
    \ the total number of stations of 224, 71 % of all stations; Maximum relative\
    \ water level rise of 300 cm or higher is estimated for 17 stations, about 5.4\
    \ % of all stations."
  6: The study presents country-level statistics of potential inundated area, potential
    affected population, and potential affected GDP.
  7: Significant correlation found at the 0.01 confidence level (bilateral) between
    inundated area and population, with a correlation coefficient of 0.72. Country
    rankings of population and GDP impacts are moderately correlated at the 0.01 confidence
    level (bilateral), with correlation coefficients of 0.47 and 0.57.
