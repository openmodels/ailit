Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate variability, sudden shocks to resource availability
  2: Climate variability, extreme weather events (wildfires, droughts), pest outbreaks,
    anthropogenic climate change, harvest failures, sudden declines in export volumes
    of food (shocks).
  3: Climate variability and shocks, network topology.
  4: Climate variability, specifically variations in resource availability at nodes
    in a food trade network.
  6: Climate variability (ENSO, AMO, NAO) affecting resource availability at nodes
    in a food trade network; Sudden shocks (stoppage of food exports) to hub, peripheral,
    and median closeness centrality nodes.
  9: Resource variability, spatial autocorrelation of variability (climate variability),
    network topology (size and connectivity).
  10: Climate variability; Shocks (resource availability decreases, sudden stops in
    resource influx); Distance to shock; Centrality of the node
  11: Climate variability, specifically low amplitude high frequency (LAHF) and high
    amplitude low frequency (HALF) climate variability scenarios, is a driver of risk.
  12: Climate-induced resource variability and shocks
  13: Shock applied to a node in a food trade network; Climate variability; Restriction
    on exports in times of shortage.
  14: Long-term climate variability, shocks (unspecified nature).
  15: Climate variability (amplitude and frequency variations in food production),
    shocks to the food trade network, reliance on few import partners.
Highlights:
  1: Redistribution of resources increases carrying capacity; carrying capacity fluctuations
    depend on amplitude and frequency of resource variability; network topology is
    key factor determining carrying capacity of a node; larger networks increase carrying
    capacity and equalize resource distribution; central nodes achieve higher carrying
    capacity and are less susceptible to resource variability/shocks.
  2: Import-dependent and water-scarce countries are most vulnerable to shocks; developing
    countries experience the highest losses in import volume due to sudden decreases
    in export volume; trade networks structure can be altered after a shock; trading
    entities increase the number of trading partners; countries can increase resilience
    against shocks by increasing the number and diversity of trading partners and
    increasing food buffer stocks.
  3: Climate variability and network topology affect access to resources in a trading
    network.
  9: GEP is higher under out-of-phase variability. GEP is higher under lower amplitude
    and lower frequency of variability. Larger network size reduces the difference
    in NEP between the most and least populated nodes. Smaller networks exhibit greater
    inequality in NEP as resource variability amplitude increases.
  10: Larger small-world networks are more efficient at distributing resources among
    nodes; Central nodes are more resilient to resource availability decreases.
  11: The analysis suggests that closeness centrality is related to node equilibrium
    population (NEP) and its variability under different climate variability scenarios.
    The specifics are that nodes with higher closeness centrality tend to have a higher
    NEP, but these relationships change according to the frequency of the shocks.
  12: Central nodes have higher NEP and are less susceptible to climate-induced resource
    variability and shocks. Shocks applied to more central nodes cause more damage
    to GEP.
  13: A shock applied to a node with higher centrality leads to a larger population
    loss in the rest of the network.
  14: Increasing network size (adding trading partners) is necessary to increase resilience
    to shocks and climate variability for the whole network. A larger network is more
    efficient in redistributing resources, effectively increasing the carrying capacity
    of the network.
  15: Resource redistribution increases carrying capacities and population size when
    resource variability is out of phase between network parts. Central nodes are
    less vulnerable to resource variability and shocks due to increased accessibility
    to resources through trade. Anthropogenic climate change will result in larger
    amplitude and higher frequency variations in food production.
Methodology:
  1: Model of population growth limited by resource availability in a trading network;
    resources redistributed based on supply and distance; resource variability mimics
    changes in biomass production; perturbations applied to study resilience.
  2: Combination of empirical and modelling approaches using real-world food trade
    networks.
  3: A model is used to simulate a food distribution system of 10 and 100 nodes with
    a small-world network configuration. Population growth is simulated as a function
    of local resources and competition for resources in the network. Resources varied
    with varying amplitude and periodicity to reflect multi-annual to decadal oscillation
    in the climate system. The model runs for 1000 iterations to achieve an equilibrium
    state in every scenario.
  4: Analysis of food trade networks using small-world and undirected network models
    with 10 and 100 nodes. Resource availability at nodes varies over time in the
    form of a sine wave, with 'in phase' and 'out of phase' variability scenarios.
    A trade equation (Eq 2) is used to redistribute resources among nodes based on
    surplus.
  6: The analysis uses climate variability scenarios with sine wave resource availability
    at nodes. It models in-phase and out-of-phase climate variability. It also models
    shocks to nodes, reducing resource redistribution by 1% in a 100-node network
    and 10% in a 10-node network.
  9: The study uses a network model to simulate food trade and resource distribution
    under various climate variability scenarios. The results are applicable to understanding
    the impact of climate-driven resource shocks on population distribution and network
    resilience.
  10: Network analysis of food trade networks.
  11: Agent-based modeling is used to simulate a food trade network. The impact of
    climate variability (LAHF and HALF) on the relationship between network topology
    (closeness centrality) and node equilibrium population (NEP) is analyzed using
    regression analysis.
  12: Analysis of a food trade network, simulating shocks and examining the impact
    on node equilibrium population based on network topology and node centrality.
  13: The study uses a model to simulate a food trade network with nodes representing
    populations. Shocks are applied to nodes to simulate disruptions and the resulting
    population changes are analyzed.
  15: A model simulates resource redistribution in a small-world network to study
    the effect of climate variability, network topology, and shocks on population
    growth.
More Notes:
  2: Food trade provides a buffer against local variability in food resources; redistribution
    of resources increases the carrying capacity of a trading network; changes in
    one part of a trade network may have implications for food supply in another part.
  3: The model is generalisable and may represent countries, cities or other spatially
    constrained trading entities.
  4: The focus is on the structure and dynamics of a food trade network under different
    resource variability scenarios. The paper uses a network approach to understand
    how resource availability and trade impact the functioning of the food system.
    The page describes the setup of the model, not the results, so the relevant outcomes
    will be found in the remainder of the paper.
  6: The resource variability is modeled as a sine wave with varying amplitude (5%
    or 50% of baseline resources) and period (6 years or 70 years). The baseline resources
    are 1 million kg food resources per year.
  9: The study considers the spatial autocorrelation of resource variability to reflect
    the spatial patterns of climate variability.
  10: The study uses Node Equilibrium Population (NEP) as a measure of node health
    and Global Equilibrium Population (GEP) as a measure of overall network health.
  11: The paper analyzes a food trade network, and its resilience to climate variability
    by focusing on NEP as a proxy for network stability. This could be connected to
    national-level food security and economic stability. The model focuses on network
    topology and climate variability, without explicitly considering other macroeconomic
    and macro-fiscal variables.
  12: Trade in a small-world network can effectively deal with resource variability
    and increase carrying capacity.
  13: The study focuses on the impact of network topology and climate variability
    on the resilience of a food trade network.
  14: The paper uses a simplified model to isolate and analyse the effects of climate
    variability, network topology, and shocks on carrying capacity. The model modifies
    the gravity of trade equation by deleting demand as an input variable to avoid
    a 'rich-get-richer' feedback loop. The original gravity of trade equation is considered
    suitable for estimating short-term flows, but not for determining carrying capacity
    in an evolving network.
  15: Connectivity that trade imposes on the network needs to be managed to provide
    resilience to peripheral nodes and avoid shock propagation. Increasing trading
    partners at a node level and including more nodes in the network at a global level
    can help.

  12: "Decrease in NEP is a function of distance to the shock node (y = 335e^{-1.7x},\
    \ R\xB2 = 0.99) and closeness centrality (path distance to shock = 1: y = -3.8\

    value.
