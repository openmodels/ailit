3,Output,,,2000,Capital Stock,Proportional Reduction,-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,p.14,"Reduction in output is proportional to reduction in capital stock in the short term. This outcome is from a macroeconomic model constructed by Albala-Bertrand (1993a). This is a negative relationship, but has been converted to a value of -1."
4,Output,,,2000,Initial impact,Smaller Impact,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,p.14,"Author modifies some assumptions, considering that loss is split between capital and output, that capital loss is estimated at replacement cost, and that capital is heterogeneous, resulting in a much smaller impact on output from a one-time disaster. This outcome is from a macroeconomic model constructed by Albala-Bertrand (1993a). This is a positive relationship, but has been converted to a value of 1."
