  17: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  10: Decreased precipitation and increased PET are identified as drivers of drought
    risk.
  12: Changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration as represented by the Standardized
    Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) under different Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSPs).
  17: Decreasing precipitation in Northern and Southern Africa.
  18: Climate change, specifically different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)
    and their associated emissions scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5).
  20: Decreased precipitation, particularly in the Northern, Saharan, and Southern
    regions, along with a bigger increase in PET, have accelerated dryness in Africa.
    Rising global warming contributes to increased drought risks.
  21: Changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) leading to drought.
Highlights:
  10: Precipitation is projected to increase in WAF, CAF, and EAF by the end of the
    century, especially under SSP5-8.5. PET is generally increasing across Africa,
    with the highest levels under SSP5-8.5, especially in the Southern, Saharan, and
    Northern regions.
  12: Eastern and Southern Africa are projected to experience dryness. The Central
    region exhibits increased dryness across emission scenarios but shows wetness
    under SSP5-8.5. Under high emissions scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5), Eastern
    and Southern Africa are projected to experience the most severe increasing drought.
    Western Sahara and Western regions exhibit wetness, particularly at higher emissions.
  18: The study projects a continuous trend of increased aridity across Africa and
    its sub-regions throughout the 21st century. Models adeptly replicate historical
    drought characteristics, indicating their reliability. There will be less frequents,
    longer durations, and more intense droughts from the near to higher emission in
    the late twenty-first century.
  20: Widespread drying is indicated in the Mediterranean and southern Africa, alongside
    wetter conditions in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and eastern
    Africa.
  21: Long-term drought conditions across Africa and its sub-regions are anticipated
    to become less frequent, yet more prolonged and severe.
Methodology:
  10: "Analysis of historical drought patterns (1979-2014) and projections of precipitation\
    \ and PET under different SSP scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP5-8.5) for various timeframes\
    \ (2021\u20132040, 2041\u20132060, 2081\u20132100)."
  12: "The study uses CMIP6-projected trends for SPEI-12 for the historical period\
    \ 1995\u20132014 and projections 2015\u20132100. Sen's Slope is used to test for\
    \ trends in dryness, with a 95% confidence level for significance. Two-sample\
    \ t-tests are used to assess significance."
  17: Analysis of SPEI-12 drought index to investigate hydrological drought patterns
    in Africa from 1979 to 2014.
  18: Analysis of 20 CMIP6 GCMs to project drought frequency, duration, and intensity,
    using the SPEI drought index as a metric.
  20: "The projections of the SPEI, which combines precipitation and PET changes based\
    \ on the Penman\u2013Monteith method from various GCMs, show a consistent trend.\
    \ The SPEI drought index is used for the 2021\u20132040, 2041\u20132060 and 2081\u2013\
    2100 periods under the SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5 scenarios relative\
    \ to the historical period."
  21: The study utilizes CMIP6 data under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5
    scenarios. It employs CDF matching to correct biases in climate variables and
    uses a new model metric E to evaluate model performance. Statistical downscaling
    is performed. The analysis uses gridded observational data from 1979 to 2014 and
    future simulations from 2015 to 2100. Reference period is 1995-2014. SPEI-12 and
    Mann-Kendall trends are used to assess drought conditions.
More Notes:
  10: The study uses bias-corrected multi-model ensemble (MME) data for precipitation
    and PET projections, improving alignment with observed data.
  12: "The study analyzes SPEI relative change for different periods (2021\u20132040,\
    \ 2041\u20132060, and 2081\u20132100) under different SSPs (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5,\
    \ SSP 3\u20137.0, and SSP 5\u20138.5)."
  17: The paper relies on CMIP6 projections and GCM-simulated drought duration to
    analyze drought trends.
  18: The analysis focuses on drought attributes (frequency, duration, and intensity)
    as derived from the SPEI index and modeled climate projections.
  20: The Sahel region and the Horn of Africa will experience a drop in the chance
    of intense drought.
  21: The study focuses on hydrological drought and does not directly address macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  10: This page focuses on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) as
    key climate variables impacting drought conditions.
  12: No relevant information
  18: Implied macroeconomic outcomes are drought frequency, duration, and intensity,
    which impact multiple economic sectors.
  20: "The current CMIP6 model forecasts show a widespread escalation in drying trends,\
    \ possibly resulting in an extraordinary rise of up to 200% in drought occurrences\
    \ over important regions including the Mediterranean area, Eastern Africa, and\
    \ Southern Africa, which endangers the region\u2019s socioeconomic activity. Central\
    \ African countries growing sensitivity might increase the possibility of increased\
    \ drought impacts due to a combination of susceptibility and fast population expansion."

Quantitative material:
  10: "Historical SPEI-12 changes show a decreasing trend of -0.05/a annually from\
    \ 1979 to 2014. Regional trends from 1979 to 2014 show declining trends for NAF,\
    \ SAH, WAF, CAF, EAF and SAF by \u2212 0.06/a, \u2212 0.05/a, \u2212 0.01/a, \u2212\
    \ 0.02/a, \u2212 0.06/a, and \u2212 0.03/a, respectively."
  12: The study uses SPEI-12 to project future drought characteristics. The color
    scale in Fig. 7 ranges from -3.5 to 3.5 for SPEI values.
  18: "SPEI Drought Index values for different African sub-regions and time periods,\
    \ showing increased drought severity under future scenarios (e.g., NAF exhibits\
    \ \u2212 2.41, \u2212 3.05, and \u2212 3.23 for 2021\u20132040, 2041\u20132060\
    \ and 2081\u20132100 respectively)."
  20: Up to 200% rise in drought occurrences over important regions including the
    Mediterranean area, Eastern Africa, and Southern Africa by the end of the century,
    particularly under the SSP5-8.5 scenario.
  21: "Drought duration is projected to increase from 7.3 years (2021-2040) to 16.4\
    \ years (2041-2060) and 16.6 years (2081-2100). Drought frequency is expected\
    \ to decline from 6.4 times (near-term) to 3.6 times (long-term). Drought intensity\
    \ is projected to escalate from -1.9 (historically) to -2.6 events (long-term),\
    \ potentially reaching -3.0 in NAF and SAH under SSP5-8.5. The study identified\
    \ significant changes in SPEI-12 trends across Africa with a trend of \u2212 0.05\
    \ per year from 1979-2014."
