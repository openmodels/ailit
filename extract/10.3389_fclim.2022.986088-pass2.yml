Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change and natural disasters (extreme temperatures and storms).
  8: The drivers of risk are climatic variables such as average temperature, average
    precipitation, drought, earthquake, landslide, storm, fire, extreme temperature,
    and flood.
  9: The paper analyzes the impact of climatic events on bilateral international migration,
    including temperature, precipitation, droughts, earthquakes, and other extreme
    events.
  10: Extreme poverty (lagged), average annual temperature (lagged), average annual
    precipitation (lagged), drought (lagged), earthquake (lagged), landslide (lagged),
    storm (lagged), fire (lagged), extreme temperature (lagged). Interaction terms
    between poverty and average temperature, drought and extreme temperature are also
    included.
  11: Average annual temperature, average annual precipitation, drought, earthquake,
    landslide, storm, fire, extreme temperature, and flood in the previous year (t-1)
  12: Conflict (t-1), Average temperature, annual (t-1), Average precipitation, annual
    (t-1), Drought (t-1), Earthquake (t-1), Landslide (t-1), Storm (t-1), Fire (t-1),
    Extreme temperature (t-1), Flood (t-1)
  14: Climatic variables (higher average temperatures, earthquakes), poverty, conflict
Highlights:
  1: Increasing extreme temperatures and storms in arid and semi-arid zones act as
    triggers of bilateral migration from South to North and that the estimated effects
    are non-negligible. The results are robust to a battery of tests, including dividing
    the sample according to the levels of conflict and poverty.
  8: The decision to migrate is motivated by past climate events, but not by distant
    ones, with the first lag of climatic variables being the most consistently significant.
    The effects of climate variables on migration differ depending on poverty levels
    and whether the country is arid or tropical.
  9: An increase in average temperatures is generally associated with a rise in out-migration
    for the total sample and most country income groups, but not for upper-middle-income
    countries.
  10: Higher average temperatures, even more-so when interacting with poverty, and
    extreme temperature are associated with increased out-migration. The results differ
    substantially across economic sub-samples. For example, the effect of drought
    is insignificant for the total sample, but positive and significant for LDCs.
    Extreme poverty is generally associated with lower out-migration across all subsamples.
  11: Droughts seem to have a systematic impact on emigration, reducing out-migration.
    Storms and fires tend to increase out-migration, particularly in arid and semi-arid
    regions. The effect of earthquakes is mixed, with some evidence suggesting they
    increase out-migration.
  12: Conflict and its interaction with various climate events (temperature, precipitation,
    drought, earthquake, landslide, storm, fire, extreme temperature, flood) significantly
    impact international migration per capita, with varying effects across different
    country income groups (Non-OECD, LDC, Lower-middle, Upper-middle).
  14: Higher average temperatures are related to a rise in out-migration in all country
    groups except for upper-middle income countries. Having earthquakes is linked
    to more out-migration in almost all country groups, except for the upper-middle
    income countries. Climatic events impact differently out-migration depending on
    the climatic zones to which countries belong. An increase in average temperatures
    is related to increased out-migration in the overall sample but to diminished
    emigration from tropical countries. An increase in average temperatures correlates
    with reduced emigration when controlling for poverty.
Methodology:
  1: A gravity model is estimated using panel data techniques, distinguishing by climatic
    zones, while also considering commonly used social and economic stresses. Analysis
    is based on bilateral emigration flows from 76 developing countries to OECD countries
    in the last decades.
  8: The estimation is conducted in a panel data framework with destination-year and
    dyadic fixed effects, and robust standard errors clustered at the origin-destination
    level. The analysis uses lags of climatic variables, with the first lag being
    most consistently significant. The methodology is based on a gravity model.
  9: Uses a gravity model of migration with PPML (Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood)
    estimation, including dyadic and destination-year fixed effects to analyze the
    relationship between climate events and migration.
  10: PPML (Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood) regression is used to estimate the
    impact of climatic events on out-migration, with bilateral migrant inflow per
    origin country population as the dependent variable. Dyadic and destination-year
    fixed effects are included. Standard errors are clustered at the origin-destination
    level. The time period of applicability is not explicitly stated, but based on
    the use of lagged variables, it can be inferred to be a panel data analysis over
    several years.
  11: 'PPML (Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood) estimation is used with dyadic and
    destination-year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the origin-destination
    level. Analysis is performed for different climatic zones: Arid, Semi-arid, All
    arid, Tropical wet, Tropical dry, All tropical. Negative values of average temperature
    are not considered.'
  12: The analysis uses a regression model to estimate the impact of climate events
    and conflict on bilateral international migration per capita. The results are
    applicable to understanding the relationship between these factors across different
    country income groups.
  14: Uses bilateral migration data to analyze the effect of climatic variables on
    international population displacements to OECD countries.
More Notes:
  1: The paper considers the interplay between climate change, conflict, and poverty
    as drivers of migration.
  8: The study does not deal with internal migration, and the destination-country
    fixed effects only absorb the effects of income and population variables in the
    destination country. Preliminary regressions including GDP per capita, population
    size, and population growth measures in the origin countries and the ratio of
    GDP per capita (between origin and destination) were insignificant.
  10: Negative values of average temperature are not considered. Some standard errors
    could not be computed for certain variables in certain sub-samples.
  11: Control variables such as demographic, welfare, and economic stability indicators
    were initially included but omitted due to insignificance. The joint significance
    of climatic variables and extreme weather events is tested.
  12: The table presents the coefficients for lagged climate variables (t-1) and their
