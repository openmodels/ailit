Drivers of Risk:
  2: Fluctuations in average monthly temperatures, daily temperature variability,
    and precipitation extremes impact inflation.
  3: Temperature shocks (one-off increase in monthly average temperature), excess
    wet conditions, excess dry conditions, daily precipitation extremes.
  4: Future warming due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.
  5: Increasing average temperatures due to climate change under different emission
    scenarios (SSP126 and SSP585).
  6: Increasing average temperatures, unpredictable hot extremes, summer heat extremes.
  7: Extreme heat events, future warming amplified by climate change (specifically
    temperature increases during the summer months of June, July, and August)
  8: Temperature shocks and climate change increasing temperature levels.
  9: Deviations of average temperature; deviations of temperature variability; exceedance
    of high precipitation thresholds; Standardised Precipitation Evapotranspiration
    Indices (SPEI) - both excess wet and excess dry conditions.
  10: Monthly weather shocks, deviations from normal seasonal conditions, average
    temperature, Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) > 0, SPEI
    < 0
  11: Projected future warming, specifically changes in monthly average temperatures,
    drives the risk to inflation.
Highlights:
  1: Extreme summer heat in 2022 increased food inflation in Europe by 0.43-0.93 percentage
    points, with warming projected for 2035 amplifying this by 30-50%.
  2: Temperature increases cause nonlinear, persistent increases in food and headline
    inflation, with stronger effects in hotter months and regions.
  3: Temperature shocks have persistent impacts on food and headline prices. Excess
    wet conditions cause upward impacts on food and headline prices which persist
    over twelve months, independent of baseline climate conditions. The effects of
    temperature increases appear consistent across both higher- and lower-income countries
    and when accounting for different historical inflation volatility, suggesting
    limited historical adaptation.
  4: Projected global warming would cause persistent upward exogenous pressures on
    inflation of considerable magnitudes already during the next few decades. The
    impacts are generally larger in the global south, with the largest pressures found
    across Africa and South America. Decisive mitigation of greenhouse gases could
    substantially reduce inflationary pressures.
  5: Projected temperature increases lead to pressure on both food and headline inflation;
    Inflation pressures are generally higher under the high-emission scenario (SSP585)
    compared to the low-emission scenario (SSP126); Seasonality of inflation pressures
    varies by latitude, with larger variations in Northern mid-latitudes; Heterogeneities
    in impacts arise from the dependence of the impacts on baseline temperatures.
  6: Future climate change will amplify the magnitude of heat extremes, thereby also
    amplifying their potential impact on inflation.
  7: Extreme heat already impacts inflation in Europe, and climate change will amplify
    these impacts, potentially by 30-50% by 2035, and up to nearly 200% by 2060 under
    pessimistic emissions scenarios. Impacts on food inflation, and also headline
    inflation, are observed.
  8: Climate change will alter inflation seasonality and increase inflation volatility
    and heterogeneity; traditional monetary policy models may become less effective.
  9: Impacts on food inflation from mean temperature are consistent when using World
    Bank data; the response of headline inflation differs considerably due to the
    inconsistent inclusion of imputed rents.
  10: The paper estimates the impacts of deviations from normal seasonal conditions,
    and the effects are additive.
  11: The paper evaluates how future weather conditions, particularly temperature
    changes, impact inflation. It assesses the inflationary impacts of the 2022 extreme
    summer heat in Europe and how these impacts could be amplified under future warming.
Methodology:
  2: Fixed-effects panel regression models are used to quantify the causal effects
    of historical weather conditions on national, month-on-month inflation rates across
    121 countries from 1996-2021, controlling for various confounders including country-specific
    time trends and seasonality.
  3: Fixed-effects panel regressions from over 27,000 observations of monthly price
    indices and weather fluctuations worldwide over the period 1996-2021. Robustness
    tests include using a dynamic panel specification, Driscoll-Kraay errors, and
    controls for monetary policy.
  4: Empirical models are used to assess the impacts of future temperature conditions
    on inflation, based on CMIP-6 climate model projections under different SSP scenarios.
    The analysis considers the effects of future weather conditions on inflation in
    the absence of unprecedented adaptation, a targeted monetary policy response,
    or interactions with macroeconomic developments.
  5: Empirical specification using monthly CPI data and CMIP-6 climate model projections
    to estimate the impact of increasing average temperatures on inflation; Impacts
    are estimated accounting only for increasing average temperatures using the baseline
    empirical specification shown in column 1 of Supplementary Tables S4 & S5; The
    analysis abstracts from unprecedented adaptation, policy response, and interactions
    with macroeconomic developments.
  6: Empirical response functions using monthly temperatures and consumer price index
    (CPI) data from 1996-2021; CMIP-6 climate model projections for future warming
    scenarios (SSP585 for the maps).
  7: Empirical analysis using historical data of temperatures and inflation. Future
    climate change impacts are projected using CMIP-6 climate models under different
    SSP emission scenarios, and population weighting is used for regional aggregation.
  8: Empirical models using granular monthly climate data to estimate inflation impacts;
    assessment based on causal relationships inferred from these models applied to
    national data.
  9: Fixed-effects panel regression models to identify the causal effects of changes
    in weather variables on national level inflation; spatial aggregation using population-weighted
    average; interaction terms to capture heterogeneities in the response to temperature
    shocks.
  10: The study uses a regression model with country, date, and country-month fixed
    effects, as well as country-specific linear time trends, and lags of weather variables
    to estimate the impact of climate variables on inflation. The analysis is performed
    on a global panel of countries. Climate model data for temperature and precipitation
    are used from CMIP-6 under SSP585 and SSP126 scenarios from 2015-2100.
  11: The study evaluates the hypothetical impact on inflation that future weather
    conditions under projected climate change would cause, given their empirical models.
    They use CMIP-6 climate models and two emission scenarios (SSP585 and the NGFS
    hot-house world scenario). The data is bias-adjusted and statistically downscaled
    to a common half-degree grid. Impacts are averaged over 30-year periods. The approach
    shifts the mean of the distribution of possible summer temperatures. Uncertainty
    is assessed across empirical specifications, climate model projections, and emission
    scenarios.
More Notes:
  2: The study finds limited evidence for impacts on other price sub-components aside
    from weak evidence in the electricity sector.
  3: The study tests whether adaptation can be seen in the historical period by defining
    temperature shocks with respect to a moving average over the past 30 years, finding
    very similar response functions. Information Criteria do not provide strong evidence
    for using shocks defined in either way. Results are qualitatively consistent under
    different SPEI timescales and thresholds. Statistically significant upwards pressures
    on headline inflation can be identified in hot months in the first month following
    a precipitation shock.
  4: The paper acknowledges that adaptation could mitigate impacts from future climate
    change, and explores the potential of adaptation via adjustment to changing temperatures
    to reduce future impacts.
  5: The study focuses on exogenous pressures on inflation arising from future weather
    conditions, without considering adaptation, policy responses, or macroeconomic
    interactions; Data on national administrative boundaries are obtained from the
    GADM database version 3.6 (https://gadm.org /).
  6: The estimates reflect the exogenous pressure on inflation arising from future
    weather conditions in the absence of historically unprecedented adaptation or
    policy response. The study considers only the impact of temperature on food inflation,
    holding other factors constant (ceteris paribus).
  7: The study identifies weather variables with significant historical impacts on
    headline and food inflation globally, but acknowledges limitations in providing
    a comprehensive relationship between weather conditions and inflation, such as
    the spatial variability of precipitation, which makes its relationship to inflation
    difficult to observe at the national level.
  8: Emphasizes importance of unprecedented adaptation and technological changes to
    limit inflation pressures; adaptation not explicitly modeled.
  9: The study focuses on the impact of deviations from historical seasonal patterns,
    assuming economies are adapted to historical weather; daily precipitation extremes
    are included with an interaction with the monthly average temperature level; the
    interaction with the average temperature level introduces a heterogeneity in the
    response to temperature shocks across both geographical locations and seasons.
  10: The paper includes robustness tests using dynamic models with lagged inflation,
    Driscoll-Kraay errors, an inflation database from the World Bank, and controls
    for transitions in monetary policy. The effects of interactions between climate
    variables and country income level are also investigated.
  11: The study distinguishes between projections of future inflation and an evaluation
    of the mechanism via which climate conditions affect inflation. The empirical
    results are robust to changes in the regime of monetary policy. The analysis uses
    population-weighted averages to reflect human exposure to future inflationary
    pressures.
