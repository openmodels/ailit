Drivers of Risk:
  1: Higher temperatures, daily temperature variability, and extreme precipitation.
  2: Impacts arise from fluctuations in average monthly temperatures and temperature
    variability as well as precipitation extremes.
  3: Temperature shocks, excess wet conditions, excess dry conditions, and daily precipitation
    extremes are considered as drivers of risk.
  4: Future warming, intensification of weather extremes, and variability due to anthropogenic
    greenhouse gas emissions are main drivers impacting inflation.
  5: Increasing average temperatures projected under future climate change (specifically,
    CMIP-6 climate model projections under SSP126 and SSP585).
  6: Average temperature conditions, future summer warming, heat extremes.
  7: Extreme summer heat and future warming, as projected by CMIP-6 climate models
    under different SSP emission scenarios, are the drivers of risk.
  8: The main drivers of risk are higher-than-normal temperatures, especially in hot
    months and countries; future climate change impacts (warming levels); and short-term
    rises in inflation from exceptionally hot periods.
  10: Weather variables (temperature, precipitation, SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration
    Index)), including lagged effects of monthly weather shocks.
  11: Future weather conditions under projected climate change, specifically monthly
    average national temperatures

  11: Inflation
Highlights:
  1: Higher temperatures increase food and headline inflation persistently over 12
    months. Effects vary across seasons and regions. Pressures are largest at low
    latitudes and show strong seasonality at high latitudes, peaking in summer.
  2: Temperature increases lead to nonlinear, persistent increases in food and headline
    inflation; impacts vary with baseline temperatures and persist for 12 months.
  3: Temperature increases cause equivalent impacts on inflation in high- and low-income
    countries, suggesting limited historical adaptation. Strongest and most significant
    historical weather impacts on inflation come from changes in average temperature.
  4: Projected global warming will cause persistent upward pressures on inflation,
    with stronger impacts in the Global South, especially Africa and South America.
    Advanced economies will also experience significant impacts on food inflation.
  5: 'Seasonality of pressures on food inflation vary by latitude: fairly constant
    across seasons at low latitudes but vary considerably across seasons in Northern
    mid-latitudes (20-40N), where they can be more than twice as large in summer compared
    to winter. At the highest latitudes (>40N) upwards pressure in summer contrasts
    downwards pressure in winter. These seasonal heterogeneities are robust across
    empirical specifications. Seasonally heterogenous pressures would cause alterations
    to the usual seasonal cycle of food inflation.'
  6: Future climate change is projected to amplify heat extremes and their potential
    impact on food inflation. In some regions, warming can amplify seasonal variability;
    in others (including much of Europe), it can reduce seasonal variability.
  7: Extreme heat events significantly impact inflation, particularly food inflation,
    and these impacts are expected to be amplified by future climate change. The amplification
    of extreme heat impacts on inflation in Europe is projected to be 30-50% due to
    climate change by 2035.
  8: Climate change is likely to alter inflation seasonality, increase inflation volatility
    and heterogeneity, and place persistent pressures on inflation levels. Temperature
    shocks under future climate change would amplify inflation heterogeneity and alter
    the seasonality of inflation within individual countries. There are persistent
    upward pressures on annual food inflation.
  10: Accounting for linear time trends enhances the magnitude of estimated effects.
    The study calculates and plots cumulative marginal effects of climate variables
    on inflation.
  11: The study evaluates how extreme summer heat events could amplify under future
    warming, focusing on the 2022 European summer as a case study. It assesses the
    impacts of the 2022 extreme summer heat in Europe using ERA-5 estimates of monthly
    temperatures.
Methodology:
  1: Fixed-effects regressions applied to over 27,000 observations of monthly consumer
    price indices worldwide. Projections are for 2035 under different emission scenarios,
    climate models, and empirical specifications.
  2: The analysis uses fixed-effects panel regression models to quantify the effects
    of weather fluctuations on inflation, utilizing high-resolution data from the
    ERA5.
  3: Fixed-effects panel regressions from over 27,000 observations of monthly price
    indices and weather fluctuations worldwide over the period 1996-2021 were performed.
    Robustness tests include using a dynamic panel specification, Driscoll-Kraay errors,
    and controls for monetary policy.
  4: The analysis uses empirical models derived from historical data on weather impacts
    on inflation, combined with future climate projections from 21 bias-adjusted climate
    models in the CMIP-6 under different emission scenarios.
  5: Empirical specification using monthly CPI data and CMIP-6 climate model projections.
    Estimates reflect exogenous pressure on inflation from future weather, *abstracting
    from adaptation, policy response, and macroeconomic interactions.* Only increasing
    average temperatures are considered. Baseline empirical specification shown in
    Supplementary Tables S4 & S5 (column 1).
  6: Uses CMIP-6 climate model projections to estimate future temperature conditions
    under a high-emission scenario (SSP5-8.5), and applies empirical response functions
    to historical temperatures and projected warming to assess impacts on food inflation.
    The analysis considers the shifting mean of summer temperatures to evaluate the
    impact of amplified heat extremes.
  7: Empirical analysis using historical data and climate model projections (CMIP-6)
    under various SSPs, with impacts regionally aggregated using population weighting.
    Analysis applies to Europe, Northern Europe, and Southern Europe.
  8: The study uses monthly, non-seasonally adjusted price data from 121 countries
    from 1996-2021. Month-on-month inflation rates are used as the main dependent
    variable, estimated as the first difference in the logarithm of consumer price
    indices (CPI).
  10: Uses a regression model with country, date, and country-month fixed effects,
    as well as country-specific linear time trends. Includes lags of weather variables
    to assess delayed effects. Robustness tests include dynamic models with lagged
    inflation rates, Driscoll Kraay errors, controls for monetary policy transitions,
    and interactions with national income.
  11: Uses empirical models to evaluate the impact of future weather on inflation,
    bias-adjusted and statistically downscaled climate data from CMIP-6 models, and
    assesses impacts using projected monthly average national temperatures. It evaluates
    first terms pertaining to monthly average temperatures of Eq. 3 under future temperature
    conditions. This approach assumes that future warming will shift the mean of the
    distribution of possible summer temperatures.
More Notes:
  3: The study considers both static (1990-2021 average) and moving average baselines
    for temperature shocks, finding similar results. It also tests the impacts of
    daily precipitation extremes.
  4: The study assumes no unprecedented adaptation or targeted monetary policy response
    to the future climate impacts on inflation.
  5: The study acknowledges that the estimates reflect exogenous pressure on inflation
    *in the absence of* adaptation, policy response, and macroeconomic developments,
    suggesting these factors are not accounted for. The analysis is based on the GADM
    database for national administrative boundaries.
  6: The analysis focuses on exogenous pressures on inflation arising from future
    weather conditions, without considering adaptation or policy responses. Country-specific
    examples (USA, Germany, Colombia, Kenya) are presented.
  8: The paper acknowledges that adaptation to climate change offers an opportunity
    to limit pressures on inflation but that pressures on inflation would remain persistent
    and sizable even when accounting for such adaptation. The paper also suggests
    that the identification of the drivers of inflation may become more difficult
    when relying on traditionally used models. The paper notes that monetary policy
    may need to consider weather and climate shocks, as these shocks can no longer
    be considered temporary.
  10: The study acknowledges data limitations, especially regarding monthly resolution
    data for employment and economic output for all countries. The study uses data
    from 21 climate models participating in CMIP-6 under SSP585 and SSP126 scenarios
    for future climate data.
  11: The analysis explicitly states that the results are not projections of future
    inflation, but evaluations of how climate conditions affect inflation via a particular
    mechanism. It presents country-level impacts aggregated to larger spatial regions
    using population-weighted averages to reflect human exposure to future inflationary
    pressures. The uncertainty in estimated impacts arises from choice of empirical
    specification, climate model projections, and future emission scenarios.

Quantitative material:
  1: Projects upwards pressures on food inflation of 0.92-3.23 percentage-points per-year
    and headline inflation of 0.32-1.18 percentage-points per-year on average globally
    for 2035. The 2022 extreme summer heat increased food inflation in Europe by 0.43-0.93
    percentage-points which warming projected for 2035 would amplify by 30-50%.
  2: "A 1\xB0C increase in monthly temperature can cause a cumulative effect on food\
    \ inflation of 0.17 percentage points over the following year."
  3: "A one-off 1\xB0C increase in monthly temperature has a persistent impact on\
    \ food and headline prices. The graphs show the cumulative marginal effects of\
    \ a one-off 1\xB0C increase in monthly temperature on month-on-month inflation\
    \ rates, evaluated at different baseline temperatures."
  4: Projected food inflation impacts are quantified between 0.92-3.23 percentage
    points per year by 2035 globally, and headline inflation impacts range from 0.32-1.18
    percentage points per year.
  5: Maps of pressure on annual national inflation in food and headline price aggregates
    for 2035 under SSP585; Annual pressure on inflation aggregated across world regions
    (population weighted) at different time periods (2025, 2035) under SSP126 and
    SSP585 for food and headline price aggregates (point estimates and standard deviation).
  6: Estimates the effects of 2022 European summer heat on food inflation (0.67 percentage
    points impact in Europe) and headline inflation (0.34 percentage points impact
    in Europe), and projects percentage change in seasonal variability of food inflation
    under future temperature conditions.
  7: The 2022 summer heat extreme caused an estimated 1.0 percentage point (0.6-1.6)
    increase in food inflation in Europe. This impact is projected to increase to
    1.1 (0.6-1.8) percentage points under a low-emission scenario by 2060 and 1.8
    (1.0-3.2) percentage points under a high-emission scenario by 2060.
  8: "A 1.5\xB0C quarterly summer temperature increase leads to a 0.38%-points impact\
    \ on food inflation. A 1.5\xB0C temperature increase at the baseline temperature\
    \ (23.5\xB0C) indicates an impact of 0.17%-points. When this temperature shock\
    \ persists across all three months of a quarter, the impact is 0.49%-points. The\
    \ authors find that temperatures projected for 2035 could cause upward pressures\
    \ on annual food inflation of 1-3 percentage points per year."
  10: The study presents cumulative marginal effects, reflecting the theoretical cumulative
    impact on prices from a 1-unit climate shock, estimated by summing the lagged
    coefficients.
  11: "Evaluates the hypothetical impact on inflation caused by future weather conditions,\
    \ quantifying it under different climate scenarios. Mentions temperature changes\
    \ of 1.7\xB0C (SSP585) and 3.2\xB0C (NGFS)."
