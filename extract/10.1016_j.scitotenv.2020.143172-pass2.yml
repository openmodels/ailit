Drivers of Risk:
  5: Climate change impacts on land use, environmental policy, food security, demographic
    change, societal attitudes, technological change (digital technology and innovation),
    governance structures, and international relations (globalisation vs nationalism)
    are identified as drivers of risk.
  6: Transition to green energy, strategic land-use planning, and size and integration
    of the working population are considered influential drivers.
  8: Changes in agriculture (intensive vs. extensive), energy mix (gas/oil), trade
    barriers, technological innovation (water-efficient crops), population growth,
    GDP growth, and regulations all impact water abstraction.
Highlights:
  5: The UK-SSPs development focused on narratives, tables of driver uncertainties,
    and tables with semi-quantitative trends developed by stakeholders. The uncertainties
    associated with driver categories focus on describing the type or dynamics of
    transitions, rather than velocity of change.
  6: Rapid transition to green energy is expected in UK-SSP1 and UK-SSP4, while a
    gradual transition is expected in UK-SSP2 and UK-SSP5 due to existing infrastructure
    barriers.
  8: The participatory process resulted in consistent yet relevant scenarios for the
    UK, linking local, regional, and global drivers.
Methodology:
  5: The analysis uses a 'Story and Simulation' approach involving iterating qualitative
    participatory scenarios with quantitative modeled scenarios. Stakeholder workshops
    were conducted to identify key UK drivers of change and their uncertainties. Stakeholders
    categorized scenario trends for variables in three time slices and provided confidence
    numbers for these trends.
  6: Stakeholder consultations were used to identify drivers and their uncertainty
    polarities, mapping them to the UK-SSP in sessions.
  8: The paper uses a combination of bottom-up (participatory) and top-down (global
    SSPs) approaches to develop UK-specific Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. These scenarios
    extend to the 2070s.
More Notes:
  6: Focus on UK-specific drivers within the context of SSPs and their impact on future
    national development.
  8: The paper focuses on narratives and qualitative descriptions of potential future
    scenarios, particularly regarding water abstraction under different SSPs. The
    images attached present narratives of scenarios relating to challenges in mitigation
    and adaptation.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  5: The paper identifies several driver categories that could influence the agricultural
    sector and potential knock-on effects for biodiversity, which could have macroeconomic
    implications. It also identifies that the nature of the economy, particularly
    how environmental change will be coupled to the future economic system, and how
    this might shape the UK economy in relation to the rest of the world, is an important
    uncertainty.
  6: No relevant information
  8: Trends in water abstraction are affected by behavioural changes (demand-driven)
    and technology-driven efficiencies in water saving (supply-driven).
Quantitative material:
  5: The paper mentions the development of semi-quantitative trends for eight variables
    (change in arable land, fertiliser use, water abstraction, protected areas, human,
    social, manufactured, financial and natural capitals) across three time slices
    (present to 2040, 2040 to 2070, and 2070 to 2100) with confidence scores.
