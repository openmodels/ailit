Highlights:
  3: Efforts to mitigate climate change can reduce climate impacts on tree diversity,
    which can safeguard the ability of forests to store carbon.
  4: Climate change mitigation can reduce the loss of tree diversity and biodiversity-dependent
    productivity. The effects are more substantial in colder and drier biomes. Mitigation
    efforts conserve tree diversity and primary productivity, contributing to carbon
    storage.
  5: Countries with a high country-level social cost of carbon also tend to be the
    countries where climate change mitigation could greatly help maintain primary
    productivity by safeguarding tree diversity; The US and China are estimated to
    experience some of the biggest economic damages due to anthropogenic global warming;
    Brazil has the largest potential to benefit in multiple ways from climate mitigation
    efforts.
  6: A dual focus on both the quantity (area) and the quality (biodiversity) of forest
    ecosystems could help support climate stabilization. Biologically diverse forests
    have great value.
  7: Protection and restoration of biologically diverse forests can substantially
    contribute to climate change mitigation.
  16: The map visually represents the comparative effectiveness of climate mitigation
    strategies under different socio-economic pathways across global regions, showing
    the impact on tree diversity-dependent productivity. Effectiveness varies significantly
    by region and SSP.
  22: Quantifies the effect sizes of mitigation efforts on conservation of species
    and productivity, focusing on the relationship between the country-level social
    cost of carbon and the country-level reduction in forest productivity loss.
  32: The impact of climate mitigation policy on reducing productivity loss varies
    across biomes. Land use changes differ significantly under different SSPs, influencing
    the impact on ecosystems.
  37: The social cost of carbon is calculated at a country level.
  40: The analysis focuses on mitigation and high-emission baseline scenarios, considering
    climate change impacts on land use.
  46: Analyzes the relationship between the country-level social cost of carbon and
    the country-level reduction in forest productivity loss under different SSPs.
  47: Global productivity conservation was estimated based on the difference in productivity
    loss between baseline and mitigation scenarios. Similar productivity conservation
    values can arise from different underlying assumptions about land use (e.g., deforestation
    vs. reforestation).
  48: The study aims to map potential suitable habitat for woody vascular plant species
    globally using climate and land-use data.

  60: Climate mitigation efforts can alleviate the impacts of climate change on tree
    species and associated productivity in forested biomes; the effectiveness of mitigation
    can be quantified.
  63: "Maps show the effects of climate change mitigation to alleviate the loss of\
    \ tree diversity-dependent productivity (\u0394P)."
Methodology:
  2: The study quantifies how tree and shrub species richness affect biomass production
    at biome, national, and regional scales. The results apply to the next 50 years.
  3: "Ecological modeling to estimate local-scale species richness changes; Combined\
    \ with local-scale estimates of proportional changes in primary productivity in\
    \ response to richness changes; multiplied by net primary productivity (NPP);\
    \ aggregated these changes in local productivity to produce large-scale estimates\
    \ of changes in productivity at biome, national, and regional scales; Five shared\
    \ socioeconomic pathways (SSPs); Compared high-emission baseline vs mitigation\
    \ scenario; Three General Circulation Models (GCMs) to consider two different\
    \ representative concentration pathways (RCPs) in each of the five SSPs. Mitigation\
    \ scenario assumes levels of greenhouse gas emissions will stabilize the global\
    \ mean temperature rise relative to preindustrial times to less than 2 \xB0C by\
    \ the end of the 21st century."
  4: Quantified the effects of climate change mitigation on species loss and productivity
    loss at the local scale as log ratios. Analysis conducted at the IPBES subregional
    scale.
  5: Aggregated regional heterogeneity into country-level estimates; Compared estimates
    of productivity loss reductions with country-level social cost of carbon.
  7: The study assesses the relationship between tree diversity, biodiversity, primary
    productivity, and climate change mitigation.
  16: "The effect sizes of \u0394P were calculated at the local scale (30 arcseconds\
    \ cells) for 17 subregions based on IPBES7. Ensembled results across three GCMs\
    \ are shown for five SSPs from 2005 to 2070s. Results for each GCM are shown in\
    \ Extended Data Figure 7."
  22: "The reductions in local-scale loss of species (\u0394SR) and productivity (\u0394\
    P) are calculated as a log ratio scale. Mixed-effects meta-regression is used\
    \ for biome-level analyses with climate conditions as a moderator. Correlation\
    \ analysis between country-level social cost of carbon and country-level reduction\
    \ in forest productivity loss."
  23: Used a generalized additive model (GAM) with the CSCC as an explanatory variable
    for individual combinations of SSPs and GCMs. Used a generalized additive mixed
    model (GAMM) with the GCMs as a random effect and the CSCC as an explanatory variable
    to ensemble results across the GCMs. Checked if the results were affected by land
    area, using the GAMMs. Summed up the reduction in productivity loss across all
    countries, under each of SSPs and GCMs.
  32: The analysis uses Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and General Circulation
    Models (GCMs) to estimate productivity loss. Land use changes are visualized across
    different SSPs. A model scenario labeled 'HadGEM2-ES' is used to analyze biomes
    under different conditions. Different models (MIROC5 and MCHEM) are used to estimate
    reduction in productivity loss.
  37: The paper quantifies the social cost of carbon at a country level. Details are
    in Nat Clim Change 8, 895-900, doi:10.1038/s41558-018-0282-y (2018).
  40: Uses future climatic variables based on General Circulation Models (GCMs) included
    in the Fifth Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Project (CMIP5) experiment (MIROC-ESM-CHEM,
    HadGEM2-ES, and GFDL-CM3) and future land-use variables based on the Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSPs) framework (SSP1, SSP2, SSP3, SSP4, SSP5). Land-use changes are
    determined using the AIM/CGE, a computable general equilibrium model representing
    the entire global economy and the AIM/PLUM downscaling model.
  46: Uses estimates from baseline and mitigation scenarios to calculate reductions
    in local-scale loss of species and productivity as a log ratio scale. Meta-analytical
    approach and mixed-effects meta-regression used to ensemble results across GCMs
    and biomes. Generalized additive model (GAM) and generalized additive mixed model
    (GAMM) are used to model the relationship between country-level social cost of
    carbon and country-level reduction in forest productivity loss.
  47: Generalized Additive Models (GAMMs) were used. The study sums up the reduction
    in productivity loss across all countries under each SSP and GCM by comparing
    baseline and mitigation scenarios.
  48: Species distribution modeling using MaxEnt algorithm to predict suitable habitat
    based on climate and land-use predictors, optimized using AICc and regularization
    parameter tuning. The model uses occurrence data up to 2015, climate data from
    1960-1990, and land use data from 2005, and is applicable at a global scale with
    two spatial resolutions (coarse and fine).
  52: The continuous Boyce index (CBI) calculated on 10-fold cross-validation is used
    to evaluate model quality.
  58: The workflow estimates changes in species richness and productivity by the 2070s.
  60: Comparison of mitigation scenario with baseline scenario to determine effectiveness
    of mitigation efforts.
  63: Calculations are performed across three General Circulation Models (GCMs). Results
    are shown for the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Results are shown
    from 2005 to 2070s.
More Notes:
  2: The paper highlights the need to consider biodiversity as a key component of
    nature-based solutions for climate change, emphasizing that it is not just a target
    for conservation but also a contributor to climate stabilization. The paper suggests
    that reforestation programs should focus on the co-benefits for climate, biodiversity,
    and society, but does not detail how to do so.
  3: The analysis focuses on tree and shrub species in different biomes, extending
    to woody species in all terrestrial biomes. Regional scale analysis focuses on
    subregion categories of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity
    and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).
  4: The effectiveness of mitigation efforts is spatially heterogeneous. Stringent
    mitigation may require substantial land-use changes, which could harm biodiversity.
    Responses of tree diversity and productivity to climate change vary by region.
  5: Reforestation programs and policies often focus on monocultures which is not
    the optimal approach.
  6: The paper highlights the importance of tree diversity in forests for carbon sequestration
    and ecosystem services, arguing that monoculture plantations are less beneficial
    than diverse natural forests. The projections made contain several sources of
    uncertainty, related to the representation of tree species and future climate
    conditions.
  7: The study did not fully account for management and opportunity costs, nor did
    it separate the individual influences of different climate mitigation practices.
    The study acknowledges that the ability of forests to increase carbon uptake in
    the short term cannot be linearly translated into a long-term ability to halt
    climate warming. Responses at the biome level were not necessarily consistent
    across socioeconomic pathways.
  32: The paper uses various models and scenarios to project the impact of climate
    change and mitigation policies on land use, biomes, and productivity. The bar
    charts provide a visual comparison of different scenarios and their impact on
    various ecosystems.
  40: The paper uses a classification scheme of the International Geosphere-Biosphere
    Programme (IGBP) to categorize land use. The target years are the 2070s.
  47: Results are affected by land area. Caution is necessary when interpreting the
    results due to contrasting assumptions across SSPs (e.g., regarding deforestation
    and reforestation).
  48: The focus is on ecological modeling of species distribution rather than direct
    macroeconomic or fiscal impacts of climate change or adaptation.
  52: The study focuses on species habitat suitability, using climatic and land-use
    variables as predictors. This page does not explicitly address macroeconomic or
    macro-fiscal outcomes.
  56: The scenario assumes successful management of local environmental problems like
    air pollution and faith in the ability to effectively manage social and ecological
    systems, including geo-engineering if necessary. This management might have cost
    implications not detailed here.
  58: This page provides a high-level overview of the workflow and does not include
    specific details on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, or the costs and benefits
    of adaptation. The workflow seems focused on ecological outcomes (species richness
    and productivity).
  63: The maps use different color schemes (blue and red) to represent different effect
    sizes, potentially showing positive and negative impacts of mitigation efforts
    on productivity.
