Highlights:
  2: Greenhouse gas mitigation could help maintain tree diversity and avoid a 9-39%
    reduction in terrestrial primary productivity; Countries that will incur the greatest
    economic damages from climate change stand to benefit the most from conservation
    of tree diversity; There is an opportunity for a triple win for climate, biodiversity
    and society
  4: Climate change mitigation can substantially reduce tree diversity loss and associated
    productivity loss, especially in colder and drier biomes; warmer biomes such as
    tropical and subtropical forests have high absolute productivity and extent and
    therefore contribute considerably to global productivity loss when diversity is
    lost; mitigation efforts are spatially heterogeneous in their effectiveness.
  5: Biodiversity conservation offers a substantial contribution to climate crisis
    solutions by conserving productivity.
  6: Diverse forests are better for climate stabilization than monoculture forests.
    A dual focus on both the quantity (area) and the quality (biodiversity) of forest
    ecosystems could help support climate stabilization. Rare species can have disproportionately
    large contributions to ecosystem functioning.
  7: Protection and restoration of biologically diverse forests can make a substantial
    contribution to climate change mitigation; Tree diversity is an important piece
    of the nature-based climate solution puzzle; Biodiversity-dependent climate change
    mitigation is important for ecosystem-based adaptation.

    biomes and SSPs.
  14: Climate change mitigation can lead to an 8.8-38.9% reduction in productivity
    loss in tree biomes compared to a baseline scenario across the five SSPs. The

    precipitation.

    by implementing additional climate mitigation policies compared to a business-as-usual
    scenario across various biomes, SSPs and GCMs.

    policy, respectively, shown across different regions and SSPs.

More Notes:
  1: This page is primarily an introduction and author affiliation list. The title
    suggests the paper will explore the relationship between biodiversity and productivity
    in the context of nature-based climate solutions, but this page itself doesn't
    provide any results or analysis.
  2: The paper emphasizes the need for nature-based solutions and highlights that
    biodiversity is not yet widely appreciated as a powerful contributor to climate
    stabilization.
  4: The strength of the diversity-productivity relationship could be altered by warming,
    potentially offsetting negative impacts of species decline. Responses can vary
    by region.
  6: The authors acknowledge that their estimates of biodiversity-dependent productivity
    are likely conservative, a lower bound estimate. New combinations of species are
    likely to emerge under a changing climate, which may alter interactions between
    species.
  7: Novel combinations of species will likely emerge in the future, resulting from
    idiosyncratic events and human influences; Responses at the biome level were not
    necessarily consistent across socioeconomic pathways; Mitigation goals achieved
    by afforestation in formerly non-forested lands could have unintended negative
    impacts on biodiversity and productivity of these ecosystems; The ability of forests
    to increase carbon uptake in the short-term cannot be linearly translated into
    the ability of forests to halt climate warming over a longer time horizon.
  8: The text suggests a stabilizing feedback loop between climate change mitigation
    and biodiversity conservation and that addressing one environmental problem may
    help address the other.
  12: Illustrates feedback loops between biodiversity, carbon, and climate; emphasizes
    benefits of stabilizing biodiversity.
  14: The analysis uses five SSPs (Sustainability, Middle-of-the-road, Regional rivalry,
    Inequality, and Fossil-fueled development) to project future climate scenarios.
    Extended Data figures contain additional information on individual GCM results
    and coarse grid scale maps.
  16: The study uses the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity
    and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) subregions. Extended Data Figure 7 contains results
    for each GCM individually.

  32: The study considers the role of biodiversity in reducing productivity loss,
    with results shown for a specific model (MIROC-ESM-CHEM) and likely others.
  35: The size of the circles in the scatter plot is proportional to the forested
    area of each country. Colors correspond to the country-level sum of productivity
    conservation.
  36: The page contains world maps that compare total species and analyzed species
    data globally, specifically highlighting Brazil for total species and European
    countries for analysis proportion.
  41: Mitigation scenarios were based on SSPs combined with RCPs, with some combinations
    deemed incompatible. Bioenergy crops and afforestation were merged into cropland
    and forests, respectively, due to data limitations.
  44: The analysis relies on coarse grids (n=32,677) and fine grids. It appears to
    be simulating meta-community dynamics.
  45: The proportional changes in forest productivity estimated based on tree volume
    increment may not fully capture total terrestrial vegetation NPP, although a substantial
    fraction of forest primary productivity is derived from tree growth.
  47: Caution is necessary when interpreting results because similar productivity
    conservation values can result from contrasting underlying assumptions about deforestation/reforestation.
  48: The study assumes species are at equilibrium with their environment and that
    relevant ecological drivers are included.
  49: The study uses species distribution models to understand how tree and shrub
    species distributions relate to climate, though this is not explicitly stated
    on the page. The page focuses on methods rather than results.
  50: The paper uses both fine-scale and coarse-scale data for both climate and land-use
    variables.
  51: 'SSPs used: SSP1 (sustainability), SSP3 (regional rivalry), SSP5 (fossil-fuelled
    development), SSP4 (inequality), SSP2 (middle-of-the-road).'
  52: Temporal extent is 2050s (average of 2041-2060) and 2070s (average of 2061-2080)
  56: The page describes a specific scenario, SSP5, which is characterized by high
    fossil fuel use, rapid economic growth, and faith in technological solutions to
    environmental problems, including geo-engineering.
  61: The analysis is conducted at a fine grid-scale and then aggregated to coarse
    grids, with results presented for five SSPs.
  62: The maps likely illustrate projections, models, or observed changes, such as
    climate impacts, population density changes, or land use alterations. The results
    of individual GCMs are shown in Extended Data Figure 2.
