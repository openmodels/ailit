Drivers of Risk:
  2: "Damaging climate shocks, 2008-2009 drought, 2015-2016 El Ni\xF1o event (floods),\
    \ Inter-annual variability, increase frequency and intensity of extreme weather\
    \ phenomena including rainstorms and drought."
Highlights:
  2: Uruguay's National Agricultural Information System (SNIA) is a national-level
    climate service investment to address near-term climate risk management.
  6: Key individuals and relationships of trust played a role in conceiving and shaping
    the SNIA, an agricultural climate service. Support for sustainable agricultural
    intensification helped create the context for investment in the SNIA.
Methodology:
  2: Semi-structured interviews were used to identify several factors that contributed
    to the decision to invest in and develop a national-level climate service for
    the agricultural sector in Uruguay.
  6: Qualitative analysis of key individuals and innovation systems in Uruguay to
    understand the development of the SNIA (National Agricultural Information System).
More Notes:
  6: The analysis suggests that investments in climate service progress in a relatively
    ordered manner, beginning with recognition, proceeding to groundwork, and moving
    on to more high-level investments.
