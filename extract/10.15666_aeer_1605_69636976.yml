Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change affecting agriculture, leading to food deficiency; CO2 concentration
    as a driver of climate change.
  4: Climate change, greenhouse gas emissions (CO2), population, agricultural added
    value, agricultural land.
  5: CO2 release, urbanization, housing development on agricultural land
  9: Changes in the share of agricultural fields within total area, agricultural added
    value, GDP per capita, and population.
  10: A 1% increase in population results in a 1.98% increase in the CO2 level in
    Turkey.
  11: "Share of agricultural fields within total area (\u03C7) and population (\u03B4\
    ) are considered as drivers of CO2 emissions (Y) and GDP per capita (\u03BB)."
  12: Population increase and agricultural land share are identified as drivers of
    CO2 levels.
Highlights:
  1: Population has a greater effect on CO2 release than other variables in both Eurasia
    and Turkey; all variables under study had an increasing effect on CO2 release
    in the long term in the Eurasian Region, while the share of agricultural areas
    within total area and the GDP variables had an effect to reduce CO2 release.
  4: Agricultural added value, population, and GDP have movements in the same direction
    in Eurasian countries. CO2 emissions and population exhibit a correlated trend.
    CO2 emissions and GDP per capita show some correlation.
  5: CO2 release in Turkey and agricultural area, agricultural added value, population
    and GDP develop in the same trend. The increase in CO2 release continues even
    if the share of the agricultural fields has a decreasing trend after 2005.
  9: In the Eurasian countries, all variables were statistically significant in influencing
    CO2 emissions in the long run. In Turkey, the share of agricultural fields per
    total area and population significantly impact CO2 emissions.
  10: The share of agricultural fields within the total area decreases CO2 by 1.83%
    with a 1% increase.
  11: For Eurasia, there is short-run causality from agricultural fields to population
    and from agricultural added value to GDP per capita. In Turkey, there is short-run
    causality from CO2 levels to population, from agricultural fields to GDP per capita,
    from agricultural added value to population, from population to CO2, agricultural
    fields, and agricultural added value, and from GDP per capita to population. The
    CO2 level in Turkey will be balanced every 9 months if the conditions are maintained
    this way.
  12: Population is considered the most effective variable affecting CO2 levels. The
    relationship between agricultural fields and CO2 release differs between the Eurasian
    region (linear and positive) and Turkey (negative). GDP's relationship with environmental
    destruction varies based on the country's development level.
Methodology:
  1: Econometric models like ADF unit square test, ARDL and VECM were used to examine
    the effects of the share of agricultural fields, agricultural added value, GDP,
    and population on CO2 release in Eurasia and Turkey.
  4: The paper examines the development trend of Eurasian countries and Turkey between
    1993 and 2016 with respect to agricultural added value, agricultural land, population,
    GDP, and CO2. It uses line graphs to visualize the trends and correlations between
    CO2 emissions, population, and GDP per capita.
  5: Investigates factors affecting CO2 release in Eurasian countries and Turkey using
    data from 1993 to 2016. Factors include agricultural land share, agricultural
    added value, GDP, and population.
  7: The analysis uses autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and vector error correction
    model (VECM) to test for co-integration without considering integration levels
    of variables.
  9: Unit root tests and ARDL analysis applied to assess long-run relationships between
    variables; results are applicable to the Eurasian countries and Turkey provided
    in the study.
  10: Analysis is performed using the Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) for determining
    short and long-term causalities among variables affecting the CO2 level.
  11: The study uses Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to analyze the short-run
    and long-run causality between CO2 emissions, agricultural fields, agricultural
    added value, GDP per capita, and population for Eurasia and Turkey, applicable
    to the period of data analyzed.
  12: VECM (Vector Error Correction Model) analysis was used to assess the relationship
    between agriculture, GDP, population, and climate change in Eurasian countries
    and Turkey. The results are applicable between 1993 and 2006.
More Notes:
  1: The study suggests the importance of awareness of environmental costs and the
    need for environmental dimensions in agricultural production planning as a state
    policy, while avoiding practices that hinder food demand or cause excessive price
    increases due to climate impacts on agriculture.
  4: The Russian Federation is an outlier, where agricultural production is very low
    in comparison to other Eurasian countries examined.
  5: The definition of Eurasia used in the study includes 103 countries from the United
    Kingdom to Japan.
  11: The study indicates that imbalances in CO2 levels in Eurasia would take approximately
    71 years to correct if conditions remain the same, while in Turkey, the CO2 level
    will be balanced every 9 months.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Macroeconomic balances of countries (potential deterioration due to food deficiency
    resulting from climate-affected agriculture)
  4: National income per capita (GDP per capita)
  5: GDP, agricultural added value
  9: Impact of share of agricultural fields, agricultural added value, GDP per capita,
    and population on CO2 emissions.
  10: A 1% increase in GDP causes a decrease of 0.04% in the CO2 level in Turkey.
  11: "GDP per capita (\u03BB) is considered as an outcome of interest, agricultural\
    \ added value (\u03C3) is considered as an outcome of interest, CO2 emissions\
    \ (Y) is considered as an outcome of interest."
  12: GDP is identified as being related to environmental destruction, with a positive
    relationship in underdeveloped countries and a negative relationship in developing/developed
    countries.
Quantitative material:
  1: Study covers the period between 1993 and 2016 years.
  4: The paper examines the trend of variables in Eurasian countries between 1993
    and 2016. The average share of agricultural added value within GDP between 1993
    and 2016 in the Russian Federation is 4.88%.
  5: Presents line graphs showing trends of CO2 emissions against agricultural land
    percentage, GDP per capita, and population in Turkey from 1993 to 2015. CO2 measured
    in million tonnes. Agricultural land as percentage of total area. GDP in per capita
    $. Population in number.
  9: Table 3 provides coefficients and t-statistics for the impact of agriculture,
    GDP per capita, and population on CO2 emissions in the long run for Eurasian countries
    and Turkey.
  10: CO2 level increases by 1.34% due to population increase in Turkey.
  11: "Table 5 presents VECM results for Eurasia and Turkey, showing short-run causality\
    \ between variables like CO2 (Y), agricultural fields (\u03C7), agricultural added\
    \ value (\u03C3), GDP per capita (\u03BB), and population (\u03B4), along with\
    \ error correction terms (ECT). The error correction term for CO2 levels in Eurasia\
    \ is -0.0141, suggesting a 0.014% correction each period; for Turkey, it is -1.325,\
    \ suggesting a 1.325% correction each period."
  12: A 2.16% population increase occurred in the Eurasian region, while Turkey experienced
    a 40.22% increase during the study period. Agricultural land share was 55.09%
    in the Eurasian region and 51.53% in Turkey.
