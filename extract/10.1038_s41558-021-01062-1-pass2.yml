    US and China are estimated to experience some of the biggest economic damages
    due to anthropogenic global warming; Brazil has the largest potential to benefit
    in multiple ways from climate mitigation efforts; Biodiversity conservation can
    be a significant part of the solution to the ongoing climate crisis.

More Notes:
  2: The paper emphasizes a 'triple win' opportunity for climate, biodiversity, and
    society through reforestation programs that focus on tree diversity.
  5: The study highlights the importance of safeguarding tree diversity as a nature-based
    climate solution, in addition to reducing emissions from industry and the energy
    sector; It also mentions the potential of restoring natural forests for climate
    stabilization and biodiversity conservation.
  13: The figure focuses on biodiversity impacts, specifically tree species loss,
    rather than macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes. It assesses the effectiveness
    of climate change mitigation in alleviating this loss under different socio-economic
    scenarios.
  14: The analysis uses five SSPs and considers the effect sizes in 14 biomes, linking
    climate (temperature and precipitation) to productivity loss. Extended Data figures
    provide more detailed information on GCM results and coarse-grid maps of effect
    sizes.
  17: Analysis focuses on the terrestrial areas; There appears to be a positive relationship
    between CSCC and CCBP, and between tree cover area and CCBP; Global productivity
    conservation is presented for each SSP (SSP1-SSP5) via a bar chart.
  19: The study does not directly quantify macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes such as
    GDP effects, productivity loss, budget balance, or ROI. It primarily focuses on
    modeling land-use changes and species distribution under different climate scenarios.
    The SSPs are combined with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to create
    mitigation scenarios.

    \ and IPBES subregion-scale. The paper looks at country-level loss of productivity\
    \ instead of the productivity loss per area."

    and their potential relationship to fossil fuel sites, which could be relevant
    for understanding ecological risks and potential areas for conservation or adaptation
    strategies.
  30: The study focuses on tree diversity-dependent productivity; Results are presented
    at the local scale and aggregated to biome level; The reference point for the
    effect size is 2005, and projections are made until the 2070s; The paper looks
    at the inverse of log(mitigation/baseline) rather than the log of that value,
    where 0 corresponds to the true absence of the outcome.

  46: Productivity loss is measured as the absolute change within each country, not
    the productivity loss per area.
  47: Results are primarily based on a comparison between baseline and mitigation
    scenarios. Caution is necessary when interpreting the results due to the contrasting
    assumptions in the different SSPs.
  58: The figure relates to changes in species richness and productivity, which are
    ecological outcomes, not directly macroeconomic or fiscal ones, though they might
    have indirect effects on these.
  62: The analysis focuses on ecological outcomes (tree diversity) and not directly
    on macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes. The information about tree diversity
    may be relevant if it can be linked to economic indicators through other channels
    (e.g., ecosystem services, tourism, agriculture).
