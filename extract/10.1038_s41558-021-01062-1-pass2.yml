Highlights:
  2: Greenhouse gas mitigation could help maintain tree diversity and thereby avoid
    a 9-39% reduction in terrestrial primary productivity. Countries that will incur
    the greatest economic damages from climate change stand to benefit the most from
    conservation of tree diversity and primary productivity. Biodiversity is a powerful
    contributor to climate stabilization.
  3: Assesses how mitigating climate change can safeguard the ability of forests to
    store carbon by reducing climate impacts on tree diversity.
  4: Climate change mitigation can substantially reduce global tree diversity loss
    and productivity loss. Colder and drier biomes benefit more from mitigation. Mitigation
    efforts conserve tree diversity and primary productivity, contributing to carbon
    storage. The effect of climate change mitigation in safeguarding forest productivity
    is spatially heterogeneous.
  5: Countries with a high social cost of carbon tend to be the countries where climate
    change mitigation could greatly help maintain primary productivity by safeguarding
    tree diversity.
  6: Diverse natural forests are crucial for carbon sequestration, ecosystem services,
    and climate stabilization. Monoculture plantations preclude opportunities for
    synergistic benefits for nature, climate, and society. The dependence of primary
    productivity on biodiversity and the contribution of tree diversity to carbon
    storage has been largely ignored in climate policy.
  7: Protection and restoration of biologically diverse forests can substantially
    contribute to climate change mitigation. Tree diversity is an important piece
    of the nature-based climate solution puzzle. Biodiversity-dependent climate change
    mitigation is important for ecosystem-based adaptation.
  12: Biodiversity-dependent productivity can contribute to climate change mitigation;
    conservation and restoration of tree diversity can enhance the positive feedback
    loop between biodiversity and climate change mitigation; unmanaged climate change
    and biodiversity loss create an amplifying feedback loop, while climate change
    mitigation and biodiversity conservation create a stabilizing feedback loop.
  13: Effective climate change mitigation policies can significantly reduce local
    tree species loss across various biomes, with reductions ranging from 3.0% to
    61.3% depending on the biome and SSP.
  14: Climate change mitigation can lead to a 8.8-38.9% reduction in productivity
    loss related to tree diversity.
  15: SSP variations demonstrate differences in biome contributions; changes appear
    significant especially in SSP3 where the contrast between baseline and mitigation
    is notable.
  17: The largest values of CCBP are found in Brazil across all SSPs. There is a relationship

    of these effect sizes across different SSPs and GCMs.
  32: The analysis shows how different biomes benefit in terms of productivity loss
    reduction due to biodiversity under various scenarios, with some biomes showing
    more significant reductions than others across the models.
  33: Positive effect sizes indicate more effectiveness of mitigation policy (green
    arrows), while negative values indicate less effectiveness (red arrows). Effectiveness
    varies across regions and SSPs (particularly across regions in Asia).
  34: The analysis demonstrates how different climate models and socio-economic pathways
    influence the economic impacts of carbon emissions across countries, in terms
    of tree productivity conservation.

    compared to a baseline scenario.
  43: The study estimates changes in species diversity due to the co-extinction and
    co-immigration of species, focusing on the impact of common species loss on rarer
    species.

    \ the period of 2070s in each of the coarse grids (32,677 grids) and \u03B1-diversity\
    \ (local diversity) for the year 2005 and the period of 2070s."

    changes in forest productivity (kg C m-2 yr-1) based on climate/land-use change
    scenarios.

    \ number of common species that go extinct or immigrate. They then use these predictions\
    \ to estimate changes in alpha diversity. Then they estimated proportional changes\
    \ in habitable area for the 2070s with SAR and EAR. These estimations were used\
    \ to predict \u03B1-diversity in the 2070s."

    (GAMM) with CSCC as an explanatory variable and GCMs as a random effect.
  47: Summed up the reduction in productivity loss across all countries, under each
    of SSPs and GCMs. Comparison between baseline and mitigation scenarios.
  48: MaxEnt models were built with linear and quadratic features only, model averaging
    of 10 replicates, parameter tuning for the regularization parameter (beta) in
    MaxEnt models based on AICc. Climate data was based on the average of 1960-1990.
    Land use data was based on 2005. Occurrence data extended to 2015.
  49: Species distribution models were built using MaxEnt v3.3 to project the distribution
    of tree and shrub species. Models used occurrence data from GBIF (as of July 22nd,
    2015). Native ranges were determined using the IUCN Red List. Sampling bias was
    addressed using a bias background approach. Analyses were conducted in R ver.
    3.3.2 using several packages including rgdal, raster, rJava, dismo, ENMeval, and
    usdm. Fine-scale analysis used a 30 arcsecond grid, and coarse-scale used a 30
    arcminute grid. Only species with 30 or more refined occurrence records were used.
    Background data was determined as 20% of the grids which contain the occurrence
    record of the target taxonomic group.
  50: Model performance was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation; Climate data
    at 30 arcsecond resolution was used directly for fine-scale analysis; For coarse-scale,
    climate data at 30 arcseconds was averaged to 30 arcminutes and used to calculate
    the 19 bioclimatic variables
  51: "Climatic data were calculated using the \u201Caggregate\u201D function [raster\
    \ R package] and \u201Cbiovars\u201D function [dismo R package]. Land-use changes\
    \ were estimated by the AIM/CGE model based on future land-use variables generated\
    \ by Fujimori, et al. The analysis uses five SSPs (SSP1, SSP2, SSP3, SSP4, SSP5)\
    \ with different socioeconomic conditions. Radiative forcing level of 2.6 W m\u2212\
    2 for the mitigation scenario under SSP1, 2, 4, and 5 is used."
  52: "Species distribution models (SDMs) were used to model habitat suitability under\
    \ different climate scenarios (2050s and 2070s, averages of 2041-2060 and 2061-2080\
    \ respectively). Multicollinearity was addressed by excluding variable pairs with\
    \ Pearson\u2019s correlation \u2265 |0.70| or a variance inflation factor \u2265\
    \ 5. MaxEnt was used for the SDMs, with parameter tuning and feature restrictions\
    \ (linear and quadratic). Predictions were bounded by clamping in MaxEnt. An average\
    \ of the 90% sensitivity threshold was used for habitat suitability. Model quality\
    \ was evaluated using the continuous Boyce index (CBI) based on 10-fold cross-validation."
  53: MaxEnt model used to predict probability of occurrence, converted to binary
    map using a threshold. Suitable habitat areas outside current and historically
    connected ranges are discarded. Future habitats constrained by estimated dispersal
    distance, calculated using species-specific dispersal syndrome, growth form, and
    generation length.
  55: The narratives are used as qualitative inputs into climate models and impact
    assessments.

    a possible future world.
  57: Uses spatially explicit simulations and machine learning regressions for biodiversity
    and productivity projections, considering species abundance distributions and
    socioeconomic pathways.
  59: The methodology involves downscaling changes in species richness from gamma-scale
    to alpha-scale using species-area relationships (SAR) and endemic-area relationships
    (EAR). It also involves coextinction simulation.
  60: Results from a mitigation scenario were compared with those based on a baseline
    scenario.
  61: "The analysis is based on means and standard errors of proportional changes\
    \ in \u03B1-diversity calculated across three GCMs (n = 32,670 grids) within coarse\
    \ grids, for five SSPs. Individual GCM results are in Extended Data Figure 1."
  62: "Means and standard errors of proportional changes (%) in \u03B1-diversity were\
    \ calculated across three General Circulation Models (GCMs) (n = 32,670 grids)\
    \ for five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)."
More Notes:
  1: This page is primarily an author and affiliation list. The title suggests the
    paper will address the connection between biodiversity, productivity, and climate
    solutions, but this page itself offers no specific details on the analysis or
    its findings.
  2: Highlights the need for nature-based solutions and emphasizes the potential for
    a triple win for climate, biodiversity, and society through reforestation programs.
  3: Focuses on tree and shrub species across all terrestrial biomes and considers
    subregions of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and
    Ecosystem Services (IPBES).
  4: The study acknowledges that warming could alter the diversity-productivity relationship,
    and that responses can vary by region. Substantial land-use changes for stringent
    mitigation efforts could have detrimental effects on biodiversity in some regions.
  5: The US and China, as the two biggest carbon emitters, have a great responsibility
    and opportunity to mitigate emissions by maintaining tree diversity. Brazil has
    the largest potential to benefit in multiple ways from climate mitigation efforts.
    Canada and Russia, despite potentially benefiting from warming, are vital in considering
    biodiversity-dependent productivity as a nature-based solution due to their large
    forests and recent tree cover loss.
  6: The paper acknowledges uncertainties in projections due to limited species data
    and potential for new species combinations under climate change. It calls for
    a dual focus on both the quantity and quality of forest ecosystems for climate
    stabilization.
  7: Nature-based approaches are only one option, and substantial reductions in energy
    emissions and the transition to renewable sources of energy are also necessary.

    highlighting a positive feedback loop that is often overlooked. The diagrams illustrate
    the interconnectedness of climate, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration.

    \ productivity loss, implying improvements compared to the business-as-usual scenario.\
    \ The land use and vegetation type distributions are visualized across different\
    \ SSPs and models, but the quantitative impact of these changes on productivity\
    \ isn't directly extracted."

    mitigation strategies across different regions and scenarios, with a focus on
    tree productivity.

    agriculture, land-use, and energy sectors to model mitigation.
  41: Uses SSPs and RCPs to define socioeconomic and climate mitigation scenarios.
    Merges bioenergy crops and afforestation into cropland and forests. Discards models
    with poor performance based on CBI.
  42: The study explicitly considers species dispersal ability and addresses scaling
    issues in biodiversity assessments.
  43: The study acknowledges that species extinction can occur non-randomly, but chooses
    a random extinction approach to cover a range of possibilities due to uncertainty
    in future land-use patterns. Extinction scenarios consider up to half of common
    species being lost.
  45: "The study acknowledges that changes in tree stem volume, used to calculate\
    \ \u03B8, may not fully capture total NPP. The study analyzes both forested and\
    \ non-forested biomes where tree species are observed and \u03B8 values are available."
