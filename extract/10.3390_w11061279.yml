Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change leading to increased extreme precipitation events in the Northeastern
    US.
  14: Changes in extreme precipitation events (increases in peak flow (PF) estimates)
    due to climate change under low (RCP4.5) and high (RCP8.5) emissions scenarios.
    Specifically, changes to exceedance probabilities related to extreme precipitation
    events.
  16: Increased frequency of extreme weather events (implicitly, water-related events,
    given the journal). The main driver specifically assessed is climate change as
    expressed through RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.
  17: Extreme precipitation events
Highlights:
  1: Extreme precipitation events are likely to increase in the Northeastern US, with
    an event currently considered a 100-year event potentially becoming a 27-year
    event under RCP4.5 and a 19-year event under RCP8.5 in the second half of the
    21st century.
  14: Peak flow estimates are projected to increase, especially in the second half
    of the 21st century under a high emissions scenario. The magnitude of the increase
    in PF estimates is larger under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5).
  16: Extreme weather events in the Northeastern US will become more frequent in the
    future under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, with a significant increase in
    the exceedance probability of a 100-year event under RCP8.5.
  17: PF estimates are likely to continue increasing, regardless of the emission scenario.
    The largest increases were in the northernmost part of the domain while the southern
    areas showed smaller increases.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of observed and modeled daily precipitation frequency (PF) estimates
    in the Northeastern US on the raingauge station scale based on both annual maximum
    series (AMS) and partial duration series (PDS) methods. Four Coupled Model Intercomparison
    Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) downscaled data sets are employed. Projections are made
    under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for the second half of the 21st century.
  14: Uses UWPD and LOCA datasets to project changes in peak flow (PF) estimates under
    different emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Employs Generalized Extreme
    Value (GEV) distribution to calculate exceedance probabilities based on annual
    maximum series (AMS). Analysis focuses on changes to exceedance probabilities
    of historical PF estimates.
  16: The paper uses exceedance probabilities derived from climate models (UWPD and
    LOCA) to assess changes in the frequency of extreme events. The analysis spans
    from 1960-2005 (historical) to 2006-2053 and 2054-2100 (future projections) under
    RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The analysis specifically uses Equations (7) and
    (8) which calculate exceedance probabilities.
  17: "Based on observational and model projected data, we examined the point precipitation\
    \ frequency (PF) estimates for the periods of 1960\u20132005, 2006\u20132053,\
    \ and 2054\u20132100 in the Northeastern US using downscaled data sets (LOCA,\
    \ BCCAv2, and NA-CORDEX), along with a probabilistic downscaled dataset developed\
    \ speci\uFB01cally for this study (UWPD)."
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the Northeastern US. The results are relevant for evaluating
    future infrastructure projects and improving management and planning decisions
    in the context of changing precipitation patterns.
  14: The paper argues for using exceedance probability instead of return period due
    to misconceptions associated with the latter. The differences between the UWPD
    and LOCA data may be related to the ability of models to simulate extratropical
    cyclones.
  17: The analysis focuses on the Northeastern US.

Quantitative material:
  1: "An event with a current exceedance probability of 0.01 (a 100-year event) may\
    \ have an exceedance probability for the second half of the 21st century of \u2248\
    \ 0.04 (a 27-year event) under the RCP4.5 scenario and \u2248 0.05 (a 19-year\
    \ event) under RCP8.5."
  14: PF estimates increase by a mean value of 12% (RCP8.5) / 11% (RCP4.5) for a return
    period of 25 years and 14% (RCP8.5) / 17% (RCP4.5) for a return period of 100
    years in the first half of the 21st century (UWPD data). LOCA data shows smaller
    increases of 8%/8% (RCP8.5/RCP4.5) and 9%/10% (RCP8.5/RCP4.5) for those same return
    periods in the first half of the 21st century. By the second half of the 21st
    century, increases are over 20% for both UWPD and LOCA data sets under the RCP8.5
    scenario. Some stations around northern Maine show an increase of 50% for a return
    period of 100 years (UWPD data, RCP8.5).
  16: "Under the RCP8.5 scenario, the exceedance probability for the 100-year event\
    \ (0.01) will increase to \u22480.04 for the second half of the 21st century in\
    \ the Northeastern US."
  17: "Under the RCP4.5 scenario, for the UWPD data set, the average projected increases\
    \ to the 100-year event are 10.79% for the \uFB01rst half of the 21st century\
    \ and 16.90% for the second half. The corresponding increases under RCP8.5 are\
    \ 14.18% for the \uFB01rst half of the 21st century and 26.75% for the second\
    \ half."
