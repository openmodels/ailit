Drivers of Risk:
  1: Changes in climate, specifically increases in extreme precipitation events.
  2: Changes in precipitation extremes and future dates are impacting outcomes.
  3: The study focuses on annual precipitation maxima in the northeastern U.S., with
    an emphasis on local maxima occurring along the northern Appalachian Mountains.
  4: Changes in precipitation (amount and occurrence)
  6: The page details the impact of different threshold values for generating PDS,
    which affects the estimation of precipitation frequency.
  7: Rain gauge station data, downscaled model data (UWPD and LOCA), different thresholds
    for PDS analysis (PDS2, PDS3, PDS qt98), and AMS.
  8: Biases in model data can lead to dry or wet estimates for extreme precipitation
    frequency (PF) events.
  9: PF estimates (likely peak flow estimates, inferred from context about return
    periods)
  10: The analysis deals with precipitation as a driver, specifically looking at risk
    factors related to biases in modeled data for PF estimates.
  11: Downscaled climate data (UWPD, LOCA, BCCAv2, NA-CORDEX) for different return
    periods.
  12: The changes in PF are driven by climate changes under the RCP4.5 scenario, indicating
    how future precipitation events might deviate from historical patterns.
  13: Projected changes in peak flow (PF) under climate change scenarios (RCP8.5 and
    RCP4.5).
  15: "Changes in GEV distribution parameters (\xB5, \u03C3, \u03BE) estimated from\
    \ projected future climate data (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios) affect exceedance\
    \ probabilities of historical precipitation events."
  17: Increased point precipitation frequency (PF) due to climate change, specifically
    under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.
  18: Extreme precipitation events are the primary driver of risk.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Extreme precipitation events and their frequency estimates in the Northeastern
    US.

  7: Evaluation of the performance of downscaled model data in reproducing observed
    features of mean Annual Maximum Series (AMS), Peaks-Over-Threshold (PDS), and
    Probable Maximum Flood (PF) estimates for different return periods.
  9: No relevant information

    precipitation frequency (PF), with a focus on correlation coefficients and RMSE.
  11: Peak flow (PF) estimates
  12: The paper evaluates future changes in precipitation frequency (PF) for 25-year
    and 100-year return periods under the RCP4.5 emission scenario.
  13: No relevant information
  15: Extreme precipitation events (maximum daily precipitation).
  17: Extreme precipitation events in the Northeastern US
  18: The study focuses on extreme precipitation events and their projected changes,
    with the goal of informing design decisions to protect socio-economic and environmental
    interests.
Highlights:
  1: Extreme precipitation event frequency estimates are likely to increase in the
    Northeastern US under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, with differences in magnitudes
    and spatial distributions between the two data sets and scenarios. A 100-year
    event could become a 27-year event under RCP4.5 and a 19-year event under RCP8.5.
  2: The goal is to find the data sets with the best overall historical accuracies
    to produce projected PF estimates and to quantify how the exceedance probabilities
    of the historical PF estimates are likely to change in the future under certain
    emission scenarios.  The results will examine and highlight the need to reevaluate
    the existing PF estimates in the light of climate change.
  4: No relevant information
  6: The comparison of PF estimates from AMS and PDS provides a more comprehensive
    understanding of how downscaled data simulate observed features.
  7: UWPD data generally has less than 10% error compared to observations for AMS
    and PDS, without systematic biases. LOCA data shows systematic dry biases, with
    errors exceeding 20% for most stations.
  8: UWPD data capture major features of observed precipitation frequency estimates,
    especially for shorter return periods.
  9: LOCA data consistently underestimates PF estimate values across all the return
    periods, indicating a dry bias. LOCA data can capture the observed spatial variations
    relatively well. Standard deviations of the LOCA data are smaller than for the
    UWPD data. UWPD data tends to overestimate PF estimates.
  10: The UWPD data set outperformed others for all return periods in terms of skill,
    with LOCA being the second best after bias correction.
  11: UWPD data were shown to capture major features of the observed PF estimates
    the best. LOCA data is widely used by government reports.
  12: Key outcomes highlight mean change ratios; e.g., UWPD for 25-year events shows
    9.14% change for 2006-2053 and 14.80% for 2054-2100.
  13: Under the RCP4.5 scenario, the analysis shows a 9% mean increase in peak flow
    estimates for a 25-year return period in the first half of the 21st century. The
    magnitude of change varies geographically, with areas like New Jersey and southeast
    New York experiencing smaller changes, and areas north of Maine experiencing larger
    changes.
  15: Projected exceedance probabilities for historical extreme precipitation events
    are larger in the future. A 100-year event may become a 35-year event (first half
    21st century) and a 27-year event (second half) under RCP4.5. Under RCP8.5, a
    100-year event may become a 19-year event.
  17: "PF estimates are likely to continue increasing in the Northeastern US, regardless\
    \ of the emission scenario. The largest increases are projected in the northernmost\
    \ part of the domain, while the southern areas show smaller increases. An event\
    \ with a current exceedance probability of 0.01 (a 100-year event) may have an\
    \ exceedance probability for the second half of the 21st century of \u22480.04."
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of observed and modeled daily precipitation frequency (PF) estimates
    in the Northeastern US using annual maximum series (AMS) and partial duration
    series (PDS) methods, employing four CMIP5 downscaled data sets. The two data
    sets with the best historical accuracy were used to project PF estimates under
    RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.
  2: "The study uses downscaled CMIP5 model output to analyze point PF estimates for\
    \ rain gauge stations in the Northeastern US. It compares modeled PF estimates\
    \ with observational PF estimates and among different models for a historical\
    \ period (1960\u20132005). Models that better reproduce historical data are used\
    \ to project future PF estimates under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5."
  3: "The analysis examines observational data from 753 rain gauge stations with over\
    \ 80% data coverage from 1960\u20132005, to ensure consistent comparisons with\
    \ climate model outputs."
  4: "Uses the University of Wisconsin Probabilistic Downscaling (UWPD) dataset, a\
    \ statistically downscaled product based on CMIP5 model output for the Central\
    \ and Eastern United States and Southern Canada at a 0.1x0.1 degree resolution.\
    \ The downscaling is probabilistic, using large-scale climate model variables\
    \ to determine the likelihood of potential values of downscaled variables. Precipitation\
    \ downscaling is divided into estimating the probability of precipitation occurrence\
    \ (logistic regression with a logit link function) and estimating precipitation\
    \ amount if the day is wet (generalized gamma distribution with parameters conditioned\
    \ on the large scale). Station data from NWS's Cooperative Observer Program (1950\u2013\
    2009) and Environment Canada\u2019s Canadian Daily Climate Data (1950\u20132007)\
    \ were used to train the statistical models. Large-scale atmospheric state was\
    \ obtained from the NCEP\u2013NCAR reanalysis. Separate fits were performed for\
    \ each calendar month to account for seasonality."
  5: Probability of Frequency (PF) estimates are based on annual maximum series (AMS)
    and partial duration series (PDS) of daily precipitation data.
  6: The analysis uses both Annual Maximum Series (AMS) and Partial Duration Series
    (PDS) for estimating precipitation frequency (PF) and compares the two by mapping
    PDS return periods to adjusted AMS return periods.
  7: The closest model grid point to a rain gauge station was selected as its representation
    in the model. The analysis compares the 1960 to 2005 climatology (averages) of
    observed AMS and PDS with UWPD and LOCA data. Difference ratios are calculated
    as (model - observation)/observation.
  8: PF estimates across return periods of 2, 25, and 100 years are compared between
    downscaled data (UWPD and LOCA) and observed data.
  9: Comparison of PF estimates based on observations with those from UWPD (Unified
    Wind Power Density) and LOCA downscaled data for return periods of 2, 25, and
    100 years; assessment using R, RMSE, and AIC.
  10: The analysis compares observed precipitation data with different downscaled
    data sets using correlation coefficients and RMSE as metrics, employing methods
    like AMS and PDS to calculate PF estimates.
  11: The analysis compares four downscaled datasets (UWPD, LOCA, BCCAv2, NA-CORDEX)
    for their ability to estimate peak flows. The best-performing dataset (UWPD) is
    selected for future projections (2006-2100), with parallel calculations using
    LOCA. Analysis is performed using Annual Maximum Series (AMS).
  12: Analysis is performed by comparing future projections (2006-2053 and 2054-2100)
    with historical precipitation frequency data using UWPD and LOCA methodologies.
  13: Analysis based on UWPD data. Results are applicable for the first half of the
    21st century under RCP4.5, and across multiple decades under RCP8.5. Examines
    peak flow estimates for 25-year and 100-year return periods.
  15: "Uses the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution to model annual maximum\
    \ daily precipitation. Estimates GEV parameters (\xB5, \u03C3, \u03BE) from historical\
    \ and projected data using methods like maximum likelihood or L-moments. Calculates\
    \ exceedance probabilities using the CDF of the GEV distribution. Compares historical\
    \ exceedance probabilities to future exceedance probabilities for the same historical\
    \ precipitation event."
  17: "The study examined point precipitation frequency (PF) estimates for the periods\
    \ of 1960\u20132005, 2006\u20132053, and 2054\u20132100 in the Northeastern US\
    \ using downscaled data sets (LOCA, BCCAv2, and NA-CORDEX) and a probabilistic\
    \ downscaled dataset developed specifically for this study (UWPD). The analysis\
    \ evaluates the ability of these datasets to reproduce observed PF estimate features.\
    \ Results are applicable to the Northeastern US."
More Notes:
  2: The study uses four downscaled CMIP5 precipitation data sets, including three
    commonly used ones and a fourth probabilistic dataset. The UWPD dataset uses 24
    IPCC models. The paper is organized to present data, methodology, comparisons,
    projections, discussion, and conclusions.
  4: The parameters of the generalized gamma distribution depend on daily varying
    large-scale atmospheric conditions. The parameters of the probability density
    functions are interpolated in space. Random numbers are drawn from the PDFs to
    generate a 'realization' of the small scale.
  5: The NA-CORDEX dataset is dynamically downscaled and not fully generated yet.
  7: The range of observed AMS climatology is 40 to 120 mm, with larger values typically
    along the coast and smaller values inland. The spatial distributions of PDS are
    similar to each other. Some results for BCCAv2 and NA-CORDEX data will also be
    provided at the end of this section, although they are not discussed on this page.
  9: The analysis compares two downscaling methods (UWPD and LOCA) against observational
    data, assessing their ability to reproduce peak flow estimates at different return
    periods. The figures also examine AMS, PDS2, PDS3 and PDS qF98, possibly different
    models or variations within UWPD.
  11: 'The projected data (2006-2100) is divided into two periods: 2006-2053 and 2054-2100
    due to a trend in the 95-year period.'
  13: The maps show that higher mean change ratios occur in the latter period (2054-2100)
    than in the earlier period (2006-2053) under RCP8.5.
  15: Analysis is performed for the Northeastern US using UWPD and LOCA data.
  17: The paper also presents domain-averaged return periods with their uncertainties
    for various time periods and RCP scenarios for the UWPD and LOCA datasets. The
    Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Great Lakes to the west, and the Appalachian Mountains
    to the south play a role in the regional climate.
Quantitative material:

    \ under RCP8.5."
  2: PF estimates are compared for a historical period (1960-2005) using downscaled
    CMIP5 precipitation data and observational data, with the goal of producing projected
    PF estimates under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.
  4: No relevant information
  5: Bias correction factors were applied with values of 1.05 for BCCAv2, 1.09 for
    0.22 degrees NA-CORDEX, and 1.16 for 0.44 degrees NA-CORDEX.
  6: For example, a PDS return period of 2 years is equated to an AMS return period
    of 2.54 years.
  7: UWPD data has less than 10% error compared with observational results for both
    AMS and PDS. LOCA data shows systematic dry biases with difference ratio magnitudes
    of over 20% for AMS and PDS, especially PDS qt98.
  8: The RMSE for UWPD PF estimates is approximately 4.5 mm for 2-year return, 13
    mm for 25-year return, and 25 mm for 100-year return periods.
  9: Spatial correlation coefficients between LOCA data and observations are quite
    high.
  10: The correlation coefficients (R) and RMSE values for various precipitation frequency
    datasets are provided, indicating the accuracy of different downscaling methods.
  11: PF correlations between observed data and downscaled data; RMSE of PF estimates
    for downscaled data.
  12: The analysis provides percentage change ratios from historical data, with detailed
    maps showing changes for 25-year and 100-year return periods using different methodologies
    (UWPD and LOCA).
  13: Under RCP4.5 for the first half of the 21st century, PF estimates increase by
    a mean relative ratio of 0.09 (9%) for a 25-year return period. Some areas experience
    smaller changes (0%-5%) while others experience larger changes (20%-30%).
  15: "Historical 2-year event (60 mm rainfall) exceedance probability changes from\
    \ 0.5 to \u22480.59 (first half 21st century) and 0.65 (second half) under RCP4.5\
    \ using UWPD data. Historical 25-year event (107 mm) changes from \u22480.04 to\
    \ \u22480.07 (first half) and 0.09 (second half). Historical 100-year event (138\
    \ mm) changes from \u22480.01 to \u22480.03 (first half) and \u22480.04 (second\
    \ half) under RCP4.5 using UWPD data.  Under RCP8.5, the 100-year event exceedance\
    \ probability may increase to 0.05 (second half) with UWPD data."
  17: Under the RCP4.5 scenario, for the UWPD data set, the average projected increases
    to the 100-year event are 10.79% for the first half of the 21st century and 16.90%
    for the second half. The corresponding increases under RCP8.5 are 14.18% for the
    first half of the 21st century and 26.75% for the second half.
  18: "Under RCP4.5, the probability of exceeding the UWPD 27-year event is \u2248\
    0.04. Under RCP8.5, the probability of exceeding the UWPD 19-year event is \u2248\
    0.05, according to the UWPD data."
