Drivers of Risk:
  3: Anthropogenic emissions, changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration, and the calibration
    of the carbon cycle and temperature models.
  4: Model uncertainty regarding equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and transient
    climate response (TCR) impacting climate change projections and potentially influencing
    economic analyses.
  5: Uncertainty in climate science, functional form of damage function, discount
    factor (growth rate and interest rate), emissions scenarios, temperature changes
    due to increased CO2 emissions (instantaneous carbon pulse).
  6: Incorrect calibration of the climate module (temperature equations and carbon
    cycle) in the DICE-2016 model, oversensitivity of SCC to the discount rate.
  7: CO2 emissions and their impact on global temperature.
  23: Emissions, temperature, exogenous forcing (F_EXt) changing linearly with time,
    damage function
  24: Different climate model calibrations (CDICE, HadGEM2-ES, GISS-E2-R, MESMO),
    emission scenarios (RCP8.5, RCP2.6), and growth-adjusted interest rates.
  25: Temperature equation uncertainty, extreme carbon cycle, alternative damage functions
    (linear, quadratic, cubic), emissions scenarios, discount rates, miscalibration
    of climate models (ECS parameter).
  26: Uncertainty in climate models, particularly the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity
    (ECS), and the choice of discount factor.
  28: "Uncertainty in climate models, carbon cycle, temperature equations, differences\
    \ in the IES-parameter \u03C8."
  29: Different climate calibrations (carbon cycle, temperature equation), total factor
    productivity (TFP) growth, population growth.
  30: Choice of the damage function
  31: The drivers of risk are miscalibrations in the DICE-2016 model concerning the
    carbon cycle and the temperature equation.
  33: Flaw in the carbon cycle dominates and leads to so little mitigation that the
    temperature rises by more than 4 K.
  34: "The elasticity of intertemporal substitution (IES, denoted by \u03C8)"
  35: Differences in expected future interest rates significantly impact optimal policies.

Highlights:
  1: Demonstrates that the appropriate choice of free model parameters in climate
    emulators can be of key relevance for the predicted social cost of carbon.
  4: The importance of considering model uncertainty in economic treatment of climate
    change and using ECS and TCR parameters to understand the economic implications
    of different climate scenarios.
  5: "Commonly used CEs in economics, including Nordhaus\u2019 widely used DICE-2016\
    \ model, seem seriously \uFB02awed in that they cannot reproduce the evolution\
    \ of atmospheric CO2 and temperature for the basic test case of an instantaneous\
    \ carbon pulse to the present-day atmosphere. The functional form of the CE in\
    \ DICE-2016 is \uFB01t for purpose and can be re-calibrated to match results from\
    \ test cases. Model uncertainty from climate science can significantly change\
    \ the SCC."
  6: The incorrect calibration of the climate module in DICE-2016 leads to an SCC
    that is oversensitive to the discount rate. DICE-2016 predicts carbon taxes that
    are too low, resulting in temperature responses outside of the CMIP5 range under
    optimal mitigation.
  23: Compensating errors play an important role in DICE-2016; DICE-2016 fails and
    warms far too much toward 2100 in strong mitigation scenario RCP26; In the BAU
    case of the DICE-2016 model, the effects of the climate model on emissions and
    the interest rates are indeed tiny
  24: 'The functional form of damage functions is important, and higher-order terms
    can significantly affect the effect of climate model uncertainty on the SCC; SCC
    is analyzed under two RCP emission scenarios: RCP85 (high emissions) and RCP26
    (low emissions)'
  25: Climate model uncertainty can significantly impact SCC, particularly with pessimistic
    scenarios. The shape of the damage function (linear, quadratic, cubic) strongly
    influences the SCC and its sensitivity to emissions scenarios and model uncertainty.
    The concavity in the forcing equation counters the convexity of damages, making
    the overall shape of the cost function unknown a priori.
  26: Varying only the ECS parameter in climate emulators is not a sufficient proxy
    for climate model uncertainty, leading to an underestimation of the uncertainty
    in the SCC. The DICE-2016 model can significantly underestimate or overestimate
    the SCC compared to CDICE depending on the discount factor used.
  28: Different reasonable calibrations for the CE can have large effects on the optimal
    abatement. The assumed climate parameters have a quantitatively insignificant
    effect on BAU emissions via differences in damages because the damages only become
    large once emissions have started to decline substantially.
  29: Different climate calibrations result in vastly different predictions for CO2
    concentrations and, consequently, temperatures and damages. The range of plausible
    damages in 300 years varies significantly depending on the climate calibration
    used. SCC initially falls over time due to the rise in the growth-adjusted interest
    rate.
  30: Optimal emissions stay far above RCP26, implying the optimal temperature rises
    far above the Paris limit; Differences in climate calibrations lead to huge differences
    in optimal mitigation over the next 80 years; The model's optimal tax lies, for
    the MMM case, slightly below what is typically discussed for economic policy purposes.
  31: DICE-2016 overestimates carbon in the atmosphere and initially underestimates
    temperature increase compared to other climate model calibrations.
  33: DICE-2016 leads to much larger damages and much higher temperatures than CDICE,
    but the SCC is almost identical. Discounting is crucial for the small differences
    in abatement between the two calibrations.
  34: "The SCC is sensitive to the growth-adjusted interest rate, which is affected\
    \ by the IES (\u03C8). Different values of \u03C8 lead to significant differences\
    \ in the SCC, with variations exceeding 50%."
  35: Significant discrepancies in outcomes when using miscalibrated climate models
    like DICE-2016, especially regarding temperature projections.

Methodology:
  1: Proposes a calibration and evaluation strategy for climate emulators used in
    economic models, using freely available benchmark data from climate sciences.
  3: The paper develops a comprehensive suite of tests to assess climate emulators
    (CEs) used in economics, focusing on aligning them with state-of-the-art climate
    science. It advocates for four test cases standard in climate science (CMIP),
    using two for calibration and two for evaluation. The approach includes calibrating
    the carbon cycle and temperature models independently, using one test case for
    each with intermediate and extreme calibration targets.
  4: The analysis uses calibration targets and climate models (e.g., HadGEM2-ES and
    GISS-E2-R) to assess uncertainty in climate sensitivity and climate responses,
    which affects projections of economic costs of climate change.
  5: Calibration strategy applied to the climate part of the DICE-2016 model. Calibration
    of climate emulators (CE) to match results from multi-model mean as well as concerning
    CMIP5 extreme cases. Comparison of carbon cycle and temperature equations to benchmark
    data and other climate models (Geoffroy et al., 2013). Examination of the impact
    of different climate calibrations on the optimal price of carbon in a simple partial
    equilibrium setup. Assumes an aggregate damage function determines what fraction
    of output is destroyed as a function of the temperature.
  6: "Uses the DICE-2016 economic model and re-calibrated versions (\u201CCDICE\u201D\
    ) to compute SCC and optimal mitigation. Compares results with DICE-2016 under\
    \ the same economic parameters. Performs partial and general equilibrium analysis."
  7: Calibration of climate emulators (CEs) used in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs),
    focusing on temperature changes in response to CO2.
  23: IAMs compute the net present value of all future damages; constant interest
    and growth rates are assumed; the temperature influences the economic activity
    via a damage function that multiplies total output; DICE-2016 and CDICE models
    are used
  24: Compares SCC under different climate models and emission scenarios relative
    to a CDICE calibration (both temperature equations and carbon cycle calibrated
    to the MMM), varying the growth-adjusted interest rate.
  25: Stylized exercise using different damage functions (linear, quadratic, cubic)
    and climate model parameters to assess the impact on SCC; Analyzing the effect
    of climate model uncertainty, carbon cycle, and emissions scenarios on the SCC.
  26: The paper calibrates the CDICE model with different temperature projections
    (HadGEM2-ES, GISS-E2-R) and compares the resulting SCC to scenarios where only
    the ECS parameter is varied. It also compares SCC values from CDICE to those from
    the DICE-2016 model.
  28: Uses the DICE-2016 economic model combined with different calibrations for carbon-cycle
    and temperature equations (CDICE). Compares CDICE to DICE-2016. Uses "deep equilibrium
    nets" to compute solutions.
  29: Analysis uses different climate calibrations within the DICE-2016 model to assess
    the impact on damages, SCC, and the growth-adjusted interest rate. The time horizon
    extends to 300 years.
  30: Uses DICE-2016 model to analyze optimal mitigation and resulting emissions/temperature
    changes.
  31: The paper compares the DICE-2016 climate model to the CDICE model with different
    carbon cycle calibrations, including the MMM (multi-model mean) from Joos et al.
    (2013) and the extreme CDICE-MESMO case, to assess the impact of miscalibration.
  33: 'Compares two integrated assessment models (IAMs): CDICE and DICE-2016 under
    BAU and optimal abatement scenarios.'
  34: "Uses a planner's utility function and examines the impact of different values\
    \ for the IES (\u03C8) on the growth-adjusted interest rate and the SCC. The analysis\
    \ is based on the DICE-2016 calibration."
  35: "Analysis is based on comparisons of different climate calibration models (DICE-2016\
    \ vs. CDICE) with varying equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and interest rate\
    \ projections (\u03C8)."
  37: The paper discusses the importance of considering the physics covered by climate
    emulators (CEs) used in climate economics, contrasting box-model and impulse response
    function (IRF) formulations. It uses a box model for the carbon cycle, which preserves
    total carbon mass and accounts for pre-industrial equilibrium. Simple, zero-dimensional
    CEs are used for economic applications.

More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on improving the climate models used within economic analyses
    of climate change, rather than directly estimating macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
    Its focus is on calibration of climate emulators.
  3: The CE calibrations and test cases are based on CMIP5 data.
  4: The page emphasizes the significance of accurately calibrating economic models
    against climate data, including CMIP5 simulations, for understanding true costs
    and scenarios of climate change.
  6: Two different flaws in the original calibration of temperature equations and
    carbon cycle in DICE-2016 partially offset each other. The paper connects its
    analysis to existing literature on climate change and economics. Presents four
    test cases and explains how to re-calibrate the climate part of DICE.
  7: The paper focuses on the calibration and evaluation of climate emulators (CEs)
    used in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), particularly DICE, and finds that
    DICE can be re-calibrated to perform well. It argues existing historical data
    has a low signal-to-noise ratio for reliably calibrating CEs.
  12: This page focuses on the calibration and testing of climate models, specifically
    the DICE model, rather than directly quantifying macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes
    of climate change or adaptation at a national level. It describes how to improve
    the climate module of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) like DICE by rigorously
    testing and re-calibrating its carbon cycle and temperature equations.
  23: The paper will show how such change in the full model affects our quantitative
    results in the online Appendix C
  24: "The parameter \u03C82 is irrelevant for ratios of the SCC for different calibrations,\
    \ but matters for the absolute value of the SCC and for optimal abatement."
  25: The effect of climate model uncertainty does not change very much with discounting,
    at least for g-adjusted interest rates above 2%. The SCC does not change very
    much with an alternative to the emissions scenario (uniformly higher when emissions
    are very large, but relative to the effect of climate model uncertainty and the
    discount factor, the changes are small).
  26: The speed of warming is more important than the very long-run behavior of temperature
    when calculating the SCC.
  28: "SCC is equal to the optimal carbon tax if \u03BC t < 1."
  29: The effects of the carbon cycle calibration on temperatures and damages are
    not nearly as large as the effect of the calibrations of the temperature equation.
  30: The damage function in DICE-2016 and the model's lack of carbon removal are
    important factors influencing the results.
  31: The analysis suggests that flaws in climate model calibration can lead to significantly
    different projections of climate change impacts, with potential consequences for
    economic analyses that rely on these models.
  33: Discounting heavily influences the long-run temperature differences and the
    comparability of abatement efforts and SCC between CDICE and DICE-2016. The interest
    rate, which is endogenous, depends on consumption growth and the preferences of
    the representative agent.
  34: "The impact of \u03C8 on interest rates is amplified by the incorrect climate\
    \ calibration in DICE-2016."
  35: Consideration of uncertainty and different climate sensitivity scenarios can
    drastically alter policy recommendations.
  37: The paper highlights the limitations of simple climate emulators in capturing
    complex feedbacks present in the full climate system, such as those related to
    two-dimensional patterns of ocean surface temperature. It uses Supplementary Data
    publicly available on Zenodo.

Quantitative material:
  3: The paper uses the DICE-2016 model and recalibrates it (CDICE) based on climate
    science model outputs. It uses an instantaneous emission of 100 GtC as a test
    case.
  4: The page discusses calibration targets and ECS and TCR measures but does not
    provide specific quantitative data on economic outcomes.
  5: "Climate science model uncertainty can change the SCC by a factor of four if\
    \ one assumes a quadratic damage function; the RCP85 scenario reflects a \u201C\
    no policy\u201D narrative, in which total anthropogenic forcing reaches approximately\
    \ 8.5W/m2 in the year 2100; the RCP26 scenario involves aggressive decarbonization,\
    \ causing radiative forcing to peak at approximately 3 W/m2 around 2050 and to\
    \ decline to approximately 2.6W/m2 at the end of the twenty-first century."
  6: "DICE-2016 predictions for BAU temperature increases are within the plausible\
    \ range of climate science. Long-run temperature in DICE-2016 is about 1\xB0C\
    \ higher than in their calibration for both BAU and optimally mitigated scenarios."
  23: Exogenous forcing changes linearly with time from 0.5 in the year 2015 to 1.0
    in 2100; SCC relative to output is relatively constant across the next 50 years;
    reporting the SCC for the somewhat arbitrary date 2020
  24: Line graph showing SCC relative to CDICE-2.6 for different g-adjusted interest
    rates, models, and scenarios; g-adjusted interest rates range from 1.0 to 1.04;
    SCC relative to CDICE-2.6 ranges from 0.5 to 2.5.
  25: SCC can be three to five times higher for very pessimistic temperature scenarios,
    a pessimistic carbon cycle increases the SCC by about 20% relative to MMM, SCC
    for most pessimistic climate scenario can be almost eight times the SCC for most
    optimistic scenario with cubic damages.
  26: The paper quantifies the SCC for different calibrations of climate models (CDICE,
    DICE-2016) and ECS values (2.15, 4.55) relative to CDICE, and provides percentage
    differences.
  28: "Equation (13): SC C t =\u2212 (\u2202 Vt /\u2202 MAT,t)/(\u2202 Vt /\u2202\
    \ K t); Equation (14): CTt = (\u03B8 1,t / \u03C3 t) * \u03B8 2 \u03BC ^ (\u03B8\
    \ 2 \u2212 1) t"
  29: Range of plausible damages in 300 years goes from around three percent of GDP
    to over 17.5% of GDP; initial population growth of 1.4% and an initial TFP growth
    of 2.25%; Initial g-adjusted interest rate is close to zero, whereas after 50
    years, it is around 2%, and then finally converges to 1.5% in the very long run.
  30: In the MMM calibration, temperature rises (relative to pre-industrial levels)
    by 3 K and stays at that level for hundreds of years. In our most pessimistic
    climate calibration, the optimal temperature rises by over 4 K.
  31: The paper references figures (Figure 15(a) and 15(b)) that illustrate the differences
    in carbon in the atmosphere and temperature response between DICE-2016 and CDICE
    calibrations.
  33: DICE-2016 warms by more than 2.5 K (as can already be seen in Figure 7) and
    stays above 2.3 K beyond 2300 while CDICE warms by 2.1 K, but warming is below
    1.8 K by 2300.
  34: "The baseline per-capita consumption growth rate is taken to be 2%, which gives\
    \ an interest rate of 4% in the DICE-2016 calibration. Differences in the SCC\
    \ between low (\u03C8=0.5) and high (\u03C8=2) values of the IES are larger than\
    \ 50%."
  35: Optimal long-run global temperatures projected based on model calibrations can
    be as high as 6 degrees above baseline in 200 years.
