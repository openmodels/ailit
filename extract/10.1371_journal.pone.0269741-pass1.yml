Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea level rise (SLR), hurricanes, coastal urban development.
  2: Sea level rise and hurricanes are identified as key drivers of risk to coastal
    communities and their built environment.
  3: Sea level rise, hurricanes
  6: Exposure to sea level rise and hurricanes are considered drivers of risk.
  7: Exposure to sea level rise (SLR) and hurricanes.
  11: Sea level rise, hurricanes, coastal development patterns (densification vs sprawl).
  13: Sea level rise (SLR) and hurricanes (total hits and wind speed).
  14: Sea-level rise and hurricane activity (cumulative storms) are the main drivers
    of risk examined.
  15: Development along U.S. coastlines; Increasing densification of coastal zones;
    Expansion of coastal settlements with low-density construction transitioned to
    densification from roughly 1980 on; Growing densification (addition of structures)
    and resulting in increasing built environment exposure along the coast; Increasing
    convergence of the density and expansion characteristics of SLR zones across regions.
  16: Natural disasters such as hurricanes and sea level rise (SLR) increase risk
    in coastal areas.
  17: Sea level rise and hurricanes; Age of building stock; Lack of adaptation in
    building codes; Old construction practices
Highlights:
  1: SLR zones developed faster and continue to have higher structure density than
    non-coastal, urban, and inland areas; density levels in historically less-developed
    coastal areas are now quickly converging on early settled SLR zones; adaptation
    policies targeting existing buildings and developed areas are likely to grow in
    importance.
  2: The research offers a fine-scale, nationwide analysis of the exposure of the
    coastal built environment to hazards over the twentieth century.
  3: Investigates trends of urban expansion into coastal areas at risk of future sea
    level rise impacts.
  6: Hurricanes can be an early indicator (through storm surge) of future SLR conditions,
    used to understand development of frequently flooded areas in comparison to other
    areas.
  7: Developed area and housing stock dramatically increased along the U.S. coastline
    between 1950 and 2000. SLR zones have higher structure density, are more developed,
    and have densified and expanded at higher rates than inland coastal areas. Coastal
    communities have greatly expanded after 1950, slowing significantly after 1980.
  11: Coastlines are more developed than inland areas; Southeast has a high exposure
    to SLR due to later development patterns; Western Gulf coast is identified as
    a potential hotspot for new building and land-use transitions.
  13: MSAs affected by hurricanes are denser and more developed than those not affected.
    Building intensity in SLR zones may be higher than in non-SLR zones following
    hurricanes.
  14: Hurricane activity is associated with significantly higher rates of building
    in terms of the proportion of built area and structure density. The impact of
    storms on the built-up share of land is largely concentrated in the SLR zones
    of MSAs.
  15: Coastal building tends to expand with low-density construction in early phases
    but transitions to densification from roughly 1980 on; Regardless of the cause
    of contemporary growing densification along coastlines, this trend leads to increasing
    exposure through added structures and increased square footage within SLR zones;
    Convergence patterns imply that the effects of the historical conditions that
    gave rise to distinctive coastal built environments may have been temporary.
  16: Built environment expansion and densification in coastal zones contribute to
    increased exposure to natural hazards.
  17: Building age is an indicator of vulnerability to natural hazards along the coast.
    Older coastal areas, particularly in the Northeast, were developed with less advanced
    or adaptive housing codes and building techniques.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of historical settlement layers from the Historical Settlement Data
    Compilation for the U.S. (HISDAC-US) to examine building patterns within and between
    the SLR zones of the conterminous United States since the early twentieth century.
  2: "The study uses gridded historical settlement data layers derived from Zillow\u2019\
    s ZTRAX database and the Historical Settlement Data Compilation of the United\
    \ States to analyze built-up property records across US coastal regions from pre-1900\
    \ to 2015. It overlays this data with sea level rise zones from NOAA. It undertakes\
    \ a century-long analysis of urbanization encompassing both passive differences\
    \ in regional building patterns between coastal and non-coastal places, and explicit\
    \ responses to hazardous conditions (hurricane events)."
  3: "Analysis of urban expansion into coastal areas at risk of sea level rise impacts\
    \ compared to inland areas using measures including built-up property density,\
    \ coastal land development, and age of buildings; utilizes Zillow\u2019s ZTRAX\
    \ dataset and HISDAC-US database."
  6: The study uses Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and Micropolitan Statistical
    Areas as units of analysis to assess how transitional units developed over time,
    similar to recent urban change assessments. It uses the HURDAT2 database to determine
    which MSAs were affected by hurricanes between 1900 and 2015, considering MSAs
    within 20km of hurricane eye landfalls as affected. It accounts for protected
    areas and wetlands by excluding them from the sea level rise (SLR) zones to constrain
    the analysis. Zonal statistics are used to determine the total number of structures,
    built interior area, and built grid cells within each SLR zone and MSA polygon
    in five-year increments from 1900 to 2015. Built Area Proportion (BAP) is calculated
    as the number of built grid cells divided by the total number of grid cells.
  7: Analysis of building trends along U.S. coastlines using settlement data. Calculation
    of structure density (S/Ap, where S is number of structures and Ap is the total
    number of developed grid cells), expansion (BAPt2 - BAPt1, where BAP is built-up
    proportion), and densification ((St2-St1)/(Apt2-Apt1)). Applies to the conterminous
    United States.
  11: Quantifying the absolute and relative exposure of MSAs to SLR by comparing the
    total number of buildings to the percentage of buildings inside SLR zones.
  13: The study uses regression analysis with census division fixed effects to estimate
    the impact of SLR and hurricane exposure on building characteristics within Metropolitan
    Statistical Areas (MSAs). The analysis covers the period from 1900-2015, with
    dependent variables measured in 2015. The estimates are relative to SLR zones
    with no storms.
  14: Panel regression analysis from 1900-2015 with MSA clustered standard errors
    and year, MSA, and year x census division fixed effects. Results are applicable
    to US MSAs (Metropolitan Statistical Areas), and potentially more so to hurricane-hit
    locations.
  17: Analysis of the age of structures using HISDAC-US data to identify vulnerable
    neighborhoods and grid cells within cities.
More Notes:
  2: The study aims to establish a robust link between coastal conditions, specifically
    hurricane activity, and the long-term spatial development of urban areas. It looks
    at long-term changes in density and expansion across areas most likely to be impacted
    by coastal hazards, delineated using NOAA-defined SLR zones and relates hurricane
    exposure to historical development and how current exposure levels are changing
    with recent building patterns.
  3: Focuses on mapping and characterizing exposure of the built environment to sea
    level rise, rather than quantifying macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes directly.
  6: The contemporary MSA boundaries were used even if the area was rural in 1900.
    The study uses the HISDAC-US dataset to compare measures of development, aggregating
    data by state and by MSA within each census division from 1900 to 2015.
  7: Densification, i.e. number of structures added per developed grid cell during
    the time period of interest, greater than one after 1980. Development patterns
    vary by US census division.
  11: The paper focuses on the changing patterns of coastal built environment exposure.
    Development has slowed in recent decades in areas exposed to SLR. The Western
    Gulf Coast, due to its relatively modest historical development intensity, is
    identified as a potential future hotspot for development and related SLR impacts.
  13: The paper uses building intensity as a proxy for economic activity. The distinction
    between 'low severity' and 'high severity' storms is based on average maximum
    wind speeds (below and above 100 mph, respectively) or number of storm hits (1-4
    and 5 or more since 1900, respectively).
  14: The paper finds a negative but less precise effect of hurricane activity on
    structure count, but only in a hurricane-hit restricted sample.
  16: Development continues in high-risk areas like the Sunbelt and Florida despite
    hurricane hits and flood risks.
  17: Density and development patterns do not fully illustrate exposure; building
    condition and adaptation also drive vulnerability. Nature-based approaches are
    an alternative to grey infrastructure for risk reduction in some areas. Retreat
    from the coastline may be the only adaptation choice in areas with very high coastal
    hazards and exposure.
