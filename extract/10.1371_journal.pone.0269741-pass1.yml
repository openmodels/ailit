  13: Share of built-up land, structure density, and total structures in MSAs within
    and outside SLR zones and with varying hurricane impacts.
  14: The paper evaluates the impact of storms and sea-level rise on built-up land
    and structure density in U.S. coastal areas.
  16: Exposure to sea level rise and hurricanes; built environment exposure
  17: This page evaluates built environment vulnerability to sea level rise and hurricanes
    by assessing the age of structures.
  18: Exposure of coastal communities has led to staggering losses and damages from
    natural hazards.
  20: Exposure to sea level rise and hurricanes; coastal flooding and affordable housing
Highlights:
  1: SLR zones have developed faster and continue to have higher structure density
    than non-coastal urban and inland areas; adaptation policies targeting existing
    buildings and developed areas are likely to grow in importance.
  2: First fine-scale nationwide analysis of the exposure of the coastal built environment
    to hazards over the twentieth century; a robust link between coastal conditions,
    specifically hurricane activity, and the long-term spatial development of urban
    areas.
  3: Investigation of exposure of the built environment over the past century and
    critical land transitions in sea level rise zones.
  4: No relevant information
  7: Developed area and housing stock dramatically increased along the U.S. coastline
    over the past century, particularly between 1950 and 2000. Coastal building transitioned
    from expansion to densification. SLR zones have higher structure density, are
    more developed, and have densified and expanded at higher rates than inland coastal
    areas.
  8: The maps highlight the extent of urban development and density in areas vulnerable
    to sea level rise, emphasizing changes over time.
  9: SLR zones and coastal MSAs are denser, more developed, and have higher rates
    of expansion than MSAs across the CONUS; developed land in Fort Meyers, FL, rapidly
    expanded after 1950 within SLR zones; structure density in Los Angeles, CA, grew
    within SLR zones after 1950.
  10: The Pacific U.S. had high rates of growth after 1950, converging to the built
    environment characteristics of the Northeast. The West South Central remains lower
    in density of structures and percent of SLR zone developed. Pacific division overtook
    New England in structure density within developed land yet remains low in percent
    of SLR.
  12: Absolute exposure to sea level rise increased across all divisions, though slowing
    between 1970 and 1980. The South Atlantic has the highest percentage of MSA structures
    in SLR zones, driven by areas like Miami, FL, and Hilton Head Island, SC. Areas
    at highest risk of hurricanes, the South Atlantic, have higher exposure across
    both absolute and relative measures. Hurricane activity tends to be associated
    with more compact and more dense building patterns.
  13: MSAs affected by hurricanes are denser and more developed than those not affected.
    The study tests whether SLR zones experienced higher growth in building intensity
    following hurricanes.
  14: Hurricane activity is associated with increased building in SLR zones; coastal
    zones are about 8% more built-up than non-coastal areas.
  15: Newer structures may be more adaptive to coastal hazards if built with modern
    building codes.
  16: Areas at risk of hurricane impacts are more highly developed than those that
    are not; coastal communities look more different if they have been hit by one
    or more hurricanes; denisified nature of development will also constrain future
    adaptation efforts with respect to climate change
  17: Older structures are identified as a possible indicator of elevated vulnerability
    due to outdated building codes and construction practices. The analysis highlights
    the potential for using building age data to identify vulnerable metropolitan
    areas and neighborhoods along the U.S. coast.
  18: Protection of developable land, particularly in the Gulf Coast, is critical
    to minimize exposure. Adaptation is crucial in already saturated and dense coastal
    communities.
  20: Identifies areas at risk, assesses the impact of climate change and development,
    and provides recommendations for mitigation and adaptation.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis uses historical settlement data (HISDAC-US) to examine building
    patterns within and between SLR zones of the conterminous U.S. since the early
    twentieth century.
  2: Analysis of historical building patterns using the Historical Settlement Data
    Compilation for the U.S. (HISDAC-US) from 1900 to 2015, overlayed with sea level
    rise zones from NOAA.
  3: Analysis of trends in urban expansion into coastal areas at risk from future
    sea level rise and comparison with inland areas using measures such as built-up
    property density and land development over time.
  5: Sea level rise zones of 3 feet and 6 feet are employed to understand differences
    in development trends under varying risk scenarios.
  6: Development metrics are calculated using data from 1900 to 2015, excluding protected
    areas and wetlands, and computing zonal statistics for SLR zones.
  7: The study measures shifts in the built-up proportion of areas over time to understand
    expansion and land cover change, using a grid cell based approach. Expansion is
    measured as the increase of the proportion of built grid cells during a given
    time period. Densification is measured as a ratio of the number of added structures
    to the number of added developed grid cells. Structure density is measured as
    the number of structures per grid cell (250m resolution). Applicable to coastal
    areas of the U.S.
  8: Maps display SLR risk areas in 1900, 1950, and 2015 in two different coastal
    regions, assessing Building Urbanization Potential Rates
  9: Built-up properties (BUPL) data from HISDAC are used to measure expansion and
    structure density; 10-year increments were used to calculate expansion and densification.
  10: 'The analysis is based on structure density per developed grid cell and calculates
    densification, proportion of the SLR zone developed, and expansion of developed
    grid cells. Coastal MSAs are aggregated to Census Divisions. '
  12: Panel regression models with fixed effects are used to estimate the impact of
    sea level rise (SLR) and storm activity on building intensity measures (total
    structures, share of built-up land, and density of structures) across coastal
    MSAs from 1900 to 2015 in 5-year time steps.  The analysis divides coastal MSAs
    into areas inside and outside of the 6-foot SLR zone.
  13: Regression analysis using 2015 data with census division fixed effects, comparing
    metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) within and out of SLR zones and exposed
    to different levels of hurricane severity (defined by wind speed and historical
    hits since 1900). Models control for geographical and temporal heterogeneity.
  14: The analysis is based on a panel regression of metropolitan statistical areas
    (MSAs) in coastal U.S. from 1900-2015, evaluating land and structure density.
  15: Analysis of settlement trajectories, revealing development patterns along the
    U.S. coastline, specifically since WWII.
  16: Analysis of built environment expansion and densification in hurricane-prone
    areas and SLR zones; the study period is assumed to be before 2015, based on the
    final line of the text
  17: The analysis uses HISDAC-US data to determine the age of structures and development
    patterns, applicable for understanding built environment vulnerability in coastal
    areas.
  18: Analysis of settlement data compilation to understand the evolution of exposure
    along the coast.
  20: Uses modeling of coastal flood risk, analysis of building performance, and statistical
    analysis of damage
More Notes:
  4: The ZTRAX database has limitations related to data quality, including spatial,
    temporal, and thematic uncertainties. The database can have commission errors
    (structures reported that don't exist) and omission errors (structures that exist
    but are not reported).
  7: The median year of construction of buildings in the 6-foot SLR zone is 1975.
    The 6-foot SLR zone is 35% developed in the year 2015. Older coastal areas, such
    as the Northeastern region of the U.S., developed early and rank high in density
    and developed area throughout the 20th century.
  8: The paper uses visual aids (maps and conceptual diagrams) to illustrate the relationship
    between urban expansion, density, and sea level rise risk.
  9: The study uses data from U.S. government datasets and those with CC0 licenses.
  10: The paper examines historical coastal development trends in the context of sea
    level rise exposure. It provides a regional breakdown of these trends.
  12: The study compares building trajectories in SLR zones with interior areas of
    the same MSAs to account for historical and geographic differences.
  13: The zero line in the graphs represents a SLR zone with no storms in the database.
    Severe levels of storm hits are defined as 5 or more storms since 1900, less severe
    as 1-4 storm hits since 1900. Results presented are relative to a SLR zone with
    no storms. The analysis focuses on cumulative hurricane events due to the consistency
    of results between hurricane events and mean wind speed.
  14: The study suggests hurricane-prone areas might result in denser urban landscapes,
    indicating the need for further local-scale studies.
  17: The study acknowledges that building age alone does not fully capture vulnerability,
    as building condition and adaptation also play significant roles, though these
    are not directly assessed due to data limitations. It also discusses adaptation
    strategies, including structural alterations, nature-based approaches, and retreat.
  18: Building size and density tended to increase after hurricanes hit an area. Business
    as usual coastal development should be avoided in favor of sustainable development,
    building policies, and coastal retreat after disaster.

  12: 'The South Atlantic division has the highest percentage of total MSA structures
    in the SLR zone (Fig 5B). Since about 1970, the percentage of total MSA structures
    in the SLR has dropped in the South Atlantic because of increasing addition of
    structures in inland areas. SLR zones historically exposed to more intense cyclonic
    activity tend to have higher proportions of built-up land and higher structure
    density (Fig 6). '
  13: Coefficient estimates (y-axis values in Figure 6) from regressions quantifying
    the relationship between dependent variables (share of built-up land, structure
    density, total structures) and independent variables (wind speed, total historical
    hits).
  14: One-unit increase in cumulative storms is associated with a 2.3 percentage point
    increase in the share of built-up land.
  16: High numbers of structures and high structure density in SLR zones in Miami,
    New York, Boston, Houston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco; South Atlantic and
    Florida have a larger relative exposure than other divisions
  17: The page presents quantitative information in the form of percentage of structures
    older than 1975 across MSAs, and visualizes development age at a fine scale.
  18: Rate of exposure growth has slowed across all divisions, possibly due to saturation
    of coastal areas and decreasing availability of developable land.
