Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme temperatures due to climate change, specifically following RCP (Representative
    Concentration Pathway) scenarios.
  2: Environmental heat exposure, temperature increases (due to climate change).
  3: Daily maximum temperature, hourly wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT).
  4: Environmental heat exposure, measured by Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT).
  5: 'Climate change, specifically temperature increases driven by different Representative
    Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. The primary shock is
    heat exposure.'
  6: Climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) impacting temperature, which
    affects labour productivity.
  7: Heat is a driver of risk, impacted by climate change and potentially exacerbated
    by the urban heat island effect.
  8: Heat events under climate change, specifically using the RCP8.5 high-greenhouse-gas
    emissions pathway.
Highlights:
  1: Current heat-related labor productivity losses cost Switzerland approximately
    CHF 665 million per year, and this could triple by the end of the century under
    a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5).
  2: Provides a detailed impact assessment and future projections for excess mortality
    and losses in labour productivity in Switzerland at the kilometre level for distinct
    population groups and activity classes; Combines mortality and labor productivity
    impacts in the same modelling framework.
  3: Increased daily maximum temperatures are correlated with increased mortality
    risk, particularly for those 75 and older. Heat reduces labour productivity, measured
    using the wet bulb globe temperature.
  4: The study models and quantifies the impact of heat exposure on labour productivity
    in Switzerland, considering different activity levels and indoor/outdoor work
    environments.
  5: Heat-related deaths are projected to increase significantly under different climate
    scenarios, with the most severe increases under RCP8.5. The elderly population
    (>=75 years) is particularly vulnerable, accounting for a disproportionate share
    of heat-related deaths. The range of uncertainty for death tolls is large.
  6: Productivity loss is projected to increase up to 65% by 2050 under the RCP8.5
    scenario, particularly affecting high physical activity work types.
  7: The economic costs of heat and the number of heat-related deaths are comparable
    to or even higher than those caused by flu in Switzerland.
  8: The monetary costs of heat and the effects on mortality are substantial already
    today, and these impacts will increase significantly by the end of the century
    under high emissions.
Methodology:
  1: High-resolution spatial analysis based on the IPCC risk framework (hazard, exposure,
    vulnerability) and Monte Carlo simulation, considering no socio-economic changes.
  2: Uses the IPCC risk framework as implemented in the open-source CLIMADA impact
    modelling platform; Combines hazard, exposure, and vulnerability to quantify socio-economic
    impacts of natural hazards; Uses high-resolution datasets, including CH2018 Climate
    Scenarios and geographical distribution of population and workers; Represents
    the link between local exposure and heat hazards by impact functions; Combines
    the three risk components using a Monte Carlo simulation to assess the uncertainties.
  3: The paper uses CH2018 climate scenarios data. It models the impact of heat on
    mortality using impact functions linking maximum temperature to excess mortality,
    based on age categories (under 75, 75+), and uses the wet bulb globe temperature
    (WBGT) to model the impact on labour productivity. The mortality analysis uses
    warm season data (May-September) between 1995 and 2013 to establish the relationship
    between temperature and daily mortality in Swiss cities.
  4: A Monte Carlo simulation is used, incorporating climate data from CH2018, a simplified
    3-D model of a typical office building in Zurich simulated with EnergyPlus, and
    company structure statistics from the FSO. Impact functions are generated to relate
    WBGT to labour productivity loss, based on empirical studies and ISO standards.
    Uncertainty analysis is performed on climate simulations, natural variability
    in climate data, WBGT calculation, and work conditions (sun/shadow).
  5: Monte Carlo simulation (1000 iterations) is used to integrate uncertainties related
    to impact functions (vulnerability). Vulnerability is characterized by normal
    distributions. The analysis calculates the average yearly impact of heat-related
    deaths. Applicable specifically to Switzerland.
  6: The analysis uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate median labour productivity
    losses across different RCP scenarios for various years, with uncertainty estimates
    included.
  7: The model projects future impacts under different climate scenarios (RCP2.6 and
    RCP8.5).
  8: Uses the IPCC risk framework, spatially explicit modeling, and Monte Carlo simulation,
    keeping socio-economic factors constant. Analysis is applicable to current and
    future climate scenarios.
More Notes:
  1: The study also models heat-related mortality, but this is not a macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcome. The analysis integrates uncertainties.
  2: The study focuses on Switzerland; The study models heat-related impacts in Switzerland
    throughout the century.
  3: The analysis focuses on Switzerland. The mortality analysis assumes that deaths
    are evenly distributed throughout the warm season and the same on each day. The
    study calculates the number of heat-related deaths per year at a hectare level
    and aggregates for the entire country.
  4: The analysis relies on several assumptions and simplifications, including the
    use of a typical office building model and the categorization of activity classes.
    Uncertainty in climate models and data variability are explicitly addressed through
    the Monte Carlo simulation. The analysis produces an estimate of national aggregate
    losses.
  5: The baseline (2020) uses the RCP8.5 scenario, and the results refer to average
    yearly impacts. The study assumes normal distributions for vulnerability uncertainty.
    The page presents figures for heat-related deaths but does not explicitly link
    these deaths to labor productivity loss or other macroeconomic/fiscal impacts.
  6: Southern cantons of Switzerland like Ticino, Valais, and Geneva show higher productivity
    loss due to climate impacts, especially in high-altitude regions that will experience
    more frequent heat impacts.
  7: Uncertainties are skewed towards higher values, with climate projections being
    the largest source of uncertainty.
  8: The model identifies areas particularly affected by heat and could be used to
    analyze adaptation measures and their effectiveness. Code and data are openly
    available.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic costs caused by losses in labour productivity in Switzerland.
  2: Losses in labour productivity, which can have important repercussions on the
    overall economy/national GDP.
  3: Labour productivity loss due to heat.
  4: Labour productivity loss due to heat exposure, expressed as a percentage.
  5: Labor productivity loss (indirectly through heat-related mortality). No specific
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes are directly modeled on this page, but labor
    productivity is an economic outcome and mortality can be considered an economic
    cost. There is no mention of adaptation.
  7: Losses in labour productivity and heat-related mortality are macroeconomic outcomes
    of interest.
  8: Monetary costs of heat and the effects on mortality and labour productivity in
    Switzerland.
Outcomes of Interest:
  6: The paper discusses labour productivity as an economic outcome, specifically
    highlighting productivity loss measured in Swiss Francs (CHF) due to climate change
    impacts.
Quantitative material:
  1: Economic costs of labor productivity loss amount to around CHF 665 million (approx.
    USD 700 million) per year currently; this may triple by the end of the century
    under RCP8.5.
  2: Mentions a study reporting a 5.4% increase in mortality in Switzerland during
    the second warmest summer on record (2015), with 77% of deaths in people older
    than 75.
  3: The paper calculates the fraction of deaths attributable to heat (AF) for each
    degree of temperature. The paper also uses population data from the Swiss Federal
    Statistical Office (FSO) and mortality data to quantify heat-related deaths per
    year at a cell level and aggregates it for the entire country.
  4: Equation (3) is presented which models national labour productivity loss as a
    function of exposed salary value and hourly predicted loss in labour productivity
    for a given WBGT. Figure 3 shows the relationship between WBGT and percentage
    of labour productivity loss for people working at a moderate physical activity.
  5: 'Baseline (2020, RCP8.5): 658 heat-related deaths per year in Switzerland. RCP2.6:
    peaks at 695 yearly heat-related deaths in 2050. RCP4.5: 814 yearly deaths in
    2050 and 854 in 2080. RCP8.5: 934 deaths per year in 2050, exceeding 1500 in 2080.
    For RCP8.5 in 2050: uncertainty range is 241-1883 deaths (5th-95th percentile).'
  6: Productivity loss in Switzerland is quantified in CHF, with current losses at
    CHF 665 million per year, projected to increase to CHF 1.1 billion per year by
    2050 under RCP8.5.
  7: In 2080, the difference in heat impacts under an RCP8.5 scenario versus the RCP2.6
    scenario is, according to the model,823(+117%)additionalheat-relateddeathsperyear
    and an increase of CHF1381 million (+170%) for labour productivity losses.
  8: Monetary costs may double (for mortality) or even triple (for labour productivity)
    by the end of the century under RCP8.5.
