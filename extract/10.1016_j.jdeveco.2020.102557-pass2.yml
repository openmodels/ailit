Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme heat negatively affects China's agricultural TFP and input utilization.
  2: Climate change, specifically temperature variations (especially extreme heat)
    and other weather variables (rainfall, sunshine duration, humidity, and wind force).
  3: Climate change (extreme heat) and future warming (global climate models HadGEM2-ES
    and NorESM1-M).
  4: Climate change, specifically global warming and temperature variation, are the
    main drivers of risk.
  5: Changes in temperature, specifically heat accumulation within different temperature
    ranges. Rainfall, sunshine duration, relative humidity, and wind force are controlled
    for.
  6: "Rising temperatures and decreasing sunshine duration; specifically, exposure\
    \ to GDD (growing degree days) above a threshold (33\xB0C)"
  8: "Extreme heating (days with temperature above 33\xB0C)"
  9: Changes in temperature (Growing Degree Days (GDD) above and below threshold),
    precipitation, sunshine duration, humidity, and wind force are drivers of risk
    impacting agricultural TFP.
  10: Changes in temperature, specifically GDD above and below certain thresholds.
  11: 'Future global warming (changes in Growing Degree Days - GDDs) under different
    Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, RCP8.5) using
    climate data derived from HadGEM2-ES and NorESM1-M global climate models.'
  12: Future warming/climate change, specifically extreme hot weather.
  13: Climate change, global warming
  14: Temperature changes, specifically growing degree days (GDD) above and below
    certain temperature thresholds.
  16: Growing Degree Days (GDD) above a threshold.
Highlights:
  1: Longer-run adaptation mitigates agricultural output loss to a greater extent
    due to flexible adjustment in labor, fertilizer, and machines.
  2: Extreme heat negatively impacts agricultural TFP and yield. Farmers adapt to
    climate change over the long run, partially mitigating the negative impacts. Adaptation
    occurs in labor, fertilizer, and land usage.
  3: Climate change has a negative impact on TFP and yield in the short run, and these
    impacts are expected to be less negative in the long run due to adaptation. Climate
    change also has a negative impact on labor and fertilizer utilization in the short
    run but a positive impact on capital stock in the long run. Climate change has
    a more negative impact on yield than on TFP in the short run.
  4: The paper predicts that in the short run, climate change has a more negative
    impact on yield than on TFP. In the long run, adaptation in yield is expected
    to be greater than the adaptation in TFP.
  5: "Adaptation is observed if the short-run effect of climate change is offset in\
    \ the long run. The ratio of long-run to short-run coefficients (\u03B2LD2 / \u03B2\
    FE2) can be interpreted as the proportion of the negative short-run effect compensated\
    \ in the long run."
  6: "There is a nonlinear, inverse U-shaped effect of temperature on agricultural\
    \ TFP, with the turning point around 33\xB0C. Exposure to GDD below threshold\
    \ slightly promotes agricultural TFP, but GDD above threshold leads to a sharp\
    \ decrease."
  8: Extreme heating reduces agricultural yield. The long differences approach also
    reveals an inverse U-shaped nonlinearity as temperature exceeds the turning point.
  9: "Extreme heating reduces agricultural yield by 2.3% in the long run with an additional\
    \ one-day cumulative exposure to temperatures above 33\xB0C."
  10: Higher GDD above threshold has significant positive impacts on both agricultural
    TFP and Yield. Adaptation measures offset 37.9% (TFP) and 46.9% (Yield) of the
    negative short-run impacts of temperature changes in the longer run. The level
    of adaptation has grown in the most recent period.
  11: "Future global warming will significantly lower China\u2019s agricultural TFP\
    \ and yield. Climate adaptation offsets a portion of these reductions, but the\
    \ offset shrinks in the long term. The impact on yield is more negative than on\
    \ TFP."
  12: Future warming is projected to negatively impact China's agricultural productivity.
    The nonlinear relationship between temperature and agricultural outcomes leads
    to a faster reduction in TFP and yield in the long term. Climate adaptation decreases
    in the long term relative to the medium term without new policy interventions.
    Significant adaptation of TFP and inputs are found, which leads to adaptation
    of yield. Farmers mitigate reduction in labor and fertilizer due to extreme hot
    weather by employing more machines.
  13: 'Future climate adaptations in agriculture are emerging from two pathways: adaptation
    in agricultural TFP and adaptations in agricultural input portfolio.'
  14: "The impact of GDD on agricultural TFP varies depending on whether it's above\
    \ or below a specific temperature threshold. Higher temperatures (above 31\xB0\
    C) have positive and statistically significant impacts on log agricultural TFP.\
    \ The relationship between temperature and TFP is not linear, there appear to\
    \ be temperature thresholds beyond which agricultural TFP is boosted."
  16: The degree to which adaptation offsets climate change is estimated.
Methodology:
  1: County-panel dataset spanning 35 years is used to evaluate impacts on agricultural
    TFP and inputs/outputs in China.
  2: Panel regressions and long differences approach using county-year panel data
    for 2495 counties in China from 1981-2015, combined with daily weather records
    from 820 weather stations. Uses piecewise linear function of temperature and temperature
    bins to capture nonlinear relationships.
  3: Econometric model based on a Cobb-Douglas production function and hypotheses
    related to climate change impacts on TFP, input utilization and yields. Analysis
    covers a 35-year study period at the county level in China.
  4: "The paper employs a stochastic frontier analysis to model agricultural production\
    \ and estimate agricultural TFPs, a panel approach to estimate the short-run impacts\
    \ of global warming, and a long differences approach to estimate the long-run\
    \ impacts. The panel approach uses growing degree days (GDD) to capture the non-linear\
    \ relationship between agricultural outcomes and variation in temperature. Temperature\
    \ is divided into fourteen 3\xB0C intervals. A Cobb-Douglas and Transcendental\
    \ Logarithmic stochastic frontier model are used. Error Components Frontier models\
    \ inef\uFB01ciency uit \xBC exp\xF0/C0 \u03B7 \xF0t /C0 T \xDE\xDEui where ui\
    \ is an i.i.d. non-negative truncation of the N(\u03BB , \u03C32 ) distribution."
  5: Compares short-run climate impacts estimated from panel data with long-run impacts
    from long differences estimates. The long differences approach involves comparing
    agricultural outcomes between two periods to estimate responses to long-run climate
    changes. A two-period panel of long differences is established to address time-varying
    unobservable factors. Bootstrapped adaptation estimates are generated to test
    the null hypothesis of zero adaptation.
  6: Uses an unbalanced county-level panel for 2495 counties in mainland China from
    1981-2015 to estimate the agricultural production function and derive TFP; employs
    a piecewise linear approach and temperature bin approach to analyze the nonlinear
    effect of temperature on agricultural outcomes.
  8: Panel estimates and long differences approach (5-year differences) are used to
    estimate the impact of climate change on agricultural TFPs and yield.
  9: Panel data analysis is used with fixed effects (county and year) and controls
    for weather variables and their second-order polynomials.  Spatial correlation
    is accounted for by clustering standard errors at the county level. A two-period
    long differences panel model is also employed.
  10: The analysis uses panel data and long difference estimations with county and
    year fixed effects. Models include CD-SFA, TL-SFA, and CD-CPF with and without
    constant returns to scale (CRS). They control for accumulative precipitation,
    sunshine duration, average relative humidity, and wind speed. Standard errors
    are adjusted for spatial correlation and clustered at the county level. The results
    are based on data from 1981-2015.
  11: "The study estimates the coefficients of GDD below and above a threshold in\
    \ a baseline model to project the impact of future global warming on agricultural\
    \ TFP in China.  It uses climate projections from WorldClim-Global Climate Data\
    \ under four RCPs for the medium (2041-2060) and long term (2061-2080), specifically\
    \ RCP2.6 and RCP8.5.  The climate data is derived from the global climate models\
    \ HadGEM2-ES and NorESM1-M. The projected changes in GDDs are calculated as the\
    \ differences between GDDs derived from future climate data and average temperatures\
    \ during the sample period (1981\u20132015). Panel data and long differences estimates\
    \ are used."
  12: County-year panel data analysis for 2495 counties in China over the period 1981-2015.
    Historical sensitivities to climate are estimated using long differences and panel
    estimates under different climate models (HadGEM2-ES, NorESM1-M) and scenarios
    (RCP2.6, RCP8.5).
  13: Panel data estimates; Inverse-distance weighting (IDW) method is employed to
    impute weather data for each county.
  14: The analysis uses an annual panel dataset with county and year fixed effects.
    Regressions are weighted by county-average farm area. Standard errors are adjusted
    for spatial correlation and clustered at the county level. Additional weather
    variables are included as controls.
  16: Standard errors are adjusted for spatial correlation and clustered at the county
    level.
More Notes:
  1: Despite climate adaptation, future climate change scenarios still imply substantial
    agricultural losses in China.
  2: The study focuses on China as the largest global agricultural emitter and developing
    country. It considers the impact of climate change on TFP and input utilization
    to understand adaptation behaviors. Mentions the 'One Exemption and Three Subsidies'
    policy as an adaptation measure.
  3: The paper identifies mechanisms by which climate change affects yield through
    its impact on TFP and input utilization, as well as adaptation behaviors.
  4: "The analysis focuses on the agricultural sector and its response to climate\
    \ change. Climate change 1) has negative impacts on labor and fertilizer utilization,\
    \ but no signi\uFB01cant impact on capital stock (machinery), and 2) has a negative\
    \ impact on TFP and a more negative impact on yield. In the long run adaptations\
    \ are expected to exist in all three inputs."
  5: Uses Chinese agricultural panel data from 1981 to 2015 at the county level. Adopts
    long differences as the benchmark approach and uses panel long differences to
    confirm robustness. Piecewise linear approach is preferred in long differences,
    and treats the estimate as the main model to evaluate the short-run effect of
    climate change.
  8: The inverse U-shape is relevant here; too little as well as too much change can
    hurt TFP.
  9: The analysis estimates weather conditions using a weighted average of weather
    stations within a 100 km radius of the county centroid. Robustness checks are
    performed using different threshold radii (50 km, 150 km, and 200 km).
  10: The paper quantifies the uncertainty of climate adaptation using a bootstrap
    procedure.
  11: The study finds that extreme heat has a negative impact on labor and fertilizer
    use, contributing to the negative impact on agricultural yield.  Adaptation in
    input utilization and TFP are witnessed in the long run.
  12: The paper finds evidence of adaptation in the agricultural sector, mitigating
    some short-run effects of climate change on TFP.
  13: The study identifies limitations, including incomplete capture of labor input
    adjustments and a lack of commodity-county-level data for decomposing the impact
    on cropping patterns and individual farm commodities.
  14: The figures illustrate the distribution of growing degree days in China and
    the sensitivity of TFP estimates to different temperature interval widths, which
    is helpful for understanding the robustness of the main result.

Quantitative material:
  1: Longer-run adaptation has offset 37.9% of the short-run effects of extreme heat
    exposure on TFP.
  2: "An increase in exposure to temperatures above 33\xB0C results in sharp declines\
    \ in agricultural TFPs. Long-run adaptations appear to have mitigated 37.9% (95%\
    \ CI, 5.3%\u201354.8%) of the short-run impacts of extreme heat exposure on China\u2019\
    s agricultural TFPs. In terms of yield, 46.8% (95% CI, 30.2%\u201358.0%) of the\
    \ short-run effect is offset in the long run."
  3: "China\u2019s agricultural TFP is projected to decline by 2\u20136% by 2050 and\
    \ by 4\u201312% by 2070."
  4: The paper does not present specific quantitative results on this page, but describes
    the construction of variables like Growing Degree Days (GDD) to be used in regression
    models.
  5: Uses a variety of temperature intervals to estimate short-run impacts, and models
    for piecewise linear effects of temperature.
  6: "Agricultural TFP is expected to decrease linearly by 2.6% with an additional\
    \ one-day cumulative exposure to temperatures above 33\xB0C during the whole year."
  8: "Yield is expected to decrease by 4.4% with an additional one-day cumulative\
    \ exposure to temperatures above 33\xB0C."
  9: "A 1\xB0C temperature interval changes in log agricultural TFP are shown in Figure\
    \ 4. Panel estimates in Table 3 show the impact of GDDs above and below thresholds,\
    \ precipitation, sunshine duration, humidity, and wind force on log(Agricultural\
    \ TFP). Longer-run adaptation has offset 46.8% and 37.9% of the short-run effects\
    \ of extreme heat on China's agriculture yield and agricultural TFP, respectively."
  10: "The study provides quantitative estimates of the impact of GDD above and below\
    \ thresholds on log(Agricultural TFP) and log(Yield), including R-squared values\
    \ for different models. Percentage of adaptation (1-\u03B2 2LD/\u03B2 2FE) * 100%\
    \ is also quantified."
  11: Agricultural TFP in China projected to reduce by 2.5-3.9% under RCP2.6 and 3.5-5.7%
    under RCP8.5 (HadGEM2-ES model, medium term, 2041-2060).  Corresponding declines
    in TFP are smaller under the NorESM1-M model, by 1.9-3.1% under RCP2.6 and 2.5-4.1%
    under RCP8.5.  In the long term (2061-2080), TFP decrease by 4.4-11.8% under the
    HadGEM2-ES model and by 3.9-8.1% under the NorESM1-M model. Yield reductions are
    roughly twice as large as TFP declines. Climate adaptation offsets 38.1% of TFP
    reductions in the midterm and 28.2% in the long term.
  12: "Extreme hot weather (additional one-day cumulative exposure to temperatures\
    \ above 33\xB0C) is associated with a 2.6% linear decrease in agricultural TFP\
    \ and a 4.4% linear decrease in yield in the short run."
  13: "Adaptation behaviors in TFP and inputs jointly and significantly offset the\
    \ short-run effects in yield by 46.8% (95% CI, 30.2%\u201358.0%)."
  14: "Table A1 provides quantitative estimates of the impact of GDD above and below\
    \ temperature thresholds (ranging from 25\xB0C to 40\xB0C) on log agricultural\
    \ TFP. The coefficients represent the estimated change in log agricultural TFP\
    \ for each additional GDD. The table also includes R-squared values for each regression."

    \ and Yield, along with associated percentiles (5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 95%)."
