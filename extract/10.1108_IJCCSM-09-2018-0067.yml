Drivers of Risk:
  2: Droughts, increasing temperature and reducing rainfall trends
  3: Global climate change and local changes in vegetation cover are causing rainfall
    reduction and water scarcity.
  7: Water availability for human consumption and economic activities in the semi-arid
    region of Brazil.
  8: Lower rainfall periods affecting hydroelectric generation.
  9: High cost of PV systems (historically).
  10: "Price drop for PV panels in the international market; Reductions in Brazil\u2019\
    s Central Bank basic interest rate \u2013 SELIC (from 14 to 6.5 per cent during\
    \ the last couple of years), lowering \uFB01nancing costs."
  11: Large availability of degraded land in the Brazilian Northeast Semiarid region
    suitable for PV generation.
  12: Droughts reducing subsistence corn and bean cultures.
  15: Recurrent droughts impacting maize farmers. Centralized energy production impacting
    geopolitical power. Semi-arid climate and ongoing climate changes.
Drivers_of_Risk:
  13: Season-dependent variability in agriculture, comparing consistent daily PV generation
    to once-a-year rainfall-dependent maize harvest.
Highlights:
  2: Exploiting Northeast Brazil's abundant solar resource for distributed photovoltaic
    generation is presented as a novel approach to climate change adaptation and socioeconomic
    development, particularly at the small farmer level.
  3: Persistent water crises have exacerbated conflicts between different water use
    stakeholders.
  7: Rainwater collected from PV panels can meet consumption needs of a family of
    five or be used for agriculture in semi-arid regions.
  8: PV energy presents itself as a good option complementing hydroelectric generation
    in Brazil, especially during periods of lower rainfall, potentially allowing for
    the management of reservoirs.
  9: Brazil presents ideal conditions for the use of solar energy due to high annual
    average levels of global solar irradiation.
  10: PV electricity generation costs in Brazil have sharply reduced due to international
    price drops and reductions in the central bank's interest rate. PV electricity
    is cheaper than hydroelectricity and thermal biomass.
  11: Active scenario includes economic benefits from self-sustained food production
    using PV electricity.
  12: Distributed PV generation can provide a sustained income stream to vulnerable
    small farmer families, potentially exceeding government conditional cash transfer
    programs.
  13: PV energy generation illustrates high economic potential and provides gradual,
    distributed employment opportunities compared to hydroelectric power.
  15: PV energy potential in the Brazilian Northeast can become a perennial source
    of income for a wide range of the historically excluded population. Use of PV
    panels for rainwater collection and shading can increase resilience to the climate
    and ongoing climate changes.

    productivity values and similar service rates; estimation focuses on output values
    per unit area.
More Notes:
  2: The paper criticizes traditional drought relief efforts focused on water provision
    as largely ineffective and suggests a shift towards solar energy-based solutions.
  3: The paper discusses the competition for water resources between irrigation and
    hydroelectric power generation, where power generation prevails, causing losses
    to farmers and river-siders and hampering food supply to urban agglomerations.
  8: The analysis compares the potential of PV generation in degraded areas and desertified
    areas of the Northeast of Brazil (NEB) with Brazil's overall hydroelectric potential,
    normalized by 2017 national electricity consumption.
  9: The degraded areas in Brazil provide an excellent opportunity for the implementation
    of distributed PV micro power plants.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: The proposed smart grid photovoltaic generation program increases the country's
    resiliency to the effect of droughts and climate change; the program allows for
    the reversion of a pattern of long term poverty in semi-arid Northeast Brazil;
    exploitation of semiaridity with abundant solar radiation provides adaptation
    to unforeseen drought events; the program is a developmental and socioeconomic
    inclusion mechanism
  3: No relevant information
  8: Potential effects on electric power concessionaires through the postponement
    of investments in new power plants.

    plants.
  10: The payoff time for PV plant initial investments, considering current interest
    rates of 4% per year practiced by official Banks in Brazil for PV installations,
    would be approximately 7 years. Gross annual revenues of energy generation alone
    (without considering transmission costs and taxes) by the PV plants depicted in
    Table II correspond to 2.74 times the interest that would be earned in the financial
    market given the prevailing interest rate of 6.5 per cent per year.

    mitigating extreme poverty, especially during droughts.

    200 m2 panels to 4,000-12,000 m3/year for 1 ha of panels.
  8: The volume of water used for hydroelectric generation is 1.8 m3/s/MW. Energy
    generation from one hectare of PV panels uses approximately 120 m3 of water per
    year. PV potential of degraded pasture areas (1,600,000 ha) amounts to 4.90 PWh/year,
    9.3 times the 2017 national electricity consumption. The national hydroelectric
    potential is 2.3 PWh/year, or 4.4 times the 2017 national consumption.
  9: Annual average levels of global solar irradiation in Brazil range between 1,500
    and 2,500 kWh/m2.
  10: "PV at Brazil\u2019s R$0.118 (US$0.0358)/kWh, while hydroelectricity and thermal\
    \ biomass were priced above R$0.198 (US$0.0604)/kWh in Brazil's April 2018 Generation\
    \ Auction A-4/2018.  PV system cost is US$2.67/Wp.  Average marketed energy value\
    \ (i.e. US$0.071/kWh) is used to calculate payoff time. Official bank interest\
    \ rates for PV installations in Brazil is 4% per year.  Prevailing financial market\
    \ interest rate is 6.5% per year. Degraded planted pasture and deserti\uFB01ed\
    \ land of the NEB encompass nearly 1.9 million ha."

    \ from PV energy sales; Average Bolsa Fam\xEDlia cash transfer is US$25.00 per\
    \ family per month; Potential savings of US$11,000, $55,000 and $550,000 per year\
    \ if PV energy from different sized plants is utilized in house; Annual revenue\
    \ from a 1 hectare PV plant is US$219,000 for energy, US$140,160 for taxes, and\
    \ US$192,720 for distribution and transmission costs for a total of US$551,880."

    unit area compared to maize, considering a year of regular rainfall.
