Drivers of Risk:
  1: Persistence of climate change-induced GDP shocks.
  2: Climate change impacts expressed as shocks to GDP; Extreme events; Poverty traps.
  3: Climate change impacts affecting productivity and growth through persistent shocks.
  4: Presence of structural changes such as the oil price shock of 1973, the 1980s
    debt crisis, and the disintegration of the USSR in the 1990s impacting GDP series.
  5: Climate change (specifically temperature increase over the 1900 level, Tt); Impacts
    of sea level rise.
  6: Increases in global equilibrium temperature, climate change impacts.
  7: Climate change impacts under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios, with
    varying levels of persistence (parameter 'a').
  8: Direct impacts of climate change, which are new shocks in a given year, and indirect
    impacts, which are aftershocks from past shocks, represented as persistence in
    shocks to economic growth.
  9: Climate change impacts under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios and for
    different values of parameter a.
  10: Climate change impacts treated as direct shocks to GDP; General shocks to output;
    Climate shocks; Persistence of shocks
Highlights:
  1: Climate change impacts could lead to larger GDP losses than previously estimated
    due to the persistence of shocks.
  2: The paper investigates the sensitivity of IAMs to the persistence of impacts
    and proposes a modification to make the impact dynamics explicit in the damage
    functions.
  3: Ignoring the persistence of climate change impacts could lead to underestimation
    of their economic costs, with the study highlighting significant sensitivity of
    climate impacts' costs to persistence levels.
  4: Shocks may have a permanent effect on GDP, with significant discrepancies in
    persistence when structural breaks are considered.
  6: The persistence of climate change impacts significantly affects the magnitude
    of economic impacts, with higher persistence leading to substantially larger impacts
    on GDP. The paper argues that DICE and PAGE models underestimate these impacts
    due to their low persistence.
  7: The tables show the impact on various regions' economies given different assumptions
    of future climate change and economic persistence.
  8: Estimates of economic impacts of climate change are highly sensitive to the persistence
    parameter a; without persistence, present value of impacts is 30-48% of 2001 GDP,
    while considering persistence makes impacts several times larger.
  9: The lack of persistence in climate shocks in IAMs is an implicit assumption that
    needs to be spelled out. Some level of persistence is expected from climate change
    impacts.
  10: "The estimates of the costs of climate change are very sensitive to the inclusion\
    \ of a \u201Cmemory parameter\u201D. For values of persistence ranging from moderate\
    \ to high, the estimates of the present value of the costs of climate change can\
    \ be dramatically different with respect to the estimates that are produced ignoring\
    \ the persistence of shocks."
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of the persistence of generic shocks in observed GDP series across different
    world regions.
  2: Investigates the sensitivity of IAMs to the persistence of impacts by modifying
    damage functions; Analyzes the temporal dynamics of processes or systems by studying
    how single shocks propagate through time using impulse response functions.
  3: The analysis uses an empirical approach focusing on the econometrics of GDP shock
    persistence, applying unit root tests and sensitivity analysis in IAMs like DICE/RICE,
    FUND, and PAGE2002.
  4: The analysis employs unit root tests and structural break assessments to evaluate
    persistence in GDP series. It uses Autoregressive models (AR(1)) to represent
    the dynamics of GDP shocks.
  5: Uses the DICE model, which includes a damage function based on temperature increase
    (Tt) and parameters q1 and q2. Output (Qt) is determined by a Solow growth model
    with a Cobb-Douglas production function. Total factor productivity (At) and population
    (Lt) are modeled with exponential growth functions and geometrically declining
    growth rates. The speed of convergence to steady state for the Solow model with
    a Cobb-Douglas production function is shown. Dynamics in growth model include
    equilibrium and disequilibrium.
  6: The paper analyzes Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) such as DICE/RICE and
    PAGE and extends their impact functions to include the persistence of shocks.
    The analysis considers both equilibrium and disequilibrium dynamics. A generic
    impact function (I = w1*T + w2*T^2)*Y is used, where I is the economic impact,
    T is the temperature increment, and Y is output.
  7: The impact function includes a persistence parameter 'a', representing the memory
    of the system (how much past impacts affect current impacts).
  8: The study uses a simple impact function following the PAGE2002 model, simulating
    annual GDP growth impacts with a memory function for persistence of shocks over
    5000 realizations and a time-step of one year.
  9: Economic Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) model climate change impacts as
    an aggregated direct shock to baseline GDP.
  10: The analysis uses a 'memory parameter' to represent the persistence of shocks,
    with values ranging from moderate to high, similar to those of general shocks
    to GDP. Regionally differentiated values are also used, based on the sum of autoregressive
    coefficients estimated from regional observed GDP series.
More Notes:
  2: The paper focuses on analyzing the dynamics of the damage functions within IAMs
    rather than the persistence imparted by the climate system itself.
  5: The impact module of DICE has zero persistence as any shock at time t has no
    impact at time t + s for s > 0; The model dynamics impart a certain level of persistence
    to shocks in GDP.
  6: The paper criticizes the assumption in DICE and PAGE that human and natural systems
    have costless and effective reactive adaptation capacity.
  7: Values in parentheses in the tables give the 5% and 95% percentiles of the estimated
    impacts.
  9: The 'zero persistence' implied by some IAMs can be interpreted as autonomous,
    extremely large and effective, costless reactive adaptation and limitless resilience
    capacities.
  10: Including the persistence of shocks can lead to more realistic estimates of
    the cost/benefits and risks of climate change and points out that regional differences
    may be larger than previously estimated.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Potential economic costs of climate change due to persistence of shocks in GDP.
  2: GDP as a measure of global/regional welfare; Economic growth.
  3: The paper investigates the sensitivity of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs)
    estimates of climate change costs to different levels of persistence, showing
    costs considerably larger than those implied by zero persistence.
  4: Estimates of persistence in GDP series and how shocks may have permanent effects,
    potentially leading to larger long-run responses.
  5: Impacts of sea level rise have a permanent effect on GDP level; Climate change
    damages affect output; climate change damages include agriculture, sea level rise,
    other market sectors, human health, nonmarket amenity impacts, human settlements
    and ecosystems, and catastrophes.
  6: Economic impacts represented as a percent change in GDP.
  7: Present value of economic impacts of climate change over this century, expressed
    as multiples of GDP in year 2001.
  8: The net present value of the impacts of climate change over 100 years ranges
    from 1.28% to 12.49% of initial GDP with a mean of 5.73% if the persistence parameter
    a = 0, and increases to a mean of 11.01% with a range of 2.44% to 24.00% of GDP
    if a = 0.5.
  9: Impacts as percent of GDP
  10: Economic impacts of climate change; costs of climate change; cost/benefits of
    climate change; risks of climate change
Quantitative material:
  3: Tables and figures provide data such as GDP time series, CIR values, and persistence
    estimates across regions.
  4: CIR values range from 1.85 to 23.81, with a mean of 5.87, indicating the potential
    long-run accumulated response of a unit GDP shock.
  6: Table 1 presents the present value of total climate change economic impacts over
    a century as a percentage of GDP in year one for different persistence (a) values
    (0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.8, 0.9, and 1). For example, with a=0, the mean impact is 5.73%
    of GDP. With a=1, the mean impact rises to 90.85% of GDP.
  7: Table 2 provides estimates of economic impacts under RCP4.5 for various regions
    (Europe, Latin America, South Asia, North Asia, North America, Africa, China,
    World) and persistence values (a = 0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.8, 0.9, 1). Table 3 provides
    estimates of economic impacts under RCP8.5 for the same regions and persistence
    values.
  8: Yes, the paper provides quantitative estimates of the losses in GDP as a percentage
    for different values of the persistence parameter a, and net present value percentages
    of GDP for total impacts over 100 years.

    mean, 5th, and 95th percentiles. Fig. 3 shows estimates of global and regional
    climate change impacts under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios and for
    different values of a.
