Drivers of Risk:
  1: Deviations of temperature and precipitation from their long-term moving average
    historical norms; Persistent changes in temperature above or below its historical
    norm; Country-specific variability of climate conditions.
  2: Deviations of temperature and precipitation from their long-term moving-average
    historical norms (climate).
  3: Annual increases in temperatures, country-specific variability of climate conditions,
    pace with which temperatures increase, historical variability of climate conditions.
  4: Increases in temperature, precipitation relative to historical norms.
  5: The drivers of risk are annual increases or decreases in temperature above or
    below the historical norm and deviations of precipitation from historical norms.
  6: Temperature and precipitation relative to their historical norms
  8: Persistent increases in annual temperatures above their norms (or thresholds)
  9: Impact is driven by temperature changes relative to historical norms.
  10: Temperature increases, degree of climate variability.
  11: Annual increases in temperatures under mitigated and unmitigated scenarios
  12: Impacts assessed based on persistent increases in temperatures under RCP 2.6
    and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Long-term impact of climate change on economic activity across countries, specifically
    per-capita real output growth.
  2: Long-term macroeconomic effects of weather patterns transformed by climate change
    on 174 countries, specifically per capita real output growth.
  3: World's real GDP per capita.
  4: GDP impact of increases in temperature and GDP per capita losses from increases
    in temperature.
  5: This paper evaluates the impact of temperature and precipitation deviations from
    historical norms on GDP per capita growth.
  6: Long-run effects of climate change on per capita real GDP growth
  8: Long-run effects of climate change on per capita real GDP growth
  9: "The paper evaluates the long-run effects of climate change on per capita real\
    \ GDP growth from 1960\u20132014 across various groups of countries."
  10: Effects of climate change on per capita real GDP growth.
  11: Percent Loss in GDP per capita by 2100
  12: Assesses percent loss in GDP per capita under different climate scenarios and
    timelines.
Highlights:
  1: Per-capita real output growth is adversely affected by persistent changes in
    the temperature above or below its historical norm; The marginal effects of temperature
    shocks vary across climates and income groups.
  2: Series of positive or negative weather shocks has a long-term negative effect
    on per capita GDP growth.
  3: "An increase in average global temperature of 0.04 \u25E6C per year reduces world\u2019\
    s real GDP per capita by 7.22 percent by 2100."
  4: "Analysis accounts for potential asymmetrical effects of climate change on growth\
    \ around the threshold. Argues against including temperature levels and squares\
    \ in the regression due to introduced trends. The panel ARDL approach is valid\
    \ regardless of whether the underlying variables are \U0001D43C(0) or \U0001D43C\
    (1); and it is robust to omitted variables bias and bi-directional feedback effects."
  5: Persistent deviations of temperature above or below its historical norm have
    negative effects on long-run economic growth. Deviations of precipitation from
    historical norms are not statistically significant.
  6: Increases in temperature relative to historical norms are associated with statistically
    significant reductions in per capita real GDP growth. Results suggest that adaptation
    efforts might not be keeping pace with climate change, and adaptation may be concentrated
    in specific countries or sectors.
  8: Persistent temperature deviations from historical norms have a negative effect
    on long-run per capita GDP growth; negative growth effects of weather shocks are
    less severe in cold climates; poor countries are disproportionately affected by
    weather shocks.
  9: Rich countries and areas with temperate or hot climates appear to experience
    a greater impact on GDP growth rates due to climate changes.
  10: Economic growth is affected not only by higher temperatures but also by the
    degree of climate variability.
  11: Adaptation to climate change is unlikely to fully offset negative long-run growth
    effects.
  12: Projects significant GDP per capita loss for the US, especially under the RCP
    8.5 scenario by 2100.
Methodology:
  1: Uses a stochastic growth model where productivity is affected by deviations of
    temperature and precipitation from their long-term moving average historical norms;
    Panel data set of 174 countries over the years 1960 to 2014; Counterfactual analysis.
  2: Uses a theoretical growth model linking deviations of temperature and precipitation
    from historical norms to per capita real output growth over the period 1960-2014.
    Employs a half-panel Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE) estimator to address potential bias
    and size distortion in FE estimators due to weak exogeneity of climate variables.
  3: "Panel regressions using annual population-weighted climate data and real GDP\
    \ per capita between 1900 and 2014; Counterfactual exercises investigate the cumulative\
    \ income effects of annual increases in temperatures over the period 2015\u2013\
    2100."
  4: "Panel ARDL model is used: \U0001D6E5\U0001D466\U0001D456\U0001D461= \U0001D44E\
    \U0001D456+ \u2211(\U0001D711\U0001D4C1\U0001D6E5\U0001D466\U0001D456,\U0001D461\
    \u2212\U0001D4C1) + \u2211(\U0001D737 \U0001D4C1\U0001D6E5\u0303\U0001D431\U0001D456\
    ,\U0001D461\u2212\U0001D4C1(\U0001D45A))+ \U0001D700\U0001D456\U0001D461. Historical\
    \ norms are computed using moving averages with m=20 and 40. The (average) long-run\
    \ effects,  \U0001D703, are calculated from the OLS estimates of the short-run\
    \ coefficients in Eq. (1): \U0001D73D  = \U0001D719\u22121 \u2211\U0001D6FD\U0001D4C1\
    , where  \U0001D719= 1\u2212  \u2211\U0001D711\U0001D4C1. Results are applicable\
    \ to panel data of 174 countries from 1960-2014."
  5: The analysis uses a panel ARDL regression with fixed effects and half-panel Jackknife
    FE (HPJ-FE) estimator. The lag order is set to 4. Climate norms are constructed
    as moving averages of the past 20, 30, and 40 years.
  6: Uses fixed effects (FE) and half-panel Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE) regressions on panel
    data from 1960-2014. Historical norms for temperature and precipitation are calculated
    as moving averages over preceding m years (m=20, 30, 40). Analyzes the impact
    of deviations from these norms on per capita real GDP growth.
  8: "Counterfactual analysis using HPJ-FE estimates based on an ARDL specification\
    \ to measure the cumulative output per capita effects of persistent temperature\
    \ increases from 2015\u20132100 under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, compared\
    \ to a historical trend baseline (1960-2014)."
  9: Analysis performed using the half-panel Jackknife mean-group estimator with temperature
    relative to historical norms as a key variable.
  10: Estimates are based on a regression model (equation provided) using half-panel
    Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE) procedure with data from 174 countries over the period 1960-2014.
    Temperature norm is based on moving averages of the past 30 years.
  11: "Counterfactual exercises investigating output effects of annual increases in\
    \ temperatures under mitigated and unmitigated scenarios during 2015\u20132100,\
    \ using a panel data approach that allows for asymmetric weather effects, nonlinearity\
    \ and an implicit model of adaptation, and deals with temperature being trended"
  12: Analysis uses RCP scenarios and PPP GDP weighted averages for different years.
More Notes:
  1: Does not obtain any statistically significant effects for changes in precipitation.
  3: Cold countries are also affected by climate change because temperatures are rising
    faster in these regions; Adaptation to climate change can reduce negative long-run
    growth effects, but is unlikely to offset them entirely.
  4: Uses population-weighted average temperature and precipitation. Considers temperature
    and precipitation relative to their historical norms.
  5: The HPJ-FE estimates are preferred due to bias correction. The paper explores
    asymmetry in the effects of positive and negative temperature deviations but finds
    little evidence of it.
  6: The paper considers both positive and negative deviations from temperature and
    precipitation norms, and also the absolute value of the deviations, to capture
    non-linear effects.
  11: Figures 6 and 7 show the percent loss in GDP per capita in 2100 under RCP 8.5
    and RCP 2.6 scenarios, respectively, using m=30 in Eq. (13).
Quantitative material:
  1: "A persistent increase in average global temperature by 0.04 \xB0C per year reduces\
    \ world real GDP per capita by more than 7 percent by 2100; Limiting the temperature\
    \ increase to 0.01 \xB0C per annum reduces the loss substantially to about 1 percent;\
    \ Losses would increase to 13 percent globally if country-specific variability\
    \ of climate conditions were to rise commensurate with annual temperature increases\
    \ of 0.04 \xB0C."
  2: The study models changes in the distribution of weather patterns (averages and
    variability).
  3: "If temperature rises (falls) above (below) its historical norm by 0.01 \u25E6\
    C annually for a long period of time, income growth will be lower by 0.0543 percentage\
    \ points per year; Under RCP 8.5 scenario world\u2019s real GDP per capita reduces\
    \ by 7.22 percent by 2100; Losses under the RCP 8.5 scenario would almost double\
    \ (to 13.11 percent globally by 2100) if country-specific variability of climate\
    \ conditions were to rise commensurate to temperature increases; Limiting the\
    \ increase to 0.01 \u25E6C per annum reduces the output loss substantially to\
    \ 1.07 percent; For the U.S. the losses are relatively large at 10.52 percent\
    \ under the RCP 8.5 scenario in year 2100."
  4: Projected GDP per capita losses based on m=20 and m=40; GDP per capita losses
    by 2100 for hot and cold countries.
  5: "A 0.01 \xB0C annual increase in temperature above its historical norm reduces\
    \ real GDP per capita growth by 0.0577 percentage points per year. A 0.01 \xB0\
    C annual decrease in temperature below its historical norm reduces real GDP per\
    \ capita growth by 0.0505 percentage points per year."

    temperature and precipitation, reporting coefficients with standard errors and
    significance levels (***, **, *) for various specifications and time horizons
    (m=20, 30, 40). The coefficients are negative for temperature, suggesting negative
    impacts on GDP growth. Table 2: Long-run effects on per capita real GDP growth

  10: Increased climate variability almost doubles GDP per capita losses at the global
    level by 2100 to 13.11 percent under RCP 8.5 with m=30.
  11: Estimated global per capita GDP losses under a high-emissions scenario with
    no policy action (RCP8.5) would almost double if country-specific climate variability
    were to rise commensurate to temperature increases, amounting to 13 percent by
    2100.
