Drivers of Risk:
  1: Persistent changes in temperature above or below its historical norm, country-specific
    variability of climate conditions.
  2: Deviations of temperature and precipitation from their long-term moving-average
    historical norms (climate change shifting average weather patterns); weather shocks
    (positive or negative).
  3: Annual increases in global temperatures, country-specific variability of climate
    conditions.
  4: Increases in temperature relative to historical norms.
  5: Deviations of temperature from its historical norm (both above and below)
  6: Changes in temperature and precipitation relative to historical norms
  8: Persistent increases in annual temperatures above their norms, weather shocks,
    changes in trend temperature, and country-specific average annual increases in
    temperatures.
  9: "Temperature shocks (\U0001D463\U0001D447\U0001D456,\U0001D447+\U0001D457) and\
    \ changes in trend temperature (\U0001D44F1\U0001D447\U0001D456,\U0001D457) relative\
    \ to the historical trend (\U0001D44F0\U0001D447\U0001D456)."
  10: Increase in global average temperature and climate variability affects GDP per
    capita losses.
  11: Annual increases in temperature, deviation of temperature from historical norms,
    climate variability
  12: Persistent increases in temperatures based on the RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios
Highlights:
  1: Per-capita real output growth is adversely affected by persistent changes in
    the temperature above or below its historical norm, but no statistically significant
    effects for changes in precipitation.
  2: Weather shocks have a long-term negative effect on per capita GDP growth.
  3: Persistent temperature increases negatively impact economic growth in both poor
    and rich countries; climate variability amplifies the negative impact of temperature
    increases; adaptation can reduce but not eliminate these negative effects.
  4: Some countries are more adversely affected in terms of GDP loss with temperature
    increases compared to others.
  5: Permanent deviations of precipitation from their historical norms do not affect
    long-term growth.
  6: Climate change, as measured by deviations in temperature and precipitation from
    historical norms, has a statistically significant negative impact on per capita
    real GDP growth. The HPJ-FE estimates, which correct for bias, generally show
    a larger negative impact than the FE estimates.
  7: The paper hypothesizes that the adverse long-run growth effects of weather shocks
    are driven by poor countries.
  8: Persistent temperature deviations from historical norms have a negative effect
    on long-run per capita GDP growth. Negative growth effects of weather shocks are
    less severe in cold climates than in hot climates. Both poor and rich countries
    are affected by weather shocks.
  9: "The parameter \u0302\U0001D703\U0001D6E5|\u0303\U0001D447\U0001D456\U0001D461\
    (\U0001D45A)| represents the estimated impact of climate change on per capita\
    \ real GDP growth."
  10: Significant GDP per capita losses are projected without mitigation policies,
    which vary by country and scenario.
  11: Persistent temperature changes above norms negatively impact economic growth;
    GDP losses vary significantly across countries depending on temperature increases
    and climate variability; adaptation is unlikely to fully offset negative long-run
    growth effects.
  12: Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the percent loss in GDP per capita in 2100 with
    m=30 could reach 7.22% for the world, 4.35% for China, 4.66% for the European
    Union, 9.90% for India, 8.93% for Russia and 10.52% for the United States. Incorporating
    climate variability, the percent loss in GDP per capita in 2100 under RCP 8.5
    could reach 13.11% for the World, 5.02% for China, 9.37% for the European Union,
    16.92% for India, 12.94% for Russia and 17.19% for the United States.
Methodology:
  1: Uses a stochastic growth model where productivity is affected by deviations of
    temperature and precipitation from their long-term moving average historical norms;
    panel data set of 174 countries over the years 1960 to 2014; counterfactual analysis
  2: Develops a theoretical growth model linking weather deviations from historical
    norms to per capita real output growth; Employs panel data models; Uses half-panel
    Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE) estimator to address bias from weakly exogenous regressors.
  3: Panel regressions using annual population-weighted climate data and real GDP
    per capita from 1900-2014; counterfactual exercises investigating the cumulative
    income effects of annual increases in temperatures from 2015-2100.
  4: Panel ARDL model with country-specific fixed effects, using temperature and precipitation
    deviations from historical norms as key variables. Climate norms computed using
    30-year moving averages, with robustness checks using 20- and 40-year moving averages.
    ARDL approach used to address issues of endogeneity and omitted variable bias.
  5: Panel ARDL regression with fixed effects (FE) and half-panel Jackknife FE (HPJ-FE)
    estimator to address bias. Climate norms are constructed as moving averages of
    the past 20, 30, and 40 years.
  6: The analysis uses a panel data regression model with country fixed effects (FE)
    and half-panel Jackknife fixed effects (HPJ-FE) to estimate the long-run effects
    of climate change on per capita real GDP growth from 1960-2014. The model incorporates
    temperature and precipitation deviations from historical norms. Long-run effects
    are calculated from short-run coefficients. The standard errors are estimated
    using the estimator proposed in Proposition 4 of Chudik et al. (2018).
  7: The paper uses ARDL specification to estimate long-run effects of temperature
    increases. It also employs a half-panel Jackknife Mean Group (HPJ-MG) estimator,
    allowing for marginal effects of weather shocks to vary across countries.
  8: The paper uses a counterfactual analysis based on HPJ-FE estimates from an ARDL
    specification to measure the cumulative output per capita effects of persistent
    temperature increases. They compare output trajectories under different temperature
    scenarios (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) with a baseline of historical temperature trends
    (1960-2014).

  10: The analysis uses data from 1960-2014 using a half-panel Jackknife FE estimation
    and assumes different RCP scenarios.
  11: Panel data analysis with asymmetric weather effects, allowing for nonlinearity
    and implicit adaptation; counterfactual exercises under mitigated (RCP 2.6) and
    unmitigated (RCP 8.5) scenarios from 2015-2100
  12: The analysis uses PPP GDP weighted averages to calculate the percent loss in
    GDP per capita. The results are applicable for the years 2030, 2050, and 2100
    under the specified RCP scenarios.
More Notes:
  1: Marginal effects of temperature shocks vary across climates and income groups.
  2: The paper focuses on 'deviations' from historical norms rather than absolute
    temperature levels. The paper tests for level or growth effects of weather shocks.
    The paper uses half-panel Jackknife FE to account for bidirectional feedback effects
    between growth and climate change
  3: The pace with which historical norms change impacts the size of income losses.
  4: The model accounts for asymmetrical effects of climate change, separating temperature
    and precipitation deviations into positive and negative values.
  7: The paper investigates whether temperature increases affect hotter countries
    more than colder ones.
  8: "The analysis controls for lagged world output growth to account for unobserved\
    \ global factors and weakly correlated errors across countries. The impact of\
    \ climate change clearly depends on the magnitude of \U0001D4651\U0001D456,\U0001D447\
    +\U0001D457\u2212\U0001D4650\U0001D456,\U0001D447+\U0001D457, or the changes in\
    \ temperature."
  9: Asterisks in Table 4 indicate statistical significance at the 1% (***), 5% (**),
    and 10% (*) levels.
  11: Cold/rich countries have lower marginal weather effects; even cold climates
    can experience sizable income losses due to faster warming or increased climate
    variability.

  11: GDP per capita loss
  12: Percent loss in GDP per capita
Quantitative material:
  1: "A persistent increase in average global temperature by 0.04\xB0C per year reduces\
    \ world real GDP per capita by more than 7 percent by 2100; limiting the temperature\
    \ increase to 0.01\xB0C per annum reduces the loss substantially to about 1 percent;\
    \ losses would increase to 13 percent globally if country-specific variability\
    \ of climate conditions were to rise commensurate with annual temperature increases\
    \ of 0.04\xB0C."
  2: Estimates weather effects in panel data studies across 174 countries from 1960-2014.
    Estimates that some previous GDP projections were unrealistic because they used
    a common climate threshold across countries.
  3: "A 0.01\xB0C annual temperature increase reduces income growth by 0.0543 percentage\
    \ points per year; an increase in average global temperature of 0.04\xB0C per\
    \ year (RCP 8.5) reduces world's real GDP per capita by 7.22 percent by 2100;\
    \ with increased climate variability, the loss under RCP 8.5 doubles to 13.11\
    \ percent by 2100; limiting the increase to 0.01\xB0C per annum (Paris Agreement)\
    \ reduces output loss to 1.07 percent by 2100; For the U.S., the GDP per capita\
    \ loss under RCP 8.5 by 2100 is 10.52 percent."
  4: Projected GDP impact is for some future year, typically 2100.
  5: "A persistent 0.01 \u25E6C increase in the temperature above its historical norm\
    \ reduces real GDP per capita growth by 0.0586 percentage points per annum in\
    \ the long run. A 0.01 \u25E6C annual decrease in the temperature below its historical\
    \ norm reduces real GDP per capita growth by 0.0520 percentage points per year."
  6: Table 1 and Table 2 provide quantitative estimates of the long-run effects of
    climate change (temperature and precipitation deviations) on per capita real GDP
    growth from 1960-2014, with various specifications and estimation techniques.
    The coefficients are generally negative, implying a negative impact on GDP growth.
    The magnitude of the coefficients varies depending on the specification (m=20,
    30, 40), the estimation method (FE, HPJ-FE), and whether precipitation is included
    in the model.
  7: The paper presents Figure 4, which shows rolling estimates of the long-run effects
    (and their 95% standard error bands) of temperature increases on per capita real
    GDP growth over different time windows.

    \ of climate variables from their historical norm and per capita real GDP growth,\

    \ analysis calculates the cumulative output per capita effects of persistent temperature\
    \ increases from 2015-2100 under different RCP scenarios. For example, a counterfactual\
    \ analysis found that for cold countries the 95% range estimates can be calculated\
    \ as \u22120.64 to \u22120.05, and for hot countries as \u22121.91 to \u22120.45."

  10: GDP per capita losses are quantified for the years 2030, 2050, and 2100 with
    different RCP scenarios.
  11: "A temperature deviation of 0.01 \u25E6C annually from its historical norm lowers\
    \ long-term income growth by 0.0543 percentage points per year; abiding by the\

  12: Table 6 provides percent loss in GDP per capita by 2030, 2050, and 2100 under
    the RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios for the World, China, European Union, India,
    Russia, and the United States, with different 'm' values (20, 30, and 40). Table
