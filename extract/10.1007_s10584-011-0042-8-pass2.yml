Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change is expected to further stress freshwater resources and widen the
    gap between the demand for and supply of water in China.
  3: Increased heavy precipitation events, increased drought, changes in surface water
    supplies, sea level rise, wildfire, coral reef degradation, ecosystem degradation.
  17: Reduced precipitation and landscape changes due to human activities, with reduced
    precipitation being the main driver of decreased water resources in northern China.
  19: Climate change and the alteration of rainfall and temperature regimes can affect
    hydropower generation.
  24: Water pollution caused by industrial, municipal wastewater, and agricultural
    activities.
  27: Natural water shortage, widespread water pollution, and climate change are stressors
    on freshwater resources.
Highlights:
  1: China should develop a sustainable water resources management strategy based
    on both supply- and demand-side management options to make the limited water supplies
    meet the demands of economic development, social well-being and the conservation
    of ecosystems in the context of global climate change.
  17: Significant decrease in water resources in northern China, especially in the
    Yellow, Hai, and Liao river basins, with major decreases in precipitation, runoff,
    and total water resources.
  19: Demand management and water pollution control are key for adaptation to climate
    change in China's water resources management.
  24: Water pollution is one of the most serious environmental issues in China, affecting
    human health and ecosystems.
  27: Current water resources management in China is largely supply-driven and struggles
    to meet increasing demands while protecting the environment; a shift to demand
    management is crucial for sustainable water resource management and adaptation
    to climate change.
Methodology:
  1: The paper presents a historical perspective on water resources management policies
    and practices in China and recommends demand management and pollution control
    as key measures for improving water resources management to adapt to climate change.
  19: Discussion of necessary policy and institutional changes to incorporate climate
    change into water resources planning and to implement Integrated Water Resources
    Management (IWRM).
  24: Discusses policy approaches such as regulatory and economic instruments for
    controlling water pollution.
  27: The paper analyzes the current socio-economic and water resources conditions
    in China and suggests a strategy of demand management and pollution control to
    adapt to climate change.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on water resource management in China as an adaptation strategy
    to climate change, but it does not explicitly quantify macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    impacts or the costs and benefits of adaptation in monetary terms.
  3: The table appears to categorize climate change phenomena and their resulting
    impacts across different sectors. The leftmost column headings contain typos and
    abbreviations.
  17: Technological progress, such as improved agricultural practices, may help mitigate
    the impacts of climate change on water resources and agriculture in China.
  19: Increased water transfer and water treatment activities will require more energy.
  24: The page discusses the need for improved environmental monitoring, public participation,
    and coordination among governmental bodies.
No relevant information:
  12: This page primarily discusses water resource management in China under different
    economic systems and does not contain information on macroeconomic/fiscal risks
    of climate change or the costs/benefits of adaptation.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  3: Loss of hydropower generation, loss of agricultural capacity/crops/livestock
    yields, increased water scarcity, damage to infrastructure, impacts on logging/insurers/private
    migration, property damage.
  19: Hydropower generation (15% of China's electricity) can be affected by rainfall
    and temperature regimes.
  24: No relevant information
  27: Further development and sustainability of China are constrained by water shortage
    and pollution; climate change widens the gap between water demand and supply.
Quantitative material:
  1: No relevant information
  3: 'Projected overall likelihood of changes. Relative assessment of direction and
    magnitude of change: ''Increased'', ''Lower'', etc. for different outcomes.'
  24: Government investment of 35.6 billion Yuan on water pollution control between
    2008 and 2020.
