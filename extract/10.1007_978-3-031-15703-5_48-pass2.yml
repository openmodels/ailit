  122: "Transformation of agrifood systems will have macroeconomic implications (employment,\
    \ income, cost of living, \uFB01scal consequences) and economy-wide trade-offs."
  134: Assessment of systemic risk, considering complex interactions and variance/covariance
    profiles, is a key focus.
  135: Achieving the end of widespread hunger requires significant resources, but
    the cost is manageable, and represents 8% of the size of food markets.
  137: Using safety nets alone to ensure healthy diets is too expensive; combining
    with other interventions lowers the cost.
  138: No single intervention can achieve the end of malnourishment; synergies are
    needed. The analysis considers household food security, cost-effectiveness, and
    heterogeneous environmental trade-offs.
  139: A "Full package" of interventions has the highest impact on improving access
    to healthy diets, approaching 600 million people, with contributions from all
    regions. Safety Nets for Healthy Diets is the largest component of global annual
    spendings in 2030; School Feeding Programs is the second largest. The Americas
    accounts for the largest proportion of spending by continent.
  141: Ending chronic hunger by 2030 is possible with key structural interventions
    to ramp up agrifood systems' efficiency. Interventions can create synergies that
    address different causes of hunger and minimize total intervention costs. Reducing
    food loss and waste has positive effects across all trade-offs.
  142: Investing in interventions can reduce the cost of safety nets needed to provide
    healthy diets to 3 billion people by two-thirds, saving $428 billion globally
    by 2030.
  144: The paper explores the trade-offs between different policy objectives (e.g.,
    food production vs. environmental sustainability) and aims to find the optimal
    allocation of resources to achieve multiple goals simultaneously.

    across regions (Kasai, Kasai-Central, Kwilu) and years (1992, 2001, 2005, 2015)
  151: Effective poverty and inequality eradication requires boosting the opportunities
    and capacities of the poor and vulnerable through equitable redistribution of
    resources, quality education, progressive taxation, and state infrastructure investments;
    Reducing inequalities requires assessing gains in productivity, production and
    income against their positive impact on marginalized groups; Decision-making must
    become more participatory and accountable to those most negatively affected by
    current food systems and their outcomes; Progress involves expanding access to
    assets, infrastructure and services; Interventions need to empower the poor and
    vulnerable.
  159: Addressing morbidity through targeted health services can enhance productivity,
    and there is a need to rethink social services delivery to benefit poor and vulnerable
    populations.
  162: COVID-19 has a significant impact on economic growth, incomes, and poverty
    levels, disproportionately burdening vulnerable communities; Pre-existing chronic
    vulnerabilities exacerbate the human cost of shocks and complicate effective responses.

  390: Small farms play a significant role in bovine milk and meat production, especially
    in China. Intensified smallholder dairy sectors could drive production growth,
    but beef production faces challenges due to farm size constraints.
  397: Most significant mitigation potential comes from reduced ruminant meat consumption
    and the land-sparing effect. Dietary changes have both environmental and health
    benefits and the potential economic impact is not yet known.
  398: Reducing livestock product demand has unknown social and economic costs, including
    impacts on farmers' income, employment and agricultural GDP.
  429: Opportunity costs of excluding genome editing from technology options to improve
    agricultural productivity are significant.
  433: LMICs with lagging research systems account for only 3% of total R&D investment
    in LMICs, have significantly smaller and less productive investments, and show
    considerably slower agricultural productivity growth. Stepping up R&D efforts
    in lagging and average countries could lead to enormous progress.
  442: "Pests remain a major barrier to crop production, with annual losses estimated\
    \ at between 20\u201340%. Climate change is predicted to increase the likelihood,\
    \ frequency, and impact of pests in the future, resulting in increased crop losses,\
    \ thus causing damage to the economy of low-income countries."

    \ outbreaks such as the S. gregaria outbreak 2019\u20132021."
  458: Food systems are driving additional economic losses due to supply chain inefficiencies;
    food systems contribute a large percentage of global GHG emissions; government
    spending on healthcare has risen dramatically
  464: Investment in innovative food solutions can lead to healthcare savings and
    contribute to carbon reduction goals. Farmland investment has generated excess
    returns compared to conventional asset classes.

  504: Emphasizes the importance of strengthening efforts to retain water-based ecosystems
    and improving agricultural water management to combat climate change and maintain
    food security.
  513: Climate change will affect food systems differentially across world regions;
    tropical and sub-tropical regions worldwide are expected to face detrimental changes
    to food systems. These changes impact food and nutrition security through complex
    mechanisms, including impacts on food availability, access, stability and utilization.
  514: Climate change impacts on food systems exacerbate hunger and micronutrient
    deficiencies. Climate change is negatively impacting crop production.
  521: Strengthening social protection is essential due to the differential impacts
    of climate change on food systems.
  531: No relevant information
  535: Agroforestry and organic agriculture show potential for carbon sequestration

    targets for outcomes that include environmental services and climate change outcomes,
    beyond just nutritional and livelihood outcomes.
  545: Loss of crop diversity poses a considerable risk to global food security because
    genetic diversity is the raw material of crop improvement.
  558: School-feeding programs linked with biodiversity education can increase awareness
    and diversify farm systems
  582: Internalizing externalities via true-cost accounting is proposed to redefine
    the value of food and address economic distortions in food systems.
  585: Externalities in the food system are not factored into crucial economic indicators
    for policymakers, leading to lower average living standards.
  589: The true cost of food is disproportionately high compared to its market price,
    with significant environmental and health costs. GHG emissions and land-use changes
    related to food production impose particularly high environmental costs.
  590: Environmental and economic costs associated with diets are highlighted, totalling
    slightly above 30 trillion $PPP.
  602: Affordability of food varies based on the type of food (e.g., animal-sourced
    foods are often less affordable). Substitution between different food types (e.g.,
    pulses for meat) can affect the cost of a basic meal.
  603: The cost of a basic plate can take a large fraction of the international poverty
    line and often exceeds the daily income of resource-poor households in some countries.
  609: Helpful healthy food processing (often by SMEs) should be supported, while
    harmful ultra-processing should be limited through regulation and taxation.
  623: Ending hunger requires doubling current aid flows for agriculture, food, and
    rural development. Short-term (social protection, nutrition programs) and long-term
    (agricultural R&D, irrigation) measures are needed. Investments with longer-term
    impacts should be frontloaded.
  632: Food security can be enhanced through multiple investment options that intensify
    agricultural production and improve agricultural productivity.
  636: The study uses projections that consider the impact of COVID-19 as the reference
    scenario for the population at risk of hunger in 2030.

    for social protection programmes.
  644: Table shows the least-cost rank of various interventions for lifting people
    out of hunger.
  646: Investments in various sectors like agriculture, infrastructure, and trade
    can significantly reduce hunger and undernourishment, but these investments are
    relatively expensive and require a longer implementation timeframe.
  647: The most important outcomes are the rankings of the interventions and the associated
    uncertainty levels for their effectiveness (people lifted out of hunger) and cost.
    This can help policymakers prioritize interventions based on a balance of potential
    impact and certainty.
  650: MACC analysis facilitates priority setting by governments and investment stakeholders
    by showing the costs of lifting people out of hunger. There is a tradeoff between
    climate change mitigation and hunger reduction, where mitigation projects potentially
    limit resources for addressing hunger.
  652: Achieving target 2.1 of SDG 2 need not be prohibitively expensive, provided
    that a mix of least-cost measures with large hunger reduction potential are prioritized.
    Investments with long-term effects should be frontloaded in the decade to have
    a large effect soon before 2030. Measures included in this analysis have the potential
    to lift about a billion people out of hunger over ten years until 2030.
  662: Table 2 shows that, on average for 2014-2019, Africa had 2.0% of total government
    outlays for AFF, Asia had 7.4%, and developed countries had 0.7%. The total for

    welfare.
  688: Trade could help countries adapt to short-term supply disruptions and long-term
    changes in comparative advantage triggered by climate change.
  689: Affected countries could adapt by importing food and shifting labor away from
    agriculture under climate change scenarios.
  690: A uniform global carbon price could curb emissions, but also reduce agricultural
    production, raise agricultural commodity prices, and impact food security, especially
    for developing countries. Unilateral carbon taxes may lead to emissions leakage,
    potentially increasing global emissions if imports are produced in systems with
    lower emissions efficiency. Border tax adjustments based on food products' carbon
    footprints could address the trade-off between food security and emission reduction
    targets.

    components. Six interventions were modeled to study their impact on agrifood systems,
    undernutrition, and the environment.
  142: The analysis uses an optimization program approach, minimizing the level of
    caloric hunger (PoU) subject to constraints. The duality principle from microeconomics
    is applied, relating maximizing utility with minimizing the budget needed to achieve
    a certain level of satisfaction.
  144: The analysis uses a production possibilities frontier (PPF) framework to illustrate
    trade-offs between the production of different goods (Maize and Pulses) under
    various constraints. Optimization problems are used to find the minimal level
    of poverty compatible with objective 3 and minimize public expenditure.

More Notes:
  56: The page focuses on food systems and their drivers, but doesn't explicitly address
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes related to climate change adaptation costs and
    benefits at a national level. It mentions climate change as one of the drivers
    influencing the food system, alongside socio-economic factors and global events
    like COVID-19.
  58: This page focuses heavily on food insecurity as a consequence of conflict, fragility,
    and climate events, but it does not offer nation-wide macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    risk estimates of climate change, nor does it analyze the costs and benefits of
    adaptation at a national level.
  64: The page focuses on food security, nutrition, and sustainable diets. While it
    discusses policy options that *could* influence food demand and reduce healthcare
    costs, it does not present any analysis that quantitatively ties these changes
    to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes at a national level. It mainly highlights
    potential co-benefits of a healthy and sustainable food system like reduction
    of GHG emissions and enhanced adaptive capacity. The information is therefore
    mostly related to micro-level outcomes (health, nutrition) and sectoral impacts
    (food systems) rather than direct economy-wide macroeconomic and macro-fiscal
    variables.
  69: Improved international cooperation and coordination of the food system is necessary;
    Research and technology advances are essential for solving critical constraints
    and offering many opportunities to improve productivity and food safety and reduce
    food losses and waste, as well as GHG emissions; Transformation of food systems
    is required, changing both supply and demand of food in differentiated ways across
    world regions; Global food system sustainability also requires halting the expansion
    of agriculture into fragile ecosystems while restoring degraded environments.

    \ and share of people with daily income below the cost of the EAT\u2013Lancet\
    \ reference diet, categorized by country income level and geographical region,\
    \ but doesn't directly link this to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes."
  129: The model assumes perfect competition in each market and uses a CES-LES utility
    function. It also uses an Armington assumption of imperfect substitutability between
    imported and domestic products.
  132: The choice of approach depends on the use of the modeling framework for the
    Agrifood Systems Summit (global/regional assessment or country-level profiles).
  133: The model currently operates under perfect competition, which may lead to optimistic
    views in terms of inequalities. The model adjusts the input-output coefficient
    matrix describing farm technologies. The household database does not include developed
    countries.
  134: The study uses the MIRAGRODEP model and links it to GLOBIOM and LIST models.
    The agrifood system is quantified in terms of its economic, social, environmental
    and risk factors (e.g. Jobs, Budget, GDP, Inequality, Poverty, Hunger, Diet, Obesity,
    Overweight, Water, Land use, Energy, Emissions, Soil health, Resilience, Disease,
    Food safety, Weather, Markets).
  137: The paper examines actions to reduce food waste/loss and improve livestock
    productivity and TFP. A key result is that combining different actions can significantly
    reduce the cost of achieving food security compared to relying solely on safety
    nets. A significant effort in global coordination and solidarity will be required,
    especially to support the transformation of the agrifood systems of low-income
    countries.
  138: The bar chart image visually presents the potential reduction in undernourishment
    by region (High, Middle, and Low Income Countries) for various interventions,
    with the 'Full package with safety nets' showing the highest reduction.
  139: The actions modeled will generate trade-offs in regard to GHG emissions, agricultural
    land, increase in the use of chemical inputs, and biodiversity.
  141: Explicit representation of household heterogeneity is crucial for providing
    a realistic picture and inclusive policy package. The model captures macroeconomic
    linkages, multisectoral interactions, and interactions for different households,
    including the poor and most vulnerable.
  151: The image showcases a cyclical process of building agency, changing relations,
    and transforming structures as a means to achieve more equitable outcomes.
  152: The conceptual framework of sustainable food systems highlights the interconnectedness
    of various factors influencing food systems, which can be relevant to understanding
    the broader economic impacts of climate change.
  180: The page focuses on gender dynamics within food systems and doesn't explicitly
    address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks or adaptation costs/benefits at a
    national level.
  219: The paper focuses on diversification of production and markets, and household
    responses, to illustrate the growing importance of diversification. Resilience
    is defined as financially equitable, supportive of the community, and minimizing
    harmful impacts on the environment.
  225: The relationships among diversification of production, diets, and markets are
    not straightforward and need more attention.
  232: The paper highlights the strategic importance of food supply for armed groups.
  248: This paper focuses on Indigenous Peoples' food systems, knowledge, and practices.
    It mentions promoting agroecological and regenerative agriculture, supporting
    Indigenous-led initiatives, and strengthening food security. However, it does
    not contain specific macroeconomic or macro-fiscal analysis, nor does it provide
    quantitative estimates or cost-benefit analyses related to climate change adaptation
    at a national level.
  249: The text is largely indecipherable and seems to be extracted OCR text with
    many errors. The document seems to be about food systems with an emphasis on Indigenous
    Peoples' rights and knowledge, but the connection to macroeconomic and macro-fiscal
    risks of climate change, and the costs and benefits of adaptation, is not clear
    on this page.
  264: No relevant information
  301: This paper focuses on urban food systems and provides recommendations for upgrading
    MSMEs and changing consumer environments to enable healthier food choices while
    maintaining affordability for the urban poor. It emphasizes coordination of SMEs
    rather than supporting agribusinesses and highlights the importance of accurate
    data on food consumption, foodsheds, and food chains. There is no discussion of
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks of climate change, nor costs and benefits
    of adaptation at a national level.
  336: This page focuses on the structural lock-ins within food production systems
    that hinder the transition to nature-positive approaches, and argues for policy
    coherence and landscape-level governance. It does not contain macroeconomic or
    fiscal risk assessments, or costs/benefits quantification of adaptation at a national
    level.
  397: There's an emphasis on exploring the economic mitigation potential of dietary
    changes as a future research area.
  398: The paper highlights the importance of considering micronutrients and protein
    in dietary scenarios, as well as culturally sensitive regional variants, and the
    heterogeneity of populations (rural/urban, under-or over-nourished, gender, age,
    or by age groups).
  433: The analysis focuses on the role of agricultural R&D investment and its impact
    on agricultural productivity growth in LMICs.
  435: The page emphasizes the importance of agricultural research and innovation
    for adapting to climate change and achieving sustainable development goals at
    the national level, especially in countries with smaller agricultural sectors
    and limited research capacity. IP frameworks in determining access to innovations
    are important.
  458: The paper suggests innovative approaches (technology, reallocation of government
    expenditure, promotion of nutritious diets) and food system innovation hubs as
    potential solutions in LMICs.
  464: The paper highlights the potential of vertical farming, farmland investment,
    and insect farming as investment-worthy cases for promoting nutritious food systems.
  472: The paper emphasizes the need for a shift towards regenerative production systems
    and the conservation of intact habitats to address challenges in agriculture and
    biodiversity loss.
  490: The paper emphasizes the potential for agriculture to reconcile food/nutritional
    security with environmental and climate security by placing biodiversity at the
    heart of agricultural policy, investment, and innovation.
  491: The paper advocates for a shift towards food system productivity rather than
    just agricultural productivity, requiring cross-sectoral collaboration within
    government and the creation of policy instruments and incentives for food production
    systems that leverage biodiversity.
  504: The discussion focuses on ecological processes and climate resilience in agricultural
    systems, rather than direct economic analysis.
  514: Climate change interacts with food systems impacting six of the 17 sustainable
    development goals.
  521: Empowering women and transitioning to healthy diets are crucial for addressing
    climate impacts on food security.
  531: No relevant information
  533: The review included approaches such as diversifying crop production, managing
    organic nutrient sources, biopesticides, crop-livestock integration, agroforestry,
    and organic farming.
  535: The study notes that evidence from Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)
    is limited, suggesting a potential bias towards temperate regions and high-income
    countries in the available data.
  545: The paper focuses on plant genetic resources, a subset of agricultural genetic
    resources.
  552: This page primarily discusses financing mechanisms for crop diversity and genebank
    support, with a focus on the Crop Trust. It does not directly address macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal risks of climate change, nor does it provide quantitative analysis
    of the costs and benefits of adaptation at a national level in terms of standard
    economic indicators. The bond issuance is related to SDG 2 and securing global
    food security.
  558: Emphasis on engaging young people and families through government programs
    to raise awareness about biodiversity conservation
  582: True-cost accounting approaches are suggested to measure and price externalities
    of food systems.
  585: The paper frames negative externalities as a problem of social injustice, rewarding
    unsustainable practices, and misallocation of capital.
  589: Substantial uncertainty exists in the estimates due to incomplete impact coverage,
    uncertainties in primary and trade data, modelling uncertainties, and uncertainty
    in monetization of external costs.
  590: The study emphasizes areas needing further research, including undernutrition,
    zoonoses, AMR, and social costs within the food systems.
  603: The analysis focuses on the cost of basic food plates and their affordability
    relative to income and the poverty line.
  609: The paper focuses on food systems and nutrition security, with an emphasis
    on the costs associated with food acquisition, preparation, and processing, and
    the need for better data collection and policy interventions in this area.
  623: The 'Achieving Zero Hunger' framework posits that hunger is a result of lack
    of purchasing power, and that eliminating hunger requires eliminating poverty.
  641: The analysis is focused on the cost of social protection programmes and trade
    agreements (AfCFTA, Doha Development Agenda) to reduce hunger.
  644: Interventions include agricultural efficiency enhancement, agricultural extension,
    ICT information services, small-scale irrigation expansion, agricultural improvements,
    female literacy, social protection programmes, crop insects and diseases protection,
    and COVID-19 protection.
  646: The study acknowledges that the estimates might understate the full benefits
    of these investments due to the exclusion of lagged benefits and their impact
    on other development outcomes beyond hunger.
  647: The categorization of uncertainty levels based on data source (econometric,
    simulation, assumptions) is important for understanding the robustness of any
    subsequent analysis that uses these interventions as inputs. The table focuses
    on hunger reduction interventions, and does not directly address climate change.
    However, given that climate change impacts food security, this information could
    be relevant for understanding the costs and benefits of adaptation measures in
    the agricultural sector.
  650: The study did not consider the linkages between climate change interventions
    and their impacts on hunger reduction programs. The paper acknowledges that the
    initial assumption of fixed marginal costs is unrealistic and that scaling effects
    lead to increasing marginal costs.
  652: The authors acknowledge that the spending priorities of those who could mobilize
    resources seem not sufficiently oriented toward overcoming hunger, and the voice
    and influence of the undernourished seem too weak to enforce investment action.
    Research into assessing the political economy for each of the considered interventions
    in the MACC might help to identify a set of politically acceptable second-best
    MACC elements that might differ from the marginal costs.
  662: The paper also mentions social assistance programs and their expenditures as
    a percentage of GDP (less than 1.2% for the countries in the ASPIRE database),
    although this is not directly related to climate change adaptation costs and benefits
    as described above.
  667: Table appears to present incremental investment needs and potentially the associated
    benefits/outcomes related to achieving SDG2 (ending hunger) in 2020. The table
    outlines flows of international development financing.
  680: This page mainly discusses the role of trade in food systems and its connection
    to economic development. It doesn't directly address macroeconomic/macro-fiscal
    risks of climate change or adaptation costs/benefits at a national level.
  688: The adaptive role of trade in ensuring food security could be constrained by
    trade restrictions and structural barriers to adjustment.
  690: The paper discusses the importance of accurate carbon footprint assessments
    for agricultural and food production to inform policy decisions related to taxing
    GHG emissions or labeling final products.
  702: No relevant information
  734: There are several initiatives to promote climate resilience, reforestation
    and restoration.
  738: The paper emphasizes the need for a multi-disciplinary approach to food security,
    considering natural resources, technology, food demand, and human behavior. It
    also highlights the importance of national/regional innovation ecosystems and
    the generalization of protection frameworks for the intellectual property of new
    technologies.
  745: This page focuses on food security and sustainable intensification of agriculture
    in Asia. While it discusses environmental costs associated with agriculture, it
    does not directly quantify macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks or adaptation costs/benefits
    at a national level. It is tangentially relevant in that food security risks are
    themselves a channel to economic risks.
  805: The page discusses the transformation of India's dairy sector through Operation
    Flood and subsequent de-licensing, and briefly mentions the poultry sector. The
    page emphasizes institutional innovations and policy support.
  821: Discussion on the need to shift agricultural production focus from staple crops
    to diverse crops with nutritional, social, and environmental benefits.
  880: The paper discusses the transformation of food systems and the need for universal
    access to healthy diets, environmentally sustainable practices, and a just transition
    that reduces inequality. The transition needs to be affordable at a time when
    countries are still grappling with the economic catastrophe of COVID-19.
  907: Lower food prices can have adverse income effects for producers and discourage
    ecosystem investments, while avoiding extreme price volatility is critical to
    support farm household investments.
  912: This page primarily discusses social and equity considerations within food
    systems, such as land rights, decent work, gender equality, and youth engagement,
    without directly linking them to specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes related
    to climate change adaptation at a national level.
  918: The paper focuses on food systems and their transformation. While it mentions
    modeling ecological effects in terms of GHG emissions, land and energy use, and
    the use of chemical inputs, there is no explicit link to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes at the national level that are the focus of this review.
