Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, specifically as represented by IPCC scenarios, leading to changes
    in agricultural production and land use.
  2: Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), climate change, average temperature
    increase, average rainfall reduction.
  3: Changes in rainfall and temperature due to climate change. Increase in CO2 and
    temperature levels favoring the growth of some crops offset by negative factors
    such as proliferation of pests and scarcity of water sources for irrigation, as
    well as changes in rainfall levels.
  5: Climate-related risks are not directly mentioned, but the dependence on specific
    sectors (agriculture, livestock, mining) within the Legal Amazon highlights potential
    vulnerabilities to climate change impacts on these sectors.
  6: Impacts of global warming on agricultural production leading to a decrease in
    agricultural productivity.
  7: Land use change driven by agricultural expansion, forestry, and deforestation;
    Yield differentials and supply elasticity of land.
  8: Climate change (precipitation and temperature changes) impacting agricultural
    productivity.
  9: Climate change leading to decline in land productivity, specifically impacting
    agriculture and livestock. Negative shock to land productivity.
  10: Climate change impacting crop area, pasture, planted forest, and natural forest.
  11: Changes in rainfall and temperature as a result of climate change affecting
    agricultural productivity.
  12: Projected climate change impacts on agricultural production by mesoregion and
    crop, reductions in livestock production, mainly cattle due to loss of pasture
    area.
  13: Changes in rainfall and temperature leading to decreased agricultural productivity.
  14: Climate change impacts on agricultural productivity, deforestation, land productivity
    shocks.
  16: Changes in the remuneration of agriculture relative to pasture land (demand
    side) influence land conversion rates.
  17: Sensitivity to parameterization of elasticity, especially in agriculture sectors
    like rice, corn, sugar, and soybean.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change is projected to cause a 1.18% loss in real GDP in the Legal Amazon
    by 2049 due to decreased agricultural production and employment. Deforestation
    will increase.
  2: Climate change will impact GDP, employment, income, consumption, migration flows,
    and food security.
  3: Climate change has great potential to trigger significant costs in the Brazilian
    economy, especially in agriculture and the Northern region. Effects of climate
    change are heterogeneous regionally and among economic sectors. Concentration
    of negative impacts on agricultural productivity due to climate change in the
    Legal Amazon region.
  5: The Legal Amazon plays a significant role in national agricultural production,
    particularly soybeans, cotton, maize, rice and manioc. The region's industrial
    GDP and growth are substantial, but concentrated in specific sectors and urban
    centers. Several states exhibit dependence on the public administration sector
    for income generation and formal occupations.
  6: The REGIA model's focus includes the economic dynamics prior to impacts from
    climate change in the Legal Amazon region.
  7: Land use change (specifically deforestation) is modeled as a proxy for the expansion
    of agriculture or forestry.
  8: The simulation captures only a portion of the impact of climate change on the
    Legal Amazon, specifically the effects of variations in average accumulated precipitation
    and average temperature on agricultural productivity.
  9: Climate change is likely to lead to an expansion of the agricultural frontier
    to compensate for decreased soil productivity, likely causing deforestation. Regions
    with economies focused mainly on agriculture-export activities are most affected.
    The net effect is influenced by the characteristics and integration of regional
    trade and the productive structure of the regions.
  10: Climate change is projected to impact land use across different mesoregions
    and states within the Amazonia Legal region, resulting in both gains and losses
    in crop area, pasture, planted forest, and natural forest, with an aggregate loss
    of natural forest (-0.9 million hectares) across the whole region, and an aggregate
    increase in agriculture (2.1 million hectares).
  11: "Metropolitanade Bel\xE9m will be among the most impacted areas concerning crop\
    \ reduction; major reductions in sugar cane and soybean production across various\
    \ mesoregions."
  12: "Certain states and mesoregions like Amap\xE1 and Norte Amazonense may experience\
    \ benefits in production of rice, corn, and soybeans due to climate change."
  13: Climate change will have a prejudicial impact on the economy of the Legal Amazon,
    with heterogeneous effects across the territory; eastern and southern regions
    are most affected. Mato Grosso and Tocantins will be the most affected states
    due to their greater dependence on agricultural activities.
  14: Climate change can have adverse effects on the economic and social dynamics
    of the Legal Amazon region, with heterogeneous regional and sectoral impacts.
    The agricultural sector is significantly affected.
  16: Land supply elasticities vary significantly across different regions of Brazil,
    ranging from 0.3 to 1.65.
  17: Results for GDP, investment, and household consumption are generally robust,
    but agriculture sector impacts in some regions are sensitive to parameterization.
Methodology:
  1: Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, REGIA - Inter-regional General Equilibrium
    Model for the Brazilian Legal Amazon, is used to assess the impacts.
  2: Uses the REGIA model, an interregional CGE model for Brazil, specifically modeled
    for the regions of the Legal Amazon. Climate change scenarios on agricultural
    productivity were based on information provided by Assuncao and Chein (2016) for
    the period 2030 to 2049.
  3: Interregional CGE model used with shocks related to land availability to assess
    the economic impact of climate change effects on states of northeastern Brazil.
    Inter-regional EGC model used for 27 federation units in Brazil. Simulations were
    based on the A2 and B2 climate scenarios of the IPCC for the year 2020 and 2070.
    CGE model integrated with other modules of energy, agriculture, and demographics.
  5: The data is based on production figures from IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography
    and Statistics) and sectoral analysis of the Legal Amazon region. The results
    are applicable to the economic structure of the Legal Amazon and its contribution
    to the national economy in the specified time periods.
  6: The model includes an indirect land use change (ILUC) module crucial for assessing
    the decrease in agricultural productivity due to climate change.
  7: REGIA model uses a CET (constant elasticity of transformation) function to allocate
    land between agricultural sectors; A transition matrix controls conversion between
    land uses in different years; Elasticity varies according to the size of the available
    area; Variation of land demand equals the variation of the land supply.
  8: 'A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is used to simulate the impact
    of climate change on land productivity in the agricultural sector, with shocks
    applied to the ''alnd'' variable representing technological change of the primary
    factor ''land''.  The model uses a recursive dynamics approach and two closures:
    historical/baseline and policy.  It focuses on the period 2030-2049, building
    on the A1B climate scenario from the IPCC 4th report.'
  9: Uses the REGIA model to simulate the effects of climate change on regional economies,
    comparing a baseline scenario with a scenario incorporating climate change effects.
    Model considers land use dynamics, productivity, relative profitability of crops,
    and intersectoral/interregional relations. The model is applied to mesoregions.
  10: The table shows accumulated changes between 2030 and 2049, suggesting a simulation
    or modeling approach comparing climate change scenarios with a baseline. The applicability
    is limited to the specific regions and time frame studied.
  12: Simulations projecting the impact of climate change on agricultural production
    and macroeconomic variables.
  13: Simulation of productivity decrease due to climatic changes on main agricultural
    crops in the Brazilian Legal Amazon from 2030 to 2049, projecting impacts on land
    use and economic indicators.
  16: A transition matrix is adjusted annually based on changes in land use driven
    by the relative profitability of agriculture vs. pasture, affecting the supply
    of land devoted to cropland (Carvalho et al., 2017). The REGIA model is used to
    calculate these values, according to information in Appendix C.
  17: Systematic sensitivity analysis using Gaussian quadrature to treat the EGC model
    as a numerical integration problem.
More Notes:
  1: "The impact is not homogeneous across the Legal Amazon region, with Mato Grosso,\
    \ Tocantins, and Par\xE1 being more affected."
  2: The study focuses on the Legal Amazon region and its vulnerability to climate
    change.
  5: The Legal Amazon's economic activity is significantly driven by agriculture,
    livestock, mining, and industry, which are all potentially susceptible to climate
    change impacts. The concentration of industrial activity in a few urban centers
    and dependence of some states on public administration could amplify the impact
    of shocks in those sectors.
  7: The Legal Reserve (RL) and Permanent Preservation Areas (APPs) are removed from
    available land to calculate the elasticity of land use supply.
  8: The model does not incorporate other climate change effects such as floods, storms,
    droughts, or shocks over other sectors, nor does it account for technological
    advancements. The simulation results should be interpreted as deviations from
    a baseline scenario without climate change.
  9: The impact is not read as absolute falls but relative variations against a scenario
    where changes do not occur. The results depend on the productive structure and
    intersectoral relations of each region, as well as their integration in regional
    trade. The influence of the productivity structure of the model is reinforced
    by the participation of the sector impacted by the productivity shock on the regional
    GDP.
  11: Cassava has a small decrease in production but is crucial for food security,
    especially impacting vulnerable family farmers.
  13: The model considers indirect impacts on livestock and forest production through
    factor allocation changes in response to productivity shocks in the agricultural
    sector.
  14: The analysis focuses on the Legal Amazon region of Brazil. Table A.1 provides
    further details on land productivity shocks.
  16: The study uses the REGIA model and land supply elasticities to simulate land
    use changes based on economic incentives and assess the impacts on agriculture.
    The model considers the transition from pasture to cropland.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Loss in real GDP in the Legal Amazon region.
  2: Impacts on GDP, employment, income, consumption, migration flows, and food security.
  3: Brazilian agriculture is vulnerable to climatic conditions, leading to reduced
    crop productivity, changes in land use, losses of agricultural areas, and devaluation
    of agricultural land. Climate change can cause a reduction in forests and increased
    pastures in Brazil. Northeastern Brazil could see a 13.1% drop in GDP and a 5.95%
    reduction in employment between 2010 and 2050 due to climate change. Monetary
    losses on Brazilian agriculture will be relatively low in the long term, but with
    greater damage to poorer regions, especially in low-income families. GDP losses
    of R$ 719 billion in 2050 (A2-BR scenario) and R$ 3.6 billion in B2-BR scenario.
    Worst economic losses will affect the North and Northeast regions, the poorest
    in Brazil. Negative effects on agricultural productivity concentrated in the Legal
    Amazon region.
  5: The industrial GDP of the Legal Amazon totaled R$34.9 billion in 2010, representing
    26% of the total GDP of the Legal Amazon and 8.6% of the national industrial GDP.
  7: No relevant information
  8: Changes in agricultural productivity at the municipal and regional levels.
  9: Negative shock of land productivity leads to decreased production, decreased

    consumption decrease, export decrease, import decrease, crop yield decreases.
  16: Land supply elasticities, which can influence agricultural production and economic
    activity in different regions.
  17: Aggregate results for regions, such as GDP, investment, and household consumption,
    are robust but slightly sensitive to parameters in later years (2040-2050).

    \ tons), 67% of national cotton seed, 30% of maize production, 14% of rice, 4%\
    \ of sugarcane, and 41% of national manioc production. 70% of the national herd\
    \ growth occurred in the Legal Amazon region between 1990 and 2005. Par\xE1 accounts\
    \ for 37% of the industrial GDP of the Legal Amazon."
