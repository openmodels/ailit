Highlights:
  3: Global warming initially increases obesity rates, then decreases them at very
    high temperatures, with significant variance across regions; long-term models
    suggest adaptation does not significantly offset impacts in temperate zones.
  4: Obesity is an important pathway through which global warming can detrimentally
    affect human capital and economic outcomes.
  8: The paper investigates the causal effect of temperature on obesity. The paper
    also investigates the extent to which the effect of warming on obesity varies
    across countries with different incomes.
  9: The paper aims to address the benefits of adaptation to long-term temperature
    trends by using a long-difference model. It is highlighted that the baseline model
    may not sufficiently account for the benefits of adaptation.
  10: Warming has a significantly positive impact on the adult obesity rate. Models
    with third to fifth degree temperature polynomials better capture the nonlinear
    effect.
  11: "Warming increases obesity rates positively in most countries; however, in tropical\
    \ countries with annual mean temperatures above 27\xB0C, warming reduces obesity\
    \ rates."
  13: The relationship between annual mean temperature and obesity rate exhibits an
    inverted U-shape. The results are robust to different control variables. Within-country
    population migration has a minor effect on the estimated effect.
  15: Warming has a greater impact on obesity in poorer countries, countries with
    older populations, and countries with more educated populations.
  16: The impact of warming on obesity is heterogeneous, varying with factors such
    as GDP per capita, age, and education. Warming has a greater impact on male obesity
    rates compared to female obesity rates.
  17: Males are more exposed to the impact of global warming due to work exposing
    them to high temperatures. The impact on Africa and the Americas is smaller, while
    the impact on the Eastern Mediterranean and Asia is larger. The impact on Europe
    is very similar to the global average impact.
  18: Higher temperature seasons significantly increase obesity, while low-temperature
    seasons have negligible effects.
  19: Higher temperatures may be associated with increased obesity rates. There is
    an upward trend from season 1 to season 4, suggesting an increase in the marginal
    effect on obesity rate with higher temperatures.
  20: Warming of high-temperature seasons can increase obesity rates. The effect of
    temperature variation on obesity first increases with temperature variation and
    then levels off when the variation is very high.
  21: Positive temperature shocks initially enhance and then reduce the adult obesity
    rate, consistent with the effect pattern of annual mean temperature.
  22: There is a possible correlation between temperature shocks and increased obesity
    rates.
  23: Global warming tends to reduce income and increase food prices. Lower real income
    tends to reduce obesity in poorer, tropical countries by limiting consumption.
    In contrast, in wealthier, temperate countries, lower real income often leads
    to an increase in obesity due to a shift towards cheaper, less healthy foods.
    Global warming is likely to increase obesity through consumption preferences,
    working hours, physical activity, and minimum calorie requirements.
  24: Warming temperatures are associated with changes in calorie requirements, physical
    exercise, and calorie/fat intake. Calorie demand decreases with increasing temperature
    initially and increases again at even higher temperatures. Physical exercise decreases
    as temperature increases. Calorie and fat intake also exhibit a U-shaped relationship
    with temperature.
  25: Higher temperatures initially increase obesity rates, then reduce them, with
    differing thresholds between short-run and long-run models.
  26: Global warming is likely to increase obesity and could result in an economic
    loss of approximately $276.6 billion by 2050.
  27: Global warming may increase obesity in temperate zones and decrease it in subtropical
    and tropical zones.
  28: Long-term adaptation may not significantly reduce the impact of global warming
    on obesity. Warming may have a more positive impact on obesity in temperate zones
    over time, but a more negative impact in subtropical and tropical zones, likely
    due to reduced income and consumption.
  29: Global warming significantly increased obesity in most countries, with the exception
    of a small number of tropical countries.

Methodology:
  3: The analysis employs multiple model settings, including a baseline third-degree
    temperature polynomial model and alternative approaches using temperature bins,
    seasonal mean temperature, and temperature shocks to validate the effects of global
    warming on obesity.
  4: Examines the overall impact of warming on obesity based on long-run global data
    and evaluates the potential of long-run adaptation in offsetting this impact,
    using different model settings to identify short-run and long-run effects.
  5: The analysis uses data from 1975 to 2016 for 152 countries with a population
    size larger than half a million in 2000. Country-level climate measures are calculated
    as the population-weighted average across all climate grids within each country,
    derived from the LandScan Program. Climate data is obtained from the Climatic
    Research Unit.
  7: The analysis is conducted using a fixed effect panel model comparing the same
    country over time, accounting for inter-annual temperature fluctuations deemed
    random and not influenced by confounding factors.
  8: The analysis uses country fixed effects to account for cross-country temperature
    differences and year-to-year temperature fluctuations to identify the effect of
    temperature on obesity. A temperature polynomial is used to capture the non-linear
    effect of temperature. Robustness checks are performed including year fixed effects
    and different methods for modeling the nonlinear effect of temperature. The results
    are applicable to countries over the sample period.
  9: Uses a baseline model (1) that captures the short-run impact using year-to-year
    temperature fluctuations and a "long-difference" model (6) to capture the long-run
    impact using long-term temperature trends. The baseline model uses temperature
    polynomials to capture non-linear effects. Various temperature measures are used
    for robustness checks. A panel long-difference model is used.  Model (5) appears
    to be some kind of marginal effects model (although without knowing the dependent
    variable it is hard to specify). Model (6) expresses the outcome variable as a
    function of temperature, average income and other variables represented by X.
    The models account for short-run impacts and also long-run adaptation.
  10: The paper compares a short-run model (year-to-year temperature variations) and
    a long-run model (30-year temperature trends) to identify the effects of temperature
    on obesity. The long-run model uses long differences in temperature calculated
    from 1945-1975 to 2016. The difference between short-run and long-run marginal
    effects is used to infer adaptation, but this is not the only factor that could
    explain the difference.
  11: The analysis uses response functions derived from temperature polynomials of
    various degrees and includes an interaction with log GDP per capita to explore
    moderating effects.
  13: Regression analysis with various control variables (carbon emissions, crude
    death rate, year fixed effects, population weights) to assess the robustness of
    the temperature-obesity relationship. Utilizes country-level mean temperature
    calculated based on gridded population weights. Standard errors clustered at the
    country level.
  15: Linear regression model with country fixed effects, country-specific time trends,
    and control variables (log GDP per capita, average adult age, and average adult
    years of schooling from 1975).
  16: The marginal effects of warming on obesity are calculated based on estimates
    from column 2 of Table 1 of the original paper. The heterogeneity of the impact
    of warming on obesity is assessed across the distribution of country-level log
    GDP per capita, adult average age, and adult average years of schooling. Columns
    3 and 4 estimate the effects of warming on the obesity rate of adult males and
    females.
  17: "Excludes one geographic region at a time to assess the significance of each\
    \ region's contribution to the estimated impact of warming on obesity. Uses country-level\
    \ monthly minimum and maximum temperatures to create 3\xB0C bins ranging from\
    \ 0\xB0C to 30\xB0C and estimates impact using a modified version of a baseline\
    \ model."
  18: The analysis uses temperature bins and a polynomial model to estimate marginal
    effects on obesity, assessing seasonal temperature impacts by dividing the year
    into four temperature-ranked groups.
  19: "Regression model estimates with standard errors clustered at the country level.\
    \ Two models are presented: one using temperature bins and another using seasonal\
    \ mean temperatures. The sixth temperature bin (12-15 \xB0C) was excluded from\
    \ the first model due to perfect collinearity."
  20: A seasonal model is used to analyze the impact of temperature increases in different
    seasons on obesity rates. A separate model (12) uses a third-degree polynomial
    of temperature variation to predict obesity rates. The models include country
    fixed effects.
  21: Regression analysis is used to model the relationship between obesity and temperature
    shocks, controlling for other variables. The analysis considers the number of
    months in a year where temperature exceeds one standard deviation above the long-run
    average.
  22: The response function of obesity to positive temperature shocks is constructed
    based on estimates from model (13). Confidence intervals are calculated based
    on standard errors clustered at the country level.
  23: Relies on findings from existing literature to infer channels through which
    warming impacts obesity; uses a modified version of a model to estimate effects
    of temperature on minimum calorie demand, physical exercise, calorie intake, and
    fat intake.
  24: The analysis uses a modified version of a model (1) with distinct dependent
    variables. Both short-run and long-run impacts are considered, with the long-run
    model using a third-degree temperature polynomial. Country-level and US state-level
    data are used.
  25: Utilizes a third-degree temperature polynomial as the primary explanatory variable
    in a long-run model based on 30-year temperature trends.
  26: Predictions are generated by combining the estimated country-level marginal
    effects with the projected temperature changes for each country from 2016 to 2050,
    based on the intermediate emissions scenario SSP2-4.5 from CMIP6. Nonlinear marginal
    effects of temperature on obesity are estimated using a third-degree version of
    model (1).
  27: The analysis combines estimated marginal effects of temperature on obesity with
    projected warming scenarios. Short-run and long-run models are used, with the
    long-run model relying on long-term temperature trends and the short-run model
    relying on short-term temperature trends.
  28: The analysis uses short-run and long-run models to estimate the impact of warming
    on obesity, considering country-specific marginal effects and predicted warming
    levels. The difference between these models is used to infer the potential for
    adaptation.
  29: Estimates the causal effect of global warming on obesity using plausibly exogenous
    year-to-year temperature fluctuations. Long-term adaptation is inferred by comparing
    a baseline model with a long-difference model.

More Notes:
  1: Identifies substantial heterogeneity in the impact across countries with varying
    income levels, age structures, and education levels.
  4: The study differs from previous research by focusing on obesity (BMI exceeding
    30 kg/m2) rather than BMI in general, examining both short-run and long-run effects,
    evaluating the extent to which long-run adaptation could offset the impact of
    global warming on obesity, and examining potential channels through which global
    warming affects obesity.
  5: 'The study incorporates five other climate variables as control variables: annual
    total precipitation, wet day frequency, frost day frequency, cloud cover percentage,
    and vapor pressure.'
  9: The paper uses different temperature measures to capture nonlinear effects and
    test the robustness of the results. It also considers the impact of within-year
    temperature variation and shocks.
  13: The paper examines the heterogeneity of the impact concerning income level,
    age structure, education level, gender, and geographic region in another subsection
    (not detailed on this page).
  16: The paper references Graff Zivin and Neidell (2014) in relation to physical
    labor and sports activities under high temperatures, but the details of that study
    are not provided here.
  19: Preference is to estimate the effects of the four seasons in a single model
    as it could help mitigate potential biases arising from temperature correlations
    across seasons.
  20: The seasonal model provides additional information compared to the baseline
    model using annual average temperature, but cannot capture nonlinear effects observed
    when temperatures are very high.
  21: The temperature variation is defined according to Eq. (11) of the paper, positive
    temperature shocks are from Ashraf and Michalopoulos (2015); Miller et al. (2021).
    The functional form includes a third-degree polynomial of the temperature shock
    variable.
  22: Global warming can influence calorie intake by altering income, food prices,
    and consumption preferences, and it can impact calorie expenditure by changing
    working hours, levels of physical activity, and minimum calorie requirements.
    Global warming could also impact population structure through changes in birth
    rates, death rates, and migration patterns.
  24: The study uses both country-level and US state-level data depending on data
    availability.
  27: The paper attempts to infer the effect of adaptation by comparing the predicted
    impacts from the short-run and long-run models.
  28: The study suggests a need for a more active role of the public sector in addressing
    the effects of global warming on obesity. The analysis relies on Fig. 11 and Fig.
    14, not present in this page.
  29: The study identifies substantial heterogeneity in the impact across countries
    in various regions and with differing income levels, age structures, and education
    levels. Long-term adaptation may not significantly mitigate the impact of global
    warming on obesity in temperate zones. Study only captures the country-average
    effects of warming on obesity.

    to increase obesity in most countries from temperate zones while reducing obesity
    in most countries from subtropical and tropical zones. Population-weighted average
    impact of warming on obesity across the 152 sample countries is 1.2 percentage
    points. Global warming will increase the number of obese individuals worldwide
    by 89.9 million from 2016 to 2050. Global warming could result in an economic
    loss of approximately $276.6 billion by increasing obesity worldwide.
  27: Global warming from 2016 to 2050 would result in 76.8 million more obese individuals
    in temperate zones and 106.9 million fewer obese individuals in subtropical and
    tropical zones.
