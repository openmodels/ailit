Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (primarily global warming), leading to increased number of poor
    and migrants, risks to human health (especially in cities), and hindering sustainable
    economic development; Dangerous hydrometeorological events.
  2: Insufficient development and implementation of national adaptation plans as a
    response to climate change risks.
  5: Climate change, specifically warming, which is happening faster in Russia (especially
    the Arctic) than the global average; degradation of permafrost; hydro-meteorological
    events and disasters.
  10: Climate change impact.
Highlights:
  1: Adaptation is being sidelined despite the Paris Agreement's emphasis on balanced
    efforts between mitigation and adaptation; Adaptation measures are highly economically
    efficient (including a multiplier effect); Adaptation is crucial for ensuring
    sustainable long-term socio-economic development in Russia; There is a need to
    increase the role of adaptation in strategic planning.
  2: Adaptation of economies to climate change has been deprioritized, with only a
    small fraction of countries having developed national adaptation plans (NAPs),
    and even fewer implementing effective measures.
  5: Russia's vulnerability to climate change is higher than the global average due
    to faster warming, particularly in the Arctic, leading to significant economic
    damage, especially from permafrost degradation. Adaptation measures are crucial
    and have immediate, localized benefits, unlike decarbonization efforts which have
    a delayed and globally distributed impact.
  6: Early warning systems are the most effective adaptation investment (10:1 benefit-cost
    ratio).
  10: Adaptation measures have high economic efficiency (multiplier effect inclusive);
    Adaptation is crucial for maintaining sustainable long-term socioeconomic development
    in Russia; Adaptation is undervalued compared to decarbonization.
Methodology:
  10: "Analysis within the context of sustainable development strategies at world\
    \ and national (Russian) economies\u2019 level; stresses the importance of adaptation\
    \ planning and implementation; highlights the need for integration of adaptation\
    \ policy into sustainable long-term development strategies."
More Notes:
  1: The article focuses on the Russian economy within the context of global sustainable
    development strategies; The study received funding from the Russian Science Foundation.
  5: The paper emphasizes the importance of adaptation measures for Russia's sustainable
    socio-economic development, arguing that adaptation is immediately relevant and
    effective in reducing climate risks, especially given the country's vulnerability
    and the potential ineffectiveness of decarbonization efforts. It suggests adaptation
    can become the 'insurer' of last resort if decarbonization proves insufficient.
  10: The paper argues for increased emphasis on adaptation relative to decarbonization
    in strategic decision-making, particularly in Russia; Suggests learning from international
    experience, particularly from the EC.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic efficiency of adaptation measures; Losses and damages from climate change
    and its consequences for socio-economic development.
  5: Economic damage from permafrost degradation in the Arctic zone of the Russian
    Federation; potential costs for adapting infrastructure to climate change.
  6: 'Mentions the ''triple dividend'' of adaptation: (1) reduced human losses and
    economic damage; (2) increased income and productivity due to risk reduction,
    job creation, and innovation; (3) environmental and cultural benefits (recreation,
    tourism).'
  10: Economic efficiency of adaptation measures, costs and benefits of adaptation,
    losses and damage from climate change impact, maintenance of sustainable long-term
    socioeconomic development.
Quantitative material:
  1: Benefits of adaptation measures on average exceed costs by a factor of four.
  2: By 2019, adaptation spending in developing countries reached 70 billion USD,
    less than 0.15% of their collective GDP.
  5: Expected damage from permafrost degradation in 2020-2050 for Arctic municipalities
    is estimated at 5-7 trillion rubles, or 200 billion rubles per year on average.
    Additional adaptation costs for infrastructure (primarily roads and social infrastructure)
    are estimated at at least 50 billion rubles per year on average.
  6: A delay of 10 years in adaptation investment decisions increases adaptation costs
    by an average of twofold for developing countries (low and middle incomes).
  10: World average benefits of adaptation surpassing costs four-fold.
