Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (global temperature change), economic growth, income distribution,
    climatic tipping points
  2: Temperature change (driven by representative concentration pathways - RCPs),
    economic cost of tipping points
  4: Climate change impacts productivity via a damage function; inequality is another
    driver of poverty explored in the paper.
  5: Temperature and precipitation variation affecting income disparities, agricultural
    impact, and food prices.
  7: Temperature change, socioeconomic development pathways, climate pathways, inequality
    relationships, economic relationships
  9: Climate change (changing temperature).
  10: Different scenarios of socioeconomic development and emissions (SSP-RCP scenarios)
    influence the number of people falling into poverty due to climate change.
  11: Climate change, modeled through different scenarios (IFs-RCP 6.0, SSP1-RCP 2.6,
    SSP2-RCP 4.5, SSP3-RCP 6.0, SSP4-RCP 6.0, SSP5-RCP 8.5), and potential climate
    tipping points.
  12: Climate change scenarios (RCPs) and surpassing tipping points.
  13: Climate change scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, RCP 8.5), Income inequality
  15: Climate change (specifically, the SSP2-RCP 4.5 scenario).
Highlights:
  1: Forecasts of climate-driven poverty increases are lower than estimates made using
    bottom-up approaches. Tipping points are a significant threat to future socioeconomic
    development and drive significant increases in poverty across scenarios. Long-term
    effects of climate change on poverty could be mitigated with a sustained effort
    to improve income distribution.
  2: The approach uses macro-level relationships that do not capture the full extent
    of climate-human interactions, and results should be interpreted as the product
    of the methodology and not point predictions about what will happen. The impact
    of climate change on poverty may be underestimated by neglecting micro-level dynamics.
    Balancing the role of technology as a driver of both socioeconomic development
    and climate change will be crucial.
  4: Uses a damage function approach to gauge economic losses from worsening climate
    conditions.
  5: Identifies agricultural activity as a key channel through which climate change
    exacerbates inequality.
  7: The study uses the IFs model to simulate the impact of different SSP-RCP scenarios
    on key indicators, comparing results with and without forward linkages from temperature
    change to inequality or economic production. The poverty calculation in IFs is
    based on the assumption of a log-normal income distribution.
  9: "Climate change is projected to reduce global GDP across all scenarios, with\
    \ reductions ranging from -0.2 to -0.6% by 2030, -0.8 to -1.5% by 2050, and -0.8\
    \ to -3.2% by 2070. This translates to a cumulative economic loss of $1.1\u2013\
    6.9 trillion by 2030, $17\u201365.7 trillion by 2050, and $78.8\u2013344.1 trillion\
    \ by 2070. Climate change is also projected to increase global inequality."
  10: 'The worst-case SSP3-RCP 6.0 scenario projects a significant increase in poverty:
    30 million by 2030, 78 million by 2050, and 130 million by 2070.'
  11: By 2070, nearly 40% of the population living on less than $1.90 per day will
    be attributable to climate change in an IFs-RCP 6.0 scenario. This percentage
    decreases as the income threshold increases.
  12: "By 2100, surpassing climate tipping points could result in a global GDP loss\
    \ of 25% relative to a \u2018No Climate Change\u2019 scenario."
  13: Sustained efforts to improve income distribution can mitigate the long-term
    effects of climate change on poverty. Under extreme climate scenario of RCP 8.5,
    a fifteen percent reduction in income inequality would be necessary to offset
    increased poverty
  15: Climate change could lead to an additional 40 million people in extreme poverty
    by 2050 under the SSP2-RCP 4.5 scenario.
Methodology:
  1: Uses the International Futures (IFs) model, projecting poverty across income
    thresholds for 175 countries through 2070, combining RCPs with economic growth
    and inequality series from the SSPs.
  2: Uses the International Futures (IFs) modeling system, operationalizes the relationship
    between temperature change, economic activity, and inequality, uses DICE model
    damage function, adjusts SSP scenarios modeling the future of economic growth
    and inequality for expected changes based on literature.
  4: Captures the impact of climate change on productivity via a damage function.
    Uses findings from Dietz et al. (2021) to operationalize the impact of tipping
    points.
  5: Uses RCP temperature trajectories, damage functions, and SSP forecasts for economic
    production, income distribution, population change from 2017 to 2070.
  7: Uses the International Futures (IFs) model, a six-sector general equilibrium
    model. The model simulates production using Cobb-Douglas type production functions,
    initializes inter-sectoral flows with GTAP data, and updates poverty rates based
    on changes in projected consumption and the Gini index of inequality.
  9: The analysis uses the DICE model damage function and various Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to project the
    impact of climate change on global economic growth and inequality.
  10: The analysis compares various SSP-RCP scenarios to illustrate potential outcomes
    without longitudinal error bands, focusing on different socioeconomic and emissions
    scenarios.
  11: The study uses Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) and Shared Socioeconomic
    Pathways (SSPs) combined with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to
    model the impact of climate change on poverty rates.
  12: Use of IFs-RCP model scenarios to estimate GDP effects and poverty outcomes.
  13: Analysis uses established macro-level relationships to project the impact of
    climate change on poverty across different countries and income thresholds under
    different SSP-RCP combinations using the IFs model.
  15: Model estimates using the IFs software platform.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the pathway from climate change through socioeconomic development
    to the future of poverty. The analysis considers central tendency scenarios with
    climate effects compared with scenarios that do not model climate change.
  4: The page briefly mentions the role of climate tipping points and their incorporation
    into the analysis.
  7: The IFs model represents flows among households, firms, and the government, as
    well as international trade. Agents in the IFs model optimize each annual time
    step on the path to equilibrium. The paper focuses on coherent SSP-RCP combinations,
    such as SSP5-RCP 8.5, and compares IFs results to RCP 6.0.
  12: Sensitivity analysis tested the relationship between income inequality and climate-induced
    poverty.
  13: The study looks further into the future, shows results at the country level
    and across income thresholds, and presents a comprehensive range of SSP-RCP combinations
    to inform thinking about the relationship between economic development, climate
    change, and poverty.
  15: The authors highlight that this number is lower than model estimates of the
    impact of COVID-19 and intrastate conflict on poverty. They emphasize the need
    for mitigation and adaptation policies and balancing socio-economic development
    with environmental consequences.
