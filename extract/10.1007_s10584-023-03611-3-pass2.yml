Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global temperature change (representative concentration pathways)
  3: Climate change impacts poverty through increased prices of food, housing, and
    healthcare, reduced labor productivity and work hours, especially due to increased
    temperatures.
  4: Rising temperatures, precipitation anomalies, climate tipping points (permafrost
    melt, ice sheet disintegration, Amazon die-back).
  5: Temperature variation, precipitation variation, climate change, depressed agricultural
    yields.
  7: The drivers of risk are different RCP scenarios representing varying levels of
    greenhouse gas emissions and resulting temperature changes.
  9: Changing temperature (climate change).
  10: Climate change, socioeconomic development, and emissions scenarios (SSP-RCP
    combinations).
  11: Climate change (implied from context and discussion of RCP scenarios).
  12: Climate change impacts, specifically RCP scenarios and surpassing tipping points.
  13: Climate change, income inequality, economic production and fossil fuel use are
    the primary drivers.
  15: Climate change, as represented by the SSP2-RCP 4.5 scenario.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Poverty, specifically the number of people living in poverty due to climate change.
  3: This page provides an overview of the impact of climate change on poverty, indicating
    it remains a significant challenge for socioeconomic development.

    income distribution, population change.
  7: The study evaluates the climate-attributable impact of different SSP-RCP scenarios
    on economic outcomes and poverty.

    population, and extreme poverty.
  9: Global economic growth and global Gini coefficient (inequality).
  10: Global poverty (extreme, poverty, and moderate) measured in millions of people.
  11: Effect of climate on poverty across different poverty thresholds ($1.90, $3.20,
    $5.50).

Highlights:
  1: Forecasts of climate-driven poverty increases in this paper are lower than estimates
    made using bottom-up approaches. Tipping points are a significant threat to future
    socioeconomic development and drive significant increases in poverty across scenarios.
    Long-term effects of climate change on poverty could be mitigated with a sustained
    effort to improve income distribution.
  3: The most important outcome highlighted is that climate change significantly impacts
    poverty by affecting prices, productivity, and income, leading to challenges in
    socioeconomic development.
  4: Climate change impacts are modeled to affect productivity and increase poverty,
    driven by rising temperatures, precipitation anomalies, and climate tipping points.
    The impact of tipping points can be operationalized through their effect on the
    social cost of carbon.
  5: Climate change exacerbates inequality, directly and indirectly, with agricultural
    activity identified as one of the most important channels. Depressed agricultural
    yields directly affect rural income and indirectly affect poor urban populations
    via increased food prices.
  7: The study compares scenarios with and without forward linkages from temperature
    change to inequality and economic production.
  8: Population projections are an important driver of poverty headcounts.
  9: "Climate change is projected to reduce GDP across all scenarios, with GDP reduction\
    \ ranging from \u22120.2 to \u22120.6% by 2030, \u22120.8 to \u22121.5% by 2050,\
    \ and \u22120.8 to \u22123.2% by 2070. This represents a significant reduction\
    \ in overall cumulative economic activity, estimated at $1.1\u20136.9 trillion\
    \ by 2030, $17\u201365.7 trillion by 2050, and $78.8\u2013344.1 trillion by 2070.\
    \ Climate change also increases global inequality (Gini coefficient) under all\
    \ scenarios."
  10: Climate change is projected to increase global poverty, with the magnitude depending
    on the socioeconomic development and emissions scenario. SSP3-RCP 6.0 results
    in the largest increases in poverty.
  11: By 2070, nearly 40% of the population living on less than $1.90 per day will
    be attributable to climate change in an IFs-RCP 6.0 scenario. This percentage
    decreases as the income threshold increases.
  12: 'In an RCP 2.6 world, global income inequality would need to be improved by
    five percent through 2070 to eliminate climate-attributable poverty. '
  13: The future impact of climate change on human development is characterized by
    significant uncertainty and that human choices related to mitigation can significantly
    reduce the climate-induced burden on poverty. Sustained efforts to improve income
    distribution can mitigate the long-term effects of climate change on poverty.
  15: Climate change (under SSP2-RCP 4.5) is projected to push 40 million more people
    into extreme poverty by 2050.
Methodology:
  1: Uses the International Futures (IFs) model, projecting poverty across income
    thresholds for 175 countries through 2070. Combines RCPs with economic growth
    and inequality series from the SSPs.
  3: The analysis methodology or its applicability timeframe is not discussed in detail
    on this page.
  4: Uses a damage function to gauge economic losses from worsening climate conditions.
    Operationalizes the impact of tipping points using findings from Dietz et al.
    (2021) across different socioeconomic development and temperature change scenarios.
  5: Uses SSPs, RCPs, and IFs to model economic production, income distribution, and
    population change for 175 countries from 2017 to 2070; uses RCP temperature trajectories
    to measure median temperature change relative to pre-industrial levels on a country
    basis using a 10-year moving average; introduces damage functions and tipping
    points to capture the impacts of climate change on overall economic activity;
    creates alternative versions of SSP scenarios to reflect economic and inequality
    effects; uses the IFs poverty module.
  7: The analysis uses the International Futures (IFs) model, a six-sector general
    equilibrium model, to simulate economic production, consumption, and poverty rates
    under different climate scenarios. The model incorporates socioeconomic development
    pathways (SSPs) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs). The IFs model
    simulates annual time steps toward equilibrium but doesn't fully reach it.
  9: Uses the DICE model damage function. Scenarios based on IFs and SSP/RCP combinations.
  10: The analysis uses SSP and RCP scenarios to model the impact of climate change
    on global poverty through time. Results are applicable to 2030, 2050, and 2070.
  11: Uses IFs model with various SSP and RCP scenarios to project poverty increases
    attributable to climate change. Results are shown for 2030, 2050, and 2070.
  12: The IFs-RCP model is used to assess the impact of RCP scenarios and tipping
    points. Sensitivity analysis was performed by exogenously changing the Gini coefficient
    for income inequality.
  13: Analysis of the impact of climate change on poverty across different countries
    and income thresholds using established macro-level relationships. Analysis looks
    further into the future, shows results at the country level and across income
    thresholds, and presents a comprehensive range of SSP-RCP combinations helping
    to inform thinking about the relationship between economic development, climate
    change, and poverty.
  15: Uses the IFs (International Futures) software platform. Replication instructions
    are available online.
More Notes:
  1: The paper acknowledges the tension between fossil fuel-based economic development
    and climate change. It considers the impact of income inequality on poverty mitigation.
  11: The analysis also considers the potential impact of tipping points on poverty
    levels. Table 5 and Fig 5 are mentioned, but not included in the excerpt.
  15: The authors acknowledge that human development requires energy and damages the
    environment, necessitating a dual focus on socioeconomic development and environmental
    consequences.

    page.
  4: SCC will increase by about 25% by 2100 if all tipping points are surpassed.
  5: "A 1% increase in temperature raises the Gini coefficient for income inequality\
    \ by 0.5 points on a 0\u2013100-point scale."
  7: RCP 2.6 projects an average global temperature of 20.6 degrees Celsius by 2070,
    RCP 4.5 projects 21.4 degrees, RCP 6.0 projects 21.3 degrees, and RCP 8.5 projects
    22.4 degrees by 2070.
  8: SSP1 and SSP5 reflect global populations that are declining by 2070.
  9: 'Table 2: Projected reductions in global economic growth in cumulative trillions
    of 2011 US$ and percent terms for 2030, 2050, and 2070 under various climate scenarios
    (IFs-RCP 6.0, SSP1-RCP 2.6, SSP2-RCP 4.5, SSP3-RCP 6.0, SSP4-RCP 6.0, SSP5-RCP
    8.5). Table 3: Projected changes in global Gini coefficient on a 0-1 scale in
    absolute terms and percent change for 2030, 2050, and 2070 under the same climate
    scenarios.'
  10: By 2030, climate change is projected to push an additional 18-30 million people
    into extreme poverty. SSP1-RCP 2.6 projects an increase of 9 million people in
    poverty by 2050 and 4 million by 2070. SSP3-RCP 6.0 projects increases of 30 million
    by 2030, 78 million by 2050, and 130 million by 2070. SSP5-RCP 8.5 projects increases
    of 24 million by 2030, 20 million by 2050, and 39 million by 2070.
  11: Table 4 presents the effect of climate on poverty in millions of people in 2030,
    2050, and 2070 for different poverty thresholds and scenarios. Fig 4 shows the
    climate-attributable percentage of the impoverished population across poverty
    thresholds ($1.90, $3.20, $5.50).
  12: Table 5 shows cumulative effect of tipping points on global GDP (in trillions
    of 2011 US$) for various scenarios (IFs-RCP 6.0, SSP1-RCP 2.6, SSP2-RCP 4.5, SSP3-RCP
    6.0, SSP4-RCP 6.0, SSP5-RCP 8.5) in 2030, 2050, and 2070.  Fig 5 shows climate-attributable
    poverty in millions for extreme, poverty, and moderate poverty under these scenarios
    for 2017-2069.
  13: In the more extreme climate scenario of RCP 8.5, a fifteen percent reduction
    in income inequality would be necessary to offset poverty increases. Extreme poverty
    would be approximately ten percent globally.
  15: SSP2-RCP 4.5 leads to an additional 40 million people in extreme poverty by
    2050 relative to a world without climate change.
