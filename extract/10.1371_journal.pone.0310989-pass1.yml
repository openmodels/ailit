Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (CO2 and methane emissions).
  2: Climate change (variations in rainfall, drought, flooding, warmer/cooler temperatures);
    Greenhouse gas emissions; depletion of water resources; climate variability.
  4: Climate change, technological inefficiency, agricultural methane emissions, CO2
    emissions.
  5: Climate change, random shocks (unfavorable weather, measurement errors, variable
    omissions)
  6: Climate change (CO2 emissions and methane emissions)
  7: Rain-fed agriculture and subsistence orientation leading to low and unpredictable
    growth rates in cereal production.
  8: Insufficient investment in farm-level research, harsh geographical conditions,
    and disputes.
  9: Climate change (inferred from CO2 emissions as a proxy), inefficient use of inputs
    (labor, capital, technology), decline in crop productivity, effects of labor,
    land and fertilizer use.
  10: Climate change impacts agriculture in underdeveloped nations, with smallholder
    farmers having limited capacity to adapt. Excessive heat deteriorates agricultural
    input productivity. Lack of innovation and slow adoption of technology in the
    agriculture sector decrease productivity.
  11: Climate change (proxied by agricultural methane and CO2 emissions), temperature
    increases, CO2 concentration.
  12: Agricultural methane and CO2 emissions negatively impact land and fertilizer
    productivity.
  13: Climate change (flooding, corrosive rain, severe weather), land fragmentation,
    small farm sizes.
  14: Climate change (acidic rainfall, flooding, land erosion) negatively impacts
    land, labor, and fertilizer productivity.
  15: CO2 and agricultural methane emissions reduce labour, land, and fertilizer productivity.

Highlights:
  1: The study estimates the technical efficiency of cereal crop yields and investigates
    the impacts of climate change on agricultural factor productivity in sub-Saharan
    African countries. Climate change diminishes land, labour, and fertilizers productivity.
  2: By 2050, climate change will offset the improvements in agricultural productivity
    and its contribution to GDP in Africa.
  4: Climate change impacts agricultural factor productivity and cereal crop yields.
    Africa is predicted to miss out on around 62% of its agricultural potential due
    to technological inefficiency.
  6: Examines factors affecting household level inefficiency/efficiency score; Examines
    impacts of climate change on agriculture factor productivity
  7: Countries with cereal yields above 1100 kg/hectare have a production efficiency
    score of 60% or higher; countries can achieve 60-90% efficiency with yields of
    1100-1600 kg/hectare.
  8: Technology expansion and CO2's contrasting effects on cereal yields in sub-Saharan
    Africa from 2005 to 2020.
  9: South Africa's carbon emissions are disproportionately high in relation to its
    cereal crop yields. The region has an average minimum technical efficiency score
    of 0.683 and a maximum of 0.994, indicating high technological efficiency. Worker
    productivity in SSA agriculture declined by an average of 1% per year from 1960
    to 1991. Cereal crop productivity dropped between 2008 and 2019.
  10: Fertilizer adoption contributed the most to the growth of cereal crop yields
    in Sub-Saharan African countries from 2005-2020. Expanding harvested area diminished
    average returns on cereal crop yields. Land and labor inputs had virtually no
    impact on cereal crop yields.
  11: Agricultural methane and CO2 emissions have a harmful impact on agricultural
    factor productivity in sub-Saharan African nations. CO2 emissions reduce household
    welfare and agricultural output. Temperature increases reduce TFP growth rates
    in poorer nations.
  12: Climate change has an adverse impact on fertilizer productivity and cereal yields;
    GDP per capita income positively influences land productivity.
  13: GDP per capita income has a favorable and statistically significant impact on
    arable land productivity, labour productivity, and fertilizer productivity.  Arable
    land, labor supply, and fertilizer adoption elasticity are also derived.
  14: Climate change adversely affects agricultural input productivity in Sub-Saharan
    Africa. Labor and fertilizer contribute to the technical efficiency of agricultural
    crops, but land size has a negative impact.
  15: CO2 and agricultural methane emissions negatively impact productivity, but GDP
    per capita increases factor productivity, likely offsetting some of these negative
    effects.

More Notes:
  2: The paper discusses the impact of climate change on food security and agricultural
    productivity, particularly in Africa. It also mentions climate-smart agriculture
    as a potential adaptation strategy.
  4: The study focuses on the production of wheat, rice, maize, barley, oats, rye,
    millet, sorghum, and buckwheat.
  5: Ethics approval and consent to participate section indicates the study does not
    contain any studies with human participants performed by the authors. The paper
    uses specific equations (Eqs 1, 2, 3, and 4) to model cereal yields and technical
    efficiency. Specific efficiency studies benefit from SFA, especially when influenced
    by situations beyond the decision-making unit's control.
  6: v, k, l & x are value add, land, and fertilizer per labor ratio, respectively;
    'Ait' is inputs productivity (labor, land, and fertilizer inputs); 'y_it' represents
    the ith countries cereal yield at time t; 'x_it' is the ith countries inputs (labor,
    land and fertilizer) at time t; l_it is land productivity, la_it is labor productivity,
    fe_it is fertilizer consumption productivity.
  7: The paper suggests that combining agriculture with high technological adoption
    can increase productivity and reduce malnutrition in the region.
  8: High carbon emissions in some countries linked with lower cereal crop yields.
  9: The paper utilizes STATA 17 for computation and includes a figure (Fig 3) visually
    comparing CO2 emissions and cereal yields in Sub-Saharan African countries from
    1960-2020.
  10: The paper includes a bar chart showing the average efficiency scores for cereal
    crop yields in various Sub-Saharan African countries, with scores generally between
    0.8 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient is used as a unit of measurement to calculate
    the intensity of the linear relationship between variables.
  11: The study verifies the absence of autocorrelations and constant variance in
    the panel data. Growth of agricultural output enhances the climate by reducing
    greenhouse emissions. Land productivity diminishes when the annual average maximum
    temperature rises and is positively associated with irrigation area, pump set
    number, and fertilizer application.
  13: The study uses nationwide plot-level data and focuses on sub-Saharan African
    agriculture.
  14: Increased land size can cause farmers to deprioritize adopting new technologies
    and proper land management. Skilled labor is necessary to embrace new harvesting
    methods. Rising GDP per capita income boosts agricultural input productivity.
  15: The study focuses on the relationship between climate change, agricultural productivity,
    and economic outcomes. The study is limited by data availability, not including
    all sub-Saharan African countries or variables like improved seed and mechanical
    technology.
  19: The listed papers primarily focus on agricultural productivity, technical efficiency,
    climate change impacts on crop production, and adaptation strategies at the farm
    or regional level rather than providing nation-wide macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    assessments. Some studies consider the role of climate variables or emissions
    as drivers, and use econometric or meta-analysis methodologies.
