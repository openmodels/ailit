Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change impacts in other regions, cross-border transmission of impacts,
    and EU responses to climate change.
  4: Climate change impacts occurring in a remote region can have indirect cascading
    effects across borders.
  5: The paper focuses on trade-related risks from climate change, specifically trade
    of agricultural and non-agricultural commodities and infrastructure/transport.
  6: Climate change impacts in certain geographic regions could have an 'outsize'
    impact on the sourcing of important materials, potentially disrupting trade.
  7: Climate change impacts on agriculture, fisheries, and pastoralism due to rising
    temperatures, temperature shocks, and extreme weather.
  10: Climate change has the potential to aggravate humanitarian and political crises,
    leading to forced displacements and migration.
  13: Cross-border climate impacts on the EU financial sector due to high exposure
    to portfolio investments in various global regions are a driver of risk.
  14: Lack of rainfall and droughts in Argentina and Brazil & Paraguay leading to
    soy production collapse.
  15: Extreme drought in Argentina, slow technological progress, degraded environments,
    high global soy consumption, lack of financial investment in Argentina, protectionism,
    panic-buying effects
Highlights:
  2: "Risk is likely to be focused in particular \u2018hotspots\u2019; defined geographies,\
    \ for example, that produce materials for EU consumption (e.g. Latin American\
    \ soybean), hold financial investments (e.g. North America), or are the foci for\
    \ EU external action (e.g. the Middle East and North Africa region)."
  5: The EU has a higher than average exposure to climate risks due to its high trade
    openness. Climate-induced changes in global food prices are important for Europe,
    as it relies on imports. Trade may help alleviate the impacts of climate change
    by balancing agricultural production gains and losses across regions, but its
    effectiveness as an adaptation mechanism should be critically considered. Policies
    to protect national interests alone may cause negative impacts on a global scale.
  6: The EU27 is highly import-dependent for fertilizers and fossil fuels; Products
    of horticulture, oilseeds and cereals are likely to be nutritionally important
    to the EU; Imports are concentrated from five or fewer (sometimes geographically
    co-located) countries for bulk commodities like soybeans, palm oil, and maize.
  7: Identifies maritime trade via ports in the Netherlands and Belgium (Rotterdam,
    Antwerp) as particularly important for material dependency in the EU27, with Rotterdam
    handling significantly more material than other ports. The Black Sea region requires
    significant transport infrastructure investment but is deterred by regional instability.
    Agriculture, fisheries, and pastoralism face significant challenges due to changing
    climatic conditions.
  10: Humanitarian and political crises may affect migration to Europe more if they
    erupt in the immediate European neighbourhood.
  13: The EU financial sector is particularly exposed to climate risks via portfolio
    investments, potentially leading to amplified losses and systemic risk.
  14: Climate-related shocks in one region (Argentina, Brazil & Paraguay) can cascade
    globally, impacting food prices, trade, and investment patterns in regions like
    the US, EU, and MENA.
  15: Climate shocks can lead to cascading impacts across multiple domains (supply
    chains, financial interests, foreign policy, and human security) with eventual
    risks to the EU linked to human security and downstream financial concerns.
Methodology:
  2: Macro-scale, risk-focused literature and data review to explore potential impact
    transmission pathways between the EU and other world regions.
  4: The paper uses an integrative literature review and data analysis across trade,
    human security, and finance domains. The literature review includes repositories
    specific to social and economic sciences, and data analysis focuses primarily
    on EU-linked connections. Data sources include Chatham House, UN Comtrade, FAO,
    Eurostat, United Nations, OECD, and IMF.
  5: The paper explores pathways of climate change risk transmission in Europe, focusing
    on trade. The methodology is a review and synthesis of existing literature. The
    applicability of the results is focused on Europe.
  10: Analysis suggests that migratory movements to the EU27 correlate strongly with
    total migration stock data (see SI3.2), and somewhat strongly with the mobility
    patterns of refugees and asylum seekers
  14: Conceptual framework using impact and response transmission pathways, applied
    to a potential future drought scenario inspired by SSP3.
  15: Scenario-based thought experiment using SSP3 'Regional Rivalry - A Rocky Road'
    for the year 2050
More Notes:
  4: The research focuses on cross-border climate risk exposure relevant to the EU.
  5: The paper emphasizes the importance of harmonized trade policies and equity considerations,
    as poorer nations are least able to adapt to evolving risk under climate change.
  6: The paper identifies the importance of maritime routes for EU trade, which are
    vulnerable to climate change disruptions.
  7: The analysis focuses on the EU27, identifying key vulnerabilities in material
    supply chains and potential risks to human security (food supply) from climate-related
    disruptions. The relative importance of imports and domestic production varies
    considerably across sectors (agricultural products, fertilizers, forestry products,
    fossil fuels, metals and minerals).
  10: The largest sums [of ODA] have flowed to countries from which larger migrant
    populations within the EU originate, pointing to a connection between international
    development cooperation and diasporic ties.
  14: The impact transmission system involves interconnected system components, resulting
    in recipient risks in other regions. Adaptive responses occur via a response transmission
    system.
  15: The scenario highlights the importance of considering interactions between domains
    and connections within them when assessing cross-border impacts of climate change.

    the importance of understanding these for policy responses, but it doesn't provide
    quantitative information on macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, nor does it
    offer a methodology. It primarily discusses the domains of trade, human security,
    and finance as potential sources of risk for Europe.
