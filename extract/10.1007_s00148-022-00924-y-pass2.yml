Drivers of Risk:
  2: Higher temperatures (global warming)
  3: Global warming (persistent increases in temperature)
  4: Increasing temperatures (global warming).
  7: Increasing temperatures due to global warming.
  9: Increasing temperatures and global warming influencing urbanization, especially
    impacted by country's dependence on agriculture and presence of urban bias.
  10: Global warming (temperature increases) and urbanization.
  12: Positive trend in urbanization and temperature increases, linked to global warming.
  13: Cross-sectional dependence in urbanization and temperature data due to common
    shocks or spillover effects, such as regional climate phenomena or economic/political
    crises.
  15: Global warming leading to persistent reductions in agricultural activity.
  16: Temperature increases
  18: Global warming, urbanization.
  20: Temperature changes (global warming).
  21: Temperature (T) and urbanization (U).
  22: Increases in temperature (global warming)
  23: Temperature.
  25: Temperature increases due to climate change
  26: Temperature, Precipitation, Cloud cover, Ground frost, Potential evapotranspiration
  28: Temperature increases are the primary driver of risk investigated in relation
    to urbanization.
  31: Initial temperature, initial urbanization, initial GDP p.c., initial employment
    in agriculture, initial urban bias, cluster conditions.
  33: Temperature changes (global warming)
  34: Increasing temperatures (global warming), adverse initial conditions (poverty,
    dependence on agriculture, urban bias).
Highlights:
  2: Higher temperatures correlate with higher urbanization rates in the long run,
    especially in poorer and more agriculture-dependent countries with an urban bias,
    and in initially non-urban countries in hotter climate zones.
  3: "Higher temperatures are related to higher urbanization rates (and thus rural\u2013\
    urban migration) in the long run. The relationship between global warming and\
    \ urbanization is particularly relevant to countries characterized by relative\
    \ economic and institutional underdevelopment and strong dependence on agriculture.\
    \ Warming contributes to losses in agricultural productivity and pro-urban shifts\
    \ in public goods provision. Global warming promotes migration both by contributing\
    \ to poorer rural conditions (e.g., by adversely affecting agricultural production\
    \ and wages) and an increased relative attractiveness of urban centers (e.g.,\
    \ by increasing demand for public goods primarily provided in cities)."
  4: The study differentiates between short-run and long-run linkages between global
    warming and urbanization and identifies heterogeneous linkages governed by country-specific
    mediators (economic development, manufacturing sector role, dependence on agriculture,
    agricultural policies, initial urban bias).
  7: Increasing temperatures may lead to lower levels of urbanization. The relationship
    between temperature increases and urbanization is expected to be stronger in the
    long run than in the short run.
  12: The paper finds a clear positive trend in urbanization rates and temperature
    increases from 1960 to 2016, linking these trends to urbanization pressures and
    climate change.
  13: Temperatures and urbanization rates are strongly indicated to be affected by
    cross-sectional dependence, necessitating robust econometric methods in subsequent
    analysis.
  14: Urbanization rates and temperature exhibit long-run positive trends. All data
    series are non-stationary in levels but become stationary after the first-difference
    is taken (I(1) behavior).
  15: The study investigates whether urbanization and global warming are cointegrated,
    suggesting a long-run equilibrium relationship.
  16: Higher temperatures are usually associated with lower urbanization levels, particularly
    in low-income countries. This is possibly due to liquidity constraints, where
    warming reduces agricultural income, trapping populations in rural areas.
  18: The coefficient estimates for the impact of global warming and urbanization
    are statistically significant in many specifications (indicated by asterisks).
    The dependent variable is unclear, but the negative coefficients suggest a detrimental
    impact.
  20: Higher temperatures are associated with less urbanization in the short run.
  21: Temperature has a negative effect on the outcome, while urbanization has a positive
    effect. All the included coefficients are statistically significant (p<0.01) unless
    otherwise specified.
  22: Increases in temperature are linked to more urbanization in the long run; the
    long-run association between increasing temperatures on urbanization is much more
    pronounced than the short-run one.
  23: Higher temperatures are associated with less urbanization in the short run,
    but higher temperatures are associated with higher levels of urbanization in the
    long run. This result is robust to various alternative specifications.
  25: The effect of climate change on urbanization primarily emerges via increasing
    temperatures.
  26: Temperature has a statistically significant negative impact on urbanization
    in the short run and a positive statistically significant impact in the long run.
    The effect of agro-climatic variables on urbanization is mixed, with some variables
    having a positive effect and others having a negative effect.
  28: Increases in temperature are related to higher levels of urbanization, especially
    in the long run. This relationship may be different depending on country-specific
    conditions, such as initial temperature, urbanization, poverty, and agricultural
    dependence.
  31: Initial temperature, initial urbanization, initial GDP p.c., initial employment
    in agriculture, initial urban bias and cluster conditions all significantly affect
    subsequent urbanization rates.
  33: A long-run positive relationship exists between warming and urbanization, especially
    in countries with unfavorable initial conditions (non-urban, hotter climates,
    poorer, agriculture-dependent, institutions favoring urban centers).
  34: Increasing temperatures may fuel urbanization to a dangerous extent in countries
    lacking capacity to absorb rural-urban migration.
Methodology:
  2: Panel vector error correction models are used to analyze the relationship between
    global warming and urbanization.
  3: "Country-level data on temperature for 118 countries between 1960 and 2016 linked\
    \ to national urbanization rates. The analysis uses a push\u2013pull model of\
    \ internal migration."
  4: The study employs statistical tests and econometric methods, including panel
    vector error correction models with dynamic fixed-effects estimators, to analyze
    short-run and long-run linkages between global warming and urbanization.
  9: Analysis performed with data on climate and urbanization from 118 countries for
    the period 1960-2016 using panel methods that require a fully balanced panel.
  10: The paper uses panel data analysis covering approximately 90% of the world population
    between 1960 and 2016 to study the relationship between urbanization and temperature.
  12: The analysis uses country-level urbanization data and climate data averaged
    from weather stations, spatially aggregated to the country level, with a focus
    on linear trends over time (1960-2016).
  13: The analysis detects cross-sectional dependence using bias-adjusted LM test
    of Pesaran et al. (2008) and test for weak cross-sectional dependence of Pesaran
    (2015) to identify correlation between countries.
  14: Panel unit root tests developed by Pesaran (2007), Herwartz and Siedenburg (2008),
    and Demetrescu and Hanck (2012) are used to test for unit roots in urbanization
    and temperature data. Tests for panel cointegration are performed. These tests
    are robust to cross-sectional dependence and serial correlation. The latter two
    tests are also robust to heteroskedasticity.
  15: Panel unit root tests (CADF, HS, DH) are used to test for stationarity of urbanization
    and temperature data. Panel cointegration tests (Kao, Pedroni, Westerlund) are
    used to examine the long-run relationship (cointegration) between urbanization
    and temperature, controlling for other factors.
  16: Panel cointegration tests and fixed-effects regressions are used to estimate
    the relationship between temperature increases and urbanization. The fixed-effects
    model includes country- and year-fixed effects.
  18: Fixed effects regressions are used with various control variables and dummy
    variables. Driscoll-Kray standard errors are employed in some specifications.
    ADF tests are mentioned. Sample sizes vary across specifications, around 608-760.
    Dummies for year, regional effects, low-income countries (LI), and middle-income
    countries (MI) are included.
  20: Panel vector error correction model to analyze the relationship between urbanization
    and temperature, accounting for cross-sectional dependence, non-stationarity,
    and cointegration.
  21: The analysis uses dynamic fixed-effects estimation, including short-run and
    long-run estimates. It uses panel data with several control variables. It also
    includes ADF tests and FWNCD tests.
  22: Uses a model (cointegration relationship) to assess the long-run and short-run
    association between temperature and urbanization; examines selection bias using
    Oster (2019) to assess omitted variable bias.
  23: Regression analysis with robustness checks including additional controls, alternative
    variable measurements, and lagged variables. Baseline model modified to include
    variants. Models include first differenced variables. Temperature is weighted
    by population size or agricultural land. Dependent variable measurement includes
    logged urbanization rate and (logged) total urban population.
  25: "Panel vector error correction models with pooled mean-group estimator. They\
    \ also dropped countries with average urbanization rate larger than 67%, average\
    \ temperature above 25.2 \xB0C, and OECD members before 1990."
  26: 'Dynamic fixed-effects panel vector error correction models, pooled mean-group
    and mean-group estimators.  Short-run coefficients can vary between countries,
    while restricting long-run coefficients to be equal across countries. Driscoll-Kraay
    standard errors used. Data: 6490 observations.'
  28: The analysis uses panel data and IV-models to examine the relationship between
    urbanization and temperature. The paper uses the share of young males as an instrument
    for urbanization. Conditional effects are studied by dividing the sample based
    on initial temperatures, urbanization rates, poverty levels, and agricultural
    dependence.
  31: The analysis uses dynamic fixed-effects models and two-step system GMM (Generalized
    Method of Moments) to estimate the impact of various initial conditions on urbanization.
    Models in short-run and long-run.
  33: Dynamic fixed-effects estimates; mediation analysis; error correction model
    (first lag of dependent variable); short-run specification with l=1. Addresses
    cross-sectional dependence, non-stationarity, and cointegration.
More Notes:
  2: The global warming-urbanization nexus is partly mediated through losses in agricultural
    productivity and to pro-urban shifts in public goods provision.
  3: The analysis suggests that countries that are less adaptive and more vulnerable
    to global warming are those characterized by relative economic and institutional
    underdevelopment and strong dependence on agriculture. The relationship between
    global warming and urbanization matters more strongly to initially non-urban countries
    in hotter climate zones.
  4: The paper explores potential transmission channels, including the undermining
    of agricultural productivity and stronger differences in the provision of public
    goods between urban and rural areas, due to rising temperatures.
  10: The analysis focuses on the period after 1960 due to data availability. The
    paper acknowledges limitations in studying the pre-industrial relationship between
    temperature and urbanization.
  14: The study addresses the spurious regression problem that may arise when using
    non-stationary variables.
  16: The paper addresses concerns about cross-sectional dependence in regression
    residuals.
  18: The exact meaning of variables F, A, and Dr is not explicitly defined on this
    page, making it difficult to interpret the results fully.
  20: The paper distinguishes between short-run and long-run relationships between
    temperature and urbanization. The analysis focuses on the dynamics between these
    variables.
  21: The page appears to show results from different model specifications, as indicated
    by columns (1), (2), and (3).
  22: The association between temperature and urbanization becomes less pronounced
    when additional controls are added to the model, suggesting omitted variables
    may partially account for the association or that some covariates mediate the
    association; selection on unobservables would need to be significantly stronger
    than selection on observables to eliminate the long-run association between temperature
    and urbanization.
  25: The paper finds a positive long-run association between temperature and urbanization.
    The paper also controls for precipitation, cloud cover, ground frost frequency
    and potential evapotranspiration.
  26: 'Further controls included: population size; GDP p.c.; democracy; youth dependency
    ratio; education equality. Results are similar across different estimation methods.'
  28: The paper investigates both the effect of temperature on urbanization and the
    potential reverse causality of urbanization on temperature. The study acknowledges
    potential endogeneity issues and attempts to address them using instrumental variable
    techniques. Results concerning reverse causality are considered suggestive rather
    than definitive.
  31: The table includes interaction terms to explore how the effect of initial conditions
    changes depending on the level of modernization. Control variables enter all specifications.
  33: The moderator variable represents poor starting conditions based on cluster
    analysis. Further controls include population size, GDP per capita, and democracy.
    The analysis uses data from 118 countries between 1960 and 2016.
  34: The paper suggests that the relationship between increasing temperatures and
    urbanization may be an eventual blessing in disguise if urbanization leads to
    economic growth and development, but the authors point out that this is not always
    the case and is particularly problematic in countries experiencing urbanization
    without growth.

  17: This page appears to present statistical results from panel data analysis, likely
    related to testing for cointegration between variables, but the variables themselves
    are heavily obscured by formatting errors. Without clear identification of the
    variables, it is impossible to determine their relevance to macroeconomic/fiscal
    risks of climate change or adaptation costs/benefits.
