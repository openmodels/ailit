Drivers of Risk:
  1: 1970 cyclone in Bangladesh
  3: 1970 cyclone in Bangladesh.
  4: The 1970 cyclone and its long-term impacts on households across different regions
    of Bangladesh.
  7: Severe monsoon floods (1974), crop damage, market failures and price speculation
    in the food-grains market.
  11: Exposure to the 1970 cyclone
  15: Exposure to disasters, rural vs urban location, lack of adequate healthcare
    and schooling facilities.
  22: Cyclones in two regions (Cyclone Region 1, Cyclone Region 2).
  23: Exposure to the 1970 cyclone and interaction with cohort and region.
  24: Impacts of cyclones on health, schooling, and consumption outcomes.
  25: "Cyclone Cohort \xD7 Cyclone Region 1; Cyclone Cohort \xD7 Cyclone Region 2"
  27: "Placebo Cyclone Cohort \xD7 Cyclone Region impacts on health, schooling, and\
    \ consumption outcomes."
  28: Natural disasters such as cyclones significantly impact rice production in Bangladesh.
  29: Cyclone regions (CR0, CR1, CR2), possibly a significant event or change around
    1973
  35: Drought, Earthquake (Ground Movement, Tsunami), Epidemic (Uncategorized, Bacterial,
    Parasitic, Viral), Extreme Temperature (Cold wave, Heat Wave, Severe Winter Conditions),
    Flood (Uncategorized, Coastal, Flash, Riverine), Landslide (Landslide, Mudslide),
    Storm (Uncategorized, Convective, Tropical Cyclone).
Highlights:
  1: Children surviving the cyclone experience significant health, schooling and consumption
    adversities, and during their adulthood, have lower probabilities of good health
    and primary schooling; and lower durations of good health, schooling and consumption.
    Such adversities are further heightened among the rural and less-educated households.
  3: This paper studies the long-term health, schooling and consumption impacts of
    the 1970 cyclone in Bangladesh on children who experienced it.
  4: Rural poor households experience long-term adversities from childhood exposure
    to a disaster, which can be mitigated by education and infrastructural development
    programs.
  6: The 1970 cyclone resulted in widespread loss of life and property in coastal
    regions of Noakhali and Barisal. In Tazumuddin subdivision, Barisal nearly 47%
    of the total population died, and all standing rice crops were destroyed
  11: "Parameters \U0001D6FD\U0001D457 allow for differential effects of regions on\
    \ cyclone cohorts, with the hypothesis that \U0001D6FD\u03022 < \U0001D6FD\u0302\
    1 < 0, indicating regional variations in outcomes controlling for permanent differences."
  15: Rural households experience additional adversities, especially in schooling
    outcomes, after disaster exposure, highlighting the importance of infrastructural
    development as an adaptation policy. Parental education does not appear to have
    a mitigating effect, possibly due to low levels of parental education in the sample.
  22: The table primarily serves to assess the parallel trends assumption, and is
    restricted to corresponding estimating samples for results shown in another Table
    (Table 3).
  23: Cyclone Region 2 shows statistically significant negative impacts on health,
    schooling, and consumption outcomes for Cyclone Cohort.
  24: Cyclones have statistically significant impacts on health and schooling outcomes
    based on locational and parental schooling variations.
  25: There is a statistically significant impact from the interaction of Cyclone
    Cohort and Cyclone Region on health (Ln(Health)), with positive effects at the
    75th percentile of the distribution.
  27: "Statistically significant impacts in Placebo Cyclone Cohort \xD7 Cyclone Region\
    \ 2, notably for schooling and consumption outcomes with positive coefficients."
  28: The Bhola cyclone in the early 1970s coincides with significant dips in rice
    production and high casualties.
  29: The graphs compare the trends of health, education, solvency, and expenditure
    (and their natural logarithms) across three cyclone regions (CR0, CR1, CR2) from
    1965 to 1980. A vertical dashed line around 1973 suggests a significant event
    might have impacted these trends.
  35: Provides a breakdown of disasters in Bangladesh from 1900-2019, quantifying
    the number of events, deaths, affected population, and damage for various disaster
    subtypes.
  39: Cyclone exposure is negatively associated with various outcomes for some demographic/geographic
    intersections and positively associated with outcomes for others. The negative
    impact of cyclone exposure is often exacerbated by rural location. War and famine
    cohorts also show varying impacts across outcomes and regions.
Methodology:
  1: Uses childhood exposures to disasters as natural experiments inducing variations
    in adulthood outcomes; Employs a unique dataset from Bangladesh
  3: Difference-in-difference method using Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure
    Survey (HIES) dataset.
  4: The analysis controls for overlapping events such as the 1971 war and the 1974
    famine to isolate the net long-term effects of the 1970 cyclone.
  6: No relevant information
  11: Regression analysis with fixed effects (birthyear, birthplace, survey year).
    Standard errors are clustered at the district level.
  15: Statistical analysis comparing outcomes based on rural/urban location and parental
    education, and impact of disaster exposure.
  22: "The paper uses a regression analysis (\U0001D466\U0001D456 = \U0001D6FC0 +\
    \ \u2211(\U0001D717\U0001D457\U0001D445\U0001D457) + \U0001D716\U0001D456) to\
    \ investigate the parallel trends assumption for untreated/control cyclone cohorts.\
    \ Standard errors are clustered at the district level. Statistical significance\
    \ is indicated at 1%, 5%, and 10% levels."
  23: Estimation of long-term impacts using regression analysis with standard errors
    clustered at the district level, considering control variables and fixed effects.
  24: Analysis uses an empirical specification with interaction terms, and standard
    errors are clustered at the district level.
  25: Regressions are based on empirical specification (2). Control variables, Year
    FE, Thana FE, and HIES FE are included. Statistical significance is indicated
    by *, **, and *** for 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.
  27: Placebo regressions with controls and fixed effects, excluding specific variables
    due to data unavailability.
  29: Comparison of trends over time (1965-1980) for different variables across three
    cyclone regions.
  35: Data is extracted from the EM-DAT database on April 28, 2020, covering events
    from 1900-2019.
  39: The analysis uses regression models (specifically equation 4 from the paper)
    with individual-level data, including year, Thana (police precinct), and HIES
    (Household Income and Expenditure Survey) fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered
    at the district level. Significance levels are indicated (*, **, *** for 10%,
    5%, and 1% respectively). The analysis extends an empirical specification to include
    additional interaction for location.
