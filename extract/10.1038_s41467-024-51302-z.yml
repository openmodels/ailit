Drivers of Risk:
  7: Climate change scenarios (RCP6.0 vs RCP2.6) and population scenarios (SSP3 vs
    SSP2) are the primary drivers of risk, affecting water availability and scarcity.
Highlights:
  7: High population growth (SSP3) can significantly aggravate water scarcity, leading
    to advanced FirstWS and delayed EndWS. Future global water availability is greater
    in the high emission scenario (RCP6.0) than in the low emission scenario (RCP2.6).
More Notes:
  7: The impact of climate and population changes on water scarcity varies significantly
    across regions and countries.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  7: The paper assesses the impact of climate change and population scenarios on water
    scarcity, which can be linked to macroeconomic outcomes through impacts on agriculture,
    industry, and public health.
Quantitative material:
  7: The paper presents quantitative data on the areas (million km2) experiencing
    advanced or delayed water scarcity (FirstWS and EndWS) under different climate
    and population scenarios. For example, Fig 5a shows the area affected by changes
    to FirstWS under RCP6.0 compared to RCP2.6.
