  12: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: As climatic changes occur, these benefits or ecosystem services may be significantly
    reduced
  2: Climate-related changes such as ocean warming, deoxygenation, acidification,
    coastal flooding, droughts, rising seas, and extreme weather impact oceans and
    coasts, subsequently affecting communities dependent on them.
  5: Climate change is impacting ecosystem services, indicating shifts in ocean temperatures
    and marine species' geographic ranges.
  9: Ocean acidification (OA), caused by increases in atmospheric CO2, leading to
    declines in aragonite saturation state.
  12: Climate change impacts on US ocean and coastal ecosystems, including sea-level
    rise, fishery species range shifts due to increasing sea surface temperature and
    ocean acidification.

    conditions; Climate disruption
Highlights:
  1: U.S. ocean and coastal ecosystems are a significant contributor to the national
    economy, but these contributions are at risk from climatic changes.
  5: Climate change may necessitate updates to fishery management practices and implementation
    of mitigation/adaptation activities.
  12: Communities with high dependence on fishing and high social and/or high gentrification
    pressure vulnerability may be less resilient to the effects of climate change.
    Social well-being vulnerabilities that is traditionally dependent on climate-vulnerable
    species may be more affected by fishery species range shifts due to climate change.
  14: Climate change and ocean acidification can reduce the distribution and species
    diversity of coral reef ecosystems, impacting tourism; Vibrio outbreaks, linked
    to water temperature and salinity, affect human health and ecosystem services;
    Harmful algal blooms are increasing and impacting human and wildlife health; Marine
    mammal health can indicate overall ocean health and related public health risks;
    Shorebird populations are indicators of global change
Methodology:
  2: The page discusses the use of a set of indicators designed in collaboration with
    the U.S. National Climate Indicators System to track climate-related impacts on
    oceans and coasts.
  5: Identification of key points along the ecosystem services pathway to provide
    early warnings of climate change impacts, including the development of core criteria
    for indicator selection.
  12: The analysis uses community social well-being indicators (social vulnerability,
    gentrification pressure vulnerability, and fishing dependence) to assess the vulnerability
    of coastal communities to climate change. These indicators are constructed from
    NMFS landings data, NMFS recreational fishing effort data, and US Census data.
More Notes:
  14: The page focuses on the impact of climate change on coastal ecosystems and related
    human activities, highlighting the need for more data and monitoring programs.
No relevant information:
  13: This page focuses on the need for improved climate change indicators for ocean
    and coastal systems, but does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes, costs, or benefits of adaptation at a national level. It emphasizes
    the importance of monitoring, improving existing indicators, and developing new
    indicators, particularly for tracking climate impacts, risks, vulnerabilities,
    and preparedness in ocean and coastal systems. While it mentions potential impacts
    on subsistence fisheries, it does not quantify these impacts in macroeconomic
    or fiscal terms.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: The U.S. ocean and coastal ecosystems generate ~US 370 billion of U.S. gross
    domestic product, 617 billion in sales and 2.6 million jobs each year.
  2: Ocean and coastal ecosystems contribute approximately US$370 billion to US GDP,
    $617 billion in sales, and 2.6 million jobs each year.
  9: Communities where commercial or subsistence fishing depends largely on bivalves
    or crustaceans will be most heavily impacted.
  14: Economically valuable tourism industries; Value of ecosystem services provided
    by coastal ecosystems; Human health; Wildlife health; Public health risks; Sustainable
    development of coastal and ocean resources
Quantitative material:
  1: ~US 370 billion of U.S. gross domestic product, 617 billion in sales and 2.6
    million jobs each year are generated by ocean and coastal ecosystems.
  2: The monetary contribution of ocean and coastal ecosystems to US GDP and sales
    is quantified; US$370 billion in GDP and $617 billion in sales annually, supporting
    2.6 million jobs.
  14: No quantitative information on outcomes of interest is provided.
