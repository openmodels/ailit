Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climatic changes
  2: Ocean warming, deoxygenation, acidification, coastal flooding, droughts, rising
    seas, and extreme weather.
  5: Human activities resulting in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions influence the global
    climate system and exert substantial pressures on the ocean and coastal environment,
    including a rise in ocean temperatures.
  6: The paper discusses indicators related to ocean and coast regulatory services,
    such as global temperature regulation, circulation patterns, carbon capture, storm
    severity, and heat absorption, implying these are climate-related drivers of risk.
  9: Increases in atmospheric CO2 levels leading to ocean acidification and decreased
    aragonite saturation state.
  10: Changes in ocean temperature, climate change-related temperature increases,
    and ocean acidification
  12: Sea level rise, changes in fishery species range shifts due to climate change
    (e.g., increasing sea surface temperature, ocean acidification), and other aspects
    of climate change.
  13: Climate change altering the abundance and distribution of living marine resources
    harvested in subsistence fisheries; marine heatwaves.
  14: Climate change and ocean acidification (coral reefs); coastal water temperatures
    and salinity (Vibrio); environmental conditions (Harmful Algal Blooms); climate
    disruption (marine mammal morbidity and mortality); climate change (shorebird
    phenology and abundance); bottom temperature (ocean's heat storage).
  15: Climate change is the primary driver, impacting ocean and coastal ecosystems
    through changes to the ocean's mixed layer and bottom temperature, influencing
    biological communities, carbon dioxide absorption, and ocean acidification.

  19: Drivers include thermal stress, ocean acidification, sea-level rise, changing
    ocean conditions, interannual environmental forcing, and climate change impacts
    on species distributions.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Ecosystem services (subsistence food provisioning, health benefits, shoreline
    protection, climate regulation, conservation of marine biodiversity, and preservation
    of cultural heritage) may be significantly reduced as climatic changes occur.
  2: Long-term health of the marine environment and benefits to stakeholders who depend
    on marine ecosystem services.
  5: Highlights economic and cultural livelihoods through ocean-related jobs and activities.
  6: The paper evaluates indicators of climate-related changes to the ocean and coast,
    focusing on their ability to track large-scale changes to the marine environment
    and address ecosystem service categories.
  9: Discusses impacts of aragonite saturation state on ocean acidification's influence
    on marine species and ecosystems.
  10: "Impacts on ecosystem communities at local scales will differ, as a range shift\
    \ can represent a species\u2019 disappearance at one end of its range and introduction\
    \ at the other end; the spatial distances between the new stock range and the\
    \ fishing communities who target those species may change, affecting the costs\
    \ of fishing, social networks, and subculture cohesion."
  12: The page focuses on assessing and tracking social factors that affect a community's
    ability to cope with climate change, using indicators of social vulnerability,
    gentrification pressure vulnerability, and fishing dependence to understand community
    resilience.
  13: Climate change impacts on ocean and coastal systems, specifically the ability

    Prevalence of harmful algal blooms; Marine mammal morbidity and mortality; Shorebird
    phenology and abundance; Ocean's heat storage
  15: The paper focuses on the need for developing and tracking indicators of climate
    change impacts in ocean and coastal ecosystems and their services.
  16: No relevant information
  18: Lower pH causes declines in benthic species in southern regions, greatest economic
    impacts in northern regions.
  19: The papers on this page primarily evaluate vulnerability and resilience of fishing
    communities, impacts on marine organisms, and shifts in species distributions
    and productivity related to climate change.
Highlights:
  2: The authors discuss a set of indicators designed in close collaboration with
    the U.S. National Climate Indicators System to track climate impacts on the marine
    environment and sustain the benefits to stakeholders.
  5: Climate change may require updating fishery management practices as well as initiating
    activities designed to mitigate and/or adapt to climate stressors.
  6: The paper recommends indicators for climate-related changes to the ocean and
    coast for inclusion in the National Climate Indicator System (NCIS). Sea surface
    temperature, arctic sea ice extent, ocean chlorophyll concentration, and sea level
    rise were selected for the pilot NCIS. Five additional indicators were recommended
    but not adopted at that time. The paper highlights the importance of oceans and
    coasts for regulatory services.
  9: Exposure to acidified conditions can impact marine biodiversity, ecosystem structure,
    and economic activities like tourism and fisheries.
  10: Fish stock distributions change, the composition of ocean ecosystem communities
    also changes, thereby affecting predator/prey dynamics and competitive interactions.
  12: Communities with high dependence on fishing and high social and/or high gentrification
    pressure vulnerability may be less resilient to the effects of climate change.
  13: Need to improve existing indicators by reducing lags between data collection
    and indicator delivery, improving spatial and temporal representation, reducing
    costs of indicator production, identifying directionality and thresholds, ensuring
    measurable targets, and ensuring decision-makers have the tools and ability to
    use the information. Develop new indicators with strongly supported data streams
    that are designed to be integrated into existing and planned future management
    efforts.
  14: "Climate change will likely reduce the distribution and species diversity of\
    \ most coral reef ecosystems; Vibrio abundance is strongly linked to coastal water\
    \ temperatures and salinity, impacting the Clean Water Act's mandate; Harmful\
    \ algal blooms are becoming more prevalent in coastal areas; Marine mammals can\
    \ serve as effective sentinels for ecosystem change and emerging diseases; Shorebird\
    \ abundance and phenology are good integrators of global change; Tracking bottom\
    \ temperature is necessary for understanding the ocean\u2019s heat storage."

Methodology:
  2: This article describes indicators of ocean and coastal ecosystems that were identified
    in the US National Climate Indicator System process to help track climate-related
    processes and impacts.
  5: Identifies key points along the ecosystem services pathway that may be impacted
    by climate change and can provide an early warning of changes to come.
  6: The paper assesses existing literature to identify indicators that meet defined
    criteria, provide valuable information, and address ecosystem service categories.
    It also considers scalability, existing indicator efforts, and communication effectiveness.
  10: Using survey data, shifts can be measured as directional changes in range centroids.
  12: The analysis constructs social well-being indicators from NMFS landings data,
    NMFS recreational fishing effort data, and publicly available US Census data,
    as detailed in Jepson and Colburn (2013). The indicators are designed to be used
    in conjunction with community social vulnerability indicators.
  13: Monitoring and assessment of indicators over time and space to track trends,
    development of new analytical methods that enable links between climate changes
    and their impacts, or to improve consistency over space and continuity over time.
  14: Relies on data from existing networks, such as the NOAA National Marine Mammal
    Stranding Network, and state/academic monitoring programs. Suggests including
    HAB monitoring in the Integrated Ocean Observing System.
  15: The paper identifies a conceptual framework and initial suite of indicators
    to track climate change impacts in US ocean and coastal ecosystems, ranging from
    physical to biological to social and economic aspects. It emphasizes the need
    for long-term monitoring, synthesis, and delivery of data.
  16: No relevant information
  19: Methodologies include development of social indicators, ecosystem modeling,
    risk assessments, and analysis of historical data on ocean conditions and species
    distributions.
More Notes:
  2: The paper highlights the importance of ocean and coastal ecosystems to the US
    economy and the provision of essential services.
  5: The goal is to identify representative indicators that not only showed changes
    to specific services and benefits but also the linkages between regulating, supporting,
    provisioning, and cultural services.
  6: The selection criteria for indicators included their ability to track large-scale
    changes, address ecosystem service categories, inform natural resource management,
    and communicate climate impacts to various audiences. The pilot NCIS was in 2014.
  10: Coral thermal stress describes the occurrence, duration, and magnitude of high
    SST events that can result in coral bleaching, which can cause impairment or death
    of organisms and collapse of an important ecosystem; tracking this indicator may
    also provide advance warning of climate-related impacts to come.
  12: The indicators aim to identify vulnerable populations that may be less able
    to withstand and recover from climate change and socioeconomic impacts on coastal
    communities and ecosystems.
  13: Subsistence fisheries are identified as a potential area for new indicator development,
    but lack of data is a limitation.
  14: Data on social and economic indicators related to coral reef health are needed;
    Research and monitoring efforts are needed to directly measure or calculate Vibrio
    abundance in US coastal waters; Program needed to evaluate and establish robust
    methods for monitoring changes in frequency and spatial extent of HABs.
  15: The paper recommends increased commitment to long-term collection, synthesis,
    and delivery of physical, chemical, biological, social, and economic data for
    indicator systems. It also recommends continued support for tracking existing
    indicators and increased funding for developing new indicators.
