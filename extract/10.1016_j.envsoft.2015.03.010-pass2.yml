Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts, generic shocks in observed GDP series
  2: The persistence of climate shocks to GDP is related to long-term and short-term
    climate system dynamics and the response of natural and human systems.
  3: Climate change impacts, technological (productivity) shocks, general macroeconomic
    shocks, sector-specific shocks
  4: Climate change, large-scale discontinuity in the climate system, GDP shocks.
  5: Climate change damages (agriculture, sea level rise, other market sectors, human
    health, nonmarket amenity impacts, human settlements and ecosystems, and catastrophes),
    global temperature increase.
  6: Climate change impacts measured by temperature increases, shocks to investment.
  7: Climate change impacts given different values of persistence (denoted as 'a'),
    reflecting the persistence of shocks in GDP.
  8: Increase in global temperature, persistence of shocks to GDP due to climate change.
  9: Climate change impacts and their persistence and dynamics are the drivers.
  10: Climate change impacts treated as direct shocks to GDP.
Highlights:
  1: IAMs typically ignore the impact climate change could have on economic growth.
    The damage functions of these models assume that climate change impacts have no
    persistence at all, affecting only the period when they occur. Persistence of
    shocks is a stylized fact of macroeconomic time series and it provides a mechanism
    that could justify larger losses from climate change than previously estimated.
  2: This paper contributes to the understanding of how integrated assessment models
    (IAMs) handle the persistence of climate change impacts and proposes modifications
    to improve the representation of impact dynamics.
  3: Climate change impacts could be highly persistent through their effects on productivity,
    sectoral level persistence close to unity, economic impacts of climate change
    are highly sensitive to different levels of persistence, potential costs of climate
    change at global and regional scales for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios
    depend on the level of persistence.
  4: Structural breaks in GDP series affect persistence estimates; ignoring them can
    bias results upwards. Lack of persistence in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs)
    fails to represent observed dynamics of GDP shocks, relevant when assessing the
    potential costs of climate change. Shocks to GDP have non-zero persistence, contrary
    to some IAM assumptions. The PAGE2002 impact module has zero persistence.
  5: Impacts of sea level rise have a permanent effect on GDP level. Climate change
    damages in DICE include agriculture, sea level rise, other market sectors, human
    health, nonmarket amenity impacts, human settlements and ecosystems, and catastrophes.
    The impact module of DICE/RICE has zero persistence as any shock at time t has
    no impact at time t + s for s > 0, but the model dynamics impart persistence to
    shocks in GDP. Total factor productivity and Population are modeled in an exponential
    format.
  6: IAMs often underestimate the persistence of climate change impacts, which can
    lead to underestimation of long-term economic consequences. Lack of persistence
    in IAMs like DICE assumes large adaptation capacity and resilience.
  7: Impacts are represented as a multiple of the 2001 GDP and vary significantly
    based on regional and scenario-specific conditions.
  8: The uncertainty in the persistence of climate change impacts tends to have a
    larger effect over the estimated costs than the use of different climate change
    scenarios. Accumulated costs of climate change are more sensitive to the persistence
    parameter than to the climate change scenario for most regions (except Europe
    and North America). Regional differences are significant and become larger when
    the persistence of shocks is considered.
  9: The lack of persistence in climate shocks assumed by most IAMs can lead to extreme
    assumptions about resilience and adaptation.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of the persistence of generic shocks in observed GDP series, comparison
    with leading IAMs, investigation of growth implications for two RCP scenarios.
  2: The paper focuses on analyzing the dynamics of damage functions within IAMs by
    introducing modifications to make impact dynamics explicit, thus enhancing model
    transparency.
  3: Empirical approach based on econometrics literature, Augmented Dickey-Fuller
    test (ADF), examines persistence of shocks to GDP for 12 country groups from 1950-2008
    using Maddison database, sensitivity analysis varying persistence in simulated
    future GDP using PAGE2002 model
  4: Kim and Perron (2009) unit root test applied to investigate the persistence of
    GDP series. The Perron and Yabu (2009) procedure is used for structural change
    pretesting. AR(1) models with coefficients equal to the SAR are proposed as a
    simplification for representing the dynamics of GDP.
  5: Uses the DICE (Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy) model, which is a Solow growth
    model with a Cobb-Douglas production function. The model incorporates climate
    change damages into the production function. The results are applicable in the
    long run for population.
  6: Uses Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) like DICE and PAGE, with damage functions
    based on temperature increases and economic growth models. The analysis explores
    equilibrium and disequilibrium dynamics, examining the persistence of climate
    change impacts within different time steps (e.g., 10-year steps in DICE).  Examines
    how time-step length influences model results.
  7: Analysis uses integrated assessment models (IAMs) and equations assuming equilibrium
    and transient climate values to project economic impacts of climate change.
  8: The PAGE2002 model is used with modifications to incorporate the persistence
    of shocks. Simulations are performed with 5000 realizations and a time-step of
    one year.  The analysis considers the period up to the end of the century. Regional
    temperature increase is estimated using scaling factors obtained from the emulation
    of the UKMOHADCM3 General Circulation Model of MAGICC/ScenGen.
  9: Analysis involves theoretical assumptions about the persistence of climate shocks
    in integrated assessment models (IAMs).
  10: Macroeconomic shocks to output are investigated and used to compare with Integrated
    Assessment Models (IAMs). The persistence of shocks in macroeconomic and financial
    time series is considered. Estimates of regional differences are also investigated.
More Notes:
  1: The way of introducing climate shocks to GDP in most IAMs can be interpreted
    as assuming an autonomous, costless, large and effective reactive adaptation capacity.
  3: The study assesses the importance of the persistence of shocks to GDP.
  4: Discusses persistence in GDP data and persistence in integrated assessment models
    (PAGE, FUND, and DICE).
  5: The DICE model is more complex than PAGE and FUND models. There are two types
    of dynamics in a growth model, namely equilibrium dynamics and disequilibrium
    dynamics.
  6: The paper argues for the inclusion of persistence effects in IAMs to better reflect
    the long-term economic consequences of climate change impacts.
  8: The paper examines the sensitivity of the estimates of the costs of climate change
    to different assumptions regarding the memory of GDP. A simple impact function
    based on PAGE2002 is used, with a one-period memory equation with persistence
    parameter a.
  9: The presence of zero persistence in IAMs assumes infinitely large and costless
    adaptation capacities.
  10: Empirical estimates of the persistence of climate shocks are not obtainable.

Quantitative material:
  1: The paper analyzes the persistence of generic shocks in observed GDP series for
    different world regions and compares it to that of leading IAMs. The implications
    for growth are investigated for two RCP scenarios.
  4: SAR estimates range from 0.46 to 0.90 with structural breaks accounted for. Without
    a trend break, a unit shock would produce a CIR of 25.57; with trend break being
    taken into account, the accumulated response would be only 1.85. CIR values range
    from 1.85 to 23.81, with a mean of 5.87.
