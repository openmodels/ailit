Drivers of Risk:
  3: Changes in mean temperature and rainfall leading to stronger droughts; climate
    change induced irregular agricultural production patterns; climate extremes.
  4: CO2 level, average annual temperature, and rainfall
  5: Temperature, precipitation, CO2 emissions, land area under cereal crops, fertilizer
    consumption, energy consumption, climate change, rainfall
  6: No relevant information
  8: Average annual temperature, average annual rainfall, CO2 emission levels, primary
    energy consumption per capita, and total fertilizers by nutrients used in the
    agricultural sector.
  11: CO2 emission level and temperature increase as the main climate change indicators.
  12: "CO2 emissions (lnCO2, \u2206lnCO2), Temperature (lnTEMP, \u2206lnTEMP), Rainfall\
    \ (lnRF, \u2206lnRF), Energy Consumption (lnEC, \u2206lnEC), Fertilizer Expenditure\
    \ (lnFE, \u2206lnFE)"
  13: CO2 emissions and annual temperature increases.
  17: Increasing Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; climate change on maize yields
Highlights:
  3: Climate change makes agricultural productivity more vulnerable; Developing countries
    are more vulnerable to climate change than developed countries, making agricultural
    sustainable development crucial in South and Southeast Asia.
  4: Analyzes the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity for selected
    Asian countries using advanced panel data techniques, considering the short and
    long-run effects of CO2 level, average annual temperature, and rainfall.
  5: Climate change can negatively affect cereal production, mostly due to the shortage
    of rainfall, whereas current temperature level has a positive impact on cereal
    production in Tunisia; CO2 emissions, land area under cereal crops, fertilizer
    consumption and energy consumption have a positive impact on the agricultural
    output both in the short-run and long-run in China, temperature and rainfall have
    a negative effect on agricultural output in the long-run but positive in the short-run
    in China
  6: No relevant information
  9: The results of the unit root tests show mixed results regarding the existence
    of unit-roots in their levels for the variables employed in the model. All variables
    are stationary in their first differences, suggesting they are integrated of order
    one, or I(1).
  11: Temperature and CO2 emissions negatively impact productivity, while rainfall,
    energy, and fertilizer consumption positively impact productivity.
  12: In the long run, CO2 emissions and temperature have a significant negative impact
    on agricultural productivity, while rainfall, energy consumption, and fertilizer
    expenditure have a significant positive impact. In the short run, the impact of
    CO2 emissions on agricultural productivity is positive, and the impact of energy
    consumption on agricultural productivity is negative.
  13: CO2 emissions are linked to agricultural productivity in the short term (positive
    effect), but have a negative impact in the long term; carbon emissions and annual
    temperature have an adverse effect on agricultural productivity in the long run.

Methodology:
  3: Discussion of trends and factors influencing agricultural productivity, particularly
    in Asia, with some comparison to Africa. No specific modeling or projections are
    mentioned.
  4: 'Panel data techniques: mean group (MG), pooled mean group (PMG), and dynamic
    fixed effect (DFE) estimators. Focuses on short and long-run effects.'
  5: Ricardian Approach (analyzing associations between land value and agro-climatic
    variables), Time Series/Panel Data Approach (examining the association between
    weather and net income), panel data cointegration method, ARDL model, Pooled Mean
    Group (PMG) estimation method
  6: The study uses a panel-data approach with a panel ARDL model to examine the dynamic
    relationship between agricultural productivity and climate change indicators in
    11 Asian countries from 1980-2016.
  8: Panel ARDL estimators used to estimate short-run and long-run relationships.
    Unit root tests were conducted to verify the stationarity of the variables. All
    variables transformed into natural logarithmic forms to alleviate multicollinearity.
  9: The paper uses panel unit root tests (Im, Pesaran and Shin (IPS) and Levin Lin
    and Chu (LLC)) to examine the stationarity of the data. It also employs the panel
    residual cointegration technique suggested by Pedroni to investigate the existence
    of a long-run relationship between the variables.
  11: Analysis performed using Mean Group (MG), Pooled Mean Group (PMG), and Dynamic
    Fixed Effects (DFE) estimators, with choice of PMG based on Hausman test results.
  12: Panel data analysis using Pooled Mean Group (PMG), Mean Group (MG), and Dynamic
    Fixed Effects (DFE) estimators. Hausman test is used to select the best estimator.

    1980-2016, investigating short-run and long-run effects of climate change on agricultural
    productivity.
