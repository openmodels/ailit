  18: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: Water scarcity, extreme temperature events, soil degradation, and climate change
    in dryland areas of MENA and SSA
  9: Demand and trade activity in NUS, reliance on wheat imports.
  10: The need to import significant quantities of wheat and NUS contributes to the
    negative trade balance.
  18: Limited genetic diversity and susceptibility of millet to drought and pests;
    Poor market access and limited research on the nutritional benefits of millet;
    High input costs for seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides for NUS, Pest and Disease
    Pressure, particularly those affected by broomrape (Orobanche spp.)
Highlights:
  1: NUS can improve dryland food and nutrition security by offering higher water
    productivity and heat tolerance compared to major cereals; Integrating NUS into
    dryland farming systems enhances food security, sustainability, and resilience
    to climate change.
  7: In MENA, the total area for NUS has increased since 1961 but has seen a 7.0%
    decline in the last 5 years. Sudan's NUS area increased from 8.18 Mha in 2012
    to 18.84 Mha in 2018 and then declined.
  9: NUS imports have consistently outpaced exports in the MENA region, resulting
    in a growing trade deficit in quantity.
  10: Wheat imports exceeded exports significantly, contributing to a negative trade
    balance. NUS also had a negative trade balance, despite increased exports.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of long-term data from FAOSTAT, USDA Food Data Central, and peer-reviewed
    literature on 21 NUS across 22 countries in MENA, comparing them with major staples
    (rice, wheat, and maize). Field experiment in Merchouch, Morocco.
  7: Descriptive statistics, trend analyses, and mean percentages; regression and
    time-series analysis; multicriteria decision analysis to evaluate trade-offs between
    indicators; indicators were normalized and weighted for comparative analysis.
More Notes:
  1: Focus is on neglected and underutilized species (NUS) in dryland agriculture
    in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) regions.
No relevant information:
  3: This page focuses on agricultural research related to neglected and underutilized
    species (NUS) in the MENA region and does not provide information on macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal risks of climate change, nor the costs and benefits of adaptation
    at a national level. The research is primarily focused on crop yields, water use
    efficiency, and production costs related to specific crops.
  17: No relevant information
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic viability (specifically higher economic value per unit than wheat) and
    food security
  9: Trade balance for neglected and underutilized species (NUS) and wheat.
  10: Negative trade balance in both quantity and value for wheat and NUS in the MENA
    region.
Quantitative material:
  1: "NUS areas in MENA decreased by 7.0% since 2018 to 21.17 Mha; NUS demonstrated\
    \ up to 30% higher water productivity than major cereals; Sorghum and cowpea achieved\
    \ 2.5 kg/m3 water productivity compared to maize (0.83 kg/m3) and wheat (0.91\
    \ kg/m3); Sorghum withstands temperatures of up to 42\xB0C, and cowpea up to 38\xB0\
    C."
  9: Import of NUS in the MENA region increased from 0.19 Mt. in 1961 to 8.13 Mt.
    in 2022. Exports grew from 0.16 Mt. in 1961 to 3.87 Mt. in 2022. Wheat imports
    surged from 3.52 Mt. in 1961 to 34.78 Mt. in 2022. The value of NUS imports climbed
    from USD 1 billion in 1961 to USD 8.98 billion in 2022. The export value grew
    from USD 0.01 billion in 1961 to USD 3.35 billion in 2022.
  10: Between 2018 and 2022, NUS import quantity increased from 7.71 to 8.13 Mt, and
    exports grew from 1.99 to 3.87 Mt, but the trade balance remained negative.
