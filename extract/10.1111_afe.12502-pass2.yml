Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, specifically future climate scenarios SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5,
    annual average temperature, mean annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality,
    average variation of daytime temperature, and mean seasonality of temperature.
  3: The climatic data used for this study were gathered from the WorldClim environmental
    database (http://www.worldclim.org/).
  4: No relevant information
  5: Temperature seasonality, annual average temperature, daytime temperature variation,
    and annual precipitation influence the distribution of Aceria guerreronis.
  6: Temperature seasonality (bio_4), annual average temperature (bio_1), and annual
    precipitation (bio_12) are identified as important environmental variables affecting
    Aceria guerreronis occurrence.
  7: Climate change, specifically the SSP2.6 and SSP8.5 scenarios.
  8: The study examines how climate conditions, specifically under the shared socio-economic
    pathway (SSP2.6), affect the suitability of habitats for *Aceria guerreronis*.
  9: Climate conditions in 2040 and 2060 under the shared socio-economic pathway (SSP8.5).

  7: Habitat suitability for the coconut mite Aceria guerreronis.
  8: The study evaluates the projected future distribution of *Aceria guerreronis*,
    a pest, under different climate scenarios.
  9: Economically important pest of coconut wherever it occurs.
  15: The study evaluates the potential geographical distribution of the invasive
    coconut mite, Aceria guerreronis.
Highlights:
  1: The MaxEnt model predicts habitat suitability for A. guerreronis outside its
    present distribution, with suitable habitats in Oceania, Asia, Africa, and the
    Americas. The habitat suitability for the pest will decrease from 2040 to 2060.
  3: No relevant information
  4: MaxEnt model provides satisfactory results (AUC = 0.975) for predicting the distribution
    of *Aceria guerreronis*.
  5: Temperature seasonality and annual average temperature are the most important
    environmental variables influencing the predicted distribution of Aceria guerreronis.
  6: Temperature seasonality, annual average temperature, and annual precipitation
    are identified as key environmental variables influencing the occurrence of Aceria
    guerreronis.
  7: Future predictions show an expansion of habitat suitability from the current
    time to the future under SSP2.6, with major coconut-producing countries likely
    to remain suitable. Under SSP8.5, suitable areas are predicted to decrease from
    2040 to 2060.
  8: The model predicts a slight expansion of habitat suitability for the pest when
    Ghana occurrences were removed from the datasets. The model predicts suitable
    areas where the pest was identified and sampled. Prediction with only Ghana data
    was consistent with known occurrence records of the pest in Ghana.
  9: Predicted future distribution of Aceria guerreronis in the shared socio-economic
    pathway (SSP8.5) of climate conditions in 2040 and 2060.
Methodology:
  1: A machine learning algorithm based on maximum entropy (MaxEnt) was used to predict
    the potential global distribution of A. guerreronis. The potential future distribution
    was predicted for the 2040 and 2060 periods.
  3: used MaxEnt to model and map regions suitable for coconut mites to provide information
    for the implementation of quarantine measures
  4: MaxEnt model used with 19 bioclimatic datasets to predict *Aceria guerreronis*
    distribution; 80% of occurrence sites used for training data, 20% for testing;
    four suitability classes (unsuitable, low, medium, high) based on MTSPS values
    were used to predict future areas.
  5: MaxEnt was used to generate response curves and model the potential distribution
    of Aceria guerreronis based on 19 environmental variables. The results were averaged
    over 10 repeated runs.
  6: A jackknife test was used to evaluate the relative importance of environmental
    variables based on regularized training gain and AUC. Response curves were generated
    for the best predictors of Aceria guerreronis occurrence based on 10 replicates.
  7: Species distribution modeling used to predict current and future habitat suitability
    for A. guerreronis under different climate scenarios (SSP2.6 and SSP8.5).
  8: The study uses species distribution modeling, employing different occurrence
    datasets (all occurrences, without Ghana occurrences, only Ghana occurrences)
    to predict suitable areas for *A. guerreronis*. The analysis examines current
    and future time periods.
  9: MaxEnt model to predict the current and future distributions of A. guerreronis.
  15: The study uses a model-based prediction approach (MaxEnt) to determine the geographical
    distribution of the coconut mite.
More Notes:
  3: The study uses species distribution modeling (SDM) to predict the suitable habitat
    of coconut mites using climatic variables.
  4: The study uses a thinning process to reduce redundancy in occurrence data before
    modeling.
  5: The thermal conditions (temperature variables) contributed 84.61% and rainfall
    conditions 15.38% to the distribution model.
  6: The analysis focuses on modeling the distribution of Aceria guerreronis based
    on environmental factors.
  7: The paper focuses on the shift in habitat suitability for a specific agricultural
    pest, not a broad climate impact. Maps showing current and projected habitat suitability
    are included.
  8: The analysis explores the impact of different data inputs (inclusion/exclusion
    of Ghana data) on model predictions. The study focuses on *Aceria guerreronis*,
    a pest and not a direct climate impact, but climate impacts influence the spatial
    distribution of *Aceria guerreronis*. There is also a second image about projected
    cashew distributions under climate change.
  9: The model's predictions are reliable.
