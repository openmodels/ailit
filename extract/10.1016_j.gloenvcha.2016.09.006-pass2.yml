Drivers of Risk:
  3: Environmental change, temperature and precipitation variability
  12: Temperature and precipitation variability.
  17: Variations in seasonal temperatures (spring, summer, winter) and summer precipitation
    during early childhood.
  25: Climate variability; unfavorable climatic conditions.
  34: Seasonal variations and long-term trends in rainfall and temperature.
  40: Climate variables such as summer and winter temperature and precipitation affect
    child labor patterns, which indirectly suggests potential impacts on household
    economic decisions.
Highlights:
  3: "Ethiopia is particularly vulnerable to the effects of changes in temperature\
    \ and precipitation, as 84% of the population lives in rural areas, 42% of the\
    \ country\u2019s GDP is derived from agriculture, and only 3% of agricultural\
    \ land is irrigated."
  17: Early life climatic conditions, specifically seasonal temperatures and summer
    precipitation, are significant determinants of schooling attainment.
  25: Policies to buffer against the economic and health impacts of climate change
    will better enable households to keep their children in school, and will protect
    them from the negative socioeconomic impacts of a changing climate.
  34: Clear seasonal patterns and long-term trends observed in climate data.
  40: Summer temperature increases the likelihood of any farm labor participation;
    winter precipitation decreases farm labor hours and any domestic labor.
Methodology:
  3: The goal of this paper is to examine the intersection between environmental change
    and education by studying how temperature and precipitation variability impact
    schooling outcomes in rural Ethiopia.
  12: Climate data (temperature and precipitation) from CRU Time Series (Harris et
    al. 2014) was linked to survey data at the village level using GPS points to generate
    measures of temperature and precipitation variability at the village-year scale.
    Climate data from 1970 to 2009 is used. Data from 15 study villages is used.
  17: Logistic regression of the likelihood of completing at least one grade of school,
    using climate z-scores relative to 1970-2009 averages as predictors. Child labor
    and per capita food consumption included as variables.
  34: Data analysis of rainfall and temperature patterns over time.
  40: Analysis is performed using logit and OLS models on data from 2004 and 2009
    to assess participation in and hours of child labor as a function of climate activity.
More Notes:
  3: The paper focuses on the link between environmental change, schooling, and agricultural
    households' living standards in rural Ethiopia.
  17: The study uses data from 2004 and 2009 surveys. Child labor data indicates high
    participation rates (57% in farm labor, 81% in domestic labor) with significant
    hours per week. Data collected from April and June.
  25: The page suggests policies like crop insurance, drought/heat tolerant crop varieties,
    and school fee reduction as ways to safeguard rural households. It also calls
    for further research to understand pathways between climate variability and educational
    outcomes in different contexts, to inform effective policies for universal education.
  34: Graphs provide visual representation of climatic fluctuations relevant to assessing
    climate risks.
  40: This data highlights the relationship between climate conditions and child labor,
    indicating indirect economic impacts rather than direct macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes.
No relevant information:
  4: No relevant information
  10: No relevant information
  16: No macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, costs, or benefits of adaptation
    are examined in this page. The focus is on micro-level impacts of climate variability
    on education, food consumption, crop yields and child labor.
  42: This page does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks, costs,
    or benefits at a national level. It focuses on individual and household-level
    impacts related to schooling, food security, and crop yields.
  43: No macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, risks, or adaptation costs/benefits
    are mentioned on this page. The focus is on child labor outcomes at an individual
    level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Implies that lowered educational attainment could represent an important and
    unexplored pathway by which future climate change undermines gains in human development.
  12: Poverty levels, food insecurity.
  17: Educational attainment (likelihood of completing at least one grade of school)
    as a measure of human capital development.
  25: Economic and health impacts of climate change; socioeconomic impacts; educational
    outcomes (school attendance).
  34: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes discussed.
  40: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  12: In 2009, 52% of households reported not being able to satisfy their food needs
    for at least three months during the year.
  17: Average spring temperatures 0.5 SD above the village's long-term mean are associated
    with a 21% lower odds of completing at least one grade of school (p=0.049). Summer
    temperatures 0.5 SD above the village long-term average are associated with a
    28% lower odds of completing any schooling (p=0.001). Summer precipitation 0.5
    SD above the mean is associated with a 22% higher odds (p=0.050). Average early
    childhood winter temperatures 0.5 SD above the village long-term mean are associated
    with an 43% higher odds of any schooling (p=0.016).
  34: Rainfall and temperature data from 1970 to 2009 shown in graphs.
  40: Logit and OLS models provide coefficients and odds ratios for participation
    in farm and domestic child labor based on climate variables and individual/household
    controls.
