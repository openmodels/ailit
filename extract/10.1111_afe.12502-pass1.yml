Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5) impact the future distribution
    of A. guerreronis.
  2: Climate change plays an important role in the distribution of species. Greenhouse
    gas emissions due to anthropogenic activities are associated with global warming.
    Increasing CO2 levels can have a significant impact on plants and pathogens.
  4: No relevant information
  5: Seasonality of temperature, annual average temperature, average variation of
    daytime temperature, and annual precipitation are key environmental variables
    influencing coconut mite (A. guerreronis) distribution.
  6: Temperature seasonality (bio_4), annual average temperature (bio_1), and annual
    precipitation (bio_12) are important environmental variables influencing the occurrence
    of Aceria guerreronis.
  7: Climate change (SSP2.6 and SSP8.5 scenarios) impacts habitat suitability for
    Aceria guerreronis.
  8: The analysis is focused on the impacts of climate change, specifically within
    the SSP1-2.6 scenario, on the habitat suitability for Aceria guerreronis.
  9: Climate conditions in 2040 and 2060 under SSP8.5, environmental variables that
    had the strongest influence on coconut mite habitat suitability
  10: Thermal parameters like seasonality of temperature and annual average temperature,
    more than annual precipitation, are the main factors influencing the potential
    spread of the coconut mite Aceria guerreronis.
Evaluation overview:
  1: The paper evaluates the potential geographical distribution of the invasive coconut
    mite, Aceria guerreronis, which causes significant economic losses.
  2: Significant economic copra losses are associated with mite infestations.
  4: No relevant information
  5: No relevant information
  6: No relevant information
  7: No relevant information
  8: The analysis predicts the future distribution of Aceria guerreronis under the
    SSP1-2.6 climate scenario for 2040 and 2060.
  9: Economically important pest of coconut wherever it occurs; global potential distribution
    maps of its expansion are essential for economic and quarantine purposes worldwide,
    especially for areas where the pest has not been reported.
  10: No specific information about the outcome evaluation such as mortality or productivity
    loss.
Highlights:
  1: The model predicts habitat suitability for A. guerreronis outside its present
    distribution and shows a decrease in habitat suitability from 2040 to 2060.
  3: The study aims to inform quarantine measures and highlight policy formulation
    needs for coconut mite distribution.
  4: The MaxEnt model provided satisfactory results in predicting the distribution
    of Aceria guerreronis.
  5: The model predicts highly suitable areas for A. guerreronis are primarily centered
    on the west and east coasts of Africa, the south and east coasts of Asia, the
    north coast of Oceania, the east coast of South America, and the south coast of
    North America.
  6: Temperature seasonality, annual average temperature, and annual precipitation
    are identified as key predictors of Aceria guerreronis occurrence. Light green
    bars generally show higher values in both jackknife tests, suggesting the variables
    on their own provide more information to the model than variables in combination.
  7: The model predicts an expansion of habitat suitability from the current time
    to the future under SSP2.6, with major coconut-producing countries continuing
    to be suitable. Under SSP8.5, the model predicts a decrease in suitable areas
    from 2040 to 2060.
  8: There is a predicted expansion of suitable habitats for Aceria guerreronis by
    2060, as shown by an increase in suitable areas in the given maps.
  9: Predicted future distribution of Aceria guerreronis in the shared socio-economic
    pathway (SSP8.5) of climate conditions in 2040 and 2060; some areas have changed
    in suitability between 2040 and 2060, with an increase in regions shifting towards
    higher suitability levels; a general trend towards increased suitability in specific
    areas as the timeline progresses from 2040 to 2060.
  10: The main distribution zones of the coconut mite Aceria guerreronis are influenced
    more by temperature parameters than by rainfall.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis is performed using a machine learning algorithm based on maximum
    entropy (MaxEnt) and is applicable to the periods 2040 and 2060.
  2: Species distribution models (SDMs) employ computer algorithms to predict the
    habitat suitability of a species across geographical space and time based on environmental
    data. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) employs presence-only data to predict the distribution
    of species based on the theory of maximum entropy.
  3: Spatial filtering applied using R software package spThin to reduce spatial autocorrelation.
  4: The MaxEnt model was used based on 19 bioclimatic datasets to predict areas of
    suitability for Aceria guerreronis. 80% of occurrence sites were used as training
    data, and 20% were used to test the resulting models. Future areas are classified
    as unsuitable (0-MTSPS), low (MTSPS-0.5), medium (0.5-0.7), and high (0.7-1.0)
    suitability.
  5: MaxEnt model was used to predict the potential distribution of the coconut mite
    based on 19 environmental variables. The model's performance was evaluated using
    a jackknife test and response curves.
  6: Uses jackknife tests of regularized training gain and AUC to assess the relative
    importance of environmental variables. Response curves are generated using an
    unspecified model for Aceria guerreronis occurrence, with averages computed over
    10 replicates.
  7: Species distribution modeling predicts habitat suitability for Aceria guerreronis
    under current and future climate scenarios (SSP2.6 and SSP8.5) from 2040 to 2060.
  8: The study uses models to predict habitat suitability for Aceria guerreronis,
    comparing scenarios using all occurrences vs. only Ghana occurrences.
  9: MaxEnt model to predict the current and future distributions of A. guerreronis;
    considers presence records only
  10: The analysis evaluates the potential distribution and spread of Aceria guerreronis
    based on thermal parameters and precipitation.
More Notes:
  4: This study focuses on modeling the distribution of Aceria guerreronis, a pest
    that can impact agricultural production, although this is not explicitly stated
    on this page.
  5: The thermal conditions contributed 84.61% and rainfall conditions 15.38% to the
    model.
  6: The plots show the relationship between Aceria guerreronis and different climate-related
    variables, showing preferences or thresholds in temperature seasonality, average
    temperature, and precipitation levels, although the directionality is not consistent
    (e.g. temperature seasonality decreases probability of occurence while annual
    temperature increases it).
  7: The areas that will remain medium to high suitability are mainly found on the
    west and east coasts of Africa, east coast of South America, south and east coasts
    of Asia, and north coast of Oceania.
  9: The invasive coconut mite is most likely a South American native travelled with
    the seeds to Africa and Asia.
