Drivers of Risk:
  1: HMHs (Hydro-meteorological Hazards).
  2: Increasing hydro-meteorological hazards (HMHs) such as heatwaves and floods,
    exacerbated by climate change.
  4: Floods, droughts, landslides, coastal erosion, storm surge, and nutrients and
    sediment loading, all exacerbated by climate change.
Highlights:
  1: HMHs negatively affect human life and economy in Europe and globally; there is
    an emerging need to improve coherence between DRR and NBS in Europe; integrating
    and cataloguing of NBS into policy databases is still at an early stage; links
    between science and stakeholders are hampered by lack of effective communication;
    practical implementation of NBS needs a holistic approach, complementary tools
    and instruments.
  2: Holistic management of HMHs by effective use of NBS can be achieved with standard
    compliant data for replicating and monitoring NBS in OALs, knowledge about policy
    silos and interaction between research communities and end-users.
Methodology:
  2: Discussion of the operationalization and implementation processes of Nature-Based
    Solutions (NBS) by means of a novel concept of Open-Air Laboratories (OAL) for
    its wider acceptance.
  4: The paper reviews European and international policies for HMHs and their implications
    for NBS. It discusses the practicality of NBS, including market opportunities,
    cost-effectiveness, and designing strategies with stakeholders for HMRs reduction.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on nature-based solutions (NBS) for natural hazards and disaster
    risk reduction (DRR).

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: HMHs (Hydro-meteorological Hazards) negatively affect human life and economy
    in Europe and globally.
  2: Economic damage due to natural hazards, particularly hydro-meteorological hazards
    (HMHs).
  4: Cost-benefit analysis of NBS is mentioned in connection with the GREEN SURGE
    project and Unalab.
Quantitative material:
  2: HMHs were responsible for more than 80% (502.56 billion USD) of the total economic
    damage due to natural hazards (618.5 billion USD) and caused around 90,325 fatalities
    in Europe during the period from 1980 to 2017.
