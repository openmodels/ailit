Highlights:
  23: Policymakers are taking note of crises around global warming and COVID-19, influencing
    food system strategies.
  25: Food systems are open to novel risks, including droughts, biofuels expansion,
    financial speculation, and trade barriers. The COVID-19 pandemic and armed conflicts
    have shaken food value chains, driving up food prices. Addressing inequalities
    could significantly increase productivity.
  28: No relevant information
  35: The necessity for food systems transformations to consider factors like demographic
    and climate change, and the role of science-policy cooperation is emphasized.
  55: The consumption of unsafe foods costs low- and middle-income countries at least
    US$ 110 billion in lost productivity and medical expenses annually.
  79: Hunger and undernutrition can cost countries between 2% and 17% of their GDP.
  90: A significant portion of the global population, particularly in low-income countries
    and regions like sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, cannot afford a healthy
    diet. The cost of a healthy diet often exceeds average national food expenditures,
    especially in the Global South.
  91: Zoonotic disease spillovers can have dramatic economic consequences and cause
    global pandemics; the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global value chains impacting
    affordability and food availability.
  92: Increased local value chain production and market shares during disruptions.
  122: Transformation of agrifood systems will have macroeconomic implications (employment,
    income, cost of living, fiscal consequences) and economy-wide trade-offs.
  134: The paper aims to assess 'systemic' risk arising from complex interactions
    within the agrifood system.
  135: Key structural interventions can reduce chronic hunger by 314 million people
    and allow 568 million more to afford healthy diets by 2030.
  140: Interventions show trade-offs, but are relatively small; innovation and full
    package have the largest effects. Food loss and waste reduction results in improvement
    across all trade-offs. Net agricultural emissions and AFOLU effects are negative.
  141: Ending chronic hunger by 2030 is possible with structural interventions in
    agrifood systems. Interventions can create synergies to address causes of hunger
    and minimize the total cost of interventions. Food loss and waste reduction has
    positive effects across all trade-offs.
  146: The figures (A.3 and A.4) illustrate how past weather data can be used to assess
    risk exposure of various populations (example of provinces in the DRC) using their
    analytical framework.
  147: Vulnerable farmers in Kasai, Kasai-Central and Kwilu experience fluctuations
    in value of production as a share of income
  159: Morbidity affects labor availability and productivity, and influences technology
    choices; Different health services have varying impacts on disease prevalence
    and livelihoods, affecting efficiency.
  220: Diversification of production, particularly for crops and cropping systems,
    has received increasing attention in recent years as a means of building resilience
    to climate change and increasing extreme weather events.
  221: Economic costs of diversifying farming systems often outweigh the ecological
    benefits, suggesting the need for adequate policies to support the development
    of diverse and sustainable production and farming systems and households.
  224: Government interventions in markets during crisis periods can exacerbate price
    rises. Improved market information can help avoid over-reactions by governments
    and markets.
  225: Diversification is fundamental for food system resilience and can occur at
    many different levels. Interactions between diversification of production, diets
    and markets are not straightforward and need more attention.
  360: Sustainably-produced food procurement can support low-income groups and create
    new socio-economic relationships, contributing to sustainable food systems.
  390: Very small farms (<2 ha) are particularly important in China, producing over
    60% of bovine milk and meat. Smallholder monogastric systems are an important
    source of pork, poultry and eggs in South and Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.
  397: Reducing consumption of ASFs, especially ruminant meat, has the largest technical
    potential for greenhouse gas mitigation through land sparing.
  429: Regulatory frameworks that consider evidence-based scientific approaches balancing
    safety, time, and costs, and that are both risk-proportional and fair, generally
    leading to valuable technologies being approved for potential producer use.
  433: LMICs with lagging research systems account for only 3% of total R&D investment
    in LMICs and show slower agricultural productivity growth; substantial progress
    could be made with increased R&D efforts.
  434: Investment gap is much higher in countries with lagging and average agricultural
    research systems than in countries with advanced systems; The human capital gap
    is even more significant than the investment gap, affecting the quality, scope,
    and potential of research systems in LMICs.
  435: Facilitating LMIC engagement with global players in food system innovations
    to strengthen IP access and management capacity is important.
  442: "Pests remain a major barrier to crop production, with annual losses estimated\
    \ at between 20\u201340%; Climate change is predicted to increase the likelihood,\
    \ frequency, and impact of pests, resulting in increased crop losses and damage\
    \ to the economy of low-income countries."
  443: Prevention is far more effective than cure in integrated pest management (IPM).
    Timely pest risk prediction information through risk-mapping or early warning
    systems is of paramount importance.
  448: Early warning systems based on data and technology can mitigate the impact
    of pests like desert locusts on food production.
  464: Investing in nutritious food can reduce health care expenses and provide an
    asset class for institutional investors while generating inclusive economic growth.
  472: Agriculture needs a multipronged approach involving regenerative production
    systems and strict conservation of intact habitats to address risks to food security
    and climate regulation
  486: "Agricultural landscapes need at least 10\u201320% of diversified habitats\
    \ to retain ecological integrity."
  501: Water scarcity and pollution are growing, affecting poorer populations, especially
    food producers.
  503: Changes in food systems are needed to meet SDG 6 targets, including reducing
    food loss and waste, lowering pollution, and considering environmental sustainability

    with tropical and sub-tropical regions expected to face detrimental changes impacting
    food and nutrition security.
  514: Projected increase in hunger risk; significant role of climate change-food
    systems interactions in sustainable development goals.
  516: Climate change is projected to increase global cereal prices, impacting food
    access, with net food-selling agricultural producers potentially benefitting while
    the urban poor and net food-buying agricultural producers will primarily be hurt.
  520: Food systems should be a high priority for adaptation and mitigation investments
    due to their impact by climate change and as a major source of GHG emissions.
  525: Climate change is projected to affect food systems significantly, but adaptation
    strategies exist to address these challenges.
  540: No relevant information
  545: Loss of crop diversity poses a considerable risk to global food security because
    the genetic diversity of cultivated plants is the raw material for crop improvement.
  551: Issuance of a Food Security Bond, supported by government guarantees and grants,
    can engage private market investors and government donors to support global crop
    diversity.
  584: The paper emphasizes the disparities between the financial valuation of company
    activities and their actual societal value, particularly in terms of environmental
    and social externalities.
  587: The paper highlights the significant external costs associated with the global
    food system, which are often not reflected in standard economic analyses.
  589: The 'true cost' of food (29 trillion USD per year) is disproportionately high
    compared to the current cost at market prices (9 trillion USD).
  592: Global dietary shifts have potentially substantial health benefits, with values
    around 5 trillion international dollars for different dietary patterns (REF, PSC,
    VEG, VGN).
  603: The cost of a basic plate can take a large fraction of the international poverty
    line at $1.90/day and often exceeds the daily income of resource-poor households.
  605: Pre-cooked pulses are more expensive than dried pulses, while canned fish is
    less expensive than fresh fish. High cost of cooking healthy processed foods is
    an obstacle to dietary transformation. 'More convenient' food versions are generally
    more expensive.
  624: Reducing hunger requires pro-poor investments of US$265 billion annually, including
    in agriculture, natural resources, agro-processing, infrastructure, and R&D.
  625: The study estimates the investment costs required to accelerate hunger reduction
    and potentially eliminate hunger by 2030.
  632: Food security can be enhanced through multiple investment options that intensify
    agricultural production and improve agricultural productivity.
  635: Climate change exacerbates hunger, leading to a higher number of undernourished
    people compared to scenarios without climate change. Socio-economic development
    pathways significantly influence future hunger levels, with high population growth,
    economic stagnation, and high-income inequality leading to the worst outcomes.
  637: To meet the G7 commitment of lifting 500 million people out of hunger by 2030,
    an average annual investment ranging between about US$ 11 to 14 billion will be
    required.
  638: Increasing agricultural efficiency has the potential to increase yield by 36%
    and reduce hunger by US$1.97 billion.
  640: Investments in agricultural technology and infrastructure (ICT, roads, electricity)
    are simulated to reduce poverty and hunger.
  641: Analysis focuses on the cost of reaching a world without hunger and the cost-effectiveness
    of different interventions, including trade liberalization and social protection
    programs.
  642: No relevant information
  644: The table presents the least-cost rank of different interventions to address
    hunger, along with the associated costs and number of people lifted out of hunger.
  646: Investments in various sectors (agriculture, trade, infrastructure) can significantly
    reduce hunger, but cost assessments and rankings of interventions are subject
    to uncertainties.
  649: The study acknowledges that conflict, pandemics, and extreme weather events
    are important drivers of acute food insecurity and impact the cost and potential
    of hunger prevention interventions. Climate change (rising temperatures, droughts,
    floods) impacts hunger levels and the effectiveness of interventions (irrigation
    improvements, hydraulic infrastructure).
  652: Achieving target 2.1 of SDG 2 need not be prohibitively expensive, provided
    that a mix of least-cost measures with large hunger reduction potential are prioritized;
    Investments with long-term effects should be frontloaded in the decade to have
    a large effect soon before 2030; To end hunger by 2030, options that require high
    up-front investments but also have a high long-term impact need to be in the investment
    mix; Overall, the measures included in this MACC analysis have the potential to
    lift about a billion people out of hunger over ten years until 2030.
  661: Developing countries spend a larger percentage of their budgets on AFF than
    developed ones. Developed countries spend more as a proportion of their agricultural
    sectors than developing countries (excluding China). The levels of public spending
    alone do not determine the performance of the agricultural sector, but the types
    of expenditure matter, particularly their orientation toward the provision of
    public goods.
  662: Developing countries (including China) spend 9.6% of their government outlays
    on AFF, while developed countries spend only 0.7%.
  667: Integrated programs using water management, infrastructure, and other interventions
    such as AgR&D, small crop protection and weeds to address hunger.
  669: Increased public expenditures in agriculture/rural development and social assistance
    are needed to combat hunger alongside climate measures; Reallocation of agricultural
    and fossil fuel subsidies and improved tax administration could free up resources.
  683: Trade restrictions exacerbate food price volatility and market instability.
  686: Trade openness can promote growth but affect income distribution. Eliminating
    agricultural tariffs can increase household incomes on average, but also exacerbate
    inequality in most countries. Trade-offs exist between promoting economic efficiency
    and generating positive social outcomes in food systems.
  690: Unilateral carbon taxes may inadvertently confer a competitive advantage on
    countries without similar measures, leading to emissions leakage.
  709: Strong economic recovery in Africa since the early 2000s has led to increased
    real per capita GDP and reductions in poverty. Population growth in SSA is expected
    to account for over half of the world's population growth between 2019 and 2050,
    leading to a widening food import gap.
  715: Livestock production offers opportunities for income and employment but also
    significant environmental challenges related to greenhouse gas emissions and water
    usage.
  780: China is vulnerable to climate-related risks, with agro-meteorological disasters
    causing significant GDP loss.
  794: Aquaculture development is necessary to preserve aquatic biological resources.
    Reducing food waste and loss plays an important role in the development of sustainable
    food systems around the world.
  796: Transition to agricultural production in closed systems independent of external
    agro-climatic factors is relevant and promising; Deep processing of grain can
    expand domestic use and international market opportunities.
  804: India transformed from a food deficit nation to a food surplus one through
    new technology (high yielding crop varieties), irrigation, fertilizers, and positive
    price policy.
  806: India transitioned from a food scarce to a food surplus nation, becoming globally
    competitive in agriculture, particularly in cotton production.
  809: The focus is on the importance of sustainable agriculture practices and income
    generation for farmers, which can lead to adaptation benefits such as reduced
    resource use and improved farmer prosperity.
  813: Investment in solar-powered cold storage and food processing can reduce agricultural
    losses and improve price realization for farmers, developing forward and backward
    linkages can ease price fluctuations.
  823: Multiple scientific opportunities have been identified to adapt the food system,
    such as developing climate-resilient agriculture, and improving agronomic practices
    to mitigate GHG emissions.
  838: Bioeconomy can play a fundamental role in decarbonization (SDG 13) and sustainable
    intensification of agricultural production (SDG 2, 3, 15). Closure of production
    cycles improves sustainable production indicators (SDG 12, 11).
  840: A growing bioeconomy can strengthen resilience to vulnerabilities and stresses
    in food systems through diversification of agricultural commodity production,
    increased use of bio-based inputs in agriculture, and diversification of rural
    incomes into rural production of bioenergy, bio-based industry, and environmental
    services.
  844: Improved productivity of bioeconomy sectors through learning-by-doing and technological
    updating can reduce costs and environmental impacts of biofuels while enhancing
    added value; Use of biomass residues can transform waste into energy and contribute
    a considerable percentage to total bioenergy generation.
  858: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the food supply chain, impacting workforce,
    trade, and consumer prices, and threatening jobs in the food value chain. Pathogens
    in food systems may trigger interventions that impact the food chain.
  880: Food systems need to deliver universal access to healthy diets; Consumer demand
    needs to be harnessed as a significant driver of change; Food systems must become
    fully environmentally sustainable; The transition needs to be a 'just' rural and
    urban process, so that it reduces inequality and inequities of all kinds; The
    transition needs to deliver transformed food systems capable of operating at two
    speeds, i.e., responding to immediate needs and short-term shocks, but also...
  881: Sustainable healthy diets can eliminate a major cause of inequality, reduce
    stunting and wasting in children, reduce diet-related NCDs, reduce greenhouse
    gas emissions, address biodiversity loss, and reduce the economic drag of inadequate
    nutrition.
  901: This page presents a regional-level framework for identifying a science ecosystem
    of support, listing regions and categories of scientific organizations (Academies
    of Sciences, Research & Innovation Institutions, Think-Tanks, Science Bodies/Forums,
    Private Research Organizations).
  919: Ending widespread hunger requires significant resource mobilization; Main costs
    are investment in productivity innovations/people and social safety nets; A significant
    solidarity effort is required for global coordination, especially to support the
    transformation of food systems in low-income countries; No single intervention
    can end malnourishment.
  920: Reducing food loss and waste leads to environmental improvement, but net agricultural
    emissions and AFOLU have a negative impact on forest land; investments in carbon
    farming and ecosystem services are needed.

    various externalities.
  589: Monetization of environmental externalities is based on country-level factors
    for restoration and compensation costs, using the methodology described by Galgani
    et al. (2021). A single median global value from an OECD (2012) meta-study is
    used to monetize the loss of human life. Average values are used to estimate direct
    and indirect economic effects of health loss. The annual estimate is based on
    the most recently available data.
  592: The methodology estimates the 'true costs' of the global food system and alternative
    diets.
  594: The paper discusses True-Cost Accounting (TCA) as a methodology for assessing
    the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of different activities
    (food systems, policies, regions, organizations, investments, or products). TCA
    involves identifying and quantifying externalities, measuring inputs and outputs,
    and translating these into impacts using various models, including Extended Input-Output,
    Computable General Equilibrium, Life-Cycle Accounting (LCA), and Social LCA.

  28: This page primarily discusses actions and targets related to food systems, research
    capacity, and science-policy interfaces. While it mentions a percentage of GDP
    allocation for food-related research, it doesn't explicitly link these actions
    to specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes related to climate change adaptation.
  35: This page discusses the importance of systemic change and innovation in food
    systems but does not directly address specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes
    at a national level.
  55: No relevant information
  90: The study focuses on the affordability and accessibility of healthy diets rather
    than direct macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, but it suggests that food
    insecurity and malnutrition could indirectly impact productivity and economic
    growth.
  92: No relevant information
  123: The authors argue that traditional econometric and machine learning models
    are not suitable for analyzing transformative change because they rely on reduced
    forms and are subject to Lucas' critique. They believe that structural and disaggregated
    models based on strong economic theory are necessary to compare various 'equilibriums'
    under different conditions and policies.
  124: "The model focuses on agrifood systems and their transformation, considering\
    \ aspects of SDG2 (hunger, environmental sustainability, poverty, and smallholders\u2019\
    \ income). The model covers 67 sectors, including 21 food or agri-food products.\
    \ It disaggregates key staples like cassava and key inputs like fertilizers."
  133: The model currently operates under perfect competition, which may lead to optimistic
    views on inequalities. The issue of imperfect competition should be tackled within
    the model, not with complementary analysis outside the model. Systematic datasets
    and causal linkages between production systems and evolution of soil health remain
    scarce. Substitution between manure and mineral fertilizer is not currently integrated.
  134: The analysis focuses on agrifood systems, with a goal of assessing the risk
    associated with these systems using historical events as stress tests. The diagram
    illustrates the interconnectedness of economic, social, and environmental factors
    within the food system.
  140: The study emphasizes the need for policies stimulating investments in carbon
    farming and related payment schemes for ecosystem services.
  146: The plots indicate a decreasing trend (red dashed line) with increasing uncertainty
    (purple shaded area).  The study uses a 'reverse' iso-utility function where the
    origin represents an unachievable utopia (0 PoU and 0 GHG).
  147: The analysis focuses on a specific sub-national region within the DRC and on
    a specific population (vulnerable farmers).
  220: The page emphasizes diversification of production at various levels (field,
    farm, landscape, regional, and food system) including aquaculture and urban farming.
  221: The page focuses on diversification of food systems and income sources as a
    means to enhance resilience and well-being at the household level. It emphasizes
    the importance of considering local and regional natural, socio-economic, and
    cultural conditions in implementing diversification strategies.
  224: The page highlights the importance of integrating national markets into the
    global economy and integrating smallholder farmers into local and regional markets.
  225: The paper acknowledges support by the National Science Foundation (CBET 1855937
    and OISE-2020635) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research
    Foundation).
  246: "This page focuses on the importance of Indigenous Peoples\u2019 food systems\
    \ and their potential role in addressing food security and environmental challenges.\
    \ While it doesn't directly quantify macroeconomic or fiscal impacts, it highlights\
    \ the potential for these systems to contribute to positive outcomes that could\
    \ have economic benefits in the long run, particularly related to resilience and\
    \ adaptation to climate change."
  271: The paper focuses on marginal environments and indigenous people, who are often
    forgotten in academic research, policy studies, or investment. Marginal environments
    are characterized by constrained agricultural potential and resource degradation
    due to biophysical and politico-socio-economic factors.
  273: Highlights the importance of recognizing indigenous people as experts and agents
    of change in securing sustainable livelihoods and healthier lifestyles, rather
    than passive recipients of external technologies. Promotes the use of under-utilized
    or 'forgotten' crops and their knowledge systems.
  295: The page focuses on urban food systems in the Global South. It discusses the
    role of local producers, market intermediaries, and urban consumers, along with
    environmental impacts like waste and pollution.
  384: The paper suggests that changes in demand for animal source foods and related
    trade patterns can have significant environmental consequences, particularly through
    land use changes associated with feed production.
  390: The page references a negative relationship between extensively raised chickens
    and pigs and the GDP per capita of different countries, however, it cites Gilbert
    et al. (2015) for that finding, which is outside the scope of this review. The
    page discusses the uncertain role of smallholders in the future, noting potential
    for sustainably intensified smallholder dairy, but constraints on smallholder
    beef production due to reliance on increased animal numbers. It also argues that
    as economies grow, smallholder monogastric sectors will tend to reduce in importance.
  397: The economic mitigation potential of changing diets is not known and is a crucial
    research area.
  435: The analysis focuses on actions at the global, regional, and national levels
    to close critical gaps and promote necessary investments, policies, and regulations.
  443: Information about pests is generally not accessed by users until a pest has
    reached a damaging stage.
  448: The page focuses on using technology to monitor and manage pest outbreaks,
    mainly the desert locust, which is relevant to understanding the impact of climate-sensitive
    events on agriculture and potentially national economies through food security.
  449: This paper snippet focuses on pest risk prediction systems and improving plant
    health systems, specifically relating to desert locusts. It suggests using early
    warning systems and disseminating information to farmers to mitigate potential
    losses. The main approach seems to be leveraging technology for monitoring, data
    collation, and communication. The text does not include information on the macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal implications of climate change impacts and adaptation.
  459: The paper focuses on food system innovation hubs as a potential solution to
    address malnutrition and achieve SDGs in LMICs. It defines innovation broadly
    to include new products, business models, policy practices, technologies, behavioral
    insights, or ways of delivering products and services.
  463: The page focuses on the role of innovation hubs in improving food systems,
    potentially leading to economic benefits and improved health outcomes; Purposive
    financing and innovative funding mechanisms are needed to attract investments
    from governments and other funding agencies.
  472: The text highlights the need for diversified diets and regenerative agriculture
    practices to bolster ecosystem functions and resilience in agricultural production
    systems.
  486: The paper suggests that retaining habitat within agriculture and the diversity
    of cropping systems per unit area are indicators to the CBD and to UNFSS12. Defines
    that the definition of 'semi-natural' habitats differ for each region, providing
    examples for European analyses (pastures), forest biomes (Agroforests, plantations
    and orchards), and rice fields in California that provide overwintering habitat
    for migratory waterfowl.
  501: Progress on achieving water and sanitation targets of SDG 6 has been unsatisfactory
    and uneven, with implications for economic stability and resource distribution.
  503: Irrigation systems can help buffer seasonal gaps in diets, contributing to
    improved food security and nutritional outcomes
  513: The page primarily focuses on the impact of climate change on food systems
    and nutrition security, outlining various mechanisms through which climate change
    affects food production, access, utilization, and stability. The impact cascades
    to affect the productivity, livelihoods, and incomes of individuals, especially
    those dependent on climate-sensitive sectors.
  520: Investments into land restoration provide opportunities for climate adaptation
    and mitigation through ecosystem services.
  540: The page discusses agroecology, climate change adaptation, and the need for
    systemic approaches but does not provide specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes
    or quantitative data relevant to nation-wide adaptation.
  551: The bond's success hinges on government support from donor countries; environmental,
    social, and governance (ESG) factors make the Crop Trust bond attractive to investors
    focused on Sustainable Development Goals.
  570: Focuses on defining and measuring food loss and waste, but doesn't directly
    address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal impacts of climate change or adaptation.
  587: The paper acknowledges that the methods and data for measuring, valuing, and
    attributing externalities vary greatly in maturity and that there is limited information
    available due to the young nature of TCA, the complexity of food chains and the
    large variety of disciplines and data required.
  589: There is substantial uncertainty in the estimates, particularly for health
    costs due to impact pathways not being extensively studied. The counterfactual
    is not self-evident, and externalities relate more to diets than to products.
    The study acknowledges incomplete coverage of relevant externalities. The uncertainty
    ranges should be interpreted comparatively due to incomplete capture of all uncertainties.
  592: The analysis does not cover the distributional effects of dietary shifts. Several
    limitations are noted regarding the estimation of environmental costs, land use,
    air pollution, food safety, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
  603: The basic plate meets about one-third of daily caloric needs.
  605: The analysis focuses on food price variation and affordability, implying potential
    links to labor productivity and healthcare costs at a national level, indirectly
    affecting macroeconomic outcomes. The study highlights time and fuel use as hidden
    costs of home cooking that influence food affordability.
  624: The analysis considers investments/interventions in primary resources, water
    management, irrigation efficiency, agricultural R&D, soil protection, transport,
    and energy infrastructure.
  625: The study emphasizes interventions like agricultural R&D, infrastructure development,
    market efficiency improvements, and micronutrient supplementation.
  632: The paper discusses investment options such as agricultural R&D, extension
    efforts, improved crop varieties, soil fertility improvements, efficient irrigation
    technologies, market platform and infrastructure improvements, improved storage
    systems, better roads, availability of food processing, equitable food distribution
    systems, electricity access and information and communication technologies.
  635: The magnitude of hunger reduction differs across modelling assessments.
  637: The interventions include enhancing crop yields, improving ICT/infrastructure/trade
    for food distribution, supporting marginal groups, and reducing child malnutrition.
  638: The analysis focuses on lower-middle-income countries and considers interventions
    like agricultural R&D, extension, and irrigation.
  640: The analysis seems to focus on agricultural interventions and their impact
    on poverty and hunger reduction in developing countries, assessing the benefits
    and costs of adaptation practices. The results are extrapolated to 2030.
  641: References AfCFTA (African Continental Free Trade Area) and Doha Development
    Agenda trade negotiations.
  642: Emphasis on the estimation of cost-effectiveness of social protection and nutrition
    interventions during COVID-19.
  644: The analysis focuses on hunger reduction through interventions such as agricultural
    enhancement, irrigation, social protection programs, and addressing crop diseases
    and pests. The intervention strategies are tailored for the African context.
  646: The study acknowledges that the cost estimates might understate the full benefits
    of the investments because lagged benefits and impacts on other development outcomes
    (poverty, child malnutrition, environment) are not considered.
  649: The study does not quantitatively assess the impact of the pandemic or other
    extreme events on the cost of hunger reduction.
  652: The paper acknowledges that the spending priorities of those who could mobilize
    resources seem not sufficiently oriented toward overcoming hunger.
  661: The definition of 'developed' and 'developing' countries varies across datasets,
    so the numbers presented are approximations.
  662: The paper also estimates social assistance expenditures are less than 1.2%
    of GDP, using data from the World Bank's ASPIRE database, focusing on developing
    and emerging countries.
  667: Table shows costs and/or investments related to SDG2 (Ending Hunger) in relation
    to different financing sources and interventions. There's a distinction between
    'Adaptation' and 'Mitigation' in the types of expenditures. The scale is unclear.
  669: Focus is on developing countries, particularly in Africa and Asia (excluding
    China).
  671: Focuses on the role of financial institutions and instruments in promoting
    sustainable agri-food systems and mitigating climate-related financial risks.
    Highlights the importance of addressing market failures in agricultural and climate
    credit markets.
  677: The page focuses on financing SDG2 (ending hunger) rather than climate change
    adaptation directly, but there is some overlap due to the reference to climate-related
    financial disclosures (TCFD) and zero deforestation and emissions policies. However,
    the connection to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks and adaptation costs/benefits
    isn't explicit or quantified on this specific page.
  683: No relevant information
  690: The impact of emissions leakage on global emissions can be positive (emissions
    reallocation) or negative (emissions misallocation), depending on the relative
    emission efficiency of domestic production versus imports.
  692: The page focuses on the impacts of trade and sustainable food systems, particularly
    the trade-offs between food security, environmental impacts (land use, biodiversity),
    and health outcomes. It does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    risks of climate change or costs/benefits of national adaptation, but it does
    touch on environmental consequences with implications for economic sustainability.
  781: The paper discusses China's food system transformation and national food policies
    towards 2035, emphasizing food security and sustainable food systems, but does
    not directly quantify macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks of climate change or
    the costs/benefits of adaptation.
  796: The paper focuses on technological solutions like vertical farms, non-ground
    crop production, robotic greenhouses, and specialized greenhouse complexes adapted
    to permafrost as adaptation strategies.
  802: The page primarily sets the context of the challenge of feeding India's growing
    population in the face of resource constraints and climate change, and provides
    no quantitative data.
  806: India is moving towards an ecosystem-based food system focusing on end-to-end
    solutions including agronomic advice, market linkages, and access to finance.
  810: The passage discusses the impact of agricultural policies and market structures
    on the Indian food system, highlighting inefficiencies and biases. While not explicitly
    quantifying macroeconomic or fiscal impacts of climate change adaptation, it identifies
    factors that hinder the food system's resilience and competitiveness which could
    affect macro-fiscal outcomes.
  828: This page primarily discusses the obstacles to translating scientific advances
    into practical applications, particularly in agriculture, and the impact of differing
    regulations on gene editing for plant breeding. While it alludes to potential
    macroeconomic consequences, it does not directly quantify them. The focus is on
    the regulatory and technological landscape, not on specific macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes related to climate change adaptation.
  829: The page emphasizes the importance of transdisciplinary integration of priorities
    at the science-policy interface across all relevant sectors, including fiscal
    policy, to address complex challenges.
  838: The bioeconomy is linked to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development through
    the SDGs.
  840: The bioeconomy can strengthen local value chains, promoting the reuse and recycling
    of food resources. Strategies for integrating chains and adding value to products
    at the local level contribute to poverty reduction. Advances in biology, ICT,
    and engineering are improving our ability to understand and take full advantage
    of biological resources. Information and communication technologies and digitalization
    are becoming important determinants of the organization and competitiveness of
    economies.
  858: The page discusses the impact of pandemics and pathogens on the food system,
    highlighting potential risks to the workforce, trade, food security, and livelihoods.
    Climate change is mentioned as potentially affecting the range and outbreak frequencies
    of animal and plant diseases and pests.
  880: The transition needs to be affordable at a time when countries are still grappling
    with the economic catastrophe of COVID-19.
  901: This page focuses on identifying relevant scientific resources by region and
    type, rather than directly addressing macroeconomic or fiscal risks or adaptation
    costs/benefits related to climate change. It provides a framework for potentially
    finding information related to those topics.
