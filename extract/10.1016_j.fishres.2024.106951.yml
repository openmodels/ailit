Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increases in temperature, leading to increased weight-at-age but reduced recruitment
    of Pacific cod.
  5: Sea surface temperature (SST) in summer, sea surface or bottom temperature during
    the spawning season (March and April) and summer, ocean pH (surface and bottom)
    during the spawning season.
  10: Increases in temperature leading to lower recruitment of Pacific cod outweighing
    positive effects on weight-at-age
  11: Environmental variables (temperature) impact growth and recruitment. Changes
    over time in natural mortality due to trophic interactions.
  14: future environmental- and climate-driven dynamics
Highlights:
  1: Negative effects on recruitment due to temperature increases outweigh the positive
    effects on weight-at-age. Current harvest control rules may lead to declines in
    biomass, catch, and profits.
  4: No relevant information
  5: Analysis incorporates future climate projections (2023-2099) under different
    emission scenarios (SSP126 and SSP585) and Earth System Models (GFDL-ESM4, CESM-CAM6,
    MIROC-ES2L) to model environmental variables affecting Pacific cod populations.
  10: Current harvest control rules, particularly those assuming no future environmental
    effects, may fail to conserve the Pacific cod stock, leading to declines in biomass
    and catch.
  11: Assessment model configuration is possibly as important, or more so, than the
    environmental scenario.
  14: The probability of spawning biomass dropping below certain thresholds, based
    on different climate scenarios and management strategies, is a key outcome. Increased
    temperature affects growth and recruitment of Pacific cod, potentially increasing
    metabolic demand and mortality, and decreasing prey availability.
Methodology:
  1: Framework for conducting projections that allows for structural model uncertainty
    (in the structure of the population dynamics model, Earth System Models, and emission
    scenarios), for process error in future recruitment, and for uncertainty in the
    parameter estimates of the population dynamics model, applied to Pacific cod in
    the eastern Bering Sea. Projections are based on a harvest control rule that attempts
    to maximize the difference between revenue and variable costs.
  5: Uses dynamically downscaled hindcasts, historical runs, and projections from
    an oceanographic model (Bering10K ROMSNPZ) for the eastern Bering Sea. Models
    consider environmental drivers of population parameters for Pacific cod. Employs
    bias correction methods, specifically a delta-corrected approach.
  10: Uses environmental models and harvest control rules to project the effect of
    different temperature scenarios on spawning biomass and catch of Pacific cod.
    The analysis considers different harvest control rules, including those based
    on FMEY.
  11: Uses assessment model configurations considered by the Scientific and Statistical
    Committee of the US North Pacific Fishery Management Council to create projections
    of an unspecified outcome to 2100 using CEATTLE (Climate-enhanced Age-based model
    with Temperature-specific Trophic Linkages and Energetics) model. The projections
    assume that future recruitment will be distributed about mean recruitment in the
    absence of links between environmental variables and expected recruitment.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on a specific fishery (Pacific cod) and its management, and
    provides a framework for considering climate change in fisheries stock assessments.
    The framework takes into account several sources of uncertainty.
  4: The focus of this paper is stock assessments, and while it uses climate-related
    environmental variables, it does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes at a national level. The methodology focuses on projecting catch series
    under different environmental scenarios, relevant to fisheries management rather
    than national-level economic adaptation.
  5: The focus is on environmental drivers affecting the population of Pacific cod
    in the eastern Bering Sea, using climate models and environmental data to project
    future conditions. Data used includes retained catch, index (survey and CPUE),
    length-composition (fishery and survey), and ages (survey).
  10: The study suggests that climate-aware harvest control rules, such as adjusting
    reference points based on expected recruitment changes, are needed for sustainable
    fishery management. Harvest control rules based on FMEY lead to more conservative
    management outcomes.
  11: Model uncertainty is greater than reflected by the four assessment model configurations
    used for the projections.
  14: updating projections based on climate-enhanced stock assessments and reviewing
    consistency of the relationships between environmental variables and population
    parameters should be a standard part of the assessment process for stocks likely
    to be subject to future environmental and climate-driven dynamics.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Profits for the fishery (revenue minus variable costs).

  14: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: Harvest control rules based on the assumption of no future environmental effects
    on population parameters fail to conserve the stock. Basing future catches on
    the environmental scenario that leads to the poorest outcomes (GFDL ssp585) generally
    keeps the stock above the threshold of 20 % of unfished spawning biomass and achieves
    long-term profits at or greater than those expected in the next ten years.
