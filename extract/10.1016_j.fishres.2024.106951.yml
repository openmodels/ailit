Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increases in temperature, structural model uncertainty (population dynamics model
    structure, Earth System Models, emission scenarios), process error in future recruitment,
    and uncertainty in parameter estimates of the population dynamics model.
  2: Environmental variables are considered to capture variation in biological parameters
    (length of age-1.5 animals, L1.5, and mean recruitment), and future values of
    these variables are based on Earth System Models with high and low emission scenarios.
  3: Environmental variables, choice of harvest control rule, and model configurations
    drive the uncertainty in future catch time-series.
  4: Environmental variables (E) from Earth System Models (ESM) and different emissions
    scenarios impact the parameters of the stock assessment models, which drive future
    catch series projections.
  6: The study considers the impact of fishing mortality (F) on equilibrium catch
    and net revenue.
  7: Summer sea surface temperature (SST), spring bottom temperature, spring surface
    temperature, spring bottom pH, and spring surface pH are considered as potential
    drivers affecting growth (L1.5) and recruitment.
  8: Summer sea surface temperature (SST) is a key environmental driver impacting
    Pacific cod recruitment and subsequent stock health. Different climate scenarios
    (ssp126, ssp585) influence future SST projections and thus the projected impacts
    on Pacific cod.
  9: Summer sea surface temperature (SST) changes under different environmental scenarios
    (ssp126, ssp585) from climate models CESM, GFDL, and MIROC.
  10: Increases in temperature negatively impact recruitment, leading to lower biomass
    levels for Pacific cod.
  11: Potential changes in natural mortality due to trophic interactions; assumptions
    of no environmental links to recruitment.
  12: Summer sea surface temperature (SST) is a driver of risk, impacting growth and
    recruitment.
  13: The environmental variables and population parameters, as determined over the
    period 1977-2022, and assumed to remain constant, are drivers of risk. Warming
    may expand the spawning area of EBS Pacific cod in the southern part of the eastern
    Bering Sea.
  14: Future environmental- and climate-driven dynamics; temperature and pH on growth
    and recruitment of Pacific cod.
  16: Future levels of climate warming.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Impacts on fish populations, specifically Pacific Cod in the eastern Bering Sea,
    considering stock assessments, harvest control rules, biomass, catch, and profits
    for the fishery.
  2: The paper extends the stock assessment for Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) Pacific cod,
    focusing on stock status and catch levels.
  3: The paper evaluates future catch time series.
  4: The evaluation focuses on projecting future catch series in fisheries, influenced
    by environmental variables and assessment model uncertainty.
  6: "The paper evaluates the impact of different harvest control rules (NPFMC Tier\
    \ 3 40\u20135 harvest control rule and a constant FMEY strategy) on fisheries\
    \ management."
  7: The study evaluates future catch and spawning biomass under different climate
    scenarios and harvest control rules.

    temperature) and different assessment model configurations on Pacific cod recruitment,
    spawning biomass, and catches in the eastern Bering Sea.

    surface temperature - SST) on Pacific cod, focusing on spawning biomass and fishery
    profit.
  10: The paper evaluates the impacts of climate change on spawning biomass and catch
    for Pacific cod under various environmental scenarios.
  11: The page discusses projection scenarios for Pacific cod in the Gulf of Alaska
    using different assessment model configurations.
  12: Projected spawning biomass relative to the unfished level is evaluated.
  13: The page evaluates the projection of spawning biomass of EBS Pacific cod.
  14: Probability of spawning biomass dropping below four threshold levels and distribution
    for relative profit for 28 catch time-series.
  16: Declines in biomass and catch for EBS Pacific cod.
Highlights:
  1: Increases in temperature are found to increase weight-at-age but reduce recruitment.
    The negative effects on recruitment outweigh the positive effects on weight-at-age.
    Basing future catches on the environmental scenario that leads to the poorest
    outcomes (GFDL ssp585) generally keeps the stock above the threshold of 20 % of
    unfished spawning biomass.
  2: Including environmental drivers in the assessment does not markedly impact the
    main outputs (e.g., trajectories of spawning biomass and recruitment) because
    these are primarily determined by monitoring data. The future state of the population
    is directly related to assumptions about how population parameters will change
    in relation to the inclusion of forecasted environmental variables.
  3: The framework unifies multiple stock assessment configurations and parameter
    uncertainty. It uses climate scenarios downscaled for the Bering Sea, focusing
    on sea ice performance. It accounts for the uncertainty in parameters, environmental
    drivers, and the earth systems models used for projections of environmental change.
  4: The paper aims to capture parameter as well as model uncertainty in stock assessments
    to provide future catch series projections. Method accounts for uncertainty in
    model structure, environmental variables, and ESM/emissions scenarios.
  6: 'The paper compares two harvest control rules: the current NPFMC Tier 3 rule
    and a constant FMEY strategy, which aims to maximize net revenue.'
  8: Environmental scenarios, even optimistic ones, project spawning biomass below
    the target level by the end of the projection period. The impact of environmental
    scenario on performance metrics is greater than that of assessment model configuration.
  9: Environmental scenarios are a key source of uncertainty. Higher catches (e.g.,
    from MIROC ssp126) can lead to population collapse. Basing future catches on the
    poorest-outcome scenario (GFDL ssp585) keeps the stock generally above the threshold.
    Accounting for parameter uncertainty and process error makes pessimistic scenarios
    less so due to random recruitment deviations.
  10: Current harvest control rules may not conserve the stock if future environmental
    impacts are ignored, suggesting the need for climate-aware management frameworks.
  11: Model uncertainty for EBS Pacific cod is significant, potentially influencing
    assessment outcomes; projections could be overly optimistic due to model assumptions.
  12: Accounting for Earth System Model uncertainty is important in resource analysis
    and management, as differences in projected biomass and catch were found under
    the three environmental models, even under the same emission scenario.
  13: Spawning biomass projections for EBS Pacific cod are sensitive to environmental
    variables.
  14: Updating projections based on climate-enhanced stock assessments and reviewing
    consistency of relationships between environmental variables and population parameters
    should be a standard part of the assessment process for stocks likely to be subject
    to future environmental- and climate-driven dynamics.
  16: Results indicate declines in biomass and catch for EBS Pacific cod, will increase
    with future levels of climate warming, and basing catch limits on the null environmental
    model or MIROC ssp126 (and removing them from the population) is predicted to
    lead to population crash.
Methodology:
  1: A framework for conducting projections that allows for structural model uncertainty,
    process error in future recruitment, and uncertainty in parameter estimates of
    the population dynamics model. Applied to Pacific cod in the eastern Bering Sea,
    with projections based on a harvest control rule that attempts to maximize the
    difference between revenue and variable costs.
  2: The paper uses climate-enhanced stock assessments driven by the outputs of Earth
    System Models. Future catch series are developed based on multiple assessment
    model configurations and Earth System Models/emission scenarios.
  3: The paper presents a framework for incorporating environmental variables and
    their uncertainty into stock assessments and future catch projections. It considers
    multiple stock assessment configurations, parameter uncertainty within configurations,
    and uncertainty in future environmental scenarios from Earth System Models. Projections
    are conducted using harvest control rules based on stock status relative to reference
    points.
  4: "Uses a Bayesian approach (NUTS MCMC algorithm) to sample from posterior distributions\
    \ of model parameters. Assessment Model Configuration is selected using AIC. Projections\
    \ are performed for every 5th vector of parameters. Convergence is defined as\
    \ all effective sample sizes above 500 and \u0302R values less than 1.022."
  6: The analysis uses assessment model configurations with estimated biological parameters,
    stock and recruitment parameters, and catchability parameters. It calculates net
    revenue by considering equilibrium catch and variable fishing costs. The study
    considers time-varying and pre-specified parameters in the assessment models.
    Economic data comes from trawl catcher/processors.
  7: The study uses projections from four assessment model configurations, six environmental
    scenarios (three Earth System Models times two emission scenarios), and two harvest
    control rules. It explores structural uncertainty in climate coupling, structural
    error, and process/parameter uncertainty.
  8: The analysis uses assessment models to project future Pacific cod stock status
    under different climate scenarios and harvest strategies. Recruitments from 1977-2022
    are compared to values predicted from summer sea surface temperature. The analysis
    considers model and parameter uncertainty by using multiple assessment model configurations
    and environmental models.
  9: Uses extended single-species models and projections based on Maximum Likelihood
    Estimates (MLEs) to project future states of the cod stock and fishery under different
    environmental scenarios and catch time-series. Accounts for parameter uncertainty
    via samples from the posterior distribution and process error.
  10: The analysis uses environmental and assessment models to project future biomass
    and catch under different harvest control rules.
  11: Assessment model configurations from the US North Pacific Fishery Management
    Council were considered; projections assume future recruitment without environmental
    links.
  12: Projections are based on catch limits from MIROC ssp126 and GFDL ssp585 scenarios,
    and control rules (40-5 and constant F).
  13: The analysis accounts for parameter uncertainty and process error. It assumes
    stationarity in the relationship between environmental conditions and recruitment.
  14: "Based on a 40\u20135 control rule for projections using a best-fit model accounting\
    \ for parameter uncertainty and future process error; simulations using catch\
    \ limits from different climate models (e.g., MIROC ssp126)."
  16: Projections are undertaken under the assumption of 'set and forget' management.
    Future work should consider the effects of feedback control and scope for climate
    adaptation using management strategy evaluation.
More Notes:
  3: The analysis uses a stock assessment formulation for Eastern Bering Sea Pacific
    cod as an example.
  4: Some parameters were fixed to their maximum likelihood estimates due to poorly
    informed posterior distributions, these are likely less influential than those
    estimated during Bayesian sampling.
  7: The explained variance for environmental drivers is not very high. The analyses
    are based on the environmental model selected using AIC and the null environmental
    model.
  8: The performance of different assessment model configurations varies depending
    on the environmental scenario.
  9: Assessment model configuration has little effect on risk compared to whether
    future catch limits are based on models that account for environmental drivers.
  11: Graphical data indicates comparison of climate models/scenarios impacting Pacific
    cod projections over a timeline from 1980 to 2100.
  12: Model selection approaches were used to select relationships between population
    parameters and environmental variables. Climate change signals only differ significantly
    across models and emission scenarios in the longer-term future (after the mid-21st
    century).
  13: Potential spawning area expansion in the southern Bering Sea is mentioned, contrasting
    with low potential in the northern Bering Sea where Pacific cod have redistributed
    due to recent marine heatwaves. The analysis does not account for biological adaptation
    to climate change.
  14: Increased temperature was found to also be associated with increased metabolic
    demand and mortality, and with decreased availability and energy content of prey.
  16: The projections assume that the harvest in each year will exactly match the
    catch limit outcomes from the harvest control rules.
Quantitative material:
  1: The harvest control rules considered in this paper, particularly those based
    on the assumption of no future environmental effects on population parameters,
    fail to conserve the stock if the inferred catch limits are taken.
  2: Mentions an average landed catch of 200,000 t of EBS Pacific cod during 2013-2022,
    worth USD $162 million per year (2017-2021).
  3: The graph shows a target exploitation rate (F40) is achieved when the relative
    spawning biomass is 0.4 or greater.
  4: Projections are based on 1000 draws from posterior distributions, and MCMC sampling
    used five chains each of length 1200 with the first 200 discarded.
  6: "The paper includes the equation for Net Revenue (NR(F) = \u0303pC(F) - \u03C7\
    F), where \u0303p is the price of cod, C(F) is the equilibrium catch, and \u03C7\
    \ is a factor related to fishing costs. It specifies \u0303p = 1,563 $/t and \u0303\
    c = 66,543 $/d (2019 real dollars) for the eastern Bering Sea cod fishery."
  7: "The table provides \u0394AIC values and AIC weights for models with different\
    \ environmental variables affecting growth and recruitment under different assessment\
    \ model configurations."
  8: R-squared values for the relationship between estimated recruitment and summer
    SST predicted values are provided for four assessment models (R^2 = 0.168, 0.157,
    0.157, 0.117). Projections based on CESM ssp585 and GFDL ssp585 predict the stock
    will drop below 20% of unfished spawning biomass. A target spawning biomass level
    of 40% of the unfished level is mentioned as a benchmark.
  9: Presents posterior distributions for the effect of summer SST on L1.5 (growth)
    and expected recruitment deviations. Mentions probabilities of dropping below
    20% of unfished spawning biomass under different scenarios. Reports percentage
    changes in profit during the last 20 years of the projection period relative to
    the first 10 years.
  10: The analysis provides time-trajectories of spawning biomass and catch from 1977
    to 2099 based on six environmental scenarios.
  11: No specific quantitative information such as percent changes is provided on
    this page.
  12: Distributions (over the 24 environmental scenarios used for projections) for
    the time-trajectory of spawning biomass relative to the unfished level are shown
    in Fig. 8, with median (blue line), 50% distribution (light shaded area), and
    90% distribution (dark shaded area) represented.
  13: The upper right corner of Figure 9 contains bars that reflect the probability
    of being below 20% of unfished spawning biomass (red horizontal line denotes 100%).
  14: Displays medians, 50% intervals, and 90% intervals for relative profit.
  16: Catch limits based GFDF ssp585 generally keeps the stock above the threshold
    of 20% of unfished spawning biomass.
