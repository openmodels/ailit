Drivers of Risk:
  2: Dzud events, sometimes coupled with drought.
  5: Various factors affecting vulnerability to dzud losses, such as resource distribution,
    pasture conditions, lack of preparedness, and institutional arrangements.
  6: Extreme winter weather (dzud), poor forage conditions, limited water supplies,
    overgrazing, incoming livestock from other areas (hoofed dzud), limited natural
    assets, absence of collective action to manage pastures.
  8: Dzud (severe winter disaster), high livestock mortality, and 'hoofed dzud' (high
    concentration of animals due to migration from neighboring regions).
  10: Severe winter disasters (dzud) in Mongolia, leading to livestock loss and economic
    hardship for herders.
  14: Climate disasters (dzud), land fragmentation, land privatization, nationalization,
    poorly designed common pool resource management policies, perverse incentives
    in disaster relief policies.
  15: dzud vulnerability
Highlights:
  2: Identifies factors associated with household and community vulnerability, adaptive
    capacity, and resilience to dzud.
  5: Informal cooperation and collective self-awareness among herders can form a basis
    for better adaptive strategies against winter disasters.
  6: Different soums experienced varying degrees of herd loss due to dzud, influenced
    by factors like pre-dzud pasture and animal conditions, winter preparations, and
    responses to the dzud. Jinst appears to be more resilient due to ample storage,
    reserve pastures, formal collective action among herders and cooperation between
    herders and local government.
  10: Following the dzud, herders considered options like continuing to herd, seeking
    supplementary income, or leaving herding. Some planned to purchase livestock,
    while others would let herds rebuild naturally or focus on livestock quality over
    quantity. A minority planned to move to soum centers or Ulaanbaatar, and some
    sought alternative livelihoods, including in the mining sector. Evidence of social
    learning and adaptive behavior was observed at the community scale.
  14: Individual livestock producers ultimately bear the risk and responsibility for
    dzud preparedness but need access to information, technology, labor, and appropriate
    incentives.
Methodology:
  2: Case studies of four communities' responses to the 2009-2010 dzud; assessing
    herder household and community vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and short-term
    recovery.
  5: Combination of qualitative and quantitative data to construct case studies and
    cross-case analysis, using Student's t-tests, multiple regression, and ANOVA.
  6: Household survey data from four different soums in Mongolia were used to assess
    pre-dzud conditions, preparations, responses, and the impact of the dzud. The
    analysis is a cross-case comparison of vulnerability to dzud in different locations.
  8: Household surveys in 2009 and focus groups.
  10: Survey data was collected from herder households in several soum (districts)
    in Mongolia following a dzud event. Focus group discussions were also conducted.
  15: analysis of the sources of dzud vulnerability
More Notes:
  2: Mongolians identify at least six types of dzud based on the nature of the disaster
    (white, black, hoofed dzud).
  6: The paper provides a case study analysis of vulnerability to dzud in Mongolia,
    focusing on the role of local context, preparedness, and collective action.
  8: The article discusses community-based rangeland management, herder organizations,
    and government initiatives as factors influencing vulnerability and adaptation
    to dzud events. It highlights the importance of collective action, information
    networks, and social capital in coping with disasters. The impact of incoming
    otor herders is also discussed.
  14: The article focuses on dryland livestock systems and climate disaster policy
    in Mongolia, highlighting challenges related to vulnerability and responsibility
    for disaster preparation and recovery.
  15: The paper focuses on dzud (severe winter disasters) in Mongolia.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: The 2009-2010 dzud resulted in approximately 8.5 million livestock deaths, representing
    about 20% of the country's livestock population and affecting 769,000 people,
    or 28% of Mongolia's human population; 220,000 herding households were affected,
    with 44,000 losing all livestock and 164,000 losing more than half.
  6: Percentage of herd lost (SFU) in different soums (Ikhtamir, Undur Ulaan, Jinst,
    Bayantsagaan) due to dzud.
  8: Loss of livestock leads to a lack of dairy products, impacting local food supply.
  10: Herder's plans for recovery following a 'dzud' (severe winter disaster) and
    their impact on household livelihoods and residence.
  14: Permanent loss of livelihoods and food security due to climate disasters.

Quantitative material:
  2: Table provides data on dzud incidence and frequency in Mongolia over 70 years,
    specifying the year, type of disaster (dzud, dzud + drought), frequency within
    a 20-year period, and average interval between events.
  6: Data are provided for herd loss percentages in SFU (Standard Forage Units) for
    each soum, as well as the species most affected (total losses in SFU and percentage
    loss in SFU).
  10: Table 7 presents data on herders' plans for the year immediately following the
    dzud, including where they plan to live, how they expect to make their living,
    and their plans for rebuilding their herd. The data are presented as percentages
    of survey respondents in each soum (district).
