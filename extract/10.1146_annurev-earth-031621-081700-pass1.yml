Drivers of Risk:
  3: The primary driver of risk is the continued emission of CO2 to the atmosphere
    from fossil fuels, cement production, and land-use emissions.
  18: Weakening land carbon sinks due to rising temperatures, increasing respiration,
    drought, declining CO2 fertilization, and potentially sinks transitioning to sources
    at high and low latitudes.
Highlights:
  18: The estimate after applying constraints on models was not identical with the
    ensemble mean, suggesting caution in using the ensemble mean; decreased biospheric
    uptake or release due to feedbacks may be higher than model ensembles suggest.
Methodology:
  3: Earth System Models (ESMs) are used, but the paper acknowledges that simulations
    are challenged to capture all the complex dynamics. The analysis also uses observational
    knowledge of the carbon cycle from timescales of the paleorecord to present-day
    experiments.
  18: Review and discussion of model projections and observational constraints, emphasizing
    the need for systematic application of emergent constraints using global data
    from networks and space-based estimates.
More Notes:
  3: The paper discusses the importance of carbon cycle feedbacks (biogeophysical
    and climate-driven) on atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and the implications of
    net-zero emissions, carbon fluxes, and the airborne fraction.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: No relevant information
  18: Increased difficulty in achieving temperature targets due to nonlinear carbon
    cycle responses, implying increased mitigation costs.
Quantitative material:
  3: The table provides quantitative data on global temperature, atmospheric CO2,
    ocean pH, sea level rise, and global forest area for the years 1960, 2020, 2050,
    and 2100 under specific IPCC emission scenarios.
