Drivers of Risk:
  1: Global climate change affecting water availability in the Ganges sub-basins;
    Growth of water demand.
  2: Climate change impacts on water resources are likely to affect irrigation, power
    generation and the environmental flows in dry seasons, threatening livelihoods
    and long-term sustainable development.
  3: Climate change impacts on water availability leading to water scarcity, affecting
    thermal power plant operations and energy security.
  4: Future climate change conditions, population growth, income levels, economic
    development and activity expansion
  7: Changes in water supply and demand within river basins; specifically, gaps in
    water availability for thermal power plants.
  8: Climate change impacts (specifically water shortages), location of thermal power
    plants in water-stressed areas, increasing water demand (particularly for irrigation
    and domestic use).
Highlights:
  1: Significant water stress is projected for thermal power plants in the Ganges
    sub-basins under climate change, endangering energy security. The paper recommends
    relocation of planned installations from water-stressed areas and adopting less
    water-intensive power generation technologies.
  2: Water demand from irrigation, livestock, domestic, industrial and energy sectors
    as well as the environmental water requirement will increase steadily ranging
    from 34% (in Damodar) to 42% (in Yamuna) in 2050.
  3: The study focuses on the water-energy nexus, specifically the water risks to
    existing and planned power plants due to climate change, using a spatial assessment
    approach and stakeholder consultations.
  4: The existing or the planned thermal power plants which are located in the water-stressed
    areas may face serious water shortage, which impacts on their operational stability.
    Water abundant areas can be considered as locations for the development of new
    energy projects in the future.
  7: Visualizations of water supply-demand gaps in the Chambal, Damodar, and Gandak
    basins, showing potential risks to thermal power plants due to water scarcity.
    Maps show the extent of water stress across the basins, differentiating areas
    with high, moderate, and low supply-demand imbalances.
  8: Water shortages due to climate change pose a significant risk to the operation
    of existing and planned thermal power plants in water-stressed regions of India,
    potentially endangering energy security.
Methodology:
  1: Integrated assessment of the water-energy nexus in the Ganges sub-basins, focusing
    on water stress assessment for thermal power plants up to 2050 under climate change
    conditions using hydrological modelling.
  2: Hydrological modelling for water deficit in 2050 in the Ganges sub-basins.
  3: 'Integrated spatial assessment approach combining hydrological modeling of spatial
    water resource distribution and water demand assessment with field survey data
    from thermal power plants; includes stakeholder consultations; consists of five
    modules: Water Supply, Water Demand, Energy, Water-Energy Nexus Assessment, and
    Water-Energy Nexus Assessment Web Tool.'
  4: Water supply is projected using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) under
    future climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, 2020-2050, MRI-CGCM3). Water
    demand is projected for non-energy sectors (irrigation, livestock, domestic, industry)
    and energy (thermal power generation). A water-energy nexus assessment is performed
    at the district level by subtracting total water demand from total water availability,
    and then classifying the result into water-stressed, moderate water-stressed,
    and water abundant areas.
  7: Spatial mapping and representation of supply-demand gap ratios for water resources
    in different river basins (Chambal, Damodar, Gandak) for the years 2010 and projected
    for 2050.
  8: Integrated approach combining hydrological modelling and water demand projections
    for major water users (agriculture, domestic, industrial, energy, and environmental
    water requirements), as well as power plant field surveys; Results applicable
    to Chambal, Damodar, Gandak and Yamuna sub-basins in India.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the India case study and the Ganges sub-basins (Chambal,
    Damodar, Gandak, and Yamuna).
  2: Forty percent of the existing and planned thermal power plants in Damodar and
    almost all in Gandak and Yamuna are located in water-stressed or moderately water-stressed
    areas which will face high water risks in the future.
  3: The analysis is focused on sub-basins of the Ganges River in India.
  4: The methodology involves downscaling hydrological modeling results to the district
    level based on the area of each district within different Hydrologic Response
    Units (HRUs). A free online tool was developed for spatial visualization of the
    data and results.
  7: The maps project potential water scarcity issues and their impact on power plants
    in specific river basins.
  8: The study highlights the need for energy planning and water management organizations
    as well as investors to consider potential water risks and relocate planned installations
    from water-stressed areas; Gradual transition to more water efficient energy options
    is recommended.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Energy security in India is endangered due to water stress affecting thermal
    power plants.
  2: No relevant information
  3: Water security and energy security are linked, impacting economic activities
    that rely on both.
  4: No relevant information
  7: Potential water supply-demand gaps affecting thermal power plants.
  8: Operational stability of thermal power plants and thus endanger energy security.
Quantitative material:
  1: Water availability will increase by 13%, 33%, 21% and 28% in the Chambal, Damodar,
    Gandak and Yamuna sub-basins, respectively, in 2050 compared with 2010 under RCP
    4.5; Yamuna will have 25% less water in the dry season in the 2050s; Water deficit
    in 30/40 districts in Yamuna and 18/33 districts in Gandak in 2050 under RCP 4.5;
    40% of existing/planned thermal power plants in Damodar and almost all in Gandak
    and Yamuna will face high water risks.
  2: Overall water availability in Chambal, Damodar, Gandak and Yamuna will increase
    by 13%, 33%, 21% and 28%, respectively, in 2050; however, it will vary across
    seasons and locations.
  4: The ratio of water supply-demand balance is calculated at the district level
    by dividing the water supply-demand balance by the total water availability. The
    ratios are further classified into three categories, i.e. water-stressed area
    with the ratio value ranging between (-, 0], moderate water-stressed area with
    the ratio value ranging between (0, 0.5] and water abundant area with the ratio
    value ranging between (0.5, +)
  7: Supply-demand gap ratios are quantified and visualized through color-coded maps
    (red, orange, yellow, light yellow).
  8: 40% of existing and planned thermal power plants in Damodar and almost all in
    Gandak and Yamuna will face serious water stress in 2050; 18 out of 33 districts
    in Gandak and 30 out of 40 districts in Yamuna will face serious water stress
    in 2050.
