Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Oceanic-atmospheric variations such as El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a events, storm\
    \ intensification, extreme events like high-intensity waves and storm surges,\
    \ rising sea levels, socioeconomic development, and relative sea-level change."
  2: "Climate change amplifying El Ni\xF1o impacts; Local sea-level rise; Changes\
    \ in the intensity and frequency of extreme events; Coastal hazards; Poor planning;\
    \ Socioeconomic challenges; Changes in marine dynamics; Coastal urban sprawl;\
    \ Glacier melting due to global warming; Ocean thermal expansion; Higher sea surface\
    \ temperatures"
  11: Rising sea surface temperatures increasing tropical and extratropical storms,
    leading to more extreme wave events; warm-core tropical cyclones and cold-core
    extratropical cyclones; atmospheric pressure, cyclone speed, direction, and scale;
    friction with the seabed and coastal shape; changes in the seabed; human interventions
    along the coast.
  20: Rising sea levels, increased intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones, concurrent
    extreme events of precipitation and meteorological tides.
  24: Oceanic and atmospheric variations, population growth in low-lying areas, extreme
    events (storms, intense waves), rapid sea-level rise, cyclonic tides, changes
    in wave energy and direction.
Highlights:
  1: Intensified erosive processes on sandy beaches are expected due to climate change,
    posing significant economic losses and risks to coastal populations in Latin America.
  2: "Assessments in highly impacted coastal areas should account for climate change\u2019\
    s impact on ENSO and other climatic phenomena such as Pacific Decadal Oscillation\
    \ (PDO). It is also essential to evaluate climate change\u2019s role in local\
    \ sea-level rise and changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme events."
  11: High-intensity wave systems, combined with elevated water levels, are closely
    linked to warm-core tropical cyclones and cold-core extratropical cyclones, increasing
    the destructive potential of coastal flooding.
  20: Chile projects economic losses in tourism due to beach erosion. Rising sea levels
    and extreme weather events are key drivers. Shoreline retreat simulations under
    RCP8.5 project losses of over $5 million by 2050 and $10 million by 2100.
  24: Projected increase in frequency of extreme events under RCP8.5 emissions scenario
    will heighten coastal risks, particularly coastal erosion.
Methodology:
  1: Systematic review of 130 research papers analyzing historical trends and projections
    of coastal erosion and oceanic-atmospheric variations.
  11: Case studies throughout the continental Latin American region.
  20: Simulations and projections are used to model shoreline retreat under different
    RCP scenarios (2.6 and 8.5) and different years.
  24: General Circulation Models (GCMs) used for past and future climate change projections,
    downscaling techniques used to address limitations in regional coastal climates,
    but the process poses challenges due to varying levels of expertise in Latin American
    countries.
More Notes:
  2: "The systematic review aims to explore the historical evolution and projected\
    \ trends of oceanic\u2013atmospheric variations related to coastal erosion in\
    \ sandy coastlines in continental Latin America, alongside addressing the challenges\
    \ posed by coastal degradation."
  11: The paper focuses on physical drivers of risk and population exposure in Latin
    America, but doesn't directly quantify macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes or adaptation
    costs/benefits.
  20: The population increase in flood-prone areas in Latin America mentioned is not
    directly attributable to this paper, but cited from another source. The paper
    also notes a risk of coastal area loss due to sea-level rise in Latin America
    which it cites from another source.
  24: Impacts of coastal erosion are not uniform across the region. The paper highlights
    the interconnectedness of various factors contributing to vulnerability, as shown
    in the flowcharts.

  20: Economic losses in Chile due to reduction in beach width are estimated at over
    USD 5 million per year by 2050, and over USD 10 million per year by 2100 under
    the RCP8.5 scenario; shoreline retreat of 2.00m to 13.00m is projected by 2050,
    and one of 10.00 m to 53.00 m by 2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario in Chile; Cassino
    Beach in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, simulations projected for the year 2030 show
    average shoreline retreats of 3.60 m for the RCP2.6 scenario, increasing to 42.80
    m for RCP8.5
  24: Sea-level rise rates exceeding global averages in Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico,
    and Peru during certain periods.
