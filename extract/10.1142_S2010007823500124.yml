Drivers of Risk:
  8: Climate change impacts on family farming in the North and Northeast of Brazil,
    specifically considering IPCC-AR6 (2021) scenarios.
  9: Climate change is a global phenomenon unequivocally influenced by human activities
    with regionally distinct manifestations; data on historical patterns and future
    climate variables to the North and Northeast are presented to better understand
    regional risks.
  14: Projected increases in maximum and minimum temperatures; projected changes in
    rainfall patterns (reduction in some regions, increase in others); greater uncertainty
    in rainfall projections compared to temperature projections.
  15: Temperature rise, more droughts, increased evapotranspiration, more heatwaves,
    and greater variability in rainfall are drivers of risk.
  16: Climate change impacts causing regional disparities and affecting agricultural
    productivity, especially in the North and Northeast regions of Brazil.
  17: Regions whose economies are heavily dependent on agriculture will face greater
    losses.
  18: Climate change represented by IPCC-AR5 (2013) scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5;
    Changes in the historical pattern of temperature and rainfall
  19: 'Climate change under two scenarios: RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5.'
  20: Changes in historical patterns of temperature and rainfall impact the productivity
    and land values in Brazilian agriculture.
  21: Low productivity in family farming is linked to limited investment in technological
    innovation, creating a technological gap and making regions vulnerable to climate
    change.
  25: Greater frequency and intensity of droughts
  26: Climate change causing agricultural losses; changes in hydroclimatic cycles;
    deforestation and forest degradation; fires; legal and illegal economic activities
    (wood extraction, mining, agriculture, and livestock practices).
  32: Temperature rise and rainfall reduction; Longer and more frequent heat waves
    and droughts; Forest fires and floods (North); Increased desertification (Northeast);
    Higher risk of savannization of the Amazon rainforest.
  33: Gender discrimination limits women's access to public policies and resources,
    making them more vulnerable to climate change, with increased burden during climate
    crises due to their role in family and community.

Highlights:
  8: Family farming in Brazil has resilience factors like efficient use of family
    labor, traditional knowledge, diverse agricultural systems, creole seeds, and
    contribution to biodiversity conservation. The paper aims to discuss climate change
    impacts and present coping recommendations for sustainable family farming in the
    specified regions of Brazil.
  14: Rainfall variability is expected to increase in the Northern and Northeast regions.
    There is greater uncertainty regarding rainfall projections compared to temperature
    projections. Temperature increases are projected for the North and Northeast regions
    under both SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios.
  15: Climate change impacts like reduced water and food security, health problems,
    and compromised socioeconomic and human development in North and Northeast regions
    are significant highlights.
  16: The North and Northeast regions of Brazil will face significant GDP impacts
    due to climate change, increasing existing socioeconomic disparities.
  17: Regions like the Northeast and Midwest in Brazil will experience significant
    GDP losses due to climate change impacts on agriculture.
  18: Family farmers are more vulnerable to climate change; Negative impacts on productivity
    are greater in family farming than in large-scale agriculture; Expected losses
    for agriculture would have an equally negative and cumulative impact on the rest
    of the economy; The crops for which steep falls were estimated at productivity
    levels (cassava, beans, maize, coffee beans, and cotton) are more relevant in
    local agricultural production in the most affected states.
  19: Climate change is projected to have a negative impact on agricultural productivity
    in many Northeastern and Northern Brazilian states, with some states experiencing
    up to a 100% decrease in productivity under the RCP 8.5 scenario for family farming.
    The impacts vary significantly between states and between family farming and commercial
    agriculture.
  20: The negative effects of climate change are more significant in regions with
    lower levels of agricultural productivity, with the North and Northeast regions
    being more impaired than the national average.
  21: Regions with family farming are vulnerable to climate change due to technological
    gaps between family farms and large-scale agriculture.
  32: Climate change impacts on family farming in the North and Northeast regions
    lead to harvest losses, water/food insecurity, increased poverty, and migration.
  33: Improving the responsiveness of family farmers is an essential prerequisite
    for reducing the impacts of climate change.

Methodology:
  8: Literature review and analytical synthesis focusing on climate change impacts
    on family farming in the North and Northeast of Brazil. The study considers IPCC-AR6
    (2021) scenarios.
  9: Past behavior (1986-2014) and future simulations in three periods (2016-2045,
    2046-2075, and 2076-2100) of the minimum and maximum temperature variables, as
    well as the average accumulated rainfall for the four seasons of the year in the
    North and Northeast regions of Brazil.
  14: The analysis uses the NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 dataset (2021) to project future temperature
    and rainfall changes. The temperature data is visualized via a line graph for
    the time span of 2016-2100, however, the paper does not make clear if this data
    comes directly from NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 or from modelling the data.
  16: Simulation of agricultural productivity shocks impacts on regional GDP.
  17: Analysis is derived from models based on the results of Nazareth, Cunha, and
    Gurgel (2020).
  18: Productivity shock and macroeconomic impact simulations for the period from
    2021 to 2050
  19: "The analysis appears to be based on modelling results, specifically projecting\
    \ the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity under different climate\
    \ scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5). The results presented are apparently based\
    \ on the results of Tanure, Domingues, and Magalh\xE3es (2024)."
  21: No specific methodology for the analysis is discussed on this page.

More Notes:
  8: The study builds upon and expands the research of Machado Filho et al. (2016),
    which used IPCC-AR5 (2013) data. The paper divides Brazil into the North (Amazon
    rainforest) and Northeast (Caatinga, Cerrado, Atlantic Forest).
  9: The information is spatialized to allow local policymakers more detailed climate
    trends, and thus think of strategies to minimize the predicted adverse effects.
  14: The paper focuses on regional climate change projections. It references another
    study for detailed findings on specific biomes.
  18: Focuses on Brazil as a whole, with particular attention to the North and Northeast
    regions; Identifies specific crops particularly vulnerable in family farming (cassava,
    beans, banana, and maize) and large-scale agriculture (maize, cotton, and orange).
  19: The page focuses solely on the agricultural sector and does not provide a comprehensive
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal assessment. The data is disaggregated at the state
    level within Brazil's Northeastern and Northern regions.
  21: The page emphasizes barriers hindering technological adoption in family farming,
    particularly in Brazil's North and Northeast, which impacts productivity and increases
    vulnerability to climate change. Specific quantitative data from the Agricultural
    Census 2017 is included but not detailed in the provided extract.
  26: The paper focuses on the vulnerability of specific populations (traditional
    peoples, women) to climate change impacts and highlights the role of gender inequality
    in the field of climate crisis.
  33: Adaptation strategies include adoption of sustainable agricultural techniques,
    diversification of crops, soil management techniques using organic fertilization,
    integrated pest management, access to updated climate information and technologies,
    strengthening cooperation networks, and promotion of public policies supporting
    agroecological production.

    from climate change; difficulties in daily life of riverine communities due to
    changes in hydroclimatic cycles.
  32: Climate change negatively affects food production, causing food security impairment
    and increasing rural poverty; Pressure on natural resources (water, soils, flora,
    fauna) leads to biodiversity loss; Weakens regional economy and the quality of
    life of the population; Aggravated vulnerability of migrant families.
  33: Climate change threatens poverty reduction and improvement of living conditions
    associated with economic gains and environmental conservation.
