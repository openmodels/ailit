Highlights:
  2: The interplay between climate change and the food system is highlighted as a
    cycle where the food system is both vulnerable to and a driver of climate change,
    exacerbating food insecurity.
  3: "Climate change acts as a \"threat multiplier\" for food-insecure communities,\
    \ threatening crop yields, food supply, raising prices, and reducing growers\u2019\
    \ incomes."
  5: Provision of hydrometeorological, climatological, and agronomic support requires
    data across time and space scales to inform stakeholders.
  6: Human adaptations to climate changes are evident at plant-to-field scales, particularly
    in irrigation and plant breeding.
  8: The FEWS NET model is highlighted as an example of successful implementation
    of food security early warning and has guided programmed humanitarian assistance
    to lessen the impacts of food insecurity since 1985. The importance of stakeholder
    engagement and incorporating user needs into research (O2R) is emphasized.
  9: Highlights the importance of coproduction and iterative engagement between researchers
    and users to ensure climate research addresses real-world challenges. Also points
    out the value of prototypes and testbeds as tools for effective communication
    and knowledge transfer.
  11: Models are crucial for food security applications, but predictability of precipitation
    at S2S time scales is generally low; there is a need for improved process understanding
    and process representation; recent methodological advancements have dramatically
    improved the ability to detect and attribute the signature of anthropogenic climate
    change in extreme climate events
  12: Droughts can trigger cascading events and feedback loops, exacerbating the initial
    hazard. Drought-induced crop losses can lead to food spikes across the world.
    Systemic risks disproportionately impact the poor and marginalized.
  13: Effective early warning enables early action and weather and climate information
    play crucial roles in supporting anticipatory humanitarian action that saves lives
    and livelihoods, reduces losses and damages, and enhances food security. FbF has
    been successfully used to save lives and livelihoods, reduce losses and damages,
    and support the resilience of local communities. Weather, climate and water-related
    science and services can play a crucial role in achieving the SDGs by 2030.
Methodology:
  4: The paper discusses the use of agroclimatic information derived from observations
    and reanalyses for supporting food security decision-making and impacts assessments.
  5: Analysis includes choosing states and fluxes relevant to food security, balancing
    physical relevance with data observability, predictability, and availability.
  6: The paper presents a framework for understanding agricultural decision-making
    in relation to meteorological phenomena, incorporating both spatial and temporal
    scales. It shows how stakeholders weigh multiple temporal and spatial scales in
    decision processes. It also highlights the need for physically and socially robust
    data.
  7: The paper discusses monitoring tools and observational data (meteorological data,
    satellite observations, reanalyses) used to contextualize anomalies and provide
    forecasts for food security outlooks at different time horizons (6-9 months before,
    within 6 months of, and within 3 months of a growing season). It mentions expert
    interpretation of monitored and forecast conditions.
  8: The methodology involves using forecasts and Earth system monitoring tools from
    various agencies to analyze current conditions and their anticipated effects on
