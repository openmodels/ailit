  9: No relevant information
Drivers of Risk:
  5: Changes in land use and climate affect the quantity and quality of water.
  10: Extreme weather events; limited funding for open-source data during humanitarian
    crises; inaccessibility of data to users.
  12: Droughts, heat waves, cascading climate-related events, poverty, rapid urbanization,
    weak governance, decline of ecosystems, compounding hazards, systemic vulnerabilities,
    geopolitical and socioeconomic challenges.
  15: Rising emissions and the impacts of climate change
Highlights:
  10: Emphasizes the need for two-way knowledge transfer between scientists and humanitarian
    actors to ensure the sustainability of humanitarian efforts and improve global
    food security.
  15: Achieving global food security will require interdisciplinary collaboration
    and a new generation of scientists, practitioners, program directors, policy makers,
    and decision-makers trained across disciplines to address the complex challenge.
Methodology:
  5: The paper discusses using models (water-stress models, agricultural water demand
    models, crop water requirements models, genetic-by-environment models, crop/livestock/socioeconomic
    models) and data across time and space scales (nowcasts to multidecadal predictions,
    plant to global scales) to inform stakeholders across their decision time and
    space horizons.
  10: Development and implementation of testbeds for knowledge exchange between researchers
    and humanitarian decision-makers, using an iterative, agile-inspired approach
    for product development and verification.
More Notes:
  5: The page discusses the importance of matching models and information sources
    with the spatiotemporal requirements of specific decision processes related to
    food security. It also mentions that agriculture and land use changes can impact
    land-surface atmosphere interactions, and alter climate variability.
  10: The described framework aims to improve the operability, verification, visualization,
    and accessibility of decision-support products in the food security space, particularly
    in lower-income countries. It focuses on building capacity and fostering collaboration
    between researchers and practitioners.
  15: The paper emphasizes the role of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) in
    advancing global food security by promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and
    knowledge transfer. It advocates for breaking down silos between academic disciplines
    and integrating food security users and decision-makers.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  5: Food security.
  10: Global food security
  12: Food price spikes, food insecurity, famine, social unrest, employment rates,
    international trade, price volatility, food-related conflict, lives lost, livelihoods
    lost, impoverishment.
  15: Global food security and the livelihoods of vulnerable communities
Quantitative material:
  12: 828 million people across the world are hungry (according to the UN World Food
    Programme (WFP 2022)).
