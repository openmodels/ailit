Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change impacting hydropower generation, leading to electricity supply
    constraints and economic damage.
  3: Hydropower's dependency on climate conditions, with the risk arising from systematically
    drier conditions under climate change leading to potential failure in achieving
    NDCs.
  5: Climate impacts on hydropower, unreliability of the power system, use of coal
    (CO2 intensive), intermittency of renewable energy, lack of energy efficiency
    progress.
  6: Climate change impacts on hydropower generation due to altered water availability
    and capacity factors.
  7: Delays in power plant construction projects (Shilands, Gwanda, Hwange 7 and 8,
    Hwange 1 and 2 life extension, Batoka)
  9: Climate change is identified as a threat to Zimbabwe's energy future, impacting
    energy production and potentially leading to macroeconomic risks.
  10: Low rainfall and drought are causing food shortages and power cuts.
  11: Projected long-term droughts leading to reduced hydropower generation, failure
    to meet electricity demand with current NDC investments, climate change.
  12: Hydropower investments in the NDC scenario leading to exposure to water shortages
    due to a drying climate; overdependence on hydropower causing short-term energy
    shortages.
  13: Climate change impacts are a driver of risk, influencing the effectiveness of
    NDCs. The choice of energy sources (coal vs. clean) and adaptation strategies
    also drives risk.
  14: Climate change impacts on energy supply (specifically hydropower); need for
    market and institutional restructuring for clean adaptation.
  15: Inaction on climate change adaptation; a fossil fuel-dependent future.
  16: Dry climate futures; Climate change; Lack of climate resilience plan; Reactive
    coal-based reinforcement.
  17: Lack of aggressive action regarding Zimbabwe's Nationally Determined Contributions
    (NDCs) may lead to economic and environmental costs.
  22: The drivers of risk are the different climate scenarios (V3, V4, V5) based on
    various GCMs and emissions pathways (RCPs, A2, A1B).
Highlights:
  2: A shift from historical electricity market structures holds potential for environmental,
    cost, and reliability gains.
  3: Hydropower is expected to contribute significantly to emissions reduction, but
    climate change-induced droughts pose a risk to this expectation.
  6: The paper investigates whether a country's NDC future exposes its economy or
    emissions trajectory to risks if the climate were to change.
  7: The preferred System Development Plan (SDP) for Zimbabwe includes investments
    in various power plants with a total NPV of 6541 Million USD. Several projects
    within the SDP have experienced delays.
  9: The main highlight is the projected impact of different energy scenarios on Zimbabwe's
    energy production and consumption, particularly the contrast between scenarios
    with and without climate change considerations.
  10: Zimbabwe's electricity system is vulnerable to a changing climate, with both
    hydropower and coal-powered plants facing challenges due to water scarcity during
    droughts. Regional water shortages will limit Zimbabwe's ability to import electricity.
    Deforestation is accelerated by drought due to reliance on biomass for cooking.
    The NDC infrastructure, if built out, will also be affected under future climates.
  11: Inaction leads to unmet electricity demand. Coal reinforcement avoids economic
    damage but misses NDC targets. Clean adaptation is economically sensible and has
    low carbon emissions but requires aggressive policy action.
  12: Economic damage from inaction is more than double the cost of adaptation; clean
    adaptation balances the system with renewables, leading to lower emissions and
    reduced economic costs.
  13: Climate change puts NDCs at risk. Adaptation strategies, particularly the choice
    between coal and clean energy, significantly affect future energy capacity and
    other outcomes. Clean energy adaptation seems to perform better than coal adaptation
    in some scenarios, and both perform better than no adaptation.
  14: "Clean adaptation has marginally lower direct costs than coal adaptation. Clean\
    \ adaptation requires significant investment in renewable energy to overcome low\
    \ capacity factors. Emissions are lower than the NDC\u2013\u2018No Adaptation\u2019\
    \ future, and significantly lower than the \u2018Coal Adaptation\u2019 future."
  15: Clean adaptation with NDCs is lower cost and lower emitting at a national level.
    Inaction is dangerous and will damage the economy. A fossil future is highly emitting.
  16: Climate proofing NDCs and exceeding mitigation targets is potentially economically
    beneficial, but aiming to meet NDC targets with no climate resilience plan is
    economically dangerous.
  17: Without aggressive climate action, Zimbabwe risks billions of USD in economic
    damage and livelihood loss. Clean adaptation requires commitment, political will,
    and power sector restructuring. Key policy recommendations include specific identification
    of PAMs with detailed cost-benefit analysis.
Methodology:
  2: Uses the Open-Source energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS) to consider adaptation
    pathways for Zimbabwe's power sector.
  5: Scenarios are developed and quantified using the Open-Source energy Modelling
    SYStem (OSeMOSYS), a bottom-up, technology rich, linear programming, energy systems
    model.
  6: The study uses the OSeMOSYS model to develop a least-cost energy system configuration.
    It builds hypothetical NDC scenarios based on national System Development Plans
    and NDC submissions, then subjects these scenarios to climate futures by altering
    water availability for hydro generation. It also considers adaptation strategies
    using coal or a mix of renewables and energy efficiency.
  7: Scenario analysis comparing a fossil fuel future with the System Development
    Plan (SDP) and its updated version (SDP+) to project future power generation capacity
    and costs.
  9: The analysis uses simulations to project Zimbabwe's energy future under different
    scenarios, including a scenario where there are zero emissions immediately after
    the full exploitation of the Devils Gorge hydro station (for the electricity sector
    only).
  10: The analysis uses publicly available climate projections from the World Bank
    ECRAI study. Downscaled rainfall data is used to calculate projected runoff, which
    is then allocated to different uses across the Zambezi basin. Hydropower production
    data from the water systems model are fed into an energy systems model of Zimbabwe,
    which then runs an optimization routine to estimate an electric energy price trajectory
    for the reference case infrastructure. Three relatively dry climate futures from
    the CMIP5 scenarios are selected to focus on risks to achieving the NDCs.
  11: 'The paper considers three scenarios: inaction, coal reinforcement, and clean
    adaptation, assuming NDC investments are pursued. It models electricity production
    under selected future climates.'
  12: The analysis is based on future capacities, power generation, and emissions
    from the electricity system under different scenarios, including NDC investments
    and adaptive actions, considering different future climates.
  13: The analysis uses projections based on a GISS-E2-H climate future to assess
    risks to NDCs. Stacked area charts, line graphs, and bar charts display the results
    of these projections.
  14: "Compares different adaptation scenarios (NDC\u2013no adaptation, coal adaptation,\
    \ clean adaptation) using modeling to project energy production, consumption,\
    \ and emissions from 2010 to 2050."
  16: Proof-of-concept analysis using selected dry climate futures; Limited scenario
    calibration based on best available existing studies.
  17: Model assumes a perfect market for new renewables and hydropower investment
    and changes in operation, but acknowledges the market is imperfect and needs restructuring.
    Suggests a roadmap and milestone approach for implementing clean adaptation policies
    and measures (PAMs), including appraisal, testing, and evaluation.
  20: The analysis uses the Open-Source energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS).
  22: The analysis uses a scenario-based approach, exploring different energy/environmental
    strategies under various climate conditions and policy responses, possibly with
    downscaled climate data (UCT, Princeton-BCSD). The analysis is based on climate
    projections from CMIP3 and CMIP5.
More Notes:
  3: The paper focuses on evaluating risks to Zimbabwe's NDCs from climate change
    and exploring options to enhance their resilience.
  6: The study uses a scenario approach, comparing a 'Fossil Future', 'SDP+' and 'NDC'
    scenario, adapting demand projections from the System Development Plan. The objective
    function of OSeMOSYS is to develop a least cost energy system configuration, subject
    to various expansion and operational constraints.
  9: The simulations appear to focus heavily on the electricity sector and the implications
    of different energy production choices (hydro, solar, coal, etc.). The 'zero emissions'
    scenario after the Devils Gorge exploitation is noteworthy.
  11: The paper considers supplementing NDC investments with coal, or transitioning
    to clean adaptation through larger quantities of solar and wind power and deep
    energy efficiency cuts. Enhanced electricity trade between power pools and hydrosystems
    in different basins is another option that requires stronger political ambition.
  13: The legend provides detail on the types of energy sources. The repeated use
    of 'NDC' suggests this is a core component of the analysis, and the charts seem
    to be comparing different adaptation pathways relative to those NDCs. The paper
    considers adaptation at a national level.
  14: The analysis does not account for market and institutional restructuring costs
    associated with clean adaptation. The role of regional power trade in mitigating
    climate change impacts is highlighted, but not analyzed in this paper.
  16: Analysis is limited by climate runs, scenario calibration, missing detail for
    policy formulation, structural changes, technology characteristics, regional market
    design, pan-water basin analysis, and no assessment of ecosystem nor institutional
    requirements.
  17: Deep changes in hydropower operation are needed, moving beyond baseload generation.
    Deep energy efficiency adoption is also crucial. Policy analysis needs to incorporate
    climate vulnerability.
  20: The paper provides links to data and code used in the analysis, increasing transparency
    and reproducibility.
  22: The scenario tree and grid diagram illustrate a framework for analyzing the
    impacts of different climate scenarios and adaptation strategies, focusing on
    Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and comparing them with business-as-usual
    approaches. The paper seems to model several adaptation strategies with an NDC
    scenario using climate predictions.
