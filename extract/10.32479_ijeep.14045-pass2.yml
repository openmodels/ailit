Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change impacts international tourism through changes in precipitation,
    temperature, and carbon dioxide emissions.
  3: Sea level rise, water scarcity, extreme weather events like heat waves, flash
    floods, and sand storms in Egypt due to climate change.
  5: Climate change, specifically temperature increases and coral reef degradation
    due to high temperatures.
  7: Variables considered include CO2 emissions, precipitation, mean temperature,
    global domestic investment, land, and residuals.
  8: Average annual temperatures, gross capital formation, percentage of arable land,
    carbon dioxide emissions, rainfall
  9: Climate change indicators, gross capital formation
  10: Carbon dioxide emissions have a significant negative long-term impact on international
    tourism revenues. Temperature and rainfall also impact tourism, with potential
    benefits from rising temperatures in the Mediterranean region.
Highlights:
  2: Carbon dioxide emissions have a long-term negative impact on international tourism
    revenues in Egypt.
  3: The tourism industry is severely affected by both COVID-19 and climate change,
    with climate change effects being long-lasting.
  5: Climate change negatively affects international tourism in Egypt, resulting in
    significant revenue losses.
  7: The model is considered statistically significant with an R-squared of 0.71 and
    a significant F-statistic.
  8: An increase in carbon dioxide emissions is associated with a significant decrease
    in international tourism in the long run.
  9: There is a cointegration relationship between climate change indicators and international
    tourism within the study model, implying that environmental changes have an impact
    on international tourism revenues.
  10: Carbon dioxide emissions negatively affect tourism revenues. Increased capital
    formation positively impacts tourism revenues. Rising temperatures may benefit
    tourism in some regions like the Mediterranean.
Methodology:
  2: An autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is used to investigate the short
    and long-term impacts of climate variables on tourism in Egypt.
  5: The study models international tourism revenues as a function of climate variables
    (temperature, precipitation, and CO2 emissions). It incorporates more than one
    variable to represent climate change.
  7: Uses ARDL bounds test of cointegration and an error correction model (ECM) to
    examine long-run relationships, with variables tested for stationarity.
  8: Bounds testing is used to determine the presence of cointegration between variables.
  9: Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is used to examine the impact of
    climate change on international tourism in Egypt from 1990 to 2020. Includes short-run
    relationship and error correction model.
  10: Cointegration analysis is used to model the relationship between the international
    tourism index and independent variables. The study uses an unrestricted error
    correction model and applies ARCH and LM tests.
More Notes:
  2: The page does not provide details on costs or benefits of nation-wide climate
    adaptation measures.
  5: The study attempts to investigate the extent to which climate change affects
    international tourism in Egypt by distinguishing itself from previous studies.
  8: "The Theil Inequality Coefficient is around 0.034, reflecting the model\u2019\
    s ability to predict."
  10: The paper focuses on Egypt's tourism sector and the impact of climate change
    on it. The study acknowledges that climate change has a long-term impact on tourism
    through tourist seasons and tourist attractions.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes related to adaptation are provided
    on this page.
  3: The tourism sector's contribution to GDP in Egypt fell from 8.5% in 2019 to 4.3%
    in 2020 before rising to 5.1% in 2021.
  5: Negative impact on international tourism revenues in Egypt.
  7: The model explains approximately 71% of changes in international tourism.
  8: International tourism index
  9: International tourism revenues
  10: Tourism revenues are affected by climate change (carbon dioxide emissions, temperature,
    rainfall), capital formation, and GDP.
Quantitative material:
  2: No specific quantitative information on economic outcomes of interest is provided
    on this page.
  3: Tourist arrivals in Egypt fell from 9.24 million in 2019 to approximately 4 million
    in 2020-2021, a 56.7% decrease.
  5: Forecasted 20% decrease in annual tourist arrivals for Egypt by 2060, reducing
    tourism revenues by 13-17 billion pounds annually. Estimated tourism losses of
    19 billion pounds in 2030 and 85 billion pounds in 2060 due to coral reef degradation.
  7: The ARDL model estimation shows coefficients for variables like CO2 emissions,
    precipitation, mean temperature, and their lagged values.
  8: The model's R-squared is 0.84, indicating that 84% of the changes in international
    tourism are explained by the changes in independent variables.
  9: Error correction model estimates with coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics,
    and probabilities for various factors influencing tourism revenues (LRCPT, LCO2,
    LTASMEAN, LGDITOTL, LLAND). R-squared and adjusted R-squared values are also provided.
  10: 1% increase in capital formation increases tourism revenues by 1.37%. Tourism-related
    investments accounted for only 0.7% of total capital investments in 2019 and 2020
    in Egypt. Total GHG emissions increased by 31% between 2005 and 2015, with CO2
    emissions accounting for 73% of total emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions have
    increased by 141.93% since 1990.
