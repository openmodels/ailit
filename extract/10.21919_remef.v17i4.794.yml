Drivers of Risk:
  1: Rising temperatures, droughts, extreme rainfall, and rising sea levels leading
    to increased frequency and severity of extreme events.
  5: Climate change impacts include rising temperatures, sea level rise, more intense
    wildfires, droughts, and extreme weather events like floods and storms.
  6: Increase in average temperatures, more frequent and intense extreme weather events
    like storms, droughts, and wildfires.
  9: Water shortages, changes in renewable energy performance, higher temperatures,
    heat waves, extreme climatic occurrences, sea level rise, health effects.
  12: No relevant information
  14: High exposure or sensitivity to climate impacts in economic sectors.
  15: Climate change, increasing global warming.
Highlights:
  1: Without immediate action, adaptation to climate change will be more difficult
    and costly, particularly for the most vulnerable social groups and economic activities
    and ecosystems in the North American region.
  5: Increasing frequency and intensity of climate change risks in North America are
    leading to permanent modifications to ecosystems, increased property risk along
    coasts, and greater vulnerability for indigenous people and urban areas.
  6: Mexican GDP per capita could fall by 7% to 12% due to climate change; significant
    declines in agricultural yields expected.
  9: Climate change has and it will continue to have significant differentiated impact
    in North America. Mexico was the largest tourism economy in the high vulnerable
    group of countries.
  12: No relevant information
  14: Adaptation has received less attention than mitigation in national responses
    to climate change, particularly in the U.S. and Mexico.
  15: Societies face a critical moment in North America due to climate change impacts
    and limited adaptation. Early adaptation actions have significant economic benefits.
    Negative consequences of inaction are already high and will continue to increase,
    particularly for the most vulnerable groups. A new approach to decision-making
    mainstreaming adaptation to climate change in development policies is an essential
    step.
Methodology:
  1: Reflection on evidence produced by Working Group 2 of the IPCC AR6 report on
    Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability, based on impact and adaptation assessments
    revised in the available literature.
  9: Large dimensional intertemporal CGE trade model used by Kompas, et al. (2018)
    to account for the various effects of global warming on GDP growth for 139 countries
    by decade and over the long run.

More Notes:
  1: The paper emphasizes the need for further research into subnational impacts of
    climate change, particularly in Mexico.
  12: This paper focuses on the impacts of climate change on North American cities,
    particularly concerning infrastructure investment and adaptation plans. It does
    not provide explicit nation-wide macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risk assessments
    or cost/benefit analyses of adaptation at a national level, but it does speak
    to the broader implications of urbanization and the need for increased investment
    in resilient infrastructure.
  14: Mexico has a national climate change legislation and strategy in place, but
    there have been limited achievements in adaptation implementation.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic and financial dimensions of climate change impacts and adaptation for
    North America are highlighted.
  5: The impacts of climate change on North America include severe damage to local
    economies, ecosystems, and social systems from extreme weather, which might stress
    economic sectors and cause housing and infrastructure damage.
  6: Potential GDP growth impact in Mexico, with a reduction between 7% to 12% due
    to climate change.
  9: GDP, productivity, business investment, tourism revenue.
  12: No relevant information
  14: Extreme events have damaged economically important supply-chain infrastructure
    and disrupted regional and international trade, increased public expenditures
    on emergency and recovery response, and affected property and financial market.
  15: Declining yields in economic activities, aggravating conditions in social wellbeing,
    increasing degradation of ecosystem.
Quantitative material:
  6: Potential reduction of seasonal corn production yields between 30% and 40% in
    certain Mexican states by the end of the century.
  9: Kompas et al. (2018) show Canada would experience minor negative effects on GDP
    percentage change per year (-0.218), the U.S. a higher effect (-0.622) and Mexico
    (2.277) in the long run.
