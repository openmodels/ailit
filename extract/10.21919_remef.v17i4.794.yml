Drivers of Risk:
  1: Rising temperatures, droughts, extreme rainfall, and rising sea levels.
  2: Extreme events (heat waves, drouth, extreme precipitation, hurricanes, etc.)
    have increased since the 1950s and they are projected to continue to increase
    according to the level of future warming; compound extreme events (i.e. drought
    and heatwaves) have also increased in recent decades.
  4: Shifted rainfall patterns and dramatic warming in the Arctic.
  5: Rising average air temperature, longer growing seasons, sea level rise, longer
    and more intense wildfire seasons, disastrous droughts, extreme weather events
    (floods, storms, droughts, heat waves, and wildfires), increased frequency and
    intensity of climate change.
  6: Increase in average temperatures, increase in warm nights and decrease in cold
    nights, extreme events (tropical storms, hurricanes, fires, heat waves), changes
    in precipitation, rising sea levels, acidification of the oceans.
  7: Impacts include storms, severe thunderstorms, hurricanes, and droughts.
  8: Heatwaves, drought, storms, extreme precipitation, decline in snow and ice, wildfires,
    windstorm frequency and intensity associated with tropical storms, ice or freezing
    rain.
  9: Higher temperatures, heat waves, extreme climatic occurrences, sea level rise,
    changes in frequency and intensity of extreme weather
  10: No relevant information
  11: Droughts, floods, warming temperatures, rising carbon dioxide levels, heat waves,
    changes in water temperature and acidification, precipitation.
  14: High exposure or sensitivity to climate impacts results in larger losses and
    adaptation costs for economically important sectors.
  15: Attributes limited adaptation efforts to lack of strong institutions, financial
    resources, inclusive governance, and political leadership.
Evaluation overview:

    USA, Mexico), with a focus on economic and financial dimensions.
  2: No relevant information
  4: Climate change impacts in North America.
  5: Impacts of climate change in North America, particularly on ecosystems, housing,
    infrastructure, economic sectors, livelihoods, health, and social systems.
  6: Impacts of climate change on ecosystems, biodiversity, and society in North America
    with a focus on Mexico.
  7: The paper discusses economic losses due to storms, hurricanes, tropical storms,
    and droughts in the U.S.
  8: The challenge of climate change for economic growth in North America.
  9: Productivity and investment effects on GDP, performance of renewable energy,
    tourism
  10: No relevant information
  11: Food production; Infrastructure and cities; Suicide rates
  14: Evaluation highlights uneven impacts on key economic sectors, financial markets,
    government budgets, and household welfare due to climate impacts in North America.
  15: Highlights declining yields in economic activities, worsening social wellbeing
    conditions, and increasing ecosystem degradation due to climate change in North
    America.
Highlights:
  1: Increasing frequency and severity of extreme events throughout North America;
    Without immediate action, adaptation to climate change will be more difficult
    and costly, particularly for the most vulnerable social groups and economic activities
    and ecosystems; Need to delve into the impacts of climate change at the subnational
    level in the North American region and in Mexico.
  2: Global warming is occurring faster than anticipated in recent years and it is
    a phenomenon without precedents in the last 2000 years; every increase in global
    warning will cause more changes in the mean temperature, precipitation, and soil
    humidity in regions of the world and every ton of CO2 emissions increases global
    warming.
  5: North America has seen severe damage to local economies, ecosystems, and social
    systems from recent extreme weather.
  6: Extreme events are becoming more intense and frequent in North America, posing
    significant threats to future climate change adaptation.
  7: Droughts and heat waves cause significant economic losses and are expected to
    occur more frequently due to climate change, impacting agriculture and increasing
    wildfire risks.
  8: Climate change threatens North American aquatic ecology, water quality, water
    availability for human uses, and flood exposure. Observed climate impacts illustrate
    current vulnerability of energy facilities. Drought has significantly affected
    the snowpack and melting patterns in the West part of the U.S., limiting hydroelectric
    power generation. Water shortages can also affect cooling systems of thermoelectric
    plants in the West part of the U.S. and Northern Mexico. Damage to electricity
    distribution is expected to growth in areas projected to experience more ice or
    freezing rain (Canada) or wildfires (Western U.S. and Mexico); windstorm frequency
    and intensity associated with tropical storms (U.S. and Mexico).
  10: This paper found no comprehensive assessment of the health implications of climate
    change at the national and subnation level in the three countries (US, Mexico,
    Canada) despite the cascading effect of the health implications of climate change
    and the economic and social consequences.
  11: Climate change may make it more challenging to cultivate crops, raise livestock,
    and catch fish in the same locations and ways as in the past; infrastructure is
    vital to economic health and social wellbeing.
  14: Subnational actions in North America are varied, with Canada having a balanced
    approach while the U.S. and Mexico have inconsistent adaptation actions influenced
    by political and ideological factors.
  15: Emphasizes negative consequences of inaction due to climate change, particularly
    for vulnerable groups, and notes early adaptation actions have significant economic
    benefits.
Methodology:
  1: Reflection on the evidence recently produced by the Working Group 2 of the IPCC,
    based on impacts and adaptation assessments revised in the available literature
    on the topic.
  2: This article summarizes key messages of IPCC Sixth Assessment Reports and presents
    selected data and information of North America as a context.
  8: Focuses on observed climate change impacts and projected risks in key sectors
    highlighted in IPCC reports.
  10: No relevant information
More Notes:
  1: The article is a reflection on the IPCC AR6 report and seeks to highlight the
    economic and financial dimension of climate change impacts and adaptation in North
    America. It also suggests future research should focus on subnational impacts
    in North America and Mexico.
  2: The paper focuses on climate change implications in North America and its economic
    dimension, using IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report as a basis.
  4: This page provides a general overview of climate change in North America, its
    causes, and some observed impacts. It sets the stage for a broader discussion
    but doesn't delve into specific impact evaluations.
  5: Indigenous people and urban areas will remain more vulnerable than others to
    climate-change impacts. Settlement continues to accelerate along coasts, increasing
    the monetary value of the property at risk.
  6: Focuses on the impacts in Mexico, although it provides an overview of climate
    change in North America. Mentions the impact of extreme events, sea level rise,
    and ocean acidification.
  8: Mentions sectors of energy, industry, food system, health, and key infrastructure
    and cities as key sectors to focus on.
  9: This paper discusses the differentiated impact of climate change in North America,
    with impacts expected to increase for the frequency and intensity of extreme weather
    in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.
  10: The paper highlights that research on mental health implications of climate
    change has received little attention in Mexico.
  11: The text emphasizes the importance of considering climate change impacts alongside
    other factors influencing agricultural production, such as farming practices and
    technology.
  14: Despite established policies, Mexico faces a gap between adaptation planning
    and implementation, especially at the local level, needing more attention to adaptation.
Qualitative material:
  14: IPCC's high confidence that extreme events have disrupted supply-chain infrastructure
    and trade, increased public expenditures on emergency recovery, and affected property
    and financial markets.
Quantitative material:
  2: No relevant information
  5: Growing season has gotten longer in Canada and the US by around two days every
    decade since 1950.
  6: "Average temperatures in Mexico have increased approximately 0.85\xB0C above\
    \ the registered climatological normal. Between 2015 and 2039, the average annual\
    \ temperature in the country is expected to have increased by 1.5\xB0C and 2\xB0\
    C in the north of the territory. States such as Jalisco, the State of Mexico,\
    \ Nayarit, Morelos, Michoac\xE1n, Guerrero and Colima could lose between 30 and\
    \ 40% of their seasonal corn production yields by the end of the century. Average\
    \ sea level can rise between 20, 40 or even 60 centimeters. Decrease in pH of\
    \ oceans on the Pacific coast of 0.5."
  7: Storms account for 805 billion USD in total losses and 454 billion USD in insured
    losses since 1980, and thunderstorms caused 180 billion USD of insured losses
    between 1980 and 2011.
  8: None
  9: Canada would experience minor negative effects on GDP percentage change per year
    (-0.218), the U.S. a higher effect (-0.622) and Mexico (2.277) in the long run.
