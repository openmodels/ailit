Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased frequency and intensity of very wet monsoon seasons due to global warming.
  3: "Very wet monsoon seasons, classified as 1-in-10-years events or seasons within\
    \ the range of the five wettest seasons in 1965\u20132015."
  4: Increased variability and general increase in mean seasonal summer rainfall in
    the Indian monsoon region under unabated climate change (SSP5-8.5)
  5: Increase of very wet Indian summer monsoon (ISM) seasons due to climate change
    (SSP5-8.5, SSP2-4.5, and SSP1-2.6 scenarios).
  6: 'Increased frequency of very wet Indian summer monsoon (ISM) seasons due to climate
    change under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): SSP1-2.6 (sustainable
    development), SSP2-4.5 (modest mitigation), and SSP5-8.5 (unabated climate change).'
  8: Increased frequency and severity of very strong Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) rainfall
    seasons, shifts from light to moderate/heavy rainfall days, and population growth
    in India are identified as risk drivers.
Highlights:
  1: "Projected occurrence of very wet monsoon seasons 8 times more often by 2050\u2013\
    2100 under SSP5-8.5 compared to 1965\u20132015; Reducing to 6 times more with\
    \ SSP2-4.5."
  3: Under scenario SSP5-8.5, an increase in seasonal mean precipitation from 5.6
    mm/day to 6.8 mm/day is observed on average, and in SSP2-4.5, it increases to
    6.3 mm/day averaging over all models.
  4: Significant increase beyond observed natural variability emerges in 2027, which
    accelerates non-linearly; The Himalayan region, Bangladesh, the west coast and
    central India are projected to intensify most in terms of monsoon seasonal rainfall.
  5: "A clear, general increase of the yearly ISM rainfall between 1965-2015 and 2050\u2013\
    2100 toward wetter seasons is found. Under SSP5-8.5, the increasing trend becomes\
    \ significant in 2027."
  6: The study projects an increase in the number of very wet ISM seasons in the future
    (2050-2100) under various climate change scenarios compared to the 1965-2015 baseline.
  8: Climate models project a clear change toward wetter seasons in India with an
    increase in the severity and frequency of very strong rainfall seasons. Even modest
    climate change mitigation efforts can substantially reduce the frequency of very
    strong rainfall seasons.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis performed using the latest generation of coupled climate models and
    shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP5-8.5 and SSP2-4.5).
  3: "Analysis performed using different climate models over historical and future\
    \ periods; changes in seasonal precipitation compared between 1965\u20132015 and\
    \ 2050\u20132100."
  4: Analysis is performed using CMIP6 models and focuses on rainfall patterns. Results
    are applicable to the period 2050-2100, compared to the historical period 1965-2015.
  5: Uses 32 CMIP6 models to analyze the future frequency of very strong rainfall
    seasons. Results apply to the period between 1965-2015 and 2050-2100.
  6: Climate model projections under different SSP scenarios were used to simulate
    future ISM seasons and determine the frequency of very wet seasons. Models are
    classified based on their ability to represent the ISM in historical simulations
    (blue bars for better representation, orange bars for less ability).
  8: "Analysis uses 32 CMIP6 climate models to project changes in very wet ISM seasons\
    \ between 1965\u20132015 and 2050\u20132100 under SSP5-8.5, SSP2-4.5 and SSP1-2.6\
    \ scenarios."
More Notes:
  4: The study focuses on rainfall and does not include the impact of evaporation
    on water availability.
  5: The number of wet days (>0.1 mm) is projected to increase in most of the Indian
    monsoon region, particularly in Northwest India. The number of days with light
    rainfall (10 mm > x > 0.1 mm) in each season is projected to decrease, particularly
    in Bangladesh and North of the Himalayan mountains as well as the West coast of
    India. In Pakistan, the number is projected to increase.
  6: The figure presents model-specific results, allowing for an assessment of the
    range of projections and the influence of model performance on the projected changes
    in ISM behavior. No data available for GFDL-CM4 (GC) in SSP1-2.6.
  8: The paper acknowledges that using only one ensemble member per model neglects
    the contribution of internal model variability. The models also cannot be regarded
    as independent.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Severe floods from very wet monsoon seasons have significant impacts on Indian
    food production and GDP.
  4: No relevant information
  5: No relevant information
  6: Not explicitly mentioned but implicitly related to economic costs and benefits
    of adapting to increased frequency of very wet monsoon seasons.
  8: Food security in India is a potential outcome of interest.
Quantitative material:
  4: The increase in rainfall is to 6.2 mm/day in SSP1-2.6; The standard deviation
    increases in SSP5-8.5
  6: Projected increase in the number of very wet ISM seasons by the second half of
    the 21st century (2050-2100) compared to the 1965-2015 baseline, with a full segment
    representing 50 out of 50 seasons projected to be very wet. The cyan circle represents
    the reference period of 1965-2015, in which by definition 5 seasons exceed the
    90%-percentile of that period.
  8: Very wet seasons projected to increase from 5 out of 50 years (1965-2015) to
    39 out of 50 years (2050-2100) under SSP5-8.5 and to 29 out of 50 years under
    SSP2-4.5.
