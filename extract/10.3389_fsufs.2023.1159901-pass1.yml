Drivers of Risk:
  1: Droughts (increased intensity, duration, and frequency); specifically consecutive
    two-year regional droughts.
  2: Future drought projections in Southern Africa.
  3: Drought results in reduced food supply, increased food prices, and reduced agricultural
    income and purchasing power in southern Africa.
  6: Droughts
  7: Drought, population growth, income growth, relative price changes.
  8: Drought events, decreased regional maize production (by more than 21%).
  9: Changes in population and income influence food security; low crop productivity
    coupled with small changes in crop area in southern Africa
  10: Recurrent droughts; prices being delinked from world markets; drought impact
    on crop yields (maize, cassava, bean).
  11: Recurrent droughts introduce volatility in maize trade and make it difficult
    for policy-makers to adequately respond.
  13: Regional consecutive droughts in southern Africa.
  14: Drought, which impacts crop production and food security.
  15: Drought conditions negatively impact agricultural productivity across multiple
    crops.
  16: Drought in South Africa and Angola.
  17: Droughts
  18: Regional two-year droughts in southern Africa.
  19: Two-year droughts
Highlights:
  1: Recurrent droughts would worsen food security by severely affecting the production
    of maize, the key staple food in the region. Southern Africa would not become
    wealthy enough to mitigate food insecurity by 2040 even with moderate economic
    growth and no drought.
  2: The study aims to quantify the bio-economic impact of future droughts in southern
    Africa to support disaster policies.
  3: In Zimbabwe, despite smaller real food prices in 2016, more than 25% of the population
    was food insecure after two consecutive drought years.
  6: Droughts significantly impact crop production and yield across Southern African
    countries, with varying effects depending on the crop and country. Maize production
    experiences substantial declines in most countries. Some crops, like Tobacco in
    Madagascar and South Africa, may see production increases in certain regions.
    Food price changes and food insecurity levels also vary across countries following
    droughts.
  8: Droughts are projected to increase national food prices and the number of people
    at risk of hunger.
  9: The region would become more import-dependent for its key staple food groups,
    namely cereals, roots & tubers, vegetable oils and meat.
  10: Recurrent droughts will significantly impact agricultural production, especially
    maize. Cowpea, a drought-tolerant pulse, experiences increased production under
    drought conditions. Drought impact will shift the acreage of various crops in
    affected areas.
  11: Droughts worsen food insecurity across southern Africa by reducing food availability
    and consumption; Net maize exports would generally be smaller in volume compared
    to a scenario involving no drought.
  13: Most countries in southern Africa (except Angola, Botswana, Madagascar, and
    Zambia) are projected to experience at least a 10% increase in the number of people
    at risk during the droughts of 2021/22 and 2026/27.
  14: Model validation suggests IMPACT can make reliable projections, though some
    discrepancies exist due to model assumptions not fully reflecting socio-economic
    factors affecting crop production.
  15: Drought scenarios lead to lower production indices across all assessed crops
    compared to base scenarios.
  16: Drought significantly reduces maize production in both South Africa and Angola.
    Angola is more susceptible to drought impacts on maize than South Africa.
  17: Shows fluctuations in the number of people at risk over time, with a significant
    increase towards the end of the period; Percentage of people at risk fluctuates,
    with a noticeable rise observed in the later years.
  18: Droughts are projected to negatively impact the production of various crops
    in southern Africa between 2020 and 2040.
  19: Two-year droughts are projected to significantly impact food security in southern
    Africa between 2024 and 2040, with the highest risks between 2028 and 2032. Countries
    should diversify away from maize as a staple food to enhance food security under
    drought. Promoting the consumption of drought-tolerant crops such as cowpea and
    cassava may enhance food security.
Methodology:
  1: Bio-economic modeling using an adjusted version of the International Model for
    the Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT), version 3.2.
    Projections are made to 2040.
  2: Simulation of the impact of future droughts on food security in southern Africa.
    Identification of plausible pathways for enhancing regional food security under
    drought. The study will quantify the bio-economic impact of future droughts in
    southern Africa.
  3: A bio-economic modeling approach is used, combining crop, climate, hydrology,
    and economic models to project production, consumption, and food security in southern
    Africa under drought scenarios.
  6: "Computations using data on production and harvested area from FAOSTAT (2018)\
    \ to estimate crop yield penalties; yield/acreage penalty = % change in yield/acreage\
    \ in drought years relative to non-drought years. Food price change calculated\
    \ from FAOSTAT (2018) using FPI and CPI indices; Price change from drought = ((Defl.\
    \ FPI 2016 \u2013 Defl. FPI base)/ (Defl. FPI base))*100; Defl. FPI base = (FPI\
    \ base)*(CPI Base); Defl. FPI 2016 = (FPI 2016)*(CPI 2016). Food insecure pop\
    \ (%) = percentage of population which was food insecure by June 2016 after 2\
    \ consecutive drought years using data on number of food insecure people from\
    \ Southern African Development Community (2016) and population data from World\
    \ Bank (2018). Different drought and non-drought years are specified for each\
    \ country."
  7: The IMPACT model is used to project agricultural production, consumption, and
    trade, considering crop yields, irrigated water availability, population and income
    growth. Drought effects are incorporated as exogenous shocks to crop yields and/or
    acreage. Food security is estimated using equations and coefficients from Fischer
    et al. (2005).
  8: Uses the IMPACT model, a partial equilibrium model, to simulate the effects of
    drought on food prices and food security. Drought frequency between 2000 and 2016
    is used to project future drought occurrences between 2020 and 2035. For Malawi,
    Zimbabwe and Zambia, the drought effects of tobacco are modeled by looking at
    'other crops'.
  9: Projections on food production, food consumption, and food security in southern
    Africa under a scenario involving moderate economic growth and no drought from
    2010 to 2040.
  10: Agricultural economic modeling projecting the impacts of recurrent droughts
    on crop production and food security under a 'moderate economic growth' scenario.
    The analysis considers 'no drought' scenarios as a baseline and drought scenarios
    to compare and contrast the implications of drought.

More Notes:
  1: The study identifies measures to enhance food security under droughts, including
    breeding for stress-resilient maize, promoting crop and diet diversification,
    and investing in rainwater harvesting. These measures are adaptation strategies.
  6: The analysis is based on specific drought years for each country, making the
    results applicable to similar drought conditions in those regions. The food insecurity
    data is specifically for June 2016 after two consecutive drought years.
  8: IMPACT does not capture indirect effects of droughts on the industrial and service
    sectors, potentially underestimating the effects on food insecurity. The model
    also incorporates observed price effects, reflecting policy measures for disaster
    management.
  9: No relevant information
  10: The analysis distinguishes between traded and non-traded commodities and the
    effect of local prices being delinked from global markets. It also shows varying
    impacts on different countries within the Southern Africa region based on crop
    specializations and drought severity.
  11: South Africa, the largest maize producer and exporter in the region, can trigger
    maize imports by the region if hit by drought.
  14: Farmers in Malawi appear to reallocate acreage and manage crops better during
    droughts compared to Zambia, leading to different production outcomes.
  15: Graphs indicate that drought has a consistent negative impact on agricultural
    productivity, suggesting a need for adaptation strategies.
  16: The study validates the model by comparing simulated food insecurity results
    with past reported data.
  17: The paper focuses on Southern Africa; The population at risk of hunger is specifically
    due to droughts.
  18: The study focuses on the agricultural sector and does not directly quantify
    macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, but rather agricultural production levels.
  19: The study focuses on the impact of droughts on food security, with no explicit
    analysis of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. The projections are based on the
    IMPACT 3.2 model. The study identifies specific countries and timeframes most
    at risk. The authors suggest adaptation strategies such as diversifying away from
    maize and promoting drought-tolerant crops.
