Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate, environment, and socio-economic factors
  4: Changing nature of climate and weather; increasing anomalies in climate, weather
    events.
  8: Increased rainfall and temperature variabilities; changes in long-term precipitation
    (LTP) and long-term temperature (LTT).
  9: Long-term precipitation, rainfall variability, long-term mean temperature, and
    temperature variability are used as measures of climate change impacting TFP.
  10: This paper considers land elevation and weather regimes/zones (Arid & semiarid,
    Tropical & subtropical, Temperate) as drivers.
  12: Long-term change in climate represented by a 30-year moving average of annual
    mean temperature (LTT) and annual total rainfall (LTP), along with annual variations
    in temperature and total rainfall, impact agricultural efficiency.
  13: The drivers of risk include changes in annual rainfall and temperature variabilities,
    and changes in long-term precipitation (LTP) and long-term temperature (LTT).
  16: Increasing temperature and volatility in climatic variables are negatively affecting
    TFP growth.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Global agricultural productivity growth
  4: Agricultural productivity, sustainability of the farming system, and poverty
    reduction are being evaluated.
  8: No relevant information
  9: Global agricultural TFP (total factor productivity) change and its components,
    including technical efficiency, scale efficiency, and mix-efficiency changes are
    the outcomes being evaluated.
  10: This page evaluates Total Factor Productivity (TFP) change and its components
    (technical efficiency, scale efficiency, mix-efficiency).
  12: The paper evaluates the impact of climate change on Total Factor Productivity
    (TFP), technical-, scale-, and mix-efficiency in agriculture.
  13: The paper evaluates the impact of climate change on Total Factor Productivity
    (TFP) in agriculture.
  16: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: Not specified on this page, but the study investigates the drivers of global
    agricultural productivity growth.
  4: Increased TFP can ensure increased agricultural production while reducing environmental
    externalities, which is also important for increasing the resilience and ensuring
    sustainability of the farming system.
  8: No relevant information
  9: The global TFP grew annually at a rate of 0.44%. Climate variables are used as
    drivers of TFP.
  10: High-income countries had the highest index values for TFP change and its components
    except for the mix-efficiency change index. Crop diversification positively contributes
    towards TFP growth, technical-, and mix-efficiency changes.
  12: Climatic vulnerability due to increases in LTP and LTT contributes negatively
    to agricultural efficiency, with temperature changes significantly affecting yield.
  13: Global agriculture has maintained a positive TFP growth rate over four and a
    half decades. Climate variabilities reduce TFP from its potential rate of change.
  16: Country and region-specific research and policies to mitigate and adapt to climate
    change should be prioritized; crop insurance and technology adoption are potential
    solutions.
Methodology:
  1: Not specified on this page, but presumably detailed in the full article (Land,
    11(4), 512 (2022))
  4: Examination of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) change to decompose total production
    growth into components like technology, efficiency, and scale changes.
  5: The study aims to identify influences of climate change, the natural production
    environment, and socio-economic factors on global agricultural productivity growth
    and conduct predictive analysis on future climate variability impacts.
  8: 'Four models are used: a counterfactual model with natural growth rates, a model
    with added rainfall and temperature variability, a model with added LTP and LTT
    changes, and a model with both. Explanatory variables include technology, institutional
    capacity, socio-economic factors, agro-ecological factors, and climatic variables.'
  9: A 30-year moving average (starting from 1901) is used to calculate long-term
    precipitation and temperature. The annual temperature variability is estimated
    as the difference between monthly maximum and minimum average temperature. An
    MVTOBIT model is used to estimate the determinants of TFP change and its components.
  10: The analysis uses a one-way ANOVA test to determine if TFP change indices across
    categories are significantly different (found to be significant at a 1% level).
    The study also uses econometric analysis to examine the impacts of crop diversification
    on TFP.
  12: The analysis incorporates climate variables and measures their impact on TFP
    and efficiency components using regression equations and calculated marginal effects.
  13: The analysis uses a MVTOBIT model to predict TFP up to 2033 under four different
    climatic scenarios. The model is based on parameter estimates and historical data
    (1969-2013).

Quantitative material:
  1: 'Potentially in the full article, accessible via DOI: 10.3390/land11040512'
  8: 1% additional change in total rainfall and mean temperature variabilities annually;
    0.1% additional change in LTP and LTT annually.
  9: Global TFP grew annually at a rate of 0.44%, and the estimated level was 0.20.
    The global technical efficiency level was estimated at 0.91, scale efficiency
    level at 0.97, mix-efficiency level at 0.78, residual-scale-efficiency level at
    0.37, and residual-mix-efficiency level at 0.29, respectively.
  10: The table provides geometric means of TFP change and its components for different
    categories (income classes, land elevation, weather regime/zone, region/geographic
    location).  For example, low elevation countries have a TFP change index of 0.851,
    while medium elevation countries have a TFP change index of 1.147.
  12: A 1% increase in LTP is associated with a 0.021% reduction in technical efficiency
    and a 0.004% increase in scale efficiency; a 1% increase in LTT is associated
    with a 0.056% decrease in TFP, a 0.011% decrease in technical efficiency, and
    a 0.013% decrease in mix efficiency.
  13: Predicted TFP in 2033 is higher compared to 2013 under four climate scenarios.
    A counterfactual model (no additional climate variabilities) shows higher TFP
    increases. Additional climatic variabilities reduce TFP from its natural rate
    of change (e.g., a 1% change in rainfall and temperature variabilities results
    in a -0.431% mean difference in TFP compared to the counterfactual model).
