Drivers of Risk:
  3: Long-term and short-term climatic factors, natural production environments, and
    socio-economic factors. Specifically, increased climate variability is projected
    to reduce future agricultural productivity.
  7: Changes in climatic variables.
  9: Long-term precipitation (LTP), Rainfall variability, Long-term mean temperature
    (LTT), Temperature variability.
  10: Income classes, Land Elevation, Weather Regime/Zone, Region/Geographic Location,
    Crop diversification.
  11: Crop diversification, Land elevation, Square of land elevation, Arid and semiarid
    climate, Tropical and subtropical climate, LTP (Long-Term Precipitation?), Rainfall
    variability, LTT (Long-Term Temperature?), Temperature variability, Regional/Geographic
    location (SSA, SA, ECA, LAC, EAP)
  12: Long-term changes in climate (30-year moving average of annual mean temperature
    (LTT) and annual total rainfall (LTP)), Annual variations in total rainfall and
    mean temperature, Land elevation
  13: Climate variabilities (changes in annual rainfall, temperature, long-term precipitation
    (LTP), and long-term temperature (LTT)).
  14: Land elevation, weather regime, temperature, rainfall variability, and climate
    change.
Highlights:
  3: Technological progress and mix-efficiency change drove agricultural productivity
    growth, while climate and natural environments reduced it.
  7: Predicts future TFP under different climatic scenarios using a sensitivity analysis.
  9: Complementary relationships exist amongst TFP and its three efficiency components.
  10: TFP change and its components vary significantly across different income classes,
    land elevations, weather regimes/zones, and regions/geographic locations. Crop
    diversification positively contributes towards TFP growth, technical-, and mix-efficiency
    changes.
  11: Climatic variables (Rainfall variability, Temperature variability, LTT) have
    a statistically significant negative impact on TFP change, Technical Efficiency,
    and Mix-Efficiency. Land elevation has a statistically significant effect on TFP
    Change.
  12: Increasing LTP is associated with a decrease in technical efficiency and an
    increase in scale efficiency. Increasing LTT is associated with decreases in TFP,
    technical efficiency, and mix efficiency.  There is a non-linear relationship
    between land elevation and TFP, scale-efficiency, technical and mix efficiency.
  13: Additional climate variabilities significantly reduce TFP from its natural rate
    of change.
  14: Increasing temperature reduces agricultural TFP growth. Rainfall variability
    reduces agricultural TFP growth. Agricultural spending on R&D has a positive effect
    on TFP. Future climate change is likely to have a growth-reducing role on TFP.
Methodology:
  3: "Panel data analysis of 104 countries covering 1969-2013 using a F\xE4re\u2013\
    Primont TFP index and multivariate Tobit model."
  7: Multivariate Tobit model (MVTOBIT) to identify the determinants/drivers jointly
    influencing agricultural TFP and its efficiency components. Out-of-sample forecasting
    using annual compound growth rates of explanatory variables.
  9: MVTOBIT model is applied to estimate the determinants of TFP change and its efficiency
    components.
  10: The analysis uses a one-way ANOVA test to determine if TFP change differs significantly
    across country categories. The analysis also includes econometric analysis to
    explain TFP growth and its components across different income classes. Geometric
    means are used to represent TFP changes across different categories.
  11: MVTOBIT (Multivariate Tobit) model is used to jointly estimate the determinants
    of TFP change and its components. The model includes technology enhancing, institutional
    capacity, socio-economic, production environment, weather regime, climatic, and
    regional/geographic location variables. Results apply to agricultural Total Factor
    Productivity.
  12: 'The study incorporates four variables to represent climate change: two capturing
    long-term changes in climate (LTT and LTP) and two capturing annual variations
    in total rainfall and mean temperature. The analysis also considers land elevation
    and squared land elevation as explanatory variables.'
  13: The paper uses an MVTOBIT model to predict TFP up to 2033 under four different
    climatic scenarios. The analysis is based on weather regimes and regional dummies.
  14: Econometric analysis is used to analyze the impact of production environment
    and regional dummies on TFP. Forecasts of TFP under different climate scenarios
    are presented.
More Notes:
  3: The study projects changes in TFP from increased climate variability and identifies
    socio-economic factors influencing agricultural productivity.
  11: The table also presents coefficients for variables such as Spending, Researcher,
    Literacy, Employment, Economic Openness, Income class dummy and geographic location.
  13: The analysis suggests that global agriculture has performed well in terms of
    technical efficiency and optimal scale, but lacks the ability to derive economies
    of scale by changing optimal input and output mixes.
  14: The paper highlights the failure of farmers to cope with environmental changes
    properly and the importance of agricultural spending for R&D.

    \ Change Index of 0.980, and a Mix-Efficiency Change Index of 0.944. A 1% increase\
    \ in crop diversity index will increase the likelihood of an increase in TFP,\
    \ technical-, scale-,and mix-ef\uFB01ciency by0.585%,0.031%, and0.074%, respectively."
