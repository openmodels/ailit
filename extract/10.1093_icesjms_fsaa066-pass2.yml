Drivers of Risk:
  4: Climate change impacts on fisheries (shifting stock ranges, productivity declines)
    and aquaculture (temperature, acidification, flooding, sea-level rise).
  9: Constraints and bottlenecks to aquaculture development (lack of sites, disease,
    restrictive regulations, poor public perception), failure to meet aquaculture
    growth targets
  13: Consumption minus combined (fisheries and aquaculture) production based on reported
    targets.
Highlights:
  4: Longer-term strategic adaptive planning for aquaculture, especially in consideration
    of climate change, appears nascent.
  9: ICES nations have a mounting domestic seafood production deficit. Unless aquaculture
    growth targets are met, ICES countries will likely become even more reliant on
    other large seafood producers, such as China
  13: Some ICES nations may face seafood deficits by 2050 based on current trends
    and production targets, as shown in Figure 5c.
Methodology:
  4: Assessed change in aquatic sources of 20 ICES nations by comparing trends of
    wild capture vs. aquaculture production; compiled government and industry documents
    on proposed growth targets for aquaculture production since 2013; modelled potential
    2050 aquaculture increases to that of possible total seafood consumption; highlighted
    top non-ICES seafood-trade partners and aquaculture production in those countries.
  9: "Applying each country\u2019s aquaculture growth trajectories out to the year\
    \ 2050 and modelling the potential growth over time, exponential model performed\
    \ best (R2adj = 0.97, Fstat = 2308, p-value < 0.001) in describing past (since\
    \ 1950) and potential future production"
More Notes:
  9: The analysis focuses on ICES nations and their seafood production and consumption.
    It assumes a linear relationship of total seafood consumption over time (R2adj
    = 0.95; Fstat = 978; p-value < 0.001)
  13: The analysis focuses on seafood production and consumption in ICES nations.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  4: Potential seafood deficits or surpluses in ICES nations up to 2050, related to
    aquaculture production and seafood consumption.
  9: Domestic seafood production deficit, reliance on imports
  13: Domestic seafood deficit in millions of tonnes over time.
Quantitative material:
  9: Projected 57% increase in total seafood consumption by 2050 (since 2013); Projected
    seafood deficit of about 7 million tonnes by 2050
  13: Figure 5c shows the domestic seafood deficit in millions of tonnes over time,
    with deficits indicated by negative orange values by 2050.
