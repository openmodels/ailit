Drivers of Risk:
  2: High temperatures detrimental to crop yields, water stress induced by high temperatures
  3: High temperatures, water stress, drought conditions
  4: High temperatures and water stress are key drivers leading to crop yield declines.
    Elevated CO2 cannot be confirmed as a safeguard of yields under high temperatures.
  5: High temperatures and changes in CO2 levels are major drivers of risk.
Highlights:
  2: "Crop models reproduce observed temperature responses of US maize, soybean, and\
    \ wheat yields; high temperatures negatively impact maize and soybean yields under\
    \ rainfed conditions; water stress is a key factor in yield decline; elevated\
    \ CO2 can only weakly reduce yield losses compared to irrigation; future yields\
    \ are modeled to decline for all three crops at temperatures >30\xB0C."
  3: High temperatures negatively impact maize, soybean, and wheat yields in the US.
  4: Current climate models can reliably assess large crop losses induced by a shift
    of temperatures from beneficial to detrimental in a narrow temperature range.
    Models suggest water stress as a major cause of yield declines.
  5: High temperatures have detrimental effects on rainfed maize and soybean crops.
    Elevated CO2 only limitedly attenuates yield loss.
Methodology:
  2: Ensemble of nine crop models used to reproduce observed average temperature responses
    of US maize, soybean, and wheat yields; comparison of simulated yields with observed
    yields; simulation of future yields under different temperature and CO2 levels.
  3: Statistical approach is used to analyze the effects of temperature on simulated
    yields from process-based models. Panel regression of US county data under rainfed
    conditions. Comparison of statistically estimated effects of temperatures on observed
    and simulated US yields in rainfed counties. Accounts for varying responses in
    terms of the phenological state of the crop, for interactions between atmospheric
    CO2 concentration, temperature, precipitation and other weather variables, and
    delayed effects of precipitation due to soil water storage. The analysis accounts
    for water availability by comparing predominantly rainfed or irrigated counties.
    Estimates are derived by a panel regression of US county data, where the considered
    crop is grown under predominantly (490%) rainfed conditions.
  4: Global Gridded Crop Models (GGCMs) are used to simulate crop yields under different
    temperatures and irrigation scenarios. Statistical models are used to estimate
    the changes in yield if the crop is exposed to temperatures within individual
    intervals for one day. Analysis is based on observed and simulated yields in the
    US. The results are applicable for current climate conditions and under Representative
    Concentration Pathway RCP8.5 (specifically crop model-specific default representations
    of present-day management conditions and fixed growing seasons).
  5: Panel regression is applied to simulated future yields in rainfed counties under
    climate change (RCP 8.5) using an ensemble of GGCMs. Statistical model to detect
    the temperature response of observed and simulated county yields in the US.
More Notes:
  2: The study focuses on US maize, soybean, and wheat yields.
  3: The study uses both statistical and process-based crop models to analyze the
    impact of high temperatures on crop yields. Statistical models are used to separate
    the effects of high temperatures on observed yields from other sources of variability.
  4: "The analysis focuses on maize, soybean, and wheat yields. The temperature threshold\
    \ for yield decline is roughly 30 /C176C (maize and soybean peak at the 24\u2013\
    27 /C176C interval). Full irrigation reduces the negative effect of temperatures\
    \ <30 /C176C."
  5: Irrigation can reduce the yield decline associated with high temperatures for
    all crops. The effect of temperature on wheat can be confounded by vernalization.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Agricultural productivity reductions due to high temperatures
  3: Impact on maize, soybean, and wheat yields in the US due to temperature changes.
  4: Crop yield losses are an outcome of interest, impacting agricultural productivity.
  5: Yields of maize, soybean and wheat, and changes to growing season length are
    impacted.
Quantitative material:
  2: "Each day >30\xB0C diminishes maize and soybean yields by up to 6% under rainfed\
    \ conditions."
  3: Yield coefficients for rainfed counties of Maize, Soybean and Wheat are presented,
    showing non-linear relationships between temperature and log yield.
  5: Average decline in growing season length with each additional degree of average
    growing season temperature over 1980-2010 is -7.4 days for rainfed maize, -5.6
    days for soybean, and -1.3 days for wheat.
