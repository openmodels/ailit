Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change impacts food security via availability, stability, utilization,
    and access, with availability being most studied via simulations. Climate variability
    is also a key driver of instability in access to food.
  2: Changes in land suitability and crop yields due to continued emissions of greenhouse
    gases.
  4: Climate change is likely to increase the number of people at risk of hunger,
    especially under certain socio-economic development paths.
  5: Socio-economic development paths (population growth, economic growth), climate
    change (mean changes, extreme events, sea-level rise), competition with bio-energy,
    and limitations in modeling the effects of CO2 fertilization.
  6: Climate change impacts all four dimensions of food security (availability, access,
    stability, utilization).
Highlights:
  1: Climate change is projected to significantly impact food security, potentially
    placing an additional 5 to 170 million people at risk of hunger by 2080. The impact
    depends heavily on socio-economic development scenarios.
  2: Areas potentially suitable for cropping will expand, the length of the growing
    period will increase, and crop yields may rise in temperate latitudes. A net decline
    of 110 million ha in total cropland is predicted in developing countries.
  4: Climate change is projected to increase the number of undernourished people,
    with an estimated rise of 5-26% by 2080 compared to no climate change scenarios,
    depending on socio-economic developments.
  5: Socio-economic development is a major driver of future food security, potentially
    outweighing the direct effects of climate change. Progress in reducing undernourishment
    will be unevenly distributed, with Sub-Saharan Africa remaining a major concern.
  6: The socioeconomic environment is more important than the biophysical changes
    of climate change for developing countries.
Methodology:
  1: 'The paper reviews simulation studies assessing the impact of climate change
    on global food security, focusing on the four dimensions of food security: availability,
    stability, access, and utilization. The FAO indicator of undernourishment is used,
    which covers availability and access.'
  2: Estimates of changes in land suitability, potential yields, and agricultural
    production are based on the FAO/International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
    (IIASA) agro-ecological zone (AEZ) methodology.
  4: The analysis uses two crop modeling systems, AEZ and DSSAT, coupled with an economic
    and food trade model (BLS), to project future scenarios of hunger risks in developing
    countries with and without climate change, including elevated CO2 effects.
  5: The IIASA system (AEZ model with GCM models and the IIASA BLS system) or its
    variants are commonly used for global assessments of climate change and food security,
    focusing on impacts on food availability and access. The time horizon extends
    to 2080.
  6: Quantitative assessments are reviewed, with consideration of biophysical changes
    and socioeconomic status.
More Notes:
  1: National self-sufficiency is neither necessary nor sufficient to guarantee food
    security at the individual level. Trade can alleviate food security issues if
    costs are low. The paper emphasizes the importance of considering all four dimensions
    of food security, not just availability, in assessing climate change impacts.
  2: The A1 SRES scenario corresponds to the highest emissions, and B1 corresponds
    to the lowest. The A2 SRES scenario assumes the highest projected population growth.
  4: No relevant information
  5: Assessments primarily focus on food availability and access, neglecting food
    safety and stability. The analyses exclude impacts of sea-level rise and marine/freshwater
    fish production. They also do not consider shifts in the frequency of extreme
    events.
  6: Climate change will increase the dependency of developing countries on imports
    and accentuate existing food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: The number of additional people at risk of hunger is projected to increase by
    5 million to 170 million by 2080.
  2: No relevant information
  4: No relevant information
  5: Prevalence of undernourishment and food security at the national or regional
    level.
  6: Climate change will adversely affect food security.
Quantitative material:
  1: A wide projected range (between 5 million and 170 million additional people at
    risk of hunger by 2080) depending on assumed socio-economic development is given.
  2: "Global mean surface temperature is projected to rise in a range from 1.8\xB0\
    C (with a range from 1.1\xB0C to 2.9\xB0C for SRES B1) to 4.0\xB0C (with a range\
    \ from 2.4\xB0C to 6.4\xB0C for A1) by 2100."
  4: The table shows projections of the number of people at risk of hunger in developing
    countries under various scenarios from 2020 to 2080, giving figures in millions
    for AEZ-BLS and DSSAT-BLS modeling systems.
  5: "Several studies estimate reductions of/H1102275% in undernourishment by 2080,\
    \ or /H11015560 million to 700 million people, projecting 100 million to 240 million\
    \ undernourished by 2080 (A1, B1, and B2) compared to FAO estimates of 820 million\
    \ today.  Scenario A 2 is an exception, with a slight decrease in hunger by 2080.\
    \ Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 40\u201350% of global hunger by 2080, or even\
    \ 70-75% in some simulations."
  6: All quantitative assessments reviewed show that climate change will adversely
    affect food security.
