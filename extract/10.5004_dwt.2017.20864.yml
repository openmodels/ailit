Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increasing water scarcity, increasing costs for infrastructure and service delivery,
    resource deterioration, increasing environmental and economic externalities, population
    growth and changing consumption patterns, low supply efficiencies, lower rates
    of water reuse and recycling, low energy efficiency in the water sector, and the
    impacts of climate change are identified as major challenges threatening water
    sector sustainability.
  3: Prolonged overdrafting of groundwater leads to a considerable decline in groundwater
    levels. Variation in precipitation causes major fluctuation in dam fill rates.
    Limitation of conventional freshwater resources.
  4: Depletion of groundwater levels and pollution by anthropogenic activities risk
    water supply degradation.
  5: Overpumping of groundwater for irrigation, economic policies encouraging unsustainable
    water use (subsidized prices, etc.), increasing municipal water demand, and expansion
    of the industrial base are identified as drivers of risk.
  6: High non-revenue water rates indicating inefficiencies in water supply systems.
  7: High per capita water consumption, non-existence of price-signaling mechanisms,
    high rates of subsidies, energy-intensive desalination technology, low efficiency
    of wastewater recovery, and mismatch between wastewater treatment levels and reuse.
  8: Limited surface water resources and continuous deterioration in irrigation water
    quality; Agricultural sector consumes up to 85% of total water supplies in some
    GCC countries, drawn mainly from groundwater; Overdrafting of groundwater resources
    and their degradation; Heavy mining of deep non-renewable aquifers; Low cost recovery
    of the wastewater sector due to the absence of an explicit wastewater tariff;
    Rapid expansion in septic tanks due to lagging wastewater services; High level
    of infiltration to the collection network by shallow waters results in increased
    salinity levels; significant volumes of industrial waste enter the wastewater
    collection system; lack of flow meters installed on groundwater wells
  9: Heavy reliance on traditional irrigation methods, such as flood irrigation, leading
    to low water use efficiency and high losses; dominance of high-water-consuming
    crops like fodder; reliance on desalination plants vulnerable to threats like
    pollution and power outages.
  13: Low irrigation efficiencies in agriculture due to traditional irrigation methods
    (flood irrigation); continuation of 2010/2012 trends in agricultural water use
    and current irrigation efficiency.
Highlights:
  1: The GCC Unified Water Strategy (2016-2035) aims to address challenges facing
    the sustainability of the water sector in GCC countries.
  3: GCC countries depend primarily on groundwater to meet their water requirements.
    Prolonged overdrafting of groundwater has resulted in considerable decline.
  4: GCC countries are implementing major desalination expansion projects to meet
    increasing water demands.
  5: Agricultural sector water consumption constitutes about 77% of the total water
    demands in GCC countries. Municipal water share is increasing with time. Industrial
    sector represents the least share in total water demands.
  6: Expansion of desalination is a major focus for addressing water demand but comes
    with significant financial and environmental costs.
  7: High subsidies and low cost recovery in the municipal water sector create a heavy
    financial burden on the fiscal budget. Energy-intensive desalination places a
    strain on the environment and threatens the income of GCC countries. Low wastewater
    recovery and reuse represent major opportunities lost.
  8: "Agriculture consumes up to 85% of the total water supplies in some of the GCC\
    \ countries, but does not contribute more than 2% of any GCC country\u2019s GDP"
  9: Industrial sector's rapidly increasing water consumption due to diversification
    policies, leading to potential competition over water resources with other sectors.
  13: Implementing GCC UWS strategy in the agricultural sector can save significant
    amounts of water, particularly from groundwater storage. Improving irrigation
    efficiency and increasing wastewater collection/treatment can lead to substantial
    savings and potential surplus in some countries.
Methodology:
  3: No relevant information
  13: Simulation of different scenarios related to water management in the GCC countries.
More Notes:
  3: The paper discusses water resources in the GCC countries, focusing on groundwater
    and surface water. Desalination and wastewater treatment are also mentioned. The
    information provided relates to water resource availability and usage patterns.
  5: Saudi Arabia made major review of its food self-sufficiency policy in 2000, phasing
    out wheat production and irrigation water conservation programs, leading to a
    decline in irrigated areas and groundwater abstraction. The paper indicates that
    the industrial water consumption figures reported are likely underestimates.
  7: Hydraulic loading of wastewater treatment systems can negatively impact the environment
    and the quality of treated wastewater.

  11: This page focuses on water management strategies in GCC countries and doesn't
    directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes related to climate change
    adaptation at a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: The paper discusses potential financial, economic, and environmental benefits
    from the implementation of the GCC Unified Water Strategy (UWS).
  3: No relevant information
  5: This paper identifies total water demand and sectoral water consumption (municipal,
    industrial, agricultural) as relevant outcomes.
  7: Significant financial and economic losses due to water production, transmission,
    distribution, and subsidies.
  8: "Agricultural sector does not contribute more than 2% of any GCC country\u2019\
    s GDP; Degradation of the quality of irrigation water gradually leads to reduction\
    \ in productivity and eventually loss of agricultural lands; Heavy mining of deep\
    \ non-renewable aquifers leads to increased pumping lift costs"
  13: Reduction in water supply requirements, financial and economic savings in municipal
    water supply and wastewater, desalination production, energy requirements, and
    emissions. Potential water savings in the agricultural sector.
Quantitative material:
  4: Desalination capacity in GCC countries is about 4.7 BCM, with expectations to
    double by 2016.
  5: Table 3 provides total water demand development in GCC countries from 1980-2010
    in MCM and associated growth rates. Table 4 provides water consumption by sector
    in GCC countries in 2010 in MCM and percentages.
  7: Cost of water production, transmission, distribution, and subsidies ranging from
    20% to 40% in the GCC countries. Desalination consumes about 55% of the total
    energy used in Kuwait and 30% in Bahrain. Average daily water consumption ranges
    between 238 and 590 liters per capita. Wastewater collection does not exceed 50%
    of domestic water volumes. Reuse rates are less than 40% of treated wastewater
    volumes.
  8: Table 6 shows treated wastewater and reuse in the GCC countries for 2010 (municipal
    water consumption, collected wastewater, treated wastewater, reused treated wastewater,
    % of collected to municipal, % of treated of collected, % of reused to treated).
    Table 7 shows trends in agricultural water consumption in the GCC countries from
    1990-2010, in MCM.
  13: Municipal water supply requirements reduced from 11 BCM in 2035 (BAU) to 7.3
    BCM in 2035 with management intervention; Agricultural water requirements decrease
    from 20 BCM in 2015 to about 16.8 BCM in 2035 with GCC UWS strategy; Cumulative
    savings for all GCC countries in agricultural water requirements would be about
    29 BCM for 2016-2035 (Bahrain = 1,021 MCM; Kuwait = 2,924 MCM; Oman = 1,324 MCM;
    Qatar = 623 MCM; Saudi Arabia = 20,516 MCM; and UAE = 2,689 MCM).
