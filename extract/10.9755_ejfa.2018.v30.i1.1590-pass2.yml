Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climatic uncertainty.
  6: Technological changes required for the costs of sustainable fishery practices,
    such as support for artificial habitats, conservation zones, and soft measures
    (information databases for regulation enforcement).
  7: Changes in natural resource endowment (e.g., due to climate change impacts).
  8: Increased supply and efficiency of natural resource endowment, particularly in
    fisheries.
  9: Technological changes suggested from research to enhance sustainable practices
    in the fisheries sector of the UAE.
  10: Climate change, specifically its impact on the UAE fisheries sector.
  12: Scenario 1 and Scenario 2, presumably representing different climate change
    scenarios.
Highlights:
  1: Prices of fishery products and related commodities will decline, benefiting consumers;
    Producers in relevant sectors gain due to more sales, offsetting losses from lower
    fish prices; Returns to factors of production change.
  7: Increasing the natural resource endowment of fisheries in the UAE is important
    for increasing fish production.
  8: Sustainable practices increase overall efficiency, benefiting the consumer with
    lower food prices and increasing production output.
  9: The technological changes enhance the economic situation of both consumers and
    producers of fish in the UAE, with consumers able to consume more fish at lower
    prices. The overall impact on the UAE's food sector is positive despite declining
    fish prices for producers.
  10: Adaptation to proposed sustainable practices in the UAE fisheries sector in
    response to climate change leads to increased fish production and household consumption.
  12: Fishing sector sees the largest impact, with a substantial decrease in imports
    (-6.64% to -11.75%) and a large increase in exports (13.48% to 25.77%) under both
    scenarios. Raw milk and red meat production also see notable export increases.
Methodology:
  1: Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model using UAE economic data to simulate
    the economic impacts of sustainable practices (hard and soft measures) in the
    fisheries sector, assuming targeted shifts based on adaptation measures; Applicable
    when evaluating the economic impacts of sustainable fisheries practices in the
    UAE under climate change.
  6: Simulates various options of technological change in the UAE fisheries sector
    by shifting from capital and labor to natural resources.
  7: Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, specifically GTAP 4, used to simulate
    the impact of changes in natural resource endowment on fisheries production. Scenarios
    are based on varying elasticities of supply (0.29 and 0.525), reflecting different
    fisheries management regimes (open access vs. private management).
  8: Analysis conducted using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model.
  9: The paper evaluates the economic options of sustainable practices in the fisheries
    sector in the UAE, capturing forward and backward linkages. The analysis is based
    on two scenarios.
  10: Economic modeling exercise using two scenarios that increase capital endowment
    to the fisheries sector by 15% (Scenario 1) and 30% (Scenario 2) from the 2012
    baseline, with additional increases of capital investment by 15% and labor availability
    by 5% in Scenario 2. Applicable to future sustainability conditions.
More Notes:
  1: The authors note a limitation that fishermen, as profit maximizers, may underinvest
    in sustainable adaptations, suggesting a role for government intervention.
  9: The base year for the analysis is 2012. The value of fish exports was very small
    in 2012 ($31,000), while the base value of fish imports was $47.5 million.
  10: Study acknowledges that fishermen are profit maximizers and underinvest in adaptation,
    necessitating government intervention.
  12: The table provides a detailed breakdown of how different commodity trade values
    are expected to change under different climate scenarios. CIF and FOB are defined.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Changes in consumer and producer welfare due to simulated interventions; Prices
    of fishery products and related commodities; Returns to factors of production
    (capital, labor); Sales in directly and indirectly related economic sectors.
  7: Changes in production quantities of fish in the UAE.
  9: Changes in household demand for commodities, merchandise trade (exports and imports),
    and prices paid by firms to production factors.
  10: Increase in fish production, changes in prices of production factors, changes
    in household consumption of domestically-produced fish.
  12: Changes in trade values of commodities (% change from baseline) for both merchandise
    imports (CIF) and exports (FOB).
Outcomes of Interest:
  8: Sustainable fishing practices result in lower fish prices, higher demand and
    production in other food sectors in the UAE, and slight price increases in land
    and labor.
Quantitative material:
  1: Prices of fishery products and of other related commodities will decline.
  7: 'Scenario 1: 15% increase in natural resource endowment leads to a 7.8% increase
    in fish production from a baseline of 72,700 tons in 2012. Scenario 2: 30% increase
    in natural resource endowment, 15% capital, and 5% labor leads to a 15.1% increase
    in fish production from the baseline.'
  8: Fish prices decrease by 7.7% to 13.68%; land prices increase by 0.016% to 0.03%;
    labor prices change minimally.
  9: 'Scenario 1: Household consumption of domestically-produced fish increases by
    9.12%, imported fish declines by 4.43%, fish exports increase by 13.48%, fishery
    imports decline by 6.64%, composite fish demand increases by 5.62%, price of natural
    resources declines by 38.7%, price of land increases by 1.1%. Scenario 2: Household
    consumption of domestically-produced fish increases by 17.31%, imported fish declines
    by 7.99%, fish exports increase by 25.77%, fishery imports decline by 11.75%,
    composite fish demand increases by 10.57%, price of natural resources declines
    by 62.2%, price of land increases by 1.2%.'
  10: 'Scenario 1: Fish production increases by 7.8% (to 78,400 tons). Scenario 2:
    Fish production increases by 15.1% (to 83,700 tons). Household consumption increases
    by 9.12% in Scenario 1 and 17.31% in Scenario 2 from baseline.'
  12: Provides percentage changes in trade values for various commodities under two
    scenarios.
