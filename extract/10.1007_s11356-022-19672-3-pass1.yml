Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature shocks (heat waves, low rainfall), Climate change
  2: Increasing global temperatures, temperature variations, and reliance on agriculture.
  5: Temperature shocks, fuel poverty.
  6: Temperature shock
  7: Temperature shocks (variations of more than 2 standard deviations from the long-term
    average)
  8: Temperature shocks (defined as deviations from long-term mean temperature). Number
    of hot days (days 2 standard deviations above long-run mean). Temperature Deviation.
  10: Temperature shock, low rainfall leading to higher evaporation and increased
    irrigation costs, impact on worker productivity
  11: Temperature shocks.
Highlights:
  1: Temperature shocks increase energy poverty in Vietnam; Reduced agricultural output
    and labor productivity due to temperature shocks contribute to energy poverty.
  2: "Short-term temperature variations have a significant impact on energy poverty;\
    \ impacts differ by region, with agricultural production in Vietnam\u2019s north\
    \ particularly vulnerable."
  5: The paper investigates the relationship between fuel poverty and temperature
    shocks in Vietnam districts.
  6: Temperature shocks are found to significantly increase energy poverty in Vietnam,
    as measured by several metrics including the Multidimensional Energy Poverty Index
    (MEPI).
  7: Temperature shocks increase the likelihood of multidimensional fuel poverty and
    the intensity of fuel poverty.
  8: Rising temperatures in northern and central coastal areas considerably enhanced
    multidimensional energy poverty. Thermal shock 2 years ago altered MEPI status
    and score, but the effect was small and not observed 3 years ago.
  10: Temperature shocks have a statistically significant positive impact on MEPI
    status in most specifications. Total earnings, earning per capita, and agricultural
    output have statistically significant negative impacts on MEPI status and score.
    The impact of temperature shock on MEPI score is less robust.
  11: "Higher temperatures contribute to multidimensional energy poverty in Vietnam.\
    \ Temperature shocks cause families to sacrifice greener energy sources or advanced\
    \ energy equipment. The impacts are concentrated in Vietnam\u2019s northern and\
    \ central coastal areas and are greater for rural families."
Methodology:
  1: Econometric estimation of the impact of temperature shocks on energy poverty,
    mediating the role of financial development and environmental considerations in
    Vietnam.
  2: Linear prediction framework using the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey
    (VHLSS) data, exploiting random variance of temperature waves over place and time.
  5: Regression analysis using panel data from 2010-2016 to assess the impact of temperature
    shocks on energy poverty in Vietnam, controlling for household and district factors,
    time trends, and provincial fixed effects. MEPI (Multidimensional Energy Poverty
    Index) is used as a key metric.
  6: Regression analysis using household survey data (VHLSS) with controls for province
    and year fixed effects, province-specific linear time trends, and survey time
    fixed effects. Panel data analysis across different geographic regions (North,
    Central Coast, Central Highlands, South) is also performed.
  7: Econometric analysis using temperature variations to assess the effect on energy
    poverty, including logarithmic regression of agricultural productivity based on
    humidity and temperature.
  8: Regression analysis using panel data for Vietnam's four regions. Results are
    applicable to the specific context of Vietnam.
  10: Regression analysis using MEPI status and scoring variables as mediators. Fixed
    effects are included for province, year, survey time, and a province*linear time
    trend.
  11: The study uses panel-based survey statistics and climate data for Vietnam. It
    employs regression analysis with controls, fixed effects, and time trends. The
    results are applicable to Vietnam and potentially other Southeast Asian countries.
More Notes:
  1: The study suggests that underreporting of income, especially in agriculture,
    might mask the true mitigating effect of overall income on energy poverty.
  2: The study focuses on the consequence of fuel poverty as the outcome of interest.
  5: "The study uses ERA5 reanalysis data for meteorological parameters with a resolution\
    \ of 31 km and latitude/longitude of 0.25-0.25\xB0 and hourly temporal resolution."
  6: The analysis focuses on the impact of temperature shocks on energy poverty, which
    is a specific aspect of the broader economic impacts of climate change. The paper
    uses the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey (VHLSS) dataset. The MEPI is
    calculated based on indicators related to cooking fuel, electricity usage, and
    ownership of durable consumer goods.
  7: The study considers the implicit adaptation response by evaluating temperature
    variations based on long-term averages. Region-specific temperature shocks are
    created to account for varying baseline temperatures across Vietnam.
  8: The effect of temperature shocks on multidimensional energy poverty is found
    to be statistically significant.
  10: The paper investigates the mechanism whereby thermal shock causes multidimensional
    energy poverty through reduced agricultural productivity and household income.
  11: The paper suggests tailored policy interventions are needed, particularly in
    the most vulnerable regions, and recommends reducing the cost of power for impoverished
    households to reduce multidimensional energy poverty.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Agricultural output (reduced by temperature shocks), Labor productivity (affected
    by rising temperatures)
  2: Fuel insecurity (energy poverty) in Vietnamese households.
  5: Energy poverty experienced by households.
  6: Energy poverty, measured by 10% measure, low earning-high cost measure, electricity
    measure, MEPI status, and MEPI 3.marks.
  7: Agricultural productivity loss
  8: Multidimensional Energy Poverty (MEPI) status and score.
  10: Multidimensional Energy Poverty (MEPI) status and score
  11: The paper investigates the impact of temperature shocks on multidimensional
    energy poverty (MEPI status and score) in Vietnam.
Quantitative material:
  1: Temperature shocks have a positive and quantitative impact on energy poverty.
  2: Vietnam's total energy poverty rate is 19%, with an MEPI rating and MEPI score
    of 0.188.
  5: The average proportion of energy-efficient dwellings in the sample is 19.5% according
    to the MEPI technique. Between 2010 and 2016, males accounted for 75% of household
    heads, with an average age of 50. The average household consists of four individuals,
    and the reinforced concrete roof covers nearly half of the house.
  6: Table 1 reports coefficients and standard errors for the effect of temperature
    shocks on various measures of energy poverty. For example, a temperature shock
    has a statistically significant (p<0.05) positive effect on MEPI status (0.025)
    and MEPI 3.marks (0.012). Table 2 reports coefficients, standard errors, and R-squared
    values for the effect of temperature shocks on MEPI status and score, disaggregated
    by geographic area.
  7: A 2.5% upsurge in the likelihood of being multidimensional fuel-poor is linked
    to a temperature shock. It is also linked to a 1.2% upsurge in the intensity of
    fuel poverty.
  8: Temperature shock increases MEPI status by 0.074*** and MEPI score by 0.056***
    (Cutoff=2.5 SD). Number of hot days increases MEPI status and score by 0.001***.
    Temperature deviation increases MEPI status by 0.030*** and MEPI score by 0.020**
  10: Table 7 presents regression results with MEPI status and MEPI score as dependent
    variables. Temperature shock coefficients, coefficients for total earnings, earning
    per capita, and agricultural output are reported. R-squared values are provided
    for each regression.
  11: Table 8 presents regression results showing the lagged impact of temperature
    shocks on MEPI status and score, with coefficients and significance levels. For
    example, a temperature shock lagged by 2 years has a statistically significant
    positive impact on both MEPI status (0.015*, p<0.1) and MEPI score (0.010**, p<0.05).
