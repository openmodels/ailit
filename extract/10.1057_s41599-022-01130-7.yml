Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change exposure and sensitivity, emission levels, economic, social, and
    governance adaptation readiness
  9: Anthropogenic GHG emissions; Level of economic, governance, and social readiness;
    Income level
  12: Climate change vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity), low climate readiness
    (social, governance, economic), extreme weather events (hurricanes, storms, wildfires,
    droughts), anthropogenic GHG emissions, habitat loss, income inequality.
  13: Rising levels of GHG emissions, income growth, climate change variabilities
    such as heatwaves, droughts, floods, and rising sea levels.
  14: Periodic GHG emissions, climate change effects altering rainfall patterns, decline
    in groundwater recharge and surface runoff.
Highlights:
  1: High-income economies with high social, governance, and economic readiness have
    low climate vulnerability, whereas developing economies with low income have high
    climate change exposure and sensitivity.
  9: Improvements in economic, governance, and social readiness minimize climate change
    exposure. Higher social readiness has a relatively high mitigation effect across
    sectors. Rising income level mitigates sectoral climate vulnerability. Climate
    reduction effect of readiness and income is high on health services compared to
    water services (health > food > habitat > ecosystem services > infrastructure
    > water).
  12: There is a negative relationship between climate change readiness and climate
    change vulnerability. Countries with high readiness tend to have low vulnerability.
    High governance readiness coupled with high social and economic climate readiness
    declines climate change vulnerability. Low climate readiness in developing countries
    increases their climate change vulnerability.
  13: The effect of economic, governance, and social readiness in reducing exposure
    and sensitivity to climate change; income growth reduces food sector vulnerability.
  14: Stocks of periodic GHG emissions spur sectoral climate change vulnerability
    across countries, with much impact on developing countries. Outgrowth in income
    level and adaptation readiness decline investment cost by reducing long-term environmental
    damage.
Methodology:
  1: "Romano\u2013Wolf technique to test multiple hypotheses and present the spatial\u2013\
    temporal severity of climate vulnerability and readiness to combat climate change."
  9: Empirical assessment using a linear relationship between income and climate change
    vulnerability across 192 countries and territories. Analysis considers income
    convergence and regional convergence.
  12: The paper analyzes the relationship between climate change readiness (social,
    governance, and economic) and climate change vulnerability across different countries
    and regions. The results are applicable to sampled economies based on average
    annual frequency.
  14: "Cross-section dependence test and Romano\u2013Wolf estimation technique to\
    \ assess heterogeneity across 192 countries. Business-as-usual scenarios examining\
    \ historical effects of anthropogenic GHG emissions."
More Notes:
  1: The study examines the long-term impact of climate change readiness and income
    expansion on sectoral-climate vulnerabilities.
  9: The study identifies specific countries with high and low climate vulnerability
    based on income level. Includes country-specific analyses (Figs. 7-11) examining
    the nexus between GHG emissions and income. Strong relationship between domestic
    capacity to lessen climate-related sensitivity in the health sector and sustainable
    economic readiness.
  12: The paper suggests that high income does not protect against extreme weather
    events, and that income convergence reduces climate change vulnerability in climate-exposed
    regions with high poverty rates.
  13: Climate change impacts are exacerbated by anthropogenic GHG emissions, and rising
    income levels can mitigate vulnerability across sectors.
  14: Climate change adaptation requires strong cooperation at regional and international
    levels.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Sectoral climate vulnerabilities (ecosystem services, food, health, human habitat,
    infrastructure, and water)
  9: Sectoral climate vulnerability (ecosystem services, food, habitat, health, infrastructure,
    water); Income level
  12: No relevant information
  13: The impacts of climate change on the vulnerability of the food sector, health
    sector, and infrastructure; potential effects on food prices and social stability.
  14: Sectoral climate vulnerabilities across 192 global economies, impact of climate
    change readiness and income expansion on sectoral vulnerabilities.
Quantitative material:
  1: No specific quantitative results are present on this page.
  9: Ecosystem services vulnerability declines by 0.28-1.48% due to improvements in
    economic, governance, and social water readiness. Sectoral climate vulnerability
    mitigated by 0.02-0.15% due to rise in income level. Parameter estimates are provided
    in Table 1, including standard errors and significance levels for various relationships.

    readiness (score 0-1) and climate change vulnerability (score 0-1) across various
    countries and regions.
