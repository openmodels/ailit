Drivers of Risk:
  1: Extreme temperatures due to climate change
  2: Environmental heat exposure.
  3: Daily maximum temperature (T max), hourly wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT)
  4: Rising Wet Bulb Globe Temperatures increase labor productivity loss.
  6: Climate change, specifically rising temperatures and different Representative
    Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP8.5).
  7: Heat due to climate change.
  8: Heat events exacerbated by climate change (high-greenhouse-gas emissions pathway
    RCP8.5).
  10: Climate change, heat
Highlights:
  1: Economic costs from labour productivity losses due to heat are approximately
    CHF 665 million per year and could triple under RCP8.5 by the end of the century.
  2: Provides a detailed impact assessment and future projections for excess mortality
    and losses in labour productivity in Switzerland at the kilometre level for distinct
    population groups and activity classes using a common modelling framework.
  3: Shows the relationship between daily maximum temperature and relative risk of
    daily mortality for people at or above the age of 75, with relative risks increasing
    sharply as temperature rises.
  6: Labor productivity losses in Switzerland are projected to increase significantly
    under the RCP8.5 scenario, particularly in southern cantons and areas at higher
    altitudes. The high physical activity sector experiences a disproportionately
    higher percentage of losses compared to their share of the workforce. Uncertainty
    in estimates is considerable.
  7: Heat-related deaths and economic costs (labor productivity losses) are comparable
    to or even higher than those caused by the flu in Switzerland today.
  8: The monetary costs of heat and mortality are already substantial today, and these
    impacts may double (mortality) or triple (labour productivity) by the end of the
    century under a high-emissions scenario. Identifies regions particularly affected
    by heat.
  10: Projected Impact of Heat on Mortality and Labour Productivity under Climate
    Change in Switzerland
Methodology:
  1: High-resolution spatial analysis, risk framework of the IPCC (hazard, exposure,
    and vulnerability), Monte Carlo simulation, considering that no socio-economic
    changes take place.
  2: Uses the IPCC risk framework as implemented in the open-source CLIMADA impact
    modelling platform, combining hazard, exposure, and vulnerability to quantify
    socio-economic impacts of natural hazards; combines high-resolution datasets,
    namely (i) the CH2018 Climate Scenarios, and (ii) the geographical distribution
    of population and workers per hectare; uses impact functions to represent the
    link between local exposure and heat hazards; combines the three risk components
    using a Monte Carlo simulation to assess the uncertainties.
  3: Uses CH2018 climate scenarios for Switzerland, population data from the Swiss
    Federal Statistical Office, and impact functions linking maximum temperature to
    excess mortality from Ragettli et al. (2017). Calculates fraction of deaths attributable
    to heat (AF) using equation (1). Computes impact of heat on labor productivity
    using hourly wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT).
  4: The analysis uses Monte Carlo simulation with hourly WBGT predictions from climate
    data (CH2018), linking these to labor productivity loss using impact functions.
  6: Monte Carlo simulation to calculate labor productivity losses under different
    RCP scenarios; spatially explicit analysis at the cantonal level.
  7: The model considers heat days occurring in the spring.
  8: Uses the IPCC risk framework to model the impacts of heat on mortality and labour
    productivity in Switzerland, using a spatially explicit framework and Monte Carlo
    simulation to quantify uncertainties, keeping socio-economic factors constant.

More Notes:
  1: The study also models heat-related mortality but this is not a macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal outcome.
  2: The study models heat-related impacts in Switzerland throughout the century.
    The study is the first to combine mortality and labour productivity impacts in
    the same model.
  3: Assumes deaths are evenly distributed throughout the warm season (May to September)
    and the same on each day. Assumes the relative risk of mortality is the same for
    all regions of Switzerland.
  6: Low physical activity workers represent 67% of the total exposed value and experience
    45-50% of the losses. High physical activity workers represent only 10% of workers
    but account for 22-29% of the losses. The relative increases in impact between
    the baseline and 2050 are much more apparent under the RCP8.5 scenario than RCP2.6.
  7: The model does not account for the urban heat island effect, demographic changes,
    or potential future adaptations of society to a warmer climate.
  8: Model could be used to analyze adaptation measures and their effectiveness. Code
    and data are openly available.
  10: The paper appears to focus on Switzerland.

  10: Mortality and labour productivity
Quantitative material:
  1: Economic costs caused by losses in labour productivity amount to around CHF 665
    million (approx. USD 700 million) per year in Switzerland; could triple by the
    end of the century under RCP8.5.
  2: In the summer of 2015, the second warmest summer in Switzerland on record, an
    increase in mortality of 5.4% was reported, with people older than 75 making up
    77% of the deaths.
  3: "Equation (1): AF(T)=RR(T)\u22121/RR(T), where RR(T) represents the RR of daily\
    \ mortality for the respective temperature. Equation (2): IMortality = cells\u2211\
    \ T\u2211 N deaths,cellAF(T)N days,cell(T)"
  4: The analysis quantifies labor productivity loss based on WBGT values.
  6: Baseline (2020, RCP8.5) labor productivity loss is CHF 665 million per year.
    In 2050, labor productivity loss increases by 8% under RCP2.6 and 65% under RCP8.5,
    reaching CHF 1.1 billion per year.  This corresponds to 0.24% of total yearly
    exposed salary value (0.21% for low physical activity, 0.54% for high physical
    activity).  Under RCP8.5 in 2050 the 95th percentile is CHF4 billion per year.
  7: In 2080, the difference in heat impacts under an RCP8.5 scenario versus the RCP2.6
    scenario is 823 (+117%) additional heat-related deaths per year and an increase
    of CHF 1381 million (+170%) for labour productivity losses.
  8: Monetary costs of heat and mortality impacts may double, and labour productivity
    loss may triple by the end of the century under RCP8.5.
