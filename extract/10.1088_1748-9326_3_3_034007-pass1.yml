Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (temperature and precipitation changes), uncertainty in crop responses
    to temperature and precipitation
  5: "Temperature changes (\u03B2T, \u03941T) and precipitation changes (\u03B2P,\
    \ \u03941P) are the main climate change drivers impacting crop yields."
  6: Temperature and rainfall sensitivity of crops, uncertainty in global climate
    sensitivity to CO2, regional temperature change.
  7: Uncertainties in average growing season temperature and precipitation changes;
    Uncertainties in crop responses to temperature; Impacts of extreme events, pests,
    diseases, changes in solar radiation, and other factors
Highlights:
  1: Uncertainties related to temperature represented a greater contribution to climate
    change impact uncertainty than those related to precipitation for most crops and
    regions; The sensitivity of crop yields to temperature was a critical source of
    uncertainty; Progress in understanding crop responses to temperature and the magnitude
    of regional temperature changes are two of the most important needs for climate
    change impact assessments and adaptation efforts for agriculture.
  5: "Temperature terms generally contribute most of the total uncertainty, but precipitation\
    \ uncertainties become most important for high values of E[\u03B2P] coupled with\
    \ low values of E[\u03B2T] and Var(\u03B2T) and high values of Var(\u03941P).\
    \ Relative importance of climate change impacts rests largely on impacts of rainfall\
    \ changes."
  6: Temperature-related uncertainties drive most of the overall impact uncertainty
    for crop production. Reducing uncertainty in temperature sensitivities of crops
    would substantially improve our ability to predict agricultural responses to climate
    change.
  7: Uncertainties in average growing season temperature changes and crop responses
    to these changes represent a greater source of uncertainty for future impacts
    than changes in precipitation, but reduced rainfall projection uncertainties would
    be useful for some crops.
Methodology:
  1: Evaluation of uncertainties for projections of climate change impacts on crop
    production focusing on the relative contributions of climate model projections
    of future temperature and precipitation, and the sensitivities of crops to temperature
    and precipitation changes; Sensitivity analysis
  5: "The analysis uses equation (2) to model crop yield sensitivity to temperature\
    \ and precipitation. Sensitivity analysis is performed by varying \u03B2P and\
    \ one other variable at a time, while keeping other variables fixed at their median\
    \ values. This analyzes the fraction of total variance in the model contributed\
    \ by temperature terms."
  6: "The study used 10,000 random combinations of eight variables in equation (2),\
    \ with distributions defined in figure 3, to compute the fraction of total variance\
    \ arising from temperature. The results in figure 1(b) were re-generated after\
    \ inflating the estimates of E[\u03B2P] in each crop\u2013region combination by\
    \ a factor of two and five to test the sensitivity of results to rainfall estimates."
  7: Analysis relies on time series models rather than process-based models or cross-sectional
    data. Considers uncertainties related to growing season average temperature and
    precipitation.
More Notes:
  1: The study aims to identify and prioritize factors contributing to uncertainty
    in climate change impact assessments in agriculture to better inform research
    efforts.
  5: The results are intuitive in the sense that crops relatively sensitive to rainfall
    and where future rainfall is very uncertain will drive future impacts.
  6: 'The paper discusses two general approaches for estimating crop temperature sensitivity:
    detailed studies of processes through field and laboratory experiments, and statistical
    analyses of past temperature and crop production variations. The former requires
    models to extrapolate results to broad scales, while the latter is hampered by
    variations in other yield-controlling factors, the quality and spatial scale of
    available data, and by a relatively small number of observations.'
  7: The study does not consider adaptive management changes or the distribution of
    rainfall within growing seasons. Crop model inter-comparison projects may be useful
    to assess crop model uncertainty.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Crop production, crop yields, food production
  5: Crop yields, implicitly influencing agricultural productivity and potentially
    GDP through agricultural output.
  6: Crop production variations in response to climate change.
  7: Crop yields and agricultural responses to climate change
Quantitative material:
  1: Analysis of 94 crop-region combinations representing the bulk of calories consumed
    by malnourished populations.
  5: "Estimates for each variable in equation (2) from 94 crop-region combinations\
    \ are presented as % per \xB0C for \u03B2T, % per % for \u03B2P, \xB0C for \u0394\
    1T, and % for \u03941P. The sensitivity analysis displays the fraction of total\
    \ variance contributed by the first three temperature terms."
  6: "Temperature terms contributed more than half of total variance in 92% of cases\
    \ and more than three-fourths in 81% of cases. If the importance of rainfall to\
    \ crops is roughly five times as large relative to temperature as estimated, terms\
    \ related to rainfall could contribute more than half of total uncertainties for\
    \ most crops. Lowest uncertainty for temperature sensitivity (\u03B2T) was found\
    \ for South Asia wheat, with \u03C3(\u03B2T) = 0.7% per \xB0C. Applying this value\
    \ to all other crops resulted in a reduction of total variance of impact projections\
    \ by over half in most cases."
