Drivers of Risk:
  1: Tropical cyclones (TCs) and their impacts on economic growth.
  2: Tropical cyclones are the primary shocks impacting economic growth outcomes.
  3: Future greenhouse gas emissions, socioeconomic development, normative assumptions
    on discounting, historical growth response of countries to TCs, response of TC
    impacts to future greenhouse gas emissions, and response of temperature to a greenhouse
    gas emission pulse.
  4: The paper discusses the frequency and intensity of TCs and their socioeconomic
    impacts, particularly on GDP growth.
  5: Tropical cyclones (TCs)
  6: Tropical cyclones are identified as a driver of economic growth losses.
  7: Tropical cyclones (TCs)
  8: Tropical cyclones (TCs), floods, and droughts are identified as drivers impacting
    the outcomes, along with rising sea levels and increased TC rainfall under global
    warming.
  9: The drivers of risk are the frequency and intensity of landfalling tropical cyclones,
    global mean temperature (GMT), and population exposure.
  10: The drivers of risk are changes in global mean temperature (GMT), probabilistic
    TC time series, and socio-economic pathways (SSPs).
  11: The analysis considers temperature-dependent damage functions, both for aggregate
    temperature effects and specifically for tropical cyclones. It uses historical
    and projected data for GDP, population, temperature, and TC exposure. Future TC
    exposure data is probabilistic, based on TC track simulations.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Economic development and the social cost of carbon (SCC).
  2: The paper provides an overview of evaluating economic damages caused by tropical
    cyclones (TCs) using metrics such as discounted annual damage (DAD) and contribution
    to the social cost of carbon (SCC).
  3: Tropical cyclone (TC) damages, including damage as a percentage of GDP (DAD)
    and TC-induced Social Cost of Carbon (SCC).
  4: The paper evaluates the impacts of tropical cyclones (TCs) on national GDP pathways
    and economic growth by assessing deviations due to climate change.
  5: Discounted annual damage (DAD) from tropical cyclone impacts, both global and
    per-capita.
  6: The paper evaluates the damages from tropical cyclone-induced economic growth
    losses and their sensitivity to global mean temperature changes.
  7: Social cost of carbon (SCC) is evaluated with and without tropical cyclone (TC)
    effects.
  9: This paper evaluates the impact of tropical cyclones (TCs) on national per capita
    GDP (GDPpc) growth. It also estimates the social cost of carbon (SCC).
  10: This paper evaluates the economic damages (changes to national GDPpc growth
    rates) induced by tropical cyclones (TCs) under different climate change scenarios.
    It also evaluates the social cost of carbon from tropical cyclones.
  11: This paper calculates the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), both with and without
    the explicit contribution of tropical cyclones (TCs). It analyzes damage estimates
    to calculate the global SCC.
Highlights:
  1: Benefits of climate policies could be substantially underestimated if TC damages
    are not adequately accounted for.
  2: The outcomes show that accounting for TCs does not impact the combined estimate
    of temperature and TC impacts on growth when calculated in a single regression
    framework.
  3: TC impacts are an additional impact channel not captured by population-weighted
    temperature over land alone. Cumulative growth losses increase with the number
    of lag years considered. The heterogeneous exposure of countries to TCs leads
    to substantially different induced growth losses.
  4: Growth losses due to TCs do not depend significantly on a country's economic
    development level but rather on country-specific characteristics. Moreover, high-income
    countries also see negative impacts despite historical adaptations.
  5: Estimates the absolute TC-induced SCC (TC-SCC) and the relative increase in SCC
    due to TCs. Finds a median global SCC of US$/tCO2 173 (2005 constant US$) for
    their main specification and without TC impacts.
  6: Tropical cyclones significantly increase the social cost of carbon, especially
    under the strongest emission scenario RCP8.5.
  7: Tropical cyclones increase the social cost of carbon. Lower- and middle-income
    countries face larger relative adaptation challenges due to TC impacts. DAD analysis
    reveals that differences in income among countries must not be neglected when
    estimating adaptation challenges. In per-capita terms, absolute DADs are highest
    for strongly exposed high-income countries. When DAD is measured relative to average
    household income, the damages for strongly exposed, upper-middle-income island
    states and lower-middle-income countries become comparable to those of the USA.
  8: TC damages are substantial and drive up SCC estimates significantly for major
    emitters like China, USA, and India.
  9: The study estimates the average growth response across all countries to both
    temperature and the national shares of people exposed to strong TC winds.
  10: The relationship between exogenous and endogenous variables cannot be explained
    by RCP-independent coefficients, therefore the structural dependence on RCPs is
    accounted for.
Methodology:
  1: Derives temperature-dependent damage functions for 41 TC-affected countries to
    quantify the country-level SCC induced by the persistent growth effects of damaging
    TCs.
  2: The analysis uses a modeling framework based on empirical estimates of economic
    growth responses to TC strikes, applying a three-way fixed effects panel model
    with national shares of people exposed to TCs and temperature impacts controlled
    in parallel.
  3: 'Uses scenario analysis and probabilistic methods (bootstrapping, TC impact emulator)
    to project TC damages from 2010-2100. Incorporates six uncertainty dimensions:
    future greenhouse gas emissions, socioeconomic development, discounting, historical
    growth response, TC impact response to emissions, and temperature response to
    emissions.  Bootstrapping preserves spatio-temporal correlation patterns.'
  4: The analysis employs discounted difference of GDP trajectories using scenario-based
    models to derive temperature-dependent damage functions from historical TC impacts,
    and applies mixed-effects regression to account for dependencies.
  5: "Quantifies uncertainties in DAD using different uncertainty dimensions (UDs)\
    \ for the main specification (RCP6.0-SSP2, and Ricke\u2019s discounting choice).\
    \ Uses a statistical relationship between per-capita GDP growth and population-weighted\
    \ annual mean temperatures over land to estimate the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)\
    \ with and without TC impacts."
  6: Uses a mixed-effects model to examine the relationship between global temperature
    changes and cyclone-induced economic losses, utilizing multiple realizations across
    RCP scenarios.
  7: The analysis uses a damage assessment (DAD) approach and considers income differences
    among countries. The analysis uses 7,200,000 realizations per country. The analysis
    applies to the period 2010-2100.
  8: The study uses temperature-dependent-damage functions and empirical modeling
    to account for the persistence of TC damages in economic systems.
  9: "The paper uses a three-way fixed effects panel model to estimate national GDPpc\
    \ growth responses over the period 1981\u20132015. It employs the impact assessment\
    \ tool CLIMADA to generate wind footprints for TC tracks. It uses historical and\
    \ projected population data (HYDEv3.2.1 for historical, extended for future SSPs).\
    \ The analysis includes bias-correcting temperature series. The SCC is also estimated\
    \ using GCMs and RCPs. The paper implements a bootstrapping strategy to account\
    \ for uncertainties related to the economic growth regression. A maximum entropy\
    \ method is used to construct 1200 bootstraps respecting the dependence structure\
    \ of the original panel data."
  10: The analysis uses a mixed-effects model to derive temperature-dependent damage
    functions by regressing growth rate changes relative to a baseline with the change
    in GMT. It incorporates different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs),
    Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), climate models (GCMs), and probabilistic
    TC time series, using a bootstrap approach to generate scenario combinations.
    The SCC is calculated following the approach by Ricke et al. (2018), using a coupled
    carbon-climate convolution integral approach.
  11: The analysis was implemented in Python 3.9, using CLI-MADA 3.3.3 and statsmodels
    0.13.5. The code is openly available. The paper uses a discrete time definition
    of discount rates.
More Notes:
  1: The increase in global SCC is mainly driven by the strongly TC-affected major
    greenhouse gas emitting countries India, USA, China, Taiwan, and Japan.
  3: The paper uses a model with eight lag years to account for the accumulation of
    persistent growth impacts. Four different global climate models are used in the
    TC emulator to generate probabilistic time series of TCs.
  6: The analysis incorporates country-level economic data, providing median loss
    estimates and confidence intervals.
  8: The analysis may underestimate damages due to not accounting for future adaptation
    and neglecting TC-related rainfall and storm surge.
  9: The paper uses data from the GSWP3-W5E5 historical reconstruction for temperature.
Quantitative material:
  1: Accounting for TC impacts increases the global SCC by more than 20%; median global
    SCC increases from US$ 173 to US$ 212 per tonne of CO2.
  2: "The page mentions calculating growth responses for a sample of 41 tropical cyclone-affected\
    \ countries over the period 1981\u20132015."
  3: Average annual growth losses for strongly exposed countries such as Japan (1.63%)
    or the Philippines (2.62%) were in the historical period on average 10 and 15
    times higher than for the only partially exposed USA (0.17%).
  4: The study finds the median global Damage from Additional Days (DAD) of global
    GDP ranges from 0.18% in 2021 to 1.13% by 2100, depending on the scenario.
  5: "Median global discounted annual damage (DAD) from tropical cyclone impacts averaged\
    \ over the period 2010-2100 for three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6,\
    \ 6.0, 8.5), two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2 and SSP5), and three different\
    \ values of the growth adjusted discount rates used in the Stern review, for the\
    \ standard calibration of Nordhaus\u2019s DICE model, and by Ricke et al. Also\
    \ includes 66% confidence intervals. Median country-level per-capita DAD averaged\
    \ over the period 2010\u20132100 for the 20 most impacted countries. Median average\
    \ per-capita DAD relative to 2019 average household income."
  6: The paper provides quantitative estimates of damage functions and socio-economic
    costs, indicating a 22% increase in social cost of carbon when accounting for
    tropical cyclones.
  7: "Global median SCC for 2010-2100 is estimated with and without TC effects under\
    \ different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic\
    \ Pathways (SSPs), and different discount rates. The study estimates a preferred\
    \ SCC of US$/tCO2 212 (66% CI: US$/tCO2 138\u2013318) when accounting for the\
    \ effect of TCs."
  8: TCs drive up the country-level social cost of carbon (SCC) by 68% for China,
    53% for the USA, and 9% for India; a substantial increase in global SCC by 22.2%
    and by 44.4% in TC-affected countries when accounting for TC impacts.
  9: "The paper generates 1200 artificial TC time series for each ocean basin and\
    \ uses global mean temperature ranges of 0.5\xB0C to 1.5\xB0C above pre-industrial\
    \ levels. It analyzes data from 41 countries affected by TCs in the historical\
    \ period 1981\u20132015. It also looks at a maximum of 8 lag years to analyze\
    \ TC impacts."
  10: "The analysis projects time series of TC-induced changes to national GDPpc growth\
    \ rates over the period 2010-2100. It also calculates the Discounted Annual Damages\
    \ (DAD) and the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). Structural dependence tests found\
    \ that the hypotheses \u03B3_(e,r,b,l,i) = 0 and \u03C9_(e,r,b,l,i) = 0 have to\
    \ be rejected at the 5% level of significance for between 58.5% and 86.5% of the\
    \ samples across uncertainty dimensions 5 and 6 (r and b), depending on the country\
    \ i."
  11: The paper calculates the TC-induced SCC (TC-SCC) as the difference between the
    SCC with and without the contribution of TCs. Machine-readable source data for
    all figures, supplementary figures, and supplementary tables are provided as CSV
