Drivers of Risk:
  1: Tropical cyclones (TCs), temperature increases due to global warming, extreme
    weather events, greenhouse gas emissions.
  2: Tropical cyclones (TCs); Different emission scenarios (RCPs); Socioeconomic development
    (SSPs); Economic discounting scenario combinations; Temperature change
  3: Future greenhouse gas emissions (UD1); Socioeconomic development (UD2); Normative
    assumptions on discounting (UD3); Historical growth response of countries to TCs
    (UD4); Response of TC impacts to future greenhouse gas emissions (UD5); Response
    of temperature to a greenhouse gas emission pulse (UD6); Changes of TC impacts
    (e.g., with respect to their location, timing, intensity, and frequency distributions
    of landfall) under future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
  4: Global mean temperature (GMT) increases, tropical cyclones (TCs), climate change,
    RCP-SSP scenarios
  5: Tropical cyclones, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, 6.0, 8.5),
    Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP2 and SSP5), growth adjusted discount rates.
  6: Global mean temperature (GMT) change relative to pre-industrial levels; Tropical
    cyclones (TCs); GHG Emissions; Discount Rate.
  7: Tropical cyclones (TC), climate change (via Representative Concentration Pathways
    - RCPs)
  9: Tropical cyclones (TCs), temperature changes (global mean temperature)
  10: Tropical cyclones (TC), temperature increases (related to climate change scenarios).
  11: Tropical cyclones (TCs), temperature-dependent damage from TCs, aggregate temperature-dependent
    damage function, climate change, ocean warming
  12: Global warming, tropical cyclones, extreme weather events, and climate change
    scenarios.
  13: Climate change impacts on agriculture; storm surge and sea-level rise on US
    Coasts; tropical cyclone climatology change exacerbates rainfall-surge hazard;
    natural disasters, specifically droughts; tropical cyclone exposure; temperature
    change
Highlights:
  1: Accounting for TC impacts substantially increases the global SCC by more than
    20%. The increase is mainly driven by strongly TC-affected major greenhouse gas
    emitting countries India, USA, China, Taiwan, and Japan. The benefits of climate
    policies could currently be substantially underestimated.
  2: Quantifies future TC damages; Assesses compounding uncertainties; Derives event-based,
    and country-specific temperature-dependent damage functions; Estimates the contribution
    from TCs to the overall SCC.
  3: "TC strikes reduce growth in the short-, mid-, and long-term. Heterogeneous exposure\
    \ of countries to TCs leads to substantially different induced growth losses.\
    \ The study estimates the discounted annual damage (DAD) over the period 2010\u2013\
    2100 to evaluate how TCs will affect TC-prone countries under global warming."
  4: Growth losses increase with GMT for most countries; High-income countries are
    also negatively affected by TCs suggesting adaptation is insufficient; The relationship
    between GMT and TC-induced growth rate changes is largely independent of the SSP
    scenarios but depends on the RCP.
  5: The paper presents median global discounted annual damage (DAD) from tropical
    cyclone impacts. It identifies the 20 most impacted countries and also presents
    damage as a percentage of household income.
  6: Tropical cyclones induce growth losses that scale with global mean temperature
    change; TCs lead to an increase in the social cost of carbon, particularly for
    large emitters; Discount rate has the largest impact on SCC estimates.
  7: Tropical cyclones increase the social cost of carbon, Low- and middle-income
    countries face larger relative adaptation challenges due to TC impacts compared
    to high-income countries.
  9: The study finds that temperature and tropical cyclone impacts affect GDPpc growth,
    with specific coefficients quantifying these effects. Temperature effects estimated
    are consistent with previous studies. Omitting TC or temperature effects does
    not significantly change estimated coefficients of each respective variable
  10: "The relationship between exogenous and endogenous variables cannot be explained\
    \ by the RCP-independent coefficients \u03B3r,b,li and \u03C9r,b,li alone, necessitating\
    \ accounting for structural dependence on RCPs. Hypotheses \u03B3e,r,b,li = 0\
    \ and \u03C9e,r,b,li = 0 are rejected at the 5% level of significance for between\
    \ 58.5% and 86.5% of the samples across uncertainty dimensions. Hypotheses \u03B3\
    s,r,b,li = 0 and \u03C9s,r,b,li = 0 cannot be rejected at the 10% level of significance."
  11: The TC-induced SCC (TC-SCC) is defined as the difference between the SCC with
    and without the contribution of TCs.
  12: Increased social cost of carbon estimates and the economic impact attributed
    to climate change related events.
  13: New science of climate change impacts on agriculture implies higher social cost
    of carbon; tropical cyclone climatology change greatly exacerbates US extreme
    rainfall-surge hazard; some contributions of integrated assessment models of global
    climate change; long-term growth effects of natural disasters, empirical evidence
    for droughts.
Methodology:
  1: Derive temperature-dependent damage functions for 41 TC-affected countries to
    quantify the country-level SCC induced by the persistent growth effects of damaging
    TCs.
  2: "A modeling framework comprising: historical growth responses to TC strikes accounting\
    \ for the persistence of damages, probabilistic event-based projections of TC\
    \ damages using a TC emulator, and event-based temperature-dependent damage functions.\
    \ Employs a three-way \uFB01xed effects panel model with annual national shares\
    \ of people exposed to TCs."
  3: Scenario analysis and probabilistic methods such as bootstrapping are used to
    project TC damages from 2010-2100. Six uncertainty dimensions are considered (UD1-UD6)
    and fully propagated through the modeling chain to account for compounding uncertainties.
    1200 bootstraps are generated per country.
  4: "Empirical growth model to translate affected people into GDP deviations; temperature\
    \ damage functions to translate warming into economic damages; event-based, country-level\
    \ temperature-dependent damage functions for TCs; mixed-effects modeling approach\
    \ with random effects for RCP dependencies; uses the difference in future GDP\
    \ per\u2013capita projections under climate damage with and without an additional\
    \ emission pulse."
  5: "The analysis uses different values of the growth adjusted discount rates used\
    \ in the Stern review and the standard calibration of Nordhaus\u2019s DICE model,\
    \ and by Ricke et al."
  6: Empirical growth model combined with process-based modeling of population exposure
    to TCs; Mixed-effects model; Damage functions based on temperature;  Considers
    uncertainty dimensions including persistence of growth losses.
  7: Uses DICE model, DAD (Damage as a percentage of income) analysis; considers uncertainty
    dimensions; parameters include lags, RCP scenarios, and discount rate choices.
  9: "Three-way fixed effects panel model regression analysis (Eq. 1) is used to estimate\
    \ the national GDPpc growth responses over the period 1981\u20132015. The model\
    \ incorporates country and time fixed effects, country-specific time trends, temperature\
    \ effects (quadratic function), and the impact of population exposure to strong\
    \ TC winds with lags up to 8 years. Bootstrapping is used to account for uncertainties."
  10: "Uses Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\
    \ (SSPs), CMIP5-GCMs, probabilistic TC time series, and bootstrap methods to project\
    \ TC-induced changes to national GDPpc growth rates. Estimates temperature-dependent\
    \ damage functions by regressing growth rate changes on changes in global mean\
    \ temperature (GMT). Calculates SCC following Ricke et al. (2018), considering\
    \ additional damage from a 1 GtC emission pulse in 2025. Applies growth-adjusted\
    \ discounting. Structural dependence tests using F-tests on hypotheses related\
    \ to parameters \u03B3 and \u03C9."

More Notes:
  1: Current estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC) do not account for the long-term
    effects of tropical cyclones (TCs).
  2: 'The study focuses on two complementary metrics of high policy relevance: DAD
    and SCC. It aims to develop tailored evidence-based National Adaptation Plans
    (NAPs).'
  4: Uncertainty in national shares of affected people and historical growth response
    to TC strikes are the largest sources of uncertainty. Discounting is a primary
    source of uncertainty.
  5: The statistical relationship between per-capita GDP growth and population-weighted
    annual mean temperatures is considered. They use a common regression framework
    to measure TC impacts.
  6: The framework can be extended to other extreme weather events with available
    event-based impact projections.
  7: The paper finds that differences in income among countries must not be neglected
    when comparing adaptation challenges. It also mentions a meta-analysis showing
    a quadrupling of median SCC estimates between 2007-2012 and 2018-2022. The paper
    focuses specifically on annual temperatures and TCs. Adaptation challenges are
    underestimated for lower-income populations because of their exposure to and need
    to recover from TC strikes.
  9: The analysis uses data from 166 countries (Burke et al.41 and Ricke et al.40),
    and an additional 8 TC-affected regions and countries. Historical temperature
    data is sourced from GSWP3-W5E5, and population data from HYDEv3.3. Future climate
    scenarios are based on GCM-RCP combinations from ISIMIP2b.
  10: "The analysis considers the persistence of growth losses by calculating growth\
    \ rate changes for 8 lag years. It uses growth-adjusted discount rates with the\
    \ rate of time preference \u03C1 and the consumption elasticity of marginal utility\
    \ \u03B7."
