  5: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  4: Increase in energy prices, rising interest rates, and the cost of infrastructure
    influenced future vulnerability and risk trends.
  5: Future changes in the intensity and distribution of hazardous events (tropical
    cyclone intensity, river flooding), accelerating global sea-level rise, local
    sea-level rise, land subsidence, population growth, urbanization, economic development,
    expansion of hydropower infrastructure, future global population
Highlights:
  4: Wealthy deltas like the Rhine and Mississippi currently benefit from risk-reducing
    investments; however, these strategies become less sustainable in more energy-constrained
    future scenarios.
  5: Economic ability and decisions to deploy engineering solutions will be key factors
    in repositioning most of the world's deltas into a future space of elevated risk.
Methodology:
  4: Analysis modeled risk trend changes by adjusting IDI scores with projections
    of energy price growth exceeding GDP.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  4: Estimates of increased future vulnerability for all deltas under a scenario with
    increased costs for risk reduction due to higher energy prices.
Quantitative material:
  4: "Netherlands modernization and improvement costs projected at \u20AC1 billion\
    \ to \u20AC2 billion per annum."
