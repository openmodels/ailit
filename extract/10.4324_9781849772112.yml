Drivers of Risk:
  7: Rising temperatures, falling water tables, climate change impacts on crop yields,
    energy policy decisions, transportation policy decisions (paving over cropland).
Highlights:
  7: Climate change is impacting crop yields and water availability, threatening food
    security; China's decline in grain production and shift to becoming a major importer
    is a key concern; Energy and transportation policies have significant implications
    for food security, possibly greater than agricultural policies.
More Notes:
  7: The paper suggests that projections often fail to account for the changing climate
    and its impact on agriculture. The paper suggests that the intersection of different
    sectors are critical to long-term food security.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  7: Food security, grain production, commodity prices, cropland area, export revenue.
Quantitative material:
  7: A 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature leads to a decline in wheat, rice, and
    corn yields of 10 percent; China's grain production dropped by 50 million tons
    between 1998 and 2004; China imported 8 million tons of wheat in 2004.
