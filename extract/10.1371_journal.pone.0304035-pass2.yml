Drivers of Risk:
  1: 'Environmental variations: average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum
    temperature, evapotranspiration, precipitation, runoff, soil moisture, vapor pressure,
    radiation, and wind speed.'
  2: Climate change, including temperature increases and changes in water supply,
    poses risks to agricultural production and food security in Colombia.
  4: Environmental variations in temperature and precipitation affecting agricultural
    production in Colombia.
  5: Environmental variations, specifically vapor pressure and minimum temperature.
  6: Average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, wind speed, vapor
    pressure, soil moisture, runoff, precipitation, radiation, evapotranspiration.
  8: Increases in average temperatures affect crop production (positive for palm oil
    and corn, negative for coffee, rice, and sugarcane).
  9: Environmental variations, droughts (maximum and minimum temperatures, wind speed),
    pests and diseases
  10: "Increase in minimum temperatures, increase in vapor pressure, temperature increases\
    \ in general, drought ('El Ni\xF1o')."
  11: Increases in temperature and vapor pressure, global warming, and extreme climatic
    conditions such as droughts and critical rainy seasons.
Highlights:
  1: Increases in average temperatures negatively impact coffee, rice, and sugarcane
    production but positively impact palm oil and corn production in Colombia.
  2: Climate change may impact agricultural productivity, requiring crop adaptation
    by 2050, with coffee needing higher altitudes and shade, while sugarcane, rice,
    and corn will need adaptation to high temperatures and less water consumption.
  4: The model assessed the influence of environmental variables on crop production
    for 5 crops and 11 environmental variables.
  5: Vapor pressure and minimum temperature are identified as the most impactful variables
    on crop production in Colombia.  Average temperatures have risen in Colombia from
    1960-2020.
  6: Average temperature increases might help corn and palm oil production, but affect
    coffee, sugarcane, and rice. Dry-air conditions might decrease coffee, corn, palm
    oil, and sugarcane production, but increase rice production. Wind speed increases
    might help palm oil and sugarcane production, but impact corn and rice production.
  8: Increases in average temperatures can affect coffee, rice, and sugarcane production
    negatively but can boost palm oil and corn production in Colombia.
  9: Some weather factors harmed crop production between 2007 and 2020.
  10: Coffee and rice production in Colombia are negatively impacted by rising temperatures
    and vapor pressure. Sugarcane is less affected. Adaptation strategies are needed,
    such as shifting coffee crops to higher altitudes and developing agroindustrial
    strategies.
  11: Environmental changes negatively impact traditional products such as coffee
    and rice, while potentially benefiting crops like corn and palm oil. Adaptation
    of the agricultural sector is necessary, including managing production location
    and implementing agro-industrial technologies.
Methodology:
  1: A Bayesian spatio-temporal model was used with production, climatic, and hydrological
    data from 1121 municipalities in Colombia from 2007 to 2020.
  2: The model measures the relationship between crop production and environmental
    conditions, focusing on coffee, corn, palm oil, rice, and sugarcane.
  3: The study uses a spatio-temporal Bayesian model to analyze the relationship between
    crop production and environmental variables in Colombian municipalities from 2007
    to 2020.
  4: A Bayesian model with Poisson counts was used to represent yearly crop production
    in 1121 municipalities in Colombia from 2007 to 2020; Included linear predictors
    of random effects using INLA for model estimation.
  5: Bayesian model is used to calculate the growth rate in production due to environmental
    variables, evaluating the exponential of the logarithmic scale value.

    production.

    agricultural products.
  9: The effect of environmental variations on the production of the principal agricultural
    products in Colombia was analyzed.
  10: Study of the effects of environmental variations on the production of principal
    agricultural products in Colombia.
  11: The study analyzes the effect of environmental variations on the production
    of principal agricultural products in Colombia, considering temperature, vapor
    pressure, and hydrological variables. Subsequent studies are recommended to consider
    drought periods and water availability.
More Notes:
  1: The agricultural sector in Colombia supports the national economy and food security.
    The paper suggests a need for land use substitution towards palm oil and corn.
    The abundance of water in Colombia may balance the impact of hydrological variables
    on crop production.
  4: Temperature has increased in Colombia, indicating a climate change process; high
    variability in annual precipitation was noted.
  5: The spatial distribution of different crops is influenced by altitude and weather
    conditions.
  6: The analysis focuses on Colombia.
  8: The paper suggests that the agricultural sector in Colombia needs to adjust land
    use, promoting the production of palm oil and corn. The increase in palm oil production
    might lead to deforestation, resulting in adverse environmental and social impacts.
  9: Colombia's diverse weather conditions provide competitive advantages for producing
    agricultural products like coffee, sugarcane, and palm oil, but droughts can lead
    to crop failures.
  10: The study acknowledges limitations related to estimating the impact of pests,
    plant diseases, and soil fertility.
  11: The study highlights the need for programs promoting crops with advantages in
    the changing climatic conditions in Colombia.
