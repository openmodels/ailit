0,FAO CPI Growth,Global,Historical,2016,No dry spells,percentage point,-0.1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,17,Effect of each additional dry spell day >28. Conditions on drought. Direct effect.
1,Crop Production Growth,Global,Historical,2000,No dry spell,% change/day,-0.0001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18,Estimated small negative impact.  Placeholder value used; page states the effect is negative.
2,Crop Production Growth,Global,Historical Data,2000,N/A,Percentage Points per Day,-0.0013,0.0007,NA,NA,NA,NA,42,Estimated effect of an additional dry spell day for a minimum dry spell duration of 28 days and a minimum heat wave duration of 9 days. Model (1): dry spell and heat wave measures are weighted temporally using cropped area by month from MIRCA2000 to approximate growing seasons. Clustered standard errors.
3,Crop Production Growth,Global,Historical Data,2000,N/A,Percentage Points per Day,-0.0012,0.0005,NA,NA,NA,NA,42,Estimated effect of an additional dry spell day for a minimum dry spell duration of 28 days and a minimum heat wave duration of 9 days. Model (2): SPEI is quantified just prior to the first of the 90-hottest day per cell. Clustered standard errors.
4,Crop Production Growth,Global,Historical Data,2000,N/A,Percentage Points per Day,-0.0011,0.0005,NA,NA,NA,NA,42,Estimated effect of an additional dry spell day for a minimum dry spell duration of 28 days and a minimum heat wave duration of 9 days. Model (3): adjust for counts of days in 10F temperature bins in addition to average temperature. Clustered standard errors.
5,Crop Production Growth,Global,Historical Data,2000,N/A,Percentage Points per Day,-0.0011,0.0005,NA,NA,NA,NA,42,Estimated effect of an additional dry spell day for a minimum dry spell duration of 28 days and a minimum heat wave duration of 9 days. Model (4): cubic precipitation and temperature terms. Clustered standard errors.
6,Crop Production Growth,Global,Historical Data,2000,N/A,Percentage Points per Day,-0.0011,0.0005,NA,NA,NA,NA,42,Estimated effect of an additional dry spell day for a minimum dry spell duration of 28 days and a minimum heat wave duration of 9 days. Model (5): quartic precipitation and temperature terms. Clustered standard errors.
7,Crop Production Growth,Global,Historical Data,2000,N/A,Percentage Points per Day,-0.0010,0.0005,NA,NA,NA,NA,42,Estimated effect of an additional dry spell day for a minimum dry spell duration of 28 days and a minimum heat wave duration of 9 days. Model (6): linear rather than quadratic per-country trends. Clustered standard errors.
8,Crop Production Growth,Global,Historical Data,2000,N/A,Percentage Points per Day,-0.0014,0.0005,NA,NA,NA,NA,42,Estimated effect of an additional dry spell day for a minimum dry spell duration of 28 days and a minimum heat wave duration of 9 days. Model (7): cubic rather than quadratic per-country trends. Clustered standard errors.
9,Crop Production Growth,Global,Historical Data,2000,N/A,Percentage Points per Day,-0.0012,0.0005,NA,NA,NA,NA,42,Estimated effect of an additional dry spell day for a minimum dry spell duration of 28 days and a minimum heat wave duration of 9 days. Model (8): add 1-year lags of all environmental variables. Clustered standard errors.
10,Crop Production Growth,Global,Historical Data,2000,N/A,Percentage Points per Day,-0.0007,0.0005,NA,NA,NA,NA,42,"Estimated effect of an additional dry spell day for a minimum dry spell duration of 28 days and a minimum heat wave duration of 9 days. Model (9): add lagged log value added per capita in agriculture, fisheries, and forestry. Clustered standard errors."
11,Crop Production Growth,Global,Historical Data,2000,N/A,Percentage Points per Day,-0.0008,0.0005,NA,NA,NA,NA,42,Estimated effect of an additional dry spell day for a minimum dry spell duration of 28 days and a minimum heat wave duration of 9 days. Model (10): same as (9) but instrument for the added term using lagged log GDP per capita. Clustered standard errors.
12,Crop Production Growth,Global,Historical Data,2000,N/A,Percentage Points per Day,-0.0010,0.0007,NA,NA,NA,NA,42,"Estimated effect of an additional dry spell day for a minimum dry spell duration of 28 days and a minimum heat wave duration of 9 days. Model (11): use log of value added per capita in agriculture, fisheries, and forestry as an alternate outcome. Clustered standard errors."
