Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change and socioeconomic factors impacting water usage.
  2: Socioeconomic scenarios (SSPs) and climate models (RCPs) are used to project
    future water use, reflecting the impacts of emissions levels and socioeconomic
    factors.
  3: Climate change leading to changes in precipitation and temperature, affecting
    potential evapotranspiration (PET) and water yield.
  6: Population changes, climate change (precipitation and potential evapotranspiration)
  7: "Changes in effective precipitation (\u0394P\u2019) and potential evapotranspiration\
    \ (\u0394ETp) impacting water availability for domestic use, irrigation, and thermoelectric\
    \ power generation."
  8: Changes in temperature increasing demand for space cooling, shifts in electricity
    generation mix (e.g., away from nuclear, towards gas and renewables), changes
    in per-capita electricity demand growth (influenced by energy efficiency and manufacturing
    declines)
  9: Increase in temperature affects electricity consumption and regional water use
    needs.
  11: Decreased precipitation in the northern and southern Great Plains impacting
    industrial water use under high growth scenarios; Growth in electricity demand,
    impacting thermoelectric water use
  13: Climate change (modeled using RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), population growth (modeled
    using SSP1 and SSP5), agricultural practices
  15: Uncertainty in future drivers of water use (e.g., climate, population); Rapid
    changes in how Americans use water; Droughts
  19: Spatial changes in 30-year average of annual potential evapotranspiration in
    response to future climate change, analyzed under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
Highlights:
  1: Water use could decrease by 8% under the best-case scenario or increase by 235%
    under the worst-case scenario, with agriculture being a dominant factor in water
    usage.
  3: The most consistent results across models are increases in precipitation and
    yield for much of the western United States and decreases in water yield in the
    South.
  7: A new USGS approach utilizes EIA-reported data on fuel consumption and net electricity
    generation, in light of water availability, to model the heat and water budgets
    of 1,274 individual thermoelectric utility plants
  8: The study suggests that projections of future water use will provide a baseline
    for the status quo, but may over-project future water use for thermoelectric generation
    given current trends in energy production.
  9: Thermoelectric power generation requires more water in the East; domestic water
    use has declined despite population growth.
  11: Industrial water use increases are expected in the northern and southern Great
    Plains under high growth scenarios, while those regions also see decreased precipitation.
    Thermoelectric water consumption is projected to significantly increase by 2070.
  13: Total consumptive water use varies significantly by climate model and SSP scenario,
    particularly under RCP 8.5. The Intermountain region sees a large increase in
    water use, driven by livestock and population growth.
  15: Projections generally performed well, but there were notable overestimates for
    WRRs 4 and 5 (Great Lakes and Ohio regions) and underestimates for WRRs 2 and
    16 (Mid-Atlantic and Great Basin regions); Differences between projections and
    observed data represent economic shifts larger than those observed in historical
    data trends; Large declines in manufacturing led to reductions beyond what was
    expected in manufacturing centers of the U.S.
  19: The maps illustrate varying patterns of climate change, with more pronounced
    changes (increases in brown shades) under RCP 8.5.
Methodology:
  1: Projections based on IPCC Fifth Assessment Report scenarios and five climate
    models from MACA, examining future water use over the next 50 years.
  2: Climate futures are drawn from five MACA climate models for the Continental United
    States (CONUS).
  3: Climate projections are used to model changes in water yield, considering different
    scenarios of future emissions and socioeconomic growth (RCPs and SSPs). VIC (Variable
    Infiltration Capacity) model is used to model land-atmosphere fluxes.
  6: Future water withdrawals for livestock and aquaculture are based on human population
    at the WRR (Water Resources Region) spatial scale, apportioned to individual counties
    based on past withdrawals. Withdrawals are converted to consumptive use using
    state-level proportions. Climate change effects on domestic water withdrawals
    are calculated as a combination of changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration.
  7: Computes changes in domestic water withdrawals based on regressions using data
    at the WRR scale. Calculates changes in irrigation withdrawals based on changes
    in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Uses a new USGS approach based
    on EIA data on fuel consumption and electricity generation to model heat and water
    budgets of thermoelectric plants.
  8: Projects future water consumption for thermoelectric generation by projecting
    net electric energy produced at freshwater thermoelectric plants and water consumption
    rates at the county level; uses state-level data on thermoelectric generation
    and consumption to project future per-capita electricity demand; aggregates demand
    to energy regions and then apportions it to counties; introduces a multiplier
    to represent the effect of temperature increase on per-capita electricity consumption
    to account for increased space cooling
  9: Temperature change impact on electricity consumption, extrapolated using ratios
    from Sailor and Pavlova's study on cities to WRRs, and analysis of water usage.
  11: The analysis projects industrial and thermoelectric water use based on socioeconomic
    and climatic scenarios.
  15: Compared 2015 water withdrawal projections from Brown et al. (2013) with 2015
    withdrawal data from USGS circulars, broken down by water resource region (WRR).
  19: Analysis based on spatial changes in potential evapotranspiration under RCP
    4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, with results visualized as maps showing changes across
    different climate regions (Wet, Warm, Mid, Hot, Dry) and timeframes (mid-century
    and end-century).
More Notes:
  1: Dry regions are most affected, and efficiency gains are outpaced by population
    growth in fast-growing regions.
  3: The quadrant chart describes different future socioeconomic and emissions scenarios
    that are being used for projections of impact. Warmer temperatures in the South
    are projected to increase potential evapotranspiration (PET) more than for any
    other region of the U.S., amplifying the effects of decreased precipitation and
    leading to further declines in water yield.
  6: The study projects desired water use without considering water supply constraints,
    suitable for projections but would require vulnerability analysis. Consumptive
    use is the amount of water withdrawn that is not returned to the system.
  7: The paper focuses on modeling water withdrawals and consumption in the U.S.,
    particularly for domestic, irrigation, and thermoelectric uses, in response to
    climate change-induced changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration.
  8: The analysis focuses on the water-energy nexus, specifically how climate change
    and electricity generation choices affect water consumption; it uses a downscaling
    approach, starting with state-level projections and ending with county-level estimates.
  9: Population growth in driest regions projected to increase domestic water use
    in certain scenarios.
  11: The stagnant real GDP in manufacturing between 2005-2015 suggests a shift in
    the economy that may affect industrial water use projections. The South Atlantic-Gulf
    region is expected to dominate the share of thermoelectric water consumption in
    the United States by 2070.
  13: Agriculture is the dominant use of water, and climate model projections often
    vary more than SSP projections, especially under RCP 8.5. The West and parts of
    the Southeast see relatively large increases in water use for many of the scenarios.
  15: Population and income projections are taken from Wear and Prestemon (2019) and
    downscaled to the county-scale using economic growth theory and fixed-effects
    panel models.
  19: The study focuses on evapotranspiration, a key factor influencing water resources,
    which is relevant for understanding climate change impacts, but the specific economic
    implications are not discussed on this page.
