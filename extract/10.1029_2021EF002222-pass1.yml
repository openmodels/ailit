Drivers of Risk:
  1: The main drivers impacting freshwater use outcomes include climate change, population
    growth, and agricultural water use.
  2: The analysis considers socioeconomic scenarios (SSPs 1, 2, 3, and 5) and climate
    models (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) as drivers of risk. Population growth, income, temperature
    and precipitation.
  3: Warmer temperatures are projected to increase potential evapotranspiration (PET),
    amplifying the effects of decreased precipitation, particularly in the South.
    Climate projections (precipitation, temperature), and socioeconomic growth (scenarios)
    drive the water yield projections.
  4: Temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and precipitation (based on downscaled
    global climate model runs) are used to estimate the effects of future climate
    change on water withdrawal rates.
  5: Annual growth rate (g), decay rate (d)
  6: Climate change impacts domestic water withdrawals through changes in precipitation
    and potential evapotranspiration.
  8: Temperature increases impacting space-cooling demand, influencing thermoelectric
    water use.
  9: Change in annual temperature; population growth
  11: Decreased precipitation in some regions, increased per capita electricity demand,
    and gross domestic product growth are drivers of risk. Transition to closed loop
    cooling systems in power plants is also relevant.
  12: Warmer temperatures associated with climate change, population growth, and drought
    are identified as drivers of risk.
  13: Climate change (implied through RCP scenarios) and population growth are identified
    as drivers of changes in water use. The difference between wet and dry climate
    scenarios is also mentioned.
  14: Climate models (wet, middle, and dry) leading to changes in water yield; socioeconomic
    factors (population growth, technology adoption, energy demand); emissions scenarios
    (RCP 8.5); shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP5).
  15: Economic shifts, changes in manufacturing, and agricultural water use adjustments
    due to droughts were impactful factors.
  16: Changes in the spatial patterns of precipitation, water yield, and potential
    evapotranspiration are considered.
  17: Changes in annual precipitation under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, further
    subdivided into Wet, Warm, Mid, Hot, Dry scenarios, assessed at mid-century and
    end-century.
  18: Future climate change, specifically RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios
  19: Spatial changes in 30-year average of annual potential evapotranspiration in
    response to future climate change under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.
  20: Climate change is the main driver, specifically its impact on water availability,
    streamflow, and drought patterns. Socioeconomic factors such as population growth,
    agricultural demands, and energy production also contribute.

  20: The listed papers primarily evaluate water supply stress, water use, and drought
    impacts across various sectors (agriculture, municipal, energy) in the United
    States.
Highlights:
  1: Key outcomes include large variability in regional freshwater use, driven by
    climate scenarios, with agriculture as a dominant factor.
  2: The study highlights where the status quo of water use is unsustainable and where
    management actions are most needed. The southeast and western U.S. are projected
    to have the highest rates of population growth. Rural areas are projected to see
    little to no population growth, or even declining populations.
  3: Climate projections show high variability between models. The South is projected
    to see decreased water yield under dry climate models, while wet and hot models
    project increases. The Western US shows increases in precipitation and yield,
    while the South shows decreases in water yield.
  8: Projections indicate likely overestimation of future water use due to energy
    mix changes towards renewables and gas steam, reducing water withdrawals and consumption.
  9: The long-term effect on electricity consumption is smallest in southern, hotter
    areas and rises progressively moving north. Most regions of the U.S. are expected
    to see declines or only modest increases in domestic water use for low and moderate
    growth scenarios, except in the southern and western parts of the U.S. Under the
    high growth SSP5 scenario, most counties across the U.S. are projected to see
    increases in domestic water use.
  11: The Northern and Southern Great Plains are projected to see large increases
    in industrial water use, coupled with decreased precipitation. Thermoelectric
    water consumption is projected to increase significantly, especially in the South
    Atlantic-Gulf region, Midwest, and Texas-Gulf.
  12: Climate change could significantly increase water use for power generation.
    Water use for irrigation is projected to increase, especially in the East.
  13: Agriculture is the dominant use of water, leading to results that often vary
    more by climate model than SSP, particularly under RCP 8.5. The Intermountain
    region sees significant increases in water use, driven by livestock and population
    growth. Total consumptive use in the Intermountain region under RCP 8.5 can be
    nearly twice as high in the dry scenario as in the wet scenario.
  14: Under wet and middle climate models, water use decreases even with high emissions
    and population growth. The driest parts of the country face a future with less
    water and higher demand. Socioeconomic factors are primary determinants of domestic
    water use. Population growth in the West and Southwest could double domestic withdrawals.
    The interaction between socioeconomic and climate impacts is also seen in the
    thermoelectric sector. Future innovation could be more rapid.
  15: Projections overestimated withdrawals in Great Lakes and Ohio regions (WRRs
    4 and 5) and underestimated in Mid-Atlantic and Great Basin regions (WRRs 2 and
    16).
  16: No relevant information
  17: RCP 8.5 shows more extreme changes than RCP 4.5. 'Wet' and 'Warm' scenarios
    project increased wetness/warmth. 'Dry' and 'Hot' scenarios project increased
    dryness/heat. Changes are more pronounced by end-century compared to mid-century,
    especially under RCP 8.5.
  18: Maps depict potential changes in climate over the U.S. under different scenarios
    and conditions, impacting water yield; Blue shades indicate lower than average,
    and Brown shades indicate higher than average water yields.
  19: RCP 8.5 shows stronger warming and drying trends compared to RCP 4.5, especially
    towards the end of the century; spatial variability of climate change impacts
    across different U.S. regions is highlighted.
  20: The research highlights the vulnerability of US water supply to shortages and
    the importance of considering regional water connectivity, water productivity,
    and socioeconomic factors in mitigating climate change impacts. The role of different
    sectors (agriculture, energy, municipal) in future water shortages is also emphasized.
Methodology:
  1: Projections are based on socioeconomic and climate scenarios from the IPCC Fifth
    Assessment Report, utilizing multiple climate models.
  2: The methodology extrapolates past trends of withdrawal rates (e.g., water use
    per capita) and applies them to projections of water-using units (population,
    acres irrigated). It uses five climate models from the downscaled Multivariate
    Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA). The projections are based on combining SSPs
    and RCPs, but the paper uses the CMIP5 convention of keeping them separate. Results
    are applicable to projections of future freshwater use.
  3: The VIC model is used to simulate land-atmosphere fluxes and water and energy
    balance, calculating potential evapotranspiration using the Penman-Monteith equation.
    Water use projections are tied to RCP and SSP scenarios.
  4: Water use is modeled at the county level, building on previous work and improving
    the spatial resolution. Withdrawals are calculated for freshwater sources and
    consumptive use for each sector. Sector-specific withdrawals represent the sum
    of publicly-supplied and self-supplied water. Withdrawal rates are computed as
    the sum of a rate without climate change effects and the change caused by climate
    change. Past trends in rates of water withdrawal are estimated assuming that climate
    change has not affected past withdrawals.
  5: The paper projects future water withdrawal at the county level using growth and
    decay rates calculated from 1985-2015 withdrawal data, separated into eastern
    and western divisions based on Water Resource Regions (WRR). A 5-year time step
    is used, reflecting the USGS water use reporting schedule.
  6: Future livestock and aquaculture water withdrawals are projected based on human
    population at the WRR spatial scale and then apportioned to counties based on
    past withdrawals. Domestic sector water withdrawal changes due to climate change
    are computed as a function of changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration.
    Consumptive use is calculated using withdrawal proportions at the state level.
  8: The analysis projects future water consumption for thermoelectric generation
    by county, using state-level growth projections for electricity demand and water
    consumption rates.
  9: Coefficients are used to estimate the proportional increase in electricity consumption
    due to temperature changes. Ratios of total to short-term increases are calculated
    based on data from 12 cities and extended to 18 Water Resource Regions (WRRs).
    Proportions of residential and commercial electricity consumption are applied
    across WRRs to calculate a multiplier for change in thermoelectric energy production.
    Domestic water use projections are based on population growth scenarios (SSP3,
    SSP5) and trends in water use efficiency.
  10: No relevant information
  11: The analysis projects water use for industrial and thermoelectric sectors between
    2015 and 2070 under different socioeconomic and climatic scenarios.
  12: The analysis projects water use for thermoelectric power generation and irrigation
    through 2070 using unspecified scenarios and models.
  13: The analysis uses RCP and SSP scenarios to project future water demand. Livestock
    water demand projections do not include climate effects.
  14: Climate models are used to project future water yield under different scenarios.
    Socioeconomic factors are incorporated to project water demand in different sectors
    (domestic, agriculture, thermoelectric). The analysis assumes technology and the
    share of thermoelectric generation will remain near current levels. The projections
    serve as a benchmark for potential water demand for a thermoelectric generation
    if the status quo continues.

  19: The analysis uses RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate scenarios to project changes in
    potential evapotranspiration for mid-century and end-century.
  20: A variety of methodologies are employed, including hydro-economic modeling,
    statistical analysis, scenario analysis using Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs),
    and multi-model assessments.

  12: "Warmer temperatures could increase water use for power generation by 20%\u2013\
    60%, depending on the scenario. Rising temperatures could increase thermoelectric\
    \ water use by an extra 6 billion gallons per day in extreme cases. Total water\
