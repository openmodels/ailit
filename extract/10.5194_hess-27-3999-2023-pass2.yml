Drivers of Risk:
  3: Future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use change scenarios based on
    integrated assessments and assumptions regarding socioeconomic developments, climate
    mitigation efforts, and global governance (Kriegler et al., 2017).
  6: Changes in soil moisture content due to different climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6,
    SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). Changes in runoff percentiles under various
    Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) are shown for Africa.
  10: Changes in soil moisture, specifically drying or wetting trends, influenced
    by changes in precipitation, runoff, and evaporation. Drying trends can occur
    despite increased precipitation due to greater evaporative demand.
  13: Changes in soil moisture, both wet and dry departures, driven by different climate
    scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0) and varying Effective Climate Sensitivity (ECS)
    across climate models.
Drivers_of_Risk:
  14: Changes in soil moisture levels in various regions of the world driven by different
    climate scenarios.
Highlights:
  3: Root zone soil moisture departures act as an early warning for regions that are
    projected to have a permanently different water cycle in the coming decades.
  6: Soil moisture content varies significantly across different climate models. Runoff
    changes in Africa show a range of increases and decreases depending on the SSP
    scenario.
  10: Soil moisture changes vary regionally, with some regions experiencing consistent
    drying or wetting regardless of season, while others show seasonal differences
    (e.g., high-latitude regions drier in summer, wetter in winter).
  13: Some climate models predict more widespread and pronounced soil moisture departures
    due to high ECS values. Southern Europe may experience severe impacts on crop
    production due to soil moisture trends. Wet departures in very dry regions like
    the Sahara might have limited implications despite appearing significant in relative
    change analysis.
  14: Significant projected soil moisture changes in the Mediterranean, southern Africa,
    southern North America, and South America with substantial drying; and considerable
    wet departures in northern Africa, south-eastern South America, and South Asia.
Methodology:
  3: The total soil moisture content of different SSPs between 2021 and 2100 was compared
    with the PiControl baseline to determine whether and when the deviation of the
    total soil moisture content from the baseline becomes permanent.
  6: Climate models (IPSL-CM6A-LR, ACCESS-CM2, EC-Earth3, MIROC-ES2L) are used to
    project soil moisture content under the PiControl scenario and deviations in yearly
    mean total soil moisture content between 2071 and 2100. Runoff changes in Africa
    are analysed using the SSP scenarios.
  10: Climate model analysis (SSP1-2.6 scenario) examining root zone soil moisture
    departures from a baseline across various climate regions.
  13: Analysis based on CMIP6 climate models, focusing on root zone soil moisture
    departures from a PiControl baseline. The study defines permanence as a departure
    without reversal until 2100. The data is aggregated using IPCC climate reference
    regions.
  14: Analysis of future changes in total soil moisture using scenarios from 14 Earth
    System Models (ESMs) in CMIP6, considering permanent departures beyond pre-industrial
    variability.
More Notes:
  3: The study uses total soil moisture content as a proxy for root zone soil moisture,
    assuming changes in total soil moisture reflect changes in the hydrological active
    zone. The study analyzes the net number of ESMs that project a permanent departure
    in each region.
  6: The study focuses on hydrological variables like soil moisture and runoff, providing
    insights into water availability and potential impacts on agriculture and other
    sectors. The paper doesn't directly quantify macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes
    but provides a basis for assessing the physical risks that could lead to such
    outcomes.
  10: The study suggests a connection between precipitation changes and topsoil moisture
    changes, but also highlights the role of evaporative demand in influencing soil
    moisture, even in areas with increasing precipitation. A quantitative analysis
    of the relative impacts of precipitation, runoff, and evaporation was considered
    beyond the scope of this paper.
  13: The time of emergence is sensitive to small fluctuations in soil moisture. Spatial
    aggregation can lead to overestimation or underestimation of the percentage of
    land area with departures. Ensemble medians are used for land areas with permanent
    departures, and the difference between mean and median values is shown in Figure
    S26.

    of global warming, with strong signals in specific global regions.
