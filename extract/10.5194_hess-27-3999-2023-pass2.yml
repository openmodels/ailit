Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Climate change/global warming as defined by shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs)\
    \ SSP1\u20132.6, SSP2\u20134.5, SSP3\u20137.0, and SSP5\u20138.5 between 2021\
    \ and 2100."
  3: Changes occurring in the total soil moisture
  4: Projected changes in soil moisture under SSP scenarios, including the SSP5-8.5
    scenario, indicate potential prolonged wet or dry conditions.
  5: Increasing temperatures in scenario projections lead to soil moisture changes
    and drying or wetting of regions.
  6: Changes in total soil moisture content due to different climate scenarios (PiControl,
    SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5).
  7: Changes in soil moisture are driven by different climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6,
    SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) representing varying levels of greenhouse gas concentrations.
  8: Higher warming scenarios increase the land area with monthly wet or dry soil
    moisture departures.
  9: Changes in regional total soil moisture content (both dry and wet departures
    from a baseline).
  10: Soil moisture changes (drying or wetting) are driven by changes in precipitation,
    runoff, and evaporation. Seasonality also plays a role, with high-latitude regions
    tending to be drier in summer and wetter in winter.
  11: The change in evaporative demand is mentioned as a factor affecting precipitation
    changes.
  12: Changes in soil moisture (both wet and dry extremes) driven by different SSP
    scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) and increases in atmospheric
    carbon dioxide.
  13: Changes in soil moisture (both wet and dry departures) are driven by different
    climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0) and model effective climate sensitivity
    (ECS).
  14: "Different scenarios (SSP1\u20132.6, SSP2\u20134.5, SSP3\u20137.0, and SSP5\u2013\
    8.5) from 14 ESMs in CMIP6 impacting soil moisture."
  15: Changes in soil moisture content driven by different climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6,
    SSP3-7.0, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5) and seasons (boreal summer, boreal winter).
  16: Anthropogenic warming and land system change are crucial drivers of permanent
    dry and wet departures from pre-industrial soil moisture variability.
  19: The paper analyzes departures in rootzone soil moisture from a pre-industrial
    baseline.

  16: Evaluation of root zone soil moisture departures and their transgression of
    the planetary boundary under different SSP scenarios by the end of the 21st century.
  19: The paper by Lai et al. focuses on the variability of rootzone soil moisture.
Highlights:
  1: Permanent dry departures were found to be most pronounced in Central America,
    southern Africa, the Mediterranean region, and most of South America, whereas
    permanent wet departures are most pronounced in south-eastern South America, northern
    Africa, and southern Asia.
  4: Significant deviations in soil moisture content from pre-industrial levels are
    projected; the time of emergence marks when these deviations become permanent.
  5: Under warmer scenarios, most regions in North and South America become drier;
    regions in northern Africa and eastern Europe become wetter.
  6: Warmer climate scenarios increase the frequency of models with monthly permanent
    soil moisture departures. Some regions show contrasting results between ensemble
    members (e.g., Asia, northern North America). The projections of precipitation
    over Africa are different depending on the SSP, with SSP5-8.5 showing more significant
    reductions in precipitation.
  7: Global land area with wet or dry departures increases from 2021 to 2100. More
    regions are projected to experience an increase in soil moisture compared to a
    decrease across all scenarios. SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios show more areas
    with higher drought frequency compared to SSP2 scenarios over Africa and South
    America.
  8: Larger land areas will have permanent wet departures compared to dry departures;
    climates with higher warming have a higher rate of increase in wet departure areas.
  9: "Maps show permanent dry departures (red shading) and permanent wet departures\
    \ (blue shading) for each SSP scenario. In both SSP1\u20132.6 and SSP3\u20137.0,\
    \ seasonal permanent wet and dry departures are comparable, but seasonal permanent\
    \ dry departure remains higher in boreal summer than in boreal winter. In SSP3-7.0,\
    \ the land area with permanent wet and dry departures in boreal summer is similar,\
    \ but in winter, the land area with wet departures is much larger than for dry\
    \ departures. The paper indicates that there is drying of soil moisture in 2100."
  10: Some regions consistently experience either drying or wetting of soils regardless
    of season. High-latitude regions tend to become drier in summer and wetter in
    winter.
  11: The impact of model independence on model spread is highlighted, suggesting
    that model divergences provide valuable insights into potential futures rather
    than indicating flaws.
  12: ESMs have high uncertainties in certain regions (e.g., the Sahel and the Amazon).
    There are conflicting departure signals among ESMs in certain regions, especially
    at higher northern latitudes. The land cover in most ESMs is prescribed, but soil
    moisture dynamics are impacted by land cover adaptation and change.
  13: Soil moisture trends sometimes concur with expected impacts, e.g., drying in
    Southern Europe aligns with projected impacts on crop production. Wet departures
    are shown to occur in very dry regions, although absolute changes are of rather
    low magnitudes. Models with higher ECS values may predict more widespread and
    pronounced departures than would be realistic.
  14: '- Remarkable drying in the Mediterranean, southern Africa, southern North America,
    and South America (except south-eastern South America). - Considerable wet departures
    were detected in northern Africa, south-eastern South America, and South Asia.
    - The magnitude of drying and wetting increases with the effect of global warming
    in most regions.'
  15: Significant regional differences in soil moisture departures are projected across
    North America, Asia, and Australia. Asia shows lower agreement between ESMs. Permanent
    wet departures are projected to increase with higher SSP scenarios.
  16: A substantial percentage of the land surface is projected to experience permanent
    soil moisture departures even under low-emission scenarios, with more serious
    transgressions in higher emission scenarios.
Methodology:
  1: "Analyzed root zone soil moisture departures from pre-industrial climate variability\
    \ using a multi-model ensemble of 14 Earth system models (ESMs) in the Coupled\
    \ Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) in four climate scenarios as defined\
    \ by the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) SSP1\u20132.6, SSP2\u20134.5, SSP3\u2013\
    7.0, and SSP5\u20138.5 between 2021 and 2100.  Defined permanent departures as\
    \ when a region's soil moisture exits the regional variability envelope of the\
    \ pre-industrial climate and does not fall back into the range covered by the\
    \ baseline envelope until 2100. The analyses were done for 43 ice-free climate\
    \ reference regions used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)."
  4: The analysis uses model ensemble data to calculate soil moisture departures,
    taking monthly averages from SSP and PiControl scenarios to determine baselines
    and projections.
  5: The study compares ensemble medians of climate model scenarios to determine soil
    moisture content changes and emergence from baseline.
  6: ESM models are used to simulate soil moisture content under different climate
    scenarios. The analysis focuses on comparing the deviation of soil moisture between
    future SSP scenarios and the PiControl baseline. Regions with lower soil moisture
    are shown in red, and higher in blue.
  7: Analysis compares soil moisture content between 2071-2100 and a PiControl baseline,
    and assesses permanent departures from the PiControl baseline between 2021 and
    2100. 12-month rolling means of monthly departures are used.
  8: The analysis uses various SSP scenarios to project soil moisture changes and
    considers time of emergence for these changes.
  9: The analysis uses regional ensemble means calculated from the numbers of months
    with wet or dry departures in each climate model under different SSP scenarios
    (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5).
  10: The study analyzes root zone soil moisture departures from a PiControl baseline
    using climate model simulations under the SSP1-2.6 scenario.
  11: The analysis conducted does not weigh models based on performance or interdependence;
    model spread reflects a range of potential future scenarios.
  12: ESM simulations are used to project root zone soil moisture departures under
    different SSP scenarios. The analysis covers the period from 2015 to 2100. The
    percentage of land area is derived from these simulations.
  13: Analysis is based on simulations up to 2100, using CMIP6 models. Permanence
    is defined as departure without reversal until 2100. Aggregated data using IPCC
    climate reference regions, reported as ensemble medians. Relative change is used.
  14: "Analysis of future (2021\u20132100) changes in total soil moisture using CMIP6\
    \ models under different SSP scenarios. Evaluation of deviation from PiControl,\
    \ permanent departures, and time of emergence."
  15: ESM (Earth System Model) ensemble median analysis of soil moisture content changes
    in 2100 compared to the PiControl scenario.
  16: CMIP6 ESM data from the Earth System Grid Federation were analyzed using Python;
    data were used to evaluate soil moisture departures under different SSP scenarios.
  19: The dataset relates to rootzone soil moisture and uses CMIP6 model output from
    NOAA-GFDL GFDL-ESM4 (related citation also on the page).
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on 'permanent departures' of root zone soil moisture, defined
    as exceeding the pre-industrial variability range and not returning by 2100. The
    study highlights the importance of mitigation.
  5: Inconsistency in departure patterns is observed in Asia between neighboring regions
    under different scenarios.
  6: The paper uses ensemble medians for the deviation maps. The analysis identifies
    regions with permanent departures in soil moisture, with many models projecting
    either wet or dry departures for all 12 months. The figures and text show that
    projected changes in soil moisture depend heavily on both region and SSP.
  9: The included figure pertains to changes in wildfire risk, namely increases and
    decreases in the number of months with high wildfire risk under various SSP scenarios.
    The maps utilize color-coding to represent these changes, with red shades indicating
    increases and green/blue shades indicating decreases.
  10: The analysis considers permanent departures from baseline variability, offering
    a perspective on long-term changes rather than short-term fluctuations.
  11: There is a focus on the interpretation of model spread not as error but as a
    range of potential outcomes due to different hypotheses in Earth System Models
    (ESMs).
  12: Model spread has been observed since CMIP5. There are limitations due to prescribed
    land cover and potential inconsistencies with water and energy balance in offline
    simulations.
  13: The interpretation of the results can be different when looking at ensemble
    means or medians. Longer simulation periods beyond 2100 might affect the estimations
    of areas with permanence and the associated time of emergence. Spatial aggregation
    loses a degree of information.
  14: The agreement between ESMs is higher in regions with strong departure signals.
    Some models, like CNRM-ESM2-1, may report higher dry departures than others, indicating
    potential outliers.
  15: The paper also includes supplementary figures (Fig. S23 and S24) that present
    the results for SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios.
