Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temporal and spatial variability of precipitation (drought and flood risks) challenge
    water and food security.
  3: Changes in climatic conditions, specifically drought (measured by PDSI) and precipitation
    (PRCP).
  4: Prolonged and widespread drought in southern Africa
  5: "The drought of 1991\u20131992 is clearly reflected in the trade figures. Imports\
    \ by southern Africa increased more than four-fold from 1991\u20131992, and decreased\
    \ by three-fold from 1992\u20131993."
  6: Drought impacts and PDSI (Palmer Drought Severity Index) relationships with maize
    VWC (Virtual Water Content) indicate increased irrigation and water demand during
    droughts.
  7: Drought severity impacts agricultural GDP in Angola, Namibia, and Zambia; and
    rainfall variability affects GDP and agricultural productivity.
  8: Low levels of economic development and political instability hinder improvements
    in agricultural production and water productivity.
  9: "Strong El Ni\xF1o events linked to severe droughts impacting southern Africa\
    \ during 1991-1992 and 1994-1995."
  11: Severe extreme events (e.g. 1992 and 1995 droughts) impact yield, water use,
    trade and Water Stress (WS).
Highlights:
  4: Crop VWC values peak across most of the region in 1992, especially for irrigation-based
    VWC, reflecting an unusually low crop water productivity, due to the prolonged
    and widespread drought in southern Africa at the time.
  5: Extra-regional food trade, between southern Africa and the RoW, is an order of
    magnitude larger than regional trade, in both directions
  6: Maize trade significantly contributes to water savings in drought years; irrigation
    use increases with drought severity, and there are significant linear relationships
    for Namibia, Angola, and Madagascar.
  7: Rainfall increases are positively related to agricultural GDP in Namibia and
    Zimbabwe; drought severity decreases GDP in Angola, Namibia, and Zambia.
  8: Dependence of southern Africa on other regions for its food supply has shown
    considerable fluctuations. Maize imports from the RoW are relatively large compared
    to domestic production.
  9: Severe droughts during 1991-1992 significantly reduced agricultural production,
    notably halving maize yields in several southern African countries.
  11: Imports to compensate food deficits and exports to recover from drought-induced
    production shocks have both been from more to less water productive areas, highlighting
    the role of trade in driving efficient allocation of resources.
Methodology:
  3: The study uses linear regressions to compare climate indices (PDSI, PRCP) with
    VWC, Trade, and agricultural GDP for Southern African nations from 1986-2011.
    Gridded versions of PRCP and PDSI are also regressed against gridded maize yields.
  4: "perform panel linear regression on the entire dataset\u201413 countries and\
    \ 27 years\u2014between agricultural GDP, maize VWC, VWI and food imports on the\
    \ one hand and WAP(+) and WAP(-) on the other hand, with country \uFB01xed effects."
  5: "Virtual water trade: The evolution of regional VWT is similar to that of regional\
    \ food trade. Indeed, given the de\uFB01nition of VWT, if VWC shows no clear trend\
    \ over time, then food trade and VWT will have similar trends."
  6: The analysis involves comparing time-series data of national annual PDSI and
    PRCP indices with VWC, food imports, VWIs, GDP, and gridded maize yield using
    linear regressions.
  7: Analysis includes linear regression with fixed effects and panel regression,
    assessing impact of climate variables on economic outcomes at a national level.
More Notes:
  1: No relevant information
  4: "Green water generally dominates VWC over blue water, re\uFB02ecting the low\
    \ levels of irrigation in the region."
  5: No relevant information
  8: Trade liberalization was found to facilitate buffering of food production declines
    via international imports.
  11: The paper quantifies evolutions in water and food systems of southern Africa
    as linked to international trade, and observes the impacts of trade liberalization
    and climate extremes in Virtual Water Trade (VWT) dynamics.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: No relevant information
  3: Agricultural GDP (agriculture's share of gross domestic product).
  4: No relevant information
  5: No relevant information
  7: Statistically significant relationships identified between rainfall and agricultural
    GDP in Namibia and Zimbabwe.
  8: Regional GDP grew rapidly from 2003 and the region's GDP per capita has more
    than doubled in 26 years (until 2015).
Quantitative material:
  1: No relevant information
  5: Extra-regional food trade, between southern Africa and the RoW, is an order of
    magnitude larger than regional trade
  6: Quantitative data includes virtual water flows (e.g., 2.5 km3 from the USA and
    1.8 km3 from Argentina), maize trade-induced water savings, and statistical significance
    in the relationship between PDSI and maize VWC in specific cases.
  7: R2 values provided for relationships between climate variables (PDSI, rainfall)
    and economic outcomes (agricultural GDP, maize yield).
  8: In 1992, net imports from RoW (rest of the world) accounted for up to 350% of
    domestic production (figure 5).
  11: Significant impacts of severe extreme events are observed on yield, water use,
    trade and WS. Water-efficient post-drought trade has also been used to compensate
    some economic losses.
