Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change is identified as a driver of water vulnerability, alongside land-use
    changes and water withdrawal (especially in agriculture).
  2: Increased temperatures leading to altered precipitation patterns (more extremes),
    droughts and heat waves, impacting critical infrastructure and energy production.
  7: Projected changes in temperature and precipitation patterns under different RCP
    scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5).
  11: Changes in the maximum length of dry spells, particularly in summer. Lengthening
    of consecutive dry days (CDD) in spring and autumn. Changes in extreme precipitation
    events.
  13: 'Increased greenhouse gas emissions leading to different Representative Concentration
    Pathways (RCPs): 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5.'
  15: Exacerbation of heat waves and droughts over Italy in the next decades under
    different socio-economic pathways.
Highlights:
  1: Drought conditions and extreme precipitations will likely exacerbate in the coming
    decades without mitigation (RCP 8.5). Such conditions will be less critical if
    partial mitigation actions will be undertaken (RCP4.5) and are expected to be
    significantly reduced with decarbonization policies (RCP 2.6).
  7: The study projects varying degrees of temperature and precipitation changes in
    Italy depending on the RCP scenario. Under RCP 8.5, significant temperature increases
    are projected across all seasons. Precipitation changes are also projected, varying
    seasonally and across different RCPs.
  11: The maximum length of dry spells is expected to grow significantly, above all
    in summer in Southern Italy under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. A significant increase
    in CDD is expected over much of Italy during the summer. Increasing drought conditions
    in spring may seriously impact the agricultural sector.
  13: Extreme precipitation events are likely to increase, with intensities depending
    on the region, season, and RCP scenario. No significant change is expected under
    RCP 2.6. Exacerbation of precipitation anomalies is likely in RCP 4.5 and RCP
    8.5.
  15: Exacerbation of heat waves and droughts over Italy in the next decades under
    different socio-economic pathways.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis is based on high-resolution Euro-CORDEX models (12km resolution) under
    three RCPs (8.5, 4.5, 2.6) comparing ensemble mean values for base-line (1971-2000)
    with short- (2021-2050), medium- (2041-2070) and long-term (2071-2100).
  2: The study aims to update climate change projections focused on the rainfall regime
    in Italy, using regional climate model simulations from the COordinated Regional
    climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX), to cope with the climate impacts and
    strengthen resilience and the adaptive capacity of the socio, economic and environmental
    sectors. It considers long lifetimes of critical infrastructures.
  7: Uses Euro-CORDEX ensemble models to compute temperature and precipitation anomalies
    under different RCP configurations. The analysis is based on comparing projected
    future climate conditions (2021-2050, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100) with a reference
    period (1971-2000).
  11: The analysis uses the WMO ETCCDI index R99PTOT to assess changes in extreme
    precipitations. Anomalies are estimated by computing the differences between future
    and reference R99PTOT values in the short-, medium-, and long-term.
  13: The analysis uses climate models to project precipitation anomalies for future
    periods (2041-2070 and 2071-2100) under different RCP scenarios.
  15: Climate model simulations and data preprocessing to analyze heat waves and droughts.
    Results are applicable to the next decades.
More Notes:
  1: Focuses on future precipitation scenarios and climate extremes (droughts and
    floods) over Italy.
  7: The paper focuses on climate projections and does not directly assess macroeconomic
    or fiscal impacts. The provided data would need to be integrated with economic
    models to estimate these impacts. The maps provide spatially disaggregated information
    that could be useful for regional assessments.
  11: The MMM seasonal reconstructions are wetter than the corresponding E-OBS scenarios
    over Southern Italy, with overestimations that reach up to 100%.
  15: The author, Paola Faggian, is also the author of the study identified in reference
    16, which may contain more specific information if acquired.

  8: This page primarily focuses on projected climate anomalies (temperature and precipitation)
    and does not provide specific information about macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes,
    economic costs/benefits, or adaptation measures at a national level. The page's
    focus is on presenting climate model projections, not economic modeling or cost-benefit
    analysis.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Mentions potential for hundreds of millions of people to suffer from water shortages
    and coastal flooding.
  2: Potential damage to critical infrastructures, impact on hydropower generation,
    reduced efficiency of thermoelectric power generation, failure of underground
    cable joints, increased energy costs, challenges to energy supply security, and
    potential hindrance to sustainable economic growth.

  11: Potential impact on the agricultural sector due to increasing drought conditions

    not directly on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
