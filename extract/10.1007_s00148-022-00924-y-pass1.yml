Drivers of Risk:
  2: Global warming (higher temperatures).
  3: Global warming (persistent increases in temperature).
  5: Increasing temperatures (global warming)
  7: Increasing temperatures (global warming), economic downturns depressing agricultural
    production, increased migration costs
  9: Increasing Temperatures
  12: Global warming (indicated by increasing temperatures). Urbanization rate.
  13: Global warming, as measured by mean temperature.
  18: Global warming and urbanization
  21: "\u2206 Temperature (\u2206 T), \u2206 Urbanization (\u2206 U)"
  22: Increase in temperature (global warming)
  23: Temperature changes (short-run and long-run).
  24: "Global warming (temperature changes \u2206T) and urbanization (\u2206U)."
  31: Initial temperature; Initial urbanization; Initial GDP p.c.; Initial employment
    in agriculture; Initial urban bias; Cluster (poor conditions)
  33: Temperature changes (global warming)
  34: Global warming, increasing temperatures, other weather and climate phenomena
    (heat waves, droughts, flood events), adverse initial conditions (lower levels
    of adaptive capability and higher levels of vulnerability to climate change)
Highlights:
  2: Higher temperatures correlate with higher urbanization rates in the long run,
    especially in poorer, agriculture-dependent countries with an urban bias and in
    initially non-urban countries in hotter climate zones.
  3: "Higher temperatures are related to higher urbanization rates (and thus rural\u2013\
    urban migration) in the long run."
  5: Global warming influences the relative attractiveness of rural and urban areas,
    affecting internal migration and urbanization patterns.
  7: Increasing temperatures may be related to lower levels of urbanization (H2).
    Increasing temperatures are related to urbanization more strongly in the long
    than in the short run (H3).
  9: The relationship between increasing temperatures and urbanization is stronger
    in countries with a larger agricultural sector and in countries with a more pronounced
    urban bias.
  12: Rapid urbanization and global warming have occurred since the 1950s.
  13: Temperature data shows significant cross-sectional dependence, which requires
    the use of econometric methods robust to cross-sectional dependence.
  14: The data series for urbanization and temperature are non-stationary in levels
    but become stationary after first-differencing, showing evidence of I(1) behavior.
  18: The table presents results for different specifications (1-7) with varying sets
    of controls and fixed effects, suggesting an attempt to assess the robustness
    of the findings.
  21: Temperature and urbanization changes have statistically significant coefficients.
  22: Increasing temperatures are linked to more urbanization in the long run. The
    long-run association is more pronounced than the short-run association.
  23: Higher temperatures are associated with less urbanization in the short run,
    but more urbanization in the long run.
  24: "Temperature changes (\u2206T) and urbanization (\u2206U) have a statistically\
    \ significant negative association with the unspecified outcome 'l' across different\
    \ model specifications."
  31: Initial temperature, Initial urbanization, Initial GDP p.c., Initial employment
    in agriculture, Initial urban bias, and Cluster have statistically significant
    effects on urbanization.
  33: There is a long-run positive relationship between warming and urbanization.
  34: "Increasing temperatures may fuel urbanization to a dangerous extent in countries\
    \ that lack the capacity to absorb rural\u2013urban migration. A substantial reduction\
    \ of greenhouse gas emissions ought to reduce the overall impact of global warming\
    \ on human life, also with respect to its unhealthy interaction with urbanization.\
    \ To reduce the rural push due to increasing temperatures, the vulnerability of\
    \ rural areas to global warming should be lowered."
Methodology:
  2: Panel vector error correction models; analyzes long-run and short-term relationships.
  3: Country-level panel data analysis (118 countries, 1960-2016) linking temperature
    to urbanization rates.
  5: Applies a push-pull framework of internal migration based on Lee (1966)
  7: Theoretical discussion proposing hypotheses about the relationship between temperature
    increases and urbanization levels.
  9: Panel data analysis using a sample of 118 countries from 1960-2016. The dataset
    needs to be fully balanced.
  12: We average all weather data on temperature for a specific country and year of
    interest, correcting for differences in grid sizes and elevation between weather
    stations within the same grid.
  13: Uses the bias-adjusted LM test of Pesaran et al. (2008) and the test for weak
    cross-sectional dependence of Pesaran (2015) to assess cross-sectional dependence
    in temperature and urbanization data.
  14: Panel unit root tests developed by Pesaran (2007), Herwartz and Siedenburg (2008),
    and Demetrescu and Hanck (2012) are used to test for unit roots in urbanization
    and temperature data. Tests for panel cointegration are also used. These tests
    are robust to cross-sectional dependence and serial correlation; the latter two
    are also robust to heteroskedasticity.
  18: Fixed effects regression models are used with different specifications, including
    controls for education, democracy, and dependency. Driscoll-Kray standard errors
    are used in some specifications. The models include country-fixed effects, time-fixed
    effects, and regional fixed effects. Different specifications include interactions
    between time-fixed effects and low-income countries and between regional fixed
    effects and low-income countries.
  21: Dynamic fixed-effects and OLS estimations are used to analyze short-run and
    long-run impacts. The analysis includes control variables like population size,
    GDP p.c. (per capita), democracy, and education.
  22: Regression analysis (specifically, cointegration analysis) of the relationship
    between temperature and urbanization over time. They address omitted variable
    bias using the Oster (2019) method to assess selection on unobservables. The model
    is dynamically stable with respect to the cointegration relationship.
  23: The study uses a baseline model with robustness checks including additional
    controls, alternative variable measurements, and lagged variables. The analysis
    considers short-run and long-run effects.
  24: Dynamic fixed-effects regression models are used to analyze the relationship
    between temperature changes, urbanization, and the outcome 'l'. Different model
    specifications include controls for population size, GDP per capita, education,
    and various urbanization measures.
  29: The analysis is performed using a k-means cluster analysis to group countries
    by initial conditions like urbanization, temperature, economic development, agricultural
    employment, and urban bias, and a series of panel vector error correction models
    is used to examine the interaction between these variables and temperature on
    urbanization changes.
  31: Dynamic panel-data analysis using a 2-step GMM system estimator; includes time
    and country-fixed effects; considers short-run and long-run effects; controls
    for population size, GDP p.c., democracy, and other factors.
  33: Dynamic fixed-effects estimates are reported, with error correction included.
    The model controls for population size, GDP per capita, and democracy. Driscoll-Kraay
    standard errors are used.
  34: Empirical analysis of the relationship between increasing temperatures and urbanization,
    considering other agro-climatic variables as robustness checks.
More Notes:
  2: The paper suggests that warming contributes to losses in agricultural productivity
    and pro-urban shifts in public goods provision. The relationship between temperature
    and urbanization is partly mediated through these channels (rural push and urban
    pull).
  3: The relationship between global warming and urbanization is more pronounced in
    countries with economic and institutional underdevelopment and strong dependence
    on agriculture. The relationship matters more to initially non-urban countries
    in hotter climate zones. Global warming promotes migration by contributing to
    poorer rural conditions (e.g., affecting agricultural production) and increased
    attractiveness of urban centers.
  5: The paper focuses on the relationship between global warming and urbanization
    through the channels of agriculture and the provision of public goods.
  7: The paper argues that temperature increases can disincentivize rural-urban migration
    by increasing migration costs and worsening liquidity constraints. The effect
    of temperature on migration is expected to be more pronounced in the long run
    due to cumulative socio-economic effects.
  9: The study excludes very small island countries, countries that gained independence
    in the 1980s and 1990s, and city-states.
  12: The sample consists of unspecified countries. The study period is 1960-2016.
    The relationship between urbanization and temperature rise is mentioned, but no
    further analysis of their interaction or impact is provided on this page.
  13: The paper explores the relationship between global warming and urbanization,
    and the cross-sectional dependence identified is important for the subsequent
    empirical analysis using econometric methods.
  18: The dependent variable is not explicitly mentioned.
  21: The table shows estimates from several regression models (1, 2, 3), with different
    specifications. The meaning of FWNCD is not defined on this page.
  22: The association between temperature and urbanization becomes less pronounced
    (though remains statistically significant) when additional controls are added
    to the model, suggesting possible omitted variable bias or that covariates mediate
    the relationship.
  23: The study uses alternative measures of temperature (weighted by population size
    or agricultural land) and urbanization (logged urbanization rate, logged total
    urban population) for robustness.
  24: "The dependent variable 'l' is not clearly defined on this page. There are nine\
    \ different specifications, varying in the urbanization measure used. The table\
    \ header mentions 'Climate datMeasurSamShorShor\u2211 \u2206 U\u2211 \u2206 TLong-rErTFWNDynamic\
    \ fixp.c.; tiv*' but the definitions of these columns are not apparent from the\
    \ page alone."
  31: The effects are moderated by urbanization, and the table shows the coefficients
    when urbanization is considered as a moderator.
  33: The analysis considers cross-sectional dependence, non-stationarity, and cointegration.
    The impact of temperature changes is moderated by initial conditions (1=poor starting
    conditions). Mediators considered are value added in agriculture and public goods
    provision equity.
  34: "The paper suggests that the relationship between global warming and urbanization\
    \ is particularly strong in comparatively poorer economies that may lack the economic\
    \ and institutional resources to adequately adapt. The positive relationship between\
    \ temperature and urbanization partly reflects how global warming increases the\
    \ rural push (by impairing agriculture) and the urban pull (via an increased demand\
    \ for public goods that are more likely to be supplied in the urban centers),\
    \ thus incentivizing rural\u2013urban migration especially in the long run."
