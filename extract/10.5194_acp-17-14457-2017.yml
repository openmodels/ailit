Drivers of Risk:
  1: Daily global mean temperature, daily indices of synoptic-scale meteorology (T,
    Q, and Z), and spatiotemporally averaged soil moisture (SM).
  2: Changes in sensible and latent heat fluxes impact equivalent potential temperature;
    land cover change and soil moisture modification due to irrigation impact surface
    energy partitioning.
  3: "High summertime temperatures (Te and \u03B8e), soil moisture, land cover changes,\
    \ land management, and large-scale climate modes (e.g., Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation)\
    \ and aerosol radiative forcing."
  4: Variability in synoptic-scale circulation (e.g., anticyclonic conditions) and
    large-scale advection of static energy are identified as drivers.
  5: "Synoptic-scale meteorology and soil moisture are predictors for maximum and\
    \ minimum \u03B8e."
  7: "Soil moisture, temperature, latitude, and longitude are used as predictors for\
    \ daily maximum and minimum equivalent potential temperature (\u03B8e)."
  8: The primary focus is on the predictive capability of models regarding maximum
    and minimum potential temperature variations.
  9: Soil moisture (SM) influences surface energy partitioning and near-surface temperature
    (T) and specific humidity (q) regimes, and static energy.
  10: "Extreme maximum equivalent potential temperature (\u03B8e), specifically exceedance\
    \ of 347K, is a key driver. Soil moisture (SM) is identified as a predictor."
  11: "The study identifies soil moisture (SM) as a key driver impacting near-surface\
    \ temperature (T) and specific humidity (q), particularly during daytime under\
    \ conditions of positive net radiation. Variability in minimum and maximum \u03B8\
    e over eastern North America is also a focus."
  12: "Extreme minimum and maximum \u03B8e (near-surface static energy) are drivers\
    \ of risk."
Evaluation overview:
  1: Heat-related excess mortality and morbidity.
  2: Near-surface static energy variability is being evaluated.
  3: "The study focuses on understanding and predicting variations in near-surface\
    \ static energy (\u03B8e) and its relationship to extreme heat events and warming\
    \ holes."
  5: "Daily maximum and minimum equivalent potential temperature (\u03B8e) are used\
    \ as predictands in downscaling models."
  7: No relevant information
  8: "The page evaluates the performance of different downscaling models for predicting\
    \ daily maximum and minimum potential temperatures (\u03B8e) in the United States."
  9: No relevant information
  10: No relevant information
  11: "This paper focuses on evaluating the model performance in predicting near-surface\
    \ static energy (\u03B8e), which is relevant to heatwave analysis and has direct\
    \ applications to climate change impact analyses such as human heat stress."
  12: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: "ANNs outperform linear models, SM is key in dictating the partitioning of net\
    \ radiation into sensible and latent heat, and dictating trends in near-surface\
    \ T and \u03B8e."
  2: The total static energy of the near-surface atmosphere has significantly increased
    since the 1970s due to increases in net radiation and temperature-associated increases
    in specific humidity.
  3: "The study identifies warming holes along the border of Iowa, Nebraska, and South\
    \ Dakota, and centered on Mississippi and Alabama, attributing the lack of warming\
    \ to changing land-surface characteristics and enhanced soil moisture availability.\
    \ The eastern USA is characterized by high summertime Te (and \u03B8e), and in\
    \ situ data have indicated trends in Te exceed those in T alone."
  5: "MO and IA exhibit anomalously high mean maximum \u03B8e compared with grid cells\
    \ at the same latitudes, reflecting the advection of air with high T and q from\
    \ the south by the Great Plains low-level jet and the presence of abundant soil\
    \ moisture."
  7: Linear models (MLR) perform the worst. All model architectures exhibit high correlation
    coefficients (r>0.8) with independent data over most of the domain.
  8: Models using artificial neural networks with three hidden layers show strong
    correlation with observed temperature data, reflected in closely clustered scatter
    plot points around a 1:1 reference line.
  9: Including soil moisture in the ANN model (ANN-HL3-SM) enhances model performance.
    Soil moisture plays a key role in dictating the surface energy balance and in
    the suppression of daily maximum temperature while increasing maximum static energy.
  10: "Including soil moisture (SM) as a predictor in the ANN model enhances HR in\
    \ regions with high variance in extreme \u03B8e without a significant increase\
    \ in FAR. All model forms performed worst over eastern TX and South Carolina (SC)."
  11: "Increased model complexity enhances the skill of model predictions of \u03B8\
    e. Soil moisture directly impacts near-surface T and q during the daytime. ANN\
    \ models outperform those that do not permit interaction of the predictor variables.\
    \ More complex models with multiple hidden layers are better able to capture the\
    \ day-to-day variability in \u03B8e, particularly in regions with high variability."
  12: "ANN-HL3-SM models exhibit relatively high skill in predicting the occurrence\
    \ of extreme minimum and maximum \u03B8e, outperforming simpler models. Soil moisture\
    \ (SM) plays a key role in dictating the presence and intensity of warming holes."
Methodology:
  1: "Developed non-linear statistical models (Artificial Neural Networks - ANNs)\
    \ for summertime daily maximum and minimum equivalent potential temperature (\u03B8\
    e) over the eastern USA."
  2: Nonlinear (machine learning) models are applied to predictors including daily
    global mean temperature, synoptic scale conditions (PCA of upper-air variables),
    and soil moisture.
  3: "The study uses MERRA-2 reanalysis data for summer days (June, July, and August)\
    \ during 1980\u20132015 over the eastern USA. It employs globally averaged daily\
    \ mean air temperature and indices of synoptic-scale meteorology (T850, q850,\
    \ Z500) converted to z-scores and subjected to rotated PCA."
  4: The study uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify synoptic modes
    of variability based on spatial fields of T850, q850 and Z500 sampled once per
    day at 20:00 UTC. 15 components are retained after Varimax rotation. It also uses
    a 90-day running mean of soil moisture (SM) integrated over 3x3 grid cells as
    a predictor.
  5: "Daily minimum and maximum \u03B8e are derived using an equation applied to hourly\
    \ T at 2m, q at 2m, and surface pressure (P). The domain is truncated to accommodate\
    \ spatial averaging for the soil moisture predictor. PCA is used to define synoptic\
    \ modes of variability."
  7: The study uses multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks
    (ANN) with varying hidden layers (0, 1, and 3) to predict daily maximum and minimum
    equivalent potential temperature. Models are trained on 70% of the data, validated
    on 15%, and independently evaluated on the remaining 15%. Soil moisture is considered
    as a predictor in some models, using either total columnar soil moisture (PRMC)
    or surface soil moisture (WGETTOP).
  8: The analysis employs different predictive models, including multiple linear regression
    and various configurations of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with varying numbers
    of hidden layers and inclusion/exclusion of soil moisture data.
  9: "The study uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to model daily maximum and\
    \ minimum static energy (\u03B8e) using various predictors, including an index\
    \ of global temperatures and soil moisture (SM). The analysis focuses on the central\
    \ US. Models are evaluated by comparing predicted and observed values using metrics\
    \ like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and correlation (r)."
  10: "Multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models\
    \ are used to predict the occurrence of extreme maximum \u03B8e. The ANN models\
    \ include one with and one without soil moisture (SM) as a predictor. The analysis\
    \ is based on MERRA-2 reanalysis data. Models are evaluated based on hit rate\
    \ (HR) and false alarm rate (FAR)."
  11: "The study uses a hierarchy of statistical models (ANN and MLR) with increasing\
    \ complexity to predict daily minimum and maximum \u03B8e using variables commonly\
    \ available from reanalyses and climate models. The analysis is applied to reanalysis\
    \ data over the eastern USA."
  12: "Multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models\
    \ with three hidden layers, with and without soil moisture (SM) as a predictor,\
    \ are used to predict extreme minimum and maximum \u03B8e. Results are applicable\
    \ to the central and eastern USA."
More Notes:
  1: "The models are particularly marked in regions with high variability in minimum\
    \ and maximum \u03B8e."
  5: The study uses MERRA-2 reanalysis data. The evaluation of MERRA-2 SM is focused
    on agricultural locations due to limited direct measurements of SM.
  7: "The study domain is within 97.5\xB0\u2013 65\xB0W, 25\xB0\u201350\xB0N and the\
    \ study period is JJA, 1980\u20132015."
  9: "The weights on the index of global temperatures are large in land grid cells\
    \ close to the Gulf of Mexico and around the Great Lakes. Models may underestimate\
    \ the total variance in maximum \u03B8e leading to underestimation of extreme\
    \ maximum \u03B8e."
  10: "False alarm rates for predicting extreme maximum \u03B8e> 347K are generally\
    \ low (below 0.25 for over 94% of grid cells for the ANN-HL3-SM model). Models\
    \ miss a substantial fraction of extreme \u03B8e events, even the best performing\
    \ ANN (ANN-HL3-SM) exhibits a modal grid-cell HR of 0.6-0.7."
  12: "The importance of the predictors varies spatially. The framework has greater\
    \ skill for maximum \u03B8e than minimum \u03B8e. Models including SM have a smaller\
    \ RMSE than the temporal variability of \u03B8e."
Quantitative material:
  1: "Median hit rate for maximum \u03B8e > 347 K is > 0.60, while the median false\
    \ alarm rate is \u22480.08."
  3: Up to 60% of the variance of summer temperatures in Mississippi and Alabama has
    been ascribed to soil moisture and cloud cover.
  4: "MERRA-2 SM exhibits an unbiased root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.05 m3m\u2212\
    3."
  5: "Variance of daily maximum \u03B8e is largest over IA and southern MN, while\
    \ the variance of minimum \u03B8e is greatest over IL."
  7: "The table shows root mean square error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient\
    \ (r) for various models predicting daily maximum and minimum equivalent potential\
    \ temperature. For example, MLR has RMSE of 4.05 K and r of 0.849 for maximum\
    \ \u03B8e, while ANN-HL3-TOP has RMSE of 3.97 K and r of 0.856 for maximum \u03B8\
    e."
  8: Quantitative results include Pearson correlation and mean root mean square error
    (RMSE) values for model predictions compared to observed data.
  9: "92% of grid cells for ANN-HL3-SM exhibit RMSE < 5K for maximum \u03B8e and 91%\
    \ exhibit RMSE < 5K for minimum \u03B8e. Over two-thirds of all grid cells (1332\
    \ of 1962) exhibit lower RMSE in the ANN model with three hidden layers and including\
    \ SM (i.e., ANN-HL3-SM) than in any of the other models (e.g., MLR). RMSE for\
    \ maximum \u03B8e is increased in models excluding SM in all grid cells within\
    \ MO, and all but one grid cell each in IA and IL."
  10: "Mean Hit Rate (HR) values for predicting extreme maximum \u03B8e> 347K are\
    \ 59% for the linear model (MLR), 60% for the ANN with soil moisture (ANN-HL3-SM),\
    \ and 56% for the ANN without soil moisture (ANN-HL3)."
  11: "Domain-averaged RMSE for minimum and maximum \u03B8e is smallest in the most\
    \ complex models (ANN-HL3-SM, RMSE < 4 and < 4.3K, respectively, cf. mean maximum\
    \ \u03B8e \u2248 333K and mean minimum \u03B8e \u2248 321K). Correlation coefficients\
    \ exceed 0.8 for 84% of grid cells for ANN-HL3-SM applied to maximum \u03B8e and\
    \ 81% for minimum \u03B8e. 92% of grid cells for ANN-HL3-SM exhibit a RMSE < 5K\
    \ for maximum \u03B8e and 91% for minimum \u03B8e."
  12: "The ANN-HL3-SM model has a domain-averaged median hit rate for maximum \u03B8\
    e > 347K that is > 0.60, while the median FAR is \u22480.08."
