Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Demographic and economic projections developed in the context of the Intergovernmental\
    \ Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Shared Socioeconomic Pathways."
  4: Different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios projecting different
    economic growth and poverty reduction trajectories; variations in policy efforts
    influencing development.
  5: Different projections of human capital dynamics and labor productivity are based
    on SSP-specific human capital projections.
  6: Different SSP scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) which implicitly incorporate
    varying levels of climate change, mitigation efforts, and socioeconomic development
    pathways impacting poverty.
Highlights:
  1: "The differences implied by different global scenarios span worldwide poverty\
    \ rates ranging from 4.5% to almost 6% by the end of our projection period; The\
    \ largest differences in poverty headcount and poverty rates across scenarios\
    \ appear for Sub-Saharan Africa, where the projections for the most optimistic\
    \ scenario imply over 300 million individuals living in extreme poverty in 2030;\
    \ fulfilling the \uFB01rst goal of the SDGs will be difficult unless further development\
    \ policy efforts are enacted."
  4: Fulfilling the first SDG is difficult unless further development policy efforts
    are enacted; SSP5 (most optimistic poverty reduction scenario) only increases
    the number of countries achieving poverty eradication by 2030 by three (Brazil,
    Burkina Faso, Ecuador) compared to SSP2; poverty reduction in SSP5 occurs mostly
    in countries with high poverty headcount rates at the moment.
  5: The projections indicate trends towards a more equal distribution of average
    income per capita in SSP1, SSP2, and SSP5, but increased income inequality between
    countries in SSP3 and SSP4.
  6: The analysis estimates poverty headcounts and rates by continent and globally
    for 2030 under five different SSP scenarios. Africa has the highest poverty headcount
    and rate across all scenarios, while Asia has the lowest poverty rate. SSP3 generally
    projects the highest poverty levels, while SSP1 projects the lowest.
Methodology:
  1: "The model combines country-speci\uFB01c historical estimates of the distribution\
    \ of income, using Beta\u2013Lorenz curves, with projections of population changes\
    \ by age and education attainment level, as well as GDP projections to provide\
    \ the \uFB01rst set of internally consistent poverty projections for all countries\
    \ of the world."
  4: Comparison of poverty scenarios (SSP2, SSP4, SSP5) to assess progress towards
    poverty eradication by 2030, with the SSPs providing long-run average income projections.
    Analysis based on economic growth projections emphasizing human capital accumulation
    through formal education.
  5: The analysis uses SSP (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway) scenarios combined with
    country-specific GDP forecasts to project average income per capita and poverty
    headcounts.
  6: "The paper estimates country-specific Beta\u2013Lorenz curves to estimate poverty\
    \ headcount ratios. The Beta-Lorenz curve models the cumulative share in total\
    \ income at the cumulative population."
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on poverty projections up to 2030 using demographic and economic
    projections from the IPCC's Shared Socioeconomic Pathways.
  4: Poverty figures should not be considered forecasts, but projections providing
    benchmarks to understand potential poverty changes under different narratives
    and inform policy actions.
  6: The figure and the adjacent text suggest that energy intensity and per capita
    energy consumption are drivers or correlated with the outcomes considered.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Poverty rates worldwide
  4: Poverty rates, measured as the share of extreme poor population, used as a proxy
    for achieving the first SDG.
  6: Poverty headcount and poverty rate by continent under different SSP scenarios.
Quantitative material:
  1: Worldwide poverty rates ranging from 4.5% (around 375 million persons) to almost
    6% (over 500 million persons) by the end of our projection period (2030).
  4: SSP4 projects approximately 26% poverty rate in 2030 for the African continent,
    while SSP5 projects approximately 20%.
  5: Quantitative projections of poverty headcounts are provided using SSP scenarios,
    showing changes in poverty levels across countries for 2017 and 2030.
  6: Table 1 provides quantitative data on poverty headcount (in millions) and poverty
    rate (in parenthesis) for Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South
    America, and the World under SSP1, SSP2, SSP3, SSP4, and SSP5 scenarios for the
    year 2030.
