Drivers of Risk:
  1: "Oceanic-atmospheric variations, climate change, rising sea levels, altered wave\
    \ patterns, extreme events (high-intensity waves and storm surges), El Ni\xF1\
    o and La Ni\xF1a."
  9: Variations in wave systems and their impact on coastal flooding and erosion.
  11: "Rising sea surface temperatures increasing tropical and extratropical storms,\
    \ leading to extreme wave events; Warm-core tropical cyclones and cold-core extratropical\
    \ cyclones; Changes in seabed altering wave angles; Human interventions along\
    \ the coast; La Ni\xF1a events leading to larger erosion; Increased precipitation\
    \ over the Andes during El Ni\xF1o events contributing to flooding risks."
  13: Changes in Tropical Pacific Ocean temperature and wave patterns could lead to
    coastal erosion and influence coastal dynamics.
  20: Coastal erosion worsened by tropical cyclones, rising sea levels, and extreme
    events.
  24: Oceanic and atmospheric variations, population growth in low-lying coastal areas,
    extreme events (storms, intense waves), rapid sea-level rise, particularly under
    the RCP8.5 emissions scenario, cyclonic tides, changes in wave energy and direction.
  25: Increasing frequency of simultaneous extreme events involving precipitation
    and meteorological tides under the RCP8.5 scenario, ENSO climate variations affecting
    wind patterns and storm frequency, and changes in the Caribbean Low-Level Jet
    impacting sea levels and cyclonic surges.
  26: Climate change (including internal climate variability from ENSO, SAM, AMO,
    and PDO cycles), human activities (urbanization, construction of coastal protection
    and infrastructure, sand extraction), and oceanic-atmospheric variations on regional
    coastal climate.
Highlights:
  1: Coastal erosion poses a growing challenge for Latin American coastal communities,
    causing significant economic losses.
  9: Heightened frequency of extreme wave events anticipated by the end of the century
    under RCP8.5, affecting coastal erosion and wave height.
  11: Coastal regions in Central and South America are vulnerable to climate change
    and sea-level rise, specifically low elevation coastal zones (LECZ). Population
    projections in these zones suggest an increased number of people at risk.
  13: Projected changes in wave patterns could lead to new beach erosion and accretion
    dynamics.
  20: Coastal retreat exacerbates infrastructure exposure and impacts tourism income
    significantly in Chile and Brazil.
  24: Extreme events are projected to increase, exacerbating coastal erosion, with
    impacts varying across different regions of Latin America.
  25: "Significant effects of El Ni\xF1o and La Ni\xF1a on weather patterns, erosion,\
    \ and sedimentation in Latin American coastal regions."
  26: There is an urgent need to promote further research that addresses the physical
    impacts on coastal morphology and provides insights into potential socio-economic
    impacts on populations.
Methodology:
  1: Systematic review of 130 research papers.
  9: Analysis of wave systems separately to understand how climate change influences
    wave systems and impacts on coastal areas.
  11: Population projections related to sea level rise and extreme weather events
    are presented, but the methodology for calculating the impact on macroeconomic
    or fiscal outcomes is not detailed.
  13: No relevant information
  24: Uses General Circulation Models (GCMs) for past and future climate projections,
    acknowledges limitations in resolution and simplification. Employs downscaling
    techniques due to lack of detailed local marine dynamics data.
  25: Use of advanced technology, including drones and remote sensors, for enhancing
    data collection and accuracy of coastal studies in Latin America.
More Notes:
  9: Wave systems' variations due to climate patterns like SAM and ENSO impact coastal
    geomorphology, highlighting the dynamic risk posed to coastal areas.
  11: The impact of coastal erosion is stronger on the westward windward side of coastlines.
    Cities with high population densities are at greater risk.
  13: No relevant information
  24: Lack of detailed data and varying levels of expertise in Latin American countries
    pose challenges for downscaling techniques.
  25: Focus on using technology to aid in risk assessment and adaptation planning
    against climate change impacts in vulnerable coastal areas.
  26: The scarcity of data on oceanic-atmospheric variations on the regional coastal
    climate in continental Latin America hinders a precise understanding of their
    overall impact and the projection of reliable future scenarios.
