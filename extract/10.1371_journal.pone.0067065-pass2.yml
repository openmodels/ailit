Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sustained hotter, drier conditions most likely associated with reductions in
    forage quality, reduced nitrogen availability in grasslands.
  4: Climate variability affecting forage quality and bison weight gain.
  6: "Warming, specifically a 1\xB0C warming."
Highlights:
  1: Long-term effects of higher temperatures are likely to accrue over time as nitrogen
    availability in grasslands is reduced and forage quality declines, leading to
    potential economic consequences for cattle production.
  4: The study suggests that climate has a significant impact on forage quality and
    subsequently, bison weight gain.
  6: Warming can lead to significant economic costs to cattle producers.
Methodology:
  1: Analysis of a dataset of over a quarter million bison weights distributed across
    22 US herds, analyzing patterns of bison body mass with respect to differences
    in geographic patterns of climate and interannual variation in climate.
  4: Relationships between climate, forage quality, and bison mass are statistically
    analyzed.
  6: Projecting weight gain reductions observed in bison onto cattle and scaling up
    by the cattle population size.
More Notes:
  1: The relationships observed for bison are assumed to be general for cattle to
    estimate the economic impact.
  4: Study examines the relationship between climate factors such as temperature and
    precipitation on bison mass, which may indirectly relate to broader ecological
    impacts linking to macro-fiscal effects, but no direct macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes are discussed.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Potential economic consequences of higher temperatures due to decreased weight
    gain in US cattle could be on the order of US$1B per 1uC increase in temperature.
  4: No relevant information
  6: Economic costs to US cattle producers.
Quantitative material:
  1: US$1B per 1uC increase in temperature (potential economic consequences of higher
    temperatures due to decreased weight gain in US cattle).
  4: No relevant information
  6: "US$1 billion cost to US cattle producers for 1\xB0C warming, either through\
    \ direct reductions in weight gain or costs of dietary supplement."
