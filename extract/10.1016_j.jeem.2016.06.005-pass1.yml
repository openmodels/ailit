Drivers of Risk:
  7: Contemporaneous temperature and precipitation of origin countries; Agricultural
    dependence of origin countries.
  8: Temperature increases, agricultural dependence
  9: Temperature effects on migration flows, with agriculture-dependent countries
    experiencing significant impacts.
  11: Cereal yield (agricultural productivity), temperature, and precipitation are
    drivers of outmigration.
  12: Temperature variations, Precipitation
  13: Temperature variations impact outmigration from agriculture-dependent countries;
    precipitation may also play a role.
  14: Climate-induced international migration, especially as it affects agriculture-dependent
    countries
  16: Wage differentials between the fictitious country and the rest of the world,
    non-pecuniary utilities, and migration costs.
  18: Climate change (adverse changes in temperature and precipitation) impacting
    migration.
  28: Interaction between temperature and agricultural dependence.
  29: Temperature, Precipitation, and their interaction with Agriculture, along with
    lagged GDP per capita of origin and destination countries.
  30: Log of origin cereal yields (as a proxy for agricultural productivity, potentially
    affected by climate change).
  32: Weather anomalies and climate impacts, such as rainfall deficits, were found
    to influence migration.
  34: The country groupings are based on the share of agriculture value added in GDP,
    which acts as a proxy for vulnerability to climate-related shocks affecting agriculture.
    Monthly mean temperature (Degree Celsius); Monthly total precipitation (Millimeters)
  35: Temperature and precipitation.
Highlights:
  7: Adverse climate change triggers more outmigration for agriculture-dependent countries.
    For non-agricultural countries, changes in climate do not significantly trigger
    outmigration.
  8: Temperature increases in agricultural-dependent countries are associated with
    increased outmigration. Lagged temperature effects suggest that migration may
    take time to stimulate.
  9: Temperature effects on migration are positive and significant across various
    model specifications and country definitions.
  11: Cereal yields are negatively associated with outmigration only in the top 25%
    agricultural countries.
  12: The relationship between temperature and cereal yields is less significant when
    using coarse country-level data. The FE-2SLS estimates could be biased if weather
    affects migration through channels other than cereal yield. Results are robust
    to various model specifications.
  13: Significant climate-induced migration occurs from agriculture-dependent countries,
    affecting existing migration routes; results are robust to alternative specifications.
  14: Agriculture is an important factor influencing climate-induced international
    migration. Agricultural adaptation may reduce incentives to migrate. Diversifying
    livelihoods may also reduce migration.
  16: Equilibrium population levels depend on wage differences, non-pecuniary utilities,
    and migration costs; showing how economic conditions influence migration.
  18: Adverse climate change can induce a decline in population or outmigration from
    a country, especially for agriculture-dependent countries. If amenities are not
    adversely affected by climate change, then for non-agricultural countries, changes
    in climate would not trigger any outmigration.
  28: Coefficients indicating significance of temperature and agricultural dependence
    interaction under various robustness checks.
  29: The interaction between temperature and agriculture has a statistically significant
    positive effect on migration routes to the most popular destination countries
    (column 4).
  30: In Panel A, FE-OLS, the effect of log of origin cereal yields on outmigration
    is negative and statistically significant only in column (2) and (4), suggesting
    that decreased cereal yields increase outmigration in countries with a relatively
    high dependence on agriculture. In Panel B, FE-2SLS, the effect of log of origin
    cereal yields on outmigration is negative and statistically significant only in
    column (4) (most agriculture-dependent countries).
  32: Weather anomalies can increase internal and international migration through
    both amenity and economic geography channels.
  34: The most agriculture-dependent countries (column 4) have the highest percentage
    of agriculture in GDP (38.97%), the lowest GDP per capita (1222 US dollars), and
    the highest average monthly temperature (23.397 Degrees Celsius) and monthly total
    precipitation (123.821 Millimeters). They also have the lowest total outmigration
    (8.2 millions) and outmigration rates (0.10%). GDP per capita and cereal yields
    increase as agricultural share of GDP decreases. Total outmigration generally
    decreases as agricultural share of GDP increases.
  35: Temperature has a statistically significant negative effect on cereal yields
    in agriculture-dependent countries (columns 2, 3, and 4). Precipitation has a
    statistically significant positive effect on cereal yields in the most agriculture-dependent
    countries (column 4).
Methodology:
  7: Reduced-form regression analysis using country-pair fixed effects and origin
    and destination country specific linear time trends. The natural logarithm of
    lagged GDP per capita for both origin and destination countries are included as
    controls. The analysis focuses on current motivations for migration.
  8: Regression analysis with various control variables, regression techniques, different
    dependent and independent variables, and different samples. Robustness checks
    include varying the definition of 'agricultural countries' based on the share
    of agriculture value added in GDP. Also includes lagged temperature terms and
    lagged dependent variable.
  9: Various regression models tested, including weighted least squares and alternative
    fixed effects specifications; analysis considers lagged temperature effects and
    excludes top migration routes to ensure robustness.
  11: Fixed-effects two-stage least-squares (FE-2SLS) is used to estimate the relationship
    between cereal yields and international outmigration, using temperature and precipitation
    as instruments for cereal yields. OLS estimates were also computed for comparison
    with the FE-2SLS estimates.
  12: Fixed-effects two-stage least squares (FE-2SLS), Fixed-effects limited-information
    maximum-likelihood (FE-LIML), Instrumental Variables Approach using temperature
    or precipitation as instruments
  13: An empirical approach is used to quantify effects of weather on global bilateral
    migration; various model specifications and robustness checks are reported, including
    alternative definitions of migration and different thresholds for agricultural
    dependency.
  14: Reduced-form model and instrumental variables approach, using comprehensive
    international migration dataset over three decades.
  16: Theoretical model assessing equilibrium conditions of migration choices based
    on utility functions and economic parameters.
  18: Empirical analysis using a fixed-effects regression model to estimate the impact
    of temperature (TMP) and precipitation (PCP) on international migration rates.
  28: Reduced-form model with multiple robustness checks controlling for various factors.
  29: The analysis uses a regression model with country-pair fixed effects and destination
    and origin country-specific linear time trends, clustered standard errors by country
    pairs. The sample is split into quartiles based on migration stock, with columns
    (1) to (4) representing increasing popularity of destination countries. The model
    includes lagged GDP per capita of origin and destination countries as controls.
  30: FE-OLS (Fixed Effects Ordinary Least Squares) and FE-2SLS (Fixed Effects Two-Stage
    Least Squares) regressions are used. The analysis considers country fixed effects
    and country-specific time trends. Countries are grouped based on the share of
    agriculture value added in GDP.
  32: Various studies used unbalanced panel data and country-level panel data to examine
    the relationship between climate and migration, with findings extracted based
    on specific geographical settings.
  34: The analysis divides countries into four equal-sized groups based on the share
    of agriculture value added in GDP (lower quartile, median, and upper quartile).
    Summary statistics (mean and standard deviation) are then calculated for each
    group and for all countries.
  35: Regression analysis with robust standard errors clustered by country. Countries
    are grouped by quartiles based on the share of agriculture value added in GDP.
More Notes:
  7: The paper uses interaction terms between weather and agricultural dependence
    to test if the weather effect is different between the top 25% agriculture-dependent
    countries and the remaining countries.
  9: No specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes directly related to adaptation are
    discussed on this page.
  11: The F-statistics of the instruments are significant, but are all less than 10.
  12: The paper uses non-agricultural countries as a control group. The analysis focuses
    on agricultural countries.
  14: Future research should test these results as additional migration and climate/weather
    data becomes available. Alternative methods and tools should be used to study
    the relationships where appropriate.
  18: The model focuses on international migration and uses annual average temperature
    and precipitation data. The migration rate is defined as migration flow from origin
    country i to destination country j divided by the population of the origin country
    i at time t.
  30: The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the total outmigration rate
    from one country to all other countries. The analysis controls for country-specific
    factors (fixed effects) and time trends. Robust standard errors are clustered
    by country.
  32: Some studies found no significant role for climate in migration based on surveys,
    but these did not account for indirect effects through socio-economic shocks.
  34: Standard deviations are in parentheses. The data is at the country level, and
    the time period is not specified. The table focuses on descriptive statistics
    rather than causal relationships.
  35: The dependent variable is transformed using the natural logarithm. The analysis
    is divided into four country groups based on the share of agriculture in GDP,
    allowing for comparison of the impact of climate variables across different levels
    of agricultural dependence.

Outcomes of Interest:
  13: Study assesses the effects of weather variations on international migration

Quantitative material:
  7: "Each 1 \xB0C increase in temperature implies a 5% increase in out migration\
    \ from the top 25% agricultural countries (significant at the 1% level), as compared\
    \ to only 0.4% increase (statistically insignificant) in out migration from the\
    \ non-agricultural countries."
  8: 'Differential temperature effects for agricultural countries become larger in
    magnitude and more statistically significant when a higher threshold is set to
    identify agricultural countries (using different thresholds for agriculture value
    added in GDP: top 33%, 25%, and 20%).'
  11: Estimated elasticity of outmigration rate with respect to cereal yield in the
    top 25% agricultural countries is about -2.4. A 10% reduction in cereal yields
    would raise the annual outmigration rate by around 24%, or to 0.124% from a base
    of 0.1%.
