Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change, particularly temperature increases, and air pollution (particulate
    and ozone pollution) significantly impact crop yields.
  4: Climate factors (temperature) and pollution factors (AOD - aerosol optical depth)
  5: Climate (temperature, precipitation) and pollution factors (aerosol optical depth
    (AOD), surface ozone) impact crop yields.
  6: Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Surface Ozone, Temperature, Precipitation.
  8: Climate change (temperature and precipitation variations) and pollution (aerosol
    optical depth (AOD) and surface ozone).
  9: Aerosol variations, surface ozone levels, temperature increases, and precipitation
    changes.
  10: Temperature increase, precipitation changes, air pollution (particulate matter,
    ozone), global warming.
Highlights:
  1: Pollution mitigation currently outweighs the negative effects of climate change
    on crop yields, but future climate change is expected to reduce yields despite
    pollution mitigation.
  4: The study quantifies the different impacts of aerosol pollutants to crop yields
    before and after 2010. They find that the first order polynomial year variable
    is positive, indicating that the yield is increasing along the time, and the quadratic
    year variable is negative for all crops, which implies that the increasing rate
    of the yield is becoming level off.
  5: Rice production has a quasi-linear increase from 1980-2018; maize production
    increased faster after 2005; winter wheat accounts for 90% of total China wheat
    production.
  6: Particulate pollution reduces solar radiation, lowering plant photosynthesis
    and reducing crop yield. Winter wheat exhibits the largest sensitivity to particulate
    pollution.
  8: Reduction in aerosols in recent years stands out as a key driver of crop variations
    on the interannual timescale. Climate change is found to have a moderate reducing
    effect on wheat yield in 2006-2018, but generally smaller than 2%. Pollution mitigation
    effects dominate crop yield variations for rice and winter wheat regions.
  9: "Temperature increase is found to be the most critical factor for all three crop\
    \ types. The temporal evolutions and trends for rice and maize largely resemble\
    \ those of the temperature changes during 2020\u20132050. Winter wheat's net yield\
    \ trend during 2020\u20132050 is positive, mainly determined by the future aerosol\
    \ reduction."
  10: Recent abatement of anthropogenic emission results in a net crop gain, masking
    crop loss due to increased temperature and precipitation. Air pollution control
    policy has a co-benefit from agriculture and food perspectives. Global warming
    will outweigh benefits of pollution control, posing a great threat to global food
    security.
Methodology:
  1: Crop yield prediction models based on historical crop data, climate, and pollution
    records are used to assess the impacts on agriculture in China.
  4: Statistical yield model. Uses bootstrapping method with 1,000 crop models generated
    from 75% observations each year to determine 90% CIs. Dominance analysis is used
    to calculate the fractional contribution of different factors based on the residuals
    of the base model, which only includes yearly and provincial dummies. The country-averaged
    yield predictions are estimated by the statistical yield model holding at the
    current technology stage.  Future projections are obtained by resampling 1,000
    times the yield model with bootstrapping from historical observations.
  5: Regression model used to assess crop responses to climate and pollution factors.
    Two alternative models were used, but did not make a significant difference.
  6: Crop yield models are derived from historical data (1980-2018) to assess the
    impacts of air pollution and climate change. Dominance analysis is used to determine
    the percentage contribution of each factor to spatial variations in crop yields.
    Bootstrap resampling is used for confidence intervals.
  8: Panel regression model used to estimate crop yield based on historical climate
    and pollution data. Future yield changes are predicted using CMIP6 climate models
    under the SSP5-8.5 emission scenario, holding technology constant at 2015-2020
    levels. Bootstrapping is used to calculate error bars.
  9: "The future change in yield is estimated from the difference between projected\
    \ growing-season climate or pollution scenarios in 2021\u20132050 and the averaged\
    \ scenarios in 2015\u20132020, under RCP8.5."
  10: Robust statistical models are developed to predict crop yields based on temperature,
    precipitation, AOD, and surface ozone. Machine learning is used to predict ozone
    concentrations. The models account for technological innovations and policy practices.
    Analysis uses data from 1980 onward.
More Notes:
  4: The model assumes equal weight to different provinces regardless of their share
    in the national crop production, therefore, their estimation is interpreted as
    an overall average impact.  Interaction terms and non-linear fitting are also
    tested, but no significant increase in R^2 was found after adding interaction
    terms. Non-linear trends are added to the model using first and second order of
    polynomials regarding to years.
  5: The study focuses on the single-rice system, which accounts for more than 65%
    of total rice production in China.
  6: The study focuses on China, specifically the China Plain (wheat), Yangtze River
    Basin (rice), North China Plain and Northeast China (maize). AOD generally increased
    from 1980-2010, then decreased. Surface ozone showed small increasing trends before
    2013, followed by an abrupt and steep increase since 2014.
  8: "The analysis focuses on the impact of climate and pollution on crop yields,\
    \ without directly linking these changes to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.\
    \ The study isolates the effects of temperature, precipitation, aerosol, and surface\
    \ ozone levels on future yields under the assumption that the technology is held\
    \ as equivalent to the current years (2015\u20132020)."
  9: "The ozone concentration data used in the CMIP6 model outputs was converted to\
    \ MDA8 using the empirical relationship: MDA8 = MM \xD7 1.3 + 6.2."
  10: The study calls for consideration of air pollution impacts on agriculture and
    crop yield when projecting future food production and for accurate long-term projections
    of particulate and ozone pollution to assess future crop yield and to develop
    adaptation strategies. CO2 fertilization effect and nitrogen deposition can be
    captured by the model.

Quantitative material:
  1: "During 2010\u20132018, particulate pollution mitigation in China led to a net\
    \ crop yield increase of 0.5%\u20131.9%, and predicted future reductions in maize\
    \ and rice yields of 0.6 to 2.8% per decade by 2050 due to temperature increases."
  4: "Estimates relative yield changes (RYCs, unit: %) in 2006\u20132010 (or 2014\u2013\
    2018) compared to 1980\u20131984 (or 2006\u20132010) due to individual factors\
    \ for the largest 10 production provinces of each crop. Calculates 90% confidence\
    \ intervals (CIs) of each coefficient derived from the 5th and 95th percentiles\
    \ by repeating the model 1,000 times using 75% bootstrap sampling of provinces\
    \ for each year."
  5: Planted fraction (%) of rice, maize, and wheat in 10x10 km cells; climatology
    of MERRA2 aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm; climatology of surface ozone
    MDA8; time series of total crop production (Megatonnes) for each crop type from
    1980 to 2018.
  6: "Crop yield is reduced by 1.7%\u20135.9% per 0.1 increase in AOD. The mean AOD\
    \ during the growing season is 0.34, 0.35, and 0.42 for rice, maize, and wheat,\
    \ respectively. The mean MDA8 ozone during the growing season is 47.1, 49.7, and\
    \ 37.8 ppbv for rice, maize, and wheat, respectively."
  8: "Relative yield change (RYC) is quantified for different regions and crops, including\
    \ median estimates and 5%-95% percentile error bars. Mentions a projected 2\xB0\
    C increase in global temperature by the 2050s under SSP5-8.5 scenario compared\
    \ to 1995-2014."
  9: For rice by 2050, the ozone-induced yield loss is projected at -1.1%, and the
    aerosol-induced yield gain at +1.9%. Temperature increases can cause trends of
    -0.8%, -2.5%, and -0.6% per decade for rice, maize, and wheat, respectively.
  10: The study quantifies crop yield responses to different climate and pollution
    factors during different time periods.
