Drivers of Risk:
  3: The model considers unemployment, business cycles, and climate traits (temperature
    anomalies) as drivers of migration risk.
  4: "Anomaly in temperature (k_{i,t}), Existence of armed conflict (\u03D1_{i,t}),\
    \ Size of diasporas (m_{ij,t}), Expected inflow of net migration (E_t[n_{ij,t+1}])"
  6: Climate change impacts migration through country characteristics, with regional
    characteristics playing a role in migration decisions.
  7: Wars, migration (specifically asylum-associated migrants).
  8: Temperature anomaly (climate change), wars (armed conflicts).
  9: Temperature anomalies (climate change impacts) are considered a driver of immigration.
  11: No relevant information
Highlights:
  4: Governments react to migration inflows based on nominal GDP, expected net migration,
    and the size of diasporas. Higher GDP eases immigration rules, while increased
    expected net migration tightens them. Large diasporas also lead to harsher migration
    policies.
  8: Temperature anomaly negatively impacts asylum-associated migration, suggesting
    adaptive expectations where people plan to emigrate after climate change issues
    manifest.
  9: The study finds a positive and statistically significant relationship between
    temperature anomalies and immigration in low-income countries. This suggests that
    climate change forces people from lower-income states to leave their homes.
  11: First study analyzing bilateral migration between Germany and the rest of the
    world.
Methodology:
  3: The paper presents a model of migration based on the Rational-Choice Approach,
    focusing on bilateral migration flows between Germany and the rest of the world
    (155 nations) from 1995 to 2019. It models individual migration decisions based
    on expected income, country-specific attributes, and migration costs. Expected
    income is determined by average salary, employment probability, and business cycle.
  4: "Panel regressions; modeling a government\u2019s reaction function to migration\
    \ inflow."
  6: The study uses a panel consisting of 155 nations from 1995 to 2019, analyzing
    the migration data retrieved from OECD International Migration Database.
  7: Fixed effects regression, ordinary OLS, and PPML are the estimation methods;
    Hodrick-Prescott Filter to decompose GDP per capita into trend and cyclical parts.
  8: Fixed effects estimations of log(Immigration) using panel data. Models consider
    regular and asylum migration, with and without HDI components.
  9: Fixed effects regression analysis is used to estimate the relationship between
    immigration and various factors, including temperature anomalies, in low-income
    countries. The analysis considers regular and asylum immigration, with and without
    HDI components. Results are applicable to low-income countries.
  11: Analyzes bilateral migration between Germany and the rest of the world; suggests
    extending the analysis to other nations and considering non-linearities and demographic
    evolution.
More Notes:
  4: 'The analysis assumes that costs are fed through two channels: spatial distance
    and diaspora size.'
  6: The paper discusses human development factors such as educational levels and
    health services impacting migration and relates these to migration flows through
    Human Development Indicators.
  7: Uses Malaysia's temperature data as a proxy for Brunei Darussalam.
  8: The paper uses immigration volume as a proxy for individual migration decisions.
    It finds that the impact of climate change on migration decisions differs for
    regular migrants versus asylum seekers.
  9: The paper contrasts its findings with some literature suggesting a negative relationship
    between climate change impacts and immigration in low-income countries.  It argues
    that despite potential reduced agricultural productivity, people are motivated
    to move due to climate-related factors like droughts or starvation.
  11: The study focuses on migration patterns and their drivers, with a specific interest
    in how government policy impacts migration. The paper suggests considering demographic
    shifts in home countries as a factor influencing migratory decisions.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  4: Nominal GDP (Y_{j,t})
  7: GDP per capita, GNI per capita, unemployment rates, life expectancies at birth,
    educational levels.
  8: Immigration volume (as a proxy for migration decisions).
  9: The study examines the impact of temperature anomalies (Temp. Anomaly) on log(Immigration)
    in low-income countries.
  11: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  7: Uses data from World Bank and Human Development Reports. GNI difference of >=
    45,195 US Dollar compared to Germany is used to define low-income countries.
  8: 'The temperature anomaly has a statistically significant negative impact on asylum-associated
    migration volume: a surge of 1 degree in the anomaly shortens the migration volume
    by about 26%.'
  9: The table provides regression results (fixed effects estimation) showing the
    coefficients and standard errors for Temp. Anomaly and other variables influencing
    log(Immigration). For example, in Model 2.0, Temp. Anomaly has a coefficient of
    0.188 with a standard error of (0.105), which is statistically significant at
    p < 0.1.
