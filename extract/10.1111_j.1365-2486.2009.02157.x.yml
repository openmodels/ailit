Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change; deforestation; uncertainty in climate projections for South America;
    the range of sensitivity of ecosystem model responses to drought
  4: No relevant information
  5: Climate change impacts including changes in precipitation and temperature, using
    the SRES A2 emissions storyline.
  9: Climate change scenarios impact tree cover, aboveground live biomass, and soil
    carbon.
  14: Climate change impacts on tropical evergreen tree cover (water availability,
    light extinction, light-use efficiency, competition with drought-deciduous trees).
  28: No relevant information
Highlights:
  1: "Uncertainty for Amazon \u2018dieback\u2019 results from the uncertainty among\
    \ climate projections, not ecosystem dynamics."
  4: No relevant information
  5: No relevant information
  9: Basin-wide responses to climate change varied significantly between climate scenarios
    but little among parameter sets for tree cover, aboveground live biomass, and
    soil carbon. Western Amazonia had slight decrease/no change, whereas Eastern Amazonia
    had varying degrees of tropical evergreen cover for the various GCMs.
  14: The influence of different parameters and model components changes over time,
    with GCM and LPJ uncertainties increasing in importance over time relative to
    internal variability.
  28: Variability in soil carbon storage shows positive correlations with intrinsic
    quantum efficiency of CO2 uptake in C3 plants, photosynthesis scaling parameters,
    and photosynthesis co-limitation shape parameter across multiple sites. The strength
    of these correlations varies depending on the site (dry season length).
Methodology:
  1: Combines an ensemble of IPCC-AR4 climate change projections for the Amazon Basin
    with alternative ecosystem parameter sets for the dynamic global vegetation model,
    LPJmL; evaluates LPJmL simulations of carbon stocks and fluxes against flux tower
    and aboveground biomass datasets; variance partitioning approaches.

  5: The study uses data from eight GCMs involved with the IPCC Fourth Assessment
    Report. Climate model data (monthly precipitation, temperature, and percent cloud
    cover) were resampled to a 1x1 degree resolution grid using bilinear interpolation
    and bias corrected using an anomaly approach. Climate anomalies were calculated
    by comparing GCM values to a mean baseline period of 1961-1990. Simulations were
    performed at 1x1 spatial resolution starting in 1901 and ending in 2098.
  9: A land process and transport model (LPJ) was used to simulate carbon stocks and
    vegetation changes across the Amazon basin under different climate change scenarios.
    Parameter values were adjusted to better match observed biomass values. Simulations
    that produced regional carbon estimates outside observed ranges were removed.
  14: Variance partitioning is used to quantify the contribution of different sources
    of uncertainty (internal variability, GCMs, LPJ model) to predictions of tropical
    evergreen tree cover changes in the Eastern and Western Amazon.
  28: Partial correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship between
    variability in soil carbon storage and changes in parameter values at individual
    flux sites. The sites are ordered by dry season length. Parameters with partial
    correlation coefficients greater than 0.2 were selected for full Basin-wide simulation
    parameter set.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the Amazon basin and its carbon cycle feedbacks, particularly
    'dieback', not on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes at a national level. It suggests
    informing and prioritizing policy options related to mitigation and adaptation
    where long-term investments are required, but does not explicitly quantify costs,
    benefits, or macroeconomic risks.

  5: The focus of this excerpt is on the climate models and data used, specifically
    for the Amazon Basin. It mentions the importance of evaluating GCMs against climate
    observations and accounting for uncertainty in temperature and precipitation changes.
    The image is a map of the Amazon Basin showing the dry season length, used to
    evaluate flux tower sites.
  9: The study focuses on carbon stocks and vegetation in the Amazon basin, which
    could indirectly affect macroeconomic outcomes, but this link is not explicitly
    explored.
  14: The analysis is specific to tropical evergreen tree cover in the Amazon and
    its response to climate change; direct links to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes
    are not made within this page.
  28: The analysis focuses on soil carbon storage, not direct macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes. The parameters are related to plant physiology and ecosystem processes,
    potentially impacting carbon sequestration.
