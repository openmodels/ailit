Drivers of Risk:
  3: Increasing temperatures, heat wave frequency, ocean acidification, degradation
    of seabed habitats, increases in harmful blooms of algae and jellyfish.
  4: Human-induced CO2 emission, climate change, ocean acidification, rapid warming,
    increase frequency of extreme weather events, and rapid increase of human population
    around coasts.
  5: Ocean acidification impacts on fisheries and aquaculture in the Mediterranean
    Sea.
  7: Increasing seawater temperatures, invasive warm water species of algae, invertebrates,
    and fish increasing their geographical ranges.
  12: Ocean acidification due to elevated seawater CO2 conditions; Warming sea temperatures.
  15: Ocean acidification and warming.
  17: Elevated seawater temperature, invasion by non-indigenous algae species (benefitting
    from increased CO2 and temperature), ocean acidification, warming.
  19: rising CO2
  22: Acidification and warming of the Mediterranean Sea.
Highlights:
  3: Ocean acidification should be factored into fisheries and aquaculture management
    plans. It is recommended that ocean acidification is monitored with regular assessments
    of likely socio-economic impacts.
  17: Calcifying corals that form important habitats for fish, supporting their own
    fisheries, attracting recreational tourism, and supporting local economies appear
    to be particularly vulnerable.
Methodology:
  22: Integrated economic valuation of key economic sectors (tourism, fisheries) to
    assess losses from acidification and warming.
More Notes:
  7: The page focuses on the ecological impacts of climate change in the Mediterranean,
    particularly the spread of invasive species. While it mentions detrimental impacts
    on fisheries and some commercial exploitation of invasive species, it lacks quantitative
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal analysis at a national level. The reference to Cyprus
    provides the clearest link to a national-level impact (Octopus vulgaris and squid
    becoming scarce), but without further context or quantification of economic losses.
  12: Focuses on bivalves and oysters in the Mediterranean Sea. Indicates that the
    combination of warming and acidification extends the temporal window of sub-optimal
    conditions. Larval stages are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification,
    especially for mollusks.
  19: This page focuses on the ecological impacts of ocean acidification in the Mediterranean
    Sea and calls for an assessment of the socio-economic value of these ecosystems
    considering the impacts of ocean acidification.

  23: This page is an acknowledgements section and does not contain information about
    outcomes of interest, drivers of risk, quantitative material, methodology, or
    highlights related to the macroeconomic or macro-fiscal impacts of climate change
    and adaptation costs/benefits. It primarily focuses on thanking individuals, institutions,
    and funding sources.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Fisheries and aquaculture contribute to the economy of countries bordering the
    Mediterranean Sea and provide food and employment to coastal communities. Rising
    CO2 levels are expected to impact tourism.
  4: Aquaculture and fisheries contribute to local and national income.
  5: Direct employment of 250,000 and 123,000 people in fisheries and aquaculture
    respectively, and about 210,000 people in the secondary sector in the Mediterranean
    Sea.
  7: Detrimental impacts on fisheries. Some invasive species are now targeted commercially.
    Octopus vulgaris and squid becoming increasingly scarce, impacting the Cypriot
    economy.
  12: Decreased survival and growth of shellfish; Impaired recruitment of organisms
    from the plankton; Negative impacts on shellfish industries.
  15: Potential impacts on fisheries and aquaculture, impacting the availability of
    high-quality protein, minerals, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids; changes to
    biodiversity affecting the 'use value' of marine organisms (e.g., algae and sponges
    for bioactive metabolites); loss of 'non-use value' (bequest and existence value)
    associated with marine species.
  17: Potential loss of fisheries, reduced recreational tourism, and damage to local
    economies due to the decline of coral reefs. Shore erosion due to vermetid reef
    extinction.
  19: socio-economic value of these important systems, including ocean acidification
    impacts on ecosystem functioning and trophic web changes
  22: Losses in key economic sectors such as fisheries, aquaculture and tourism due
    to increasing acidification and warming of the Mediterranean Sea; Costs/benefits
    of policy action as well as the costs of policy inaction with regard to mitigation
    of and/or adaptation to acidification and warming.
Quantitative material:
  3: Fisheries and aquaculture employ approximately 600,000 people.
  4: Fisheries and aquaculture in the Mediterranean Sea represent 1% of world landings
    and 2% in terms of economic value; fish catches have remained stable since the
    1990s, aquaculture has quadrupled in production reaching 20% of production in
    2011; Pelagic fish account for 53% of the total Mediterranean catch (about 460,000
    tonnes in 2011).
  5: Demersal fish make up 30% of landings, crustaceans 7%, and molluscs (including
    cephalopods) comprise 10% of Mediterranean landings. Striped venus clam is around
    20,000 tonnes yr-1 (70% of mollusc landings). Gilthead seabream production rose
    from 3,833 tonnes in 1990 to 143,295 tonnes in 2010 (US$ 785 million). European
    seabass production rose from 2,944 tonnes in 1990 to 131,509 tonnes in 2010 (US$
    786 million). In 2010, 81% of Mediterranean meagre production was in Egypt.
