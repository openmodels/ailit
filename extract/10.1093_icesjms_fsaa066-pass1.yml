  4: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  4: Climate change impacts on fisheries (shifting wild-stock ranges, productivity
    and recruitment declines) and aquaculture (temperature, acidification, flooding,
    sea level rise, compromising health/infrastructure of cultured systems).
  8: Climate change (lack of specific climate change action plans for aquaculture).
Highlights:
  8: Most ICES countries have established comparatively conservative targets for increasing
    aquaculture production. Spatial planning is associated with acknowledgement of
    preparation for climate change (84% of sources).
Methodology:
  4: Assessment of change in aquatic sources of 20 ICES nations by comparing wild
    capture vs aquaculture production trends over the last five decades. Compilation
    of documents and sources from government and industry on proposed aquaculture
    growth targets for each country since 2013. Modeling of potential 2050 aquaculture
    increases to possible total seafood consumption, noting years of surplus or deficit.
    Identification of top non-ICES seafood-trade partners and their aquaculture production.
More Notes:
  4: The study focuses on ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea)
    nations and their seafood security in the face of climate change.
  5: This page describes the methods used in the paper but does not present specific
    results related to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes of climate change or adaptation.
    The study focuses on aquaculture production trends and future goals within ICES
    nations, examining the contribution of these nations to global seafood production
    and identifying aquaculture growth targets.
  8: The paper assesses aquaculture strategies of ICES member countries.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  8: Potential implications for the ability of countries to meet their own consumption
    demand and the tradeoffs therein.
Quantitative material:
  8: "Most countries have comparatively conservative targets (median magnitude = 2)\
    \ for increasing aquaculture production. Norway\u2019s target represents the most\
    \ substantial proposed increase in absolute production (3.8 million additional\
    \ tonnes). Portugal, Belgium and Spain\u2019s targets represent more modest increases\
    \ of 25 thousand tonnes, 820 tonnes, and 447 thousand tonnes, respectively."
