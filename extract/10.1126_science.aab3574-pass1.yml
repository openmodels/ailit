Drivers of Risk:
  2: The changing intensity and distribution of extreme events related to climate
    change, upstream dams and reservoirs trapping sediment, river channelization,
    urban construction, and groundwater extraction contribute to land subsidence and
    increased risk for deltas.
  3: Relative sea level rise (RSLR) driven by anthropogenic factors; Fluvial and coastal
    flooding.
  4: Increased energy prices are a likely reason for a rise in the cost of infrastructure,
    but factors such as relative increases in the costs of labor and material or rising
    interest rates would have similar impacts on infrastructure cost.
Highlights:
  2: Deltas with high rates of relative sea level rise (RSLR) and high socioeconomic
    vulnerability, such as the Krishna and Ganges-Brahmaputra, are increasingly at
    risk.
  3: Deltas are mapped into a risk space defined by anthropogenic, geophysical and
    socioeconomic characteristics, showing the relative vulnerability of different
    delta systems.
  4: Deltas in low-GDP regions are more sensitive to future risk increases stemming
    from increased exposure to hazardous events, while wealthy deltas see benefits
    from risk-reducing investments reduced in a more energy-constrained future.
Methodology:
  2: A systematic global-scale assessment of the changing risk profiles of coastal
    deltas is presented, using three component proxy indices to estimate per-capita
    risk trends for 48 deltas.
  3: Estimated Hazard (H), Exposure (E'), and Vulnerability (V) for 48 major coastal
    deltas using empirical indices derived from global data sets. Risk (R) is calculated
    as H*E*V, with change in expected loss (R') = HE'V. IDI is used as a proxy for
    V. The study maps 48 deltas into a risk space defined by anthropogenic, geophysical,
    and socioeconomic characteristics to assess relative risk.
  4: Scenario analysis is used to examine the sensitivity of delta risk to reduced
    infrastructure investment benefits by adjusting IDI scores based on 100-year projections
    of energy price growth in excess of GDP.
More Notes:
  3: The analysis focuses on interdelta differences in risk, using mature global datasets
    and spatial integration methods. The Investment Deficit Index (IDI) is used as
    a proxy for vulnerability.
  4: "A given increase in vulnerability will not affect risk trends in all deltas\
    \ equally; rather, its effect will be related to each delta\u2019s ACI and HEI\
    \ scores."
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: No relevant information
  4: Long-term sustainability of risk-reducing investments is questioned due to heavy
    reliance on external financial and energy subsidies.
Quantitative material:

  4: "Modernization and improvement costs across the Netherlands are projected to\
    \ reach \u20AC1 billion to \u20AC2 billion per annum over the next century."
