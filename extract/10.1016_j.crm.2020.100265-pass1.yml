Drivers of Risk:
  3: Climate hazards (heatwaves, floods, droughts, wildfire). Changing resource availability
    (water, energy demand).
  7: Temperature changes impacting health, energy use, transport, agriculture, wildfire,
    and hydrological droughts.
  8: Changes in temperature (heat stress during wheat flowering, milk yields, parasitic
    infections in sheep), drought (Standardised Precipitation-Evaporation Index (SPEI)),
    wildfire hazard (Met Office Fire Severity System (MOFSI)), and river flood risk/water
    resources drought (Standardised Streamflow Index).
  10: Increased summer variability leading to underestimation of changes in indicators
    based on high-temperature extremes; Disproportionate increase in daily rainfall
    on wetter days; Failure to incorporate potential increases in the urban heat island
    effect in climate projections (although the current effect is included).
  13: Changes in temperature (increase in hot days, heating/cooling degree days),
    changes in precipitation (drought, flood frequency), wildfire danger.
  20: Climate change impacts related to heatwave degree days and drought percentile.
    Specific weather-related risks include flood and drought (exceptional heat).
  25: Increasing climate hazards across the UK, including heat extremes, agricultural
    and hydrological droughts, wildfire danger, and fluvial flood hazard.
Highlights:
  3: Risks will increase across the UK without adaptation, but at different rates
    in different regions. Heat extremes, agricultural and hydrological drought, and
    wildfire risks increase. River flood risk increases particularly in the north
    and west. Cooling energy demand will increase, heating energy demand will decline.
  7: Identification of climate-related thresholds impacting various sectors such as
    health, transport, agriculture, and wildfire.
  8: Focuses on indicators relevant to agriculture, wildfire, river flood risk, and
    water resources drought. Acknowledges omissions such as indicators for natural
    environment management, coastal zone management, extreme storms/gales, and extreme
    short-duration precipitation. Also notes the absence of compound event analysis.
  10: The delta method assumes no change in relative climate variability and that
    proportional changes in a variable do not vary with its magnitude. These assumptions
    may lead to underestimation of extreme heat effects and impact rainfall estimates.
  13: The UK will likely experience substantial increases in hot days, heat-health
    alerts, growing degree days, wildfire danger, and changes in flood and drought
    frequencies, varying regionally. Changes in railway adverse weather days depend
    on location. Southern and eastern England are particularly vulnerable to increasing
    temperatures.
  20: Provides projections of changes in extreme weather events (heatwaves, drought)
    and related indices across different sectors (agriculture, transport, health).
  25: Climate hazards will increase across the whole of the UK, but at different rates
    and from different starting values in different regions. Risks associated with
    high-temperature extremes will increase the most in warmer southern and eastern
    England, but the rate of increase may be greater further north and west. Reducing
    future emissions reduces, but does not eliminate, climate risks.
Methodology:
  3: Uses UKCP18 climate projections to generate policy-relevant indicators of changing
    climate hazards and resources for various sectors in the UK. Analysis does not
    include explicit adaptation. Results are applicable to the UK.
  7: Analysis uses thresholds for climatic conditions affecting different sectors,
    with results averaged over a historical period.
  8: Uses HadUK-Grid 12 km resolution observational data, supplemented by ERA5 reanalysis
    data. Calculates various agri-climate indicators, wildfire hazard indicators,
    and hydrological indicators (river flood risk, water resources drought). Hydrological
    modeling using UKCEH Grid-to-Grid model (G2G) and a simpler hydrological model
    (Gosling and Arnell, 2010). Potential evaporation is calculated using the Penman-Monteith
    formula.
  10: "The study uses the delta method to apply monthly changes in climate variables\
    \ to observed daily time series, constructing a long reference time series by\
    \ repeating the 1981-2010 observed time series three times to 2100 and applying\
    \ annual climate change anomalies; Scenarios representing pathways reaching 2,\
    \ 3, and 4\xB0C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the 21st century were\
    \ extracted from RCP2.6, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 probabilistic projections, respectively."
  13: The analysis uses climate projections from HadGEM3 and CMIP5 to assess changes
    in various climate indicators and their potential impacts. Results are applicable
    to the UK and are focused on projections for the 2030s, 2050s, and 2080s.
  20: Analysis is performed using CMIP5 and HadGEM climate model output for various
    time periods (2041med, 2070 range, 2071med, 2100 range, 2010). Indicates range
    and median values (med).
  25: The paper uses the UKCP18 climate projections to calculate policy-relevant indicators
    of changing climate risks across different sectors. It focuses on changes in the
    hazard component of risk. Results are presented as plausible projections of change
    in risk under different emission scenarios, not predictions of future risks. An
    'adaptation pathways' approach is suggested, focusing on when adaptation measures
    need to be implemented as more information becomes available.
More Notes:
  3: "Resilience policy should recognise variability in risk change across the UK.\
    \ Explicit choices need to be made about \u2018worst case\u2019 emissions scenarios."
  7: Discussion includes the impact of adverse weather conditions on transport infrastructure
    and operations.
  8: Study calculates indicators relevant to a wide range of sectors but does not
    necessarily represent the most important dimensions of impact in a sector, and
    they are not equally important. G2G hydrological model was not run for Northern
    Ireland. Simplier hydrological model at a coarser spatial resolution was used
    at a coarse spatial resolution for all projections.
  10: The study uses observed data to characterize the current climate due to stakeholder
    familiarity, and avoids bias adjustment of UKCP18 projections due to the number
    of projections and locations and the uncertainty in future applicability of bias
    adjustments.
  13: The paper highlights the importance of considering regional variations in climate
    change impacts due to different climate change effects and local characteristics.
    The results depend on the specific climate model used (HadGEM3 vs. CMIP5).
  20: The data seems to be regionalized to Scotland and Ireland and incorporates various
    network data (Met Office network, Rail network). The focus is on exceedance of
    at least one of C-days.
  25: The paper does not consider changes in exposure and vulnerability or the effects
    of adaptation. The paper does not classify the changes in hazard and resource
    into risk categories. It highlights the need for enhanced adaptation and resilience
    alongside reducing emissions.
