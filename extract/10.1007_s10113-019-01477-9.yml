Drivers of Risk:
  2: Global mean temperatures > 2oC above pre-industrial levels; water scarcity, heat
    stress.
  4: The potential future under high-end climate change was explored using scenarios
    driven by the magnitude of greenhouse gas emissions.
  6: Changes in other parts of the world can have an (indirect) impact and thus potentially
    require adaptation measures
Highlights:
  2: "High-end climate change (>2\xB0C) can lead to benefits in some regions (e.g.,\
    \ increasing forest productivity in northern Europe) but detrimental effects in\
    \ others (e.g., water scarcity, heat stress, and productivity loss in southern/central/eastern\
    \ Europe, and widespread flood damage)."
  6: 'Three pathways were found to be robust in the face of climate and socio-economic
    uncertainty: (i) shift towards sustainable lifestyles; (ii) support and strengthen
    good governance for sustainability; and (iii) promote integrated and adaptive
    resource management for water, agriculture and energy. The authors conclude, however,
    that it is unlikely that these future actions alone are sufficient to fully enable
    Europe to achieve its vision of a sustainable future'
  7: "Conventional adaptation and mitigation solutions may not be enough beyond the\
    \ 2\xB0C threshold, necessitating transformative solutions that implement radically\
    \ different institutional arrangements, search for synergies between adaptation\
    \ and mitigation, and link them to sustainable development."
Methodology:
  2: 'Multi-sectoral impact models applied to integrated climate and socio-economic
    scenarios in five case studies: Hungary, Scotland, Iberia, Europe as a whole and
    Central Asia. Adaptation and mitigation pathways generated with stakeholders.'
  4: Effectiveness of adaptation pathways was evaluated through models and qualitative
    analyses.
  6: IMPRESSIONS project developed and implemented a novel methodology for developing
    transition pathways to move towards a more sustainable future
  7: The IMPRESSIONS project combines model-led climate trends with stakeholder-led
    socio-economic trends to provide multi-scale scenarios.
More Notes:
  2: The IMPRESSIONS project used a stakeholder-led approach to ensure research was
    driven by decision-maker priorities.
  4: Stakeholders played a central role in defining sustainable futures and in co-developing
    pathways and solutions.
  6: Europe is increasingly connected to the rest of the world via flows of people,
    capital, goods and resources and these flows are exposed to changes occurring
    outside its borders
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Loss of productivity in southern Europe and parts of central and eastern Europe,
    widespread flood damage.
