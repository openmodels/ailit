  6: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  2: Uncertainty in climate system calibrations (climate sensitivities and carbon
    cycle responses), discount rate, climate change, CO2 emissions, model uncertainty
  6: Incorrect calibration of climate models, discount rate, rate of time preference,
    curvature of cardinal utility, temperature increases, carbon cycle.
  22: Non-CO2 forcings; Uncertainties in carbon cycle and temperature equations; Extreme
    climate of the climate-economy (CE) model; Different socio-economic scenarios
    (fossil fuel dominated, mitigation, net-zero emissions).
  23: Emission of an additional unit of carbon; the calibration of the damage function;
    the path of emissions; future interest rates; exogenous forcing.
  24: Different climate calibrations (HadGEM2-ES, GISS-E2-R, MESMO) and emission scenarios
    (RCP8.5, RCP2.6), growth-adjusted interest rate
  25: Model uncertainty in temperature equation, extreme carbon cycle, emissions scenario
    (RCP2.6 vs. RCP8.5), discount rate, damage function (linear, quadratic, cubic),
    climate model uncertainty.
  26: Uncertainty in climate models, particularly related to the Equilibrium Climate
    Sensitivity (ECS) and the speed of warming, and the g-adjusted interest rate.
  27: Temperature increase (TAT), CO2 emissions (Et)
  28: Different CMIP5 calibrations for the carbon cycle and the temperature equation.
    Uncertainty in the climate model.
  29: Differences in climate calibrations, such as carbon cycle and temperature equation
    calibrations, are impacting outcomes.
  30: Differences in climate calibrations lead to large differences in damages and
    the social cost of carbon (SCC), impacting optimal mitigation choices. The choice
    of the damage function significantly influences the social cost of carbon.
  34: Variations in the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) influence growth-adjusted
    interest rates, impacting the SCC over time.
  35: "Uncertainty in climate sensitivity (ECS), uncertainty in the elasticity of\
    \ intertemporal substitution (\u03C8), miscalibration of the DICE-2016 model,\
    \ future interest rate levels, TFP growth."
Highlights:
  1: The appropriate choice of free model parameters in climate emulators can be of
    key relevance for the predicted social cost of carbon.
  2: DICE-2016's carbon cycle and temperature equations are miscalibrated. The social
    cost of carbon in DICE-2016 is oversensitive to the discount rate.
  6: DICE-2016's SCC is oversensitive to the discount rate due to incorrect calibration
    of the climate module. Flaws in the temperature equations and carbon cycle in
    DICE-2016 partially offset each other, giving plausible but ultimately incorrect
    results for optimal economic response to climate change. Optimal mitigation scenario
    in DICE-2016 predicts temperatures outside of the CMIP5 range.
  13: The page details the carbon cycle model used within a broader climate-economic
    framework, specifying the equations governing carbon transfer between atmospheric,
    upper ocean, and lower ocean reservoirs. It outlines the parameters and relationships
    used to calibrate the model and highlights the ability to adjust the time-step,
    addressing a limitation in the original DICE-2016 model.
  22: DICE-2016 fails calibration tests but passes other tests possibly due to compensating
    errors. A recalibrated version, CDICE, passes all four tests. Full-fledged ESMs
    do not agree on global mean temperature change. Non-CO2 forcings play a prominent
    role and contribute to uncertainty.
  23: In the BAU case of the DICE-2016 model, the effects of the climate model on
    emissions and the interest rates are tiny. If one assumes constant interest rates,
    the SCC relative to output is relatively constant across the next 50 years.
  24: The functional form of the damage function is very important, and higher-order
    terms can make a significant difference in the effect of climate model uncertainty
    on the SCC. The SCC is sensitive to both the climate model used and the emission
    scenario.
  25: Model uncertainty regarding temperature has a large impact on SCC. The choice
    of damage function (linear, quadratic, cubic) significantly influences the SCC
    and its sensitivity to emission scenarios and model uncertainty. SCC is lower
    for high-emission scenarios for linear damage functions and higher for cubic damage
    functions.
  26: Simply varying the ECS in climate-economic models is not a good proxy for extreme
    warming scenarios in CMIP5. DICE-2016 underestimates the SCC substantially at
    a discount factor of 0.96 (about 20% lower than CDICE) and overestimates at a
    discount factor of 0.99 (about 30% larger than CDICE).
  27: The paper presents optimal solutions for the adjusted DICE-2016 model (CDICE)
    and analyzes the impact of mitigation on damages from temperature increases. It
    also calculates the SCC under different scenarios (BAU and optimal mitigation).
  28: Different calibrations for the CE (carbon cycle and temperature equations) can
    have large effects on the optimal abatement. The emissions are not sensitive to
    the climate calibration used.
  29: The effect of climate calibrations on GDP damages can vary significantly, affecting
    optimal abatement strategies.
  30: Optimal emissions remain far above RCP 2.6 levels due to the DICE-2016 damage
    function specification and lack of carbon removal in the model. Differences in
    climate calibrations lead to huge differences in optimal mitigation.
  32: DICE-2016 implies slightly more optimal abatement than CDICE, but this difference
    is small because initial warming is lower in DICE-2016. DICE-2016 leads to atmospheric
    temperatures outside the CMIP5 range after 90 years.
  34: Key finding is that differences in the IES lead to more than a 50% variance
    in the SCC.
  35: "DICE-2016 miscalibration amplifies the effect of uncertainty in \u03C8. Different\
    \ preference specifications (leading to different interest rates) cause large\
    \ differences in optimal mitigation. Optimal long-run temperatures are much higher\
    \ in DICE-2016 than CDICE, and the spread is further exacerbated by different\
    \ values of \u03C8."
  36: DICE-2016 predictions fall within the range of CMIP5 due to compensating errors
    in calibration, making mitigation scenarios highly sensitive; the calibration
    of DICE-2016 is not suited for reliable policy analysis.
Methodology:
  1: Proposes a generic and transparent calibration and evaluation strategy for climate
    emulators based on freely and easily accessible state-of-the-art benchmark data
    from climate sciences.
  2: Re-calibration of the climate part of the DICE-2016 model using CMIP5 uncertainty
    range; Examination of the importance of the calibration for the social cost of
    carbon in a partial and simple general equilibrium setting.
  6: Compares DICE-2016 model with a re-calibrated version (CDICE) using different
    calibrations of extreme climate models within a general equilibrium framework.
    Uses partial equilibrium and general equilibrium settings. The re-calibrated model
    is updated with respect to the MMM (likely a climate dataset or study).
  13: The paper describes a linear three-box model of the carbon cycle (atmosphere,
    upper ocean, lower ocean) used in climate economics models like DICE-2016. It
    models global mean temperature using two coupled ordinary differential equations
    representing heat reservoirs (atmosphere/upper ocean and lower ocean). The model
    is anchored to a pre-industrial equilibrium state. It uses a time-step in years
    (/Delta1t) to update carbon mass in the three reservoirs based on emissions and
    mass transfer between reservoirs.
  22: Calibration and testing of climate-economy (CE) models, specifically the DICE
    model and a recalibrated version (CDICE). Includes tests to quantify the transient
    climate response and evaluate performance under strong forcing and mitigation,
    using CMIP5 data. Bracketing behavior of CMIP5 models for RCPs to measure uncertainty.
  23: "IAMs compute the net present value of all future damages caused by the emission\
    \ of an additional unit of carbon. A damage function, /Omega1(\xB7), multiplies\
    \ total output, Y_Grosst(\xB7), at time t to represent the impact of temperature\
    \ on economic activity. Constant interest and growth rates are assumed to make\
    \ general statements about the SCC. Analysis focuses on the year 2020 for reporting\
    \ the SCC."
  24: Compares SCC across different climate model calibrations (temperature and carbon
    cycle) under different emission scenarios, relative to the CDICE calibration,
    using a quadratic damage function. Analysis is performed by varying the growth-adjusted
    interest rate.
  25: Stylized exercise using different damage functions (linear, quadratic, cubic)
    and climate models (CDICE, HadGEM2-ES, GISS-E2-R, MESMO) under different emission
    scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP8.5) and g-adjusted interest rates.
  26: The paper analyzes the SCC using different calibrations of the DICE model and
    alternative temperature calibrations (CDICE-HadGEM2-ES and CDICE-GISS-E2-R) under
    the RCP 8.5 scenario with quadratic damage functions. The SCC is computed for
    the year 2020. The study also investigates how varying the ECS parameter affects
    the SCC and compares it to more complex climate model scenarios.
  27: The analysis uses the DICE-2016 model, adjusted (CDICE) with a re-calibrated
    climate part. The model is based on a planner's problem, maximizing a time-separable
    utility function subject to a capital accumulation constraint and emissions equation.
    The SCC is calculated as the marginal rate of substitution between atmospheric
    carbon concentration and the capital stock.
  29: The analysis uses different climate calibrations, particularly the DICE-2016
    model, and examines impacts over a range of 300 years.
  30: The analysis uses the DICE-2016 model to determine optimal mitigation choices
    based on different climate calibrations and their impact on damages and SCC. The
    social planner optimally chooses mitigation in the optimization-problem (8).
  32: The analysis uses the CDICE and DICE-2016 integrated assessment models to simulate
    climate and economic outcomes under different calibrations.
  34: The analysis uses the DICE-2016 model calibration to study the effects of varying
    the IES on interest rates and SCC over time.
  35: "Compares DICE-2016 calibration to CDICE with different ECS calibrations (HadGEM2-ES\
    \ and GISS-E2-R). Analysis focuses on optimal abatement and temperature pathways\
    \ under different assumptions about climate sensitivity (ECS) and the elasticity\
    \ of intertemporal substitution (\u03C8)."
  36: The paper develops a series of tests to evaluate the quality of Climate Emulators
    (CEs) used in economic modeling, updating the climate representation in the DICE
    model with a new calibration aligned with the CMIP5 benchmark.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on climate emulators, which are simplified climate models used
    by economists to link CO2 emissions and global warming.
  12: This page focuses on the calibration and testing of a climate model (CE) within
    Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), specifically using the DICE-2016 model as
    an example. While it discusses the impact of carbon emissions on temperature,
    it does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, or the costs
    and benefits of adaptation at a national level.
  13: The paper provides details of the carbon cycle model, which is a component of
    a larger integrated assessment model like DICE. The CE equations section indicates
    that the CE model has equations related to carbon emissions.
  23: "The paper compares the impact of their CDICE calibration with DICE-2016 consistently\
    \ by assuming exogenous forcing changes linearly with time, as specified in DICE-2016.\
    \ The paper refers to (1+r)/(1+g) simply as the \u201Cg-adjusted interest rate.\u201D"
  24: "The damage functions used in DICE-2016, Hansel et al. (2020) and Howard and\
    \ Sterner (2017) assume a quadratic functional form. The parameter \u03C82 is\
    \ irrelevant for the ratios of SCC for different calibrations but matters for\
    \ the absolute value."
  25: The concavity in the forcing equation counters the convexity of damages, making
    the overall shape of the cost function unknown a priori.
  26: The speed of warming is more important than the very long run behavior of temperature
    when considering the social cost of carbon. Modeling climate uncertainty by simply
    varying the ECS parameters incorrectly reduces the uncertainty about the SCC.
  27: "The model includes non-industrial emissions (E Landt) and industrial emissions\
    \ (\u03C3t Y Grosst)."
  30: The optimal tax on carbon, equivalent to the SCC in the model, is slightly below
    what is typically discussed for economic policy purposes.
  32: The parameters that determine the very long run of the climate system are more
    or less irrelevant to temperature over the next 300 years and, therefore, for
    the SCC that determines optimal policy today.
  35: "The paper suggests that using the DICE-2016 climate calibration in more complex\
    \ models with uncertainty and Epstein\u2013Zin utility may lead to serious problems."
  36: The paper advocates for a battery of tests to identify issues in climate models
    used in climate economics.

Quantitative material:
  2: Model uncertainty from different consistent calibrations of the climate system
    can change the social cost of carbon by a factor of 4 if one assumes a quadratic
    damage function.
  6: "The DICE-2016 model predicts long-run temperature about 1\xB0C higher than their\
    \ calibration. DICE-2016 carbon taxes are too low."
  13: No relevant information
  23: Exogenous forcing, F_EXt, changes linearly with time from 0.5 in the year 2015
    to 1.0 in 2100 (DICE-2016 specification).
  24: The figure displays the SCC under two different RCP emission scenarios and four
    different calibrations of a climate-economic model, relative to the CDICE MMM
    social cost of carbon for RCP26, across a range of growth-adjusted interest rates
    from 0.5% to 4%. SCC values relative to CDICE-2.6 range from 0.5 to about 2.0.
  25: SCC can be three to five times higher for pessimistic temperature scenarios
    compared to optimistic scenarios. Extreme carbon cycle increases SCC by about
    20% relative to the MMM. SCC doesn't change much with alternative emissions scenarios
    compared to climate model uncertainty and discount factor effects. SCC can be
    almost eight times higher for the most pessimistic climate scenario compared to
    the most optimistic scenario with cubic damages, depending on the interest rate.
  26: The SCC is quantified relative to a CDICE calibration, and differences in SCC
    are presented for various ECS values (2.15 and 4.55) and across different models
    (CDICE, DICE-2016).
  27: "The model uses parameters like intertemporal elasticity of substitution (\u03C8\
    ), time preference parameter (\u03B2), capital share (\u03B1), depreciation rate\
    \ (\u03B4), and emission intensity (\u03C3t)."
  28: Mentions equations for the social cost of carbon (SCC) and the optimal carbon
    tax, and discusses units of measurement (USD/tC).
  29: Three vastly different predictions for CO2 concentrations based on climate calibrations;
    g-adjusted interest rate starts close to zero and converges to 1.5% in the long
    run.
  30: Temperature rise in the MMM calibration reaches 3K and stays there for hundreds
    of years; in the most pessimistic calibration, it rises by over 4K. Optimal mitigation
    differences between climate calibrations can be a factor of three over the next
    80 years.
  34: The paper provides a comparison of growth-adjusted interest rates and SCC for
    different values of the IES, indicating a significant disparity over 200 years.
  35: "Optimal warming under DICE-2016 can reach almost 6 degrees in 200 years for\
    \ high ECS and high \u03C8, or more than 4.5 K for MMM calibration and high \u03C8\
    . Carbon usage is extended by about 50 years in DICE-2016 relative to the low\
    \ IES case for large \u03C8."
