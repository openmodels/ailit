Drivers of Risk:
  2: Potential future changes in environmental conditions, including temperature and
    ocean pH, as well as emissions scenarios, are considered as impacting factors
    for the stock assessment.
  6: This page describes fishing mortality (F) as a driver.
  8: The key driver impacting outcomes is the change in summer sea surface temperature,
    which influences recruitment and growth.
  9: Summer sea surface temperature (SST) impacts growth (L1.5) and recruitment deviations,
    influencing fish stock sustainability.
  10: Increases in temperature are identified as a driver of risk, leading to lower
    recruitment of Pacific cod.
  11: The impact of environmental variables on recruitment and the stock-recruitment
    relationship is considered, with particular attention to the absence of links
    between environment and recruitment.
  12: Summer sea surface temperature (SST) impacts growth and recruitment, affecting
    spawning biomass. Earth System Model uncertainty.
  13: Environmental variables, specifically warming and marine heatwaves in the Bering
    Sea
  14: Temperature and pH on growth and recruitment of Pacific cod are drivers of risk.
  16: Future levels of climate warming.
Evaluation overview:
  2: The paper evaluates the consequences of adopting various harvest control rules
    and climate-enhanced stock assessments for EBS Pacific cod in relation to future
    stock status and fishing mortality.
  6: The paper evaluates different assessment model configurations for fisheries management,
    focusing on the impact of harvest control rules on net revenue and sustainable
    yields of EBS Pacific cod.
  8: The paper evaluates the projected changes in spawning biomass of Pacific cod
    in the eastern Bering Sea under various environmental scenarios, particularly
    focusing on declines after 2040.
  9: The outcome being evaluated is the effect of sea surface temperature (SST) on
    cod productivity, specifically focusing on growth (L1.5) and recruitment.
  10: The paper evaluates the impact of climate change (specifically temperature increases)
    on Pacific cod spawning biomass and catch.
  11: The assessment focuses on model configurations for Pacific cod in the Gulf of
    Alaska, specifically looking at recruitment and biomass projections.
  12: The paper evaluates the time-trajectory of spawning biomass relative to the
    unfished level for different catch series.
  13: Spawning biomass of EBS (eastern Bering Sea) Pacific cod.
  14: Probability of spawning biomass dropping below four threshold levels and the
    distribution for the relative profit are evaluated for catch time-series.
  16: Declines in biomass and catch for Eastern Bering Sea (EBS) Pacific cod.
Highlights:
  2: The analysis suggests that climate-aware management through conventional harvest
    control rules can help guide stock management without needing fundamental changes
    to management structures while integrating environmental variables in the analysis.
  8: Results from more pessimistic scenarios show substantial decreases in biomass,
    particularly when threshold harvest strategies are not applied.
  9: Higher risks to cod biomass are associated with scenarios using MIROC ssp126,
    while scenarios like GFDL ssp585 help maintain cod stock above thresholds.
  10: Increases in temperature will lead to lower recruitment despite higher weight-at-age,
    and harvest control rules not accounting for climate change may fail to conserve
    the stock.
  11: Significant model uncertainty exists which could affect projections more than
    environmental scenarios; the exact configuration of assessment models could be
    critical.
  12: Accounting for Earth System Model uncertainty is important in resource analysis
    and management. Projected biomass and catch differ under different environmental
    models, even under the same emission scenario.
  13: The spawning area of EBS Pacific cod may expand in the southern part of the
    eastern Bering Sea under warming, but there is low potential for spawning in the
    northern part where Pacific cod redistributed during recent marine heatwaves.
  14: Updating projections based on climate-enhanced stock assessments and reviewing
    relationships between environmental variables and population parameters should
    be a standard part of stock assessment.
  16: "Results indicate declines in biomass and catch for EBS Pacific cod will increase\
    \ with future levels of climate warming; Basing catch limits on the null environmental\
    \ model or MIROC ssp126 is predicted to lead to population crash; NPFMC 40\u2013\
    5 harvest control rule attenuates biomass declines relative to a constant FMEY\
    \ harvest control rule through reduced catch; Climate effects in the scenarios\
    \ with the highest warming rates exceed the benefit of the harvest control rule\
    \ by the end of the century (under GFDL, and MIROC ssp585 forcing scenarios)."
Methodology:
  2: The analysis uses a climate-enhanced stock assessment approach employing Earth
    System Models and emission scenarios to project future environmental variables
    related to stock dynamics.
  4: The paper details a methodology for projecting future catch series of a stock
    assessment model, accounting for uncertainty in model structure, environmental
    variables, and Earth System Model/emissions scenarios. It uses a Bayesian framework
    with NUTS MCMC sampling and penalized likelihood.
  6: The analysis uses assessment models with different configurations to evaluate
    harvest control rules, including the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
    Tier 3 40-5 harvest control rule and a constant FMEY strategy. The FMEY strategy
    calculates net revenue based on equilibrium catch, price, and fishing costs. The
    harvest control rules relate to achieving sustainable yields but does not explicitly
    account for the economic factors associated with fishing that can be related to
    optimum yield. Economic data from trawl catcher/processors that fish for Pacific
    cod and other groundfish in the eastern Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska is used.
  8: The analysis uses different assessment model configurations and emission scenarios
    (e.g., MIROC ssp126, GFDL ssp585) to project future states of cod stocks.
  9: Analysis involves projections from models based on MLEs focusing on environmental
    scenarios (e.g., MIROC ssp126 and GFDL ssp585), with uncertainty in parameters
    and recruitment deviations considered.
  10: The analysis uses environmental models to project spawning biomass and catch
    under different temperature scenarios, and considers different assessment model
    configurations and harvest control rules. The results are applicable until 2099
    based on current models and assumptions.
  11: Projections use models from the US North Pacific Fishery Management Council,
    highlighting the need for broader models including the CEATTLE model and potential
    stock-recruitment relationships.
  12: The analysis uses assessment model configurations, with projections based on
    MLE parameter estimates and catch limits from MIROC ssp126 and GFDL ssp585 scenarios.
    Model selection approaches were used to select the relationships between population
    parameters and environmental variables. The results are applicable to the years
    1977-2022 for model fitting, with projections extending beyond that period.
  13: Projections accounting for parameter uncertainty and process error are used
    to model spawning biomass from 1980-2010. Assumes stationarity in the relationship
    between environmental conditions and recruitment.
  14: "The analysis uses 28 catch time-series based on a 40\u20135 control rule for\
    \ projections, considering parameter uncertainty and future process error. Different\
    \ catch limits (ssp) from different climate models are applied."
  16: Uses Stock Synthesis to conduct assessments for many years of a long projection
    period for potential operating models; considers effects of feedback control and
    climate adaptation using management strategy evaluation.
More Notes:
  10: The analysis suggests that even with perfect information about stock status,
    declines in biomass and catch are likely if current harvest control rules continue.
    The harvest control rules are based on FMEY rather than FMSY, leading to conservative
    management outcomes.
  11: Future work could improve projections by integrating stock-recruitment relationships
    and expanding environmental scenarios.
  12: The climate change signals simulated by Earth System Models only differ significantly
    across the models and emission scenarios in the longer-term future (after the
    mid-21st century). The projections assume relationships between population parameters
    and environmental variables.
  13: The analysis does not account for potential biological adaptation to climate
    change or changes in the relationship between environmental variables and recruitment.
  14: Increased temperature was found to also be associated with increased metabolic
    demand and mortality, and with decreased availability and energy content of prey.
Quantitative material:
  2: The paper discusses the projected catch series based on the ensemble of Earth
    System Models and alternative emission scenarios, aiming to account for the range
    of uncertainties.
  4: The methodology involves 1000 draws from posterior distributions, five MCMC chains
    of length 1200 (discarding the first 200), and thinning by conducting projections
    for every 5th vector, resulting in 5000 parameter vectors.
  6: "The page provides specific values for the price of cod (\u0303p = 1,563 $/t)\
    \ and the daily cost of fishing (\u0303c = 66,543 $/d). It also mentions a recruitment\
    \ variation parameter (\u03C3R = 0.6642). Estimated total parameters of model\
    \ configurations 1-4 are 504, 463, 466, and 464 respectively."
  8: Quantitative projections indicate that spawning biomass will fall below 40% of
    unfished levels and possibly below 20% under certain scenarios.
  9: "Histograms show SST impacts with L\u221E values ranging from 0.05 to 0.25 and\
    \ recruitment deviations from -0.2 to 0.6."
  10: The graphs show projected time trajectories of spawning biomass and catch from
    1977-2099 under different environmental scenarios, however specific quantitative
    data for each model is not included in the text.
  11: Projections are based on the assumption of mean recruitment without environmental
    links, identified as overly optimistic when biomass is declining.
  12: The graphs show distributions of spawning biomass over time relative to unfished
    levels, with median (blue line), 50% (light shaded area), and 90% (dark shaded
    area) confidence intervals. Green and red lines represent 40% and 20% of average
    unfished biomass when climate effects are ignored.
  13: The probability of being below 20% of unfished spawning biomass is provided
    as bars in the upper right corner of a figure.
  14: The figure includes probabilities, medians, 50% intervals, and 90% intervals.
  16: Catch limits based on GFDF ssp585 generally keeps the stock above the threshold
    of 20% of unfished spawning biomass.
