Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increases in temperature which increase weight-at-age but reduce recruitment
    of fish stocks.
  8: Summer sea surface temperature (SST) driven by climate change scenarios (ssp126,
    ssp585)
  9: Summer sea surface temperature (SST) impacting growth and recruitment of cod.
Highlights:
  1: Current harvest control rules may fail to conserve fish stocks if inferred catch
    limits are taken, leading to declines in biomass, catch, and profits. Basing future
    catches on the environmental scenario that leads to the poorest outcomes (GFDL
    ssp585) generally keeps the stock above the threshold of 20% of unfished spawning
    biomass and achieves long-term profits at or greater than those expected in the
    next ten years.
  8: Catches and spawning biomass of Pacific cod are projected to decline, especially
    after 2040, with some scenarios predicting the stock will drop below 20% of unfished
    spawning biomass. Even optimistic environmental scenarios (ssp126) result in spawning
    biomass below the target level of 40%. The impact of the environmental scenario
    is larger than the impact of assessment model configuration.
  9: Environmental effects will, more likely than not, lead to lower production and
    hence lower sustainable catches.
Methodology:
  1: Uses a framework for conducting projections that allows for structural model
    uncertainty (population dynamics model, Earth System Models, emission scenarios),
    process error in future recruitment, and uncertainty in parameter estimates of
    the population dynamics model. Applies it to Pacific cod in the eastern Bering
    Sea, with projections based on a harvest control rule maximizing the difference
    between revenue and variable costs.
  8: Assessment models are used to project spawning biomass based on different climate
    scenarios and harvest strategies. Model uncertainty is addressed by using multiple
    assessment model configurations and environmental scenarios. Time horizon for
    projections appears to be until the end of the projection period, with specific
    mention of outcomes after 2040.
  9: Extended single-species models were used to examine the consequences of future
    climate impacts on cod. The study projects the one of the three catch time-series
    from the null environmental model and MIROC spp126 (leading to population collapse),
    and from GFDL ssp585, and examines parameter uncertainty and future process error
    on spawning biomass.
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on a specific fishery (Pacific cod) in a specific region (eastern
    Bering Sea), so the direct applicability to nation-wide macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    outcomes is limited. However, the methodology for incorporating environmental
    uncertainty into resource management decisions could be relevant.
  8: "The analysis considers the effects of different harvest control rules (40-5\
    \ and constant F) on the outcomes. The relationship between recruitment and environmental\
    \ drivers is relatively weak, as indicated by the low R\xB2 values."
  9: Catch limits based on the threshold control rule and GFDL ssp585 (and CESM ssp585)
    result in lower risks, while catch limits based on the constant F control rule
    and catches from MIROC ssp126 result in higher risks. A catch control rule that
    reduces catch limits in the face of reduced biomass has benefits.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Profits for the fishery, biomass and catch levels.
  8: Catches and spawning biomass of Pacific cod in the eastern Bering Sea
  9: Profit during the last 20 years of the projection period expressed as a percentage
    of that during the first 10 years of this period.
Quantitative material:
  1: Threshold of 20% of unfished spawning biomass.
  8: "Projections of spawning biomass relative to unfished levels under different\
    \ climate scenarios; R\xB2 values (0.168, 0.157, 0.157, 0.117) for recruitment\
    \ vs. environmental driver relationships; Target level of spawning biomass of\
    \ 40% of the unfished level."
  9: Distributions for the profit percentages are very wide, with medians at or above
    100 % for the strategies except when catch limits are based on the assumption
    that SST does not impact growth or recruitment and when catch limits are based
    on MIROC ssp126.
