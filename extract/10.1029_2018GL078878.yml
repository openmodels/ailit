Drivers of Risk:
  8: The page discusses changes in North Sea circulation driven by increased stratification
    in the Faeroe-Shetland Channel and a reduction in the poleward density gradient
    due to freshening of the North Atlantic Current.
Highlights:
  8: The study identifies key drivers for changes in North Sea circulation and finds
    that a substantial increase in stratification in the Faeroe-Shetland Channel and
    a reduction in the poleward density gradient are important factors. A reduction
    in North Sea inflow is likely unique to this region.
Methodology:
  8: The paper uses two climate scenarios (E1 and E2) and analyzes changes in ocean
    currents and salinity. It also uses CMIP5 simulations to estimate the likelihood
    of circulation changes.
More Notes:
  8: The study acknowledges uncertainty due to the inherent difficulty in modeling
    density and circulation in climate models at high latitudes. The analysis focuses
    on oceanographic processes and their drivers, not macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
