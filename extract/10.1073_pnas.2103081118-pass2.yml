Drivers of Risk:
  1: Thawing permafrost, ice sheet disintegration, changes in atmospheric circulation,
    dissociation of ocean methane hydrates.
  2: The shocks impacting the SCC are climate tipping points, including permafrost
    carbon feedback, ocean methane hydrates dissociation, ice sheet disintegration
    (WAIS and GIS), changes in atmospheric circulation (Atlantic Meridional Overturning
    Circulation slowdown and Indian summer monsoon variability), Amazon dieback, and
    Surface Albedo Feedback.
  3: The drivers of risk are climate tipping points, including permafrost carbon release,
    ocean methane hydrate dissociation, slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
    Circulation (AMOC), weakening of the Subpolar gyre (SAF), and changes in the Indian
    Summer Monsoon (ISM).
  5: Disintegration of the GIS and WAIS, permafrost carbon feedback, dissociation
    of ocean methane hydrates, weakening of the Southern Ocean overturning (SAF),
    and AMOC slowdown are identified as tipping points impacting outcomes.
  6: Additional warming, sea level rise (SLR) are impacted by climate tipping points.
    The analysis models the impact of eight tipping points affecting temperatures
    or SLR.
  7: The drivers of risk include greenhouse gas emissions, global mean surface temperature
    changes, sea level rise (SLR), and variability of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM)
    leading to floods or droughts. Climate tipping points such as AMOC slowdown, SAF
    weakening, permafrost thaw, GIS and WAIS disintegration are also considered.
  8: Permafrost carbon feedback (CO2 and CH4 emissions); Dissociation of ocean methane
    hydrates (CH4 emissions); Arctic sea ice loss (changes in radiative forcing);
    Dieback of the Amazon rainforest (CO2 release); Disintegration of the Greenland
    and West Antarctic Ice Sheets (sea level rise); Slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional
    Overturning Circulation (AMOC) modulates the relationship between global mean
    surface temperature and national mean surface temperature; Variability of the
    Indian summer monsoon directly affects GDP per capita in India.

Evaluation overview:
  1: Economic impacts of climate tipping points, specifically on the social cost of
    carbon (SCC).
  2: The paper evaluates the economic cost of emitting one additional ton of CO2,
    specifically the marginal damage cost or Social Cost of Carbon (SCC).
  3: The paper evaluates the impact of climate tipping points on the Social Cost of
    Carbon (SCC).
  5: Welfare changes are normalized to global mean consumption per capita, consumption
    losses, and utility losses. Focuses on the social cost of carbon (SCC) at the
    country level.
  6: Economic impacts of climate tipping points, specifically the change in world
    consumption per capita due to tipping points, relative to world consumption per
    capita without climate damages.
  7: The paper evaluates the economic costs and social cost of carbon (SCC), considering
    climate tipping points.
  8: GDP per capita in India; Social Cost of Carbon (SCC).
  9: Economic impacts of tipping points in the climate system
Highlights:
  1: Climate tipping points increase global economic risk, increasing economic losses
    almost everywhere. The tipping points with the largest effects are dissociation
    of ocean methane hydrates and thawing permafrost.
  2: Climate tipping points, especially ocean methane hydrates and permafrost carbon
    feedback, significantly increase the Social Cost of Carbon. The effect of tipping
    points on the SCC has a positively skewed distribution. Disintegration of the
    WAIS and GIS may be underestimated due to differences between the implemented
    models and process-based models within the IPCC AR5.
  3: Climate tipping points, both individually and collectively, generally increase
    the expected SCC. However, some tipping points, such as AMOC slowdown and SAF
    weakening, can decrease the SCC. Interactions between tipping points can offset
    each other, resulting in a net effect that is different from the sum of the individual
    effects. High risk aversion amplifies the impact of tipping points on the SCC.
  5: Tipping points increase the temperature response to GHG emissions. GIS and WAIS
    disintegration primarily affects countries with low-lying coastal populations.
    Permafrost carbon feedback, dissociation of ocean methane hydrates, and the SAF
    primarily affect temperature, with impacts dependent on a country's optimum temperature
    and latitude. AMOC slowdown benefits Europe but increases climate damages in parts
    of central Asia.
  6: Climate tipping points can significantly affect temperature, sea level rise,
    and economic outcomes. The additional change in global impact due to tipping points
    demonstrates a clear increasing trend. The red, blue, and gray scatterplots show
    additional warming, sea level rise, and damages from tipping points. A nonlinear
    fit is used for temperature and damages, while a linear fit is used for SLR.
  7: Climate tipping points increase the overall level of risk in the global economy
    and increase economic costs almost everywhere. Tipping points do not have a significant
    effect on inequality.
  8: Includes eight tipping modules representing major climate tipping points and
    their feedbacks.
  9: Economic impacts of tipping points in the climate system.
Methodology:
  1: Meta-analytic integrated assessment model (IAM) with a modular structure, including
    national-level climate damages from rising temperatures and sea levels for 180
    countries, calibrated on detailed econometric evidence and simulation modeling.
  3: The expected SCC is computed over 10,000 Monte Carlo draws with 0.1% trimmed,
    using RCP4.5-SSP2 emissions and GDP/population growth scenarios. The study also
    uses a flexible specification of climate damages that is able to capture a range
    of assumptions regarding whether climate damages impact the level of economic
    activity or its growth rate.
  5: Monte Carlo sample size is 10,000 with 0.1% trimmed. Uses RCP4.5-SSP2 emissions
    and GDP/population growth scenarios. Utilizes Hope and Schaefer PCF, Whiteman
    et al. beta OMH, and IPSL AMOC hosing.
  6: 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations are used under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios,
    sampled on a decadal interval (2020, 2030,...2200). A nonlinear fit is used for
    temperature and damages; a linear fit is used for SLR. The specification includes
    Hope and Schaefer PCF, Whiteman et al. beta OMH, and IPSL AMOC hosing.
  7: The study uses a meta-analytic integrated assessment model (IAM). It uses the
    FAIR model to represent the carbon cycle and simulates warming using a two-box
    model. Temperature changes are downscaled to the national level and fed into country-specific
    damage functions. SLR is mapped on damages at the national level. Damages from
    temperature and SLR are allowed to affect either the short-term level of GDP or
    long-term growth prospects.
  8: Estimates the SCC by running the model twice, once with a pulse of emissions
    in 2020, then comparing the welfare differences between the two runs per ton of
    CO2 emissions; Uses eight tipping modules corresponding to listed tipping points.
More Notes:
  1: The authors note that their numbers are probable underestimates, given that some
    tipping points, tipping point interactions, and impact channels have not been
    covered in the literature so far. They also provide a reduced-form tipping points
    damage function that could be incorporated in other IAMs.
  2: The paper acknowledges that the 24.5% increase in SCC is likely an underestimate
    due to limitations in the existing literature and potential impact channels and
    interactions not yet covered.
  3: The paper explores uncertainty in the SCC estimates through sensitivity analyses,
    including variations in emissions scenarios and model specifications. The effect
    of the permafrost carbon feedback is similar across different published studies,
    but the effect of ocean methane hydrates dissociation is sensitive to different
    emissions impulse scenarios.
  5: Provides a reduced-form climate tipping point damage function that could be integrated
    into other Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs). The SCC is calculated by converting
    consumption losses into utility losses and then taking the discounted sum from
    2020 until the end of the modeling horizon.
  6: The analysis synthesizes fragmented literature modeling the economic impacts
    of climate tipping points. The aim is to develop a more quantitative, structured
    understanding of the issue.
  7: The study acknowledges several limitations including incomplete coverage of climate
    tipping points and interactions between them, potentially missing climate impacts,
    uncertainties in the tipping point modules, and uncertainties in climate science
    and economics.
  8: Simulation model data available on GitHub.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Climate tipping points increase the social cost of carbon (SCC) by \u223C25%\
    \ in our main speci\uFB01cation. \u223C10% chance of climate tipping points more\
    \ than doubling the SCC."
  2: Combining all eight tipping points increases the expected SCC by 24.5%. The median
    percentage increase in the SCC from all tipping points combined is 18.8%, the
    75th percentile is 22.5%, and the 99.5th percentile is 132.2%. Ocean methane hydrates
    dissociation increases the expected SCC by 13.1%, and the permafrost carbon feedback
    increases it by 8.4%. Disintegration of the WAIS increases the expected SCC by
    2.9%, and disintegration of the GIS increases it by 1.8%. Indian summer monsoon
    variability increases the expected SCC by 1.3%. Dieback of the Amazon rainforest
    leads to a modest 0.1% increase. Slowdown of the AMOC reduces the expected SCC
    by 1.4%. The Surface Albedo Feedback (SAF) reduces the expected SCC by 1.7%.
  3: The paper provides estimates of the percentage change in the SCC due to individual
    and combined climate tipping points, e.g., permafrost carbon leads to an 8.4%
    increase, ocean methane hydrates to a 13.1% increase, and all tipping points combined
    to a 24.5% increase. It also reports on the effects of costly TPs and the interactions
    of all TPs.
  5: "2\xB0C warming in the absence of tipping points corresponds to 2.3\xB0C warming\
    \ in the presence of tipping points. Tipping points reduce global consumption\
    \ per capita by around 1% upon 3\xB0C warming and by around 1.4% upon 6\xB0C warming,\
    \ based on a second-order polynomial fit of the data. In some runs, damages exceed\
    \ 4%. A linear fit of the SLR data implies 61% more SLR at any given level."
  6: Scatterplots show the relationship between GMST (Global Mean Surface Temperature)
    change, SLR, and global impact without tipping points versus the additional change
    after tipping points. Linear regression equations and R-squared values are provided
    for each plot.

    relationship between temperature and economic losses.
