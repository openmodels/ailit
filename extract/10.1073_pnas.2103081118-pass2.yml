Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate tipping points like thawing permafrost, ice sheet disintegration, and
    changes in atmospheric circulation.
  2: Climate tipping points, including permafrost carbon feedback, ocean methane hydrates
    dissociation, ice sheet disintegration (WAIS, GIS), changes in atmospheric circulation
    (AMOC slowdown, Indian summer monsoon variability), and Amazon rainforest dieback.
  3: Climate tipping points (TPs), such as permafrost carbon feedback, ocean methane
    hydrates dissociation, weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
    (AMOC), and changes in ice sheet dynamics, are the primary drivers of risk.
  5: 'Climate tipping points: Disintegration of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) and
    West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), permafrost carbon feedback, dissociation of ocean
    methane hydrates, slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
    (AMOC), weakening of the Southern Ocean carbon sink (SAF), increased sea level
    rise (SLR), temperature changes.'
  6: Climate tipping points affecting temperatures or sea levels.
  7: Climate tipping points increase the overall level of risk in the global economy.
  8: The paper incorporates eight climate tipping points, including permafrost carbon
    feedback, dissociation of ocean methane hydrates, Arctic sea ice loss, dieback
    of the Amazon rainforest, and disintegration of the Greenland and West Antarctic
    Ice Sheets (GIS and WAIS), which increases sea level rise (SLR). Slowdown of the
    Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) modulates the relationship
    between global mean surface temperature and national mean surface temperature.
Drivers_of_Risk:
  4: Tipping points significantly increase the SCC and risk to the world economy,
    affecting income inequality.
Highlights:
  1: Climate tipping points increase the social cost of carbon and increase global
    economic risk.
  2: Climate tipping points, especially ocean methane hydrates dissociation and permafrost
    carbon feedback, significantly increase the social cost of carbon. The increase
    in SCC due to ice sheet disintegration may be underestimated.
  3: Climate tipping points, when considered collectively, significantly increase
    the expected SCC. Interactions between tipping points can be both positive and
    negative, offsetting each other to some extent. High risk aversion amplifies the
    impact of tipping points on the SCC. The AMOC slowdown and SAF weakening tipping
    points may decrease the SCC.
  4: Tipping points increase the SCC for almost all countries and significantly raise
    global consumption risk.
  5: Climate tipping points increase both temperature and SLR. Country-level impacts
    vary based on factors like latitude, coastal populations, and temperature relative
    to optimal levels. The inclusion of tipping points significantly alters the SCC.
  6: Climate tipping points are modeled to impact temperature and sea-level rise (SLR),
    and these impacts are quantified in terms of changes in world consumption per
    capita.
  7: Climate tipping points increase the expected SCC due to risk aversion and have
    implications for financial markets; economic costs increase almost everywhere.
  8: The paper incorporates tipping points into an integrated assessment model (IAM)
    to assess climate change impacts. It provides estimates of the SCC considering
    these tipping points. Variability of the Indian summer monsoon directly affects
    GDP per capita in India.
Methodology:
  1: Uses a meta-analytic integrated assessment model (IAM) with a modular structure.
    The model includes national-level climate damages from rising temperatures and
    sea levels for 180 countries, calibrated on detailed econometric evidence and
    simulation modeling.
  3: The analysis uses integrated assessment models (IAMs) and Monte Carlo simulations
    (10,000 draws) to estimate the SCC under different climate scenarios (RCP4.5-SSP2).
    It explores the impact of parametric uncertainty, including the pure rate of time
    preference and the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption, on the SCC.  It
    also employs a flexible specification of climate damages that allows for impacts
    on the level or growth rate of economic activity.
  4: The analysis uses a meta-analytic IAM and Monte Carlo simulations to estimate
    changes in the SCC and consumption per capita based on tipping points.
  5: Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) with Monte Carlo simulations (sample size is
    10,000 with 0.1% trimmed) using RCP4.5-SSP2 emissions and GDP/population growth
    scenarios, Hope and Schaefer PCF, Whiteman et al. beta OMH, and IPSL AMOC hosing.
  6: 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations under each of the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios,
    sampled on a decadal interval (2020, 2030,...2200).
  7: Meta-analytic IAM using RCP/SSP database, modeled CO2 and CH4 emissions, and
    FAIR model for carbon cycle.
  8: The study uses a simulation model and Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the
    Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). The model incorporates tipping point modules to represent
    the impacts of various climate tipping points. The SCC is estimated by comparing
    welfare outcomes in model runs with and without an additional pulse of emissions.
More Notes:
  1: The authors present a reduced-form tipping points damage function that could
    be incorporated in other IAMs.
  2: The study acknowledges that the included tipping points and impact channels are
    not exhaustive, suggesting that the overall impact could be an underestimate.
    National-level damages are considered.
  3: The sensitivity analysis explores the impact of different emissions scenarios
    and socioeconomic pathways on the SCC. The paper uses the MERGE IAM to account
    for nonmarket damages from climate change. The impact of ocean methane hydrates
    on SCC is sensitive to the amount of methane released in the model's scenarios.
  5: The paper provides a reduced-form climate tipping points damage function that
    could be integrated in other IAMs. Disintegration of the GIS and WAIS primarily
    affects countries with low-lying coastal populations. AMOC slowdown benefits Europe,
    while parts of central Asia see increased climate damages.
  6: The study synthesizes existing literature to develop a more quantitative understanding
    of the economic impacts of climate tipping points.

More_Notes:
  4: The paper suggests that high-latitude countries may see net benefits from climate
    change, while the SCC is unequally distributed, impacting economic inequality.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Social cost of carbon (SCC) is increased by climate tipping points.
  2: The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), which represents the economic cost of emitting
    one additional ton of CO2.
  3: Changes in the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) are used as a proxy for economic costs
    associated with climate change, particularly related to tipping points.
  5: Welfare losses (reduced consumption per capita), changes in the Social Cost of
    Carbon (SCC).
  6: Change in world consumption per capita due to tipping points, relative to world
    consumption per capita without climate damages.
  7: Finds that climate tipping points increase economic costs almost everywhere.
  8: The model estimates the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). GDP per capita in India
    is directly affected by the variability of the Indian summer monsoon.
Outcomes_of_Interest:
  4: The SCC varies by country, with poorer, hotter regions having higher SCCs, indicating
    macroeconomic impacts by region.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Climate tipping points increase the social cost of carbon (SCC) by \u223C25%\
    \ in the main specification. There is an\u223C10% chance of climate tipping points\
    \ more than doubling the SCC."
  2: Combining all eight tipping points increases the expected SCC by 24.5%. The median
    percentage increase in the SCC from all tipping points combined is 18.8%; the
    75th percentile is 22.5%, and the 99.5th percentile is 132.2%. Dissociation of
    ocean methane hydrates increases the expected SCC by 13.1%, and the permafrost
    carbon feedback increases it by 8.4%. Disintegration of the WAIS increases the
    expected SCC by 2.9%. Disintegration of the GIS increases the expected SCC by
    1.8%. Variability of the Indian summer monsoon increases the expected SCC by 1.3%.
    Dieback of the Amazon rainforest leads to a modest 0.1% increase. Slowdown of
    the AMOC reduces the expected SCC by 1.4%. The Surface Albedo Feedback (SAF) reduces
    the expected SCC by 1.7%.
  3: The table provides specific SCC values (in 2020 US$/tCO2) and percentage changes
    in the SCC due to individual and combined tipping points; for example, including
    all tipping points results in an expected SCC of $64.80/tCO2, a 24.5% increase.
    The figure shows the percentage change in SCC due to individual tipping points
    (PCF, OMH, SAF, AMAZ, GIS, WAIS, AMOC, and ISM) and their distribution.
  5: "Tipping points reduce global consumption per capita by around 1% upon 3\xB0\
    C warming and by around 1.4% upon 6\xB0C warming, based on a second-order polynomial\
    \ \uFB01t of the data. In some runs, damages exceed 4%. 2\xB0C warming in the\
    \ absence of tipping points corresponds to 2.3\xB0C warming in the presence of\
    \ tipping points. Some model runs, tipping points add as much as 1.5\xB0C additional\
    \ warming. Linear fit of the data implies 61% more SLR at any given level. Maps\
    \ show country-level expected SCC estimates (2020 US dollars) without tipping\
    \ points and the percentage change in the expected country-level SCC due to all\
    \ tipping points."
  6: The scatterplots show the relationship between 'GMST change without tipping points'
    and 'Additional GMST change due to tipping points' (with a fitted equation y =
    0.23x - 0.03x^2), 'SLR without tipping points' and 'Additional SLR from tipping
    points' (with a fitted equation y = 0.81x), and 'Global tipping point changes
    on ice loss costs' and 'Additional tipping point changes' (with a fitted equation
    y = 0.48x - 0.04x^2).
  8: The elasticity of marginal utility of consumption is triangularly distributed
    with a minimum of 0.5, mode of 1.5, and maximum of 2. The pure rate of time preference
    is triangularly distributed with a minimum of 0.1%, mode of 1%, and maximum of
    2%. The SCC is calculated as the scaled difference in welfare between two model
    runs (one with an additional pulse of emissions in 2020) per ton of CO2 emissions.
    Each run typically involves a Monte Carlo simulation with a sample size of 10,000.
Quantitative_material:
  4: The expected increase in SCC due to climate tipping points is 42.8%, with a 95%
    confidence interval of -0.3% to +186%.
