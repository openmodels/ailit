Drivers of Risk:
  3: Intensifying coastal hazards (shoreline erosion, storm flooding, sea-level rise),
    increasing population density and infrastructural development in coastal zones.
  6: Sea-level rise and coastal erosion rates are identified as external forcing factors
    that can destabilize dynamical attractors for barrier islands.
  7: Climate change impacts leading to the need for potential divestment from and
    abandonment of developed barrier islands; development pressures and the evolution
    of natural barrier-island sites; unidirectional treatment of cause and effect
    in understanding coastal system evolution.
  10: Erosion rate, economic value associated with beach width, fixed costs of nourishment
    projects, storminess, wave climate, sea-level rise.
  11: Increasing cost of nourishment (indexed as the price of sand per unit volume),
    disparities in property values among series of towns alongshore.
  12: Rising sea levels, removal of government subsidies for beach nourishment, spatially
    myopic beach nourishment decisions.
  16: Sea level rise, storm behavior (erosion rates, storm impacts, storm recurrence
    intervals), belief in climate-change predictions, price volatility
  18: Rates of sea level rise (3 mm/yr 'calm' and 10 mm/yr 'worst-case'); Mean storm
    surge magnitude.
  19: 'Percent increase in mean storm surge magnitude, sea-level rise (two scenarios:
    ''worst-case'' and ''calm''), nourishment subsidy rates.'
  20: Sea-level rise, Individual perceptions of environmental change (belief in science-based
    forecasts).
  21: Sea-level rise rates, storm surge size, rate of nourishment subsidy, belief
    in forward looking models ('science-based' forecasts).
  22: Shoreline erosion from sea-level rise and storm events of differing severity,
    in which overwash, driven by storm surge, causes barrier erosion and property
    damage.
  23: Shocks impacting outcomes include storm damage to hotels, which can lead to
    sections of the barrier being abandoned and returning to an 'undeveloped' state
    until profitability is projected.
  26: Gradual, incremental interventions; massive geoengineering works; incremental
    hazard defenses; hazard defenses designed for very long time scales; filtering
    out frequent, minor hazard events.
Highlights:
  3: Hazard and risk are increasing for developed barrier islands worldwide. Coastal
    management interventions to reduce risk often have unintended consequences and
    complex feedbacks.
  6: The developed coastal systems may evolve into dynamical states, termed 'attractors',
    characterized by high-density infrastructure, high property value, and significant
    investment in mitigation practices. These attractors are likely to become unstable
    as sea-level rise and coastal erosion increase.
  7: Traditional approaches treat human activity or physical change as unidirectional
    causes and effects, which is insufficient for understanding the coupled dynamics
    of developed coastlines. The paper aims to elaborate on beach nourishment as a
    specific linking mechanism in the coupled dynamics of developed barrier islands.
  10: Optimal beach nourishment cycles can be determined by balancing erosion rate,
    beach width value, and nourishment project costs to maximize net economic benefits
    for coastal towns.
  11: Potential for a runaway feedback of nourishment frequency increasing with nourishment
    cost, potentially catalyzing an 'arms race' for beach nourishment resources. Inequity
    in the efficacy of coastal towns with differing property values due to the same
    feedback.
  12: Spatially myopic nourishment decisions by individual towns can destabilize long-term
    coastline behavior, leading to chaotic evolution and potentially affecting property
    values.
  16: Informed property owners initially invest heavily in defensive measures but
    eventually abandon coastal real estate due to price volatility.
  18: Time to abandonment is reduced as storm magnitude increases under both sea-level-rise
    scenarios; The amount of damage that occurs prior to abandonment increases significantly
    with larger increases in mean storm surge magnitude; The amount of damage is not
    a strong function of the rate of sea-level rise.
  19: Increased beach nourishment subsidies increase the time to abandonment and the
    amount of damage prior to abandonment.
  20: Increasing belief in science-based projections, especially when sea-level rise
    is high, causes both time to abandonment and damage to decrease.
  21: The timing of systemic instability is controlled by a range of forcing factors
    (physical, policy, and psychological) beyond just sea-level rise rates.
  22: Long-term dynamics of developed coastlines and coastal-resort economies over
    centuries may reveal boom and bust cycles.
  23: The model predicts an emergent boom-and-bust pattern in the dynamic behavior
    of a developed barrier island due to cycles of resort development, coastal defense,
    and economic collapse.
  26: Hazard defenses can buffer human enterprise from natural variability, but incrementally
    evolving defenses may be reactionary. Massive hazard defenses may decouple the
    system, leading to vulnerability to infrequent, major events due to filtering
    out of frequent, minor events.
Methodology:
  3: Mainstream economics defines risk as the likelihood of a hazard event multiplied
    by the value of susceptible assets and infrastructure.
  6: The analysis uses a human-landscape coupling framework, considering the interplay
    of fluvial, oceanic, or atmospheric processes, market processes, and human activities
    on barrier islands.
  7: The chapter elaborates on beach nourishment as a linking mechanism in the coupled
    dynamics of developed barrier islands.

    simulate the effects of nourishment decisions on property values and coastline
    evolution.

More Notes:
  3: The paper focuses on barrier islands, which constitute a significant portion
    of the global coastline, particularly in the United States.
  7: The paper emphasizes the need for a more holistic coastal management perspective
    and questions how society may adapt to coastal change, either through abandonment
    or reinforcement of economic drivers intensifying coastal development.
  11: The analysis is based on a simplified coastal system and explores how optimized
    utility changes with external conditions to reveal insight into its functional
    dependence on environmental forcing. The approach doesn't explicitly simulate
    all dynamics, but focuses on the emergent state of optimized nourishment intervals.
