Drivers of Risk:
  2: Supply shocks (salvage logging after disturbance like windthrow or bark beetle
    outbreak), demand changes, international trade, voluntary logging, changes in
    composition of harvested roundwood assortments.
  3: Product unit value (demand shocks), salvage logging (supply shocks), roundwood
    imports, roundwood exports, voluntary logging, assortment share
Highlights:
  2: The study aims to identify predictors of roundwood price resilience with respect
    to supply and demand shocks and to find the extent to which their effect varies
    across national forest-based value chains in Europe.
  3: Demand shocks increase roundwood prices. Supply shocks (salvage logging) reduce
    roundwood prices. The effect of demand/supply shocks can be mitigated or reinforced
    by other factors (imports, exports, voluntary logging, assortment share).
Methodology:
  2: Time series econometric model for two forest-based value chains (saw milling,
    pulp milling) in five EU countries (Austria, Czechia, Germany, Finland and Sweden).
  3: OLS (ordinary least squares) estimation of the effect of potential variables;
    theory of derived demand and price transmission between market levels
More Notes:
  2: The study explicitly includes voluntary logging, which is often ignored in other
    studies.
  3: The analysis focuses on the effect of various factors on roundwood prices. Changes
    in roundwood storage cannot be included in the analysis due to lack of data availability.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Roundwood price stability is critical for the functioning of forest-based value
    chains.
  3: Roundwood prices (106 LCU/106 m3)
Quantitative material:
  3: Table 2 provides the expected direction (sign) of the effect of each explanatory
    variable on roundwood prices.
