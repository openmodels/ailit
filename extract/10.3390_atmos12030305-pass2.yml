Drivers of Risk:
  1: Projected climate-change scenarios.
  2: Climate change scenarios (reduced precipitation, glacial shrinkage, salinization,
    desertification) affecting agricultural productivity and land suitability.
  3: Changes in relative net incomes per hectare of different land-use activities
    due to climate change scenarios, mainly influenced by yield changes from varying
    temperature and precipitation.
  4: "Projected climatic changes and variations in water availability; Climate-change\
    \ scenarios based on the IPCC\u2019s A2 (severe) and B2 (moderate) emission projections\
    \ for 2040 and 2070."
  6: No relevant information
  7: Climate change, specifically moderate (B240, B270) and severe (A240, A270) scenarios
    derived from the Hadley Centre Coupled Model.
  8: Climate change scenarios (A240, B240, A270, B270) affecting land use and crop
    yields.
  9: Climate change, water stress, changes in crop productivity.
  10: Climate change scenarios (A240, B240, A270, B270) leading to changes in rainfall
    levels and suitability of land for wheat cultivation.
  11: Climate change, specifically increasing water scarcity in the northern geographic
    zones.
  12: Climate change, mitigation/substitution actions of farmers, changes in the relative
    profitability of crops.
  13: Anticipated climate change, water availability (especially irrigation), shift
    in agroclimatic zones.
  14: Climate change (moderate and severe scenarios); Changes in temperature and precipitation;
    Reductions in irrigation
  15: Climate change impacts on crop production in Chile; Changes in international
    markets and comparative advantages; Unanticipated effects of climate change.
Highlights:
  1: Climate change impacts will be mitigated by land-use adaptation, with main export-earning
    crops tending to move south; agricultural employment will decrease under all climate
    change scenarios; forestry and agriculture would likely suffer a loss in net-income
    generation under severe climate-change scenarios.
  2: Climate change is likely to affect the agriculture sector by leading to the salinization
    and desertification of agricultural lands in northern and central Chile, potentially
    leading to welfare implications; Farmers will adapt resource use to what they
    perceive to be the most profitable activity.
  3: Adaptability of farmers and mitigation effects of land-use responses underline
    the importance of welfare considerations and resilience to climate changes.
  4: The study simulates land allocation under different climate scenarios, projecting
    prices of non-tradable goods based on estimated price flexibilities applied to
    projected production levels.
  6: No relevant information
  7: Annual crops and fruit plantations decline in land area in the near term (2040),
    while pastures/forage and forest plantations increase. By 2070, field crops and
    fruits recuperate somewhat, but pastures/forage decline further, and forestry
    becomes increasingly important. Table grapes face significant land losses under
    all scenarios, while avocados expand.
  8: Severe climate change scenarios lead to significant losses in net income for
    the agriculture and forestry sectors, particularly impacting fruit production.
    Moderate climate change scenarios may result in a slight increase in income over
    the baseline. Changes in land use such as shifts toward certain crops, may partially
    mitigate these negative impacts.
  9: Aggregate net income decreases under scenarios A240 and A270, but increases or
    remains stable under B240 and B270. Aggregate farm labor demand decreases in all
    climate change scenarios, with the largest decline (18%) under the A270 scenario.
  10: The surface area of land used for rainfed wheat declines overall under all climate
    change scenarios. There is a projected southward shift in climate conditions suitable
    for wheat cultivation. Northern regions experience large proportional decreases
    in wheat land, while the southernmost region (Los Lagos) shows an increase. The
    regions that currently concentrate wheat production observe declines in land use
    by 2040, with a partial recovery by 2070.
  11: Climate change is expected to significantly impact land area used for wheat
    and table grapes, leading to a geographic shift in agricultural activity. Table
    grape land area is projected to decline between 21% and 47% depending on the severity
    of the climate-change scenario. There is a shift in table grape activity from
    the northern arid zones to the south.
  12: Climate change is projected to lead to an increase in the total national area
    planted with avocados.
  13: Decision-makers adapt to changing climate conditions by adjusting their portfolios
    of activities; shift in agroclimatic zones preserves, in part, the overall composition
    of production; land-use substitution can offset or mitigate the effects of climate
    change.
  14: Aggregate impacts of anticipated climate change on Chilean agriculture activities
    will likely be relatively small due to the flexibility of farmers and landowners
    to adapt; Climate changes are projected to shift agroclimatic zones in a way that
    moves southward the climate conditions beneficial for activities currently more
    concentrated in the north.
  15: Climate change will likely bring some losses to various communities linked to
    agriculture in Chile. Taking advantage of new opportunities in favored sectors
    and agroclimatic zones will require investments appropriate to local climates.
Methodology:
  1: A farmland allocation model with associated labor employment at the municipal
    level driven by expected relative net incomes per hectare, constructed from local
    average per-hectare yields, regional average output prices and per-hectare production
    cost estimates. The sensitivities of cropland allocation to relative net-income
    changes were estimated using historical land allocations at the municipal level
    derived from the last two Chilean Agricultural Censuses. Analysis of projected
    climate-change scenarios in 2040 and 2070.
  2: "Modeling farmers\u2019 land allocations as a consequence of individual-level\
    \ decisions based on the estimated relative profitability of activities in agroclimatic\
    \ zones under climate change scenarios; Land and labor are allocated to field\
    \ crops, plantation crops, pastures, and forestry."
  3: The analysis uses a model of land allocations at the municipal level based on
    expected relative net incomes per hectare, using historical data and climate scenarios
    projections.
  4: "Simulation approach to projecting the consequences for land use of possible\
    \ climate regimes, considering per-hectare crop productivity altered by projected\
    \ climatic changes and variations in water availability. Uses standardized crop\
    \ budgets generated by Agrogesti\xF3n (Fundaci\xF3n Chile), the Ministry of Agriculture,\
    \ and the Department of Agriculture Economics at the Catholic University of Chile\
    \ [31]. Agronomic simulation models used to project future expected yield performance\
    \ for each crop, also accounting for water availability constraints [32]."
  6: The analysis uses relative share simulations for future climate scenarios to
    allocate agricultural and forestry land based on calculated net incomes per crop
    using historical data.
  7: The analysis projects land use based on expected profitability of activities,
    using the 2020 climate state as a base. Farmer decisions are modeled to determine
    land allocation based on expected conditions, prior to the realization of the
    future climate state. The results are applicable to Chile.
  8: Analysis of land use changes under different climate scenarios and their impact
    on net income for various agricultural activities and forestry.
  9: Simulation of agricultural activity under different climate change scenarios
    (A240, A270, B240, B270) using real price and cost data from 2007. Labor demand
    is calculated based on per-hectare technical requirements, yield sensitivity,
    and farm activities linked to pastures. Labor demand is translated into year-employment
    equivalents (full-time workers working 44 hours/week).
  10: The analysis uses data based on pre-2015 regional definitions in Chile. It projects
    changes in land use for rainfed wheat under different climate change scenarios
    for the years 2040 (A240, B240) and 2070 (A270, B270), comparing them to a baseline
    from the census year 2007. The climate scenarios are not defined in this page.
    The regions are stacked vertically, allowing for comparisons.
  12: The analysis projects the impact of climate change on avocado yields at the
    municipal level and considers the mitigation/substitution actions of farmers.
  13: Analysis of land use changes under moderate and severe climate change scenarios,
    projected to 2070.
  14: Simulation model assessing the impact of climate change on Chilean agriculture
    activities; Ricardian model of self-reported land values; Optimization algorithm
    for land allocations; The analysis considers farmer adaptability and land-use
    responses.
  15: Simulation model projecting land-use changes based on climate scenarios and
    crop production data. Model assumes farmer decisions are long term and based on
    a known climate state. Ceteris paribus analysis.
More Notes:
  2: "The analysis uses locally scaled simulations based on the Hadley Center\u2019\
    s Precis model; The land-use projections were limited by the ceteris paribus assumption\
    \ that other factors remain roughly unchanged in the future."
  3: The analysis does not provide specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes like
    GDP effects or public expenditure changes.
  4: The study assumes a constant amount of agricultural and forestry land at the
    municipal level, unchanged real prices of tradable goods, and sets aside potential
    changes to government policy and other factors that might influence land allocations
    and rural labor demand.
  6: No relevant information
  7: The paper mentions that farm system investments involve unrecoverable fixed costs,
    creating inertia in land-use changes.
  8: The analysis distinguishes between severe (A240 and A270) and moderate (B240
    and B270) climate change scenarios. The time horizons considered are 2040 and
    2070.
  9: The analysis focuses on the agricultural sector and its sub-sectors. Land allocation
    shifts between activities (e.g., from fruits to field crops or forestry) in response
    to climate change impacts on productivity. Results are based on 2007 USD.
  10: The inclusion of table grapes as a line item in national accounts suggests that
    changes in agricultural production are considered relevant macroeconomic indicators
    in Chile.  The paper focuses on the geographic distribution of climate change
    impacts within Chile.
  12: The study considers both direct climate change impacts on yields and indirect
    impacts via farmer responses to changing crop profitability. The results suggest
    that avocado cultivation expands both northward and southward from the central
    zone of Chile.
  13: The study focuses on Chile and its agricultural sector, particularly concerning
    land use changes and employment under climate change scenarios.
  14: The results cannot reflect the full range of possible changes at the level of
    communities and individual farmer households; There are significant changes at
    the regional, subnational level.
  15: "The model does not account for dynamic adaptation, changes in international\
    \ prices, technologies, or trade agreements. Future work should incorporate a\
    \ political\u2013economic model of possible land policy changes."

    Changes in land values
  15: Losses to communities linked to agriculture in Chile due to climate change.
Quantitative material:
  1: Agricultural employment will decrease in all the climate-change scenarios.
  2: Primary production of agriculture and forestry sectors accounts for approximately
    3% of Chile's GDP; Agriculture employs approximately 12% of the total national
    workforce; Primary and processed agricultural/forestry products represent about
    15% to 20% of Chile's annual merchandise export earnings.
  6: No relevant information
  7: The paper provides quantitative projections of land use changes (in hectares
    and percentages) for annual crops, fruit plantations, pastures and forage lands,
    and forestry land under different climate scenarios (2040 and 2070) relative to
    a baseline.
  8: Agriculture and forestry sectors will suffer losses in net income in both the
    shorter and longer terms in the severe climate-change scenarios (A240 and A270).
    Net revenues will decrease by 5 percent in 2040 from the baseline, and by 14 percent
    by 2070. Fruit net revenues are expected to decline by 76 percent in the long
    term, under the severe-change scenario (A270), while the moderate-change scenario
    will produce a decline of 31 percent.
  9: 'Table 2: Net income (millions of 2007 USD) under climate scenarios A240, A270,
    B240, B270 compared to Baseline, for Field crops, Fruits, Pastures and forage,
    and Forestry. Table 3: Number of employee-years (thousands) under climate scenarios
    A240, A270, B240, B270 compared to Baseline, for Field crops, Fruits, Pasture
    and forage, and Forestry.'
  10: Table 4 provides quantitative data on the land area (in hectares) under rainfed
    wheat by region and climate change scenario (Baseline, A240, B240, A270, B270).  The
    total land area decreases by 31% under A240 and B240 scenarios, and decreases
    by 17% under the B270 scenario.  Some regions see decreases in wheat land of over
    90% under the A270 scenario. Los Lagos sees an increase in land with wheat cultivation.
  11: Projected changes in land area (hectares) under wheat and table grapes under
    different climate change scenarios by 2070; Table 5 provides specific land area
    (hectares) data for table grapes by region and climate scenario (Baseline, A240/B240,
    A270, B270).
  12: 'Table 6 provides the area planted with avocados by region and climate-change
    scenario (hectares). For example, the total area increases from 39,760 hectares
    at baseline to almost 50,000 hectares in the most severe climate-change scenario
    (A270 in 2070: 49,412 hectares, and B270 in 2070: 56,409 hectares).'
  13: Under the moderate-change scenario, the land area devoted to fruit increases
    by slightly over 5 percent; total land use for field crops declines slightly in
    the most severe change scenario; land with field crops would increase by over
    four percent in the moderate climate-change scenario; longer-term avocado plantings
    expand even more, to 56,000 hectares.
  14: "Severe climate-change scenario leads to slight declines in total agricultural\
    \ net-income; Moderate climate-change scenario increases total agricultural net-income;\
    \ A 2.5\xB0C increase in mean temperature and a 10 percent decrease in precipitation\
    \ would increase land values by 40 percent for medium and large farmers and have\
    \ almost no effect for small farmers; Overall reduction of 2.7 percent in net\
    \ income at the national level under the severe A2 climate scenario for 2040."
