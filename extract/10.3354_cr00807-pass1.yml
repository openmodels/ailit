Drivers of Risk:
  1: Decreasing trend in precipitation.
  2: Rainfall changes and increasing precipitation in the Pampas are contributing
    to changes in land use patterns, agricultural expansion, and heightened concerns
    about future climate variability.
  5: Rainfall decrease.
  7: Decadal climate variability, specifically drier conditions towards the end of
    the simulated sequence.
  8: Decreasing precipitation trends; Changes in rainfall; Higher radiation levels;
    Decreases in minimum temperatures; Water becoming a limiting resource.
  9: Decreasing precipitation.
  10: Decreasing rainfall trends, particularly impacting climatically marginal regions;
    climate variability; limited adoption of adaptation strategies; trade-offs between
    productivity, stability, and sustainability in agroecosystems
Highlights:
  1: Decreased precipitation may significantly impact marginal agricultural regions
    (Pilar) more than productive regions (Pergamino). Adaptation can mitigate some
    negative impacts.
  5: Quantifies the impacts of rainfall decrease on current agricultural practices
    and explores adaptive responses by hypothetically modelling farmer decisions about
    land allocation.
  7: The analysis quantifies the impact of climate variability on production income
    and the probability of negative economic returns for key crops in the Pampas region.
  8: Decreasing precipitation trends had quite different impacts on the economic profits
    of current practices at each location; profits in Pilar showed a clear reduction
    while profits for summer crops in Pergamino changed only slightly; the risk of
    economic losses (PNER) increased substantially in Pilar due to climate change,
    while it remained close to zero in Pergamino.
  9: Adaptation, even delayed, is better than no adaptation in maintaining farm-wide
    economic returns and stabilizing the probability of negative returns in Pilar.
  10: Decreasing rainfall can lead to economic losses for farmers, particularly in
    climatically marginal regions like Pilar; Adaptation strategies, even delayed
    ones, can help reduce the negative impacts; Climatically marginal regions are
    more sensitive to changes; Unfavorable climate trends may endanger future viability
    of continuous agriculture in marginal regions.
Methodology:
  1: Assess the potential impacts of a plausible decreasing trend in precipitation
    on the economic sustainability of 2 contrasting agricultural systems (Pergamino
    and Pilar) using crop models and exploring adaptation options. The time scale
    is decades.
  2: The analysis uses historical climate records to define plausible future climate
    scenarios, employs a semi-parametric weather generator for downscaling, and simulates
    agricultural outcomes using crop growth models and economic inputs.
  5: Dynamic, process-level crop models (DSSAT) simulate crop growth and development.
    Economic profits per hectare are computed as the difference between gross income
    (simulated yields * median crop prices from 2000-2005) and costs (direct and indirect).
    PNER is computed as the proportion of simulations with negative economic profits.
    This is applicable for the Pampas region.
  7: "Crop models are used to simulate profits for different cropping cycles under\
    \ varying weather realizations. Three adaptive responses are simulated: a 'na\xEF\
    ve' farmer, a 'clairvoyant' farmer, and a farmer who adapts based on the previous\
    \ 4 cycles. Optimal land allocations are identified using a genetic algorithm."

    under climate change scenarios; Consideration of Crop Production Theory (CPT)
    value function; Simulation of crop yields and profits over a 24-year sequence;
    Exhaustive search procedure for validation.
  9: Simulation of farmer adaptation strategies (instant, 4-year delayed, and no adaptation)
    to climate conditions over cropping cycles (5-24) in Pilar, Argentina.
  10: "Simulation of farmer adaptation strategies (na\xEFve, clairvoyant, delayed)\
    \ to decreasing precipitation, assessing impacts on profits and economic risks\
    \ in Pilar and Pergamino; the results presented only cover two locations within\
    \ Argentina and are applicable for decadal climate variability given technological\
    \ innovations."
More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on the Pampas region of Argentina.
  5: The study assumes a constant economic context (crop prices and input costs) to
    isolate the effects of changing climate.
  7: The study focuses on farm-level adaptation strategies rather than nation-wide
    adaptation. The adaptive responses considered include changes in land allocation.
  9: The analysis focuses on two locations in the Pampas (Pilar and Pergamino), but
    only results for Pilar are discussed on this page. In Pergamino, there are no
    marked differences in profits or economic risks between the adaptation and no
    adaptation situations.
  10: The study acknowledges the role of technological innovation (e.g., drought-tolerant
    crops) as an adaptation measure; it highlights the need for salient scientific
    knowledge to inform decision-making and policy.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Economic returns of crop production; farm profits; production risks.
  5: Economic profits per hectare, Probability of Negative Economic Returns (PNER).
  7: Production income ($/ha) and probability of negative production incomes.
  8: Annual economic profits for different crop/management conditions; Crop Production;
    Risk of economic losses (PNER).
  9: Farm-wide economic returns, probability of negative farm-wide economic returns
    (a metric of production risk).
  10: Economic losses and lower profits for farmers due to decreasing rainfall; viability
    of continuous agriculture in marginal regions
Quantitative material:
  1: Crop economic returns in Pergamino would not change noticeably with decreased
    precipitation; Pilar would experience a marked decrease in profits and an increase
    in production risks with decreased precipitation.
  5: "Projected annual precipitation totals in Pilar are shown in Fig. 3, with a proposed\
    \ decreasing trend of -6.6 mm/year. Cost calculations are based on a representative\
    \ 600 ha farm operated by its owner with indirect costs assumed to be $70 ha\u2013\
    1 for both locations."
  7: Figure 4 shows the temporal evolution of economic returns and the probability
    of negative economic returns for soybean, maize, and wheat/soybean cropping systems
    in Pergamino and Pilar regions.
  8: "Wheat/soybean double crop in Pilar started with an average profit of about $80\
    \ ha\u20131 and reached average profits close to zero by the end of the 24 yr\
    \ sequence; Maize in Pilar decreased in economic returns to 75% of the initial\
    \ value by the end of the 24 yr sequence; Soybean in Pilar average economic returns\
    \ decreased to about 40 % of the initial value; Income assumed to be $170 ha\u2013\
    1 ($230 ha\u20131) for Pilar (Pergamino); PNER for maize in Pilar increased from\
    \ 0.15 to 0.55 throughout the 24 yr sequence; PNER for full-cycle soybean in Pilar\
    \ rose from 0.05 to 0.20; The chance of negative profits for the wheat/soybean\
    \ double crop in Pilar increased from 0.35 to 0.65."
  9: Figure 5 displays the temporal evolution of farm-wide economic returns and the
    probability of negative farm-wide economic returns under different adaptation
    strategies. In the absence of adaptation, the probability of economic failure
    increases rapidly with decreasing precipitation, reaching about 0.35 towards the
    end of the sequence (initially around 0.20).
  10: "Simulated yield decreases for maize in Pilar range from 76 to 93 kg ha\u2013\
    1 yr\u20131; Projected decreases in full-cycle soybean yields in Pilar are 20\
    \ to 25 kg ha\u20131 yr\u20131; Wheat/soybean economic losses double from once\
    \ in 3 yr to twice in 3 yr; Maize economic losses shift from once every 6 or 7\
    \ yr to 5 of 10 yr in Pilar"
