Drivers of Risk:
  3: Atmospheric CO2 and the concurrent ocean acidification.
  14: Ocean acidification; Increased atmospheric CO2; Ocean warming.
  15: Ocean acidification, erosion, warming, and other disturbances affect coral reefs.
  16: Ocean acidification impacts vermetid and shellfish reefs, potentially impacting
    their ability to stabilize sediments, provide habitat, and store organic carbon.
    Ocean acidification, trampling, sedimentation, dredging, and pollutants or poisons
    impact vermetid and shellfish reefs. Reduced biodiversity associated with acidified
    conditions decreases ecosystem resilience and compromises regulating services,
    including habitat provision, nutrient cycling, and carbon storage.
  19: Ocean acidification impacting aquaculture, fisheries, shoreline protection,
    and other valuable marine ecosystem services.
  26: Ocean acidification and warming; Coastal acidification
Highlights:
  3: Improved understanding is urgently needed on ocean acidification impacts from
    scientific, management, policy, and socioeconomic perspectives to develop adequate
    adaptation strategies.
  14: Ocean acidification causes decreases in bivalve reproduction, survival of juvenile
    bivalves, or delayed maturation of adults and can alter recruitment, harvestable
    biomass, maximum sustainable yield, and economic value of shellfish fisheries.
  15: Southeast Asia is at particular combined risk of reef loss from warming and
    acidification, combined with social and economic vulnerability.
  19: Ocean acidification impacts aquaculture, fisheries, shoreline protection, and
    other valuable marine ecosystem services, resulting in vulnerabilities and risks
    to human communities; both global CO2 emission reductions and local adaptation
    strategies are needed.
  26: Ocean acidification has economic consequences for commercial fisheries, shellfish
    production, and aquaculture.
Methodology:
  3: Review of scientific literature, building from synthesis efforts in journal special
    issues and national and international scientific assessments.
  14: Models with simple CO2-damage relationships for all bivalves and time discounting
    have been used; Studies with varying degrees of complexity examine potential economic
    losses.
  15: The page discusses the use of both economic and non-economic methods to evaluate
    risks from changes in coral reef health and coverage.
  26: Integrated assessment modeling for helping the United States sea scallop fishery
    plan ahead for ocean acidification and warming (Cooley et al., 2015).
More Notes:
  14: The paper acknowledges that some impacts, like alterations in taste or behavior
    changes in finfish, haven't been incorporated into models yet.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: "Impacts on human society\u2014for fishery and resource management, marine conservation,\
    \ and impacts on communities reliant on the ocean."
  14: Economic losses from shellfish harvest decreases; Welfare losses related to
    shellfish demand changes; Employment losses in shellfish and finfish sectors.
  15: 'Losses of coral reef-provided ecosystem services: coastal protection, habitat
    and biodiversity, fisheries, recreational and tourism opportunities, and existence
    and amenity values.'
  16: "Oyster reefs provide an estimated value of $5,500\u2013$99,000 per hectare\
    \ per year via shoreline stabilization, habitat creation, and water filtration."
  19: Vulnerabilities and risks to human communities from impacts on aquaculture,
    fisheries, shoreline protection, and other valuable marine ecosystem services.
  26: "Economic impacts of ocean acidification on shellfish fisheries and aquaculture\
    \ in the United Kingdom (Mangi et al., 2018); Economic impact of ocean acidification\
    \ on shellfish production in Europe (Narita & Rehdanz, 2017); Welfare estimates\
    \ of avoided ocean acidification in the U.S. mollusk market (Moore, 2015); Estimating\

Quantitative material:
  14: "Models with simple CO2-damage relationships have projected approximately 10\u2013\
    28% losses for both US and UK mollusk harvests annually."
  15: Without coastal protection from reefs, flood damages from 100-year storm events
    would nearly double, rising to $272 billion.

    \ per year."
  26: Mangi et al. (2018) quantifies the economic impacts of ocean acidification on
    shellfish fisheries and aquaculture in the United Kingdom; Narita et al. (2012)
    and Narita & Rehdanz (2017) quantify economic impacts of ocean acidification on
    shellfish production, globally and in Europe, respectively; Moore (2015) presents
    welfare estimates of avoided ocean acidification in the U.S. mollusk market; Fernandes
    et al. (2017) estimates ecological, economic and social impacts of ocean acidification
    and warming on UK fisheries.
