  31: The Impacts of Ocean Acidification on Marine Ecosystems and Reliant Human Communities
Highlights:
  1: Ocean acidification potentially puts at risk many valuable ecosystem services
    such as fisheries, aquaculture, and shoreline protection.
  3: Ocean acidification impacts seawater chemistry (increased CO2, lower pH, reduced
    carbonate ions), organismal responses, community and ecosystem impacts on food-web
    interactions, and risks to human communities reliant on ocean resources.
  8: Adaptation to high-CO2 conditions is possible, single-factor studies can yield
    incorrect information, ocean acidification should not be considered an isolated
    phenomenon, detecting change in marine species in the environment attributable
    to ocean acidification is limited.
  11: Ocean acidification can disrupt pelagic food webs, potentially leading to increased
    productivity at the base but complex and species-specific effects on upper trophic
    levels. Coral reefs are vulnerable due to declines in net calcification and increased
    bioerosion.
  12: Coral communities potentially shifting to slower-growing or soft corals; adaptation
    in corals to acidification is possible; acidification can reduce structural complexity
    of corals and reefs.
  13: Ocean acidification poses a present-day concern with direct implications for
    businesses and coastal communities, particularly the Pacific oyster industry;
    Ocean acidification is very likely to decrease harvests of several bivalve shellfish
    species, with lost revenue and cultural disruption to follow.
  15: Ocean acidification can lead to substantial decline in US northeast sea scallop
    harvests and a decrease in the Alaska-based southern Tanner crab fishery catch
    and profits. Total fisheries revenue in the Arctic region may increase due to
    poleward movement of temperate fisheries. Decreased pH in the California Current
    is expected to most impact crabs, shrimps, benthic grazers, and bivalves. Without
    reefs, flood damages from 100-year storm events would nearly double.
  16: Ocean acidification impacts vermetid and shellfish reefs, submerged aquatic
    vegetation, and coastal systems. Loss of biodiversity can decrease ecosystem resilience
    and regulating functions.
  17: The foremost solution to ocean acidification is to cut atmospheric CO2 emissions.
  18: Key outcomes include the identification of risks to human communities such as
    loss of shellfish harvests and decline in coastal protection by coral reefs.
  19: Ocean acidification will impact aquaculture, fisheries, shoreline protection,
    and other valuable marine ecosystem services, resulting in vulnerabilities and
    risks to human communities.
  22: "Ocean acidification has negative yet variable effects on marine organisms;\
    \ regional adaptation defines sensitivity to future ocean acidification; pteropod\
    \ shell condition and survival are impaired by ocean acidification conditions;\
    \ development of krill larvae is impaired under observed pCO2 levels; species\
    \ exhibit local adaptation to pH conditions; El Ni\xF1o-related thermal stress\
    \ coupled with ocean acidification negatively impacts pteropods."
  25: Ocean acidification can lead to shifts in food web structure, declines in coral
    calcification, increased bioerosion, changes in algal bloom dynamics, impaired
    fish behavior, and alterations in benthic community composition.
  28: Some papers highlight the role of coastal habitats in carbon sequestration and
    storage (blue carbon) and potential for integrating blue carbon into MPA design
    (Howard et al. 2017).
  29: Various management and policy options addressing ocean acidification are discussed,
    emphasizing resilience and adaptation strategies.

    risks, and studying interventions to decrease vulnerability.
  15: Integrated assessment models (IAMs), ecosystem models, and vulnerability assessments
    are used to evaluate the interaction of ocean acidification with other drivers.

    \ CO2 gradients, laboratory experiments manipulating CO2 levels, and \u03BCCT\
    \ analysis of bioerosion."

    alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon (Sippo et al. 2016).
More Notes:
  11: The page emphasizes the complex interactions between ocean acidification and
    other environmental factors, making it difficult to isolate the specific effects
    of acidification. It also highlights the potential for ocean acidification to
    influence the toxicity and abundance of harmful algal blooms.
  12: Ocean acidification's impact on biogenic reefs includes increased dissolution
    rates and altered recruitment which may threaten their structural integrity.
  13: Notes the difficulty of attributing ecosystem service changes to ocean acidification
    due to other stressors and adaptation.
  15: The page highlights the vulnerability of indigenous groups and rural communities
    to losses in shellfish harvests from ocean acidification. The interconnectedness
    of community and environmental factors in mitigating vulnerability is also mentioned.
  17: Existing water quality regulatory policies can help address coastal acidification
    locally. Husbandry of captive or wild species, such as shellfish aquaculture,
    offers intervention opportunities. Just-in-time adaptations, like industry-science
    partnerships in the US Pacific oyster shellfish fishery, can address ocean acidification.
  18: The page emphasizes the need for adaptation in marine governance and management
    practices to address global-scale changes such as acidification and climate change,
    as well as local-scale concerns.
  19: Interventions designed to address other issues (e.g., biodiversity loss, water
    quality, governance) may also help address harm from ocean acidification.
  28: The page contains a number of references to studies on the effects of ocean
    acidification and climate change on marine ecosystems and their services, including
    carbon storage, wave attenuation, and bioremediation.
  29: The text includes broad coverage of ocean systems' impacts within the context
    of climate change, touching on cultural ecosystem services and the role of marine
    protected areas.
  31: This is a table of contents, so only provides an overview of topics covered
    in the review. The review on Ocean Acidification is likely to be highly relevant.
Quantitative material:
  11: The text mentions studies highlighting large declines in the net calcification
    of corals over time and increased net community calcification when seawater carbonate
    saturation states are raised to preindustrial levels. It does not specify the
    original and final values for either.
  13: Implies bivalve shellfish harvest decreases will lead to lost revenue, but does
    not specify numbers.
  15: There is a mention that flood damages from 100-year storm events would nearly
    double, rising to $272 billion without coastal protection from reefs.
  16: "Oyster reefs provide an estimated value of $5,500\u2013$99,000 per hectare\
    \ per year via shoreline stabilization, habitat creation, and water filtration."
  22: Several studies involve quantifying sensitivities and interactions with warming;
    examining the direct effect of seawater pH on survival rate; development is impaired
    under pCO2 levels; serial experimentation reveals complex CO2 x temperature effects.
  25: Several papers provide quantitative data, such as specific changes in calcification
    rates (De'ath et al., 2009; Albright et al., 2016), skeletal density (Mollica
    et al., 2018), and community composition (Inoue et al., 2013; Barkley et al.,
    2015).
  28: Some papers quantify carbon flows and stores in coastal ecosystems (e.g., Luisetti
    et al. 2019 for the UK).
