Drivers of Risk:
  1: "The 1997/98 El Ni\xF1o and positive Indian Ocean Dipole event caused a major\
    \ ecosystem shift in coastal East African waters."
  2: Climate change, unsustainable exploitation of living marine resources, poleward
    redistribution of marine species, changes in coastal upwelling systems.
Highlights:
  1: "The 1997/98 El Ni\xF1o caused a shift in the upwelling system, leading to reduced\
    \ productivity in Kenyan waters and increased productivity in Tanzanian waters,\
    \ with potential economic consequences for fishing communities and food security.\
    \ Satellite observations may assist fisheries management bodies to anticipate\
    \ low productivity periods and mitigate their potentially negative economic impacts."
  2: Changes in upwelling systems, which provide more than 40% of global fish catch,
    can lead to changes in fish abundance, causing conflict and hardship (examples
    include South Africa and eastern Tasmania).
Methodology:
  1: "Combination of remote sensing and ocean modelling to show how a stable seasonal\
    \ upwelling off the Kenyan coast shifted into the territorial waters of neighboring\
    \ Tanzania under the influence of the 1997/98 El Ni\xF1o. Comparison with super\
    \ El-Ni\xF1o events of 1972,73, 1982\u201383 and 2015\u201316."
  2: Remote sensing and modelling of oceanographic conditions (SST, Chlorophyll-a
    concentration) used to assess the impact of climate change on ecosystems.
More Notes:
  2: The North Kenya Bank (NKB) upwelling is a focus of the analysis, with data from
    February 1998 being compared between satellite observations and model simulations.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: "Likely negative impacts on local fish stocks in Kenya, affecting fishers\u2019\
    \ livelihoods and food security, and the temporary increase in pelagic fishery\
    \ species\u2019 productivity in Tanzania are highlighted. Negative economic impacts\
    \ due to low productivity periods."
  2: Food insecurity is likely to grow for East African countries (Kenya, Tanzania)
    due to climate change impacts and poleward redistribution of marine species.
Quantitative material:
  1: "Observed lowest chlorophyll-a over the North Kenya banks (Kenya), while it reached\
    \ its historical maximum off Dar Es Salaam (Tanzanian waters) during the 1997/98\
    \ El Ni\xF1o."
