Drivers of Risk:
  4: Growing acute heat exposure, particularly for older individuals (69+), driven
    by total population growth, demographic changes in the age structure, and heat
    exposure changes.
  5: Climate change (increased heat exposure), population growth, population aging
  7: The drivers of risk are climate change, population growth, and aging.
  8: The paper mentions the urban heat island effect and the vulnerability of older
    populations to heat extremes as risks related to climate change adaptation.
  9: "Three meteorological indicators that vary by SSP scenario: cooling degree days\
    \ (CDD), 95th percentile of daily maximum temperatures (TMax95th), and count of\
    \ days with a dry bulb maximum temperature of 37.5\xB0C (#HD)."
  10: Climate change-driven increases in heat, population changes (age structure,
    population size)
Highlights:
  4: Europe and South America will experience a rise in exposure to heat with Europe
    facing a large increase in its population aged 69+.
  5: Cumulative heat exposure of older individuals will at least triplicate in all
    continents by 2050, irrespective of the scenario. Climate change is the prevailing
    mechanism of change in more temperate nations, while population aging is the defining
    driver in warmer regions. Asia will experience the highest levels of heat exposure
    for older adults.
  7: The decomposition analysis highlights the contributions of climate change, population
    growth, and aging to different measures of heat exposure across regions and globally.
  8: Challenges in addressing needs of large and growing populations of older adults
    in climate change adaptation; recognition of uncertainty in future elderly population
    distribution.
  9: The projected elderly population in 2050 closely aligns with estimates from ref.
    77 for the United States but has a more significant bias in relation to the estimates
    of ref. 78.
  10: Quantifies errors in age-stratified population projections under different climate
    scenarios for several nations/regions
Methodology:
  4: Analysis uses CMIP6 global climate models (excluding 'hot models') to project
    heat exposures (Cooling Degree Days (CDDs), Hot Days (#HD), and acute extreme
    heat exposure (TMAX95)) for aged 69+ individuals under different SSP scenarios
    (SSP1(26), SSP2(45), SSP3(70), and SSP5(85)) for the year 2050, compared to historical
    data.
  5: Uses General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)
    to project future heat exposure, disaggregated by age and region. Compares scenarios
    and current population. Includes uncertainty ranges from GCMs.
  7: The methodology involves a decomposition analysis of projected determinants of
    exposure by region and globally under different SSP scenarios. The results are
    applicable to understanding the contribution of different factors (climate change,
    population growth, and aging) to heat exposure.
  8: The analysis includes age-stratified population projections using gridded data
    aggregated from WorldPop for 2020 and forecast for 2050 under various SSP scenarios.
  9: Downscales age-stratified demographic projections to 2050 at a grid-cell level,
    using population projections and growth factors. Compares these projections to
    existing sub-national demographic projection studies for the US, EU, India, UK,
    and China.
  10: Compares age-stratified population projections under different SSPs to quantify
    the total error, percent error, and mean local percent error, using grid cells
    as the fundamental unit of analysis. Decomposes exposure change into contributions
    of age structure, population size, and meteorology
More Notes:
  4: "The paper decomposes the overall future change in exposure in terms of Person\
    \ Degree Days and Person Hot Days. Critical thresholds of 1200 CDDs/yr and 37.5\xB0\
    \ C (dangerous temperature even under short exposure) are identified."
  5: "The analysis includes country-level results in the SI Appendix (Figs. SI-23\u2013\
    SI-37). Africa's total population growth will have the largest impact on heat\
    \ exposure. Decomposition results at the country level are provided to account\
    \ for subregional heterogeneities. Figures SI-19-SI-21 in the SI Appendix present\
    \ similar figures for SSP1(26), 3(70), and 5(85)."
  7: The paper suggests that areas with aging populations and rising heat exposures
    will face considerable demands for social and health services. It also emphasizes
    the need to integrate climate change and healthy ageing agendas in adaptation
    planning.
  8: The page discusses the significance of demographic data for understanding adaptation
    strategies and population changes, but lacks specific data on macroeconomic outcomes.
  9: The limitation of this approach is its assumption of geographically homogeneous,
    within-country trends by age stratum.
  10: The analysis focuses on the population aged 69+

Quantitative material:
  4: "The average 95th percentile of the maximum temperature distribution increases\
    \ by at least 1\xB0C in all regions and scenarios; Europe shows the largest changes\
    \ in exposure, with the average number of hot days (#HDs) increasing from 0 to\
    \ 3, and number of CDDs more than tripling."

    \ to specific temperature thresholds (TMAX95 > 37.5\xB0C), CDD exposure levels,\

    \ scenarios (1(26), 2(45), 3(70), 5(85)) up to 2050."
