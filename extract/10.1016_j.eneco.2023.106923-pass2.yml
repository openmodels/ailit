Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (more frequent and intense extreme temperature events), per capita
    income growth, future weather anomalies and their interannual variability.
  2: Unanticipated weather shocks and changes in average climate conditions impacting
    electricity demand.
  4: Weather anomalies (deviations of daily maximum temperature from 30-year averages)
    and long-run climate normals (30-year moving average of daily maximum temperature).
  6: Shifts in daily maximum temperature distribution, weather anomalies (positive
    and negative), per capita income, adoption of air-cooling appliances, energy efficiency
    of appliances, home insulation.
  7: Climate change, specifically shifts in mean temperature and weather anomalies
    (positive weather anomalies or temperature shocks) are found to have a significant
    impact on peak electricity demand.
  8: Climatic shifts in the moving average of daily maximum temperatures and future
    positive weather anomalies departing from the moving average of daily maximum
    temperatures are the key drivers of risk.
  10: Increase in maximum temperatures' climate norms, unexpected variation around
    those norms, future socioeconomic and climatic shifts.
Highlights:
  1: Shocks over the long-run differ substantially from the short-run dynamics; per
    capita income modulates the adjustments over the short- and long-run; structure
    of the economy and differences in future income growth matter in shaping the adaptation
    to climate change; future weather anomalies can further amplify the relative increase
    associated to the shift in the climate norm; challenges to accommodate the peak
    load in days with extreme temperatures may substantially increase already around
    mid-century.
  2: Identifies the difference between short-term (intensive) and long-term (extensive)
    adaptation responses in electricity consumption to climate change using a new
    methodology.
  4: The paper characterizes the response of per capita daily peak load to climate
    and weather anomalies. It decomposes temperature into long-run climate normals
    and weather anomalies. The effect of weather anomalies is conditional on the temperature
    level.
  6: Long-run adjustments driven by slowly changing climatic exposure, including the
    amplification effect of income growth, are roughly two times larger than shocks
    computed based on the naive weather response function.
  7: Climate change affects peak electricity demand differently across regions, with
    a North-South gradient in Europe. Positive weather anomalies amplify the impact.
    There are increases in peak capacity demands in 2050 due to socio-economic growth.
  8: Climate change will significantly increase peak load demand in both India and
    Europe by 2050, necessitating substantial increases in energy infrastructure capacity.
  10: Both an increase in the maximum temperatures' climate norms and the inherent
    unexpected variation around that norms can contribute to increase the pressure
    on the peak load in Europe and India, with respect to historical climate conditions.
Methodology:
  1: Decomposes short- from medium/long-run effects on daily electricity peak load
    using mixed frequency panel data across states in Europe and India, treating economic
    growth as a modulating factor; exploits variation in unexpected daily weather
    anomalies and decade-long climatic changes to decompose transitory (intensive
    margin) adjustments from permanent (extensive margin) adjustments.
  2: A framework to disentangle intensive- and extensive-margin adaptations in electricity
    demand related to temperature using empirical models and projections from global
    climate models.
  4: "Fixed-effect panel model is estimated for Europe and India, using daily data.\
    \ Models include binned temperature variables (3\xB0C intervals), weather anomalies,\
    \ per capita GDP, and fixed effects."
  6: Analysis of short-run and long-run peak load responses to temperature variations,
    considering extensive and intensive margins. The long-run spline function is modulated
    by the short-run adjustment effect triggered by weather anomalies. The peak load
    response depends on the underlying combination of the expected climate and weather
    anomalies.
  7: The study estimates the impact of climate change on peak electricity demand by
    analyzing the relationship between maximum temperature exposure and peak load.
    Weather anomalies are projected using 25 GCMs for the period 2040-2060. The analysis
    considers both short-run and long-run adaptation responses, and incorporates socio-economic
    growth forecasts. The aggregation from grid-cell to country shocks is based on
    population share, and the aggregation from the National to the regional level
    is based on the share of National peak demand over the regional total in 2019.
  8: The study uses 25 Global Climate Models (GCMs) under RCP 5-8.5 to project peak
    load changes, accounting for both mean climate shifts and weather anomalies around
    2050. It decomposes peak load into historical levels, income per capita growth
    effects, climate change impacts, and weather anomaly effects.
  10: A new methodology is proposed for assessing climate change adaptation by identifying
    the average impact of long-run climatic changes and capturing the fast responses
    of peak load to unexpected weather anomalies. It uses historical diffusion of
    appliances and their average energy efficiency as a measure of the extensive margin
    in the future.
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on the impact of climate change on electricity peak load and
    the modulating role of economic growth and weather anomalies in Europe and India.
    The results have implications for power systems' generation capacity, transmission,
    and storage.
  2: The paper discusses how income and expected climate conditions influence the
    utilization and adoption of durable assets like air conditioning.
  4: The paper tests different model specifications, including interactions between
    climate variables, weather anomalies, and income. The identification strategy
    relies on contemporaneous weather realizations.
  6: The study differentiates between short-run and long-run responses of peak load
    to temperature, considering the extensive margin (adoption of air-cooling) and
    intensive margin (usage of existing cooling). Per capita income modulates both
    the long-run and short-run responses.
  7: The paper highlights the importance of considering both the average climate change
    impact and the effect of weather anomalies when assessing the impact on electricity
    grids. The observed relationship between temperature and peak load follows a U-shaped
    pattern in temperate regions and a monotonic function in tropical regions.
  8: The study separates the impact of climate change from socioeconomic drivers and
    weather anomalies. The annual peak load increase is decomposed into historical
    annual peak, income per capita growth under RCP 5-8.5, climate change and a positive
    weather anomaly, all under the RCP 5-8.5 scenario
  10: The paper acknowledges limitations in accounting for humidity, seasonal economic
    activities, differences in the long-run response function across sectors, and
    implications for the supply-side (power generation, grid constraints).

    in India around 2050 depending on the degree of warming and the evolution of socio-economic
    conditions; doubling of the impacts of climate change during the summer in Europe
    assuming the interannual variability of maximum temperatures follows the distribution
    observed in the past.

  6: "Long-run increase of peak load of up to 12% in Europe and 15% in India under\
    \ RCP 5-8.5. Shocks associated with maximum temperatures above 30\xB0C in Europe\
    \ and above 33\xB0C in India more than double when per capita income shifts from\
    \ the 25th to the 75th quantile."
  7: Positive weather anomalies can result in a peak load shock of 20% in both Europe
    and India under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Northern European countries experience reductions
    in peak load of up to -20% due to milder winters, while Southern countries experience
    an exacerbation of summer peaks of up to 20% (33%), excluding (including) the
    additional effect of response. Delhi and Goa are the states with the highest relative
    increase in daily peak load, reaching values around 30% (33%), excluding (including)
    the additional effect of positive weather anomalies.
  8: In India, an additional 185 GW of annual peak demand will be required (a 140%
    increase from the historical annual peak) by 2050 under RCP 5-8.5. In Europe,
    80 GW will be required (a 19% increase from the historical annual peak) by 2050
    under RCP 5-8.5.

    \ shifts on peak load by assuming that today\u2019s structure of the power market\
    \ is maintained towards 2050."
