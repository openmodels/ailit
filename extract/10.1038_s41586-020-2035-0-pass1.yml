Drivers of Risk:
  9: Rising atmospheric CO2, rising air temperature, drought, forest dynamics, carbon
    losses from tree mortality.
  16: Decline in forest area and reduced mean pan-tropical sink strength (Mg C ha-1
    yr-1 decade-1) are driven by factors not fully elaborated on this page but mentioned
    to include climate-driven variables and ongoing forest area losses.
  31: "Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO\u2082), mean annual air temperature\
    \ (MAT), and drought (Maximum Climatological Water Deficit, MCWD)."
  33: Changes in carbon sink capacity of intact forests in Africa, Amazonia, and pan-tropics.
  43: Anthropogenic CO2 emissions
  45: Atmospheric CO2 concentration, mean annual temperature, and drought intensity
    (quantified as maximum climatological water deficit).
  51: CO2-change and temperature rises (MAT and MAT-change)
  53: Change in Mean Annual Temperature (MAT), change in Maximum Climatic Water Deficit
    (MCWD), change in CO2 concentration (CO2-change), and change in MAT (MAT-change).
  54: Future environmental conditions, specifically in the 2020s, under RCP scenarios
  55: Climate change would lead to a sharp acceleration of Central African forests
    dynamics by the end of the century.
  64: "Changes in CO\u2082 concentration, Mean Annual Temperature (MAT), MAT of the\
    \ coldest week, Maximum climatological water deficit (MCWD), cumulative precipitation,\
    \ and vapor pressure deficit (VPD)."
Highlights:
  9: "The uptake of carbon into Earth\u2019s intact tropical forests peaked in the\
    \ 1990s. The African carbon sink is showing signs of saturation."
  16: Earth has passed the point of peak carbon sequestration into intact tropical
    forests. The continental sink in Amazonia peaked in the 1990s. Peak pan-tropical
    intact forest uptake was in the 1990s and is projected to decline significantly
    by the 2030s.
  31: "The study analyzes the effects of CO\u2082, temperature, and drought on carbon\
    \ gains (woody production) and carbon losses (tree mortality) in African and Amazonian\
    \ tropical forests."
  33: "The table presents mean carbon sink values, with uncertainty ranges (95% bootstrapped\
    \ confidence intervals for historical data, 2\u03C3 for predictions). The carbon\
    \ sink in intact forests is declining in the Amazon and pan-tropics in later periods."
  43: "Calculates the proportion of anthropogenic CO2 emissions removed by Earth\u2019\
    s intact tropical forests"
  45: No relevant information
  51: Temperature rises negatively affect carbon gains, especially in the Amazon.
    The Amazon carbon sink is projected to reach zero between 2035 and 2041.
  53: The study analyzes the sensitivity of a carbon sink model to changes in key
    climate variables under different RCP scenarios. It focuses on changes in MAT,
    MCWD and CO2, without directly connecting to macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes.
  54: Future sink strength is sensitive to future environmental conditions, with a
    projected decline in both continents in the 2020s under various RCP scenarios.
  55: No relevant information
  64: "The study analyzes trends in climate-related metrics in African and Amazonian\
    \ tropical forests from 1980 to 2020 with projections to 2040. Significant changes\
    \ are observed in several key metrics, including CO\u2082 concentration, MAT,\
    \ and MCWD, with regional variations between Africa and the Amazon."
Methodology:
  9: Assessment of carbon sink trends using 244 structurally intact African tropical
    forests spanning 11 countries, comparison with 321 published plots from Amazonia,
    and investigation of the underlying drivers of the trends. Statistical model including
    CO2, temperature, drought and forest dynamics.
  16: Scaling estimated mean sink strength by forest area for each continent to estimate
    pan-tropical carbon uptake.
  31: "Linear mixed effects models were used with census intervals nested within plots,\
    \ using a weighting based on interval length and plot area. Data from African\
    \ and Amazonian inventory plots were pooled. Plots monitored for >20 years are\
    \ distinguished from those monitored for \u2264 5 years."
  33: Analysis based on plot data and continent-specific extrapolations. Predictions
    for 2010-2040 are model-based using parameters from Table 2. Pan-tropical values
    are area-weighted means of African, Amazonian, and Southeast Asian values.
  43: "Calculates the proportion of anthropogenic CO2 emissions removed by Earth\u2019\
    s intact tropical forests by dividing the total pan-tropical carbon sink by total\
    \ anthropogenic CO2 emissions."
  45: "The paper uses environmental predictor variables (CO2 concentration, temperature,\
    \ and drought intensity) and calculates interval-specific means to remove seasonal\
    \ effects. The length of each census interval was rounded to the nearest complete\
    \ year. Temporally resolved (1901-2015) monthly mean temperature data from the\
    \ Climatic Research Unit (CRU TS version 4.03) was downscaled from ~3025 km\xB2\
    \ resolution to ~1 km\xB2 resolution using the WorldClim dataset."
  51: Model averaging and best-ranked models are used to estimate trends in carbon
    gains and losses based on predictor variables (CO2-change, MAT, MAT-change, MCWD,
    WD and CRT). The analysis extends from 1983 to 2040.
  53: Sensitivity analysis of future predictions of a carbon sink model is performed
    by modifying future trajectories of predictor variables (MAT-change, MCWD, CO2-change,
    MAT) one at a time. Likely bounds of possibility are assessed by taking the steepest
    slope of either continent from extrapolated trends, doubling this slope or taking
    the opposite of this slope and applying it on both continents. Future slopes under
    three future Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6, 4.5,
    and 8.5) are calculated for CO2-change and MAT. The RCP trends are then adjusted
    to be a continuation of the observed trajectory in 2015.
  54: Analysis uses modified slopes and RCP scenarios to project sink strength. Results
    are applicable to 2020s and 2030 for specific continents.
  55: No relevant information
  64: Linear mixed effect models were performed with census intervals (n=1566) nested
    within plots (n=565) to avoid pseudo-replication, using an empirically derived
    weighting based on interval length and plot area.
More Notes:
  9: The findings suggest a long-term future decline in the African carbon sink and
    a continued rapid weakening of the Amazonian sink. The divergence in carbon sink
    responses between African and Amazonian forests is driven by carbon losses from
    tree mortality.
  16: The study acknowledges limitations in its method of scaling to arrive at a pan-tropical
    sink estimate. The paper suggests a carbon fertilization effect, leading to an
    increase in aboveground carbon stocks.
  31: The data represents structurally intact old-growth African and Amazonian tropical
    forests. The level of transparency of data points represents monitoring length.
  33: The total continental carbon sink includes estimates of trees <100 mm DBH, lianas,
    and roots.

  45: This page focuses on the methodology for addressing seasonal variability and
    selecting environmental predictor variables. The dependent variable of interest
    to the paper is not stated in this excerpt, but could be used to determine if
    the paper contributes to the specified outcome of interest.
  53: The paper focuses on carbon sink prediction. The connection to national-level
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks and adaptation costs/benefits is not explicit
    in this section.
  54: MCWD is mentioned as a factor with low or no sensitivity in line 1215, suggesting
    a focus on other environmental variables.
  55: The page primarily lists publications related to forest ecology and management,
    with one paper (Claeys et al., 2019) mentioning the impact of climate change on
    Central African forests. This could be relevant to a broader analysis of climate
    risks, but it doesn't directly address macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes at a national
    level.
  64: The study focuses on forest dynamics and carbon gains/losses in relation to
    climate change, which can indirectly impact macroeconomic and fiscal outcomes
    at a national level through ecosystem services, resource availability, and climate-related
    disasters. The analysis uses data from structurally intact African and Amazonian
    tropical forest inventory plots.

Quantitative material:
  9: The carbon sink in live aboveground biomass in intact African tropical forests
    has been stable for the three decades to 2015, at 0.66 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (95% CI:0.53-0.79).
  16: "Pan-tropical intact forest uptake peaked in the 1990s at 1.26 Pg C yr-1, projected\
    \ to decline to 0.29 Pg C yr-1 in the 2030s, a multi-decade decline of ~0.24 Pg\
    \ C yr-1 decade-1. The mean pan-tropical sink strength declines at 0.1 Mg C ha-1\
    \ yr-1 decade-1. Forest area losses are ~13.5 million ha yr-1. Increase in aboveground\
    \ carbon stocks of 10.8\xB13.7 Mg C ha-1 100 ppm-1 CO2, or 6.5\xB12.2%."
  31: 'Slopes and p-values from linear mixed effects models are provided for relationships
    between environmental drivers and carbon gains/losses. Examples include plot a:
    slope 0.003, p-value 0.021.'
  33: Estimates of carbon sink per unit area (Mg C ha-1 yr-1) and total carbon sink
    (Pg C yr-1) for Africa, Amazon, and pan-tropics for 1980-2015 and predictions
    for 2010-2040.
  43: Total anthropogenic CO2 emissions are estimated at 7.6 Pg C yr-1 in the 1990s,
    9.0 Pg C yr-1 in the 2000s, and 11.1 Pg C yr-1 in the 2010s.
  45: "Atmospheric CO2 concentration is highly correlated with time (R\xB2=0.98);\
    \ carbon gains are slightly better correlated with CO2 (Radj\xB2=0.0027) than\
    \ with time (R adj\xB2=0.0025)."
  51: From 2000 to 2015, carbon gains increased due to CO2-change (+3.7% in both the
    averaged and the best-ranked models, both continents), while temperature rises
    led to a decline in gains in the Amazon (-1.14% and -1.07% due to MAT and MAT-change
    together in the averaged and best-ranked model respectively). Future net sink
    trend in Africa is -0.004 and -0.003 in the best-ranked and averaged models respectively;
    in Amazonia the future net sink trend is -0.013 and -0.011 in the best-ranked
    and averaged models respectively. The Amazon sink reaches zero in 2041 using model-averaged
    parameters compared to 2035 using the best-ranked models.
  53: Future RCP CO2-change slopes (ppm yr-1) were calculated using RCP CO2 concentration
    data for the years between 2015 and 2030 inclusive. Future RCP MAT and MAT-change
    slopes were obtained from plot-specific MAT values extracted from downscaled 30
    seconds resolution data for current and future climate from WorldClim, and averaged
    over 19 CMIP5 models (2040-2060 compared to 1970-2000 climate MAT).
