Drivers of Risk:
  1: Loss and degradation of mangroves driven by herbicides during the Vietnam War
    and later by conversion to aquaculture and coastal development.
  2: Impacts of climate change, sea level rise, changes to sediment budgets due to
    the increase in hydropower stations on major river courses.
  7: Herbicides used during the Vietnam War and activities like shrimp farming weaken
    mangrove ecosystems.
  8: Sea level rise, agricultural activities, manmade structures (dams, settlements),
    anthropogenic barriers (hard infrastructure), waste disposal (trace metals, organic
    contaminants, chemicals), oil spills, complex organic materials, antibiotics,
    sedimentary organic carbon, insecticides, Dioxin contamination in the soil
  19: Conversion of mangroves to aquaculture, deforestation, and river damming.
  28: Sea level rise and coastal storms
  29: Incoherent policies and administrative conflicts between ministries (MONRE and
    MARD) pose a barrier to effective mangrove management in Vietnam.
  34: Climate change impacts on mangroves in Vietnam include sea level rise, increased
    storm intensity, and reduced sediment discharge due to damming and sediment mining.
  36: Losses of mangroves, climate change
  39: Sea level rise adversely affects mangroves due to changes in duration and frequency
    of inundation and alterations in salinity levels; mangrove degradation due to
    unplanned shrimp farming and illegal logging; historical lack of sufficient regulatory
    mechanisms for the protection of mangroves.
  40: Uncontrolled aquaculture development, logging, sea level rise, alterations to
    sediment budgets.
Highlights:
  1: Mangroves in Vietnam provide coastal protection from storm events, but have been
    lost or degraded due to human activities.
  19: Mangrove forests are an important source of income for local communities, but
    they have been degraded and lost due to conversion to aquaculture, deforestation,
    and river damming.
  28: Community-based mangrove plantation projects by the Vietnam Red Cross have shown
    remarkable achievements in the protection of dykes since 1994.
  29: Financial resources for mangrove conservation in Vietnam are inadequate, suggesting
    a potential for ecosystem service payments as a solution.
  34: Sea level rise is a significant threat to mangrove habitats in Vietnam, especially
    in the Mekong and Red River deltas, compounded by hydropower development and climate
    change.
  36: Mangrove restoration is an important strategic option for coastal management
    due to its ecosystem services and role in carbon sequestration.
  39: Mangrove forests in Vietnam support high species diversity as well as providing
    a range of ecosystem services, with fisheries and aquaculture being vital to local
    economies. Over 70% of mangroves in Vietnam occur in the South, mostly located
    along the Mekong River and its delta.
Methodology:
  19: No relevant information
  40: Remote sensing (satellite data, mapping algorithms), UAVs, LiDAR data.
More Notes:
  2: The paper focuses on Vietnamese mangroves (Can Gio, Ca Mau and Red River Delta).
  8: Focuses on the Mekong delta and Vietnam more broadly. Describes the sedimentary
    and hydrological environment of mangroves in Vietnam, noting variations in soil
    composition and sediment dynamics along the coast. Rapid progradation of the Mekong
    delta facilitates mangrove establishment.
  19: This page focuses on the role of mangroves in local livelihoods and ecosystem
    services, particularly in Vietnam, rather than nation-wide macroeconomic or fiscal
    outcomes. It highlights risks to these livelihoods due to mangrove loss.
  28: Mangrove rehabilitation is identified as a soft climate change adaptation strategy.
  36: Suggests mangrove restoration is a 'soft defence option' for coastal management.
  39: 82% of marine products in the country are derived from inshore areas.
  40: Financial resources for mangrove conservation are limited, but co-management
    schemes have been implemented to reduce the impact of conservation on local populations
    and improve ownership.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Coastal protection from storm events provided by mangroves.
  2: Economic benefits derived from mangroves in Vietnam.
  8: Mangrove submergence and migration inland, degradation of mangrove ecosystems/habitat
  19: No relevant information
  28: Direct economic and ecological benefits from mangrove plantations; protective
    benefits for private assets located outside sea-dykes; reduced disaster-induced
    material and non-material losses; reduced disaster-induced long-term indirect
    losses; shoreline stabilization; reduced sea-dyke maintenance cost; carbon sequestration;
    nutrient retention; sediment retention; biodiversity habitat; flood attenuation;
    wastewater treatment; and water supply and recharge.
  36: Socio-economic impacts linked to climate change including saline water intrusion
    impacting rice production in Red River and Mekong deltas, storm surge related
    damage to infrastructure, and flooding.
  39: Fisheries and aquaculture are considered to be vital to local economies.
  40: Mangrove area cover, success of mangrove restoration and rehabilitation schemes,
    cost-effectiveness of mangrove conservation, impact of conservation on local populations.
Quantitative material:
  19: 22.8% of total household income for communities near mangroves in the northern
    coast
  36: Newly restored mangroves have relatively low levels of carbon stored initially,
    but natural-state, naturally regenerated, and restored mangroves have been found
    to store 765-1026 MgC/ha in Vietnam.
