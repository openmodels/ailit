Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change, rising global water demand, variable precipitation patterns.
  10: Changes in precipitation and runoff leading to changes in basin yields, both
    increases and decreases, as a result of climate change.
  16: Changes in minimum flows, variability, or mean conditions under climate change
    would affect basin yield; basins with decreasing yields incur costs to maintain
    historical yields.
  17: Changes in precipitation and temperature impacting runoff; different climate
    models and scenarios (e.g., dry vs. wet).
  19: Temperature changes across different regions due to varying climate scenarios
    (22A1B, 40NCARs, 17ECHAMs, 20C5R8).
  20: Climatic driver of uncertainty in projections of water demand and availability;
    Projected changes in precipitation and temperature drive modeled changes in river
    runoff.
Highlights:
  2: Agreement across climate model ensembles suggests a high degree of confidence
    in the direction of change in water availability, providing clearer signals for
    longer-term investment decisions in water infrastructure.
  10: Climate change may provide economic benefits if basins have existing water deficits,
    growing demands, or water trading markets. If yields decline adaptation response
    is assumed to be storage or an alternative. The economic impacts of maintaining
    current basin yields are estimated.
  14: A drying signal emerges in some arid regions by the 2050 era during the dry
    season, indicating robust agreement on certain regional trends.
  16: The median annual global net costs of adapting to climate change in the 2050
    era is $15 billion yr-1 at a 5% discount rate.
  17: There is a general agreement on benefits in South Asia (SA) and on costs in
    Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Economic outcomes map to runoff, and changes
    in precipitation have a magnified effect on runoff in many basins, leading to
    greater sign agreement in economic outcomes.
  19: The study examines how a broader range of ensembles informs evaluation of features
    that are robust to internal variability as well as to multiple model formalisms,
    focusing on projected river runoff, irrigation water requirements and basin storage
    yield and their associated global annualized costs.
  20: Adaptation costs occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean,
    and the Middle East and northern Africa and benefits occurring in central and
    South Asia related to basin-scale supply systems to 2050 water availability.
Methodology:
  2: Uses large-ensemble runs of climate projections from different climate models
    and repeated runs of individual models to probabilistically evaluate climate change
    effects on water resources.
  10: Uses baseline and projected annual runoff and low-flow values to create storage
    yield curves for 126 basins under 220 GCM runs for 2050 and 2090 eras. Estimates
    changes in basin yields and required storage. Assumes adaptation response is storage
    or alternative up to $1/m^3 of lost yield.
  14: The analysis uses signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) to identify statistically significant
    climate signals and agreement on trends from model ensembles.
  16: The economic effects of climate change are estimated by assuming that basins
    with decreasing yields incur costs to maintain historical yields and that basins
    with increasing yields gain as economic benefits if water is scarce; Costs are
    cheaper with either increased storage or a backstop of $1 m23 of lost yield, whichever
    is less expensive.
  17: Aggregates basin-scale costs to seven World Bank regions to evaluate agreement
    among adaptation cost estimates. Uses between-model and within-model ensembles
    to assess costs.
  19: The analysis uses a range of available within- and between-model ensembles to
    explore the spatial and temporal patterns of high confidence as well as uncertainty
    in projected river runoff, irrigation water requirements, and basin storage yield.
  20: Multiple-member GCM ensembles used to project changes in water availability
    and river runoff; Basin yield is used to integrate changes in mean and variability
    of runoff.
More Notes:
  2: Focuses on water resource systems and adaptation measures.
  10: 'The study considers two ways storage yield curves are useful: 1) Impact on
    yield given fixed storage; 2) Change in storage to maintain fixed yield. The figures
    show percent change in precipitation between the 1961-90 baseline and the 2050
    era across different latitude bands.'
  16: The study focuses on the economic impacts of climate change on water resources,
    specifically looking at changes in basin yields and the costs/benefits associated
    with maintaining or adapting to those changes.
  17: The fitted precipitation line being generally above the runoff line in Fig.
    14 indicates that zero changes in precipitation will still result in costs due
    to the temperature effect. Includes Zambezi, Volta and Niger river basins as examples
    of basins that benefit from changes in precipitation.
  19: Precipitation is the main driver influencing river runoff, irrigation water
    requirements, and basin storage yield.
  20: Agreement on irrigation water requirements suggests the projections are robust.
    Agreement across broad range of GCM ensembles suggests a high degree of confidence
    in direction of change in water availability.
