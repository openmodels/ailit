Drivers of Risk:
  1: Increased drought severity in recent decades was linked to changes in frequency
    of dry and wet circulation types.
  4: Changes in input variables impacting drought indices; Specifically, changes in
    atmospheric circulation impacting drought.
Highlights:
  1: "The 2015\u20132018 drought was record\u2010breaking in the context of the observational\
    \ record in central Europe."
  4: Individual drought indices respond differently to changes in input variables.
    Short-term drought indices (PZIN and SPEI-4) exhibit larger values of weekly tendencies
    compared to long-term ones.
Methodology:
  1: "Temporal variability of drought conditions since the late 19th century was analyzed\
    \ at seven long\u2010term stations distributed across the Czech Republic using\
    \ the Palmer Drought Severity Index and the Standardized Precipitation Evaporation\
    \ Index."
  4: Analyzes weekly changes (tendencies) in drought indices (PDSI, SPEI-52, PZIN,
    SPEI-4) for vegetation and cold periods using data from meteorological stations
    (Prague-Klementinum, Tabor, Klatovy) from start of station observation to 2018.
    Calculates circulation indices (flow strength, direction, vorticity) using sea
    level pressure data from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis (1948 onward) at 16 points across
    Europe.
More Notes:
  1: The study links increased drought severity to changes in atmospheric circulation.
  4: The paper focuses on analyzing drought indices and their relationship to atmospheric
    circulation, not directly on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes, or the costs and
    benefits of adaptation.
