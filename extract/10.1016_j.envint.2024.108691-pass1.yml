Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature frequency and local temperature
  2: Shocks impacting outcomes include the frequency and intensity of hot days due
    to global warming.
  3: Temperature frequency (normalized number of days a specific temperature occurs).
  4: Changes in frequency of temperature, specifically low, moderate, and extreme
    temperatures, impact mortality outcomes.
  5: Temperature frequency is the driver of risk.
  6: Temperature (specifically, comparing mortality at the 10th percentile of temperature
    to mortality at the most frequent temperature)
  7: Temperature frequency, categorized into extreme cold, extreme hot, moderate cold,
    and moderate hot.
  8: Frequency of exposure to cold and hot temperatures; climate zone; socioeconomic
    factors
  10: The driver of risk is short-term temperature variability.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Mortality
  2: The paper evaluates the association between temperature frequency and all-cause
    mortality.
  3: Evaluates the association between temperature frequency and mortality risk.
  4: "The study evaluates the temperature-related mortality risks by examining the\
    \ exposure\u2013response associations of different temperature components across\
    \ various regions."
  5: All-cause mortality is being evaluated.
  6: Mortality
  7: Evaluates the impact of temperature frequency on all-cause mortality.
  8: Mortality risk associated with temperature frequency
  10: The paper by Y. Wu et al. (2022) evaluates the global, regional, and national
    burden of mortality associated with short-term temperature variability from 2000-2019.
Highlights:
  1: Temperature frequency and mortality
  2: The study finds a declining risk of mortality associated with higher temperature
    frequency, suggesting adaptation to local climates.
  3: Aims to evaluate the association between temperature frequency and mortality
    risk across 757 locations in 47 countries. Aims to examine the variations in human
    adaptation to diverse temperatures.
  4: Significant increases in mortality risks were found, with South Europe showing
    the highest increase, and mortality risk being strongest on the present day, attenuating
    over a 21-day lag.
  5: Higher normalized frequency corresponds to a lower relative risk of mortality.
  6: The plot shows percentage change in mortality and associated uncertainty (confidence
    intervals) for each country/region, and an 'Overall' summary value.
  7: Mortality risk decreases as temperature frequency increases. The most frequent
    temperature has the minimum mortality risk. Socio-economic status and climate
    characteristics are potential modifiers of the frequency-related mortality risk.
    The association between temperature frequency and mortality risk is linear and
    consistent across geographical locations.
  8: Human adaptation to temperature varies depending on specific temperature components.
    Greater reduction in mortality risk associated with increased frequency of cold
    temperatures compared to hot temperatures. Climate zone is an important determinant
    of frequency-related mortality risk. High-income countries exhibited a gradient
    in mortality risk
Methodology:
  1: Multi-Country Multi-City (MCC) Collaborative Network
  2: The study uses a two-stage time series design analyzing daily mortality and temperature
    data from 757 locations in 47 countries from 1979 to 2020.
  3: Two-stage time-series quasi-Poisson regression design, using distributed lag
    non-linear model (DLNM) to assess lagged associations of frequency over 21 days,
    controlling for seasonal trends and day of the week. Stratification analyses explore
    the modification effects of mean temperature on the frequency-mortality association.
  4: The analysis utilizes a model incorporating temperature frequency response, examining
    different geographical zones and socio-economic levels, and utilizes sensitivity
    analysis to explore these associations over time.
  5: Pooled cumulative associations between temperature frequency and all-cause mortality
    were analyzed.
  6: Compares mortality at the 10th percentile of normalized temperature frequency
    to the 100th percentile (most frequent temperature). Results are applicable to
    the countries/regions listed.
  7: A multi-country, population-based study that analyzes the association between
    temperature frequency and mortality risk, using normalized temperature frequency
    and controlling for lags and long-term time trends.
  8: A novel strategy for directly comparing temperature frequency-mortality associations
    across locations.
  10: The Y. Wu et al. (2022) study uses a three-stage modelling study applicable
    to the years 2000-2019.
More Notes:
  1: Article is published in Environment International in 2024.
  3: Absolute temperature is not directly included in the model to avoid multicollinearity
    as frequency inherently captures the effects of absolute temperature values. ANOVA
    F-test showed no significant enhancements in the model with absolute temperature.
  5: "The analysis uses the United Nations\u2019 M49 Standard for geographic regions,\
    \ and the French Reunion is the only location included in sub-Saharan Africa for\
    \ region-specific analysis."
  7: The study suggests adaptation plays a role, with populations developing resilience
    to the temperatures they encounter most frequently. Temperature frequency facilitates
    cross-location comparisons, avoiding the bias of comparing the effects of identical
    temperature values across different locations.
  8: Study acknowledges limitations including the inability to characterize frequency-mortality
    associations by age, sex, and cause of death, limited data availability in certain
    regions, and inability to investigate associations in low-income countries.
