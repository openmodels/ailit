Drivers of Risk:
  1: Temperature frequency
  4: Frequency of temperature (extreme cold, extreme hot, moderate cold, moderate
    hot)
  7: Temperature frequency (extreme cold, extreme hot, moderate cold, moderate hot).
Highlights:
  1: Assesses adaptation to local temperature; examines the relationship between temperature
    frequency and mortality.
  4: Mortality risk is significantly associated with the frequency of extreme temperatures,
    with extreme cold having the greatest impact. The association varies across regions,
    with South Europe exhibiting the highest increase in mortality risk with temperature
    frequency changes.
  7: Mortality risk decreases as temperature frequency increases. Populations develop
    better resilience to frequently encountered temperatures. Socio-economic status
    and climate characteristics were potential modifiers of the frequency-related
    mortality risk.
Methodology:
  1: Multi-Country Multi-City (MCC) Collaborative Network
  4: "A two-stage approach was used to extract exposure-response associations for\
    \ each temperature component and then pool the overall cumulative exposure-response\
    \ associations. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using alternative lag days,\
    \ degrees of freedom, and time periods. The study includes 120,758,598 deaths\
    \ across 757 locations from 47 countries/regions during the period 1990\u2013\
    2010."
  7: A multi-country, population-based study examines the association between temperature
    frequency and mortality risk at national, regional, and global levels. Temperature
    frequency is used to enable cross-location comparisons. Linear regressions relating
    temperature frequency and mortality risk are used.
More Notes:
  1: This is a study on the relationship between temperature and mortality. It may
    be related to economic risks of climate change because mortality can affect productivity,
    healthcare costs, and economic growth.
  4: The study also considers climatic zone and socioeconomic status as potential
    moderators of the frequency-mortality association, although the specific results
    for these are not reported on this page.
  7: The study introduces temperature frequency as a valuable concept for understanding
    temperature-mortality relationships.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Mortality
  4: Mortality risk
  7: Mortality risk is linked to temperature frequency.

  4: 'Overall increase of 13.03% (95% CI 12.17, 13.91) in mortality risk comparing
    the 10th percentile to the 100th percentile of normalized frequency of temperature.
    Increase in mortality risk of 18.64 % (95 % CI: 16.38, 20.94) for extreme cold,
    8.51 % (95 % CI: 7.25, 9.79) for extreme hot, 4.35 % (95 % CI: 3.56, 5.15) for
    moderate cold, and 2.38 % (95 % CI: 1.92, 2.85) for extreme hot, comparing the
    10th percentile to the 100th percentile of normalized frequency of each temperature
    component. Region-specific mortality risk percentage changes are also provided
    (e.g., South Europe exhibited the highest increase with 33.06%).'
  7: Percentage change of mortality comparing the 10th percentile to the 100th percentile
    of normalized frequency of temperature is presented for different climate zones
    and income classifications.
