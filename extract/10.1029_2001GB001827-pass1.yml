Drivers of Risk:
  1: Climate change (increasing temperature and altered precipitation patterns) driven
    by increased CO2 emissions from human activities (fossil fuels and land use change).
  12: Climate change impacts on land biosphere (temperature, precipitation, soil water
    content) leading to changes in Net Ecosystem Production (NEP).
Highlights:
  1: Climate change reduces global land carbon uptake, constituting a positive feedback
    in the climate-carbon cycle system. Tropical carbon storage saturates, with some
    regions becoming sources of CO2.
  12: The IPSL model predicts that the terrestrial biosphere does not become a global
    source of carbon by 2100. The Hadley model predicts that the terrestrial biosphere
    becomes a net source of carbon by 2100.
Methodology:
  1: Coupled climate-carbon cycle model forced by observed CO2 emissions (1860-1990)
    and IPCC SRES-A2 emission scenario (1991-2100).
  12: The study compares results from the IPSL climate-carbon cycle model to the Hadley
    model to evaluate the consequences of how the climate-carbon cycle system is modeled.
    The simulations cover the period up to 2100.
More Notes:
  12: The paper discusses differences between the IPSL and Hadley model simulations,
    mentioning differences in atmospheric CO2 levels by 2100. It also notes that the
    IPSL model only simulates net carbon release in South America due to soil drying.

  10: This page focuses on climate change impacts on terrestrial biosphere, specifically
    net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (RH) affecting net
    ecosystem production (NEP) in different latitudinal bands. It doesn't directly
    discuss macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, costs, or benefits of adaptation
    at a national level.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Global Net Primary Production (NPP) and net land uptake (NEP) reduction as a
    proxy for economic productivity relating to the terrestrial biosphere.
  12: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  1: Global NEP is reduced by 56% by the end of the 21st century due to climate change.
    80% reduction of net land CO2 uptake in the tropics due to increased evapotranspiration
    and reduced soil water content. 11% NEP increase in northern high latitudes due
    to lengthened growing season (18 days by 2100).
  12: The IPSL model simulates a cumulated terrestrial net storage of 465 Gt C in
    2100. The Hadley model simulates a net source to the atmosphere of 100 Gt C by
    2100.
