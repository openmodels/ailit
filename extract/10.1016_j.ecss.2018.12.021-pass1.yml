Drivers of Risk:
  1: Herbicides during the Vietnam War and later by conversion to aquaculture and
    coastal development.
  17: Erosion and typhoons.
  20: Unplanned development of shrimp farming areas in mangrove forests, conflict
    between economic development (shrimp aquaculture) and conservation, rapid growth
    of the aquaculture industry, far-reaching land and market reforms, and local misappropriation
    of the benefits of these reforms.
  22: Loss of mangrove vegetation due to shrimp farming and timber exploitation.
  28: Sea level rise and coastal storms.
  36: Climate change, specifically saline water intrusion impacting rice production,
    storm surge related damage to infrastructure, and flooding.
  38: Decreases in rainfall and increasing strength of storms and cyclones globally
    are impacting the Vietnamese coastline and mangrove ecosystems.
  39: Sea level rise affects mangroves due to changes in inundation and salinity.
    High and low tidal amplitudes impact mangrove propagation. Mangrove degradation
    and destruction occurred during the Vietnam War due to herbicides. Unplanned shrimp
    farming and illegal logging have further degraded mangroves.
Highlights:
  17: Mangrove forests provide coastal protection, support the fishing industry, and
    contribute to local livelihoods, providing significant economic and ecological
    benefits to Vietnam.
  22: Co-management models can protect mangrove vegetation and help local communities.
    Focus is often on the Mekong Delta, where more than 60% of Vietnam's mangroves
    are located.
  28: Community-based mangrove plantation projects have significant economic and ecological
    benefits, including disaster risk reduction and environmental benefits.
  36: Mangrove restoration as a soft defence option is an important strategic option
    for coastal management.
  38: Hydrological factors such as tides, salinity and erosion, which affect mangrove
    vegetation in Vietnam, are sensitive to climate change.
Methodology:
  22: Mapping and monitoring mangrove vegetation and ecosystem.
More Notes:
  17: The paper suggests that mangrove forests in Vietnam have a significant impact
    on socio-economic conditions and livelihoods, especially for economically deprived
    communities.
  20: The Vietnamese government is attempting to balance economic development with
    mangrove conservation and sustainable use, but faces challenges due to the aquaculture
    industry.
  28: The Vietnam Red Cross (VNRC) has been conducting community-based mangrove plantation
    since 1994.
  36: Mangroves also provide carbon sequestration and storage ecosystem services.
  39: The paper focuses on the role of mangroves in Vietnam and their vulnerability
    to sea level rise and human activities. It highlights the importance of mangroves
    for fisheries and aquaculture.

  23: This page focuses on remote sensing of mangrove ecosystems and does not contain
    information about macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes, economic costs/benefits
    of adaptation, or related drivers of risk at a national level.
  24: This page focuses on remote sensing methods for mapping and monitoring mangrove
    ecosystems in Vietnam. It does not directly address macroeconomic or macro-fiscal
    risks, costs, or benefits related to climate change adaptation at a national level.
  41: This page focuses on mangrove ecosystems in Vietnam and the challenges in researching
    them. It does not provide any quantitative macroeconomic or macro-fiscal analysis,
    nor does it discuss costs and benefits of adaptation at a national level or macroeconomic
    risks of climate change.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Carbon storage (blue carbon) and coastal protection from storm events.
  17: Reduction in dyke maintenance and coastal protection costs due to mangrove protection.
  20: Decrease in fish stocks and catch, increasing salt water intrusion, and water
    pollution in coastal areas.
  22: Local socio-economic development for communities near mangrove forests.
  28: Direct economic and ecological benefits, protective benefits for private assets,
    reduced disaster-induced material and non-material losses, reduced disaster-induced
    long-term indirect losses, shoreline stabilization, and reduced sea-dyke maintenance
    cost, carbon sequestration, nutrient retention, sediment retention, biodiversity
    habitat, flood attenuation, wastewater treatment, and water supply and recharge.
  36: Mangrove restoration is an important strategic option for coastal management
    because losses of mangroves set the stage for a range of socio-economic impacts
    linked to climate change.
  39: Fisheries and aquaculture are considered to be vital to local economies.
Quantitative material:
  17: Mangroves protect US$7 billion in property.
  20: 161,277.5 ha of mangroves converted to shrimp ponds and other activities between
    1953 and 1995; In the buffer zone, 60% of the area is used for afforestation and
    the remaining 40% is for aquaculture, agricultural cultivation and other activities.
  28: Showed remarkable achievements in the protection of dykes since 1994.
  36: Natural regenerated forests (42% decrease), decreasing the possibility of erosion
    and potentially stimulating sediment accumulation.
  39: 82% of marine products in the country are derived from inshore areas.
