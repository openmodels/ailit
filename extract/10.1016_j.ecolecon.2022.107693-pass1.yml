Drivers of Risk:
  1: Exposure to natural disasters, specifically hurricanes measured by maximum wind
    speed.
  2: Hurricanes and other natural disasters, specifically maximum wind speed recorded
    in each county cell during each hurricane.
  3: Hurricane exposure and resulting need for rebuilding and industrial changes.
  4: Hurricanes and tropical storms are the shocks impacting the Puerto Rican counties,
    causing varying levels of exposure and potential risk.

Highlights:
  1: Hurricanes cause a short-run, dynamic employment effect. There is substantial
    heterogeneity in employment responses across industries, partly explained by input-output
    linkages.
  2: Hurricanes lead to an average fall in employment, but with heterogeneous effects
    across industries, with some 'strengthened' (e.g., construction) and some 'weakened'
    (e.g., accommodation and scenic transportation) and 'neutral' industries. Input-output
    linkages explain some of the results at the industry level.
  3: Focuses on labor market responses in directly affected Puerto Rican regions during
    hurricanes, particularly industries' employment dynamics and the importance of
    input-output linkages.
  8: The impact of natural disasters on employment varies significantly across industries,
    even within 2-digit NAICS sectors (e.g., Transportation, NAICS 48). Some industries
    are 'strengthened', some are 'weakened', and some are 'neutral' in response to
    hurricanes.
  10: A disaster shock generates a construction boom and negatively affects retail,
    transport, and accommodation industries. Input-output linkages play a key role
    in the transmission of disaster shocks to employment across different industries.
  11: The table identifies industries expected to be strengthened, remain neutral,
    or be weakened in the given scenario. The magnitude of the coefficient indicates
    the strength of the impact.
  12: "Natural disasters lead to an average decline in employment, but there is extensive\
    \ heterogeneity at the industry level. This heterogeneity can be explained by\
    \ input\u2013output linkages."

Methodology:
  1: "Panel local projections using monthly data for 70 3-digit NAICS industries and\
    \ 78 Puerto Rican counties over the period 1995\u20132019."
  2: Local projections are used to explore the dynamic employment effects of hurricanes.
    A sequence of regressions are run for different prediction horizons, regressing
    the cumulative change of variables of interest on the disaster shock variable
    at each horizon. The analysis controls for pre-trends and seasonal effects.
  3: Utilizes a continuous treatment approach measuring hurricane wind exposure along
    with local projections for empirical analysis.
  4: The analysis constructs a hurricane exposure index using maximum windspeed data,
    population-weighted centroids, and historical hurricane data; local projections
    are used to explore employment effects from hurricane exposure.
  7: Regression analysis using industry-level data and Newey-West corrected standard
    errors to account for autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity. Considers a two-year
    horizon at monthly frequency (k ranges from 0 to 24) and quarterly frequency (k
    ranges from 0 to 8).
  8: Panel data analysis exploiting county-time and county-industry-time variation
    to estimate the dynamic effects of hurricanes on employment and wages. Impulse
    response functions (IRFs) are generated to show the effects at different time
    horizons (up to 12 months). Linear interpolation is used in some specifications.
    Industries are classified into 'strengthened', 'weakened', or 'neutral' based
    on their employment response.
  10: Local projections are used to estimate the effects of hurricanes on employment.
    BEA Input-Output table is used to analyze input-output linkages. The analysis
    is done at the county level in the US. The results are qualitatively similar when
    using different measures of exposure to natural disasters, and by varying the
    threshold for winds used in computing the windspeed.
  11: The analysis appears to estimate coefficients representing the impact on different
    industries over a 12-month horizon. The nature of the coefficients (e.g., elasticity,
    growth rate) is not specified.
  12: "The paper uses monthly data for 70 3-digit NAICS industries and 78 Puerto Rican\
    \ counties over the period 1995\u20132019 to study the short-run, dynamic employment\
