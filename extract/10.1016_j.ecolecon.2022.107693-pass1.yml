  30: Industry employment
Highlights:
  1: "Employment falls by 0.5% on average after a hurricane; substantial heterogeneity\
    \ in employment responses across industries; heterogeneity can be partly explained\
    \ by input\u2013output linkages."
  2: Key outcomes include heterogeneous employment effects across industries, with
    some industries benefiting and others suffering from hurricanes.
  3: This study focuses on the labor market effects associated with disaster damages,
    the direct need for rebuilding, and the resulting changes in the industrial structure
    in a lower-income setting (Puerto Rico).
  4: There is substantial variation in hurricane exposures across counties and over
    time.
  6: "Fig 2 shows disaster shock exposure by county over the period 1995\u20132017,\
    \ including and excluding outliers."
  7: Hurricanes cause a temporary decline in overall employment, with some industries
    (e.g., construction, furniture) experiencing an increase in employment, while
    others (e.g., crop production, retail) experience a decline. Average weekly wages
    increase after six months, but the result is not statistically significant.
  8: Some industries are 'strengthened', some are 'weakened', and some are 'neutral'
    with respect to employment following a hurricane. Heterogeneity in employment
    response to natural disasters can be found even within 2-digits sectors (e.g.,
    Transportation, NAICS 48).
  9: "Using detailed industry data is important to better gauge the employment effects\
    \ of natural disasters. Examples are NAICS 484 (\u2018\u2018Truck transportation\u2019\
    \u2019) and NAICS 488 (\u2018\u2018Support activities for transportation\u2019\
    \u2019) are strengthened; NAICS 481 (\u2018\u2018Air transportation\u2019\u2019\
    ) and NAICS 483 (\u2018\u2018Water transportation\u2019\u2019) are neutral; NAICS\
    \ 485 (\u2018\u2018Transit and ground passenger transportation\u2019\u2019) and\
    \ NAICS 487 (\u2018\u2018Scenic and sightseeing transportation\u2019\u2019) are\
    \ weakened."
  10: The construction sector experiences a boom following natural disasters, while
    the retail, transport, and accommodation sectors are negatively affected. Input-output
    linkages play a key role in employment changes across industries.
  11: The paper identifies certain industries as strengthened, neutral, or weakened
    over a 12-month period based on average coefficients.
  12: Natural disasters lead to an average decline in employment, masking heterogeneity
    at the industry level, which can be explained by input-output linkages.
  13: Adaptability-driven employment resilience could be an important building block
    of post-disaster resilience. Vocational education and training can play a central
    role in preparing young people for work, developing skills of adults, and responding
    to the labor market needs of the economy.

Methodology:
  1: "Panel local projections using monthly data for 70 3-digit NAICS industries and\
    \ 78 Puerto Rican counties over the period 1995\u20132019."
  2: Analysis uses local projections to dynamically measure employment changes in
    response to hurricanes, leveraging exogenous wind speed data at the county level.
  3: "Uses local projections to examine the economic impacts of hurricanes. The analysis\
    \ considers all counties in Puerto Rico and all hurricanes that occurred over\
    \ the period 1995-2017. Wind speed data is obtained from NOAA and the HURRECON\
    \ model is used to compute sustained wind velocity at the county\u2019s centroid."
  4: "Constructs an index of hurricane exposure (\U0001D446\U0001D450\U0001D461) based\
    \ on maximum windspeed affecting a county during a storm, normalized by the maximum\
    \ windspeed observed. Cubic powers account for wind force. Uses local projections\
    \ to explore the dynamic employment effects."
  6: "Data is analyzed for a panel of 78 counties and 70 3-digit industries from 1995M1\
    \ to 2019M11. Linear interpolation is applied to 8% of industry\u2013county\u2013\
    time employment and wage observations where zeros are reported due to anonymity\
    \ concerns. Results are presented excluding zeros, both with and without linear\
    \ interpolation. Analysis is performed at the county level. "
  7: Uses a regression model (Eq. 4) to analyze the impact of disaster shocks on employment
    at the industry level, controlling for pre-trends, monthly dummies, and clustering
    standard errors. The analysis considers a two-year horizon at monthly and quarterly
    frequencies.
  8: "Dynamic effects of hurricanes at time t on employment, average weekly wages,\
    \ unemployed and labor force at different horizons exploiting county\u2013time\
    \ variation. Dynamic effects of hurricanes at time t on employment, average weekly\
    \ wages, at different horizons exploiting county\u2013industry\u2013time variation\
    \ with and without linear interpolation. Time horizon of 12 months."
  9: "Exploits industry\u2013time variation to assess the dynamic effects of hurricanes\
    \ on employment. Analysis is performed for the period 1995-2019."
  10: Robustness checks include varying windspeed thresholds, using different windspeed
    calculation methods, and substituting geographical centroids for population-weighted
    centroids to estimate hurricane impacts.
  12: The study uses monthly data for 703-digits NAICS industries and 78 Puerto Rican
    counties over the period 1995-2019 to study the short-run, dynamic employment
    effects of natural disasters, using local projections.
  13: "The paper uses the HURRECON model to determine sustained wind velocity based\
    \ on hurricane track, size, intensity, and cover type. The model uses parameters\
    \ adapted from Holland\u2019s equation and parameterized following Boose et al.\
    \ (2004). The analysis appears to cover the period for which data is available\
    \ for the 23 hurricanes included in the baseline specification. It also considers\
    \ vocational training as a factor for post-disaster employment."
  14: Exploits industry-time variation.
  15: The data is compiled from the EM-DAT database, and hurricane categories are
    based on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale at maximum windspeed.
  19: "The analysis uses panel results controlling for alternative sets of fixed effects,\
    \ utilizing county\u2013industry\u2013time variation with and without linear interpolation."
  20: Panel results include zeros and exploit county-industry-time variation with
    county*industry and industry*time fixed effects. Analysis is done both with and
    without linear interpolation.
  24: Panel results with a formula for the wind speed (Depperman). Analysis exploits
    county-time variation or county-industry-time variation, with and without linear
    interpolation. Dynamic effects are evaluated at different horizons.

    county-time and county-industry-time variation with and without linear interpolation;
    considers different horizons.

  29: Panel results controlling for lags and leads of exposure measure. Exploits county-time
    variation and county-industry-time variation. Some results use linear interpolation.

More Notes:
  1: The study focuses on Puerto Rico due to its frequent and spatially dispersed
    exposure to hurricanes and the availability of high frequency, detailed employment
    data.
  3: The study uses a continuous treatment (wind speed) to account for differences
    in storm exposure, even within categories of the Saffir-Simpson scale.

    Wages (QCEW) by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States (BLS).
