Drivers of Risk:
  2: Shocks impacting dirty energy usage (carbon emissions), the relationship between
    carbon concentration and temperature, and the connection between temperature and
    damages
  3: 'Three distinct mean-zero, symmetric shocks: 1) affecting dirty energy usage,
    2) modulating the CO2 emissions-temperature relationship, and 3) altering the
    climate damage function parameter.'
  5: Shocks to both the climate system and the macro-economy.
  6: Damage from climate change under a business-as-usual scenario; potentially very
    adverse future shocks.
  7: Shocks in dirty energy's share in the production function can result in CO2 emissions
    remaining high or decreasing dramatically, affecting climate outcomes.
  8: Dirty energy usage shock, shocks to the climate-sensitivity parameter, and shocks
    to the parameter for the quadratic term in the damage function.
  9: Uncertainty about dirty energy usage (CO2 emissions), CO2-temperature sensitivity
    shock, damage-function parameter shock (climate-damage tipping points)
  10: Carbon-usage uncertainty (stochastic evolution of dirty energy's factor share),
    climate damage (Dt), CO2 emissions which are proportional to dirty energy usage.
  11: "The paper models temperature changes as a stochastic shock through the parameter\
    \ \u03BBt, representing a second key shock on climate-related outcomes."
  12: "Global mean surface temperature relative to its 1900 value (TAt); A climate\
    \ tipping point (TPt); Uncertainty in the dirty energy share in the production\
    \ function (\u03B3); Uncertainty in climate sensitivity (\u03BB)."
  14: Climate disasters, carbon taxation
  17: CO2 emissions and temperature increases
  18: Uncertainty in CO2 emissions; possibility that the share of dirty energy remains
    large.
  19: Shocks to dirty energy usage; slow transition to clean energy
  20: Potential for catastrophic damages if green energy transition is delayed.
  21: Shocks to the decline of dirty energy usage.
  22: Uncertainty about future dirty energy usage and the degree to which high CO2
    translates into higher temperatures are considered as shocks.
  23: "Uncertainty in Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS), specifically the parameter\
    \ \u03BB that translates CO2 levels into the forcing variable for global temperature\
    \ increase."
  24: Time-varying climate sensitivity parameter; CO2 concentration in the atmosphere;
    temperature shocks.
  25: Uncertainties related to climate change leading to catastrophic outcomes
  26: Energy usage and temperature shocks; climate uncertainty; probability of a climate
    disaster.
  27: A stochastic damage function with a tipping point in excess temperature, modeled
    as a random walk with reflecting barriers at 2.5 and 3.5 degrees.
  29: Lower tipping points; large damages from climate change; uncertainty in the
    damage function; catastrophic economies.
  30: Uncertainty in damage functions and varying levels of atmospheric CO2 concentration.
  31: CO2 concentration in the atmosphere; excess temperature increase (above 2 degrees
    Celsius with a climate sensitivity of 3)
Highlights:
  2: Pareto-improving carbon taxation can dramatically lower climate risk, in general,
    and disaster risk, in particular. Climate-risk tax, focused exclusively on limiting
    climate risk, can be as large or larger than the carbon average-damage tax, focused
    exclusively on limiting average damage.
  3: Climate disasters can arise due to significant skewness in the distribution of
    damages. Supply-side convexity (damage function) outweighs supply-side concavity
    (temperature-CO2 relationship) in determining carbon-risk damages.
  5: Optimal carbon-risk taxation can raise the welfare of future generations by up
    to 4 percent and substantially lowers the probability of crossing a climate tipping
    point.
  6: Carbon tax and revenue redistribution are used to mitigate climate risks. The
    policy aims to limit significant reductions in aggregate consumption by ensuring
    that each generation achieves the same expected utility as under the BAU scenario
    through revenue sharing. The analysis prioritizes finding Pareto paths that materially
    reduce the chances of a climate disaster, rather than achieving uniform welfare
    gains across generations.
  7: A 3-degree Celsius temperature increase represents a tipping point causing significantly
    larger damages, potentially leading to the collapse of major natural systems.
  8: A carbon tax scheme that increases significantly when temperature increases can
    lead to substantial welfare gains for all generations, with larger gains for future
    generations.
  9: The paper highlights the significant impact of uncertainty on the probability
    of climate disasters and demonstrates that CO2-dependent carbon taxes are more
    effective than fixed carbon taxes in mitigating climate risk.
  12: Climate change reduces output productivity. The model incorporates a climate
    tipping point that occurs at about 3 degrees excess temperature. The dirty energy
    share in production follows a random walk, with a long-term trend towards zero
    but subject to temporary reversals.
  14: Transfers and taxes are chosen to guarantee a Pareto-improvement and minimize
    the probability of climate disasters by maximizing the tax rate under the constraint
    that no current or future generation loses. Generation-specific revenue shares
    are adjusted in the first 12 periods to ensure that each initial cohort has the
    same expected remaining lifetime utility under the policy as without it.
  17: In the absence of risk, there is essentially no scope/need for policy.
  18: Uncertainty in CO2 emissions, especially the possibility of a persistently high
    share of dirty energy, leads to much larger potential long-run damages due to
    permanent planetary heating.
  19: Major economic damages can arise if dirty energy is used for an extended period;
    a slow transition to clean energy can dramatically raise the probability of a
    climate disaster.
  20: Visible recovery and small damages with high probability after 500 years, despite
    some remaining worst-case scenarios.
  21: A 25% carbon tax generates welfare gains, especially for future generations,
    and reduces the probability of climate disasters. However, it does not entirely
    prevent deleterious climate change, with potential for significant losses after
    200 and 500 years.
  24: Extreme temperatures and damages occur more frequently over time. Substantial
    damages can persist in the long run (500 years). Output and aggregate consumption
    become very volatile when CO2 concentration is high. Climate disasters occur frequently.
  26: A 20 percent tax on dirty energy is optimal and reduces the probability of a
    climate disaster while increasing certainty equivalence for future generations.
    Climate uncertainty can lead to higher precautionary savings.
  27: The introduction of a stochastic tipping point in the damage function increases
    the probability of climate disasters to about 9 percent.
  29: Substantial climate disaster risk remains even with a constant 35% tax rate;
    uncertainty in the damage function plays a crucial role.
  30: Increasing carbon taxes over time can further reduce climate disaster risks.
  31: A carbon tax that increases based on CO2 concentration can reduce the probability
    of climate disaster to around 1.3 percent, but provides similar welfare gains
    for future generations as a fixed tax. The majority of simulated carbon tax rates
    are 30 percent, slightly lower than the optimal fixed tax of 35 percent. However,
    they often increase to more than 35 percent and in some cases well beyond that.
Methodology:
  2: 12-period, overlapping generations model with mean-zero, symmetric shocks
  3: Overlapping generations (OLG) model with three climate risk shocks, calibrated
    to isolate the cost of each form of risk propagation. Focus is on finding Pareto-efficient
    paths of carbon-risk taxes.
  5: A large-scale overlapping generations (OLG) model is used to study optimal carbon-risk
    tax policy.
  6: Stochastic Overlapping Generations (OLG) model used to analyze the effects of
    carbon taxation and revenue redistribution. The model focuses on limiting the
    chance of significant reductions in aggregate consumption. Policy instruments
    include a tax on dirty energy (time-invariant or dependent on carbon levels) and
    time-varying sharing of tax revenues among generations to maintain current generations'
    expected utility at BAU levels.
  7: Involves a production function with technological progress leading to crowding-out
    of dirty energy, adopting a temperature equation and damage function largely aligned
    with established models but introducing tipping points with greater economic impacts.
  8: The model is solved with no uncertainty, assuming dirty energy is entirely supplanted
    by clean energy in 120 years. The damage function is based on Weitzman (2012).
    Shocks are modeled as random walks.
  9: Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with overlapping generations.
    The paper analyzes the effects of various shocks on the probability of climate
    disasters and the effectiveness of different carbon tax policies.
  10: Dynamic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents and incomplete financial
    markets.
  11: The analysis includes modeling the carbon cycle and temperature changes as a
    negative externality, incorporating stochastic elements in climate parameters.
  12: "The analysis uses equations to model temperature damage, output productivity\
    \ loss, and stochastic processes for dirty energy share, climate sensitivity,\
    \ and the tipping point. Random walks are assumed for \u03B3, \u03BB, and TP."
  14: Overlapping Generations (OLG) model; Projection method (Marcet (1988), Marcet
    and Marshall (1994), Marcet and Lorenzoni (2001), Judd et al. (2011)); Implementation
    follows Krusell and Smith (1998), Kubler and Scheidegger (2019); Addresses non-ergodicity
    in early periods of transition; Guarantees a Pareto-improvement for all current
    and future generations.
  15: Initial conditions assume a deterministic economy with constant CO2 levels,
    suddenly disrupted by the discovery of climate change potential.
  17: OLG (Overlapping Generations) model with no uncertainty; Grid search with lump-sum
    inter-generational transfers
  18: "Model with shocks to dirty energy share (\u03F5\u03B3,t) and a carbon average-damage\
    \ tax compared to carbon-risk tax. Model assumes 20% of emitted CO2 remains permanently."
  19: Simulations of a model with shocks to dirty energy usage, analyzing the resulting
    distributions of TFP-damages and temperatures under a 'Business as Usual' (BAU)
    equilibrium.
  21: Optimal carbon policy calculation with energy usage shocks. The model assumes
    60% of CO2 is permanent and 40% depreciates slowly. 5000 simulated paths are used.
  23: "The paper models the variation in climate sensitivity by assuming that \u03BB\
    \ follows a random walk. They use a simplistic climate model (from Golosov et\
    \ al. (2014))."
  24: Compute the equilibrium for an economy with no carbon taxes. Examine distribution
    of TFP-damages and temperature over time (20, 40, and 100 periods, representing
    100, 200, and 500 years).
  26: Numerical example using two shocks (energy usage and temperature shocks) in
    a model; applicable for generations born within the first five periods.
  27: The authors model the stochastic damage function with a random walk and reflecting
    barriers. They simulate the model without carbon taxation and analyze the distribution
    of TFP-damages and aggregate consumption losses over different time horizons (100,
    200, and 500 years).
  29: Compares the model with three sources of uncertainty to a deterministic model,
    focusing on a specification with more significant damages.
  31: Simulation of 600 periods; Carbon tax increases with CO2 concentration. The
    carbon tax is specified in equation (17), where St denotes the total amount of
    CO2 in the atmosphere.
More Notes:
  2: The model exhibits a de minimis climate problem absent its shocks. Due to non-linearities,
    symmetric shocks deliver negatively skewed impacts, including the potential for
    climate disasters.
  3: The paper models carbon risk not as a driver of average climate damage, but as
    a driver of downside risk, exploring optimal carbon taxation in a multi-generational
    context.
  6: The model switches entirely to green energy, at which point carbon taxation and
    redistribution end. Generational revenue shares are independent of the state of
    nature. The focus is on three climate risks, though they are not specified on
    this page.
  8: Energy-usage shocks are a prerequisite for generating climate disasters. Climate-sensitivity
    parameter is modeled as a random walk with reflecting barriers set to -30 and
    +30 percent around the mean.
  9: The paper introduces the concept of a 'carbon-risk tax' and argues that it can
    be as large or larger than the tax needed to handle average carbon damage.
  10: The model includes dirty energy production with capital and labor, carbon tax
    with revenue redistribution, and overlapping generations of households.
  12: The model ignores secular growth for simplicity.
  14: "The model uses aggregate state variables S1t, S2t, \u03B3t, \u03BBt, TPt, and\
    \ the aggregate capital stock Kt. The model condenses the distribution of assets\
    \ across agents into one state variable."
  17: The model predicts CO2 emissions decreasing monotonically and reaching zero
    after 120 years.
  19: The energy-usage shock formulation lacks micro-foundations. The authors are
    using TFP-damages as a measure of economic damage related to climate change.
  21: Higher carbon taxes could further mitigate climate change, but might require
    compensating current generations by extracting higher payments from future generations.
    The analysis does not consider state- or generation-contingent net taxes.
  23: The paper acknowledges a lack of scientific consensus on the value of equilibrium
    climate sensitivity and notes a significant range in estimates. Their climate
    model is described as simplistic, limiting its ability to realistically model
    stochastic climate sensitivity.
  24: The calibration of climate sensitivity is considered highly conservative, suggesting
    the actual uncertainty and potential for disasters are likely larger. The analysis
    focuses on an economy with 'dirty energy usage' and no carbon taxes.
  25: The model avoids pushing expected utility to negative infinity.
  27: The paper contrasts its approach to that of Golosov et al. (2014), who assume
    uncertainty is resolved at a specific future date, arguing that a stochastic evolution
    of values over time is more realistic.
  30: High carbon taxes at critical CO2 concentration levels might lead to consumption
    disasters.
  32: The paper argues that their results provide lower bounds on possible damages
    and on improving carbon taxes due to conservative parameter choices.

Quantitative material:
  2: Climate-risk tax can be as large or larger than the carbon average-damage tax
  3: The probability of a 'climate disaster' (defined as a consumption drop of more
    than one-third relative to trend) is over 7 percent over the next 250 years and
    9 percent over the next 500 years.
  5: Optimal carbon-risk taxation lowers the probability of a climate disaster from
    9 to 1 percent.
  6: 15 percent decline in long-run output under BAU.
  7: Defines a damage function based on temperature increase, with specific formulas
    for increases beyond a 3-degree Celsius tipping point.
  8: Initial generations gain about 0.1 percent in welfare. Generations born in 150
    years gain about 4 percent, generations born in 200 years gain 5 percent. Welfare
    gains then slowly flatten to about 3 percent in the very long run.
  9: Climate disaster probability increases to almost 9% with all three types of uncertainty.
    Fixed carbon-risk taxes can reduce this to around 3%. CO2-dependent taxes can
    reduce it below 1.5%.

  17: Maximum damages are less than 2.5 percent of final output; Maximum (excess)
    temperature is slightly below 2.8 degrees; Average return to capital is about
    3 percent per year; Optimal uniform carbon-tax of roughly 10 percent increases

    20 (100 years), 40 (200 years) and 100 (500 years) from 1500 simulations. Worst-case
    scenario where dirty energy production share stays at 0.88 for 60 model periods,
    but has probability of approximately 0.
  20: Reduction in GDP projected at 30 percent in worst-case scenario after 200 years.
  21: "Optimal fixed carbon tax rate: \u03C4 = 0.25 (25% tax on dirty energy). Welfare\
    \ gains with this tax rate: 1.5% in consumption equivalence for generations born\
    \ 200 years into the future, 0.1-0.5% for current and near-future generations,\
    \ reaching a maximum of 1.5% in 200 years, and about 1.3% in 175 years. Climate\
    \ disaster probability drops below 0.5%. Consumption disasters reduce aggregate\
    \ consumption by much more than one third."
  24: "Climate sensitivity parameter can take values \u03BB = 0.7\u03BB0 or \u03BB\
    \ = 1.3\u03BB0. Shocks (\u03F5\u03BB,t) can be -1/30 or +1/30 with equal probability.\
    \ In about 5 percent of the cases, aggregate consumption drops by more than one\
    \ third. These drops typically last more than 100 years, in some cases, up to\
    \ 350-400 years, and in some cases forever."
  25: Aggregate consumption never drops by more than two thirds.
  26: Optimal fixed tax rate on dirty energy is 20 percent; generations born 150 years
    from now or even later gain about 2 percent in certainty equivalence; probability
    of a climate disaster is reduced from more than 5 percent to around 2.5 percent;
    carbon tax is 5 percent lower than the one for the case of no climate uncertainty.
  27: The shock to the damage function can take values of -1/10 or +1/10 with equal
    probability. The probability of climate disasters increases to about 9 percent.
  29: Generations born in 200 years have a 7% lower expected utility (in consumption
    equivalents); a fixed carbon tax of 35% increases the welfare of generations born
    200 years in the future by around 4% (in consumption equivalents); climate disaster
    probability decreases to around 3.5% with the 35% tax.
  31: "Carbon tax rate (\u03C4t) is calculated using the formula: \u03C4t= 0 .3+ \
    \ (110 * max(0, (log(St/S)/log(2) \u22122))^3); Probability of climate disaster\
    \ is reduced to around 1.3 percent with a carbon tax that adjusts to climate change.\
    \ Fixed tax of 35 percent."
  32: "Generations born after 250 years gain slightly more, but the di\uFB00erences\
    \ are below 0.5 percent (under a carbon-risk tax scenario)"
