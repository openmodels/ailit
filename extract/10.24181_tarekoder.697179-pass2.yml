Drivers of Risk:
  1: Determinants of agricultural value added include GDP per capita, gross fixed
    capital formation, agricultural labor ratio, urbanization rate, and the rule of
    law index.
  2: GDP per capita, gross fixed capital formation, agricultural labor force rate,
    urbanization rate, rule of law index, political stability index
  8: Economic complexity is negatively correlated with agricultural value added.
  14: Per capita GDP, gross fixed capital formation, agricultural labor ratio, urbanization
    rate, political stability, rule of law.
  15: Natural conditions affecting agricultural productivity.
  19: The paper does not directly address climate change impacts, but it examines
    factors influencing value-added agriculture. Indirectly, natural conditions affecting
    crop production are mentioned as a risk.
Highlights:
  1: Positive and significant relationship found between agricultural value added
    and GDP per capita, gross fixed capital formation, agricultural labor ratio, and
    urbanization rate. Negative relationship found with the rule of law index.
  2: GDP per capita, gross fixed capital formation, agricultural labor force rate,
    and urbanization rate have a significant and positive relationship with value-added
    agriculture. Rule of law index has a significant and negative relationship with
    value-added agriculture. Political stability index has no statistically significant
    relationship with value-added agriculture.
  8: Improvement in agricultural value added due to increase in production efficiency
    and changes in product/process attributes influences GDP and has bidirectional
    causality with government effectiveness.
  14: Positive correlations found between agricultural value added and factors like
    GDP, capital formation, labor ratio, and urbanization.
  15: Positive relationship identified between agricultural added value and GDP per
    capita, gross fixed capital formation, agricultural labor ratio, and urbanization.
    Negative relationship noted between agricultural added value and rule of law index.
  19: Value-added agriculture has a statistically significant and positive relationship
    with GDP per capita, gross fixed capital formation, agricultural workforce ratio,
    and urbanization rate. A significant but negative relationship exists between
    value-added agriculture and the rule of law index. No statistically significant
    relationship was found between value-added agriculture and political stability.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis uses panel data econometric methods, specifically fixed effects
    model, random effects model, generalized method of moments (GMM), system GMM,
    and robust estimators, for 20 countries from 2000-2018.
  2: Panel data analysis method, fixed effects model, random effects model, generalized
    method of moments (GMM), system GMM, and robust (resistive error) estimators econometric
    models were used.
  8: Panel data analysis was used to assess factors affecting agricultural value added
    among 25-30 EU countries from 1995-2007 and in the E7 countries; Granger causality
    tests identified bidirectional causality between government effectiveness and
    agricultural value added.
  14: Analysis performed using fixed effects, random effects, GMM, and system GMM
    estimations from 2000-2018 across 20 countries.
  15: Panel data analysis using fixed effects, random effects, GMM, system GMM, and
    robust estimations on data from 2000-2018.
  19: Dynamic GMM, System GMM, Fixed Effects, and Random Effects models using panel
    data analysis.
More Notes:
  2: The data used is from the World Bank (WB) and Worldwide Governance Indicators
    (WGI) websites.
  19: The study suggests investments in technology and digitalization to increase
    value-added agriculture and productivity.
No relevant information:
  4: This page focuses on the general importance of agriculture, sustainable and organic
    farming practices, and their role in the economy. It does not provide any specific
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risk analysis related to climate change or adaptation
    costs and benefits at a national level.
  16: No relevant information
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: The study examines determinants of agricultural value added, which is indirectly
    related to GDP through agricultural contributions.
  2: Value-added agriculture
  8: Increase in agricultural value added contributes to per capita income among EU
    countries.
  14: Positive and significant relationship found between agricultural value added
    and gross fixed capital formation.
  15: Relationship between agricultural added value and macroeconomic factors like
    GDP per capita, influencing economic outcomes.
  19: Value-added agriculture (as a proxy for agricultural productivity).
Quantitative material:
  2: Panel data analysis using annual data of 20 selected countries for the period
    2000-2018.
  14: Agricultural value added significantly explained by independent variables with
    R-squared of 88%.
  19: Probability value is Probe> Chi square = 0.6692 from Hausman Test.
