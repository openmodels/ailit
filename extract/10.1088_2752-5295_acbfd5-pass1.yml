Drivers of Risk:
  3: Extreme monsoon rainfall, human-induced climate change, long-term variability
    in climate, inadequate infrastructure, socioeconomic vulnerabilities.
  9: "Annual maximum of the mean 60-day precipitation during June\u2013September,\
    \ over the Indus river basin and annual maximum of the mean 5-day precipitation\
    \ in June\u2013September over the Sindh and Balochistan provinces."
  11: Increased rainfall intensity in the Indus River basin due to global warming.
  13: "Increased likelihood and intensity of extreme rainfall events (60-day and 5-day)\
    \ due to climate change. Specifically, a shift from a 1.2\xB0C cooler climate.\
    \ Projected changes for a 0.8\xB0C warmer future are also considered."
  14: Heavy rainfall events and extensive flooding, exacerbated by failures in water
    management infrastructure, especially in downstream Pakistan.
Highlights:
  3: Pakistan experienced the worst flooding in its history due to extreme monsoon
    rainfall in summer 2022; it's infeasible to quantify the overall role of human-induced
    climate change due to model discrepancies and long-term variability; climate change
    has intensified rainfall; devastating impacts were also driven by non-climate
    factors.
  9: The study analyzes time series from the Indus basin and the combined provinces
    of Sindh and Balochistan of daily precipitation values.
  11: The paper provides estimates of changes in rainfall intensity and return periods
    in the Indus River basin due to climate change, with a focus on the 2022 event.
  13: "Climate models generally show an increase in both the likelihood and intensity\
    \ of extreme rainfall events (60-day and 5-day) with warming. Model projections\
    \ for a 0.8\xB0C warmer future show a statistically significant change for short-duration\
    \ events, with intensities increasing by 13%."
  14: The probability of extreme rainfall events is projected to increase, particularly
    in Balochistan and Sindh. Structural vulnerabilities and exposure, especially
    in downstream Pakistan, remain a significant challenge despite knowledge of flood
    patterns.
Methodology:
  3: Probabilistic event attribution methodology and detailed assessment of dynamics
    to understand the role of climate change; evaluation of climate models based on
    their ability to simulate rainfall characteristics.
  9: Uses a generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution that scales with global mean
    surface temperature (GMST) for both the 5-day and the 60-day event definitions.
    Analysis steps include trend calculation, model validation, multi-method multi-model
    attribution, and synthesis of the attribution statement.
  11: The analysis uses a GEV (Generalized Extreme Value) fit with constant dispersion
    parameters and location parameters scaling proportional to GMST, applied to gridded
    datasets (CPC, ERA5, IMERG) for the Indus river basin. It assesses probabilistic
    changes in rainfall intensity and return periods. The results apply to the Indus
    river basin. The analysis uses climate models, filtering them to select only 'good'
    or 'reasonable' models.
  13: "The study uses climate models to project changes in the likelihood and intensity\
    \ of extreme rainfall events under different warming scenarios, comparing them\
    \ to a 1.2\xB0C cooler climate. It synthesizes observational and model data."
  14: Comparing intensity change and probability ratios of heavy rainfall events under
    different climate scenarios using climate models.
More Notes:
  9: The study uses three datasets (CPC, ERA5, and IMERG) for computing observed return
    periods and synthesis, and CPC and ERA5 for model evaluation.
  11: "The paper includes supplementary material (S3) with additional results, including\
    \ tables of results for individual models and graphical representations of probability\
    \ ratios (PRs) and intensity changes. The analysis compares a climate of 2\xB0\
    C of global warming with today's 1.2\xB0C world."
  13: "The models show large discrepancies, especially regarding the 0.8\xB0C warmer\
    \ future projections. The analysis focuses on the Indus river basin and the region\
    \ encompassing Balochistan and Sindh. The analysis does not explicitly link the\
    \ rainfall events to macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes."
  14: The projected changes in rainfall intensity are compatible with but slightly
    larger than expectations based on the Clausius-Clapeyron relationship. The models
    used project a high increase, adding confidence, but the literature generally
    encompasses a larger region with less natural variability, rendering reliable
    quantitative projections difficult.

    events in Pakistan, with no direct mention of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes,
    costs, or benefits of adaptation.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  3: Devastating impacts due to proximity of human settlements, infrastructure, and
    agricultural land to floodplains, inadequate infrastructure, limited ex-ante risk
    reduction capacity, outdated river management system, and underlying vulnerabilities
    driven by high poverty rates and socioeconomic factors.

Quantitative material:

    s probability) and change in intensity of the event. Return period curves for\
    \ present, 2022, and past climates (1.2 degrees C cooler). Precipitation data\
    \ from CPC (1979-present), ERA5 (1950-present) and IMERG (2000-present)."
  11: The paper quantifies changes in rainfall intensity and return periods for different
    global mean surface temperatures (GMST) for the Indus River basin, including the
    2022 event. Includes an analysis of rainfall under a 1.2 degree C cooler climate
    and a 2 degree C warmer climate.
  14: "Intensity change and probability ratios for heavy rainfall events over the\
    \ Indus river basin and Balochistan/Sindh regions are compared to a 0.8\xB0C warmer\
    \ climate (2\xB0C since pre-industrial).  Specifically, a 40% increase in the\
    \ probability of a 100-year 5-day heavy rainfall event in Balochistan and Sindh."
