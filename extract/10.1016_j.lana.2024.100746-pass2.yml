Drivers of Risk:
  2: Changing climatic conditions, warming trend, changes in ecosystems.
  3: Weather-related extreme events, including floods and landslides in Brazil.
  4: Heatwaves, wildfires, vector-borne diseases, air pollution from fossil fuels,
    fossil fuel subsidies, lack of intersectoral public policies for climate resilience,
    inadequate climate finance, dependence on political cycles, lagging progress on
    the climate agenda
  6: "Climate change; El Ni\xF1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO); Exposure to warming;\
    \ Exposure of vulnerable populations to heatwaves; Wildfires; Climate suitability\
    \ for infectious disease transmission; Emissions from agricultural production\
    \ and consumption; Tree cover loss; Air pollution; Energy use, energy generation."
  7: Heatwaves represent a sustained period (two or more days) with unusually high
    ambient temperatures during the day or night; High ambient temperatures challenge
    the human body by affecting the physiological responses, resulting in a high risk
    of heat stress; Population exposure to extreme heat is associated with multiple
    negative health outcomes, ranging from general discomfort and headaches to heat
    stroke and death; The risk of heat stress also increases due to inadequate behavioural
    and social responses, which are mostly linked to social factors that allow appropriate
    behaviour to reduce the risk of heat stress (i.e., access to adequate housing
    insulation and ventilation, cooling centres, and urban green spaces)
  8: Rising temperatures, droughts, and climate change leading to increased heat stress
    and wildfire danger.
  9: Climate change influences the transmission potential of vector- and water-borne
    diseases, including dengue fever and vibriosis; increased frequency of very/extremely
    high fire danger days
  10: Higher frequency of heatwave days and drought months.
  14: Climate change is a driver of risk, specifically impacting the suitability for
    transmission of Aedes-borne diseases and dengue fever outbreaks.
  20: Agriculture (commodity driven deforestation and shifting agriculture) and related
    land use changes are significant drivers of environmental impact. Increased CO2e
    emissions per capita in some Latin American countries are associated with the
    production of cow and buffalo meat.
  22: Climate change-induced extreme weather events (droughts, floods, wildfires,
    hurricanes) damaging infrastructure and disrupting low-carbon and renewable energy
    production; droughts reducing hydropower generation leading to increased fossil
    fuel usage; a decrease in mean hydropower capacity factor due to climate change;
    health impacts of climate change increasing healthcare costs, reducing labor capacity,
    and generating economic losses from damaged infrastructure and disrupted services
    and supply chains.
  23: Weather-related extreme events and heat exposure affecting labor productivity.
  24: Heat-related labor capacity reduction is impacting the outcomes.
  26: Climate change inaction; Temperature changes leading to mortality and morbidity;
    Unquantified health effects from wildfires, contaminated food and water, extreme
    meteorological events; Shifts in event frequency and severity.
  29: Climate change worsening, extreme events, misinformation surrounding health
    crises (infodemic)
  30: Extreme heat, dengue transmission potential increase, floods, and landslides
    are impacting economic losses.
  31: Fossil fuel burning contributes to climate change, causes environmental damage,
    and results in significant air pollution.
Highlights:
  2: Latin American populations continue to observe a growing exposure to changing
    climatic conditions, with severe direct impacts on health.
  3: Significant economic costs from climate change with slow progress in investment
    in mitigation and adaptation measures.
  4: Urgent action to implement intersectoral public policies that enhance climate
    resilience; Prioritise an energy transition that focuses on health co-benefits
    and wellbeing; Increasing climate finance
  6: Overlapping climatic hazards (climate change and ENSO) may trigger devastating
    consequences to populations, including their health and wellbeing, economies,
    and the environment.
  7: "In the 2013\u20132022 period, infants and people older than 65 years experienced,\
    \ on average, 248% and 271% more days of heatwave per year than in 1986\u2013\
    2005, respectively"
  8: Significant increases in heat-related mortality and heat stress impacting outdoor
    work capacity across Latin America; Increased wildfire danger in many Latin American
    countries.
  9: Dengue transmission potential has increased significantly in Latin America due
    to climate change; the coastline suitable for Vibrio spp. is also increasing,
    posing public health risks
  10: A changing climate is negatively impacting population health in Latin America,
    underscoring the urgency of accelerating adaptation efforts.
  14: The risk of mosquito-borne diseases has decreased overall in Latin America,
    but there is considerable temporal variation within and between countries.
  20: Agriculture and food consumption patterns significantly contribute to CO2e emissions
    in Latin America, with animal-based products being a major source. There are associated
    health co-benefits from shifting to nutritious plant-based diets.
  22: Climate change and extreme weather events pose significant macroeconomic and
    fiscal risks by impacting energy production, increasing healthcare costs, and
    reducing labor capacity.
  23: Economic losses largely uninsured; substantial GDP losses from heat-related
    labor capacity reductions in sectors such as agriculture and construction.
  24: Clean energy investment in Latin America exceeded fossil fuel investment by
    13% in 2022, indicating a shift towards mitigating climate risks.
  26: Climate change inaction poses a significant threat to social development progress
    and a huge obstacle for Latin American countries to continue progressing; News
    articles including climate change and health-related keywords reached a record
    in 2022; Social media posts related to health and climate change increased by
    410% from 2017 to 2022.
  29: "Engagement of corporations with health was high across all Latin American countries\
    \ (86%), followed by engagement with climate (72%). Engagement with the intersection\
    \ of health and climate change is still low (39%), although a signi\uFB01 cant\
    \ increment has been observed since 2011 (12%)."
  30: Latin America is lagging in transitioning to a zero-carbon future, and increased
    extreme heat and disease transmission are significant risks.
  31: Transition to renewable energy and healthier food systems offers economic and
    health benefits, while reducing fossil fuel subsidies and air pollution.
Methodology:
  4: The 2023 Lancet Countdown Latin America report underscores the cascading and
    compounding health impacts of anthropogenic climate change.
  7: This indicator tracks population exposure to heatwaves in Latin American countries
    based on data from the 2023 global Lancet Countdown report; estimates the risk
    of heat stress during physical activity based on daily ambient temperature and
    relative humidity together with the intensity of the physical activity and clothing
    worn
  9: Analysis compares climatic suitability for disease transmission (dengue, Vibrio
    spp.) between different time periods; analyzes changes in fire danger days
  10: The food insecurity analysis combines data from the Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) with the frequency of heatwaves
    days and drought months (SPEI-12) using a time-varying panel regression.  The
    analysis is applicable to Latin America.
  14: The Mosquito Risk Index (MoRI) estimates the risk of mosquito-transmitted diseases
    by combining hazard, vulnerability, exposure and resilience indicators. Data was
    retrieved in September 2023.
  20: The analysis draws from the 2023 global Lancet Countdown report. It analyzes
    the CO2e emissions from local consumption and production of different food products.
  22: Indicators are used to track the economic impacts of climate change and monitor
    the economics of the transition to zero-carbon economies. Specific details on
    the methods and additional analyses are in Section 4 of the Appendix.
  23: Analysis uses data from the Swiss Re Institute and the global Lancet Countdown
    report, tracking insured and uninsured economic losses from weather-related events
    and heat-related labor capacity loss.
  26: Analysis of news articles in leading newspapers from ten Latin American countries
    included keywords related to 'climate change' and 'climate change and health'
    between 2007 and 2022; Analysis of Facebook posts related to health and climate
    change in 17 Latin American countries from 2017 to 2022.
  29: Draws from the 2023 global Lancet Countdown report and tracks mentions of climate
    change and health terms in the Global Compact Communication of Progress (GCCOP)
    reports.
More Notes:
  2: The study highlights the need for intersectoral public policies, robust vulnerability
    and adaptation assessments, and increased collaboration between meteorological
    and health sectors. Funding for climate change adaptation projects in Latin America
    has decreased, with none directed toward climate change and health projects in
    2022.
  4: The report emphasizes the cascading and compounding health impacts of anthropogenic
    climate change in Latin America.
  6: The page presents indicators of the 2023 Latin America report of the Lancet Countdown,
    focusing on health hazards, exposures, and impacts, adaptation planning, mitigation
    actions, and economics and finance related to climate change. It emphasizes the
    potentiating effects of multiple and interacting climatic hazards and the importance
    of building climate resilience through an intersectoral, integral, and holistic
    approach.
  7: No relevant information
  8: The study focuses on recent trends (2000s-2022) and uses data from the Lancet
    Countdown report. The figures indicate a heterogeneous impact across countries.
  9: The paper links climatic conditions to the incidence of dengue fever. Mentions
    that some countries have small reductions in fire exposure, which may be due to
    adaptation policies, social behaviors, or other factors like deforestation.
  14: The fraction destined for potentially improving health adaptation remains at
    11.6% of the total approved funding.
  20: The analysis identifies countries with higher production-based vs. consumption-based
    emissions, suggesting the local environmental impact of exported products. The
    mention of 870,000 deaths related to poor diet may indicate a cost of inaction.
  26: "There is a high degree of uncertainty about the effects of climate change under\
    \ different climate scenarios; The quality of data in less developed areas, including\
    \ Latin America, is of special concern; Regional climate responses to El Ni\xF1\
    o and La Ni\xF1a are more uncertain in poorer regions."
  29: "The page discusses the need for clear and trustable communication between authorities,\
    \ in\uFB02uencers, media, corporations, scientists, and the public for climate-resilient\
    \ development pathways and prosperous societies."
  31: Intersectoral public policies that increase climate resilience, reduce social
    inequities, and improve population health are needed in Latin America.
