  5: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  3: Heat extremes, agricultural and hydrological droughts, wildfires, and river floods
    are increasing in the UK due to climate change.
  5: High emissions through the 21st century and global greenhouse gas emissions.
  6: Climate risk represented by discrete hazardous events and potential variation
    in climate resource from expected values
  8: "Increased likelihood of days with maximum temperatures exceeding 32\xB0C during\
    \ wheat flowering, increased proportion of time SPEI6 is below -1.5 (drought),\
    \ increased wildfire hazard (average days with 'exceptional' fire danger warning\
    \ or high FFMC), increased likelihood of exceeding the 10-year flood event, Standardised\
    \ Streamflow Index as proxy for water resources drought frequency."
  9: Different RCP emissions scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP6.0, RCP8.5) are used to project
    future climate. The HadGEM3 model tends to produce higher temperature changes
    and greater reductions in precipitation in England and Wales compared to CMIP5
    projections.
  13: Increasing temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and their impact on drought,
    floods, heat stress, and wildfire danger across the UK.
  14: Temperature extremes, Rainfall uncertainty (affecting MOFSI indicator)
  16: "RCP8.5 emissions scenario, HadGEM3 and CMIP5 global ensembles, Global Warming,\
    \ temperature increases (above 2\xB0C, 7\xB0C, 25\xB0C, 30\xB0C), adverse weather"
  18: RCP8.5 emissions scenario leading to changes in extreme heatwaves, heat-health
    alerts, cooling degree days, temperature records, droughts, river and pluvial
    flooding, flood impact, and sea level rise.
  24: High, medium, and low emissions scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP6.0, RCP8.5) leading to
    different temperature increases by 2100. Specifically, the pathways leading to
    2, 3, and 4 degree increases.
  25: "Climate hazards will increase across the whole of the UK \u2013 in the absence\
    \ of adaptation - but at different rates and from different starting values in\
    \ different regions."
Highlights:
  3: Demand for cooling energy will rise, whereas demand for heating energy will decline.
  5: The paper addresses what the risks are with high emissions through the 21st century
    and across sectors in the UK, and what the effects of reductions in global greenhouse
    gas emissions are on risks in the UK.
  6: Use of indicators to represent changes in hazard and resource due to climate
    change without directly mapping onto impacts
  8: A range of agri-climate, wildfire, flood risk, and water resource drought indicators
    are calculated, but the study omits indicators directly relevant to the natural
    environment, coastal zone, extreme storms/gales, or compound events.
  13: Significant increase in temperature-related risks, increase in likelihood of
    heat-health alerts and adverse weather days, and substantial increases in agricultural
    drought times are noted.
  14: Observed climate hazards and resources mapped across the UK from 1981-2010 including
    heatwaves, heat-health alerts, temperature degree days, transport/rail network
    risk, growing degree days, wheat heat stress and wildfire danger days.
  16: The plots quantify the changes in climate-related indicators relevant to heat,
    energy, and transport across different regions of the UK. The changes show expected
    increases or decreases in certain risk metrics, like more heat-health alert days
    and fewer heating degree days.
  18: Significant increases are projected in most climate indicators, signaling intensified
    climate change impacts over time in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.
  24: Reducing emissions lowers, but doesn't eliminate widespread increases in climate
    risk indicators. The effect of reducing emissions varies between indicators and
    across the UK. Until the 2040s the difference between emissions projections is
    small, but after that, high emission risks can be considerably greater. Adaptation
    and resilience strategies need to consider high emissions scenarios and sensitive
    climate models.
Methodology:
  3: Analysis includes evaluating changes across health, transport, energy, agriculture,
    and water sectors without explicit adaptation.
  5: "The approach involves the calculation of policy-relevant indicators of climate\
    \ risk using UKCP18 climate projections. It uses the delta method to apply different\
    \ types of UKCP18 climate projections to observed HadUK-Grid climate data, and\
    \ the reference period is 1981\u20132010."
  6: 'Indicators developed based on 7 characteristics of climate hazard or resource:
    magnitude, duration, frequency, likelihood, variability, timing, and spatial extent,
    using thresholds to express hazard/resource'
  8: Agri-climate indicators are calculated, including growing season length, potential
    soil moisture deficit, low/high temperatures, drought, and soil workability; Wildfire
    hazard is characterized using the Met Office Fire Severity System (MOFSI); Hydrological
    modeling using the UKCEH Grid-to-Grid model (G2G) and a simpler hydrological model
    by Gosling and Arnell (2010).
  9: The study uses the UKCP18 climate projections over land, including probabilistic,
    global, and regional strands. Probabilistic projections are at 25x25km resolution
    for RCP2.6, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios. Global projections are at 60x60km
    using variants of the HadGEM3 model and CMIP5 models, under the RCP8.5 pathway.
    Regional projections are at 12x12km based on HadGEM3 variants. A delta approach
    is used to apply climate projections to daily observed climate data.
  13: Analysis utilizes HadGEM3 and CMIP5 climate projections to estimate changes
    in various risk indicators (e.g., temperature extremes, droughts, floods).
  14: Analysis based on observed climate hazards and resources from 1981-2010, spatial
    aggregation to regional boundaries
  16: The analysis uses climate risk indicators calculated from the HadGEM3 and CMIP5
    global ensembles under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario. The data are presented as
    30-year means, plotted at the mid-point of the 30-year period. Shading indicates
    the range across ensemble members (excluding the highest and lowest), and the
    solid line represents the median. Bars show the full range for each ensemble.
  18: Analysis is performed via projections using the HadGEM3 and CMIP5 global ensembles.
    Results are applicable to assessing future climate change impacts under the RCP8.5
    scenario.
  24: Uses UKCP18 probabilistic climate projections under different emissions scenarios
    (RCP2.6, RCP6.0, RCP8.5). Assesses risk indicators across the UK nations, using
    hydrological models. Includes global strand projections from UKCP18.
More Notes:
  3: Reducing emissions provides long-term risk reduction but little short-term impact;
    resilience measures and policies targeting net zero emissions by 2050 are recommended.
  6: Focus on indicators of changes in climate hazard and resource, including health
    and well-being impacts and energy demand proxies
  8: The hydrological indicators are relatively insensitive to assumed differences
    in changes in rainfall intensity; the study applies monthly precipitation changes
    to daily data and does not therefore account for potential additional increases
    in the intensity of heavy rainfall.
  9: The probabilistic projections may not be spatially-coherent. The HadGEM3-based
    projections are increasingly used for assessing storm frequency and atmospheric
    circulation patterns. While RCP8.5 is debated, the study argues it should still
    be included, especially for the latter part of the 21st century, as a 'worst case'
    emission scenario.
  13: The paper differentiates between indicators based on local critical thresholds
    and absolute critical thresholds with implications on how geographic variation
    affects changes in these indicators.
  14: The HadGEM3 projections have consistently larger increases in temperature than
    the CMIP5 projections, which primarily drives the differences between the two
    ensembles.
  16: The table 4 referenced is likely to contain more details on definitions and
    scope of the work. The focus is on physical risks.
  18: Table 4 provides definitions of the climate risk indicators used in the analysis.
  24: The uncertainty range for wildfire indicators may be overestimated. Adaptation
    and resilience priorities will vary within the UK. The effects of emissions reduction
    measures won't be seen for a couple of decades.
