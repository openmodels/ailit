Drivers of Risk:
  12: Increase in thermal time requirement
  13: Inherent biophysical uncertainties related to climate and multiple stresses
    affecting crop management.
  16: Climate change (temperature, humidity), Soil type, Land-use pressure, Deforestation
    and associated carbon debt, Cost of inputs (e.g. fertiliser), Sale price of produce
  22: Doubled-CO2 (current climate)
Highlights:
  13: Adaptation requires a holistic approach that goes beyond biophysics and considers
    how crops are managed by people under multiple stresses.
  22: No relevant information
Methodology:
  13: Risk management approach to adaptation considering biophysical uncertainties.
  16: Crop Model
  22: QUMP simulationsruns carried out, GLAM simulations, Present-day and doubled-CO
    grid cell used, Climate model parameters varied one at a time using expert opinion
    to determine the values, 20-year time series, parameter perturbations
More Notes:
  13: The page emphasizes the importance of considering human management and multiple
    stresses in addition to biophysical factors when addressing climate change adaptation
    in agriculture.
  16: The page seems to outline a framework for analyzing the links between climate
    change, agricultural production, and farmer adaptation. It highlights the importance
    of linking natural and social sciences in the analysis.
  22: The GLAM model is used with varied climate model parameters. Simulations are
    performed under both baseline and doubled CO2 conditions.

  6: This page appears to be an unedited excerpt with several errors and omissions
    and does not contribute any standalone insights. The text is fragmented and incomplete,
    with many errors and missing information. It is not possible to derive complete
    insights without the full, properly formatted text.
  7: This page focuses on biophysical processes impacting crop yields and model uncertainty,
    without mentioning macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes.
  11: This page primarily discusses modeling approaches and data sources for adaptation
    strategies, but does not provide quantitative results, specific risk drivers,
    macroeconomic/fiscal outcomes, or costs/benefits of adaptation at a national level.
  18: This page does not contain any information relevant to the categories specified.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  12: Yield change
  13: No relevant information
  16: Food security
  22: No relevant information
Quantitative material:
  12: Graph suggests 20% change in yield with a corresponding increase in thermal
    time requirement
  13: No relevant information
  22: 12,720 baseline GLAM simulations, 57,240 doubled CO
