Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea-level rise (SLR), storms, flooding, and policies influencing coastal management.
  2: Sea level rise (SLR), storm risk, beach erosion
  4: Sea level rise (SLR), beach nourishment, and agent (resident) flux.
  5: The primary driver of risk is sea-level rise (SLR), exacerbated by a reduction
    in beach nourishment subsidies from 90% to 50% starting at year 50 of the simulation.
  6: Sea Level Rise (SLR), appreciation of outside markets
  7: Sea level rise (SLR) beginning at year 50. Decline in outside markets (defined
    as markets in other locations).
  8: Sea-level rise (SLR), outside property market fluctuations, tax policy, beach
    nourishment subsidies.
  9: Erosion, sea level rise, and storms affect the risks and values of coastal real
    estate. Exposure to storm risk and flood hazards tend to decrease home values.
  10: Climate change impacts the model through storm risk (affecting property values)
    and beach nourishment (managed by communities to enhance recreational value and
    provide storm protection).
  11: The drivers of risk include beach width (affected by erosion and nourishment),
    mean sea level (MSL) rise, and storms.
  12: Risk of oceanfront property, episodic storms, sea level rise, demographic change
  13: Sea level rise and shoreline retreat are drivers of risk that affect property
    values.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Coastal property values and demographic transitions in coastal communities.
  2: Property values in coastal and inland counties in the U.S.
  4: Property value, beach width, share of housing owned by investors, expected rate
    of return on coastal real estate, marginal income tax rate of property owners,
    and risk premium for coastal real estate.
  5: The analysis evaluates the impact of reduced beach nourishment subsidies on property
    values, beach width, income tax rates, and investor market share in coastal areas
    facing sea-level rise (SLR).
  6: Property value, beach width, income tax rate of property owners, and investor
    market share
  7: Property value, beach width, share of housing owned by investors, expected rate
    of return on coastal real estate, marginal income tax rate of property owners,
    and risk premium for coastal real estate.
  8: Persistence of high property values in coastal areas vulnerable to sea-level
    rise (SLR).
  9: Property values and real estate markets in coastal areas are evaluated.
  10: This model evaluates the impact of climate change (specifically storm risk and
    beach nourishment) on coastal housing markets, focusing on equilibrium price and
    investor market share.
  11: This paper evaluates the willingness to pay to live at the beach as affected
    by beach width and sea level rise.
  12: Property price
  13: This paper evaluates property values and beach nourishment decisions in the
    context of climate change.
Highlights:
  1: Policy and market forces delay real estate price declines on the US coast. Subsidies
    dampen the effects of SLR on coastal property values, but only temporarily. Removing
    subsidies would more accurately reflect risks but could lead to coastal gentrification.
    There is a policy tradeoff between slowing demographic transitions and allowing
    markets to adjust smoothly to climate change risks.
  2: Subsidies for coastal management dampen the impacts of SLR on coastal property
    markets, but the effects are transitory and only delay price declines as total
    inundation approaches. Prices would more accurately reflect SLR risks without
    subsidies.
  4: SLR initially causes a modest decline in property values, with a substantial
    decline taking decades to manifest. The influx of high-income agents can temporarily
    dampen the property value decline. Without agent flux, SLR translates into an
    immediate decline in property values. Eventually, the investor market share declines
    to zero.
  5: Reducing nourishment subsidies leads to volatility and a precipitous decline
    in property values (especially oceanfront), an immediate decline in beach width,
    an increase in median owner income tax rate, and a decrease in investor ownership
    of housing.
  6: Rising outside markets can offset the removal of subsidies related to climate
    adaptation in the long run. Rising prices can drive investors out of the market
    quickly as relatively high-income owners enter sooner. The influx of relatively
    high-income agents and higher prices can eventually justify even more frequent
    nourishment and wider beaches.
  7: When outside markets decline, expected returns and property values plummet sharply,
    and risk continues to increase despite continued nourishment and maintenance of
    beach width. Relatively high-income owners leave the market, investors buy all
    the real estate, and rent it to lower-income occupants. Coastal communities attract
    wealthier residents despite growing risks from climate change, representing a
    form of coastal gentrification.
  8: Tax policies and outside markets can dampen the climate signal on coastal property
    values. Beach nourishment subsidies delay downward adjustments in real estate
    markets and demographic shifts and fail to promote adaptation in the long run.
  9: Public investments in adaptation and risk mitigation capitalize into real estate
    prices. Federal subsidies for beach nourishment can even create a bubble in coastal
    real estate markets.
  10: The model focuses on the interaction between individual agents (homeowners and
    investors) and community decisions (beach nourishment) to determine equilibrium
    house prices and market share in the face of climate change.
  11: The paper highlights how beach width influences an agent's willingness to pay
    to live at the beach, and how a risk premium associated with SLR and storms exerts
    downward pressure on property values.
  13: The study models the decision-making process of communities regarding beach
    nourishment, considering the trade-off between property tax increases and property
    value appreciation in the face of shoreline retreat.
Methodology:
  1: The Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM) incorporates changing physical attributes
    of the coast, economic values of these attributes, and dynamic risks associated
    with storms and flooding. The coupled system explores how subsidies for coastal
    management, tax advantages, and property values outside the coastal zone affect
    coastal property values. Results are applicable to long-term trends in US coastal
    real estate markets.
  2: Uses a first-stage hedonic price function that estimates the natural log of property
    sales price, controlling for property characteristics. Coupled systems modeling
    is used to understand the interaction between real estate markets and the physical
    coastal system over a long time horizon.
  4: A baseline model simulation examines the impacts of SLR and beach nourishment
    on oceanfront and non-oceanfront properties. The model considers agent flux (migration
    of high-income individuals) and stable outside property markets. The model starts
    with housing in dynamic equilibrium and analyzes scenarios with and without agent
    flux to assess the impact on property values. Results are applicable to barrier
    islands.
  5: The analysis uses a numerical experiment and model simulation comparing a baseline
    scenario with a scenario where the nourishment subsidy rate is cut to 50% at the
    onset of SLR (t=50). The model simulates outcomes over a 100-year period of SLR.
  6: Numerical experiment using a model to simulate differences between a baseline
    scenario and a scenario where outside markets appreciate. SLR begins at t = 50.
  7: Model simulations of coastal real estate markets coupled to the physical environment,
    incorporating beach nourishment, local public finance decisions, and storm risk.
    The model adds how SLR drives local real estate market responses and demographic
    changes. Results are applicable when outside markets decline after the onset of
    SLR.
  8: Uses a coupled human-natural system model (C-HOM) to compare business-as-usual
    with alternative coastal management approaches. The applicability timeframe is
    not explicitly stated, but focuses on long-run effects.
  9: The paper uses a coupled human-natural systems model (C-HOM) combining theoretical,
    numerical modeling, and empirical literature. It employs an asset-price approach
    linked to capitalized housing market rent and agent-based modeling to capture
    nonlinearities and heterogeneity. Applicable to coastal housing markets.
  10: The paper uses an agent-based model (C-HOM) to simulate coastal housing markets.
    The model is calibrated to US housing market characteristics and considers the
    impact of homeowner tax deductions. The model has a spatial resolution smaller
    than a town but larger than a census block group. It simulates decisions related
    to beach nourishment funded by property taxes.
  11: The analysis uses a user cost framework and includes a risk premium term to
    account for the impacts of sea level rise and storms on property values, effectively
    augmenting the discount rate. It includes agent-specific parameters and allows
    for heterogeneous climate beliefs.
  12: Agent-based model of coastal real estate markets accounting for demographic
    changes and interactions with outside markets. Agents form heterogeneous expectations
    of capital gains based on past market returns.
  13: The analysis uses an agent-based model where agents (homeowners and institutional
    investors) vote on beach nourishment plans based on a cost-benefit analysis of
    property tax burden versus property value increase. The model considers factors
    such as shoreline retreat rate, sand quantity needed for nourishment, and discounting
    of future costs. The model was coded and run in Matlab R2022b.
More Notes:
  1: The study finds that despite increasing risks from SLR and storms, US coastal
    communities continue to attract high-income residents, and coastal property values
    continue to rise. This seemingly paradoxical behavior is explored using the C-HOM
    model.
  2: The study uses data from 23,184,659 property sales in the United States between
    1989 and 2016. The study examines the impact of local adaptation measures on coastal
    housing markets.
  4: Justifications for the scenarios are in the Supplemental Materials. Property
    value fluctuations are more pronounced in oceanfront properties due to the greater
    effect of beach width. High-income agents have higher bid prices due to higher
    marginal income tax rates.
  6: The study also models the case where subsidies are reduced and outside markets
    rise, and explores the influence of declining outside markets.
  7: The coupled human-natural system dampens environmental signals and delays the
    full capitalization of risk from SLR, potentially explaining why coastal property
    values continue to rise as climate-related risks increase in the present and near
    future.
  8: Highlights a potential tradeoff between coastal management that discourages gentrification
    and management that allows prices to reflect long-run risks. Suggests exploring
    buyouts with rentbacks as a policy approach. The same community can experience
    both coastal gentrification and climate gentrification, occurring during distinct
    periods of time.
  9: The model incorporates feedbacks between the natural system (erosion, SLR, storms)
    and human system (responses like beach nourishment). The model accounts for heterogeneity
    in risk preferences across owners, renters, and institutional investors.
  10: The model assumes a fixed supply of housing, reflecting built-out coastal communities,
    and focuses on the impact of storm risk on property values rather than episodic
    damage. The model simplifies vacation rentals and assumes owner agents are indifferent
    to owning vs renting.
  11: The risk premium term includes background risk, oceanfront risk, storm risk,
    and sea level rise risk, modified by a risk multiplier that combines individual
    beliefs and tolerance.
  13: The model does not explicitly model dune building but assumes its benefits and
    costs are captured implicitly in nourishment decisions. Investor's expected capital
    gain in each period is the median of owner expected capital gains.
Quantitative material:
  1: The paper analyzes the long-term evolution of coastal real estate markets using
    the Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM).
  2: Figure 1 shows quality-adjusted baseline housing values in coastal (blue) and
    inland (black) counties in the United States between 2000 and 2015.
  4: Property values, beach width, investor share of housing, expected return rate,
    income tax rate, and risk premium are shown over a 150-year period (SLR begins
    at year 50). Beach nourishment is subsidized at 90% of the cost. Initial barrier
    height is 1m for the first 50 years, with SLR rising 1m over the remaining 100
    years, leading to a barrier height of 0m relative to mean sea level at year 150.
  5: Percent change in property value for oceanfront and non-oceanfront properties;
    Difference in beach width in meters; Difference in income tax rate; Difference
    in investor market share.
  6: 'Percent change in property value, difference in beach width (m), difference
    in income tax rate, difference in investor market share. Example: Coastal real
    estate prices appreciate well after the onset of SLR and, after 100 years, remain
    above baseline prices even as barrier elevation approaches zero (Fig. 5a).'
  7: Simulations show property value decreasing sharply after year 50 when SLR begins
    and outside markets decline. The investor share of housing reaches 100% after
    roughly 30 years following SLR onset when outside markets decline.
  8: Cumulative federal expenditures on beach nourishment projects have exceeded 12
    billion USD in the past century (in 2022 dollars).
  9: No specific quantitative results are presented on this page, but the paper uses
    models that would produce such data.
  10: The model uses equations to calculate the user cost of housing (Eq. 3) and agent's
    rental bid (Eq. 4).
  11: "The paper includes equations for beach width change (bwt+1 = bwt /C0 \u03C8\
    bw + \u0394t) and MSL change (MSLt+1 = MSLt + \u03C8SL), as well as an equation\
    \ for willingness to pay (WTPj,t = WTP basej + \u03B1j E[bwt+1]/C138 \u03B2)."
  12: "Equations for calculating risk premiums (rOF, rSt, rSL), agent distribution\
    \ adjustments (At), and adjustments to WTPbase and \u03B1U based on external markets."
  13: "The paper presents equations for calculating the total cost of loan repayment\
    \ for beach nourishment (TCYi), additional property tax rate (\u03C4p,add), and\
    \ the cost of a nourishment event (cost(t)). It also simulates property values\
    \ via a user cost model."
