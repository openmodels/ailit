Drivers of Risk:
  1: Sea-level rise (SLR) and storms are the primary drivers of risk.
  3: Sea Level Rise (SLR), storm risk, the influence of competing property markets.
  4: Sea level rise (SLR) beginning at year 50, beach erosion, and beach nourishment.
  5: Sea level rise (SLR), reduction in beach nourishment subsidies.
  10: Climate change impacts on coastal housing markets, specifically storm risk and
    beach width reduction.
  11: Sea Level Rise (SLR), storms, erosion, climate beliefs, risk tolerance
  13: Shoreline retreat due to climate change, nourishment costs, beach width.
Highlights:
  1: Subsidies for coastal management, tax advantages for high-income property owners,
    and stable property values outside the coastal zone dampen the effects of SLR
    on coastal property values, but only temporarily delay precipitous declines.
  3: Study the evolution of coastal real estate markets, incomes, and shoreline management
    in response to SLR. Explore mechanisms that allow a coastal community to delay
    the inevitable collapse of a coastal real estate market.
  4: SLR leads to a modest initial decline in property values, with a substantial
    decline occurring decades later. High-income agents entering the market can temporarily
    dampen the property value decline. Without agent flux, SLR translates into an
    immediate decline in property value.
  5: Reducing beach nourishment subsidies leads to volatility and a precipitous decline
    in property values, especially for oceanfront properties. It also causes an immediate
    decline in beach width, followed by leveling off and resumption of nourishment.
    The median owner income tax rate increases with lower nourishment subsidies. Investors
    own substantially less of the housing with lower nourishment subsidies.
  10: The model examines how climate change and beach management strategies impact
    property values and investment decisions in coastal communities.
  11: Property values are influenced by the interplay of physical climate risks (SLR,
    storms, erosion), agent beliefs about these risks, and risk tolerance.
  13: The model evaluates the costs and benefits of beach nourishment plans, considering
    the impact on property values and property taxes. A nourishment plan is implemented
    if at least 50% of resident-owner agents vote in favor.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis is performed using the Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM), which
    incorporates physical attributes of the coast, economic values, and dynamic risks
    associated with storms and flooding to analyze the long-term evolution of coastal
    real estate markets.
  3: Development of a Coastal Home Ownership Model (C-HOM) to simulate a coupled human-natural
    system over a 150-year time horizon.
  4: Agent-based model simulation analyzing the impact of SLR and beach nourishment
    on property values and socioeconomic characteristics in a coastal community. The
    baseline scenario assumes outside property prices are constant and agent flux
    is turned on (migration of high-income agents).
  5: Numerical experiment involving model simulation comparing a baseline scenario
    with a scenario where the nourishment subsidy rate is cut to 50% at the onset
    of SLR (t=50).
  10: Agent-based model (C-HOM) simulating a coastal property market with owner agents
    and investor agents. User cost of housing model informs agent behavior. The model
    considers government subsidies and self-financing, community management of beaches,
    and differences between oceanfront and non-oceanfront markets.
  11: Agent-based model simulating housing market dynamics with factors such as willingness
    to pay, risk perception, and investor behavior. The model considers beach width,
    sea level, and the impact of these factors on property values.
  13: An agent-based model simulates property values with and without beach nourishment.
    Agents vote on nourishment plans based on whether the property value increase
    is greater than the extra tax burden. The model incorporates expected capital
    gains, shoreline retreat, nourishment costs, and property taxes. The model was
    coded and run in Matlab R2022b.
More Notes:
  1: The paper identifies a policy tradeoff between slowing demographic transitions
    in coastal communities and allowing property markets to adjust smoothly to risks
    from climate change.
  3: Model considers agent actions (buying/selling property, voting, beach management)
    and the physical system (erosion, beach width) with feedbacks. Scenarios explore
    different levels of beach nourishment subsidies and appreciation/depreciation
    of outside property markets.
  4: The initial 50-year period characterizes the system without SLR. The model considers
    the impact of SLR on housing risk and investor behavior. Fluctuations in shoreline
    position due to erosion and nourishment impact property values and expected returns,
    particularly for oceanfront properties.
  5: The baseline scenario demonstrates that property values do not immediately reflect
    SLR risks, and that risk, investment, and income interact to obscure the signal
    of SLR in property value. Arbitrage opportunities with outside markets help to
    maintain high prices as high-income buyers enter the market, even when outside
    markets are constant.
  10: The model has a fixed supply of housing, assuming rebuilding after storms, which
    focuses the analysis on property value effects rather than episodic damage costs.
    The spatial resolution is at the nourishment unit level, which is smaller than
    a town but larger than a census block group.
  11: The risk premium term in the model acts to augment the discount rate used in
    property valuation, reflecting the impact of climate risks on investment decisions.
  13: The model includes both oceanfront and non-oceanfront homes, accounting for
    different tax ratios. Institutional investors are taxed but do not vote. Dune
    building is captured implicitly in nourishment decisions.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Coastal property values and their evolution over time are a key outcome of interest.
  3: Evolution of coastal real estate markets, incomes of residents, and shoreline
    management decisions.
  4: Property values (oceanfront and non-oceanfront), beach width, investor share
    of housing, expected rate of return on coastal real estate, marginal income tax
    rate of property owners, and risk premium for coastal real estate.
  5: Property values (oceanfront and non-oceanfront), income tax rate, investor market
    share in housing.
  10: Property values are affected by storm risk.
  11: Property values are affected by sea-level rise (SLR) and storms.
  13: Property values, property tax revenue.
Quantitative Material:
  5: Percent difference in property value (oceanfront and non-oceanfront shown in
    graph), difference in beach width (meters, shown in graph), difference in income
    tax rate (shown in graph), difference in investor market share (shown in graph).
    Simulation runs 150 years.
Quantitative material:
  1: No quantitative estimates of macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes (GDP effects, productivity
    loss, interest, inflation, budget balance, etc.) or measures of economic costs/benefits
    of nation-wide adaptation are provided on this page.
  3: One meter of SLR over a 100-year period.
  4: Property value decline over time given SLR, beach width changes in meters, investor
    share percentages, expected return rate percentages, income tax rate percentages,
    risk premium rate percentages, time horizon of 150 years, barrier height relative
    to sea level (1m initially, decreasing to 0m by year 150), beach nourishment subsidy
    rate (90%).
  13: "Equations are provided for calculating the yearly cost of loan repayment for\
    \ nourishment (TCYi), the additional property tax rate (\u03C4p,add), and the\
    \ cost of a nourishment event (cost(t)). Beach width is used with property value\
    \ to measure impact of nourishment. A 50% threshold of resident-owner agents voting\
    \ to nourish is implemented."
