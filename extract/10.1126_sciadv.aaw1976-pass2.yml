  8: Extracted Information
Drivers of Risk:
  1: "El Ni\xF1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), tropical\
    \ Atlantic variability (TAV), and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)."
  2: "El Ni\xF1o, La Ni\xF1a, Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), sea surface temperature (SST)\
    \ anomalies, soil moisture anomalies, Rossby wave trains, tropical Atlantic variability\
    \ (TAV), increased precipitation (disease and cloudiness), decreased insolation."
  3: Climate modes (ENSO, IOD, NAO) and weather patterns affect crop yields, leading
    to production variability.
  4: Climate modes (ENSO, IOD, TAV, NAO).
  5: "ENSO (El Ni\xF1o-Southern Oscillation), IOD (Indian Ocean Dipole), TAV, and\
    \ NAO climate modes as drivers of crop yield variability; Specifically, El Ni\xF1\
    o events can force globally synchronous maize failures, as it did in 1983."
  8: "Climate variability modes such as ENSO (El Ni\xF1o-Southern Oscillation), NAO\
    \ (North Atlantic Oscillation), TAV, and IOD (Indian Ocean Dipole) are considered\
    \ as drivers of risk for crop production."
Highlights:
  1: ENSO was responsible for the largest synchronous crop failure in the modern historical
    record (in 1983).
  2: "El Ni\xF1o climate teleconnections affect crop yields globally. Developing El\
    \ Ni\xF1os stabilize the tropical troposphere, reducing precipitation over Ethiopia\
    \ and causing crop failures. Mature El Ni\xF1os lead to increased probability\
    \ of disease and increased cloudiness that decreases insolation lowering yields\
    \ for wheat in southeast South America."
  3: "Climate modes contribute roughly equally (\u223C 15 to 20%) to the overall climate-related\
    \ crop yield variance."
  4: Maize production is more strongly affected by climate modes than wheat or soybeans,
    with climate modes accounting for a larger percentage of its global production
    variability.
  5: ENSO has a substantial influence on global maize production and has the potential
    to force globally synchronous maize failures. Climate modes substantially affect
    crop yield variability on both regional and global scales.
Methodology:
  1: Maximum covariance analysis (MCA) of the coupled modes of variability between
    climate and crop yields.
  2: Multilinear regression analysis using standardized ENSO time expansion coefficients.
  3: Partial regression coefficients were used to analyze the relationship between
    climate indices (IOD, TAV, NAO) and climate variables.
  4: Variance analysis of harvested area of wheat, maize, and soybean in specific
    regions to determine the percent of national or subnational scale variance explained
    by climate modes (ENSO, IOD, TAV, NAO).
  5: MCA (Maximum Covariance Analysis) is used to derive ENSO-forced yield anomalies.
    Variance analysis is performed at national or subnational scale (local) and globally
    aggregated time series (global). The analysis considers the influence of climate
    modes (ENSO, IOD, TAV, NAO) on crop yield variability.
  8: The paper uses multiple methods including Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA),
    linear multiple regression analyses, event composites, and correlations to identify
    and confirm the relationship between climate variability modes and crop yield
    anomalies. It also calculates local and global production variance.
More Notes:
  1: The paper provides a basis for monitoring and potentially predicting simultaneous
    crop failures. The analysis focuses on the relationship between climate modes
    and crop yields in specific regions, like Northeast Brazil, southwest Mexico,
    and West Africa.
  3: The analysis considers the impact of climate modes on crop production in different
    regions, highlighting variations based on production intensity (quartiles of production
    intensity)
  4: Heavy irrigation of wheat in China and India explains the muted effect of climate
    modes on wheat production. The degree to which climate mode forces offsetting
    crop yield anomalies depends on how the spatial distribution and intensity of
    climate teleconnections intersect the distribution and intensity of crop production.
  5: The interconnected global food system makes understanding the drivers of global-scale
    disruptions to food production necessary. The study indicates that climate modes
    can produce global-scale production anomalies, and further research is needed
    on how these events translate to price shocks or export restrictions.
  8: The study focuses on the impact of climate variability on crop yields and production
    anomalies.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Crop production variability, specifically maize, soybean, and wheat
  2: Crop production variability, specifically wheat, maize, and soybeans yields.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Variance in crop production (wheat, maize, soybean) at national or subnational
    scale.
  5: Global synchronous crop failures in maize; potential effects on food prices and
    export restrictions.
Quantitative material:
  1: ENSO, IOD, TAV, and NAO account for 18, 7, and 6% of globally aggregated maize,
    soybean, and wheat production variability, respectively.
  2: IOD and ENSO contribute to 30 to 41% of wheat production variability. Climate
    variability explains 10 to 23% of crop production variability in southeast South
    America and the United States.
  3: Climate modes account for 23%, 17%, and 15% of local maize, wheat, and soybean
    production variability respectively.
  4: Climate modes account for 18% of the variability of global maize production,
    but only 7 and 6% of the variability of global soybean and wheat production respectively.
  5: Analysis of variance explained by climate modes at global and national scales
    for maize, soybean, and wheat. Percentage of local variance explained disaggregated
    by average absolute production quartile for maize, soybean, and wheat. Quantitative
    values are illustrated in the figures (bar charts) described.
  8: The paper calculates local and global production variance, which are measures
    of the variability in crop production at different spatial scales. Specific quantitative
    results are not found on this page.
