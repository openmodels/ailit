Drivers of Risk:
  1: Projected climate-change scenarios in 2040 and 2070 impacting land use in Chile.
  2: Projected climate change scenarios in 2040 and 2070; reduced precipitation; shrinking
    glaciers; salinization and desertification of agricultural lands.
  3: Anticipated climate change impacts on total land use and the ability of decision-makers
    to adapt to changing climate conditions.
  4: Climate change impacts, including projected changes in climate conditions and
    water availability, affect agricultural productivity and land use.
  6: "Changes in net incomes (\u03C0ic) of different agricultural activities due to\
    \ shifts in crop and input prices (pic, wic) and yields (yic)."
  7: Climate change impacting crop yields and land suitability for different agricultural
    activities.
  8: Climate change scenarios A240, A270 (severe) and B240, B270 (moderate).
  9: Climate change scenarios (A240, A270, B240, B270) impacting agricultural productivity,
    water stress, and land allocation.
  10: Climate change leading to altered rainfall patterns and arid zone shifts, specifically
    referring to climate change scenarios A240, B240, A270, and B270.
  11: Climate change impacts on agricultural land suitability for wheat and table
    grapes, increasing water scarcity, particularly in northern geographic zones.
  12: Climate change is the primary driver, impacting avocado yields at the municipal
    level.
  13: Climate change impacts on water availability, temperature, and agroclimatic
    zones; shifts in agroclimatic zones due to Chile's north-south orientation; changes
    in growing conditions.
  14: Severe climate-change scenario; Moderate climate-change scenario; Temperature
    changes; Precipitation changes; Reductions in irrigation; North-south shift in
    agroclimatic zones
  15: Climate change impacting crop production; Changes in international markets;
    Changes in international prices; Changes in technologies; Changes in trade agreements;
    Natural and political shocks
Highlights:
  1: The impacts of climate changes will be mitigated by land-use adaptation, the
    main export-earning crops tending to move south.
  2: The paper analyzes the expected impacts of climate change on agricultural land
    and labor use in Chile in 2040 and 2070, focusing on farmer's land allocation
    decisions in response to climate change and profit incentives. The study highlights
    the importance of the agriculture and food processing sectors to Chile's employment
    and export earnings, and the potential welfare implications of climate change
    induced salinization and desertification.
  3: Impact of anticipated climate change on total land use in Chile is relatively
    small due to adaptability of decision-makers adjusting their activities.
  6: The main focus is on how climate change impacts the allocation of agricultural
    land across different activities by affecting their relative net incomes.
  7: Annual crops and fruit plantations decline in land area in the nearer term (2040),
    while pastures and forage and forest plantations increase. By 2070, there is a
    recuperation in land planted with field crops and fruits, although the areas planted
    remain lower than at the baseline. The surface of pastures and forage by 2070
    falls below the baseline. The forestry sector will become increasingly important.
  8: Severe climate change scenarios significantly reduce net income in forestry and
    agriculture, particularly impacting fruit production.  Moderate climate change
    scenarios can lead to a slight increase in income.
  9: Total net income decreases under climate change scenarios A240 and A270, but
    increases under B240 and B270, compared to the baseline. Total agricultural labor
    demand decreases in all climate change scenarios, with the most notable decline
    (18%) in the severe scenario for 2070 (A270).
  10: The surface area dedicated to wheat declines in total for all climate change
    scenarios, with the most severe scenario (A270) showing significant decreases.
    Northern regions experience proportionally larger decreases in wheat land due
    to southward arid zone shifts. The southernmost region (Los Lagos) shows an increase
    in wheat land, indicating a southward shift in climate suitability.
  11: Climate change is expected to significantly impact the land area suitable for
    wheat and table grapes, leading to a geographic shift in agricultural activity.  Table
    grape production is projected to decline, with a shift southward to areas with
    relatively better agroclimatic conditions.
  12: Under severe climate-change scenarios in 2070, the national area planted with
    avocados increases compared to the baseline.
  13: Adaptation and land-use substitution can offset or mitigate the negative impacts
    of climate change on farmer and worker welfare. The impact of climate change on
    total land use in Chile is relatively small due to adaptation and the shift in
    agroclimatic zones along its north-south axis. Water availability is a key determinant
    of yield changes and land allocation profitability. Plantation forestry increases,
    but is less intensive in labor use.
  14: Aggregate impacts of anticipated climate change on Chilean agriculture activities
    will likely be relatively small; Farmer adaptability and the mitigation effects
    of land-use responses are important for overall welfare in the rural sector; There
    are significant changes at the regional, subnational level
  15: Climate change will likely bring some losses to various communities linked to
    agriculture in Chile, but it cannot be ruled out that it may also lead to opportunities;
    Climate change will induce changes in agricultural production in other regions
    of the world; Taking advantage of new opportunities will require investments appropriate
    to local climates; Policymakers would have to consider means to mitigate anticipated
    and unanticipated adverse effects of climate change
Methodology:
  1: A farmland allocation model with associated labor employment at the municipal
    level driven by expected relative net incomes per hectare, constructed from local
    average per-hectare yields, regional average output prices and per-hectare production
    cost estimates. Sensitivities of cropland allocation to relative net-income changes
    were estimated using historical land allocations at the municipal level derived
    from the last two Chilean Agricultural Censuses.
  2: "Model of agricultural land allocations and labor use in Chile under alternative\
    \ climate-change scenarios, based on farmer decisions regarding land allocation\
    \ among 25 different activities (field crops, fruits, pasture-based activities,\
    \ and forestry plantation) for 2040 and 2070 under two climate regimes; uses locally\
    \ scaled simulations based on the Hadley Center\u2019s Precis model; assumes farmers\
    \ make long-run decisions prior to the realization of a particular climate scenario;\
    \ uses the ceteris paribus assumption."
  3: Analysis based on changes in relative net incomes per hectare of land-use activities
    at the municipal level; simulations using long-term scenarios of greenhouse gas
    emissions, temperature, and precipitation outcomes.
  4: Econometric approach employing hedonic land-price models alongside agronomic
    simulation models to estimate agricultural productivity under different climate
    scenarios (A2 and B2) for 2040 and 2070.
  6: 'A multinomial logit model is used to simulate the relative shares of different
    agricultural activities based on their net incomes. The model is calibrated using
    data from 2007 and yield estimates for 2020 to model future climate scenarios.
    The analysis is performed in two steps: first, allocating land among broad activities
    (annual crops, fruit plantation, forestry, and pastures); second, allocating land
    among specific species within each group.'
  7: The analysis projects land use allocations under four climate change scenarios
    (B240, B270, A240, A270) derived from the Hadley Centre Coupled Model, projecting
    land use changes based on expected profitabilities of activities for 2040 and
    2070, using the 2020 climate state as the initial base of comparison.
  8: Analysis based on different climate change scenarios and their impact on land
    use by activity and crop. Scenarios are projected to 2040 and 2070.
  9: Simulation based on real price and cost data and the agricultural census year
    of 2007, translated into 2007 USD. Agricultural labor demand is translated into
    year-employment equivalents (full-time workers, 44 h week).
  10: The analysis uses climate change scenarios to project changes in land suitability
    for rainfed wheat in different regions of Chile. It compares land use under baseline
    conditions (census year 2007) and projected land use in 2070 under the most severe
    climate-change scenario (A270), using pre-2015 regional definitions.
  11: The paper uses municipality-level results to illustrate geographic shifts in
    land planted with table grapes under severe climate-change scenarios compared
    to baseline.  The analysis considers the impact of climate change on specific
    crops (wheat and table grapes) and their geographic distribution. Results applicable
    for 2070.
  12: The analysis considers the direct influence of climate change on avocado yields
    and the mitigation/substitution actions of farmers responding to changes in the
    relative profitability of crops.
  13: The study uses scenarios to project changes in land use and agricultural production
    in Chile under different climate change conditions until 2070; modeling of decision-maker
    adaptation to changing climate conditions, including adjustments in activity portfolios
    within localities, and land-use substitution.
  14: Simulation results considering farmer adaptability and land-use responses; Ricardian
    model of self-reported land values (used in a cited study); Optimization algorithm
    for land allocations (used in a cited study)
  15: Land-use projection model; Simulation adopting assumption that farmer decisions
    are long term in nature, made prior to the realization of a particular climate
    scenario and based on a known, prior climate state
More Notes:
  1: The paper focuses on Chile and uses climate change scenarios for 2040 and 2070.
    It models the agricultural sector's response in terms of land use and labor allocation.
  2: The study aims to contribute to the methodological toolset for analyses in cases
    where simulations from optimization-based programming models require considerably
    more production-level data than are currently available in less-developed countries.
  4: Municipality-level yield indices used to adjust regional crop yield estimates;
    incorporates standardized crop budgets for yield and cost estimates.
  6: The paper focuses on land allocation in a specific community (c) and uses Chilean
    data from 2007 as a baseline.
  7: The analysis assumes that land allocations are based on expected profitability
    prior to the realization of the future climate state and considers factors like
    farmer investments and asset fixity that create inertia in land-use changes.
  8: There is a relative shift toward crops and forestry as a way to mitigate the
    negative impacts on other crops.
  9: Field crop labor demand remains stable or increases slightly, while fruit labor
    demand decreases due to farm reallocations and climate-related productivity declines.
    Forestry labor demand increases due to land shifting from other crops, particularly
    pastures.
  10: The paper focuses on the geographic diversity of climate change impacts on specific
    crops in Chile. While it mentions that table grapes are important enough to be
    included as a line item in national accounts, it doesn't explicitly link changes
    in wheat production to specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes. The study excluded
    three regions in the extreme arid north and two in the extreme south. The study
    compares the climates in Chile to those on the west coast of North America, arguing
    that they are similar.
  11: The paper suggests a mitigation and substitution effect where landowners shift
    to alternative crops less affected by water scarcity.  The analysis distinguishes
    between different climate change scenarios (A240/B240, A270, B270) in assessing
    impacts on table grapes. The maps (Figure 1 and Figure 2 - only Figure 1 described
    in instructions) are used to visually represent geographic shifts in wheat (Figure
    1) and table grape (Figure 2) cultivation areas.
  12: The observed hectares planted with avocados expand both northward and southward
    from the central zone of the country.
  13: The study focuses on Chile and its specific geographic characteristics (north-south
    orientation) and agricultural production patterns. The study considers both moderate
    and severe climate change scenarios. The findings are location-specific, with
    northern and southern regions experiencing different impacts. The maps show hectares
    under avocado at baseline and in severe change scenarios in 2070.
  14: Climate changes are projected to shift agroclimatic zones in a way that moves
    southward the climate conditions beneficial for activities currently more concentrated
    in the north; The simulation results cannot reflect the full range of possible
    changes at the level of communities and individual farmer households.
  15: "The model is limited by the ceteris paribus nature of the analysis; Future\
    \ work should address a more dynamic process of climate adaptation; Cost data\
    \ from farm surveys should be preferred to activity budgets; Climate projections\
    \ on which relative net incomes are based may not be accurate; Future work should\
    \ incorporate a political\u2013economic model of possible land policy changes"

Quantitative material:
  1: The analysis is performed at the municipal level driven by expected relative
    net incomes per hectare.
  2: "Primary production of the agriculture and forestry sectors accounts for approximately\
    \ 3% of Chile\u2019s GDP; agriculture employs approximately 12% of the total national\
    \ workforce; primary and processed agricultural and forestry products represent\
    \ about 15% to 20% of Chile\u2019s annual merchandise export earnings."
  6: The equations provided (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) are quantitative and model how land
    is allocated across activities based on net income. Initial income calculations
    are in CLP (Chilean Pesos) for the year 2007 converted into USD at the 2007 exchange
    rate.
  7: Land devoted to annual crops declines by 7 percent relative to the baseline under
    the 2040 climate scenarios. In the 2070 climate scenarios, the land of annual
    crops declines relative to the baseline by less than one percent in the severe
    scenario but increases slightly by over 4 percent in the moderate. Fruit plantations
    also decline by 7 percent in the 2040 scenarios but increase by 6 percent in 2070
    under the severe scenario and by 14 percent under the moderate. Forestry land
    is expected to increase by approximately 2 to 3 percent under all the climate-change
    scenarios.
  8: Severe climate-change scenarios (A240 and A270) lead to a 5% decrease in net
    revenues in 2040 and a 14% loss by 2070 relative to the baseline in the forestry
    and agriculture sectors. Moderate scenarios (B240 and B270) lead to a slight increase
    in income over the baseline.  Net revenues from fruit are expected to decline
    by 76 percent in the longer term under the severe-change scenario (A270), and
    by 31 percent under the moderate-change scenario.

    \ (A240/B240). to 128,219 (A270)"
  11: Land area under table grapes by region and climate-change scenario (hectares)
    is provided in Table 5 for Baseline, A240/B240, A270, and B270 scenarios. Land
    area decline for table grapes is projected to be 21-47% depending on climate-change
    scenario.
  12: Table 6 provides area planted with avocados by region and climate-change scenario
    (hectares) for the baseline, A240/B240, A270, and B270 scenarios.
  13: Avocado plantings may expand to 56,000 hectares under severe climate change
    scenarios; field crop land declines slightly in the most severe change scenario,
    but increases by over 4% in the moderate scenario; land devoted to fruit decreases
    slightly under the most severe scenario but increases by slightly over 5% under
    the moderate-change scenario.
  14: "Severe climate-change scenario would lead to slight declines in total agricultural\
    \ net-income; Moderate climate-change scenario would increase total agricultural\
    \ net-income; 2.7 percent reduction in net income at the national level under\
    \ the severe A2 climate scenario for 2040 (from another study); a 2.5\u25E6C increase\
    \ in mean temperature and a 10 percent decrease in precipitation would increase\
    \ land values by 40 percent for medium and large farmers (from another study)"
