Drivers of Risk:
  1: Aging dynamics and increasing natural disasters
  2: Aging populations, natural disasters
  3: Climate change (extreme weather events, flooding, hurricanes), earthquakes
  9: Demographic changes such as aging populations, changes in savings and tax rates,
    the growth rate of knowledge, and the old-age dependency ratio impact economic
    growth outcomes.
  10: Climate risks (natural disaster occurrences, extreme weather events), aging
    population (affects savings rate, growth rate)
  11: The number of days relating to all kinds of natural disasters are accumulated
    as a proxy for the potential impact of natural disasters.
  13: Real long-term interest rate, Old-age dependency ratio, Per capita income, Days
    for natural disasters
  15: Old-age dependency ratio changes and natural disaster frequency are identified
    as drivers impacting savings rates.
  16: Twin long-term challenge (likely referring to climate change and aging population)

Highlights:
  1: 'OECD countries face a twin long-run challenge: The impact of aging dynamics
    and increasing natural disasters on savings ratios'
  2: Aging populations and natural disasters have significant negative impacts on
    savings rates; the real long-term interest rate has a diminishing role regarding
    savings behaviour.
  3: "The savings rate falls if natural disasters are rising in terms of the number\
    \ of days duration. Successful climate policy \u2013 with lower frequencies of\
    \ natural disasters \u2013 will raise the global (OECD) savings ratio and thus\
    \ could affect the cost of capital and the cost of the global modernization necessary\
    \ to achieve sustainability and climate neutrality."
  9: Demographic changes are expected to flatten the growth path for output due to
    factors like decreasing population growth and increasing old-age dependency ratios.
  10: Climate risks, particularly natural disasters, can negatively impact the savings
    rate, potentially leading to a lower growth path. Increased climate disaster days
    and damages are likely to cause a higher depreciation rate of capital. Aging effects
    (decreases in savings rate, population growth and increases in aging effects)
    lead to a flattening of the growth path.
  11: The null hypothesis of common slopes is rejected, thus, the individual-specific
    effect should be considered. The fixed-effects model (FE) can be seen to have
    better goodness-of-fit to the data in comparison to a pooled ordinary least squares
    (OLS) estimator. The model with random effects (RE) is also examined by a Lagrange
    multiplier (LM) test, the null hypothesis of the LM test which assumes that variances
    across entities are zero can be rejected.
  13: Real long-term interest rate is negatively associated with the savings rate;
    Old-age dependency ratio is negatively associated with the savings rate; Per capita
    income displays a positive and highly significant impact on the savings rate;
    Natural disasters negatively influence the savings rate.
  14: Several coefficients are highly statistically significant (***), indicating
    strong relationships between the drivers and the outcome of interest. The EU variable,
    disaster variable, and others all show significant impacts.
  15: Significant negative relationship between old-age dependency ratio and savings
    rate; reversal to a positive relationship post-2007. Negative link between number
    of disaster days and savings rate.
  16: Successful climate policy will raise the global (OECD) savings ratio and thus
    could affect the cost of capital and the cost of global modernization necessary
    for achieving sustainability and climate neutrality.
  17: Some countries are included in certain models but not others, suggesting variability
    in data or applicability.
Methodology:
  1: The paper analyzes the impact of aging and natural disasters on savings ratios
    in OECD countries.
  2: Enhanced growth model, panel approach
  9: The analysis is based on an extension of the Solow model, examining the relationship
    between variables like savings rates, growth rates, and dependency ratios.
  10: Panel data analysis with fixed effects is used to estimate an enhanced growth
    equation based on a theoretical framework. The model is applicable to 34 OECD
    countries from 1980 to 2020.
  11: "Macro-panels of 34 OECD countries over the period 1980\u20132020 are used.\
    \ CIPS panel unit root test, residual-based DF test, Chow test, fixed-effects\
    \ model (FE), Lagrange multiplier (LM) test, Hausman\u2019s specification test\
    \ are performed."
  13: Regression analysis using Driscoll-Kraay standard errors to account for cross-sectional
    dependence, groupwise heteroscedasticity, and autocorrelation; Full samples and
    sub-samples with different time periods (2007-2020) and country groups are used.
  15: Empirical analysis based on OECD countries from 1980 to 2020, with a specific
    mention of results for 2007-2020.
  17: The page lists countries included in regression models M1 to M10, indicating
    varying samples for each model.
More Notes:
  2: The study explores for the first time the impact of natural disasters on OECD
    countries.
  3: People witness to the physical destruction brought about by natural disasters
    feel discouraged with respect to the accumulation of physical assets or because
    the negative income shocks associated with natural disaster shocks undermine the
    ability of people to maintain high savings ratios in OECD countries and other
    country groups.
  9: The paper argues the interdependencies between savings rates, per-capita income,
    and the old-age dependency ratio.
  10: The empirical model uses the savings rate as the dependent variable and includes
    the long-term interest rate, disaster days, and the natural log of GDP as explanatory
    variables.
  11: No relevant information
  13: The analysis focuses on OECD countries over the period since 1980; The countries
    included in the samples are listed in Table 4 in the Appendix.
  16: Government aid behavior may reduce households' willingness to insure against
    natural disasters, potentially impacting savings rates.
  17: The page serves as an appendix listing countries involved in different regression
    models; specific quantitative or qualitative outcomes are not detailed.
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Savings ratios
  2: Savings rate
  3: Savings ratio (OECD)
  9: Per-capita income and savings rate are interrelated; higher per-capita income
    leads to a higher savings rate.
  10: Savings rate; growth path level; depreciation rate of capital
  11: No relevant information
  13: Savings rate
  15: The analysis explores savings behavior as a macroeconomic outcome in OECD countries,
    impacted by climate change and an aging society.

Quantitative material:
  1: Vol. 19, Iss. 4, pp. 741-759
  2: Uses data from OECD countries between 1980 and 2020
  10: Uses panel data analysis with fixed effects on 34 OECD countries from 1980-2020
    to estimate the enhanced growth equation, using the savings rate, long-term interest
    rate, and GDP per capita as variables.
  11: Data on this are collected from the EM-DAT, CRED/ UCLouvain.
  13: A 1% change of the real long-term interest rate is expected to lead to a decrease
    in the range of 0.2 and 0.3% in the savings rate (P < 0.01) for the analysed OECD
    countries; a one-percent increase of the old-age dependency ratio is associated
    with a 0.36% decrease of the savings rate; for each additional day increase in
    disasters, the savings rate is expected to reduce by 0.02 (p < 0.05) and 0.01
    (p < 0.05) percent
  14: Yes, there are numerous quantitative results presented in the table, including
    coefficients, standard errors (in parentheses), and significance levels (denoted
    by asterisks). These coefficients appear to represent the impact of the drivers
    on the outcome of interest.
