Drivers of Risk:
  193: No relevant information
  230: Global warming, intense human mobility, trading of agricultural goods, pest
    invasions (specifically fruit flies).
  243: Establishment of invasive fruit fly species (Tephritid species).
  244: "Invasive fruit \uFB02ies"
  245: "Climate change; Expansion of the geographic range of insect pests; Shift of\
    \ species\u2019 geographic ranges towards the poles; An increasing number of arrivals\
    \ of new pests to a region; Dramatic increases of some insect pest populations."
  247: Climate warming relaxing barriers for establishment (winter survival, host
    fruit availability); increased human mobility and fresh fruit trading (increased
    propagule pressure); cultivation of tropical/subtropical fruit in cooler areas;
    adaptation of invasive species to cooler environments.
  252: Human mobility, fresh fruit and vegetables trading, climate change, and probably
    other factors.

Highlights:
  193: No relevant information
  230: Fruit fly invasions, enhanced by global warming and human activity, have profound
    effects on national and regional economies, ecosystems, and agricultural production.
  243: Invasive fruit flies can cause continuous devastation, potentially leading
    to crop abandonment and requiring costly management.
  244: Invasive fruit flies can have significant economic impacts due to direct losses
    on fruits and vegetables, management efforts, embargos, loss of markets, quarantine
    regulations, and subsequent job losses.
  245: Temperate habitats will become suitable for tropical fruit flies, therefore,
    the risk of invasion events by tropical fruit flies in these areas will increase
    dramatically.  The current geographic distribution of the univoltine Rhagoletis
    species that undergo obligatory pupae diapause are expected to shrink into higher
    altitudes and northern cooler areas.

Methodology:
  193: Discusses Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches for studying dispersal of organisms

    warming on invasion dynamics, detection and monitoring of invasion events, methods
    and strategies to confront invasive fruit flies.
  245: Modeling techniques are employed to predict the potential distribution of invasive
    species.  Bioclimatic studies predict expansion of fruit fly distribution as a
    result of climate warming.

More Notes:

  247: The paper discusses the range expansion of the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly)
    in Europe as an example of how climate change and other factors can facilitate
    the spread of invasive species, potentially leading to economic consequences.
  318: This paper focuses on the spatial analysis of sterile insect release programs,
    specifically for tephritid fruit flies. It describes methods for mapping changes
    in wild fly capture rates and identifying areas of low sterile fly recapture rates.
    There is no mention of macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks, or the costs and benefits
    of adaptation at a national level.

  509: This page focuses on fruit fly eradication programs and uses terms related
    to entomology. It does not contain macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risk information
    related to climate change or adaptation at a national level.
  510: The text describes fruit fly eradication programs. While potentially relevant
    to agriculture and food security, it does not directly address macroeconomic or
    macro-fiscal risks of climate change or adaptation costs/benefits at a national
    level. The focus is on specific eradication efforts in the Cook and Gin Islands.
  513: This excerpt focuses on pest management strategies and does not directly address
    macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes related to climate change adaptation at
    a national level.
  582: The density of detection traps was increased in response to ongoing increases
    in detections and their associated eradication costs.
  622: This page does not directly discuss macroeconomic or macro-fiscal risks of
    climate change or the costs and benefits of adaptation at a national level. Instead,
    it focuses on the challenges of species identification and the potential for errors
    in biological surveys. The example of the fruit fly incursion in Papua New Guinea
    serves as an analogy for the difficulties in accurately assessing and responding
    to complex problems, but it does not provide specific data or analysis related
    to the macroeconomic effects of climate change or adaptation strategies.
  628: This page provides a case study example of a biosecurity event involving B.
    papayae, and the costs of eradication, but it focuses on a specific event rather
    than providing a generalized macroeconomic or fiscal analysis of climate-related
    risks or adaptation costs and benefits at a national level.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  193: No relevant information
  230: Impact on national and regional economies, sustainable production of agricultural
    goods.
  243: Abandonment of cultivation of some sensitive crops, need for intensive management
    efforts to sustain fruit and vegetable production, threat to the fresh fruit industry.
  244: Potential impact of *A. ludens* establishment in the USA is estimated
  245: Economic impact on crops; Control efforts and population management projects
    may be more difficult and the likelihood of costly missteps increased.
  247: Economic burden on the trading of fresh fruits and vegetables due to direct
    fruit damage of medfly and similarly aggressive invasive species.
  252: Threatens global fruit and vegetable production; economic interests at the
    state or country level.

  628: Total expenditure for the 42 month campaign to eradicate B. papayae from Australia
    was AU$33.5 million. Threat of B. papayae invading countries has led to major
    quarantine initiatives and the imposition of market access restrictions. Thailand
    is heavily restricted in its export of fruit to markets in Taiwan, with commodities,
    such as rambutan, denied access, because B. papayae occurs in Thailand but not
    Taiwan.
