Drivers of Risk:
  1: Early-life weather and pollution exposures (specifically extreme precipitation,
    temperature, carbon monoxide, and ozone).
  3: Early-life pollution exposure (specifically CO and O3).
  8: The drivers of risk are extreme temperature and precipitation.
  13: Early-life pollution exposure, extreme weather, deviations from seasonal averages,
    interactions of weather with location-specific concentrations of pollution sources.
  17: Early-life CO and O3 exposure; Extreme precipitation and temperature
  18: Early-life pollution exposure (particularly O3)
  21: High Temperatures, Low Precipitation, CO (std), O3 (std).
  22: Early-life exposure to CO and O3 pollution.
  23: Pollution (specifically O3 precursor emissions).
Highlights:
  1: Early-life pollution exposures negatively affect test scores, schooling, hours
    worked, and earnings.
  3: Reducing early-life pollution exposure by 25% could lead to a 2% increase in
    GDP (based on 2005 GDP levels).
  13: Weather directly affects short-term anthropometric outcomes, but no direct effects
    of weather on long-term cognitive and labor market outcomes.
  17: Early-life O3 exposure negatively affects achieved years of schooling; Early-life
    O3 exposures corresponds to fewer hours worked per week and lower hourly wage;
    The effect on hours is concentrated among males, and the earnings effect is driven
    by females; The informal sector is driving both the hours effect and the earnings
    effect
  18: Early-life exposure to ozone (O3) is shown to negatively affect long-term cognitive
    and labor market outcomes.
  21: High temperatures and low precipitation increase the incidence of low birth
    weight. Birth length is negatively affected by both high and low temperatures,
    and low precipitation. The effects of low precipitation extend to age 2 height.
    Several statistically significant relationships are observed between cognitive
    and labor market outcomes and CO/O3 levels.
  22: Early-life O3 exposure reduces schooling attainment, hours worked, and earnings.
    A 25% reduction in early-life O3 exposure leads to a 2.8% increase in earnings
    and a 0.45 increase in hours worked per week.
  23: The long-term benefits of environmental regulations (specifically reducing O3
    precursor emissions) may outweigh the costs and fuel economic growth in developing
    nations.
Methodology:
  1: Combines a three-decade longitudinal survey measuring human capital development,
    a database of historical weather, and multiple databases characterizing carbon
    monoxide and ozone in the Philippines during the 1980s. Analysis relates weather
    and pollution to short- and long-term human capital outcomes.
  3: Study uses data on weather, air pollutants, and early-life origins of human capital;
    identification strategies and specifications are described in Section 3; Results
    are described in Section 4 and discussed in Section 5.
  8: The analysis appears to be statistical, examining the relationship between weather-related
    variables (extreme temperature, precipitation) and socio-economic outcomes using
    regression or similar techniques. The period of focus appears to include the year
    2005.
  13: "Instrumental variables (weather instruments) are used to address omitted variable\
    \ and measurement error biases. LIML and MBTSLS estimators are used. Sargan tests\
    \ are used to test the differences between LIML and MBTSLS estimates. Robust standard\
    \ errors are employed in OLS regressions, Bekker standard errors are employed\
    \ in LIML regressions, and Koles\xE1r et al. (2015) standard errors are employed\
    \ in MBTSLS regressions."
  17: LIML and MBTSLS estimators
  18: The analysis uses the CLHNS data to assess the impact of early-life environmental
    exposures on human capital, addressing attrition bias and correcting for multiple
    hypothesis testing.
  21: OLS estimates for short-term anthropometric outcomes, LIML estimates for long-term
    cognitive and labor market outcomes; Multiple hypothesis test adjustments (Benjamini-Hochberg
    and Simes).
  22: "The analysis generalizes outside the sample and assumes external validity to\
    \ scale O3\u2019s effects on hours and earnings."
  23: The discounted present value of reducing O3 exposures is calculated based on
    assumptions about lifetime earnings, discount rates, and the impact of O3 on earnings.
More Notes:
  1: The paper suggests that environmental regulations could be investments that fuel
    economic growth, rather than just taxes.
  3: The paper investigates the link between early-life pollution exposure and long-term
    human capital and labor market outcomes.
  8: The paper focuses on individual-level impacts of weather events, particularly
    on health, labor, and migration decisions. The units of currency appear to be
    Philippine pesos (PhP).
  13: Exposure measures have been standardized for interpretation.
  17: Extreme weather does not directly affect long-term labor market outcomes
  18: The paper focuses on human capital as a mechanism through which early-life environmental
    exposures can have long-term economic consequences, potentially impacting productivity
    and labor market outcomes.
  21: The study was performed in Metro Cebu, Philippines, and the results are specific
    to this context. The study notes a lack of direct effects of weather on long-term
    cognitive and labor market outcomes and align with recent research on relationships.
  22: The analysis focuses on the long-term effects of early-life pollution exposure,
    contrasting with previous research primarily from developed economies. Results
    on hours are driven by males in the informal sector, and effects on earnings are
    driven by females in the informal sector.
  23: The analysis focuses on the human capital effects of early-life environment,
    with implications for long-term labor market outcomes and economic growth.

Outcome(s) of Interest:
  1: Discounted lifetime earnings.
  3: Cumulative discounted lifetime earnings would increase by $1,367 per person,

    outcomes, including morbidity (reported diarrheal and respiratory infections),
    labor outcomes (hours worked, individual income), and medical expenditures.
  13: Short-term anthropometric outcomes (low birth weight, birth length, age 2 height),
    long-term cognitive outcomes (standardized scores on non-verbal, math and language
    tests), and long-term labor market outcomes (hours worked per week, log of hourly
    earnings).

    Test Score, Std. Language Test Score, Achieved Years of Schooling); Long-term
    Labor Market Outcomes (Weekly Hours Worked, Log of Hourly Earnings).
  22: Increase in earnings and increase in hours worked due to reduction in early-life
    exposure to O3 precursor emissions.
  23: Annual national impact of reducing O3 precursor emissions by 25% is estimated
    at $2.05 billion (2005 USD).
Quantitative material:
  1: A 25 per cent reduction in early-life ozone exposure would increase per person
    discounted lifetime earnings by $1,367, which would scale to $2.05 billion at
    the national level (or 2 per cent of 2005 GDP).
  3: $1,367 per person, $44.5 million in the province, and $2.05 billion at the national
    level (or 2 per cent of 2005 GDP) increase in cumulative discounted lifetime earnings
    if early-life pollution exposure was reduced by 25 per cent.

    for variables such as 'income', 'expenditures', 'hours worked', and rates of migration.
  13: Tables 2-4 show the main results, the effects of the early-life environment
    on short-term anthropometric, and long-term cognitive and labor market outcomes.
  17: A 1 standard deviation increase in early-life CO emissions exposure corresponds
    to a 0.027 standard deviation decrease in non-verbal test scores, and a 0.042
    standard deviation in language test scores; Early-life O3 exposure reduces non-verbal
    test scores by 0.05 standard deviations, math test scores by 0.041 standard deviations,
    and language test scores by 0.07 standard deviations; A 1 standard deviation increase
    in early-life O3 exposure corresponds to 0.5 fewer years of schooling; Early-life
    O3 exposures decrease the number of hours worked per week by approximately 1.34
    and hourly earnings by 8.2 per cent; A 1 standard deviation increase in early-life
    O3 exposure reduces female earnings by 12.3 per cent; A 1 standard deviation increase
    in early-life O3 exposure in the informal sector reduces hours by 1.39 and earnings
    by 8.9 per cent

    but specific quantitative effects on macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes are not
    provided on this page.
  21: P-values and adjusted P-values for the impact of temperature, precipitation,
    CO, and O3 on the specified outcomes are presented in Table 7.
  22: A mandated 25 per cent reduction to emissions (specifically O3 precursor emissions)
    leads to an increase in earnings by 2.8 per cent and an increase in hours worked
    by 0.45 per week.
  23: $2.05 billion benefit from 25% reduction in O3 precursor emissions; $50 million
    annual cost of the Philippine Clean Air Act of 1999; $90 billion Philippine GDP
    in 2005.
