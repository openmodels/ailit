Drivers of Risk:
  1: CO2 and CH4 emissions from thawing permafrost due to climate warming in the Arctic
    are identified as drivers of risk.
  2: Permafrost emissions of CO2 and CH4; changes in global mean temperature; socio-economic
    scenarios (SSP2 and SSP3).
  3: Thawing permafrost emissions of CO2 and CH4.
  4: Permafrost CO2 and CH4 emissions; Thawing permafrost.
Highlights:
  1: "Permafrost emissions are projected to increase the mean NPV of climate change\
    \ impacts by 13%, and contribute an additional 0.17\u02DAC to global mean temperatures\
    \ by 2100."
  2: Permafrost emissions will cause significant economic damages. These damages are
    large enough to justify urgent action to minimize the scale of the release. An
    aggressive abatement strategy is needed.
  3: Permafrost emissions significantly impact global mean temperature rise.
  4: Permafrost emissions could have a significant extra economic impact, potentially
    reaching tens of trillions of US dollars per year by 2200. The NPV of the extra
    impacts is strongly influenced by specific inputs in the PAGE9 model, including
    TCR, PTP, EMUC, Emissions Uncertainty, FRT, and POW_2.
Methodology:
  1: The analysis links the PAGE09 integrated assessment model with the SiBCASA biophysical
    land surface parameterization model, running 100,000 simulations to assess economic
    impacts.
  2: Uses the PAGE09 model to estimate extra economic impacts from permafrost emissions;
    sensitivity analysis performed by varying model inputs like TCR, PTP rate, EMUC,
    permafrost emissions, FRT, and POW_2; scenarios are used involving different socio-economic
    pathways and emissions pathways. Results are applicable to global GDP at the end
    of the 21st and 22nd centuries
  3: PAGE9 simulations used to project temperature rise based on IPCC AR4 A1B scenario.
  4: The analysis uses the default PAGE9 method for the IPCC AR4 A1B scenario. The
    second graph illustrates the sensitivity of the NPV to different input parameters
    within the PAGE9 model.
More Notes:
  1: The study assumes no anthropogenic emissions after 2100 and excludes additional
    economic losses like infrastructure damage.
  2: 'Uncertainty is wide due to nonlinear model interactions between physical processes
    and economic impacts; Six key inputs drive the results: the TCR, the pure time
    preference (PTP) rate, the elasticity of marginal utility of consumption (EMUC),
    the permafrost emissions, the feedback response time (FRT) and the exponent of
    the non-economic impact function with temperature (POW_2).'
  3: Analysis is based on the IPCC AR4 A1B scenario.
  4: The analysis focuses on the economic impacts of permafrost thaw under a specific
    climate scenario (IPCC AR4 A1B) and model (PAGE9).
Outcome(s) of Interest:
  2: Extra economic impacts from permafrost emissions, measured in US$ trillion and
    as a percentage of global GDP; Net Present Value (NPV) of extra economic impacts.
  3: No relevant information
  4: Extra annual economic impacts from permafrost CO2 and CH4 emissions, measured
    in US$ trillion per year; Net Present Value (NPV) of extra impacts from thawing
    permafrost.
Outcomes of Interest:
  1: The study estimates an increase in the net present value (NPV) of climate change
    impacts by US$43 trillion due to permafrost emissions, indicating significant
    economic costs.
Quantitative material:
  1: "The paper provides quantitative measures such as the increase in NPV of climate\
    \ change impacts by US$43 trillion, and an additional global mean temperature\
    \ rise of 0.17\u02DAC by 2100 due to permafrost emissions."
  2: "The default PAGE09 model mean annual value of all the extra impacts is about\
    \ US $2.8 trillion in 2100 (about 0.35% of the projected global GDP in that year)\
    \ and peaks at about US $30 trillion in 2200 (about 0.7% of the projected GDP\
    \ in that year); Mean temperature increase by 0.26\xB0C in 2150 and 0.29\xB0C\
    \ in 2200 due to lags in the global response to emissions; By 2200 permafrost\
    \ emissions represent about 10% of cumulative anthropogenic emissions since pre-industrial\
    \ times and contribute about 7% of the total mean warming; changing the socio-economic\
    \ scenarios to SSP2 and SSP3 increases the mean NPV of extra economic impacts\
    \ to US$54 trillion and US$91 trillion, respectively; Using the UK Met Office\
    \ 2015r5low scenario, the mean NPV of the extra impacts falls to US$6 trillion,\
    \ with a 5-95% range of US$ 0.4-17 trillion; an aggressive abatement strategy\
    \ will reduce the mean extra impact of emissions by about US$37 trillion."
  3: Estimated annual emissions of CO2 from thawing permafrost for the A1B scenario
    from the IPCC AR4, with mean values and 5% and 95% confidence intervals. Global
    mean temperature rise relative to pre-industrial conditions by date, with and
    without permafrost and CO2 and CH4 emissions for the IPCC AR4 A1B scenario, showing
    ensemble mean and 5% and 95% confidence intervals. Projected CO2 emissions over
    time, with a central trend and upper/lower bounds.
  4: The graph of extra annual economic impacts from permafrost emissions shows a
    solid line (mean value) reaching approximately 40 US$ trillion per year and a
    dashed line (5 and 95% values) reaching nearly 100 US$ trillion per year by 2200.
    The input sensitivities are shown in a separate graph with values up to $100 trillion
    related to different input variables.
