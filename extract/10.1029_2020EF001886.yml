Drivers of Risk:
  5: Extreme heat events, population exposure to heat, characteristics of heat stress
    (severity as measured by 40-year return values of heat stress, and decadal trends
    in warm tail spread).
  6: Extreme heat stress (HS)
  8: Increases in temperature and absolute humidity leading to more severe heat stress
    (HS). RCP8.5 emission scenario.
  12: Increase in the risk of Population Impact (PI) from both short and long duration
    extreme Heat Stress (HS). Population growth alone can more than double the risk
    of PI in certain regions. Global-mean warming will dominate increases in PI risk
    in some areas.
Highlights:
  5: The most severe extreme heat events cause a disproportionate fraction of the
    societal impacts, motivating a special focus on them. Population exposure and
    heat stress characteristics, including 40-year return values and trends in warm
    tail spread, are key indicators.
  6: Focuses on quantifying changes in perceived impact (PI) of extreme heat stress
    (HS) using a composite indicator and risk ratio.
  8: "Extreme heat stress severity is projected to increase significantly across the\
    \ CONUS, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Atlantic coastal regions,\
    \ Midwest, and Great Plains, under the RCP8.5 emission scenario, with HS values\
    \ exceeding 40.6\xB0C."
  12: The risk of PI from extreme heat is substantially increasing in several parts
    of the CONUS, driven by both global warming and population growth.
Methodology:
  5: Indicator-based assessment technique to determine a composite indicator for PI
    of HS, building on the IPCC's framework of impacts, adaptations, and vulnerability
    assessment. Non-stationary frequency analysis is used to calculate 40-year return
    values of annual extreme summer HS events, selecting the best-fit GEV models based
    on the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) and Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT).
  6: A decision matrix is formed based on indicator variables for each grid location
    and climate scenario. A composite indicator for Perceived Impact (PI) is estimated
    using geometric aggregation of normalized indicator variables. Changes in PI are
    quantified using a risk ratio (RR).
  8: Uses daily maximum Heat Index (HI) to estimate annual maximum magnitude of summer
    extreme HS severity for short, medium (3-day rolling average), and long (7-day
    rolling average) duration events. Employs a model-ensemble average from 9 CMIP5
    global-climate models (GCMs) for future projections. HI values are bias-corrected.
    Analysis performed for CONUS, for the historical period (using reanalysis data)
    and future projections (near-future and far-future).
  12: Uses an integrated indicator for PI based on severity and temporal variability
    relative to local climate and changing population patterns. Employs a flexible
    GEV (Generalized Extreme Value) approach to quantify increases in risks from extreme
    heat exposure based on acclimation and adaptability.
More Notes:
  5: The study focuses on the CONUS (contiguous United States). The scale parameter
    of the GEV model is modeled with an exponential function.
  6: The analysis uses 3 indicator variables, 5 climate scenarios, and 210 grid locations
    within the CONUS (resolution 2x2). Equal weights (=1/3) are assigned to each indicator
    in the composite indicator calculation.
  8: The study focuses on heat stress, using Heat Index as a key metric, and doesn't
    directly translate these findings into specific macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes
    at a national level.
  12: The analysis focuses on the potential impact of Heat Stress (HS) and acknowledges
    the importance of additional determinants of vulnerability like population density
    by age group, underlying health conditions, and socioeconomic status for translating
    findings into adaptation and mitigation agendas.

    exposure and HS characteristics.

  12: Mentions 'tangible adaptation and mitigation agendas' as a desired outcome,
    but does not quantify macroeconomic or macro-fiscal outcomes.
Quantitative material:
  5: The Potential Impact (PI) is estimated for CONUS grid points combining population
    exposure with HS characteristics (40YHI and decadal trends in the spread of the
    warm tail) for five different climate scenarios and three different HS durations
    (1, 3, and 7 days).
  6: Presents equations for calculating a composite indicator of Perceived Impact
    (PI) using geometric aggregation of normalized variables (Equation 7), and a risk
    ratio (RR) for the composite indicator of PI (Equation 8).
  8: "Projected increases in 1day-HS severity up to 3.6\xB0C (6\xB0C) and 7days-HS\
    \ severity up to 2.5\xB0C (4.6\xB0C) warmer than measured air temperature beyond\
    \ mid-century based on RCP8.5. AM-HI exceeding 40.6\xB0C are expected to intensify\
    \ and spread across the US."
  12: Risk of PI is likely to increase by more than two times due to population growth
    alone in the Northeast, Southeastern Piedmont, coastal Pacific Northwest, and
    parts of Texas, Utah, and California.
