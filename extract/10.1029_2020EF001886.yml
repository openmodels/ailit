Drivers of Risk:
  1: Non-stationary HS characteristics and population exposure; Anthropogenic warming;
    Increased frequency, severity, and spatiotemporal extent of extreme temperature
    and humidity; Population growth.
  2: Changes in variance and higher-order moments of the temperature distribution,
    interactions with humidity, and population exposure.
  3: Daily maximum air temperature (Tmax) and daily mean relative humidity (RH) drive
    heat stress. Future scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 are used to project changes in
    heat stress.
  4: The primary driver of risk is extreme summer heat stress (HS), considering 1-,
    3-, and 7-day events.
  5: Extreme summer Heat Stress (HS) events, including 40-year return values of annual
    extreme summer HS events, decadal trends in warm tail spread (WTS), population
    exposure, and climate scenarios.
  6: Indicator variables (n=3) at each grid location (m=210, resolution 2x2) in the
    CONUS, and climate scenarios (S=5). Unspecified, but are used to construct xsij
    values.
  7: The paper examines the impact of climate change on heat stress exposure, focusing
    on changes in temperature projections.
  8: The primary drivers of risk are increasing temperature and absolute humidity.
    The study specifically examines extreme heat stress severity based on daily maximum
    Heat Index (HI) using 1-day, 3-day, and 7-day rolling averages. Future projections
    are based on the RCP8.5 emission scenario.
  9: The analysis focuses on changes in summer heat severity, specifically using metrics
    like 40YHI (40-year return level of Heat Index) and WTS (daily summer heat severity).
  10: Climate change and population changes.
  11: Shocks or changes impacting outcomes include increased greenhouse gas emissions,
    socioeconomic pathways, and changes in population exposure to heat stress.
  12: Global-mean warming and population growth identified as key drivers of increased
    PI risk from extreme heat.
Evaluation overview:
  1: Potential impact (PI) of summer heat stress (HS) for the contiguous United States
    (CONUS).
  2: HS (heat stress) is used as a qualitative term which describes the effect of
    extreme heat on the human body, whereas the HI (heat index) is applied as a metric
    to quantify the HS. Study focuses on the PI (potential impact) of summer (JJA)
    annual most severe HS in the present and several future climate scenarios.
  3: Health risks are the outcome being evaluated, specifically heat stress (HS) quantified
    using the heat index (HI).
  4: The paper evaluates the severity of high-end heat stress (HS) events, specifically
    the 40-year return value of the Heat Index (40YHI).
  5: Potential Impact (PI) of summer extreme Heat Stress (HS), estimated for the CONUS
    grid points.
  6: Extreme Heat Stress (HS) risk, using a composite indicator (PI)
  8: The paper evaluates the severity of extreme heat stress (HS) and its potential
    impact, focusing on regions within CONUS (Continental United States). The paper
    references mortality rates associated with high heat stress.
  9: Changes in population exposure and extreme summer heat severity characteristics
    are evaluated.
  10: Heat stress projections across the United States.
  11: The page evaluates changes in population exposure and risk of potential impact
    of high-end summer heat stress (HS) across different scenarios.
  12: Evaluates the risk increase of population impact (PI) from extreme heat stress
    (HS) in the CONUS.
Highlights:
  1: "Potential impact of short-to-medium duration (1\u20137 days) heat stress events\
    \ is likely to double in the US by 2060\u20132099; The largest increase in HS\
    \ risk is projected across the coastal Pacific Northwest, central California,\
    \ and Great Lakes; In the coastal East and many parts of the West, population\
    \ growth alone is responsible for a large share of the increases."
  2: "PI of extreme heat events is best informed through a metric that integrates\
    \ HS characteristics and the total population potentially impacted (\u201Cpopulation\
    \ exposure\u201D). Compare PI for multiple scenarios and time periods at a grid-cell\
    \ level across CONUS, allowing us to determine the changes in risk for specified\
    \ levels of severity, and for short-duration variations."
  4: The study focuses on estimating high-end heat stress severity using a non-stationary
    GEV framework to model the 40-year return value of the Heat Index.
  5: The study focuses on the disproportionate societal impacts of the most severe
    extreme heat events. The composite indicator of PI was estimated by aggregation
    of these indicators.
  6: Geometric aggregation helps ensure that risk is not underestimated, especially
    for high-end scenarios.
  7: Projections show increasing severity and geographic spread of heat stress over
    time, with higher intensity under RCP8.5 scenarios.
  8: Extreme HS severity is projected to intensify over the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast
    Atlantic coastal regions, spreading over the entire East, Midwest, and Great Plains
    under the RCP8.5 emission scenario. A significant increasing trend in annual HS
    severity is noteworthy over much of the western, south-eastern, and north-eastern
    CONUS during the recent past, with such trends expected over the whole CONUS and
    indeed the globe in future climate scenarios. HS severity under RCP4.5 increases
    until the near-future period and then stabilizes.
  9: There's a relatively higher rate of increase in WTS across the Great Lakes in
    the RCP8.5 (far-future) scenario, indicating a greater potential for heat waves.
    Decreases in WTS trends are likely in the far-future in the RCP4.5 scenarios.
  10: Visualization provides a detailed comparison of projected heat stress indices
    across time and scenarios, highlighting regional variations and the differing
    impacts of climate change and population dynamics.
  11: In the RCP8.5-SSP5 scenario, there is a significant increase in population exposure
    to severe 40YHI and variable summer extremes; a marked increase in risk ratio
    of potential impacts in specific U.S. regions.
  12: Finds a substantial increase in PI risk from extreme heat in parts of the CONUS;
    PI risk potentially doubles in some areas due to population growth alone.
Methodology:
  1: Applies the IPCC risk framework; Uses observations, climate projections from
    the CMIP5 model ensemble, and historical and future population estimates to examine
    present and projected future potential impact of summer heat stress for the contiguous
    United States.
  2: Climate change risk assessment framework using vulnerability, potential impact
    (PI) and adaptive capacity. Nonstationary frequency analysis using Generalized
    extreme value (GEV) approaches. Analysis of CMIP5 climate projections in combination
    with projected changes in population exposure under the shared socioeconomic pathways
    (SSPs). Comparison of PI for multiple scenarios and time periods at a grid-cell
    level across CONUS.
  3: "Heat index (HI) is calculated using Tmax and RH. RH is derived from dew point\
    \ temperature (Td) for historical data and specific humidity (q) and surface pressure\
    \ (Ps) for model simulations. Bias correction is applied to model-calculated HI\
    \ based on historical reanalysis data. Data is regridded to a 2\xB0 spatial resolution\
    \ within CONUS. Population data is used from 2000-2020 (using 2015 as the representative\
    \ year)."
  4: "The analysis uses a non-stationary Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) framework\
    \ applied to annual maxima of summer HI (AM-HI) to estimate the 40YHI. The analysis\
    \ covers the historical period (1980-2019), near-future (2020-2059), and far-future\
    \ (2060-2099) under different climate scenarios (present, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5).\
    \ The GEV model incorporates non-stationarity by allowing the location (\u03BC\
    ) and scale (\u03C3) parameters to vary with time (linearly or quadratically for\
    \ \u03BC, linearly for \u03C3), while keeping the shape parameter (\u03BE) constant.\
    \ Population data are interpolated to annual estimates and aggregated to a 2\xB0\
    \ grid resolution."
  5: Uses non-stationary frequency analysis with GEV models selected based on Bayesian
    Information Criteria (BIC) and Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT). The PI is estimated
    by combining indicators of population exposure with HS characteristics (40YHI
    and decadal trends in the spread of the warm tail) for five climate scenarios
    and three HS durations (1, 3, and 7 days), using an indicator-based assessment
    technique to determine a composite indicator.
  6: A decision matrix (xsij) is constructed from indicator variables for each grid
    location and climate scenario. A composite indicator is calculated using geometric
    aggregation of normalized variables (rsij) with equal weights (1/3). Risk Ratio
    (RR) is then calculated for the composite indicator. This is applicable for events
    of durations 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days.
  7: Changes in heat stress exposure are investigated using a Relative Risk (RR) framework,
    considering climate change and population changes separately and in interaction.
  8: The study uses a reanalysis dataset for historical data and model-ensemble averages
    from 9 CMIP5 global climate models (GCMs) for future projections. Model-computed
    HI values are bias-corrected. It analyzes annual maximum magnitude of summer extreme
    HS severity for short, medium and long duration events. The study also investigates
    extreme summer HS characteristics and trends in WTS (likely related to wet-bulb
    temperature).
  9: The analysis uses climate scenarios (RCP8.5 and RCP4.5) to project future conditions
    and examines spatial patterns of decadal trends in WTS. Ellipses represent probability
    density functions, and trends are examined using spatial plots.
  10: The analysis uses different climate projection models or scenarios (RCP4.5,
    SSP2, etc.) and considers the total effect, climate change effect, population
    effect, and interaction effect on heat stress.
  11: Analysis is based on mean population estimates and risk ratios (RR) using gridded
    mean population estimates fixed to the 2015 population, and examines scenarios
    SSP2 and SSP5 with RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 levels of emissions.
  12: Utilizes a Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) approach to assess risks across different
    event types and durations.
More Notes:
  1: Focuses on short-to-medium duration (1-7 days) heat stress events.
  3: The study uses a decomposition approach to assess the relative importance of
    climate and population changes on health risks.
  4: The paper uses the Block Maxima (BM) method to focus on yearly maxima of summer
    HI. The SSP2 and SSP5 scenarios were selected to reflect moderate and highest
    socioeconomic challenges that extreme heat may pose.
  5: "The scale parameter (\u03C3) in the GEV model is modeled with an exponential\
    \ function to ensure only positive values are considered. Procedures used in the\
    \ non-stationary frequency analysis are discussed in Appendix section A.3 and\
    \ A.4 in the Supporting Information."
  6: The paper uses min-max normalization to scale indicator variables to a 0-1 range
    before aggregation. The decision matrix uses n=3 indicator variables, S=5 climate
    scenarios, and m=210 grid locations in the CONUS.
  8: The paper emphasizes that the variable of interest, heat stress, shows different
    trends in the Midwest and South than observed when analyzing extreme temperatures
    alone. Spatial structures are smoothed out in future projections due to model
    averaging.
  9: The study suggests particular challenges for heat acclimation and adaptation
    in the Great Lakes region.
  10: The page includes maps and box plots to present the projected heat stress indices
    and their drivers.
  12: The study emphasizes the importance of considering factors like population density
    by age, health, and socioeconomic status for adaptation and mitigation strategies.
Quantitative material:
  1: "PI of short-to-medium duration (1\u20137 days) HS events is likely to increase\
    \ more than three-fold across densely populated regions by late this century (2060\u2013\
    2099) under the highest emissions scenario; Climate change alone more than doubles\
    \ the impact in the coastal Pacific Northwest, central California, and the Great\
    \ Lakes region."
  3: Uses climate models (CMIP5) and population data (GPWv4) to quantify heat stress
    impacts. Historical analysis covers 1979-2019, projections extend to 2100.
  4: The paper estimates the magnitude of the 40YHI, which represents the heat index
    value expected to be exceeded only once every 40 years, corresponding to an annual
    exceedance probability of 0.025. Population estimates from SSP2 and SSP5 are used.
  5: Calculation of 40-year return values of annual extreme summer HS events.
  6: Risk Ratio (RR) for the composite indicator of PI is calculated. The composite
    indicator is a geometric aggregation of normalized indicator values. The normalization
    is performed with the min-max method to a 0-1 range.
  9: "The figures show changes in 40YHI, WTS trends in \xB0C/decade, and population\
    \ exposure."
  10: Maps show the total projected increase in heat stress indices under different
    scenarios for three future periods, with color gradients indicating varying levels
    of increased heat stress.
  11: The analysis highlights a likely more than 3x increase in the risk of potential
    impact in some regions under the RCP8.5-SSP5 scenario.
