Drivers of Risk:
  2: Climate change leading to uncertainties in water availability, and population
    growth increasing water demand.
  8: Population growth increases demand for water supplies. Sustainability reductions
    increase demand for water supplies. Drier climates increase demand for water supplies.
  10: Population growth, climate change (Low & Wet, Central, High & Dry scenarios).
  11: Climate change (implied via 'climatic scenarios'), population growth, per capita
    consumption (demand), infrastructure capacity.
  12: Population growth and climate change (specifically drought) drive water demand
    and necessitate adaptation.
  14: Climate change (leading to drier climates), population growth (increasing water
    demand), and socio-economic scenarios are key drivers of risk in water management.
  17: Changes in water use, leakage, and future flows hydrology.
  19: Minimum residual flow, licensed maximum abstraction for river, drought conditions,
    population growth, and climate change (specifically drier climates) drive the
    risk to water supply.
  22: "\u0394C (change in capacity)"
  23: Linear extrapolation of existing water resource infrastructure costs may be
    unsound if the relationships are non-linear; significant local factors which influence
    cost; future technologies alter costs; cost estimates given by water companies
    do not include all construction and maintenance costs; operating costs are based
    on the maximum capacity of any asset investments (which might over-estimate costs
    of options).
Highlights:
  2: Balanced approach involving inter-basin water transfers, local solutions, and
    scalable demand management strategies best addresses water trilemma.
  8: System Efficiency (SE) and System Restructure (SR) strategies are the only two
    that have demand management and leakage reduction that actually reduce total water
    use in the face of population growth.  In the No Build (NB) strategy water supplied,
    CO2e emissions and the reliability measure increase for the scenarios with higher
    population growth rates and drier climates.
  10: Water shortages are projected in the 'high and dry' scenario and many in the
    'central' scenario if only 2015 infrastructure is available in 2040.
  11: Widespread reduction in per capita consumption alone is not able to prevent
    reliability issues in all WRZs in all climate and population scenarios. The Capacity
    Expansion strategy, while able to achieve similar reliability as the Minimum Intervention
    strategy, results in more water being abstracted and higher emissions. Even with
    no limits on spending, the Capacity Expansion strategy cannot guarantee water
    security. National Planning strategy can potentially provide water security across
    the nation.
  12: System Restructure (SR) and System Efficiency (SE) were the most preferred adaptation
    strategies overall.
  17: The GBWIM model can be used to assess future water resources from a supply/demand
    perspective under a range of investment strategies.
  19: The analysis focuses on quantifying water supply yields and how different management
    strategies can offset the impact of demand growth under varying climate and population
    scenarios.
  22: Presents a framework for costing different water management options and selecting
    investments based on minimizing total present value costs.
  23: The optimization module aims to find the minimum cost investment in water resource
    infrastructure.
  25: Water companies face sustainability reductions in water supply starting in various
    years. Different population and climate scenarios impact net demand growth, requiring
    different water supply management strategies.
Methodology:
  2: Simulation of future river flow projections using an aggregated national water
    resource model to test policies for managing demand and supply.
  8: The impact of three scenarios (low, central, high population growth) and five
    water management strategies on the supply/demand balance in 2040 is modeled. An
    ELECTRE III method was used with sensitivity analysis involving calculating the
    average ELECTRE ranking across preference sets and scenarios.
  10: Modeling water balance for companies in 2040 under different scenarios and adaptation
    strategies.
  11: Simulation of water balances for each water company in 2040 under different
    socio-economic and climatic scenarios; comparison of different investment strategies
    (Minimum Intervention, System Efficiency, Capacity Expansion, National Planning,
    Standard Response) involving different approaches to demand management and infrastructure
    investment. The geographic boundaries of water companies are shown in the images.
  12: Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) using the ELECTRE III algorithm was
    performed to rank strategies, with sensitivity analysis across 240 runs and three
    scenarios.
  14: The paper uses a streamlined model of water supply-demand balance at a water
    resource zone level, incorporating storage, demand, leakage management, inter-zonal
    transfers, and geographically explicit estimates of changing water demand. The
    model examines various water management strategies across different scenarios
    and stakeholder preferences, and allows any number of strategies for examination
    across many different scenarios, strategies and stakeholder preference sets.
  17: The GBWIM model tracks the water balance and availability of water at the WRZ
    scale, aggregating estimates of surface and groundwater availability. It simulates
    the effect of investment in water infrastructure and changes in water use and
    leakage. Baseline water supply projections are converted into supply quantities
    available for future abstraction under different investment strategies.
  19: The paper uses a model to calculate water yields based on minimum residual flows,
    licensed abstractions, and drought return periods. Reservoir yields are calculated
    using an iterative numerical approach considering reservoir storage and input
    abstractions. The time frame shown for net demand growth in one chart is 2015-2040.
  22: Costing of reservoir expansions and water transfers using regression models
    for Capex and Opex. An optimal planning decision algorithm minimises the Total
    Present Value Costs per unit of water supplied.
  23: The analysis uses an optimization model to find the minimum cost investment
    across different water supply management options, considering capital and operating
    expenditures, discounted at 5%. Implemented interventions increase water supply
    from the following year onwards.
  25: "ELECTRE III MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis) is used. Analysis utilizes\
    \ Water Resource Management Plans (WRMP) 2014 and Water UK\u2019s \u201Cbase\u201D\
    \ scenario. Sensitivity analysis involves a 50% increase and decrease in ELECTRE\
    \ III parameter values."
More Notes:
  8: "The study considers alternative preference sets: \u201CSecurity & Cost\u201D\
    , \u201CNo Preference\u201D, and \u201CGreen is Good\u201D, each with different\
    \ weightings for Reliability, Total Cost, Water Supplied, and CO2 emissions."
  10: The 'System Efficiency' strategy assumes lower per capita consumption reductions
    than some other studies. The range of water balances presented is not as extreme
    as those presented in the WaterUK report due to less extreme drought scenarios.
  11: The analysis focuses on the water sector and the impacts of climate change and
    population growth on water supply and demand, considering different adaptation
    strategies.
  12: The System Restructure (SR) strategy achieves no water restrictions with a combination
    of demand management and traditional/emerging investment options. The System Efficiency
    (SE) strategy performs better on environmental criteria.
  14: The model provides a consistent methodology for analysing water management strategies
    for all water companies. Inter-company transfers can provide water security, but
    relying solely on them may lead to cost overruns due to infrastructure requirements
    in multiple regions. The paper acknowledges limitations and calls for further
    improvements to the fidelity of the analysis.
  17: The model uses the Future Flows Hydrology (FFH) dataset and water company data
    to estimate deployable outputs within each Water Resource Zone (WRZ). The model
    uses sub-catchment areas for river abstractions.
  19: The analysis is specific to water supply and does not directly address macroeconomic
    or macro-fiscal outcomes. The geographic focus appears to be the UK based on the
    water company maps.
  22: "The discount rate is set at 5%. Water transfers (TR) are modelled as a function\
    \ of distance water is transferred (km) (parameter \u07DC)."
  23: The analysis focuses on the water sector and uses simplifying assumptions regarding
    cost estimation and operating costs. The options module records each implemented
    option by year and quantity of water provided/saved.
  25: The study focuses on water supply management in England and Wales. The map images
    show geographical boundaries of water companies. The bar chart illustrates the
    impact of demand growth, sustainability reductions, and management strategies
    on water supply under different scenarios. The maps using the color gradient depict
    the data in different visualizations across geographic areas.
