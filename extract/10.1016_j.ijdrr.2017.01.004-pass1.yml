Drivers of Risk:
  1: Disasters
  3: Increasing frequency and severity of disasters in Australia.
  5: Natural disasters.
  7: The variation in damage cost estimates depending on the data sources used highlights
    differences in cost categories captured and how they impact conclusions.
  8: Changes in number and value of dwellings, as well as building regulations
  9: Floods (28.9%), severe storms (26.2%), and cyclones (24.5%) are the most costly
    disaster types in Australia.
  10: Natural disasters in Australia from 1967 until 2013.
  11: Severe storms, floods, cyclones, bushfires, and heatwaves.
  12: Tropical cyclones, floods, bushfires, storms, earthquakes.
  13: Natural disasters including tropical cyclones, earthquakes, extreme temperatures,
    storms, floods, landslides, droughts, and bushfires.
  14: Natural disasters (including drought)
  15: Meteorological disasters (storms, floods, heatwaves, bushfires, etc.), earthquakes.
  16: Natural disasters (weather-related events)
  17: Disasters (presumably climate-related, though not explicitly stated on this
    page).
  19: Natural disasters, including drought.
  21: No explicit shocks or changes impacting macroeconomic or fiscal outcomes are
    described.
  22: Tropical cyclones, severe storms, floods, hailstorms, bushfires, earthquakes
  24: Severe storms, floods, tropical cyclones, bushfires, earthquakes, and landslides.
  29: Not explicitly stated, but implied to be related to insured events causing economic
    losses.
  30: Bushfires and the limitations in economic estimates of disaster costs.
  31: Disasters (cyclones, bushfires, earthquakes, hailstorms, floods).
  32: Natural disasters, climate change increasing prevalence and severity of natural
    disasters, increasing wealth, population and density.
  36: Natural hazards, disasters (floods, bushfires).
Highlights:
  1: The paper compares different ways of estimating disaster costs in Australia.
  3: There is no single answer to the question of how much disasters cost Australia
    due to varying estimates and interpretations.
  5: Major difficulties in providing a full economic analysis stem from a lack of
    data, poor data quality, lack of precise definition of cost categories, vague
    or variable temporal and geographical limitations, limited loss indicators, irregular
    frequency of updates and a lack of reliability assessment; Insurance data accounts
    for insured losses only, and as such represents only a fraction of the total cost
    of a disaster; Insurance cost data is used because it is often the only standardized
    proxy available.
  7: The analysis underscores the influence of data and methodology on the conclusions
    drawn regarding economic losses from weather-related disasters.
  8: No observable trends in disaster losses over time, once building number, value
    and standards have been accounted for.
  9: Floods, severe storms and cyclones are the most costly disaster types. Bushfires
    had the largest impact on human life.
  10: Most comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of total economic loss from disasters
    in Australia; average annual costs of disasters between 1967 and 2013 was $3.26
    billion (2013AUD).
  11: Queensland and New South Wales account for 58.5% of the total costs of disasters
    in Australia; Severe storms and floods are the most costly types of disaster;
    Heatwaves accounted for 50% of all deaths recorded in the analysis and their costs
    are potentially underestimated.
  12: Building damage since 1900 is almost entirely due to meteorological hazards
    (floods, cyclones, bushfires, storms).
  13: Risk Frontiers database is the most comprehensive for fatalities and damage
    to buildings in Australia. Australia ranks highly in frequency of disaster globally
    (Guha-Sapir et al. (2004)).
  14: Australia has high bushfire costs and significant economic losses from natural
    disasters.
  15: Australian average annual weather-related damage estimated at $1.22 billion
    (1967-2006, normalised insured losses). Average annual cost of disasters between
    $1.75 billion (1967-1999, broader loss estimates) and $3.26 billion (1967-2013,
    broader loss estimates from multiple sources).
  16: Australia is among the top 10 countries globally for the number of disasters
    and for the most expensive bushfire globally.
  17: Different disaster databases report significantly different numbers of disasters,
    likely due to differing aims and inclusion criteria. EM-DAT consistently recorded
    the fewest disasters, while BTE reported the most for several decades.
  19: Different studies report widely varying estimates of the average annual total
    cost of natural disasters in Australia due to differences in data sources and
    methodologies.
  21: Large disasters in Australia may be increasing, with more occurring in the last
    decade potentially due to better reporting and comprehensive assessment of losses.
  22: Shows a comparison of the top ten most costly disasters in Australia based on
    different metrics, highlighting the impact of events like Tropical Cyclone Tracy,
    Melbourne Severe Storm, Queensland Flood, and Sydney Hailstorm.
  24: Severe storms and floods are the most expensive disaster types in Australia.
    Bushfires, earthquakes, and landslides are the least expensive. Heatwaves caused
    over 50% of deaths between 1967 and 2013.
  29: Estimates of economic losses associated with unspecified events impacting Victoria
    (VIC) and South Australia (SA), spanning insured losses, direct/indirect costs,
    and intangible costs.
  30: Insurance data provides a conservative estimate of losses, representing only
    a fraction of overall losses; full economic impact assessments yield higher estimates
    but still lack many potential loss items.
  31: New South Wales and Queensland have the highest costs and number of disasters
    of Australian states.
  32: Continued and expanded investment in disaster risk reduction is a 'no-regrets'
    policy option for Australia, economically warranted regardless of climate change
    acknowledgment.
  36: The need for data on natural disasters; improving disaster data.
Methodology:
  1: Comparison of disaster cost estimates.
  3: Compares a selection of different approaches used to cost natural disasters in
    Australia.
  5: Disaster cost estimates are largely drawn from the Insurance Council of Australia's
    (ICA) Historical Disaster Statistics or insurance data with some augmentation.
  7: Comparison of economic loss evaluations from domestic and international reports,
    with data adjusted to 2013 dollars using the RBA inflation calculator, and consideration
    of the influence of data and methodology on conclusions.
  8: Normalises historical insured losses (1966-2011) using ICA data to 2011 conditions,
    controlling for changes in dwelling numbers, values, and building regulations.
  9: "Analysis based on the Emergency Management Australia (EMA) database (now EM\
    \ Knowledge Hub) adjusted for inflation, but not for changes in wealth or population.\
    \ The report includes estimates of insured loss, \u2018estimated total loss\u2019\
    \ and the value of loss of life and injury where known."
  10: Draws on the AUS-DIS database, which includes insured loss, estimated total
    loss, and the value of loss of life and injury; normalisation procedure updated
    from prior reports.
  12: Blong [34] uses the Risk Frontiers database and expresses disaster impacts in
    terms of house equivalents (HE) by comparing floor areas and per m2 construction
    costs.
  13: Risk Frontiers database uses newspaper reports and other sources to track fatalities
    and building damage from 1788 onwards. Guha-Sapir et al. (2004) summarize the
    impacts of disasters globally over 30 years.
  14: 'The paper references several disaster databases: EM-DAT, AUS-DIS, and Risk
    Frontiers. EM-DAT is used for most global reports on natural disaster trends and
    relies heavily on national reporting. Inclusion in the EM-DAT database requires
    the event to have caused any of the following: 10 deaths, 100 people to be affected,
    a state of emergency to be declared, or a call for national assistance to be made.'
  15: Analysis based on insurance losses, broader loss estimates (EMA database), reports,
    journals, databases, media (AUS-DIS), scientific and government reports, BoM,
    Geoscience Australia and Risk Frontiers database. Normalisation techniques include
    adjusting for population, wealth, inflation, and building standards.
  16: Time series analysis of disaster losses in Australia; Analysis of losses by
    state and disaster type; Comparison of disaster statistics in a global context
  17: The paper compares disaster counts from different databases; no analytical method
    is described on this page.
  21: Methods involve using original data for estimating losses and consideration
    if data is partially or fully normalized; differences highlight the influence
    of methodology on loss estimates.
  22: Compares disaster losses using different metrics (normalized insured losses,
    normalized total losses, house equivalent losses) from different reports (Handmer,
    Ladds and Magee; Crompton; Blong) over different time periods (1967-2013 or 1967-2003).
  29: Economic analysis from various sources; Insured losses estimates augmented with
    media reports; ICA database augmented to give an 'overall' loss estimate.
  30: The variation in cost estimates is attributed to different data sources and
    methodologies, including insurance data, full economic impact assessments, and
    Ministerial Statements. Normalization is not performed, resulting in crude estimates
    for comparison only.
  36: Analysis of disaster databases; assessing flood hazard zones; assessing risk
    and reducing disaster.
More Notes:
  1: The paper is accepted for publication in the International Journal of Disaster
    Risk Reduction. It compares estimates, so is ex-post (after an event occurred).
  3: The $9 billion and $33 billion estimates did not consider climate change, indirect
    or intangible damages, so the actual value would be expected to be much higher.
  5: Payments from insurance can be classified as a benefit, rather than a loss or
    cost in a full economic impact assessment.
  8: Study is limited by reliance on household insurance data, which excludes uninsured
    losses and assets.
  9: The EM Knowledge Hub is freely available and contains statistics on human losses
    (death, injury, evacuated and homeless) and tangible losses (buildings, transport
    vehicles, infrastructure, crops and livestock).
  10: The 10 largest events accounted for about a third of the cost of disasters between
    1967 and 2013.
  11: The AUS-DIS database was created to address limitations of a previous report
    (BTE 2001) and includes direct, indirect, and intangible losses from 1967-2013
    for disasters costing over $10 million (2013 dollars) or causing three or more
    deaths.
  12: Heatwave deaths are not included in Blong's analysis, despite being responsible
    for more deaths than all other natural hazards combined from 1844 to 2010 (according
    to Risk Frontiers [32]).
  13: Risk Frontiers database has limitations including reliance on newspaper reports,
    underestimation of building damage, and incomplete records, and is not publicly
    available. Guha-Sapir et al. (2004) do not explain how total losses were calculated.
  14: The paper mentions limitations of the EM-DAT database and highlights the strengths
    and weaknesses of different disaster cost databases. The quality of the EM-DAT
    data depends on national and institutional data collection approaches.
  15: The analyses use different data sources (Insurance Council of Australia, EMA,
    AUS-DIS, Risk Frontiers) with varying coverage (insured vs. broader losses, inclusion
    of heatwaves and earthquakes) and reliability. Some datasets are normalised for
    population, wealth, inflation, and building standards.
  16: Disaster loss recording in Australia was made a priority in 1967, when the ICA
    database began recording historical data losses.
  17: AUS-DIS and EM Knowledge Hub focus on economic damages exceeding $10 million,
    while EM-DAT focuses on human losses. The EM Knowledge Hub has reduced the number
    of disasters it includes online over time.
  19: The Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) significantly underestimates the total
    economic cost of disasters. Media reports often exaggerate the reported losses
    from disaster events.
  21: Disasters like the Black Saturday bushfire are assessed with precision, including
    intangible and indirect losses.
  22: The paper compares rankings and loss estimates from different reports, noting
    that comprehensive analysis can increase the perceived cost of a disaster compared
    to earlier disasters with less detailed analysis.
  24: The cost of earthquakes is mainly from a single event, the 1999 Newcastle earthquake.
  27: The page focuses on disaster loss assessments, particularly from bushfires,
    and highlights the variability in loss estimations due to different data and methodologies.
    It appears to be setting up a comparison of different assessments of the same
    event (Ash Wednesday bushfires).
  29: The estimates are from various sources and methodologies, making direct comparison
    difficult. The year of the original event is 1983 for some of the data from ICA
    and Munich Re.
  30: Data on disaster costs in Australia and globally suffers from a lack of availability,
    poor data quality, temporal and geographical limitations, lack of regularity of
    updating and maintenance, and little or no reliability analysis.
  32: "The paper acknowledges the need to include heatwaves and indirect/intangible\
    \ losses in future cost estimates. Paper based on work for the National Emergency\
    \ Management Projects (NEMP) project \u201CUpdating the BTE (Australian Bureau\
    \ of Transport Economics) (2001) report: The Economic Costs of Natural Disasters\

    to rise to $33 billion a year by 2050.
  5: Insurance data is a standardized proxy for disaster costs, though it only represents
    a fraction of the total cost.
  8: Average Australian annual weather-related (normalised) insured losses to be $1.22
    billion (2013AUD) (and just the last 10 years $1.52 billion).
  9: 'Average annual cost of disasters: $1.75 billion (2013AUD) or $1.32 billion (2013AUD)
    excluding three major events. Floods account for 28.9% of the total cost, severe
    storms 26.2%, and cyclones 24.5%. Bushfires account for 7.1% of the total cost
    but caused 223 deaths (39.5%) and over 4,000 injuries (57.4%).'

  16: Annual average loss of $1.65 billion (2013 AUD) in Australia
  17: Figure 1 provides a comparison of the number of disasters recorded in different
    databases (AUS-DIS, BTE, EMA Knowledge Hub, ICA, EM-DAT) across different decades
    (1967-1969, 1970-1979, 1980-1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, 2010-2013).
  19: The average annual total cost of natural disasters is reported as $1.75 billion
    (from BTE [5]), $3.65 billion (from Handmer, et al. [26]), and $2.10 billion (from
    Guha-Sapir, et al. [1]). Guha-Sapir, et al. [1]'s estimate includes $0.64 billion
    in losses from drought, resulting in a total loss of $1.46 billion when drought
    is removed.
  21: 'Quantitative estimates are provided: disasters costing $0.97 and $0.33 billion
    annually when fatalities are included.'
  22: Table provides normalized insured and total losses (2013 AUD million) for top
    disaster events in Australia, along with house equivalent losses. Includes reported
    and normalized losses from different reports for various events and years.
  24: Table 3 provides the percentage of loss from different hazards (excluding heatwaves)
    by database (EMA, AUS-DIS, PerilAus, ICA, EM-DAT) for various time periods. For
    example, severe storms accounted for 26% of losses in the EMA database (1967-1999),
    while floods accounted for 29%.
  29: Yes, several cost estimates in 2013 AUD are provided ranging from $556,294,201
    to $1,872,435,155.
  30: Cost estimates for the Ash Wednesday bushfires range from $556 million to $1,872
    million (2013 AUD).
  31: Total annual insured costs of disasters in 2050 are estimated at $23 billion;
    When also incorporating social losses this estimate is inflated dramatically to
    $33 billion a year.
  32: Reference to spending 'millions' annually on disaster mitigation. Cost estimates
    are considered a conservative 'first pass' at the wider cost.
